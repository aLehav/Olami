The announcement comes just two days before the Trojans start their 2013 regular season at Cal State Fullerton on Friday.
“It was unfortunate. I’m forever grateful for Coach Cruz,” junior infielder Kevin Swick said. “He allowed me to play here and he was a great coach while he was here.”
Cruz was suspended from all coaching duties last Thursday pending an investigation by the USC Office of Athletic Compliance, led by Vice President Dave Roberts. Roberts and his staff found that the baseball program exceeded the regulated number of CARA hours.
The CARA rules restrict the amount of time players spend participating in activities under the supervision of coaching staff. Student-athletes are limited to 20 hours per week during the season and eight hours per week during offseason.
The activities recognized by the NCAA include typical athletic practice, film review and even simply participating in a game of catch with a member of the coaching staff.
“Adhering to all NCAA rules is paramount for each one of our coaches, student-athletes and staff members,” Haden said in a statement Wednesday. “Those who knowingly break NCAA rules are subject to termination.”
USC also announced its decision to reduce the number of hours the team spends practicing for the upcoming season and the following season next year. The university notified the NCAA and the Pac-12 conference of the violations and its impending self-imposed actions.
Associate head coach Dan Hubbs, who served as interim head coach during Cruz’s brief suspension and is entering his third coaching year at USC, has been named head coach.
“It’s obviously bittersweet because I love Frank Cruz and he gave me the opportunity to come back to my alma mater,” Hubbs said. “He and I are friends. It’s never easy to see something like this happen to one of your friends.”
Hubbs, 42, earned All-American honors as a pitcher for the Trojans and served as pitching coach for 12 seasons at Cal. He also spent seven years pitching in the minor leagues.
“I’m confident that Dan Hubbs and his staff will lead our team to a successful season,” Haden said in a statement. “Dan is a good coach, he is highly regarded in the baseball community and he has strong Trojan roots.”
Hubbs said that moving forward, his plans for the team won’t deviate from the vision that the coaching staff developed as a whole, but that he might make tweaks as he sees fit. For now, he is focused on making sure his players are ready for their first game Friday.
“We’re trying to get as much as we can get done in a confined time frame,” Hubbs said. “But I think the team has been great in terms of their energy and their willingness to just keep moving on.”
In fact, the sudden change hasn’t had much of an effect on players yet, Swick said. They still have their goals set on playing well and eventually advancing to playoffs and regionals.
Hubbs echoed these sentiments and said that the main priority is the immediate future, specifically the start of the season and the team’s first game.
“My message to the team is we have one goal right now — we have one focus right now and that has to be Fullerton on Friday,” Hubbs said.

Distinguished biographer Robert Caro, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, said Wednesday night that his job has larger implications than simply recording the life of a historical figure.
Life lesson · Biographer Robert Caro speaks to students at Town and Gown Wednesday about chronicling President Lyndon B. Johnson’s life. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Caro delivered the Dennis F. and Brooks Holt Distinguished Lecture at Town and Gown touching on his most recent biography of President Lyndon B. Johnson and the role of power in government.
“I never think of my books as just the biography of … Lyndon B. Johnson,” Caro said. “When I started writing books, I never had an interest in writing a biography simply to record the life of one person. I try to use the life of a great man to explore the forces that shape his time, particularly political power.”
The biography, Lyndon B. Johnson: The Passage of Power, is the fourth book in a five-volume series titled The Years of Lyndon Johnson. on the life of the 36th president of the United States.
To Caro, political power is a key force in shaping contemporary social issues, just as it was at the time of the Johnson presidency.
“We’re in a democracy, so ultimately, power comes from the votes we cast at the ballot box,” Caro said. “Power comes from us, so the political power … the raw, naked reality of what political power really is, the more informed our votes will be, and therefore the better our democracy will become.”
The event, which was part of a lecture series jointly sponsored by the Price School of Public Policy and the Bedrosian Center on Governance, was open to an audience of students and guests.
For students interested in public policy and government, Caro’s lecture gave insight on their fields of study. Yet some students, such as Sam Dorn, a sophomore double majoring in broadcast and digital journalism and political science, were disappointed with the lack of variety in subject matter.
“I’ve read all of his books and it seemed like he was basically restating the information from his books, with short anecdotes about his interviews,” Dorn said. “As a journalist, I found that interesting, but it wasn’t really what I came here to see.”
However, Aubrey Hicks, assistant director of the Bedrosian Center, said that Caro tried to touch on issues of interest for both graduate and undergraduate students of politics.
“Thinking about governance and what it means to be a citizen, as well as what [Caro] said about how power comes from the people … is very interesting in terms of what we want to talk about in this lecture series,” she said.
The series continues on Feb. 19 with a lecture by former L.A. mayor Richard J. Riordan.

25) Google “The USS Liberty, Israel & President Johnson’s Order to Destroy the USS Liberty”
26) “Lyndon Johnson the Tragic Self: A Psychohistorical Portrait” by Hyman Muslim & Thomas Jobe
I grew up in Texas with sons and daughters of oil men from Dallas and Houston, the kids of politicians and lawyers in Austin. I knew LBJ and his nephews. I went to high school with them.
I believed in 1963 that Lee Oswald killed JFK and that was the end of the story. After fifty years of study and some very disappointing and disturbing realizations, I am certain that those oil men, the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover and LBJ were essentially the murderers of JFK and RFK. I didn’t want to this to be true. I knew and loved some of those people who wanted the Kennedys dead and wanted LBJ in power. So, when Robert Caro, a person I met while working in the LBJ Library, skipped over the assassination of JFK without even a shadow of a comment, I was disappointed. I can understand why Bob did this. It is too complicated a situation to fit into his massive and excellent history of LBJ. I know that he is going to give LBJ failing grades for getting us into Viet Nam at the urging of his defense contract buddies, but I doubt he will ever re-visit the deaths of JFK or RFK. I can only hope that he has TWO more books coming. The “last” LBJ book will deal with the Viet Nam war and the “very last” book will confirm my own knowledge of that shameful day in Dallas.
Robert Caro was quite fascinating when I saw him on C-SPAN’s Book-TV, but I have to agree with you on the JFK assassination (as least in regards to the cover-up, no matter who was ultimately responsible).

In serious need of a victory, the USC men’s volleyball team will look to right the ship this week with the first of a four-game homestand to continue Mountain Pacific Sports Federation action.
William Ehart | Daily TrojanLeading the way · Sophomore middle blocker Robert Feathers (right) has tallied 34 blocks and a team-leading .490 kill percentage this season. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
The Trojans square off against Cal Baptist Thursday night at the Galen Center in an attempt to end its current four-game losing streak. After a home loss to Pacific, the Trojans concluded a disappointing 0-3 road trip that featured losses to Pepperdine, Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State. The losing streak marks the team’s longest since 2008.
“We haven’t put it together all the way yet,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “The theme of our last few matches is that we’ve put together some strings of great volleyball, but we really need an extended period of good, and that’s what we’ve been talking to the guys about.”
Each of the four losses has come by a 3-1 margin, with the Trojans faltering down the stretch after short periods of strong play. Against Long Beach State on Friday, USC fell behind early, dropping the first two sets and failing to put together a comeback. Though the Trojans received strong contributions from key players, such as sophomore middle blockers Ben Lam (13 kills, five blocks, .579) and Robert Feathers (10 kills and five blocks), they were out-hit .370 to .271, failing to contain the 49ers in the deciding fourth frame.
“We had some matchups offensively and I thought our game plan was good. Our middle blockers and [redshirt junior opposite] Tanner Jansen executed wonderfully,” Ferguson said. “Jansen’s hitting percentage over the last three matches is .343, and he and the middle blockers are coming through for us. I see the outside hitters having better matches, so as soon as some of those guys can be a little more consistent offensively, things will start to balance out.”
The loss to Northridge was particularly tough for the Trojans, who saw Jansen explode for a career-high 24 kills and a .475 attacking percentage. However, on the strength of 40 combined kills from opposite hitters John Baker and Brandon Lebrock, the Matadors put away the Trojans, who were again out-hit and out-performed defensively.
“We had good matchups and a good game plan that created open looks for Jansen. That was part of our match that we were pleased with as a team,” Ferguson said. “We knew what was going on defensively, but we didn’t execute as well on the blocking, which was a step back from the Pepperdine game where we had tremendous blocking. We didn’t block or dig really well, and those are things we typically do well.”
Though the losses would normally serve as a cause for concern, Ferguson stressed the need to remain positive and patient, noting in particular the youth and depth present on the roster.
“We’ve been telling the guys that they’re here for a reason,” Ferguson said. “We believe in them, we trust them and we recruited them. They’re just a bit inexperienced, and we have to walk that fine line between understanding that there’s going to be a learning curve and speeding up that curve a little bit.”
Thursday’s game against Cal Baptist is set to begin at the Galen Center at 7 p.m.

The news of Frank Cruz’s firing on Wednesday marked the latest occurrence in USC baseball’s steady decline into irrelevance, following a generation of dominance over the college baseball landscape.
Here’s something that I’m betting most current USC students don’t know: USC’s baseball program is generally considered to be the most dominant in the history of college baseball. The Trojans have won 12 national championships since the College World Series was created. The next highest teams? LSU and Texas, with six apiece.
Think about that for a moment. In the 66 years that the College World Series has been in existence, USC has won nearly one in five times and twice as much as any other team.
This is all the more surprising when you consider that the Trojans’ last national championship came in 1998, and before that season, the team hadn’t hoisted the trophy since way back in 1978.
So from 1947 to 1978, USC’s baseball team won the national championship 10 out of 32 times.
What’s happened since then?
Despite qualifying for the NCAA tournament just once (2005) in the past 10 seasons, USC can still comfortably call itself the traditional powerhouse of college baseball. But with the way the team has played in the last decade, memories of past glory have become increasingly difficult to fall back on.
So what exactly is to blame for the cavernous drop off that the program has suffered? USC has been incredibly fortunate in terms of head coaching stability throughout the glory years. Consider that from 1942 to 1986, USC saw six head football coaches, seven head basketball coaches and five school presidents, but only one head baseball coach: the legendary Rod Dedeaux.
During his time as USC’s head coach, Dedeaux led the Trojans to 11 national championships, one of which he won as co-head coach alongside Sam Barry. He retired as the winningest baseball coach in NCAA history and was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. USC named its baseball field after him in 1974 and, in 1999, he was named Coach of the Century by Collegiate Baseball.
Basically, if a Mount Rushmore of college baseball existed, there would be no doubt that Dedeaux would be on it.
Following Dedeaux’s retirement, USC again struck gold with its selection of Mike Gillespie as head coach. Gillespie led the team from 1987 to 2006, earning four College World Series appearances and one national championship. Though he failed to match the success the program experienced under Dedeaux, Gillespie’s tenure at USC was certainly nothing to scoff at.
Unfortunately, Gillespie’s retirement marked the end of USC’s run of long-term baseball coaches. Chad Kreuter took over control of the program in 2007 and was fired in 2010 after failing to reach the postseason each year. Cruz’s record in his brief two-year run at the school was 48-63 and included an 11th place finish in the Pac-12 last season.
Gillespie’s decision to step down following the 2006 season was a surprise to many at the time, and it seems as though, seven years later, USC still hasn’t recovered from the shock. Relative to how long past coaches were able to stay at USC, Kreuter had a very short leash as the team’s coach. Granted, he didn’t turn in results that warranted extra time, but perhaps the pressure of replacing not one but two college baseball legends was too much to bear.
Cruz fared no better in his two years, suggesting that the program is still far from reaching a state of stability. His firing only further complicates things for a team that must replace its top four leaders in innings pitched from a season ago as well as last year’s team leader in hits.
Now, the program so storied in past glory is left searching again for the right man for the job. In one sense, his firing for violating NCAA rules is a positive in that it shows that Athletic Director Pat Haden is serious in his diligent mission to run a squeaky clean athletic program. But it would be inaccurate to say that the baseball program is better for having to hire its third head coach in four years.
USC can still rest easy in knowing that its lead in all-time national championships is safe for the foreseeable future. Still, this is an athletic program that does not take kindly to mediocrity, especially for a program as storied as USC baseball.
The task will be tough for this year’s team to make progress toward any kind of return to prominence. USC will feature plenty of new faces this season, which is something the program has seen perhaps a bit too much of in recent years. And until the Trojans can reach some level of steadiness in the dugout, memories of past glory will continue to drift further into the distance.

College basketball fans have been trained to remain quiet when a home player steps to the free-throw line, allowing the athlete to completely concentrate on making the shot.
Spread the wealth · Senior point guard Jio Fontan has averaged 7.7 assists and just two turnovers per game during the team’s winning streak. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
As senior point guard Jio Fontan stepped to the free-throw line to put the finishing touches on USC’s 71-60 victory over Washington on Sunday, however, the Galen Center crowd of 4,214 instead gave the Trojans (11-13, 6-5 Pac-12) a rousing standing ovation. Junior guard J.T. Terrell waved his arms up and down, drew even louder cheers from the crowd.
“It was a great distraction to have,” Fontan said. “It was fun to hear our fans go crazy after we took care of business.”
Fun is a word that is rapidly becoming associated with the USC basketball program under interim head coach Bob Cantu. The win over Washington gave the Trojans their first three-game win streak of the season, and the team has taken a more relaxed approach as a result.
“We are keeping it pretty light and loose,” Cantu said. “The guys are responding and playing well.”
Whereas the Trojans frequently utilized offensive set plays under former head coach Kevin O’Neill, who was relieved of his duties Jan. 14, Cantu has allowed his team to play in a more up-tempo style, which has increased USC’s scoring output. The Trojans have scored 70 points or more in five of their seven games under Cantu, compared to just four times out of 17 games under O’Neill.
Fontan said practices have lasted longer under Cantu than O’Neill, but the players have more time to work on individual offensive skills.
“Once we understand the game plan,” Fontan said, “Coach Cantu pretty much lets us practice some of the things we want to do in the game offensively, like fast breaks and putting up shots.”
Perhaps the biggest beneficiary of the new style of play has been Terrell. After struggling to find consistent playing time under O’Neill, Terrell has made 2.3 3-pointers per game in conference play, tops in the Pac-12. He has scored in double figures in eight of USC’s last nine games.
“With the freedom we have,” Fontan said, “people are realizing he is one of the best one-one-one scorers in the country.”
USC will begin its weekend series tonight at Stanford. Winners of four of their last five games, the Cardinal (15-9, 6-5) are one of the hottest teams in the conference.
Even more impressive is that Stanford’s average margin of victory in its past four wins is 16.5 points, which includes a 76-52 win over then-No. 10 ranked Oregon.
In its conference opener, USC topped Stanford, 71-69, on Jan. 3 in an extremely close game at the Galen Center. The Trojans took the lead with seven seconds remaining on two clutch free throws from Fontan and were able to survive two missed shot attempts by Stanford in the final seconds to secure the victory.
One area in which Stanford had an advantage over USC was in bench production. The Cardinal bench, led by Andy Brown, who matched his season-high with 17 points off the bench, outscored the Trojans’ subs 43-20. Though disappointed with allowing Stanford’s reserves to score that many points, USC was able to hold guard Chasson Randle, Stanford’s second-leading scorer, scoreless on six field goal attempts.
“We are a very different team,” Cantu said. “They are also different, but we are now more familiar with their personnel.”
The Trojans are 1-9 in their last 10 trips to Maples Pavilion, and Stanford is 10-2 at home this season.
Cal, who USC plays on Sunday, is coming off a 77-69 win over then-No. 7 Arizona. The Golden Bears (14-9, 6-5) are also surging of late, having won three of their last four.
Cal is led by junior guard Allen Crabbe. A product of Price High School in Los Angeles, Crabbe is the reigning Pac-12 player of the week after his 31-point performance in the win over Arizona. In the team’s win over USC on Jan. 5, Crabbe was stellar in scoring a game-high 27 points.
The Trojans will be without redshirt junior forward Ari Stewart, who is expected to miss at least three weeks with a fractured left thumb. Cantu said freshman guard Brendyn Taylor and senior forwards Eric Wise and Renaldo Woolridge could earn more minutes with Stewart sidelined.
Tipoff for Thursday’s game against Stanford is scheduled for 8 p.m. The game will be broadcast on ESPNU.

Though it opened to great fanfare in 2006, the Galen Center has not become the sports hub many thought it would be. Joey Kaufman examines why in this special Daily Trojan report. 
Best-laid plans
The old tale goes like this: USC, when recruiting Aviation High School guard Paul Westphal in the late 1960s, showed the decorated prep standout blueprints of an on-campus arena to be built in time for his senior season in 1972.
But the arena never came, and the promise never was fulfilled by the time Westphal left for the NBA.
So the Trojans’ men’s basketball program stuck the team out at the antiquated Sports Arena in Exposition Park. It would take USC nearly four decades to follow through on that promise of an on-campus arena, but the school eventually did just that in 2006 when it opened the Galen Center, a 10,258-seat facility situated on the edge of USC’s University Park Campus and just a mile south of a suddenly bustling Downtown Los Angeles.
A hub for USC basketball was born, symbolizing the hope that the Trojans, who often played second-fiddle to crosstown rival UCLA, could be more than an afterthought in the city and become a consistent NCAA tournament team.
But roughly six years later, the Galen Center hasn’t exactly represented a new era for the USC men’s basketball team. And in recent months, the program has fought, in spite of the sparkling new digs, to avoid sinking deep into the red and even to stay relevant in an already crowded Southern California sports scene.
 
Maximizing revenue
Recently, USC’s men’s basketball program has ranked near the bottom of the Pac-12 in terms of revenue and profit, according to documents filed with the U.S. Department of Education last October. Though the university is private, it still must file annual reports with the Department of Education as mandated by the Federal Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act. The 1994 law requires coed post-secondary educational institutions that participate in Title IV, such as USC, to disclose athletic participation, expenses, revenues and staffing for their men’s and women’s teams through the yearly reports.
For the 2011-12 academic report, USC reported $4.81 million in revenue for men’s basketball, pitting it just ninth among Pac-12 schools.
“Would we hope [basketball] drove additional revenues? The answer would be yes,” said Steve Lopes, USC senior associate athletic director and chief financial officer for the athletic department. “That’s why we have to do well in that sport because it has the potential to drive revenue.”
Moreover, USC’s expenses ($4.85 million) for men’s basketball surpassed its revenue, making it one of just three Pac-12 schools to post a loss. The school’s 2010-11 report showed an even larger disparity between expenses ($4.18 million) and revenue ($3.72 million). By those calculations, the men’s basketball program fails to generate a profit by itself.
Though USC’s revenue from men’s basketball has averaged about $4 million according to the university’s last two reports filed, the program’s expenses stand higher than those of its Pac-12 counterparts, which reported similar men’s basketball revenue figures. Oregon State and Washington State reported $5.49 million and $4.59 million in revenue for men’s basketball in 2011-12, respectively, but posted expenses more than $1 million less than USC.
Expenses are primarily composed of coaches’ salaries, scholarship aid, travel fees and other maintenance costs. Former USC head coach Kevin O’Neill, who was fired mid-January, was among the conference’s highest-paid coaches, receiving $1.7 million in total compensation in 2010-11, according to the school’s most recent federal tax returns.
But Lopes, in spite of the challenges the program faces and the chance of it sinking further into the red, remains optimistic. He describes the current outlook for men’s basketball as “positive,” citing the fact it more or less covers its expenses — making it the only sport at USC other than football to do so.
“Look, the revenues are down,” he said. “If you look at the arena, you know it’s not very full. But there is still a lot of potential in men’s basketball for us in terms of revenue.”
Call it a glass half full.
Though revenue from men’s basketball is lower than administrators might hope, USC still posted a record $84 million in athletics-related revenue for 2011-12, with $25.8 million coming in non-allocated revenue. Lopes said most athletics-related donations aren’t given to individual sports, but to the department as a whole, typically through the four primary support groups: Cardinal and Gold, Women of Troy, The Committee and the Scholarship Club. This largely comprises the non-allocated revenue figure. Alumni are presented with the option to donate to football or men’s basketball exclusively, but the preference is usually to donate to the department itself.
Thus, most team-specific revenue is generated by ticket sales, which for men’s basketball remains increasingly problematic.
Declining attendance 
In recent years, USC’s drop in on-the-court production has perhaps been most reflected by the growing number of empty seats at the Galen Center.
Since the 2007-08 season — O.J. Mayo’s lone season with the program — attendance has been on a steady decline. That year, an average of 8,468 fans made their way to the Galen Center per game. But the next season, with Mayo in the NBA, average attendance dropped by 34 percent; by the 2009-10 season, the slide continued: 5,011 per contest.
Since then, nothing has changed to halt the drop in attendance, not even an NCAA tournament appearance in 2010-11, a season in which the school averaged another record low for arena attendance with a meager figure of 4,691.
Not to be outdone, the 2011-12 Trojans, amid a record 26-loss season, eclipsed that dubious attendance mark too, averaging 3,970 fans per game — less than 40 percent capacity for the then-five-year-old arena.
And attendance this season through 13 games has hardly changed, as USC has averaged 3,973 fans per contest.
“It kind of comes with the situation,” said USC interim head coach Bob Cantu, who replaced O’Neill in mid-January. “When you’re not winning, not as many people come out. That’s just the truth.”
Though USC made the NCAA tournament in each of the building’s first three seasons, the team’s recent struggles have been woeful. Since the 2011 Pac-10 tournament, it’s record is 17-40. And as a result, fewer and fewer Angelenos have flooded the facility.
“The Galen Center is fantastic,” said former sports business consultant David Carter, now a professor in the Marshall School of Business, “but people usually don’t show up to see a building. They show up to see the content.”
And that content, particularly the Trojans’ style of play, has hardly helped.
According to ESPN Stats & Info, over a span of 113 games under O’Neill, USC ranked last in points per game among teams from the ‘Power Six’ conferences, which include the ACC, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC. The former NBA coach preached defense, defense and more defense in addition to a tough, grind-it-out style on offense that proved useful in notable upset wins over    No. 9 Tennessee in December 2009 and No. 19 Texas in December 2010.
But that style failed to create a buzz among locals, alumni and students alike.
“You know, we just dreaded watching the games because there was no excitement on offense,” said Alejandro Madrid, a senior majoring in accounting and a men’s basketball play-by-play broadcaster for KXSC, USC’s student radio station.
Cantu, who worked as an assistant under former USC coaches Henry Bibby, Jim Saia and Tim Floyd, has tweaked that defense-intensive formula, pushing for a more up-tempo brand of basketball.
“We’re playing with a little more exciting style of play,” Cantu said. “We’re pushing it a little bit more. We’re playing with a little more freedom. If we can get some wins, more fans will be interested in what we’re doing and come out.”
Under Cantu, the Trojans have averaged 72 points per game, a jump from the 63.8 mark during the first 17 games of the season under O’Neill.
It’s been an attempt, foremost, to get players to be more “loose” on the court, Cantu said. But coincidentally, it’s also a style of play that can often get more people in the arena and resonate with fans.
But beyond an up-tempo pace, the most powerful, if not the only, remedy for USC to fill more seats at the Galen Center is to win.
“When you play in a pro city like L.A. or New York, in order to get that fan base in, you have to get consistent winning,” said senior guard Jio Fontan, who transferred from Fordham University in January 2010. “The football team consistently wins, and that’s why they get the crowds. You can’t take it personally. You just have to do your job. The better you do, the more support you’ll get.”
USC has won in men’s basketball in recent years, but it’s struggled to do so consistently. Yes, the program has made the NCAA tournament four times in the last six seasons, but it hasn’t been enough to create a lasting spark.
In the two seasons the Trojans missed out on the postseason, they weren’t competitive. In 2012, they lost a school-record 26 times, winning just once over the final three months of the season. And even despite finishing 16-14 and sweeping UCLA in 2010, the team was amid a one-year, self-imposed postseason ban, essentially rendering much of conference play meaningless. Predictably, fan interest suffered as a result.
Unlike the Trojans’ football program, which holds claim to 11 national championships, men’s basketball lacks the luxury of relying on tradition when the wins don’t pile up. It has never won an NCAA championship and hasn’t been to a Final Four since 1954. So, as of late, when USC doesn’t win in men’s basketball, there is little to fall back on.
Sports as a destination
Because of USC’s location within Los Angeles, it also faces the challenge of carving out a niche. The city features two professional basketball teams, two professional baseball teams, two professional hockey teams, two professional soccer teams and arguably the most decorated college basketball program in UCLA. That’s a lot for a fledgling program to compete with, not to mention college football’s rising popularity nationwide.
“This is a hard market to make a splash in,” Carter said. “Southern California is used to winners. USC is used to winners. Not having a competitive team and a star is a problem.”
Comparatively, the Staples Center, the city’s main basketball and hockey venue that opened in 1999, is situated at L.A. Live and is surrounded by dozens of restaurants and various attractions within one block. Fans are presented with more dining and entertainment options than at an on-campus arena such as the Galen Center. And in Los Angeles, often referred to as the entertainment capital of the world, a lack of such options can become problematic.
So an alternative for USC, to combat sustained losses, could be to make the facility a “destination,” according to Carter.
“If you’re not winning, the way you drive attendance to Galen for basketball games is to continue to try making it a destination for the students from which they then go out to parties, to dinner and to dates,” Carter said. “Use that as focal point.”
Though it pales in comparison to the Staples Center as an entertainment venue within Los Angeles, the Galen Center has been used as of late for other purposes than sports. In 2012, the rapper Drake held a concert at the arena, and so did the rock band The Fray in 2009. The Galen Center also housed the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards the last two years, signaling the arena could be used for other purposes beyond USC’s athletic teams.
What’s next?
Upcoming on the agenda for USC is to hire its next men’s basketball coach, a ritual that now has to be performed for the third time since the Galen Center opened. Potentially, it could remove the interim tag from Cantu, who has led the team to a 4-3 mark since taking over, and retain the coach who has spent the last 12 seasons with the program. Or, it could hire someone from the outside, seemingly to provide a jolt for a program often labeled a “sleeping giant.”
The hope, naturally, stands to again try to turn the Trojans’ program into a consistent NCAA tournament team, much like it became for a brief period of time under Floyd, who led the team to three straight tournament appearances for the first and only time in school history from 2007-09.
Many insist that a stronger foundation is in order.
“In the last 10 years, they’ve had some really good teams,” ESPN college basketball analyst Jay Bilas told the Los Angeles Times in January. “But I don’t think people have looked upon it as having a program.”
Others remain baffled. How could USC, with a shiny new on-campus arena within a metropolis such as Los Angeles and history of success — nearly 100 NCAA championships in all sports — be so inconsistent on the hardwood?
“It’s got all the resources,” said former USC forward David Blu, a member of the Trojans’ 2000-01 team, which made the Elite Eight. “It’s got the Galen Center. It’s got uniforms. It’s got all the athletic equipment you need. It’s got the weight room. It’s got the shooting machine. It’s got all the managers you need. It’s got training tables. It’s got everything an athlete needs to be at the top of his game. So for me, USC should be a postseason school every year.”
To figure out how the Galen Center can become a thriving, profitable hub for the university, perhaps this is the moment to recite the time-old question: Can USC win, and win consistently, in men’s basketball?

Teenagers, an independent French film directed by Paul Verhoeven, has earned impressive awards from film festivals all over the world while also drawing harsh criticism from others. It would be easy to envision where the criticisms come from but extremely unclear how a film of this quality earned any award anywhere.
Paul Verhoeven is an established Hollywood heavyweight director and producer. With hits like Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers, Total Recall and Robocop, the Verhoeven name has a dedicated following of moviegoers ready to suspend their disbelief and settle in for an action packed adventure. It is safe to say that Verhoeven is an expert at his craft.
But, the mastermind behind Total Recall has a cousin who shares the same name. He too is a filmmaker, but his resume is not as impressive. Teenagers is his first film and after 5 minutes at the Arena Cinema it was clear that the two Pauls have a very different skill set.
The film opens up in 1983 with a 12 year old boy named Lucas keeping company to Erwan, 15. Erwan’s parents set out on a journey that left Erwan to fend for himself, leaving him bitter and resentful. He deflects his bitterness onto a vulnerable Lucas who is prepared to accept harsh treatment in hopes that it would make Erwan happy again. Erwan takes advantage of his power and almost kills his humble follower. Seeing what he has done, Erwan develops an emotional attachment to Lucas, but runs away in fear that Lucas might grow up to be like him.
The film fast-forwards to Lucas as a courageous young adult. A 14 year old boy named Said is sent by a terrorist organization to kill Lucas for writing a song opposing the terrorists actions. When Said meets Lucas, he is captivated by his preachings of love and acceptance. Desperately in need of a nurturing relationship, Said creates a bond with his target. As a result, Said becomes the next target of the terrorists.
Lucas’ influence carries on to a new protagonist, Alexis, 15. Alexis sees Lucas’ inspiration as almost Christ-like and begins to relay his words onto others. He is able to offer Lucas’ words to another teen, Brieuc, who is on the verge of committing suicide. Brieuc refrains from doing so and Lucas’ influence proves to be a lasting, positive mark on the lives of everyone in the movie.
Based solely on the plot, the film has potential to be worthwhile. With a strong lead, quality directing and a decent production crew, Teenagers could be an independent film ripe for distribution. Unfortunately, this movie missed on every essential aspect required of being called watchable.
The film appears to have had nearly no budget. Each setting seems to have been either the home of someone involved with the movie or in a random location in the woods. The actors apparently have no experience and are forced to shove their awkward dramatics in each other’s faces each minute of the 2 and a half hour film. The acting implies that the shooting of this film was as painful to experience as it was to watch. A minimal budget and poor acting could be expected of an independent film, but even the film transitions were cheesy and distracting from an already weak plot.
A common aspect among successful low budget indie films is that they tend not to overreach. This film needed to stick to a central subject and put all its effort into achieving its main goal. Verhoeven thought he could get away with more than his budget would allow.  In believing so, he created a strange film that left me embarrassed and uncomfortable.
Teenagers is all over the place. The film touches on bullying, dependence, terrorists, sexuality, homophobia and suicide, amongst other dramatic themes. None of these issues are handled properly. The film hits a true low point when the film’s protagonist, Lucas, creates a loving bond with his intended killer. Although Lucas is not murdered, the believability of the film certainly is.
Attempting to address a theme as delicate as teenage sexuality is gutsy. Very few films have tackled the subject in a tasteful manner. Although Verhoeven makes a valiant effort, Teenagers is way off the mark with its attempt at turning an awkward subject into art. At this point in the movie, viewers are likely to want to remove themselves from the theatre and forget about what was just witnessed.
Teenagers has earned its share of accolades at various film festivals around the world, likely due to the attention to anti-suicide in teens. If this was the intended objective, then I would say good job to the cast and crew. This is a film for kids and should be advertised as such.

No Valentine’s Day would be complete without sweet love songs to set the mood for a day to be spent with that special someone. From Marvin Gaye’s soulful crooning to The Cure’s brand of bittersweet rock, this playlist covers every V-Day occasion and every relationship status. For those who are spending this Valentine’s Day single, never fear, there are a couple songs included for celebrating singlehood too.
Crushing on someone and finally ready to ask him or her out? The tried and true “Call Me Maybe” by Carly Rae Jepson is a good choice, or take a risk and surprise your crushee with Death Cab for Cutie’s “I Will Possess Your Heart.” The song ensures success, because not only do the lyrics explicitly say “you got to spend some time with me,” but the band and the song immediately recall ’90s nostalgia — an instant heart-softener, preventing any chance of a “no.”
Just started dating and headed together to a party? Ask the DJ to play “Rock Your Body” by Justin Timberlake (the original or a dubstep remix!). With its danceable beat and super-sexy lyrics, it can be a vehicle to express your attraction to one another. If you can’t dance, do it anyway. No matter how silly the moves, having fun with each other is the first step to building any relationship.
Got a daytime date planned at Six Flags or the Santa Monica pier? Blast The Cure’s “Just Like Heaven” on the drive there to get those warm fuzzies going. The song describes a budding love between two free spirits — that is, before the girl disappears. OK, the lyrics are bittersweet — but the beat is lively and Robert Smith’s vocals are lilting, the perfect combination for a day of thrills. Roll down the windows and ignore the traffic as you shout along that your love is “just like a dream!”
Ready to make it serious? “Wild Horses” by the Rolling Stones is easily one of the sweetest songs in all of classic rock and would be a perfect choice to serenade a loved one with, accompanied by an acoustic guitar. A little corny, yes, but Valentine’s Day is the time to be lovably corny. Plus, the chords and lyrics are easy enough to learn and the declaration that “wild horses couldn’t keep me away” is guaranteed to melt the listener’s heart.
Looking for the perfect song to complement candles, roses and a home-cooked dinner? Bust out that iHome and play the sexy and soulful tracks “I’ll Make Love To You” by Boyz II Men and “Let’s Get It On” by the late, great Marvin Gaye. Frankly, the titles say it all. Moving on.
Need a song for cuddling to? No song does the job better than the aptly named, “Never Gonna Leave This Bed” by Maroon 5. Old Maroon 5 songs all serve as great love songs, but this particular one takes the cake, as it is literally about staying in bed and figuratively about never leaving a relationship. And as Adam Levine’s voice soars, it wouldn’t be a terrible idea to whisper along to the lyrics, because “take it, take it all, take all that I have” sounds pretty romantic, right?
Single? Sure, watching The Notebook and crying into a pint of Ben & Jerry’s can be therapeutic, but it’s not worth waking up the next morning bloated with puffy eyes while everyone else is practically glowing with leftover Valentine’s Day cheer. Try having a singles’ party instead, where you might even find a potential someone. Or, if that sounds too sad, just hang out with your best, single friends, and as Park and Recreation’s Tom Haverford would say, “treat yo’self!” Whether that entails a concert, a spa trip or snowboarding, these are the songs to jam out to.
Girl’s day out? Recently anointed the urban girls’ anthem by the television show Girls on HBO, Robyn’s “Dancing On My Own” has a pulsing beat and only mildly sad lyrics. So, you can wallow a little, but then proceed to pick yourself up, have an impromptu dance-along and celebrate “Galentine’s” with your single girlfriends and maybe a little retail therapy.
Doing some bro bonding? Jason Derülo certainly isn’t worked up about, being alone as he announces in “Ridin Solo.” Take a page from Derulo’s book and work on your “shine” instead. Take a trip to Mammoth, go see a horror flick at LA Live, trade workout secrets or discuss the merits of Mila Kunis — the options are endless.
Want to have a singles’ party? “Young, Wild and Free” by Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa is an instant crowd-pleaser and suggests embracing being single, because it is the equivalent to being young, wild and free. Why not?
Whatever your plans this Valentine’s Day, these songs will set the mood — be it romantic or apathetic — and impress your date or your friends with their appropriateness. Happy Valentine’s Day!

Every Valentine’s Day, there are millions of couples who choose to share their love. Chocolates, gifts, movies, dinner — the world is their oyster.
For one day, it is OK to be so romantic that your mouth hurts. For one day, no one can give you ire for holding hands or making kissy faces toward your significant other.
But what about the rest of the world? Just as there are millions of couples showcasing their love to the world, there are millions of singles who realize that Feb. 14 is just another day on the calendar.
The movies always show the same thing: A depressed woman staring at Titanic playing on the screen, comfort food and perhaps a bottle of wine lying next to her. Then there’s the hackneyed image of the boy who has his heart broken and goes on his quest to prove his love.
But this is not reality. Though there are some who wish to finally have a beau before next Valentine’s Day, there are also those, who frankly, don’t give a damn. Sure, Valentine’s Day is a day to spend with your lover, but your lover could be anyone. One could be celebrating the day with a friend, with a parent or with oneself. It’s important to realize that love has no boundaries, and everyone can have a little fun on Valentine’s Day.
So do you find yourself single but wanting to have fun on V-Day? Are you sick of sitting at home wishing upon a star for that significant other to walk in? Suit up,  friends, and check out this compilation of the best things to do tonight.
1. Take advantage of those sales. Plenty of places have “packages” for couples on this holiday. Grab a buddy and hit up The Grove for a dinner-and-a-movie combo. Then, play a game in which you guess how long the couples around you have been together and how soon they will break up. The price of the package will probably fit right in your budget and you get a fun date night where nothing is expected — and you don’t even have to look attractive. If you’re not in a sensitive place, then go see a terrible rom-com and make fun of all the ridiculousness of the plot.
2. Head out for a night on the town. Whether you go to the Row, The 901 Bar & Grill or a bar downtown, such as Library Bar, hit up Los Angeles for a night of debauchery. Nothing is better than having a good time with a group of friends, but try spicing it up a little. Wear a ridiculous outfit or give yourself a hilarious new identity. You can even make a game out of it: Compete with your friends on the grounds of who can talk to the most strangers. The first one to break character buys a round of drinks.
3. Keep it low-key. Host a bad movie night at your place. On the list should be classics such as The Room, The Prince & Me, From Justin to Kelly, The Lizzie McGuire Movie and every Mary-Kate and Ashley movie in existence. By making fun of everyone who had any part in these films, you will automatically feel better about yourself. This is the only kind of bullying that’s OK.
4. Do something that you’ve never done before. Have you always wanted to hike to the Hollywood sign? Perhaps you’ve never been to the Santa Monica Pier. Tonight is your chance to expand your horizons a bit and explore Los Angeles. Treat Valentine’s Day as a day of renewal, as a day of turning the focus to yourself and doing what you want to do.
5. Bonfire. This might be a bit extreme, but burning everything that reminds you of an ex or unrequited crush can be quite cathartic. It might just be what you need this Valentine’s Day.
Whatever you choose to do, just remember that though love itself is great, Valentine’s Day is severely overrated. It’s just one day and it’ll eventually pass. Every now and then, we’re all entitled to be a bit selfish, so use Feb. 14 as a day to celebrate being yourself — it’s the most important relationship you have.
Whoaaa easy on the Lizzie McGuire movie, please! Right in the feels!

The romance genre currently faces a bit of a conundrum. Mass-market paperbacks offer readers “sweeping tales of love,” but their covers often flaunt top-heavy women curled up on four-poster beds. Colorful hardbacks boast moonlit silhouettes of shirtless men crouching in bedroom windows but still promise “genuine romance.”
This, scream the Fabio-inspired illustrations, is the 21st-century love story.
Romance novels tend to blend the emotional with the physical, the passionate with the sexual, all for the sake of a good love story. But few novels intimately discuss what love is. Whether you’re reading the likes of Nora Roberts or Lisa Kleypas, romantic heroes and heroines often base their emotional attachment on their bedroom activities. And the higher the sexual tension, the stronger the so-called “love story.”
That’s not to say that sex doesn’t belong in literature. Whatever your opinions on the Fifty Shades trilogy, E.L. James’ series shot to the top of The New York Times Bestseller charts, and Anne Rice’s The Sleeping Beauty trilogy has recently seen a mass reprinting, suggesting that sex is just as commercial on the page as it is on-screen.
But why do authors and readers seem to confuse sensual passions with profound love? Steamy page turners and erotic novels certainly have their time and place and sex scenes can, if warranted, illustrate a larger emotional connection between characters. But why is it that today’s love stories are interrupted with premature descriptions of “flames fueled by nothing more than his mouth and tongue” or “ovarian wine” before characters know their lovers’ last names?  (Thank you, Linda Howard.)
The love story hasn’t always been so sexually driven. Book lovers constantly return to Mr. Darcy’s declarations of love in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice or the relatable characters of Erich Segal’s Love Story; William Goldman’s The Princess Bride enchants with the hilarious escapades of Westley and Buttercup while Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s Love in the Time of Cholera captivates readers throughout its characters’ prolonged romance.
It seems as though modern romance, however, takes a more formulaic trend. Even if some authors don’t decorate their chapters with emotionless sex scenes, standard romance novels tend to lack the plot and character depth necessary for a moving love story. Nicholas Sparks, whose novel Safe Haven inspired a film set for a Valentine’s Day release, currently holds a title as one of the most popular names in romance — but perhaps undeservedly so. He might have initially charmed with The Notebook and A Walk to Remember, but his latest works regurgitate tired concepts and shallow lead protagonists — if I only had a dollar for every character who gets cancer in one of his novels.
Perhaps the closest we’ve recently come to an innovative love story is Isaac Marion’s Warm Bodies, which also saw a recent theatrical release. Marion’s love story merges the fantastical with the romantic, telling the story of a self-seeking zombie named “R” and his newfound love interest, Julie. With modern civilization on the brink of destruction because of a mysterious zombie virus, R struggles to reclaim his identity in a world where love, conversation and even literacy no longer exist — that is, until he begins to fall for Julie.
As two protagonists redefine their humanity, Marion clarifies that this is not a story about sex. Only genuine love, he argues, will save the human race.
“I won’t deny that this proximity ignites more urges in me than the instinct to kill or eat,” says R, as he lies next to Julie in the bed of an abandoned suburban home. “But although these new urges are there … all I really want to do is lie next to her. In this moment, the most I’d ever hope for would be for her to lay her head on my chest, let out a warm, contented breath, and sleep.”
Though his scene certainly has sexual undertones — even the mention of the word “bedroom” can provoke dirty thoughts from the most conservative reader — Marion understands the need to develop his character’s relationship without the added pressure of sexual activity. As a result, his characters grow attached to each other in a way that is emotionally believable, if somewhat fantastical.
Of course, Marion’s Warm Bodies isn’t the only satisfying contemporary love story. Audrey Niffenger’s The Time Traveler’s Wife met rave reviews from critics and readers alike for its stunning discussions of absence and free will. David Nicholls’ One Day successfully develops a relationship by describing the events of a single date — July 15 — over the span of 20 years. And even Danielle Steel, who’s dominated the romance genre for over three decades, has released the intriguing Until the End of Time, which follows two unlikely romances over two different eras.
Still, with so much of the romantic market drowned out by depthless sex scenes or cookie-cutter heroines, it’s difficult to find a love story that captures human sexuality and emotional capacity, which is disappointing. Love intrigues us. We constantly turn back to stories that explore fictional relationships that might mirror our own private experiences — perhaps even to find a way to express love in our own lives. And though sex does form a component of romance, it should ultimately represent two characters coming together for something greater.
“I crush her against me,” says Perry, Julie’s former lover in Warm Bodies. “I want to be part of her. Not just inside her but all around her. I want our rib cages to crack open and our hearts to migrate and merge. I want our cells to braid together like living thread.”
Today’s romantic tales should follow a similar philosophy. Braiding desire, affection and vulnerability into something living: Love.

That may have been true of past romance novels but there are too many choices in today’s market. A wimpy heroine would not score high with romance readers. The one good thing about small presses, epub and NY publisher’s digital lines is the availability of different romance content. There is something for everyone just about.

Los Angeles boasts tons of hidden attractions, so it’s no wonder that, on Valentine’s Day, tons of couples will venture into the city for their amorous celebrations.

That means you have plenty of opportunities to sweep a new crush off their feet or share a special evening with that certain someone. This year, take your beau somewhere new or take advantage of special V-Day deals for a fantastic evening. Whether you drive a car or want to stay in the area, the city offers plenty for adventurous lovebirds.
Bacaro LA Wine Bar 
You don’t need to travel far away to settle down to a romantic dinner with your boo. Simply walk over to Bacaro LA for a cozy, dimly-lit dinner where you can share intimate conversation with your one and only. The restaurant boasts a significant wine selection and scrumptious eats. Lucky for you, the restaurant offers a special Valentine’s Day deal — $35 for a three-course dinner. This prix fixe menu includes dishes such as poached shrimp, seared scallops and even 24-carat gold leaf German chocolate cake. Bacaro LA is located on 2308 S. Union Ave.
Perch LA
Downtown Los Angeles offers plenty of trendy, fancy eateries, but one of the most romantic settings in the area lies on a rooftop. Perch LA offers fancy French eats and delicious wine paired with a view of Pershing Square and the surrounding downtown skyline. The quaint restaurant includes an indoor seating area as well, but the outdoor experience lets you snuggle up against your date in front of a small fireplace. Most nights also includes a DJ or live act, so you can enjoy smooth tunes with the crisp night air. Perch LA is located on 448 S. Hill St.
LACMA
For a less typical date, head to Los Angeles’ premier art museum for a night of romance with an artsy twist. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art offers several options for interested couples. For $30, visitors can fall in love with the museum’s pieces and enjoy a Love Hurts tour that leads groups through pieces about less-than-ideal love situations. For $30 more, you can enjoy that and a pop-up dinner. Not to mention the opportunity to take tons of cute photos near “Levitated Mass,” the giant rock you can walk under, and “Urban Lights,” the postcard-perfect, outdoor piece Angelenos always snap pictures with. LACMA is located on 5905 Wilshire Blvd.
Los Angeles Arboretum & Botanic Garden
If you’re willing to take the extra step for your special someone and drive a little farther, the effort pays off if you venture into the Los Angeles Arboretum & Botanic Garden. With 127 acres of nature to stroll through, the grounds of the Arboretum hold many surprises — among them peacocks that casually wander around you. Many exotic plants dot the large area and if you catch the peacocks at the right time, you can even witness their unique courting process. Tickets go for only $8 and the Arboretum opens its doors from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Los Angeles Arboretum & Botanic Garden is located on 301 N. Baldwin Ave. in Arcadia.
The Cinefamily’s Silent Movie Theatre
It might seem strange that Los Angeles would still house a place related to silent movies, but the Silent Movie Theatre actually exists, playing both silent movies and talkies. For film-loving couples, the theater offers a couple of interesting features on Valentine’s Day. At 7:30 p.m. you can sit back and watch the classic Casablanca, or show up a little later at 10 p.m. for something more risque — a montage of clips dubbed “Cinefamily’s Most Outrageous F-cks 2013!” If you can’t make it on Valentine’s but like the idea of taking your significant other to this unique theatre, check cinefamily.org for a calendar of events. The Silent Movie Theatre is located on 611 N. Fairfax Ave.
Downtown LA Art Walk
Looking for something free? Search no further than the Downtown LA Art Walk, which happens to take place on Valentine’s Day this month. Explore the area’s many galleries —most of which offer free wine or beer -— and discover your new favorite artists alongside your valentine. To start off the night, head over to the Art Walk Lounge at 6 p.m. for bread samples from the Eureka Baking Company and a look at some work from Iranian photographer Sia Aryai. Pick up a map there or download the app for a more high-tech directory. If the night turns chilly, get warm inside one of the many bars nearby. Of special note is Bar 107, which features ’80s music and old-school video games in the back. Art Walk Lounge is located on 634 S. Spring St. in Los Angeles.
Alcove Café and Bakery
Surrounded by a string of restaurants, Alcove Café and Bakery might prove hard to see at first, but it’s cute, vintage interior and relaxed atmosphere make it a rare gem. For this Valentine’s Day, the restaurant holds a completely free, no-reservations-needed event entitled “Bollywood Prom.” The event, which runs from 6 p.m. to midnight, includes everything from a gin and tonic bar to a henna artist to Bollywood music. You can nominate yourself and your boo for king and queen (or king and king or queen and queen) at the restaurant or on Facebook for a special crowning that night. If you miss out on the event, the restaurant still warrants a visit for its phenomenal brunch, scrumptious desserts and delicious drinks. Alcove Café and Bakery is located  on Hillhurst Ave. in Los Angeles.
 
From restaurants to attractions, the city offers plenty of opportunities to sweep your sweetheart off his or her feet. Trade the obvious options for more intriguing ones and explore the city in search of something new — you might find love along the way.

German-born, 85-year-old Pope Benedict XVI will be the first pope to voluntarily resign since Pope Celestine V in 1294 and the first to leave the papal office while still alive since Pope Gregory XII. Elected April 19, 2005, Benedict announced his resignation on Monday, and it will take effect on Feb. 28 — after almost eight years as pope.
Considered the leader of nearly 1.2 billion souls and named number five on Forbes’ Most Powerful People list, the pope is obviously an important man and his resignation is obviously a noteworthy event. Throughout history, very few popes have resigned, setting the tradition of a pope’s reign to be from election until death.
In 2010, Benedict wrote that he would resign if he felt himself not able to “physically, psychologically and spiritually” run the church.
“Strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me,” he said in his statement.
The pontiff’s main reason for departure is ill health, but it is quite possible that the reason could be connected to the scandals that developed during his term. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the pope’s decision should be respected in “an age where life expectancy is longer than ever, and many people will understand that even the pope has to come to terms with the burdens of ageing.”
Counting back to the year 1295, Pope Benedict XVI is on record as the fifth-oldest Pope at age of election at the age of 78 years and 3 days.
Nonetheless, his resignation will hopefully bring the election of a younger pontiff who can hopefully foster the needed growth in church attendance, as well as usher in better public relations for the Church.
And though the Church’s main concern should be growing said attendance, the scandals of the pope’s term likely got in the way. The Roman Catholic Church had a terrible year in 2009 because of missteps in speeches, poor international relations, declining public image and criticism for undoing some reforms that had modernized the church. A Roman Catholic Church insider then described his 4-year-old papacy as “a disaster . . . He’s out of touch with the real world. On the condom issue, for example, there are priests . . . in Africa who accept that condoms are a key part of the fight against AIDS, and yet the pope adheres to this very conservative line that they encourage promiscuity. The Vatican is far removed from the reality on the ground.”
Though it is said one gets wiser with age, it seems as if age has hindered the pope’s ability to make decisions in this rapidly changing world. It seems as if a new sex abuse scandal rocks the Church too often. And though the pope attempted to handle it to the best of his ability, stronger action is necessary. In 2010, Pope Benedict XVI released a statement saying that abusive priests had “disfigured their ministry” and brought “profound shame and regret on the church.” And though he issued new rules aimed at stopping abuse, it is imperative to note the Roman Catholic Church’s historical tendecy to cover up scandals instead of dealing with them.
The pope’s decision might even set a beneficial precedent, one in which future popes are encouraged to resign when their health deteriorates, thus ending the 600-year-old tradition of serving until death.
Benedict set up a YouTube channel, Twitter account and Facebook app, and he saw the environmental improvement of the Vatican City, but the church must continue to adapt to technological and societal changes. The Vatileaks scandal — the pontiff’s butler leaking documents alleging corruption in the Church’s business dealings — caused international furor. Yet, this shows that the world of media will not wait for the Vatican to slowly release information and the papacy must stay ahead of the curve in communication.
In one attempt to adapt to the times, the Pope made cleaning up the Vatican’s reputation for getting shady money one of his priorities, beefing up the city-state’s laws and hiring a top Swiss financial fighter to raise standards to international levels. But this still needs work and his resignation could leave this effort in limbo.
The pope’s resignation illustrates his maturity and willingness to take responsibility, allowing a more vivacious cardinal take the reins from here on out. One can only hope that the next pope will attempt to modernize the church and work with modernity — not fight it.

Are you kidding me? You think a new pope would change the policy on condoms?
The policies of the Catholic church inherent to the core values of the faith are not going to change. This isn’t like electing some president where such issues are up for debate. The issues are what they are.
Please educate yourself. Please.
I am an ex-Catholic turned atheist and one of the troubling aspects of ‘precedent’ that comes to mind when looking for related info on this story is that every search engine provided DT link is broken dealing with Father William Messenger and that the DT search comes up completely empty as well. It highlights a completely untenable situation when uncomfortable facts go down the memory hole.

Removing more than half of America’s troops from Afghanistan will allow the government to focus on other matters.
Robert Calcagno | Daily Trojan
 
The first problem with the United States’ engagement in Afghanistan is that the war is making the situation worse. The goal of the war was originally to disable al-Qaida, but the goal has since become to stop the Taliban insurgency and create a stable and independent Afghan government. To accomplish this goal, the U.S. military has made it a priority to eradicate Taliban insurgents and an attempt to make Afghanistan self-sufficient.
The American invasion, however, has led to an increase in the number of Taliban fighters. From 2001-11, Taliban fighter numbers increased from 200 to 30,000, according to The New York Times. As Australian counter-insurgency expert David Kilcullen explained, this is largely because U.S. involvement is so overbearing that many moderate Afghan civilians move to an extremist position as their friends are killed or their neighborhoods are destroyed. An American presence, it appears, is the single greatest recruitment tool for the Taliban. Pulling out now eliminates the motivation to fight for more moderate Afghan civilians and Taliban insurgents.
Undoubtedly, extremist and fundamentalist Taliban fighters will continue to fight the Afghan government for control of the country. However, the Afghan government, the United States and the world will benefit more from withdrawal than from continued engagement.
The next reason to withdraw is because even if United States troops remain in Afghanistan, the United States cannot win the war. Since taking office, Obama has not pledged enough troops to the fight in Afghanistan; his predecessor, President George W. Bush, did not send enough troops during his time in office, either. The current levels of troops are too low for the United States to effectively fight the Taliban, provide security for civilian populations, train replacement Afghan troops and help rebuild infrastructure.
Consequently, U.S. action in these matters is ineffective at best and harmful at worst. The best the U.S. military can do now is to leave the situation. It’s arguable that the U.S. had created a worse situation in Afghanistan than before the war. Nevertheless, continued involvement will do more harm than good in Afghanistan.
Finally, the goal of fighting terrorism is best achieved by focusing attention elsewhere. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, in a speech given on campus last fall, posited that terrorist threats now come from unorganized states. Afghanistan is unstable but far more stable than some other failing states.
If the U.S. government wants to stop terrorism, it should turn its efforts toward aiding fragile and failing states. The government has already taken steps in this direction by helping to stabilize Libya and Egypt after the overthrow of leaders Moammar Gaddafi and Hosni Mubarak, respectively. The United States needs to expand these policies, and reallocating resources from Afghanistan to other sensitive areas is sensible policy.
Dan Morgan-Russell is a freshman majoring in international relations.
 
The U.S. should wait until Afghanistan is ready to fight terrorism without international aid.
If the embassy attacks in Egypt and Istanbul are any indication, terrorism and anti-American sentiment are coming to a head. Now is the time that the military shows its strength, not the time it backs away. It would be cowardly to remove ourselves from the situation before the safety and welfare of our citizens is assured.
One only needs to look at the disaster known as the Vietnam War for evidence. Retreating with its tail between its legs, the U.S. military became a laughingstock of the world, one that went down in the record books. It is still possible to “fix” Afghanistan, but it requires more work, something that the United States seems incapable of. Instead of giving up, the country needs to put in the effort to fix the problems that it largely started. The American presence in Afghanistan antagonized many, and though it’s nice to think that everything will be OK by simply leaving, it’s naïve to think that’s the case.
It is also imperative to mention the fact that Afghanistan is in no way ready to take control of their military. Still a relatively new democracy, the country still deals with the raging lunacy of the Taliban. By leaving the country, the United States is basically inviting the Taliban back in. The American military provides a sense of security for Afghanistan. This security can back down only when there is an adequate military ready to take its place — and Afghan forces just won’t cut it.
Americans want their troops home, but they need to comprehend what they would be leaving: a country barely holding itself together, a country ruined by their acts, a country that still needs a helping hand.
Yes, the United States has its own problems, but it is time that we show the world that we don’t give up, and we take accountability for our actions.

‘The only religion I respect is Islam. The only prophet I admire is the Prophet Muhammad.’ — Adolf Hitler
In May 1786, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, then serving as American ambassadors to France and Britain respectively, met with Tripoli’s ambassador to London, Sidi Haji Abdul Rahman Adja. During their discussions, they questioned Ambassador Adja as to the source of the unprovoked animus directed at the infant US republic. As Adams and Jefferson later reported to the Continental Congress, the ambassador said the raids were a jihad against infidels. Adja was reported to have said:
“ … that it was founded on the Laws of their Prophet, that it was written in their Koran, that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were sinners, that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all they could take as Prisoners, and that every Musselman (Muslim) who should be slain in Battle was sure to go to Paradise. ”
To quote the scholar Andrew Bostom, “an aggressive jihad was already being waged against the United States almost 200 years prior to America becoming a dominant international power in the Middle East.

EXCLUSIVE: After deliberations that began at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday and concluded around 3:30 a.m. Wednesday, the Undergraduate Student Government Elections Commission determined both presidential tickets had committed violations of the elections code.
Matt Arkfeld and Alex Cascante were cited for not using the “Vote On” logo on their campaign shirts, the Elections and Recruitment Committee wrote in their decision. USG Election Code Article VII Section D 2 stipulates that all candidates are required to display a “Vote On” logo on their campaign shirts.
They were also cited for violating Election Code Article VI Sections A, B and C for distributing campaign photographs online during the research period, which is prior to Feb. 4 at midnight, when campaigning begins.
Christian Kurth and Ryan Park were cited for violating Article II Section A3 and Article IX Section C by communicating with a currently seated USG member, who was CC’d on an email between supporters, and for violating Article IX Sections E and F for improperly using USG logos, and thus implying USG endorsed the candidates, on photos posted to Instagram.
The sanctions stipulate that both presidential and vice presidential tickets must remove all campaign material along Trousdale Parkway for the remainder of the campaign period. The material had to be removed by Wednesday at 8 a.m.
The Arkfeld-Cascante ticket and their team members will also not be allowed to campaign Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Trousdale Parkway between Child’s Way and 34th Street or in front of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Both Arkfeld and Cascante declined to comment on the decision. Kurth and Park did not respond to a request to comment.
Both complaints were filed Monday. Cody Rapp, a former Greek senator who has endorsed the Kurth-Ryan ticket, filed the official complaint against the Arkfeld-Cascante ticket. The Arkfeld-Cascante ticket brought the complaint against the Kurth-Park ticket.
Immediately after a complaint is filed, the elections commission takes a vote to determine if it is worthy of having a trial. If the commissioners decide it is worthy, a trial is set at a time when all parties can meet.
“We have this process in order to guarantees a fair race and make sure that people are held accountable,” said Alex Sellers, co-director of USG elections and recruitment. “Then, each candidate has the opportunity to do their best.”
Correction:  A previous version contained a typo that “USG members” received campaign materials from the Kurth-Park ticket. One member was CC’d on an email.  The Daily Trojan regrets the error. 
You should probably check your facts. Kurth-Park was not in fact cited for communicating with a USG member. The charge was waived.
Andddd in other news no one really cares about USG..
