After two back-to-back tournaments to start spring play, the women’s golf team will head to New Orleans for the Allstate Sugar Bowl. The team will look to bounce back from a rough start to the season at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge Feb. 3–5. 
	In the tournament, the team got off to a sluggish start and had to battle back from behind. USC finished at a solid third place, but as the No. 1 ranked team in the nation, the Women of Troy cannot afford to get outplayed by lower ranked opponents if they want to maintain their top spot. However, the Northrop Grumman Challenge was filled with elite level teams, including Pac-12 rivals and highly-ranked opponents in Stanford, Arizona and UCLA, as well as No. 2 Texas.  
	“We were a little disappointed not to win and we had to deal with some pretty nasty conditions, so it took a little time to get back into the flow,” head coach Justin Silverstein said.  
	Although the team as a whole struggled, Silverstein noted that sophomore Jennifer Chang played extraordinarily. Chang ended up with her best round of the season on the final day and finished the tournament tied for fourth.  
	Last week, several players competed in an individual event at the Battle of the Rock.  Among them, sophomore Alyaa Abdulghany came up with her first career title after finishing four under. Abdulghany has not been in the starting lineup for the past few tournaments but has shown promise when given the opportunity to perform in events.  
	At the Sugar Bowl this weekend, the Trojans will look to tighten their grasp on their top rank against another tough field. Going down south will be both a change of scenery and competition, as they will face more colleges from the Southeast as opposed to their normal slate of West Coast opponents.  
	“We will get some different weather and different grass, so we have to drive it well because the course has small greens,” Silverstein said. “We played there last year, and this golf course suits our style.”
In last season’s Sugar Bowl, the women managed to place second to a solid team in No. 18 Florida. This season, however, the Trojans are considerably stronger and should be favorites heading into Sunday’s matchup.  
At the end of the day, the teams they face may not only be USC’s biggest competition for a Pac-12 title, but also for an NCAA championship. Heading into the weekend as the No. 1 team, the Trojans have to remember that every tournament is key in proving that they deserve the top spot. They will kick off the Allstate Sugar Bowl Feb. 17 in New Orleans.

After starting the season strong, USC men’s and women’s tennis both experienced their first tastes of defeat last weekend. The teams are looking to regroup with some strong play to get their seasons back on track.
The men hope to rebound this weekend at the ITA National Indoor Championship in Chicago. After dropping their last three matches to No. 9 Stanford, No. 1 Ohio State and Cal, the Trojans will face the fourth-ranked Florida Gators. Following the tournament, USC will return home Feb. 22 to take on crosstown rival No. 6 UCLA.
The Trojans are currently in the middle of a schedule that has placed them against seven top-10 ranked teams in 10 matches, with three matches already under their belt. After that, the schedule eases up with four home matches against unranked teams to close out the season.
“I think we really have a chance to just do something special this year,” junior Riley Smith said. “[This] tournament is nothing different to us, and we are just going to go out there and compete.”
As for the Women of Troy, their season started with three straight wins, only to lose their most recent matchup against Southern Methodist University. The team was scheduled to play the Texas A&M Aggies last Sunday, but the competition was canceled due to inclement weather. The Trojans are now preparing to go on the road to play another non-conference team,  UC Santa Barbara.
Last Saturday, USC played a tight match against the Mustangs, splitting singles 3-3. The Mustangs left with the win after coming out on top in both of their doubles matches. The Trojans currently sit with an overall record of 3-1 in the middle of the Pac-12.
Against the Mustangs, doubles team juniors Becca Weissmann and Constance Branstine won both their singles matches but lost their doubles match in a close 6-4 game. Freshman Salma Ewing, the 24th-ranked player in the nation, lost her match against Mustangs sophomore Lisa Buss, 3-6, 4-6.
One unsung player for the Trojans this season has been freshman Danielle Willson, who is ranked No. 99 in the nation. In singles play this year, Willson is at 4-0, undefeated in collegiate singles matches. In doubles play, Willson has been almost perfect, collecting a record of 9-1 so far this season. If the Trojans hope to take the Pac-12 crown this season, they will have to rely on Willson’s dominating play. 
One player to keep an eye on for the Gauchos is senior Stephanie Yamada. Yamada, who was recently named Big West Conference Athlete of the Week, swept her matches this past weekend. The Trojans will need to beat Yamada if they wish to earn their fourth win of the season.
The Men of Troy will take on the Florida Gators Friday at the ITA National Team Indoor Championships in Chicago while the Women of Troy face the Gauchos Saturday in Santa Barbara.

After defeating Utah on the road but falling short in a close contest at Colorado, the Women of Troy will return home to face Cal and No. 10 Stanford this weekend.
These are second opportunities for USC to face the two schools, both of which defeated USC on the road this past January. In their last meeting with Cal, the Trojans fell to the Bears 59-66 despite a career-high 36-point performance by senior guard Mariya Moore. Moore, who is coming off two straight games with over 20 points, will need to put together another stellar performance if the Trojans are seeking to succeed this weekend.
Cal’s 14-9 record is identical to USC’s, and both teams have struggled against Pac-12 opponents. The Bears have conceded three straight games to top 10-ranked conference competitors.
A candidate for this year’s WNBA draft, Cal’s senior center/forward Kristine Anigwe poses a challenge for the Trojans on both ends of the court. Most notably, Anigwe leads the NCAA with 15.8 rebounds per game. She also ranks seventh in NCAA in scoring, with 22.8 average points per game. USC’s post players, including juniors Kayla Overbeck and Ja’Tavia Tapley, must focus their efforts on blocking out Anigwe to prevent her from securing second-chance scoring opportunities for her team. 
Although Cal averages 72.2 points per game, its average margin of victory is just 3.5 points. If Friday’s game adheres to this trend and becomes a close contest, it is crucial for the Trojans to focus for all 40 minutes of play.
“I think we have to focus more on everyone finishing together at one time … no matter what’s going on,” Tapley said following the Trojans’ late defeat at Colorado last weekend. “[When] we play as a team, when we play together, when we’re all focused together, we win. We have to focus more on that instead of individual problems.”
While both Cal and USC have losing records in conference play, Stanford boasts a 9-3 record against Pac-12 opponents. The Cardinal have the third-highest scoring offense in the Pac-12 with 77.6 points per game, compared to an average of 69.1 points for the Trojan offense. Senior forward Alanna Smith is at the forefront of Stanford’s attack, shooting 52.4 percent from the field and 42.6 percent from behind the arc.
In contrast to Cal’s small average point differential, Stanford is defeating its opponents by an average of 14.3 points per game. In their meeting with the Cardinal last month, the Trojans held a 2-point halftime lead, but a poor third quarter performance left them unable to come back in the fourth. The Trojans must start strong again on Sunday to set themselves up for victory in the second half.
USC’s three recent conference wins against Washington, Washington State and Utah have boosted their confidence heading into this weekend’s matchups. The team is beginning to showcase its talent and togetherness, qualities that allow it to challenge any competitor.
“We just take it a game at a time to be honest,” Tapley said. “We try to work together. We know that we have to come in and play as hard as we can every game, especially these next couple of games.”
The Women of Troy will compete at Galen Center this weekend against Cal Friday at 8 p.m. before facing Stanford Sunday at 12 p.m.

If you still think esports are not a legitimate profession, think again. China’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security announced last month that it will now recognize 15 new professions, two of which are in the realm of esports. Esports professionals and esports observers were welcomed in the same breath as A.I. engineers and drone pilots. 
But at the end of the day, why does that matter? The Chinese government validating a bunch of nerds playing World of Warcraft in their mom’s basement doesn’t necessarily make esports a legitimate profession. 
The second season of the Overwatch League started last night. Regardless of your stance on esports, no one can deny that it is a profitable business. Players, owners and coaches are making money (and a lot of it) off of video games, but the Overwatch League in particular presents one of the most intriguing business models in esports for a couple of reasons. 
First and foremost, Blizzard Entertainment, the company that created “Overwatch,” has done a wonderful job marketing the league to the typical esports viewer. In its inaugural season of “Overwatch” last year, Blizzard compiled the world’s best players into 12 teams and two divisions. This year, they have expanded the league to 20 teams. Starting small and expanding with demand, Blizzard was able to test the market and understand where to spend their energy. 
One of my biggest gripes with esports is that the tournament’s major/minor system most leagues use is way too confusing. I avidly watch and play several different esports video games. If I, or other esports fans, have a tough time understanding how everything fits together, it’s just proof that the barrier to entry is excessively high. By creating a league with a simple and easy-to-understand schedule format, the OWL instantly made itself one of the easiest esports to follow.
While there are 20 teams representing different cities and countries, like the Los Angeles Gladiators, Florida Mayhem and London Spitfire, all of the teams play in the same arena. At first glance, this may seem like a downfall to the league, but in reality, it is what will make it successful. 
By keeping these 20 teams in one location and one arena, Blizzard can easily control every aspect of the league and fan experience. OWL is incredibly experimental and spreading itself too thin would lead to its demise. From a pure economical standpoint, it’s genius. OWL doesn’t have to finance infrastructure in multiple cities, accommodate travel or worry about a negative response to the market in a particular city.
Although these teams are all branded to different cities and states, all of their home games are played in Los Angeles (Burbank, to be exact). This facade of hometown teams allows Blizzard to test the interest of the market in various cities. 
The beauty of streaming sports on platforms like Twitch.tv is that companies can pinpoint exactly who’s watching. The streaming platform’s metrics offer incredibly detailed data. So if one city is particularly averse to the OWL, Blizzard can respond accordingly by removing a franchise team representing that location. Using this data, Blizzard can also determine where the best locations to open new arenas will be, as they start to expand the league outside of Los Angeles. 
Last year, I was fortunate enough to cover an OWL match for the Daily Trojan. Admittedly, I didn’t know what was happening. My esport of choice at the time was “Counter Strike,” and the two games could not be more vastly different. I was there to cover the meet-and-greet between the Los Angeles Gladiators and USC’s esports club. 
Regardless of my lack of knowledge, I was shocked by Blizzard Arena and the Overwatch League. While sitting in the press room, I quickly began to catch on to how Overwatch is played, and I had some great conversations with fans and other journalists about the new league. The arena was packed with screaming fans of all ages, thundering voices from the exuberant commentators and eager players highly focused on their games. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. 
Tickets are relatively cheap, and games are streamed for free on Twitch. I was skeptical of esports at one point, too, but the OWL and similar leagues have proven themselves — without a doubt, they will quickly dominate the sports industry in the near future.

If you follow fashion or scroll through social media on a daily basis, you would know that last week marked a major annual event for designers — New York Fashion Week. All throughout NYC, top fashion designers, editors, models and influencers gathered to watch the epic shows. Whether the show takes place in a traditional runway space, outdoor garden or Instagram-worthy cafe setting (like Ralph Lauren’s), the new styles and trends on display at New York Fashion Week always intrigue the masses. 
For me, New York Fashion Week tends to be overwhelming because of the constant social media and editorial material posted throughout its duration. I’ve been working on keeping up with the best moments and emerging trends of the event for as long as I’ve had interest in fashion. 
From new hues and textures to completely groundbreaking silhouettes, the designers at New York Fashion Week offered no shortage of innovative looks. Not only did the designers provide amazing fashion inspiration, but the editors, influencers and models (as always) provided slightly more wearable street-style looks. Today, I’ve decided to share some of my favorite runway and street-style trends from NYFW. 
As a lover of simple elegance, I am always drawn to Ralph Lauren during Fashion Week. The show took place in the Ralph Lauren store on Madison Avenue that was elegantly transformed into a cafe guests could enjoy while the designer’s looks took the runway. 
The looks kept to the basic black, white and gold colors, all while employing a wide range of silhouettes. From breezy dresses in elegant black and white floral prints to a stunning gold dress modeled by Bella Hadid featuring a midi-hem and a pleated skirt, this collection emphasized glamour and elegance. I personally loved it because of the simple colors Ralph Lauren chose in conjunction with the interesting range of styles employed. 
Another noteworthy collection was designed by “Project Runway” winner Christian Siriano and featured a more couture tone. The collection, like many others by Siriano, featured fairytale silhouettes in bright plum and blue shades. Siriano also chose to dress supermodel Ashley Graham in crystals from head to toe — literally. 
As an avid “Project Runway” fan, I have always enjoyed following Siriano and his career. While his collections may not be as relatable to my everyday wardrobe, I find them inspiring and thought-provoking. I love how his looks always allow for a moment of fashion escape and inspiration. 
While there were many other amazing designers featured, another part of Fashion Week that I always look forward to is scouring street-style websites like StyleDuMonde and CollageVintage to see what members in the fashion industry are wearing between shows. One major trend I noticed was oversized puffer jackets. Originally from the East Coast, I am a huge fan of the puffer jacket, and I was excited to see that so many fashion insiders have the same affinity for the warm yet stylish piece of outerwear.
The inspiration from New York Fashion Week tends to provide me with different outfit combinations for months to come. While I still don’t feel completely caught up with all of the amazing displays that occurred last week, I am excited about the range of styles displayed by the different designers that I did manage to see. 
I loved the ability designers like Lauren and Siriano have to provide a clear and unique insight into the world of fashion through their shows. After last week, I am more excited than ever about the outfits that will begin to emerge from the trends that appeared at NYFW.

Designing a theme park is every child’s dream, and every year, Walt Disney Imagineering makes it a reality. Their annual competition challenges students from across the nation to design conceptual theme parks based on a  creative prompt. Out of hundreds of entries, only six teams are chosen and given a chance to work with Disney Imagineers to develop their projects and present them to the judges. This year, students were asked to develop a plan for an amusement park experience based on a natural or ancient wonder of the world. 
Senior Triet Nguyen was part of a team of students who won second place.
“I couldn’t believe [my] ears,” Nguyen said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It was so surreal, I don’t think any vocabulary can describe the feeling. I can’t thank my amazing teammates, Kyle, Brooke, and Katie enough. They are simply the most wonderful in what they do and everything they are. I’m so proud of their talent, passion, and creativity, and I’m so proud of what we have designed.”
Nguyen’s team comprised students from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, University of Florida and Savannah College of Art and Design. Another USC team, comprising alumni Rachel Bennett and Hyungee (Clara) Ryu, were also finalists in the competition. A separate team from the Savannah College of Art and Design took home the first-place prize. 
Nguyen’s team decided to construct their project — a resort named “Port Pharos” —  based on the Lighthouse of Alexandria, the famous ancient Egyptian landmark said to have been built in 280 B.C. 
“Because we [wanted] to design this attraction for families, we were [thinking], ‘What is the most fun thing we can do?’” Nguyen said. “And that’s sort of how we landed on the Lighthouse, because we thought that this space was really full of history, culture and a lot of activities we thought would be really great for families to do together.” 
For Bennett and Ryu, the creative prompt was instrumental in their decision to submit to the competition. 
“I had heard of the competition from a few of my friends who work at Disney,” Ryu said. “[Two years ago], Rachel and I were trying to organize a team together, and it didn’t work out. We decided to do it again this year because we both liked the prompt.”
The team decided to replicate a natural phenomenon through their amusement park.
“Clara and I came across the Northern Lights,” Bennett said. “We developed a theme park through the lens of Inuit folklore on the Northern Lights.” 
Their park, which they called “Atsanik,” features an interactive museum and a restaurant inside an aurora cavern. 
For both teams, however, the competition was not without its obstacles. 
“Usually, the other teams would have everyone from the same school,” Nguyen said. “The challenge with our team was that we had to work through video-chatting platforms. So we’d just meet every single week to sort of brainstorm and critique our work, and then we’d branch off to do our own work.”
Bennett and Ryu, although in closer proximity to one another, still struggled to juggle school, work and the project.  
“It was a very work-intensive project, and right now I have work full-time,” Bennett said. “So it is a lot of sleepless nights where you’re working pretty hard … finding the right time to work on all of it, that became difficult at times.”
Despite their different backgrounds, the three Imagineering competition finalists agreed USC has helped them advance their career goals. 
Nguyen said USC was the perfect place to develop his passion for amusement parks. 
“I came from Vietnam, so obviously, the field of designing theme parks was a very rare thing there,” Nguyen said. “ So, it was definitely very exciting for me to go across the world to USC to pursue a career within the field … being and living in L.A. where all the amazing companies are, being able to network with all the amazing people … and having Disneyland just like right down the street, has been amazing, and I’m really thankful for all of that.”
Ryu, on the other hand, didn’t know she wanted to design theme parks. She came to USC wanting to be a production designer for film, but she was soon pushed to find new ways to implement her design passion. 
“I came with a really vague idea of what the profession consisted of,” Ryu said. “I realized that … the art department personnel on films could also work in theater and advertising, performance arts and theme parks, and that’s how I got to start thinking about Disney as a career … I think the best part of USC is that it provides a lot of opportunities that you don’t realize exist.”
Nguyen, Bennett and  Ryu all hope their success in the Imagineering competition, combined with the lessons they have learned at USC, will successfully advance their careers in design.

The rain and cold weather gripping Los Angeles in the past few weeks has prompted new conversations about the cause-and-effect relationship between weather and mood. While seasonal affective disorder may not be commonly discussed at campuses like USC, it is a mental health concern that affects many college students across the United States. Destigmatizing mental illnesses, especially SAD, is worthy of conversation at USC, and the student community should do more to engage in such discourse. 
SAD is a type of depression that emerges with seasonal changes. Symptoms often begin in the fall and winter months. In some cases, SAD can also affect people during the summer months, and in those cases, symptoms become more prominent during the spring. Those who experience SAD experience symptoms like loss of interest in activities, fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating and, in extreme cases, thoughts of self-harm and suicide. 
Increasing SAD awareness can also help promote discourse about overall depression on campus. In a recent article published by the University of Michigan’s Michigan Daily, clinical director Jim Dolan stated that almost a quarter of students report depression as a primary concern in their daily lives. But a 2016 freshman survey conducted by the UCLA Higher Education Research Institute found that a record-high number of 11.9 percent of students in the incoming class reported that they frequently felt depressed over the past year.
Although many college campuses, including USC, have increased accessibility and expanded their counseling services, the stigma surrounding mental health on campus directly affects the number of students who choose to seek treatment. In a recent study, UCLA sociology professor Michael Gaddis concluded that college campuses with higher stigma toward mental health treatment see less treatment seeking behavior among students. With this in mind, students have the responsibility to create a campus culture that openly talks about mental health. 
While USC Student Health has made efforts to increase student awareness and destigmatize mental health on campus through the expansion of counseling resources and advertising available resources throughout campus, it is also incumbent upon students to participate in destigmatizing these issues. Because students can feel uncomfortable discussing topics as personal and private as their emotional well-being, discussions about SAD are commonly discouraged in general conversations. 
At USC, students should approach conversations about mental health with more open minds. USC students can take the lead on changing campus culture by starting conversations with their peers about common mental health struggles. Students should also actively educate themselves and others about mental illness. 
All students should feel compelled to take part in learning about mental health issues. Undiagnosed and untreated illnesses can result in severe consequences for students experiencing them. Students should feel incentivized to be attentive and empathetic toward their peers — mutual empathy maintains the vitality of the University and keeps the Trojan Family strong. 
Decreasing the stigma surrounding depression and SAD can be accomplished through simple acts. Individuals can lessen the mental health stigma by asking peers how they are doing, normalizing vulnerability and encouraging others to talk about mental health with peers or counselors.
Although SAD may not widely regarded as an issue that affects many USC students, it falls under an umbrella of mental health issues that can affect anyone. Students should feel as comfortable talking about their emotional and mental well-being as their physical health, a mindset that can only be achieved through communal efforts to combat mental health stigma on campus. To improve the quality of life on campus, students should actively work to increase their own awareness and become more compassionate members of the USC community.

After working at the Center of Black Cultural and Student Affairs, for seven years, Director Rosalind Conerly will be leaving USC. Her last day at USC will be March 1.
“My time at USC has been truly life changing,” Conerly wrote in an email to CBCSA members. “And that is mostly due to the relationships I have been able to establish with students and colleagues over the years. You, in some way, have helped shape my experience, so thank you.”
Conerly will take on a new role at Stanford University in June, where she will serve as the associate dean of students and director of the Black Community Services Center. She also plans to expand her role as a consultant in Palo Alto. During her time at USC, Rosalind assisted employers with finding effective recruitment strategies and integrating professionals from marginalized communities to predominantly white institutions.
“I will be doing similar work, really overseeing a lot of the operations and vision planning,” she said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I will be managing a lot more people and initiatives.” 
As the associate dean of students, her work will primarily focus on serving the black community at Stanford. She will also be working closely with their Black Alumni Association. Her first event will be the Stanford Black Alumni Summit in Hollywood, where she will introduce herself to BAA alumni and begin to transition into her new role. 
Conerly became the CBCSA director in late 2016, having previously served as assistant director under former director Corliss Bennett. Conerly also served as an adjunct assistant professor at the Rossier School of Education while conducting research on how scholar practitioners oversee various cultural centers and how these centers help students of color. She received her doctorate in education from Rossier in 2016. 
“One of my top highlights [at USC] was our 40th anniversary,” she said. “Being able to celebrate and acknowledge the narratives of the students, the alumni that are now attached to CBCSA … it really made me reflect on understanding why this space is here and to see how it’s evolved.”  
Conerly said she promises to stay connected and involved in USC campus life and events. Over her two-year tenure as CBCSA director, she mentored and engaged with students of color and helped create inclusion workshops around campus. 
“She is sweet and a great leader,” said JaBrea Patterson-West, a junior majoring in French and art history. “She was always supportive of [the Black Student Assembly’s] e-board and was an important mentor and communicator of student needs, not just in the black community but [to] all cultural centers.”  
Prior to her departure, Conerly wanted to ensure that CBCSA had structures in place that would remain long after she left. She said she has focused her time on creating a safe, empowering space for students that would inspire them, and she hopes the University will take advantage of the increased calls for diversity and inclusion on campus and strengthen relationships with culture groups on campus. 
“As our community grows, as our initiatives change, students need change,” she said. “I’m going to miss USC, there is definitely an energy on this campus … It’s something in the air here that really makes you excited to be here and to be a part of this Trojan Family.”

When the time came for Adrianna Carter to go to college, several factors drew her to USC: financial aid, strong sports teams and a push from her mother. Now set to graduate in May with a bachelor’s degree in biology and a master’s degree in global medicine, Carter said she wouldn’t have it any other way. 
However, USC wasn’t the perfect option for her. Over the past four years, she’s felt the Trojan pride on campus, but thought that she was always lacking something.
“I wanted to get that experience of being around more black people that were like-minded,” Carter said. 
Black students make up 5.6 percent of USC’s population as of last fall. Carter said she has always been one of few black students in her classes. So when she heard about USC’s Historically Black College and University Exchange Program during an information session at her freshman dorm, she knew she had to participate. She is now spending her final semester at Howard University in Washington, D.C. — one of the highest ranked historically black colleges in the country.
The program, led by the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, offers students a choice between three HBCUs: Spelman College, Dillard University and Howard. Carter is the only USC student participating in the exchange program this semester, which CBCSA director Rosalind Conerly said is not unusual.
“It has to be an even exchange,” Conerly said. “We’ve had years where [the HBCU’s] students are ready to go, [and] they want to come this way, but we may not have any students … that are able to complete the application process to go that way.” 
While  the program’s application process is lengthy -— something that has turned prospective participants off in the past — Carter was lucky, because Howard sophomore Alexandria Frank wanted to spend her spring semester at USC.
Frank decided she wanted to attend an HBCU in October 2016, weeks before the election of President Donald Trump. As the environment at her predominantly white high school became increasingly stressful for her, Frank said the idea of attending an all-black institution became more appealing. 
“I was like, ‘I don’t want to do this anymore,’ so after that I was pretty much gung-ho for Howard,” Frank said. “I didn’t grow up around a lot of black people, but when I got to Howard it was very easy to slip into the community.” 
Frank said she chose USC so that she could be closer to her family in Corona, but transitioning to the new environment was difficult for her.
“I feel like it’s actually harder for me to adjust to USC culture … than it was for Howard,” Frank said. “I was [telling] one of my friends the other day, I have withdrawal from being around black people.” 
California dreamin’
Frank, who is majoring in psychology and minoring in journalism and classical civilizations, attended a private high school in Riverside. She said her parents’ desire to see her more was a driving force in her decision to participate in the exchange program.
“I see my family every weekend,” Frank said. “I allow myself to go home constantly, knowing that when I’m back in D.C., I won’t be able to.” 
Unlike Carter, who is finishing her biology degree, Frank’s course load for the semester is varied. In addition to classes on subjects like modern Latin America and microeconomics, Frank said she is sitting in on two additional classes: sports media and a television symposium at the School of Cinematic Arts. 
At Howard, Frank said she often attends her professors’ office hours to discuss anything from her personal life to homework assignments. Here, she said she hasn’t felt a desire to connect with any professors.
“I don’t really have any sort of connection with my professors here, especially not like I do at Howard,” Frank said. “At Howard, I’ve had a professor who I’ve taken two semesters back to back … most professors who I’ve had, I’ve gone to their office hours.”
Molly Myerowitz, a professor and chair of the classics department at Howard, wrote a recommendation for Frank to participate in the exchange program. Myerowitz said she recommended Frank because she knew she wouldn’t “blow it off.” 
“She’s a terrific student, she is somebody who will get the most out of the experience,” Myerowitz said. “[And] she’s a California girl. [It’s] nice for her to have a year in warm climes.” 
While Frank said she missed California and is enjoying her classes, she said she sometimes experiences imposter syndrome, since only 5.6 percent of USC students are black.  
“It took me a minute to realize that I was the only black person in my sports media class, and I was like ‘Oh, this feels weird again,’” Frank said.  
Howard away from home
In sixth grade, Carter decided she wanted to become a doctor. She hopes to eventually open a clinic in Los Angeles for underserved people of color. 
“I’m interested in going into obstetrics/gynecology to serve black women to make sure that they get the right treatment and that their problems are being taken seriously,” Carter said. 
Carter’s mother is a nurse, which she said inspired her to pursue a career in medicine. She decided to pursue a progressive degree during her junior year at USC and attended summer courses to make sure she could graduate on time. She is also a USC Spirit Leader, a student worker at Dornsife School of Letters, Arts and Sciences and a member of African Americans in Health and Alpha Kappa Alpha, a majority-black sorority founded at Howard in 1908. 
While Carter knew she wanted to participate in the HBCU Exchange Program since her freshman year, she worried she wouldn’t be able to as her responsibilities piled up.  
“I actually didn’t think I was going to be able to do [the program] until this semester came around, and I was like, ‘I only have my undergrad units left, so this is something I want to do,’” Carter said. 
Although it is rare for students to participate in an exchange program during their final semester, Carter said she was determined to spend a semester at Howard, even if it meant missing her last one at USC. She is currently taking three different science classes, which she said are much harder than the classes she took at USC.
Carter’s academic adviser, Lila Mendoza, said she was impressed by Carter’s determination to participate in the program. 
“She has a lot of ambition and drive,” Mendoza said. “[Most students] give up hope [on] the exchange program], but not Adrianna. She said she wanted to do it, and she’s getting it done.” 
Carter said Howard’s smaller class sizes — usually 10 people or less — have helped her connect with professors and classmates more than she could at USC. 
“Because I am black, surrounded by other black students … it’s like everybody is rooting for each other,” Carter said. “It’s amazing … I’m really enjoying the experience.”

Provost Michael Quick released a memo detailing the search for a new Marshall School of Business dean to the school’s faculty, staff and students Thursday.
The beginning of the search comes approximately two months after Interim President Wanda Austin’s decision to terminate Dean James Ellis due to complaints from faculty and staff filed through the Office of Equity and Diversity. 
“This search comes at an important time for our university and for the Marshall School,” the memo read. “We want to continue the tremendous momentum at the school, which is renowned for its academic rigor, strong interdisciplinary research and [for] attracting the most talented students and faculty from across the globe.”
Quick and Gould School of Law Dean Andrew Guzman will co-chair the 11-person advisory search committee.
“This committee will identify and recruit the best candidates,” the memo read. “Members of this committee represent a range of expertise and experience from across the Marshall School.”
According to the memo, professors Anthony Dukes, Yingying Fan, Elissa Grossman, Shaun Harper, Aysen Imrohoroglu, Marion Philadelphia, Cheryl Wakslak, Adlai Wertman and T.J. Wong will reach out to the Marshall community for input throughout the search.
“I am also pleased to announce that I have a created a special group of advisers who represent important Marshall constituencies and who will be available to the committee throughout the search,” the memo read. 
Representatives that will guide the committee during the process include: trustee Jaime Lee, Marshall Board of Leaders member Eric Holoman, Marshall associate dean Sharoni Little, senior associate dean for finance and administration Sunny Donenfeld, senior associate dean for finance and administration, Marshall Undergraduate Student Association President Weber Wong and Graduate Student Association President Parin Patel. 
Quick wrote that the committee will work with Associate Vice Provost Robin Romans and consultants Kristine Johnson and Chuck Jordan from executive recruitment firm Spencer Stuart. 
The memo outlined the advisory committee’s next steps. All nominations for the position will be brought to the committee, and any member with input regarding a final candidate will be invited to send comments to the search committee or Quick. Austin will make the final decision, according to the memo. 
“Dean Ellis and President Austin have agreed that he will stay on as dean of the school until a new dean is announced, after a national search,” Quick wrote.
In December it was announced that Ellis would leave his position in June. However, the memo stated Ellis will remain as dean until a new hire is found.
