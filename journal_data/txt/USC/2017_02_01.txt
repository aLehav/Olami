A tale of farming, passion and vodka, Anton Chekhov’s play Uncle Vanya  comes to life with a performance from USC’s master of fine arts acting-training students. Uncle Vanya takes place in turn-of-the-century rural Russia, yet expresses timeless themes.
 “Are we happier today than we were a year ago? Or for that matter, are we as a nation with all our technical advances any happier as individuals than we were decades ago?’ The characters in Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya are left to ponder many of those same questions we face today,” the playbill reads.
 This production stars MFA students Jim French and Charles Stern as Vanya and Alexandr, respectively, two competing and bitter brother-in-laws. Kristina Hanna plays Yelena, the charming wife of Alexandr and the apple of Vanya’s eye. Ryan Alex Holmes takes on the role of the bitter, introspective country doctor, Mikhail, sprinkling his insights throughout the play.
 Gregg Daniel, the director of Uncle Vanya,  has several accolades and accomplishments under his belt. He received the 2016 NAACP Best Director award and a Broadway World nomination for Best Director. Daniel is also a founding member and artistic director of Lower Depth Theatre Ensemble and has over 100 credits to his name, including True Blood, Spider-Man 3 and most recently, Jericho.
 “Every actor needs something different. [Directing] teaches me something about myself. How do I keep actors engaged?” Daniel said in an interview with @ This Stage, a publication. “Generalities kill art. You want to wake people up. You don’t want them to know how everything is going to go.”
 Uncle Vanya is the first of a three-part repertory that culminates the MFA acting program. The MFA acting program is a three-year program that combines classical conservatory training with new physical techniques.
 “The program envisions a self-motivated, collaborative and flexible actor working with purpose to make choices based on her or his personal imagery, and having the craft to execute those choices with clear and decisive actions,” the description reads.
 This collection of plays acts as their master’s thesis. The founding director of the MFA program, Andy Robinson, outlines this repertory’s purpose as gaining a well-rounded set of skills and allowing them to immediately enter the industry in any role.
 “What the actor learns from being a working member of an ensemble is every bit as important as learning the nuts and bolts of the craft. To be a true ensemble player, one develops a vital connection and a responsibility to the other players,” Robinson said in a description of the repertory experience.
 An essential part of the repertory experience is gaining versatility and flexibility as an actor.
 “Nothing stretches an actor more than to struggle with a character that’s 180 degrees removed from her or his type,” Robinson said, “It’s this kind of miscasting that often allows for revelatory performance.”
 Uncle Vanya will take place at the Scene Dock Theatre, Feb. 3 to 4, 15 to 16, 25 to 26 and March 3 to 4 at various times. Tickets and additional information can be found on the MFA site.

If Jimmy Elder ever decides to start a cult religion, his genesis story would be ready to go.
“I was born to Dvorak 9 — the Largo from the “New World” symphony,” he said. “My dad did his undergrad and master’s in music composition, so he was like this huge music nerd. He insisted that it be played while I was born.”
The piece is an expansive, epic portrait of the virgin America. It overflows with majesty and reverence, as befits the birth of a future tuba player. When we spoke, Jimmy told me that to this day, he loves classical music that conveys the sense of awesome scale heard in the New World. 
Jimmy is a junior majoring in tuba performance and plays for the Thornton Symphony. I asked him how he became a musician. It turns out that he didn’t settled on being a music major — or even a tuba player — until late in high school. 
“I hated the tuba, but my band director wouldn’t let me switch. So I got stuck on the tuba, and I’ve played that ever since. It worked out,” he said.
I asked how he decided to major in music.
“Junior year is when I decided that that’s what I wanted to do,” Elder said. “I just noticed that I was involved in a lot of extracurricular ensembles outside of my school’s band. I was in this Pacific Symphony Youth Wind Ensemble, and I was in this Colburn Wind Ensemble group. So after doing all of that, I was kind of putting tuba ahead of my schoolwork, in high school, which my GPA definitely reflects.” 
But there was an important social component, too — something I noticed helps a lot of musicians make the leap from pursuing music as a hobby to working toward a career in it.
“When I was in high school, all the people I was hanging out with were people from these ensembles,” Elder said. “A lot of them all went on to become music majors. So you have this stream, where all your friends are becoming music majors. It seemed like that was the way to go.”
That made me curious about the sort of music that Jimmy’s friends were feeding him. I asked if there was any correspondence between the music Jimmy listened to and the different steps he’s taken in his musical career.
“I don’t think so. I keep my classical stuff, and then there’s everything else, like rock, or some pop or jazz. Those two are mutually exclusive, I think,” he said.
Elder elaborated that for much of his early life, he only listened to the classical music his dad put on the stereo.
“Some of my earliest memories are listening to Stravinsky — like Firebird, and The Rite of Spring.  The Rite of Spring is quite the piece to play for a 4-year-old kid!” he said.
Elder explained how his father would go into detail what was happening and what it symbolizes. “I was like, ‘OK, this is really terrifying, Dad!’”
Just as it took him a long time to set his heart on being a professional musician, it was only recently that Jimmy began to actively pursue non-classical music for himself.
“In high school, through my friends, social media and stuff, I started discovering stuff that wasn’t classical music,” he said.
The first song Jimmy bought on iTunes, he confessed bashfully, was “Dynamite” by Taio Cruz. Yes, that one. Jimmy was quick to add that he’s moved beyond Top 40.
I asked what pulled him away.
“Spotify, honestly, and a new friend group,” he said. “Because, you know, after high school you don’t really see your friends from high school any more. That’s how I got introduced to stuff like Childish Gambino, who I like, and Chance the Rapper.” 
But Jimmy still listens to the non-classical songs in his library with a musician’s critical ear. Indeed, he has recently been put on the spot to identify great examples of American pop music — because he serves as a conversation partner for Japan Exchange Student Support, a student organization that helps out Japanese students who study English at USC’s International Academy.
When I met Jimmy this week, he had just come from a meeting with his conversation partner, Nozomi. Nozomi is a jazz pianist. So, though Jimmy studies Japanese himself, he joked that music is an easy way to fill the time of his one-hour meetings with Nozomi.
“The only American band that she knows is Coldplay. And I don’t know any Japanese bands. So, we set up an exchange, where I’m going to send her artists that are similar to Coldplay. And she likes Japanese rock and jazz, so she’s going to send me some,” he added.
I asked, “You’re sort of like a diplomat of American music. So what do you pitch?”
Jimmy admitted that he’s having trouble narrowing it down. For now, he’s settled on only one name. 
“Young the Giant. They have some good stuff. There’s something interesting about them,” he said.
“Do you fit the stereotypes of a tuba player in your music taste?” I asked — meaning music that’s all about the low end, with less emphasis on lyrics and melody.
“I don’t really like EDM and things like that, where it’s all about how much bass you can put in the music,” he said. I really don’t like that. When I’m listening to classical music though, for sure. Whenever there’s heavy bottom, like Mahler, Wagner, things like that with lots of low brass, I love it.”
It’s as though Jimmy is bilingual in both music and speech. When he’s working on tuba, he wants to hear tuba solos. But when he’s casually listening, Jimmy applies a totally different set of criteria. I asked him to start me off with some classical music recommendations.
“For sure, Respighi. He wrote this Roman Trilogy. Fountains of Rome—that one. I think it’s the third movement. There’s a huge tuba excerpt where it’s very low, very loud. That’s one of my favorites for sure,” he said.
I asked him for another recommendation.
“Prokofiev in Romeo and Juliet. The ‘Montagues and Capulets.’ That one is like a huge tuba excerpt. But it’s not like a technical excerpt,” he said, meaning it doesn’t simply show off the tubist’s speed and range. 
Instead, Jimmy said, “You just have like these fat notes.”
Jimmy usually only listens to music when he drives — not when he does homework, like other students. 
He added,“Actually, on that note, the one thing I do listen to the most when I do study, if I am listening to music, is minimalism, like Steve Reich, Music for 18 Musicians, or John Adams, ‘Short Ride in a Fast Machine’ or the Foxtrot suite.”
I could never listen to that and study. But Jimmy doubled down.
 “It’s like, the same thing for like 30 minutes,” he said. “I don’t have to think about it. It’s predictable. It’s like, this groovy rhythm that I can just vibe to.”
Jimmy told me about his newfound pop tastes.
“I’m drawn to certain pop and rock pieces and I’m not to others. I like things that I have an emotional connection to. Lyrics in particular play a certain role. When I’m really feeling down and depressed, I like Sufjan Stevens. ‘Should Have Known Better’ by Sufjan Stevens,” he said.
He continued on, listing out the English indie rock band Glass Animals. 
“They have a couple of songs that you probably have heard of before. They definitely released one of the greatest albums of the year. It’s called How to Be a Human Being. Glass animals, they kind of have … I never understand a word that the guy says, like the lyrics, but their music is so — it creates this atmosphere that I’m really attracted to,” Jimmy said.
I asked about the common appeal of Glass Animals, Sufjan Stevens and Chance, whom Jimmy had mentioned earlier.
“With Chance, I just respect him a lot as an artist. He’s very anti-label, he releases all his music for free, he never sells albums. Seeing how much he’s accomplished as a person is just incredible: When you listen to him, you’re listening to the product of how much he’s fought against the label system and things like that,” Jimmy said.
“Is that something you strive for in your own music?” I asked.
Jimmy suddenly switched musical languages. “Being independent? As a tuba player? No, not at all! I think as a tuba player I do the exact opposite,” he said. I try and strive to be like what everyone else has been. It’s kind of the opposite. I strive to be like — I’ll listen to recordings of famous tuba players, like Pokorny and Tim Buzbee. I try to make the sounds they’re making and be able to play the way they play.”
As a tuba player, Jimmy can’t help but love those classical masterworks with pounding, intense tuba. But his sideways introduction into the world of pop music has led him to fascinating, often contradictory musical tastes. He still loves intensity in music, but looks for it in the lyrics, the atmosphere or the musician’s character, rather than the bassline.
As much as Jimmy’s mental landscape is partitioned between the musical languages he speaks, his ability to switch registers with ease makes him an engaging ambassador — of music and culture alike.

Who could forget when President Donald Trump called Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman” at the final presidential debate back in October? The impulsive quip seamlessly transformed into a meme overnight, as well as an ironic rallying cry for Clinton supporters and women who proudly speak up for their rights, demand respect and shoulder harassment and condescension as a result.
Being criticized and disparaged and called angry, extra and, yes, even “nasty” for being vocal and passionate about anything is just part of being a woman — especially being a young woman. For example, the terms “feminazi” and “social justice warrior” have recently emerged on social media as young feminists speak up against attacks on reproductive rights, the recent Muslim immigration ban and other concerning political threats against marginalized groups by the Trump administration.
These labels ignore the historically powerful struggle for social progress that feminism encompasses and continue the longstanding tradition of condescending upon young women and trivializing the things they feel strongly about, from Starbucks, to Uggs, to boybands and, today, to political advocacy and social justice.
Calling people “feminazis” and “SJWs” sends the message that the identity-based causes we are advocating for are petty and irrelevant, that we are backing inconsequential issues, picking unnecessary fights and even attacking free speech rights. To those who have never experienced some form of identity-based harassment or discrimination, feminism has already won its battle, and those of us who continue to fight are being whiny and overly sensitive.
It’s easy to view a transgender individual’s struggle to safely use the bathroom without harassment or threat of arrest and have their gender pronouns respected, as petty demands when you are cisgender and will never have to fight for recognition. It’s easy to shrug off advocacy for Planned Parenthood and reproductive rights with the retort “abortion is already legal” when you’ll never have to worry about dehumanizing infringements on your bodily autonomy. It’s easy to roll your eyes at “trigger warnings” when you’re not a survivor of sexual assault struggling with PTSD. After all, privilege is often blinding, and results in unnecessarily hostile responses to people who fight for equal rights and respect or have the audacity to point out that inequality exists — all the more so when those raising their voices are young women.
There are, inevitably, situations where some feminists can respond disproportionately to slips of tongue, inadvertent omissions or accidental microaggressions. An example of this might be labeling Ashton Kutcher an ableist for failing to bring up the rights of differently abled people in his Screen Actors Guild award speech on Sunday. Individual incidents can be sensationalized by internet activists who are quick to anger without context, but ultimately, who really gets to define what is a serious issue worthy of young women’s advocacy? What should or shouldn’t be called out and discussed?
Our nation was established on the very free speech rights that those who dub vocal feminists as “feminazis” accuse us of violating. In a society built on free speech, no one has the sweeping authority to dismiss issues as unworthy of discussion and protest. If it’s fair to demand that people be less sensitive, it should also be fair to demand that people be more respectful and socially conscious.
To call passionate feminists “feminazis” also establishes an uncomfortable false equivalence between feminists and far-right neo-Nazis. I fail to understand how viewing people of color and women as subhuman could be perceived as the same evil of demanding respect for pronouns and gender identity or how calls to end universal suffrage equate to calls for universal healthcare.
In a sad twist of irony, the push for the abandonment of identity politics and advocacy, which purportedly led to Trump’s election by alienating privileged people uncomfortable with hearing about the experiences of marginalized groups, has gained momentum at a time when those of marginalized identities are under greater threat than ever. Nearly every executive order and statement by our new president serves to validate and potentially embolden bigots, and despite legitimate cause to fight for the civil liberties of women and all minorities, disdainful labels such as “feminazi” and “social justice warrior” by the privileged send the message that these issues don’t matter.
Despite this derision and taunting, we must always remember that there is nothing wrong with maintaining high standards for the way you and others are treated. If you feel disrespected, if you notice inequality and are outraged by it, don’t let anyone shame you into silence. Your experiences matter, your feelings matter and the issues you care about  — if for no other reason than because you care about them — matter, and you owe it to yourself to speak up.

I think people from both sides of the political spectrum are guilty of misusing labels in their effort to demonize each other.  It’s gotten to the point that free speech has been hijacked on college campuses.  Take a look at what happened last night at Berkeley, for example.  College students aren’t allowed to hear both sides of an argument or debate because one side quashes the other.  So those students will go through their four years of college only hearing one viewpoint, believing it’s the correct viewpoint.  That’s not the point of a college education and it’s certainly against freedom of speech.  That is un-American.
That is exactly the problem – your concern with identity politics. The failing of racists is that they view people as members of a group before they view them as an individual. They take their beliefs about the group(s) the person may belong to as inviolate traits of the individual, when reality may be completely different. Identity politics does the exact same thing as racists, with seemingly better intentions.
MLK called for engaging with a person based on the content of their character and not the color of their skin. But how many times have we heard from SJWs that “Cis, white men are privileged and oppressors and need to shut up and sit down?” It’s endless. Even the women’s march featured a ton of BLM signs stating how “White women elected Trump.” The obsession with identity as political is exactly the crux of Middle America’s disgust with SJWs and, by comparison, “Feminazis” who are incentivized to become never-ending victims, finding new affronts and offenses, daily. The vast majority of American women reject third wave feminism as it’s more obsessed with victimhood and brow-beating men than in actually acknowledging that the sexes are different and each has their perks and their strengths.
Emboldening bigots is something feminists are totally fine with, as long as they’re biggoted against the same people feminists are. BLM activists regularly scream “F white people” and call for violence against police “pigs in a blanket, fry em’ like bacon” etc… “F white men” and the variations are too numerous and readily available anywhere on youtube or a quick google search. Let’s not pretend that modern feminism isn’t a fringe movement more concerned with its own perpetuation than with acknowledging any actual equality that exists in this country.
Right you are. People sometimes think it cute to use “Nazi,” “Holocaust,” and similar words of death and horror to describe the actions or character of those they dislike. This is despicable. “Strident feminists?” “Militant feminists?” Yes, maybe some feminists are. But to characterize feminists as “Nazis.” is another matter.
you should close down the comments before they arrive.

As high school seniors across the nation submit the last of their college applications, it is worth considering the role of Advanced Placement classes and exams in the college admissions process. The AP system has long been controversial, and with good reason. Research suggests that it disproportionately disadvantaged minority and low-income students who are more likely to attend schools that do not offer these courses. This ultimately raises the question of to what extent AP classes should be weighed in the admissions process, as well as what solutions exist, if any, to amend this current cycle of inequality.
According to a report by the Atlantic, despite how universities claim to consider the availability of AP courses at students’ schools when comparing applicants, there still persists an implicit advantage favoring students with access to these courses. Even if a student’s school offers AP courses, there are too many cases of students being unable to pay the fee to take the exams. In this sense, the AP system appears to inherently promote income inequity in universities by contributing to the current phenomenon of income being a deciding factor in whether or not students attend college as well as the prestige of the college they attend.
It is true that the accessibility of AP courses and exams in more well-off school districts is just one of many advantages they have over districts in low-income communities. Students from more economically advantaged schools also have the privilege of counselors, organizations facilitating student involvement and college preparation and preparation for standardized tests like the ACT and SAT, among many other resources. On top of the inequality that naturally arises when it comes to who has access to the AP system and who doesn’t, there is controversy as to the extent to which AP courses truly reflect college readiness. Material is often condensed in order to be taught over the course of less than a year in AP classes, and experts question how well a single exam can reflect a student’s expertise in any given subject.
It is impossible to account for all of the economic inequality in schools across the country, but reevaluating the way AP tests and classes are regarded in the admissions process could make a difference in the academic prospects of poor and minority students. Institutions of higher learning must adopt fairer standards for how AP courses and exams are weighed in the admissions process. 
According to USC’s website, there is “no minimum requirement or absolute ‘cutoff’ for grades, class rank, or test scores.” USC states that it “evaluates prospective students through an individualized, comprehensive review process that takes these, and many other factors, into account,” but additionally notes that first-year students are often “from the top 10 percent of their high school classes.” It must be applauded when college admissions panels more holistically approach the admissions process. But simultaneously, universities such as USC must also be more transparent about the role of AP courses and exams in their decision-making for prospective undergraduate students, reach out to underprivileged communities to promote true diversity on their campuses and also educate students attending schools with less access to the AP system about alternative ways they can demonstrate their academic ambition.
Ultimately, college admissions panels cannot simply cease to consider AP courses and tests as a whole; there is no perfect system for measuring students’ academic aptitude and ambition, and it would be inefficient to sweepingly throw out a system that has long been in place rather than simply reform it and make it more accessible to everyone. Elite institutions like USC must involve themselves in pushing the College Board to lower costs for AP exams, on top of participating in outreach to engage, support and educate students of disadvantaged communities. There must be more transparency in weighing students’ AP scores and grades in AP classes, as well as how they evaluate the academic records of students who lack this privilege.
It is deeply unsettling that the socioeconomic position of students is a decisive predictor of whether or not they will attend college, as well as the ranking of the college they attend. Their access to private tutoring, counseling and, of course, AP classes and tests, through economic privilege, has contributed to the current state of economic inequity and the underrepresentation of minority students in campuses across the nation. Campuses with less diversity are ultimately detrimental to their students, who will have less exposure to different identities and the wide range of ideas that naturally come from diverse communities. Universities must make fostering diversity on campus not just a goal but a priority. It starts wth reevaluating how AP exams and courses are weighed in the admissions process.
Cheung and Wakhlu, let me ask y’all some questions. Have you lived in a lower socioeconomic setting, like I have? Do you know what the culture and the schools are like over there in the hood? I do. I am a product of the LAUSD up until 6th grade. Then after that, I attended some “privileged,” predominately white and E Asian, middle and high schools. I know firsthand, how the kids act at LAUSD. And the way you describe the “unfair” advantages that schools in the suburb receive is complete bullshit. If you provide the tools and resources to students in “disadvantaged” communities, do you honestly believe they will take advantage of them??
Get off the liberal activism bandwagon. Y’all got it twisted. No street cred, no hood pass for y’all. It’s all just conjecture and incessant “blame the system; it’s racist” bullshit…..If a black or brown person wrote this article, which I presume you two aren’t, I wouldn’t put you on blast. You try too hard.

USG Vice President Austin Dunn and his running mate Morgan Monahan did not attend the event. Another ticket, consisting of USG Senator Daniel Million and his running mate Tim Vorhoff, also did not attend the event. 
USG Senate candidates were present for the event, along with USG presidential candidate Rachel Udabe and her running mate Rebecca Harbeck. The candidates started the event by introducing themselves and giving a brief explanation of their platforms. They then described the issues that mattered to them the most.
Blake Ackerman, a freshman majoring in business administration and is running on a ticket with fellow senatorial candidates Debbie Lee and Noah Silver, said he would like to see the greek community merge with rest of the University. 
“I know it’s very tense sometimes, and I want to help diffuse that tension,” he said. 
Ackerman then underscored the contributions of younger students within the University. 
“Freshmen are the future,” he said. “I’m a freshman, and I’m thinking ahead.”
Preston Fregia, a sophomore majoring in political science and also running for USG Senate, said he was passionate about making college more affordable. 
“The main reason I’m running is because of tuition,” Fregia said. “I am really focused on students being able to pay for school, especially low-income students.” 
Senate candidate Natalie Antounian, a junior majoring in political science and international relations, said she is running as a voice for student commuters who have a rough time socializing and becoming part of the campus community. 
“As a commuter myself, I know my fellow commuter peers have trouble coming into their social bubble,” she said. 
Antounian plans to advocate for a lounge area where commuters can socialize and rest during long gaps between classes, a time when students who live close to campus would likely be able to go home.
Attendees of the event asked how candidates planned on increasing student engagement in campus government and combating apathy in the student body. 
Tyler Matheson, the only current USG Senator running for re-election, said holding candidates in elected office accountable is crucial for students to believe that voting matters.   
“A culture of apathy is created when a student votes for an elected official and [the student’s] effort is not rewarded with an outcome from that official,” Matheson said.
Matheson stated that more accountability for USG officials in the next semester and coming years will demonstrate that students are actually voting for change. 
“We do get paid, and this is a job,” he said. “I expect us to serve the student body as such.”
Fregia ultimately underscored the role of USG on campus, saying that there was not much more the organization could do to motivate increased student involvement.
“USG has done an excellent job getting people involved,” Fregia said. “If people aren’t getting involved, then that’s also their choice.”
