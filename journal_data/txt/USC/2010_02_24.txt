It’s been a freefall over the last month for the former No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team and the Trojans couldn’t do much to stop that last night.
Strong effort · Junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy led the Trojans with 25 kills during the Trojans’ tough 3-1 loss to Cal State Northridge. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
“We embarrassed the university and the athletic department tonight,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “I was going to say something about nobody coming to watch us and I can see why right now. I don’t know why anyone would come to watch us.”
No. 6 USC (8-6, 5-4 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation), lost its fifth match in the last seven games last night when it was picked apart by No. 5 Cal State Northridge 3-1 (30-25, 24-30, 30-22, 30-21).
Aside from the second set, USC was never really in the match. CSUN, who won for the 16th straight time against the Trojans, had eight point leads in the middle of both the third and fourth sets, and USC was never able to recover.
“It’s lack of effort, lack of focus, lack of heart,” Ferguson said.
After winning the second set, it looked like USC was ready to turn the match around. But the Matadors built up a 19-10 lead. The Trojans were able to cut that lead in half, to 20-16, but just as they seemed to do done all night, the Trojans served into the net to halt their momentum.
“We definitely ended a lot of our own momentum tonight, whether it was a bad pass or bad serve after a big run,” junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy said.
USC also was unable to get anything going on the offensive end. The Trojans had a .043 hitting percentage in the first set and a .156 hitting percentage for the entire match. It seemed like almost everytime Troy and sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli went for a kill, a Matador was waiting on the other side of the net to dig it.
“I was not happy with any phase of what we were doing, other than the fact that our uniforms were clean and we matched,” Ferguson said. “We can’t play offense to save our life right now.”
One area USC is struggling at is the second outside hitter position, complimenting Ciarelli. Junior Tri Bourne started the season in the position, but injuries during the fall impeded his progress, and has since been pulled for freshman Maddison McKibbin.
McKibbin started his second game last night but had trouble early, especially in the first set when he posted a -.400 hitting percentage. He was able to find some kills later in the match, but still finished with a -.142 hitting percentage. Despite his struggles, Ferguson opted to leave him in the match.
“Part of his problems statistically happened at the beginning. He got about three or four poor sets at the beginning of the match,” Ferguson said. “Part of [the reason I kept him in there] was his passing. But Maddison’s still trying to find his way.”
He’s not alone. The Trojans are searching for their way as well.
Dear Mikex,
I feel your disappointment with R Team.  However, this is the same coach and team [-Luke at libero]
who ran the table in the MPSF and beat defending champ PSU in semi final
and lost thrilling 5 set match to UCI.
Coach Ferguson is a very good coach.
Mick Haley has won multiple NCAA’s with Taxes and USC.
Sure the coaches have to take some of the blame….
I am also embarrassed we lost twice to PEP & 16 in row to csun….
and 5 0f last 7.  I Just got back from Olympics….
I will be at Galen for rest of home games and for many
road games also.
I firmly believe that we will find our stride and battle back .
I am sad we will not be hosting the final four of MPSF
because our record ia only 5-4 at present.
Keep the faith my dart throwing friend and take a sip form the glass half full.
Troy will rebound…led by Murphy Troy, Tony, Hunter, Austin,
Riley & Maddy…….the libero has talent and will also rise up…
you watch…don not count us out..  FIGHT ON
Ferguson is a joke of a coach.  His offense is too predictable and VERY SLOW.  This team needs a coach who can get the guys to play at their maximum potential.  Murphy is not an opposite.  He can’t hit with power from that side.  Madison not an outside.. He hits better as a leftie on the right side and Ferguson is too dumb to figure it out.  He is ruining the careers of so many talented players who could have gone anywhere and excelled.  This team has two players who considered the number one recruit in the nation and yet they look like crap on offense.  
ferguson is a club coach and why he was hired at  a school with tradition is beyond me.  USC will always be an underachiever as long as he is the coach.  As far as attendence goes it has always sucked so I don’t see why that’s even worth bringing up.  This team plays a very boring slow offense.  The same slow crap that Mick haley runs with the women’s team.  I guess he is Ferguson’s mentor..
Agree with Coach Ferguson first about no one coming to watch the match, and second it was an embarrassment to the fight on motto of the university. Playing better on the road at least taking the match to five sets twice and even beating the bruins while at home being swept by Pepperdine and winning only once against Stanford and CSUN. A disgrace losing sixteen in a row to the Matadors! Just my observation is the libero position is down a lot from last season with Luke Morris graduating whereas the new guy Pizula has a number of balls get by him or are misplayed. Too many mental errors with kills and serves. The coaching staff has to take some of the blame for not preparing the team especially for the second matches of the season vs. the same opponent.

With the release of its eleventh studio album Who Killed Sgt. Pepper, the Brian Jonestown Massacre has reinvented its sound once again.
The one · For Brian Jonestown Massacre’s 11th studio album, the band incorporated electronica, shoegaze and Middle Eastern sounds. - Photo courtesy of A Records 
Throughout its nearly two-decade existence, the band has produced a diverse catalogue of albums crossing genres from folk rock to shoegaze to noise pop, all the while maintaining its authentic ’60s psychedelic aesthetic. Perhaps the band’s musical diversity is a reflection of its inner workings. Ever since its formation in 1990, the group has shuffled through more than 25 different members — enough people to fill the roster of a baseball team.
Despite the near constant change, however, the band has had one from the start: front man Anton Newcombe. A controversial figure, Newcombe was portrayed in the 2004 film DiG! — a documentary following the Brian Jonestown Massacre and fellow rockers The Dandy Warhols — as an egotistical, drug-addicted musical genius.
The most noteworthy scene was an on-stage scuffle during an industry showcase at the Viper Room in which the concert ended with bloodied noses, battered band members and no record deal, all because of Newcombe’s inability to collaborate with his band. Nevertheless, Newcombe remains a man with high ambitions and great expectations for his music.
With Who Killed Sgt. Pepper, the Brian Jonestown Massacre embarks on its most multi-cultured album to date. The opening track, “Tempo 116.7 (Reaching For Dangerous Levels Of Sobriety),” is an instrumental tune, meshing electronic sounds with exotic instruments. The song features ambient Bhangra beats and eastern European influences, evoking visualizations of a distant land, as if to transport the listener to the Punjab region of India. Straight from the beginning, the densely layered sonic landscape on this track sets the tone for the rest of the album.
The very next track, “Tunger Hnifur,” charges forward with a driving pulse that will have listeners stomping their feet. The ruthless nature of the song is accentuated by its aggressively throbbing beat mixed with Newcombe’s distorted vocals, which render the lyrics nearly indiscernible.
During the chorus, the band unleashes roaring guitar-fuzz and powerful cymbal-splashing that brings a new high to the song’s level of intensity. With all the underlying guitar licks and screaming vocals, this song deserves — and can only be fully appreciated with — the volume up to 10.
After the album’s strong opening, the energy flags in the following two tracks. “Let’s Go Fucking Mental,” a lackluster tune with an overused hook, represents the album’s main flaw: too much repetition. The anthemic, slightly meandering chorus lacks variation and comes across as rather dull.
“White Music” does nothing to salvage the album’s flow in the wake of its predecessor. With ambient swells and echoing vocals, this tiresome two-and-a-half-minute experimentation will potentially turn off listeners. It functions as little more than album filler between more memorable songs.
Fortunately, the next track, “This Is the First of Your Last Warnings,” begins to build up the album’s momentum again. The catchy tune features an infectious beat complemented by crunchy guitar distortion — it’s easily the highlight of the album. Textures of Middle Eastern-influenced vocals in the background and sampled percussive beats permeate the rich recording.
The ethereal vocals of Icelandic artist Unnur Andrea Einarsdottir spruce up what is already an absorbing song. Introduced nearly two minutes into the track, Einarsdottir’s nourishing harmonies elicit visualizations and feelings like a thin blanket of silk over the atmospheric synthesizers.
The Brian Jonestown Massacre’s characteristically raw sound is emphasized in “Our Time,” a shoegaze-influenced, post-punk revival song. The glistening drone of the guitars coupled with the soft and airy vocals make for great listening on a dazed summer day in the suburbs. While it maintains the hypnotic quality, this song lacks the aggressiveness that characterizes the rest of the album. It makes for a pleasant deviation from the norm and adds much-needed diversity to the record.
Although Who Killed Sgt. Pepper’s prospects of commercial success might not be the greatest, alternative rock fans will likely celebrate the album as an innovative collection of songs that eclectically mesh various musical elements ranging from shoegaze to Eastern-influenced electronica.
While many original followers of the Brian Jonestown Massacre will undoubtedly dismiss the new album as one that lacks the group’s distinguishing qualities, others will welcome the new sound as a natural evolution in the band’s music.
Like a hot bacon sandwhich with pineapple and banana.

Championship season is finally here and the No. 9 USC women’s swimming and diving team is fired up and ready to go.
The Women of Troy ended their dual meet season on a high note last weekend at UCLA, where they crushed the Bruins 164.5 to 135.5.
“Everyone is really excited and ready to race,” senior co-captain Krissy Forelli said. “We think with some big swims we can be contending for Pac-10 champs.”
Wednesday marked the opening night of the 2010 Pac-10 Women’s Swimming Championship at the Belmont Plaza Olympic Pool in Long Beach, Calif. The four-day competition will present many challenges for the Women of Troy (11-2, 4-2), who will be facing powerful Pac-10 rivals such as No. 2 Arizona, No. 4 Stanford and No. 5 California.
“I think we will battle to move into the top three, but we are going to need outstanding relay performances,” USC coach Dave Salo said.
The USC medley relay team has usually been the Women of Troy’s secret weapon when it came to starting off any dual or championship meet. It was previously made up of graduating seniors Kristen Lahey, Rebecca Soni, Katy Houston and Rachael Waller. But now with an entirely new and young relay team, the conference is waiting to see if these USC swimmers can deliver.
“Currently, we are ranked fourth in each of the five relays being contested,” Salo said. “We are going to need to break into the top three in a couple of the relays to move up.”
The team will be led into the Pac-10 championships by All-American juniors Lyndsay DePaul and Presley Bard, as well as All-American sophomore Katinka Hosszu. The team’s general depth, however, is something that Salo believes will give them the edge.
“We have a strong squad that will not be reliant on just one particular individual,” Salo said.
Competing with seven more athletes than on last year’s Pac-10 team, the Women of Troy are expecting great things from themselves and each other.
“We are ready to take down whoever gets in our way,” senior co-captain Dina Hegazy said. “We’re here to win.”
This year’s incoming freshmen have added substantial strength to the program, including Haley Anderson, who has rarely lost a distance event for the Trojans this season, and sprinting star Christel Simms, who is looking to make a memorable Pac-10 debut.
“We’re definitely getting stronger as a program and everyone will see that this week,” Forelli said.
The butterfly events will be a key event for the Women of Troy, who sport four of the nation’s top athletes in both the 100-yard and 200-yard fly. One is Hosszu, who ranks third in the event. She competed for Hungary in the Fédération Internationale de Natation World Championships in the summer of 2009 and was Hungary’s Female Swimmer of the Year. Hosszu is followed closely by sophomore Tanya Krisman, who is ranked sixth.
Freshman Yumi So has proved herself time and time again in the butterfly events this season and will be looking to improve upon her two NCAA consideration times in both the 100-yard (53.71) and 200-yard (1:58.88).
Meanwhile, up at the Weyerhaeuser King County Aquatics Center in Federal Way, Wash., USC’s divers will compete in the diving portion of the Pac-10 championships.
Sophomore Victoria Ishimatsu will be looking to continue her winning streak after taking home gold in the 3-meter at last year’s Pac-10 championships.
Another key player will be 2008 Olympian freshman Ariel Rittenhouse, who will be challenging Ishimatsu for this year’s Pac-10 title. Sophomore Michela Fossati-Bellani will be attempting to qualify for her first Pac-10 final after a strong season.
“We are also going to be helped by an outstanding group of divers,” Salo said. “Rittenhouse and Ishimatsu will provide us strong performances that could move us into the top three at Pac-10 overall.”
The competition runs until Saturday in both the swimming and diving events.

After an encouraging 15-5 victory over No. 11 UC Irvine last weekend, the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team (6-1) will kick off Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play with a matchup against  No. 6 Hawai’i tonight at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
Fine tuning · Senior utility Forel Davies and the Women of Troy have seen their defense improve but know more tweaks are necessary. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
Despite its top-10 ranking, the Rainbow Wahine have had their fair share of struggles early on this season, making the Women of Troy the odds-on favorites to win their conference opener. Thus far, Hawai’i remains just one game over .500 in addition to going just 1-3 at the Stanford Invitational and losing at California in its MPSF opener earlier this month.
Despite holding a 29-3 all-time mark against the Rainbow Wahine, including an ongoing streak of seven consecutive wins, USC does not anticipate overlooking anybody this season.
“Hawai’i can have a down game but also come out really strong,” said senior utility Forel Davies, who is second on the team with nine goals. “We understand that from playing them in the past, where we’ve beaten them by a lot but then had a close game. So no matter what, we can’t underestimate our opponent and have to come out strong knowing they’re a good team.”
Even with its inconsistency, Hawai’i does feature one of the nation’s top scorers in attacker Monika Eggens, who leads the team with 19 goals early in the 2010 season.
Although Hawai’i might be proficient on the offensive end in its own right, the Women of Troy, through just seven games, have also shown the offensive balance needed to compete with the best in the country.
“There’s been a lot of focus on the team thus far,” Davies said. “We just want to set each other up, and we’ve really been focusing on that in practice. It’s fun to have a lot of girls score and see the whole team play well.”
As usual with USC coach Jovan Vavic, defense will be the primary focus for the Women of Troy.
After Vavic said the defensive performance against Loyola Marymount in the team’s home opener “sucked,” the Women of Troy fared much better defensively last week against UC Irvine. But the team is still looking to fine-tune some of its lagging issues.
“There is still a lot to work on defensively,” Davies said. “Offense wins games but defense wins championships. That’s what we want to win — a championship. I think last week’s performance was a little better than the LMU game, but there is still a lot we need to work on.”

When the USC men’s basketball team plays its final home game of the regular season Saturday against Oregon State, it will be the last time that three seniors take the floor at the Galen Center.
There will undoubtedly be a pleasant celebration to honor the contributions that the departing players made to the program during their time in Los Angeles. But if the school really wanted to pay tribute to the trio, it would dole out an apology.
These players — Mike Gerrity, Marcus Johnson and Dwight Lewis — essentially took the fall for someone else’s mistake. None of them will get a shot to play in the Pac-10 tournament or the NCAA tournament because of self-imposed sanctions stemming from the O.J. Mayo scandal.
That’s not to say that USC basketball didn’t need to be reprimanded. If the school found the program committed violations — even if it conveniently won’t specify exactly what those violations were — then the team surely deserves to pay for its transgressions. But with the limited reach of justice in college athletics, it’s unfortunate these three seniors had to pay when some of the guilty parties have skipped town.
And it’s hard to think of more innocent people than those who were actually affected.
The story of Gerrity’s unlikely path to USC seemed like it might have a fitting end with the possibility of a postseason run, but instead it will end abruptly when the Trojans close out their season next week against Arizona. Can someone at least refund him that semester’s worth of tuition he had to pay before he got his scholarship?
Johnson not only gave USC basketball some much-needed highlight moments in the last two seasons, but he also showed remarkable willpower. After initially declaring for the NBA draft and appearing to be the latest part of USC’s basketball exodus, Johnson stuck it out for his senior year and came back to a team in transition. But maybe it was all worth it if Johnson can parlay this year into a better shot at the NBA.
And Lewis might be the most well-versed of anyone in the ongoing drama that is USC basketball. The three-year starter has overseen some of the most prosperous — yet tumultuous — stretches in the program’s history. Through it all, he has played the role of good soldier despite having to deal with some animated personalities.
In all, the seniors have every right to be upset with the hand they were dealt. But to their credit, it wouldn’t be their style to complain about the circumstances.
“When the whole sanction thing came down, I said that the last thing we would do is talk about it,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said in his weekly conference call. “Our guys have been great in terms of how they’ve carried themselves throughout this.”
It feels odd to have a team that is so low on ego must suffer for the sins of its unpunished predecessors. And not having a shot to play in the conference tournament is a pretty big blow.
Last year’s unexpected tournament run was like a three-day party at the Staples Center. The Trojans suddenly looked rejuvenated and joyful, a stark difference from the team that ended the regular season so business-like.
Of course, there’s no guarantee that the Trojans would even be candidates for an NCAA tournament berth with their current record. Trying to determine how the season would have played out differently would be a fruitless task, and the team’s current record doesn’t ensure anything. But last year’s team looked dead in the water before it secured its space via automatic bid.
And it sure would have been fun to see what those three seniors could have done in their last stand.

After opening with four straight wins in the month of February, the USC men’s basketball team rolled into Pullman, Wash., last Saturday only to have its streak snapped in a 51-47 loss to Washington State.
Another shot · Senior forward Marcus Johnson scored just five points in the Trojans’ 10-point loss to Oregon earlier this season. Johnson will look to improve upon his 2 of 10 shooting during tonight’s rematch. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
“We had won four in a row, and you know how that goes,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “Human nature, at every level — players soften up a little bit.”
The Trojans (16-10, 8-6) look to bounce back tonight against Oregon at the Galen Center. With just four games remaining in the season because of self-imposed sanctions, a victory against the Ducks (12-14, 4-10) takes on heightened importance.
The way O’Neill sees it, the team has “eight hours of basketball left to play.”
But even without the prospect of the postseason, USC has a little more at stake. Just a game and a half out of first place in the Pac-10, the Trojans still have a shot at capturing the conference regular season title.
“It’s been a goal of ours from the beginning,” O’Neill said. “That’s the only thing we can play for at this point.”
To achieve that goal, the Trojans first have to get past an Oregon squad that sits in last place in the Pac-10 but still got the best of the teams’ Jan. 30 meeting at McArthur Court. There, the Ducks took advantage of a technical foul called on USC student manager Stan Holt late in the game and shot 50 percent from the field on their way to a        67-57 victory.
Oregon will be hard-pressed to come up with a similar performance tonight. The Galen Center has proved to be a tough venue for visitors, as the Trojans have won 30 of their last 35 home games.
USC also boasts a significant size advantage down low. While Oregon forward Jeremy Jacob is the Ducks’ tallest starter at 6-foot-8, the Trojans counter with 6-foot-9 redshirt junior forward Alex Stepheson and 6-foot-10 sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic.
But that duo failed to deliver in USC’s recent loss to Oregon. Stepheson finished with zero points, and most of Vucevic’s 10 points and 14 rebounds did not come until late in the second half. Meanwhile, Jacob had a career-high 19 points and guard Malcolm Armstead added 18 points for the Ducks.
With a team that is ranked second to last in the conference in scoring at 59.5 points per game, the Trojans will need to get more production from their frontcourt. But as has been the case all season, one can expect USC to rely on its suffocating defense, led by senior guard Dwight Lewis.
“I think Dwight has become a really good — I guess I could call him a great — player and defender,” O’Neill said of Lewis, who on Saturday held Washington State star Klay Thompson to a career-low two points. “He’s faced whoever is the best player almost every game and done a magnificent job.”
Tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.

After snapping a five-game losing streak with a win over the Washington Huskies, the USC women’s basketball team hopes it can carry some of that momentum heading into its final road trip of the year.
Up next for the Women of Troy (14-11, 8-6) is a game with the Oregon Ducks, who managed to come to the Galen Center and steal a road victory in the team’s last meeting. With the Pac-10 conference regular season winding down and a NCAA tournament bid at stake, the Women of Troy understand they have business to take care of.
“We need to be focused.  We have to play the first 20 minutes just as hard as the last 20 minutes,” senior guard/forward Aarika Hughes said.
Playing hard the entire game will be important, but containing Oregon’s lethal offensive attack will be key as well. The Ducks (16-10, 7-7) have four starters averaging double figures in scoring, and they are the second-highest scoring team in the nation, averaging almost 84 points per contest.
In the last meeting between the teams, the Ducks scored 85 points and senior guard Taylor Lilley set an Oregon single-game record by hitting nine 3-point baskets en route to 36 points.
“We’re going to have to get a hand up in her face because Lilley can shoot it from anywhere,” Hughes said.  “We have to contain [Oregon’s] dribble penetration and keep the ball in front of us.”
In the second game of their road trip, the Women of Troy will face the Oregon State Beavers (9-16, 1-13), who occupy last place in the Pac-10 standings. But the Women of Troy know they cannot overlook any opponent this late in the season, as evidenced by their 12-point loss to then-last place Washington State Cougars.
“We’re taking it one game at a time,” USC associate head coach Ervin Monier said.  “We’ll try to take Oregon first, and then we’ll give some attention to Oregon State.”
Though the Women of Troy handily defeated the Beavers by 27 points in the last meeting, there will still be changes in their game plan to try and improve on their play.
“It’s a game of adjustments… we’re trying to make the adjustment to be better and do what it is that we need to do,” Monier said.
Going on the road won’t be easy for the Women of Troy, but team members said they are confident they’ll be able to find a way to tune out everything else and focus on the task at hand.
“We have to act like the crowd is cheering for us,” Monier said. “We’ve been pretty decent on the road so far, so we’ll treat [these games] like home games.”
Thursday’s tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m.

It seems like every time you go online there’s a new website advertising the next must-have service. Some are aimed at niche interests, while others try to revolutionize the way everyday needs are met.
The other day I came across such a website, Twitpay.me. Advertising “payments in 140 characters or less,” Twitpay.me is a Twitter add-on that links users’ Twitter and PayPal accounts, allowing users to make payments via reply Tweets. It’s a simple, easy way to settle a debt, take care of monthly bills or transfer money online, and it represents a very innovative combination of two already popular websites. For better or for worse, however, Twitpay.me is only one part of a growing trend of the digitalization of life in general.
These days it’s hard to find an action or task that doesn’t have some kind of online alternative. Everywhere we turn, there is a new website, iPhone application or Internet service promising to do what we’re accustomed to doing in person, only quicker and with less hassle. It’s a movement all across the Internet that aims to transition those chores and everyday interactions — which normally occur face-to-face — to the web.
This trend is in no way limited to online payment options. Most stores offer online purchasing and companies like Netflix recently began offering online streaming for movie rentals, eliminating the need to wait for a DVD to be delivered to the customer’s mailbox. There are websites where online shoppers can order groceries and have them delivered straight to their front door, and, since the advent of video chat services like Skype, even personal interaction has gone digital.
These are unique and interesting services, but the effect they’re having of moving things away from the real world and putting the focus of interaction on the online world is more than a little disconcerting. I have always been an advocate of using any and all tools available to enhance productivity, but recent advances beg the question, “How much is too much?”
There are some clear benefits to online alternatives. Does the local store not have the item you want? Check online; if it’s part of a store’s catalogue, it will be there. Need to talk to a friend who lives on the other side of the country? Why use a phone when you can video chat? The Internet simply offers options that are easier than their in-person alternatives.
On one hand, this digitalization of everyday life isn’t a bad thing — especially for college students. Between balancing classes, homework and clubs, there isn’t much time to go out and do some shopping or meet up with 10 different friends around Los Angeles. Having all of those needs met by a computer with Internet access is a lifesaver; these online alternatives give students the time they need to focus on school and work.
Yet web dependence is by no means a perfect solution for students. For one thing, this is not a universal movement. Compared to the majority of Internet users, the people using the online alternatives are a small group. It is simply a unique subculture. The rest of the world — especially institutions of power and influence — still rely on in-person, physical interaction and transactions. For the electronic minority, they may just be alienating themselves.
There is also a double-edged sword that comes with rampant Internet use among college students. While the web offers time-saving solutions to every day chores, it keeps us from learning a lot of real-life skills. Paying for things online and sticking to online financial services means less physical interaction with banks and stores. Kids coming into adulthood in this digital age aren’t learning the how-to skills and rules that go hand in hand with real world interactions. In a way, this generation is just being set up to fumble through every social situation it ever encounters in the real world.
However, this could just be the way things are heading. Progress always starts small, and the status quo takes time to change. The increasing inescapability of the Internet and social media has revolutionized how people interact. However, until sites like these are the norm, what’s to be done? Ultimately, we need to arrive at an amenable middle ground. Students can’t be completely reliant on the Internet if they hope to ever learn basic life skills. Yet, giving up on the tools the Internet provides would just be ludicrous.
Take advantage of what the Internet offers, but don’t grow dependent on it. Use it to free up some time and increase productivity, but don’t let it run your life. The Internet is a tool — not a way of life. We’re in college; we should be out trying new things and exploring the world around us.

It’s no wonder that Sasha Anawalt, the director of the USC Annenberg Arts Journalism Programs, introduced Tuesday night’s performer Savion Glover as “the greatest living tap dancer.” The statement proved to be truthful as Glover brought his show Bare Soundz to Bovard Auditorium, giving an explosive, emotive performance bursting at the seams with unbridled expressions of rhythm.
Hoofer · Without any musical accompaniment, Savion Glover’s Bare Soundz highlighted the percussive noises made by tap dancing.  - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Tap is a dance style that relies on percussion created by the dancer’s feet for its own rhythmic track. Sometimes, it is accompanied by music, but other times — as with Bare Soundz — the clacks need no accompaniment.
Unfortunately, in comparison to other dance styles such as jazz or hip-hop, tap has been overlooked by the mainstream.
But when well executed, tap can be just as progressive and exciting as other dance forms. Not only are the performers percussionists by default, they also work with the dynamics of movement to create what is unmistakably a dance form.
The movements often take second place to the execution of sound, but the actual dancing — choreographed or not — is consistent and meaningful. Glover, along with co-performers Maurice Chestnut and Marshall Davis Jr., proved Tuesday that tap is absolutely breathtaking as an art form at this elite level.
Before the event, the line outside Bovard snaked past the front entrance and walkway, curled south to the front of the Student Union Building, then twisted back on itself — a fitting showing of fans for Glover, a Tony Award-winning performer who also choreographed and danced the moves for Happy Feet.
For an act as complex as tap can be, the stage setup was surprisingly bare. Glover’s show used only three wooden platforms, and the first sound of steel taps on the wood was jarring. Louder and more assertive than expected, the tap rang out across the audience.
Then came the rest of the steps — sounds as complex as the drumming on a five-piece drum kit, all from two metal plates on the bottom of a pair of shoes.
Glover’s feet weaved bewildering polyrhythms through a background beat locked down by Chestnut and Davis.
The result was noisy in a positive way, and the full-impact stomping of heels and toes was intense enough to reverberate through the chest.
As the performance continued, variation was evident. One moment, Glover, Chestnut and Davis were spinning effortlessly in perfect, coordinated circles. Next, the three held their upper bodies still while the performers’ legs moved wildly in some otherworldly half-time like bullets from a machine gun. During solos, the performers truly let loose — feet flew in frenetic joy and calves quivered as if attempting to awaken a leg that had fallen asleep.
What took things to another level, however, was the technicality of the percussion created. The sounds were — without exaggeration — equal to the cadences of full drum lines, making it even more shocking was that there were no speakers spitting out anything prerecorded.
The similarities, in terms of sound, ability and intensity, between the tap dancers on stage and talented drummers of popular culture were clear, and Glover could have easily been Led Zeppelin’s drummer John Bonham ripping through the solo of “Moby Dick.” Though Glover was the star of the show, Chestnut and Davis also lived up to their reputations as prodigy tap dancers, taking turns answering Glover’s solos with their own intricate percussive lyricism.
A highlight of the performance was when Glover, Chestnut and Davis traded off solos on a single platform, eventually combining efforts to hit the climax of the number with all three cracking out a beautifully synchronized cadence in one line. The ending sequence of the show was an exhausting experience — a Niagara Falls-like flow of thunderous sound hammered down until silence finally reigned — until the equally thunderous sound of a packed house giving a gleeful standing ovation filled Bovard.
Bare Soundz was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that reaffirmed the greatness of Glover’s tap dancing. With such a spectacular performance, fans of dance can be reassured that, despite its obscurity compared to other styles, tap will live on. Glover lit up the stage with radiant smiles and flying feet, proving him worthy of candidacy for the title of “greatest living tap dancer.”
Savion Glover’s Bare Soundz was brought to USC by Visions and Voices: The USC Arts and Humanities Initiative. Tickets for this “once-in-a-lifetime” Visions and Voices Signature Event were free for USC students, faculty and staff.

KUSC, the Los Angeles radio station with uninterrupted classic music 24 hours a day, achieved two note-worthy accomplishments: topping the national public radio rankings and raising more than $1 million for the station.
“This marks the first time KUSC has been number one in two areas,” said station president Brenda Barnes in a statement.
KUSC 91.5 FM is the top public radio station in the country according to the most recent Arbitron ratings, which are based upon the average number of listeners who tune into the station during the week, LA Observed reported.
For the first time last spring KUSC beat out WNYC and KQED, the top public radio stations in New York City and San Francisco respectively.  The classical music station held its lead in the Arbitron rankings for the fall quarter 2009.
The classical music station was ranked 19th overall in the Los Angeles market for the last holiday season by Arbitron, a media and marketing research firm who measures local-market radio station audiences.  The research period was Dec. 10. 2009 to Jan. 6, 2010.
KUSC reached another record, topping 10,000 pledges during its winter membership drive, which brought in $1,123,869 for the station.
“KUSC is valued so highly by our listeners,” Barnes said in a press release.  “It feels like a great honor in economic times like these.”
The pledges come in from 38 states and 11 countries, reflecting support from Internet radio listeners, according to the station’s membership director, Carrie Banasky, who led the eight-day fundraising drive.
“It shows how far afield our membership has become,” she said in a statement.

Kenneth Koo, chairman and CEO of a prominent Hong Kong shipping company, has collaborated with the USC Viterbi School of Engineering to create an institute dedicated to fighting pollution caused by marine engine emissions, according to USC News.
Koo, who runs Tai Chong Cheang Steamship Co. (H.K.) Ltd, has pledged $4.1 million toward the creation of the Tai Chong Cheang Institute for Emissions Reduction from Marine Diesel Engines. The institute will focus on creating technology to reduce emissions and invent more efficient engines.
Koo said he believes that collaboration with USC will be beneficial in realizing his vision of reducing the shipping industry’s impact on the environment.
Faced with this vision, the new institute plans to research along two main paths. One will measure the differences between traditional engines and engines using new — possibly more efficient — transient plasma ignition technology.
The other would focus on producing small-scale prototype engine components that help reduce emissions of toxic pollutants. If successful, such prototypes would be made on a bigger scale and then tested with real engines.
“Our goal is to reverse, recover and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while also conserving fuel and reducing emissions harmful to health and the environment,” Koo said. “I believe we have a responsibility to be good stewards of the environment, and we are willing to do our part to reduce the impact on climate change caused by our ships.”
Viterbi Dean Yannis Yortsos said the engineering school is thrilled to be working with Koo.
“We applaud Kenneth Koo for his interest in conducting truly path-breaking research that could improve combustion efficiency while saving fuel and substantially reducing pollution. He is a real visionary,” Yortsos told USC News.

When the opening ceremonies for the 2010 Winter Olympic games started Friday night, I was antsy. Not for the stream of snow-capped athletes and Canadian-cultural sideshow, but for the premiere of the song and video for the charity cover “We Are the World.”
After two weeks of hype—and an L.A. Times at-the-recording-session tell-all to hold us through—the familiar twinkling slow jam finally came through the TV.
But with all the fixings of a postmodern Hollywood remake, the 7 minute-long self-aggrandizing montage crumbled under the weight of its own celebrity, proving how selfish entertainment has become in the last 25 years.
I know it’s counterproductive to criticize those who selflessly donated their time and voices to the cause (and especially to Lionel Ritchie who did everything in his power to bring back the energy of the original), but the new “We Are the World” is full of modern music stars who—forgetting that the song is about helping others—took it as an opportunity to showcase themselves.
Namely the rap artists involved, who you would have thought could drop the autotune-thug front for 30 seconds and record an honest Michael Jackson-pleasing chorus but instead chose to keep their signature style and give the World’s biggest selling single a tacky dose of voice effects.
Go Wyclef for stepping up as the musical ambassador to his home country and writing fresh, earthquake-themed lyrics for the rap bridge (which was also awkward—Snoop Dogg singing about love across the world?), but why weren’t there more lines (a la the original) sung by two artists? Having everyone in their own sound booths recording their solo over and over again gives a feeling of disjointedness, not unity and brotherhood.
The only time the whole group does sing together is during the chorus, but as the camera pans across the 85-strong array of entertainers, the scene looks a lot different than the one MJ and Ritchie gathered in ’85.
Back then, for one, all the celebrities looked like they were ready for a day in the recording studio. Decked in casual wear and oversized USA for Africa tshirts (or was that just the style in those days?), the participating celebrities swayed back and forth without a care to how their appearance would reflect on their career.
This time, though, hair and makeup teams ensured ladies such as Celine and Toni Braxton looked like singing porcelain dolls and everyone hungover from the Grammy’s the night before wore their favorite pair of sunglasses (I’m looking at you Fergie and Kanye).
While updating the song for modern times was a necessary move (thanks for letting Santana shred for a few seconds!), it inevitably absorbed some of the negative aspects of today’s celebrity culture and the video proves what the song implies—that nothing is truly selfless in the world of entertainment.

Can you imagine being suspended from school because of a comment you made on Twitter? Or dropped from a class for expressing your opinion on Facebook? These punishments might seem ludicrous to most, but students across the country have received similar sentences under the pretense of what school officials are considering libel.
Daily Trojan | Thomas Curry
The advent of social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace and Twitter has provided boundless forums for individuals to exercise their First Amendment right to free speech, but in the world of the classroom, where individual liberties are sometimes curtailed in order to maintain a functional learning environment, the Constitution’s application is called into question.
Courts have generally ruled that students and teachers maintain their constitutional rights both in and out of the classroom. In certain cases, however, judges have contested that, if a student’s conduct disrupts class work or threatens the rights of other students, that conduct is not protected by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.
This logic is derived from the Latin phrase in loco parentis, which basically means that, while a student is in the school’s custody, the school acts as a parent; therefore, students are not granted all the liberties afforded to adults.
This theory probably held up in simpler times, but the opportunity to express ourselves is now quite literally at our fingertips through blogs, texts, status updates and Tweets. So how can schools restrict student expression with this proliferation of platforms to instantaneously transmit information?
Magistrate Judge Barry Garber sought to unpack this loaded question after Katherine Evans, a former student at Pembroke Pines Charter High School in Miami, Fla., was suspended after using her home computer to create a Facebook page that complained about one of her teachers. According to a CNN article, the page was titled, “Ms. Sarah Phelps is the worst teacher I’ve ever met,” along with a description that read, “To those select students who have had the displeasure of having Ms. Sarah Phelps, or simply knowing her and her insane antics: Here is the place to express your feelings of hatred.”
Peter Bayer, the school’s former principal, suspended Evans for three days for “disruptive behavior and cyber bullying of a staff member … and removed her from Advanced Placement classes and assigned her to regular classes,” according to the CNN report.
Garber, however, found that the student had a constitutional right to express her views on the social networking site, saying “Evans’ speech falls under the wide umbrella of protected speech. It was an opinion of a student about a teacher that was published off-campus … was not lewd, vulgar, threatening or advocating illegal or dangerous behavior.”
Like Katherine Evans, an anonymous USC student made a Facebook group to discuss a professor who hosted a Writing 140 seminar given at Bovard Auditorium earlier this month. The page mentions the teacher’s alleged curious behavior at the seminar and calls into question her state of mind while on stage, suggesting that she might have been under the influence of alcohol.
This professor received a bachelor’s from UCLA, doctorate from Harvard, has published two books and co-founded the USC Center for Law and Philosophy, yet more than 50 comments have been left on this Facebook page mocking her performance, suggesting she be fired and overall defaming her character. This fan page — or slam page, rather — would meet all the criteria of libel if the claims were false.
As far as the comments read, it appears many students who attended this seminar agree that this professor acted bizarrely. But should they be free to express that opinion?
One might argue that this freedom of expression contributes to a lack of respect in the classroom, which hinders the education of students. On the other hand, perhaps these social networks are a new branch in educational institutions that will in fact promote a more democratic learning environment.
Social media give students a voice against a larger bureaucracy — the university. The Facebook page created by USC students is an example of a check on the balance between student and teacher. Yes, students should respect their professors, but this respect should flow both ways.
As students, we pay a hefty price to receive an education from this university, and these social media sites give us an opportunity to collectively comment on whether or not we are getting our money’s worth.
Information published on social networking sites can sometimes blur the line between freedom of speech and libel.
Hopefully, the courts will continue to recognize that the Constitution is a living and breathing document, which must be looked at through a magnifying glass to reflect our ever-changing society — a society in which social media networks are a new form of free speech.
Sara Escalante is a senior majoring in political science.
“The Constitution is a living and breathing document” is a code phrase that people use when they want to ignore or re-interpret the Constitution, and as Diane says, it isn’t necessary here. Free speech is free speech. However, I would remind you that the right to free speech is not a guarantee that you will have an audience, or a forum, or that you will be free of consequences for your speech. If the school in question is a public school, then there may be a Constitutional issue because it is effectively a government official punishing students for their speech. A university like USC should be free to create and enforce an “honor code” or something that does not allow public mockery of faculty and students. It’d be better for everyone if the rules were created in a transparent way and put into writing.
The decision does not require one to view the Constitution as a “living, breathing document.” The precedent is already there. Free speech is free speech. Whether it comes out of your mouth or out of your keyboard is entirely irrelevant.

Last weekend, my best friend came to town, and I wanted to show her around the USC area. I figured it was a perfect opportunity to check out L.A. Live and take advantage of the free weekend shuttle from The Lab.
After doing some research, I realized it actually was not an ideal activity because all the restaurants at L.A. Live would cost more than $20 per person, the Lucky Strike Lanes and Lounge would not admit us because the bowling alley only serves people over 21 after 7 p.m., and I was unimpressed by the selection of movies at Regal Cinemas.
To add insult to injury, Lucky Strike implements a strict dress code that prevents students from enjoying a casual outing to the bowling alley and charges $75 per lane for one hour (not including the $4.95 shoe fee).
Once my L.A. Live idea fell through, I could not find another safe, inexpensive, age-appropriate venue close by to visit on a moment’s notice. I preferred not to take my friend to Domino’s or Pasta Roma,  as those are generally my weekday dining choices, so I figured our best shot was to stay on campus or attend a party on The Row — again.
This was not the first weekend at USC that I could not find a suitable form of entertainment off campus.
Without an inexpensive and close assortment of activities within walking distance of campus, students are held hostage for the duration of the weekend.
Currently, the University Village offers an under par choice of weekend entertainment options. All I can think of is a slightly dilapidated movie theater and frozen yogurt bar. Students need more choices, and the UV is just the place that should provide weekend activities for them, such as a traditional bowling alley, movie theater, karaoke bar, pool hall or concert venue in which students can perform their original work. Weekend daytime establishments could include student-run art or dance lessons and a skating rink.
The UV has the potential to be an entertainment hub for students on the weekends because it is separated enough so students do not feel like they’re still at school. The venues could cater to both students and the community members and thus be more reasonably priced, unlike L.A. Live, which caters to working and wealthier Angelenos.
In addition to entertainment options, USC must also establish more reasonable grocery and dining options for students who are just beginning to live on their own and cannot differentiate an oven from a stove.
Grocery stores such as Vons, Albertsons and Trader Joe’s offer a huge selection of easy-to-prepare foods and frozen meals at low prices, perfect for college students. They also offer several different brands of each product so shoppers have the luxury of choosing one that suits them best.
Plus, several of those stores provide club cards that would allow students and local residents to save even more money on their groceries. Superior Grocers, which is currently located in the UV, does not provide an assortment of brands and is limited in its student-friendly products. USC can do better.
As a last necessity for students, the UV should include a larger pharmacy like CVS or Sav-On. The University Park Campus pharmacy has an insufficient selection of products that are only good for emergencies when students do not have the time to shop elsewhere. Many of its products are name brands and students are forced to pay more for medication and toiletries and cannot benefit from generic brands. The pharmacy at the UV is not much better than the one on campus.
The establishment of these stores and venues is imperative for students to truly enjoy and benefit from their experience at USC. The campus cannot be the only place students have to enjoy, and off campus venues would compliment the already wonderful weekday activities on campus.
So what is USC going to do about this? A ton, actually.
According to Kristina Raspe, associate senior vice president for real estate and asset management, USC is aware of these students’ needs. As part of USC’s Master Plan, the UV will open in 2014 with a full-service grocery store, like a Ralphs or Vons, and a large pharmacy like CVS or Walgreen’s. In addition, USC is considering opening a Trader Joe’s market because it would provide students with more grab-and-go meals and products.
The new UV will also have a bookstore and movie theater that specializes in art films like a Laemmle Theatre, Raspe said. It would differ from the Regal at L.A. Live because it would feature smaller productions as well as blockbuster films, although not necessarily on the first run. Raspe mentioned the theater would be “significantly” cheaper for students. Students will be able to watch movies and choose from a selection of different restaurants — both casual and formal — depending on the occasion.
In terms of small retailers, Raspe said USC would wait to decide which stores to put in the UV. She said stores are often “in one day and out the next,” and thus must be rented out closer to the opening date.
Other services or forms of entertainment such as a pool hall or skating rink are still lacking, but, with the restaurants, stores and theater coming to the new UV, students will have more to do off campus on weekends.
Thank goodness USC is finally in cahoots with its students and ready to implement changes that will directly affect them. Too bad I won’t be around to see it.
Danielle Nisimov is a sophomore majoring in public relations. Her column “On the SCene” runs Thursdays.
As a resident for over 30 years in the USC / North University Park neighborhood I have always been amazed at the lack of good retail services and non-fast food restaurants near campus where students could walk to. UCLA has affordable cinema’s, restaurant’s and even a Trader Joe’s just off campus and yet one of the most prestigious universities in the country (USC) has a pathetic offering for students who want something a little classier without breaking their bank account. The University of Washington which exists in a similar urban setting has a spectacular University Village Shopping Mall (www.uvillage.com) with retailers such as Eddie Bauer, The Apple Store, Jamba Juice, Starbucks and over a dozen cafes and restaurants plus dozens of retail outlets. The USC off campus retail experience pales in comparison.

Romeo’s new video makes debut appearance on BET
Remember Lil’ Romeo’s infamous song, “My Baby,” around the time we were all in elementary school? Oh, Romeo give me a kiss/ Uh uhh, chica, I don’t need a girlfriend!…
Well, that was the last time many people had heard of him – until Monday. USC student, Percy Miller, Jr., better known by his stage name Romeo, was featured in a new music video that made its premier on BET’s 106th & Park’s Top Ten countdown Monday evening.
The song, FootWork, by College Boyyz showcases many different variations of the popular Southern California dance move known as “jerking.” During the video, set in a college outdoor scene, many Greek-letter organizations are given shout outs.
Romeo, who is on the USC basketball team, has been focusing on his solo career in recent years. His last album was released in February 2009 without many noticing. He is currently planning to release an album in the upcoming months that will include some of his high school hits along with new songs featuring Akon and Bobby Valentino.
Bristol Palin makes her TV debut
We all knew it was coming. Bristol Palin, now known as the most well-known teenage mother in America, announced she will be making her TV debut on ABC Family’s The Secret Life of the American Teenager.
Palin, daughter of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, will play herself as a friend to the show’s main character who is dealing with an unexpected teenage pregnancy. Palin told ABC News that despite her mothers objection to participating in the TV show, she would go ahead with the offer.
“I am thrilled to be on this show and to be part of a program that educates teens and young adults about the consequences of teen pregnancy,” Palin said in a statement.
Bristol Palin was shoved into the national media landscape when her unexpected teenage pregnancy caused controversy around her mother’s vice-presidential campaign with Sen. John McCain.
Levi Johnston and Palin were engaged (said to have been pressured by the presidntal campaign), but have broken that off and are in the midst of settling for custody and child support earnings. Johnston, the child’s father, recently did a photo shoot for the online magazine Playgirl.
Wow! He’s sure changed since last seeing him on stage with the Palin troop last fall!
In case you missed it…
Television mogul, philanthropist, diva and chocolate-lover Oprah Winfrey transformed her entire set into pure Godiva chocolate this Monday. Yes, the whole set – edible. 800 boxes. 1,400 hours of physical labor. 15,000 individual pieces. The set, staged as a family living room, included chairs, books, tables, chess sets, a fireplace and flowers all made out of Godiva chocolate. That’s right. The most expensive chocolate anyone can buy, Oprah decided she wanted her whole set made out of it.
The Godiva chocolate stage, which was a part of a promotion for Godiva, was on Monday’s “That’s Incredible” episode. Also featured were the world’s fastest fiddle player, the tallest 16-year-old on the planet, the tallest dog, the child ‘Michelangelo’ of Etch-a-sketch, along with other things that would only excite Oprah.
It’s cute and cool, but what is Dr. Oz going to think about all? Isn’t Oprah always talking about healthy eating? I really think one morning Oprah woke up from a chocolate dream and summoned her staff to make this ‘chocolate stage day’ come to fruition. Ever since she announced the Oprah Show ending at the end of next season (season 25) she has been doing tons of random episodes.
Alright now Eric! Good stuff. I’m ready for lil Romeo’s album release and a chocolate set of my own!

Former Trojan fullback Mosi Tatupu died Tuesday at the age of 54.  The Plainview, Mass., fire department took him to the Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro, Mass., early Tuesday morning, where he died of undisclosed causes.
Born in Pago Pago, American Samoa, Tatupu attended Punahou high school in Hawaii, where he was a star running back.  During his time there, he set a state record with 3,367 rushing yards, a record that stood for 17 years.
A successful high school career brought him to USC, where Tatupu was a fullback on the 1974 National Championship team.  During his time with the Trojans, he rushed for 1,277 yards on 233 carries, an average of 5.73 yards per carry.  He was named USC’s Offensive Player of the Year and Most Inspirational Player in 1977, his senior season.  From 1997 to 2006 the Mosi Tatupu Award was given annually to college football’s best special teams player.
He went on to a 14 year career in the NFL.  His first 13 seasons were spent with the New England Patriots, who selected him in the eighth round of the 1978 NFL draft.  He was one of the teams most popular players and had his own cheering section, where the fans were known as “Mosi’s Mooses.”  He was named to the 1986 Pro Bowl as a special teams player and played in the Super Bowl the same season.  He retired as the NFL career leader in games played by a running back with 199.
Tatupu’s son, Lofa, played linebacker on the Trojans’ national championship teams in 2003 and 2004 and is now a Pro Bowl linebacker with the Seattle Seahawks.
Tatupu will be remembered for his hard-nosed play, whether it was running the ball, blocking for the ball carrier, or on special teams.  He will be missed by the Trojan Family.
My condolences to the Tatupu familly for the loss of such a young father.  Mosi sounds like he was a great leader and a good family man. Ron, thats a great story about aspects of Mosi people probably didnt know, he was a good student as well. What a great Trojan!
Very sad news about Mosi passing away at only 54 years old.  Although his football achievements were many and brought him notoriety, I remember him from an upper division engineering class we took together as USC students.  A few times we hung out after class and played backgammon. For such an aggressive workhorse, with calves bigger than my thighs, I got a kick out of his laid back mellow side.  A genuinely nice guy and a great Trojan.  My condolences to his family.

USC water polo coach Jovan Vavic announced the signing of six recruits for the class of 2010 on Tuesday, taking the team’s first step toward another national title.
The class comes after the Trojans have captured two national titles on the strength of veteran leadership. Both of the team’s most recent graduating classes left USC with 100 career victories and a national title to their names, but now the team will rely on a more youthful core.
Two recruits from Palos Verdes High School in Palos Verdes, Calif., two-meter/driver Riley Burke and goalie Paul Mitre lead the class.
Mitre was named last season’s California Interscholastic Federation Division IV Player of the Year during Palos Verdes’s run to the CIF-SS Division IV championship in 2009.
Two other first team All-CIF players will join Mitre and Burke at USC. Rex Butler of Coronado High School in Coronado, Calif., and Zach Lucas of Newport Harbor High School will help USC on the attack next season.
Loyola High School in Los Angeles also contributed two players to the newest signing class, including Nikola Vavic, son of the 16-year head coach. The left-handed Nikola has gained valuable experience playing for the U.S. Junior National Team at the recent Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA) Men’s Junior World Championships.
Two-meter/driver Jack Plaga also joins the Trojans out of Loyola as a strong two-meter defender.

USC’s Rossier School of Education was recently awarded the Best Practices Award for Innovative Use of Technology for its online Master of Arts in Teaching program, which lets educators earn a master’s degree online.
Educating · The Rossier School of Education earned an award for innovation thanks to its new online masters degree program. - Scott Fairbanks | Daily Trojan 
The prestigious award was presented by the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education and recognizes the innovative use of educational technology.
Karen Gallagher, dean of Rossier, said she was proud the school had earned the honor.
“We submitted work on MAT@USC, and when they looked at the technology and what we were doing with social networking they saw a combination of extraordinary use of multimedia,” she said. “There’s nothing like it.”
MAT@USC uses cutting-edge online technology to help train the next generation of teachers. The program utilizes online applications and incorporates interactive media.
Launched in June, the MAT@USC program is taught by full-time professors and is equipped with videos, chat rooms and lectures — all distributed online.
“It is very important that the program is seen as blended,” said Barbara Goen, the assistant dean for communications at Rossier. “There is the online program, but there is also hands-on course work. There are online lectures, but there is a human set of professors working to keep the program running.”
The program is a partnership between Rossier and 2tor Inc., a New York-based educational services company which provides the necessary technical aspect of the program and works to put the curriculum and material online.
Goen said she is pleased with how the program has grown in its first year and the national recognition it has earned.
“This is getting bigger all the time,” she said. “We have received wonderful feedback from students — a variety of students — from across the country.”
Gallagher said the award is recognition that USC has surpassed its peers in innovative teaching. Though she is pleased with the program as it is, she hopes the program will continue to grow.
“We’re not satisfied,” Gallagher said, noting that the school will continue to look at the program and find new and more innovative ways to improve it.

The weekly farmers market on University Avenue has yet to see an increase in sales since its move from Shrine Place, but with new sponsors and lower costs vendors are pleased with the overall situation.
Fresh fruit · The farmers market formerly located on Shrine Place is now on University Avenue because of the lower costs and better location. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
Steep rental costs from the Shrine Auditorium led USC and the Downtown Los Angeles Neighborhood Council to become co-sponsors of the new farmers market that relocated to University Avenue at the beginning of the semester.
USC and the neighborhood council helped the farmers market navigate negotiations with the Los Angeles County Department of Recreation and Parks and obtain its permit to operate on University Avenue, a public street.
The new spot “has a great walking street and is underutilized as a community space,” said Shawn Simons, the president of the Empowerment Congress North Area Neighborhood Development Council. “We helped get through the red tape to put the market there.”
The move was largely a result of the economy. The Shrine charged the market nearly $700 a month to rent its space, but the new location costs only $250 after the market obtained a permit from Recreation and Parks.
Simons said she heard the market was struggling and didn’t want it to disappear.
“By moving the location, [we’ve] allowed it to grow and have a chance to blossom in the area,” she said. “Its last location was a tighter space; the new one is much more visible.”
Although the new location hasn’t seen an immediate increase in traffic, the space, owned by the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks but maintained by the university, is expected to bring more students and customers to the market.
Helen Lee, the manager of the farmers market, said the biggest change and improvement was the shift in management.
“With USC and the neighborhood council sponsoring it [now], it kind of brings together the whole point of being here, which is to bring the whole community together with the college,” she said.
Though two of the market’s first three weeks at the new location were filled with rain, vendors said they are remaining optimistic.
“There are more cars in this location, more people know it is here,” said Leesa Choi, a Santa Monica College student who runs her mother’s produce stand.
Lee said it is still too early to tell if the market is faring better at its new location.
“Right now it’s hard to say — it’s very new,” she said. “Everything needs time.”
First time market-goer Katherine Cresto, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said she thought the new location was accessible and convenient.
“It’s a perfect break between classes and you don’t get fruit as fresh from Superior or Ralphs,” Cresto said.
A few vendors have dropped out since the market’s move, but some of the other vendors said they were happy about it because their rental fees have decreased.
“Now we can use the money that we put in for advertising, banners, things like that,” said Raul Arteaga, owner of R&L produce, one of the stands at the market.
Though students have said they enjoy the farmers market, Alicia Matsumoto, a junior majoring in communication, said she wasn’t sure about its future.
“I don’t know how many students actually stop. It seems like they mainly pass to go to class,” she said.
Lee has put up fliers before to bring more customers in, but she said money has been tighter recently. She and the market vendors are hoping customers will see the high white tents and come by out of curiosity.
Simons said she didn’t think the move would change the market too much.
“It won’t be too dramatic,” she said. “Anyone who went to it at the Shrine is still going to go to it at its new location.”
Lee said that she is concentrating on the individual vendors’ success.
“Whether they make more money or not, if [the vendors] are happier, it’s successful,” she said.

President of the Faculty Alex Capron pushed forward his vision of transforming USC into a “living university” at a retreat organized by the Academic Senate and the Office of the Provost in Huntington Beach this weekend.
Capron’s concept of The Living University is to engender an environment brimming with intellectual, artistic, cultural and educational opportunities that embraces and sustains a community of students, faculty and staff who live at or near the university. This community, he hopes, will radiate its lively energy to the university’s immediate environment, the city of Los Angeles and the West Coast at large.
This weekend’s retreat brought together approximately 80 faculty members and eight USC students to brainstorm ways to make Capron’s vision a reality.
The retreat featured eight brainstorming sessions that focused on either residential issues, community vibrancy, engaging the community or promoting a sustainable campus.
Attendees were divided into four different groups — one for each aspect of The Living University concept — and met once in the morning and again later for a second meeting focused on a different aspect in the afternoon.
Phillip Ehret, a senior majoring in psychology and one of the eight students invited to the retreat, said one of his break-out groups focused on building a more vibrant community on campus.
“There was a lot of talk centered around Visions and Voices,” Ehret said, referring to the university’s Arts & Humanities Initiative. “Right now, everyone goes, everyone leaves. Now, with the new campus center, they can have a place where students sit down with professors over coffee and cookies and continue those discussions outside of the venue, continue the thoughts and the learning that happened.”
Capron said the retreat was a successful first step in what will undoubtedly be a gradual process.
“This wasn’t a decision-making meeting,” Capron said. “There were lots of ideas, and some of them won’t work out.”
Ultimately, Capron’s major goal is fostering a stronger sense of community for USC students, faculty, alumni, and the surrounding neighborhoods.
Capron suggested that the great universities — places like Harvard, Yale and Princeton — place great emphasis on this relationship to their communities and community members.
He acknowledged this effort is more difficult because USC sits in a city rather than a university town, but Capron expressed excitement at the changes in the city scape around USC.
Capron acknowledged that USC, especially the University Park Campus, has made significant progress in the past two decades, evolving from a “commuter school” to one that provides housing for freshmen and sophomores in school-owned facilities with resident faculty and space for activities.
Capron further noted that USC is an increasingly vibrant place, pulsing with numerous productions, recitals, exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, concerts and other events by outside speakers and performers brought to the university by programs like Visions and Voices.
Expanding the Visions and Voices program was among the ideas presented at the retreat, Capron said.
“An idea that was put forward that got a lot of strong response was this concept of ‘Weekends at USC,’ where we’d be reaching out to faculty, students and alumni in a series of connected activities,” he said.
Capron also said he wants to build on the university’s increasing involvement in the community — improving schools, neighborhoods and public safety through student, faculty, staff and alumni efforts. Finally, Capron commented with pride that USC is making significant strides toward becoming a greener community.
“It’s further development of all the things that go on outside the classroom that add to the education of students,” Capron said. “By putting them all together, you help move the university forward more broadly. It’s an idea that’s linked to other things, part of the vision of what things could become.”
The participation of all members of the USC community is needed to make Capron’s vision a reality.
“It’s going to be a combined effort,” Ehret said. “Students have to put in the effort to communicate more, teachers have to put in the effort to communicate more. It’s great to see that the faculty has that willingness, now it’s about taking that potential and making it happen.”
Though realization of The Living University concept is a long way down the road — administrators have only just begun brainstorming potential steps — student participants at the retreat were inspired by this new vision for the university.
“I felt I was in the highest concentration of smart people I’ve ever been around,” said Collin Evans, a senior majoring in international relations. “USC has grown under President [Steven B.] Sample’s leadership. We’ve had great progress, but we’re not done if we want to be the Yale or the Harvard of Southern California.”

When administrators announced in November that the Von KleinSmid Library would remain a library and not be converted into music practice rooms as planned, most students celebrated.

But music students who had been eager to move into the new location were disappointed and, three months later, still do not know where they will be practicing come fall.
“We were all excited to get a new building,” said Daniel Weidlein, a sophomore majoring in jazz studies. “It seems like the entire music school kind of gets pushed off to the side when anyone wants something.”
The Thornton School of Music’s practice facility, the Music Practice and Instructional Center, is slated for demolition. The school had planned to move the practice rooms to the VKC facility, but administrators revoked the decision within a week of the announcement after staff and students petitioned to save the library.
Since then, the school has been searching for another option but with little success. According to Thornton Dean Robert Cutietta, several locations have been suggested, but all of the ideas have been vetoed because of physical constraints.
“Everything has to be soundproof, so finding places is difficult,” Cutietta said. “That’s why VKC was one of the first places to look at because it’s in the basement.”
PIC, which is located between Cromwell Field and the Intramural Sports Field, currently houses Thornton’s music practice rooms in addition to the jazz studies program, Thornton student advisement offices, a music computer lab and several other instrument labs.
Music students are still using the facility while the university searches for a new space, but many say the space is cramped and the number of practice rooms is insufficient.
“There’s too many music students for the number of practice rooms,” said Amber Navran, a sophomore majoring in jazz studies. “When it’s sunny, we can practice outside, but for piano majors what are you supposed to do?”
Robert Cooper, vice provost for planning and budget, said the university is working with Thornton to resolve the problem.
“We’re looking at options, and we’re trying to figure out the best solution for the school,” Cooper said.
Like many universities, the campus is in a “space crunch,” Cooper said, and with the huge campus center project in the middle of the university, “it’s a really complicated issue.”
Cutietta has big dreams for the music school but said at this point he simply wants to find a solution.
“I’d love to tear down all the music buildings and build an entire new music complex,” Cutietta said. “That’s a dream.”
Students are also dreaming of new facilities with more practice rooms, newer technology and more collaborative working spaces.
“I hope we move to a location that is convenient for all of the students, said Marcus Petitt, a freshman majoring in music industry.
Ideally, Petitt said, the move would also involve an upgrade in technology and resources.
The university hopes to have a decision about where they will move the music practice rooms by the end of March. Cooper said it is more likely they will move into a renovated space than into a brand new building.
Right now, though, the situation is changing constantly and students have expressed some frustration.
“It hasn’t been handled well because nobody knows what’s going on,” Weidlein said.
Cutietta said he will tell students as soon as any progress has been made, but currently the situation is too unstable.
“This has literally changed by the hour this whole semester,” Cutietta said. “As soon as we have something concrete, I’ll be sure to tell them.”
“I’d like to have this resolved, I’d like to know what’s going to happen,” he added.
The school has sent out e-mails to update students about all major decisions, but students are unsure about the progress of the situation.
One music student said he heard that PIC would become a welcome center for the football team. Another said he heard that PIC would be torn down and the Intramural Field would be extended.
Cutietta thinks two things are driving the rumors.
“The building we’re in is old and needs some major work,” Cutietta said. “And the university has wanted for a long time to do something with that area for athletics.”
Students said they believe the plan to convert PIC into an athletic building makes sense because of its location. But without the building, the students have no other space to practice their music.
“Just like scientists need laboratories, we as musicians need spaces to practice our music,” Petitt said.
Though students are worried about the future of their practice facilities, Cutietta emphasized that they will never be left without facilities.
“I wouldn’t be sleeping at night,” Cutietta said. “There is a solution, but we just have to find it.”

As a student at USC, Falicia Mandel was a consummate Trojan. She enjoyed the classes, the football and, more than anything, the camaraderie she shared with other students.
Now, she’s hoping that camaraderie can help save her father’s life.
Less than a year after her graduation last May, Mandel’s father, 60-year-old Joseph Mandel, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the blood cells. The condition requires him to receive a stem cell transplant, but none of his family members is a match.
In fact, matches are rare — only about one random person out of 20,000 will be a suitable donor. But Falicia is hoping one of the 35,000 students at USC could be the one.
A lifelong L.A. resident who works for JPMorgan Chase & Co., Joe will celebrate his 30th wedding anniversary this year and has two children, 22-year-old Falicia and 26-year-old Mark Mandel.
Since learning of the diagnosis, Falicia said she and her family have reached out to anyone they can find.
“I contacted everybody I could think of because it’s really life or death,” she said. “You can’t have any humility. You can’t be shy. The bottom line is my father has one year to find a match and receive a transplant. It’s so scary that the chance of finding a match is so slim.”
Joe’s relatives have been tested, but there is only a 25 percent chance a sibling’s stem cells will match. His older and younger sister match each other but not him, he said. His 91-year-old mother, a Holocaust survivor, cannot donate either.
Younger people, such as college students, make better donors because they are less likely to have health complications or previous surgeries, and transfusions of their cells are more likely to be successful, Joe said.
In the search for a match, Falicia said USC seemed like a natural place to turn.
“I had built a strong relationship with many students on campus,” she said. “There’s always this whole stress at USC that we’re a family. You’re a Bruin for four years but a Trojan for life. I felt if there was any way to get a large turnout it was through USC.
“Knowing the school and faculty and how students are … You see students fighting for each other every day, and that’s what I was looking for.”
Like his daughter, Joe is a staunch Trojan fan who said he never misses a football game on TV.
He said the response from USC has been tremendous.
“It’s so nice to see the Trojan family step up to the plate because there are others that have not,” he said.
Joe said he was impressed by the work his daughter has done to help find a match.
“It’s not an easy thing,” he said. “She’s doing everything in her power to be there for me and help to save my life.”
He also praised the school, both for welcoming his daughter and for supporting him.
“When Falicia went there the first semester, I saw the family that was there and said, ‘I sure wish I’d been able to go to a school like USC,’” said Joe, who attended Cal State Northridge.
Falicia arranged the drive through the City of Hope Cancer Center, where her father is being treated.
“Tell them the time, date and the place, and they just show up ready to do testing,” she said.
At USC, she has found support from organizations including USC Chabad, which will assist in organizing the drive.
“It’s important to be there and help in any way we can. She’s a member of our community,” said Rabbi Dov Wagner, the director of the Chabad Jewish Center. “The highest possible ideal is the opportunity to save a life.”
He said USC has held drives before but never for one individual.
“In the past, it wasn’t for anyone specific, just getting people into the registry,” he said. “Having a specific emphasis makes it that much more urgent.”
The drive will be held Wednesday and Thursday afternoons from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Trousdale Parkway.
Both the test and the donation itself are relatively minor procedures. The DNA is tested with a cheek swab, while a stem cell transfusion, which is similar to donating blood, can be done on the donor’s schedule.
“You get people who come up and go, ‘Nah, I don’t want to do it, I don’t want anyone cutting me open.’ But it’s not a surgery,” Joe said. “It’s painless for them. The effort for them is minimal, and they’re saving someone’s life. They may not be a match for me, but they could be a match for someone else.”
All tested students will go into a registry and could potentially assist others. While students with Eastern-European Jewish ancestry are more likely to be a match for Joe, other ethnic minorities are also underrepresented in the registry, making it hard for those patients to find transfusions.
“We have to do everything we can to find a match, if not for him, for someone else,” Wagner said. “It’s a great opportunity to help and show support that doesn’t cost anything.”
Joe said he hopes several hundred students will come but would appreciate if any students came to be tested.
“We’ve had other drives, and you get 40 to 50 people, but it’s 40 to 50 people we didn’t have before,” he said.
Falicia said she was grateful for the support she had already received.
“This is a very desperate situation for the entire family, and it’s easier to go through this situation knowing that very rarely do you have to beg someone to help you,” she said.
She urged students to take the time to get tested, saying that she would do the same.
“I would do it for them. I and my brother would do it for them. It’s really not a lot to do, and it’s something that is necessary,” she said. “We’re hoping there’s a match out there.”

Chris Cheng and Nehi Ogbevoen were declared the winners of the Undergraduate Student Government presidential election Tuesday, according to preliminary results.
Elected · Chris Cheng (right) is congratulated by Alex Bozzo, a junior majoring in political science and manager for Cheng’s campaign. Cheng, currently USG’s director of outreach, will be the next USG president with Nehi Ogbevoen as vice president. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
Cheng, a junior and USG’s current director of outreach, and Ogbevoen, also a junior, earned 2,100 votes — 45.3 percent of the total votes. They were followed by junior Dylan Dann, a current Greek senator, and junior Addison McCaleb, who earned 1,429 votes; junior Jonathan Munoz-Proulx and sophomore Ryan Walsh, who had 615 votes; and junior Andrew Matson, USG’s director of academic affairs, and sophomore Juan Orjuela, currently a residential senator, who earned 407 votes.
Cheng said he was “ecstatic” that his ticket won.
“We worked hard for every vote we got,” Cheng said. “We were out there for two weeks shaking people’s hands in the dining halls and on Trousdale. We didn’t really have any expectations; we just worked our hardest.”
Ogbevoen, who rushed to the Senate meeting from a basketball game to hear the results, was equally excited.
“It hasn’t hit me yet, it’s surreal,” Ogbevoen said. “In about 10 minutes, I’ll be screaming like a girl.”
Cheng and Ogbevoen credit their success to the amount of work they put into their campaign.
Munoz-Proulx said he wasn’t surprised by the results, adding that he is “very thrilled with the candidates that have been elected.”
Other candidates expressed similar views on the election.
“I think they’re going to lead USG with a lot of strength,” Matson said. “They’re really going to be able to connect with the students.”
USG Vice President Ashlie Chan said she was happy with this year’s election season.
“I’m really glad that the [voter] numbers have increased from last year,” Chan said. “I think the numbers reflect what the students want.”
Scott Hummel, co-director of elections and recruitment, said he was “impressed” by all the campaigns.
“They were all just really impressive students,” Hummel said. “They were all well-spoken, involved and interested in making USG better for USC students … These candidates bring to light how students should have the biggest say.”
Cheng and Ogbevoen are already making plans for the weeks before they take office. Among these tasks include building an “awesome and amazing” cabinet and talking to the administration, according to Cheng.
“We just want to start meeting with the administrators as soon as possible,” Cheng said. “We really want to fulfill all the promises that we’ve made. We’ve already met with the administrators beforehand, which was a huge help, and so we already established a good relationship with the administrators which I think is really important. So now we have to meet with them again and say, ‘Hey, we won so lets try to get this done for next year.’”
Ogbevoen also hopes to talk to the current USG president and vice president to gain insight from their experiences.
“I’ve done a lot of research in the past two months about the current administration” Ogbevoen said. “I really just want to dive in and talk to Ashlie Chan about being vice president and Holden Slusher and see what struggles they faced last year so that we can keep moving forward.”
During the campaign season, complaints were filed against Cheng and Ogbevoen for using the USG listserv to e-mail students. The elections commission ruled it a minor offense and ordered the ticket to remove 10 campaign signs from Trousdale Parkway. The other candidates brought the issue to the judicial board, which ruled that Cheng and Ogbevoen could not campaign until 3 p.m. on the third day of voting. No further action will be taken.
Co-director of Elections and Recruitment Emiko Suzuki said the whole election season went well and that it was a fair election.
“The atmosphere when the results were announced, everyone was still in good spirits and were all shaking everyone’s hands, and I think that shows that this was a good election and that nothing went terribly wrong and that nobody won by dirty means,” Suzuki said.
The official results of the presidential and senatorial races will be announced next Tuesday after the elected candidates have been determined to be in good standing and have completed their budget proposal.

Loyola Marymount had a tendency of giving up big innings in its first four games of the season, and in the bottom of the eighth inning USC made sure that continued in its 6-5 win Tuesday night.
The Trojans broke a 3-3 tie, taking advantage of a pair of free passes issued by left-handed pitcher Jason Wheeler. Wheeler faced only two batters, walking sophomore infielder Matthew Foat on four pitches and hitting Ricky Oropesa, also a sophomore infielder, with his sixth and final delivery.
After a sacrifice bunt attempt loaded the bases when reliever right-handed pitcher Chris Eusebio tried to force out a USC runner at third base, USC strung together a sacrifice fly and a pair of RBI singles by freshmen infielder Cade Kreuter and freshman catcher Richard Stock to take a 6-3 lead.
Senior Northern Iowa transfer and catcher Shuhei Fujiya collected his second win of the young season after completing the eighth inning. But Fujiya made it interesting in the ninth inning by giving up three hits and allowing two runs before USC coach Chad Kreuter went to the bullpen for junior pitcher Brett Williams.
“That’s college baseball,”  Kreuter said. “No lead is ever safe.”
With the tying run on third base only 90 feet away, the lead was just enough. Williams slammed shut the door needing only four pitches to strike out infielder Shon Roe to end the game.
Loyola Marymount scored the first run of the game without a hit, taking advantage of a pair of second-inning errors by Stock. After a catcher’s interference call and a sacrifice, outfielder Matt Lowenstein attempted to steal third base and waltzed home easily when Stock’s throw bounced into left field.
The Trojans responded in the third inning when senior outfielder Mike O’Neill hooked an 0-1 fastball down the line for a two-run homer that clanged off the foul pole.
The Lions would twice tie the ball game, but each time USC responded immediately.
After a Colton Plaia RBI double tied the game in the top of the fifth inning, the Lions handed USC a run when third baseman Shon Roe dropped a pop fly to the left side of the mound, allowing Foat to score from second base.
Playing a little small ball, LMU tied the game in the top of the eighth inning. Pinch hitter Jason Barmasse chopped a pitch off the plate for a single, was sacrificed to second and scored when Roe dribbled a single through the middle. But it was then that USC broke out its big inning.
“This is a different character of any other team [he has coached at USC],” Kreuter said. “There is a little battle, a little swagger to this team. They have a cocky confidence and don’t let the momentum sway.”
Neither starting pitcher figured into the decision. LMU’s sophomore left-handed pitcher John Lally pitched six innings, allowing three runs (two earned) on seven hits while Trojan sophomore pitcher Ben Mount was even more impressive.
The lanky, 6-foot-8 right-hander allowed only two hits and one earned run while striking out six Lions’ batters in his first career start pitching six strong innings.
“He pitched brilliant,” Kreuter said. “We had him on a pitch limit, but after he had such an easy fifth inning it was a no-brainer to push the limit back and put him back out for the sixth.”
