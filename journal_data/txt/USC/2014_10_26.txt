School of Cinematic Arts professor Alex McDowell and the 5D Institute hosted the seventh annual Science of Fiction Festival this weekend at SCA.
The conference focused on creating the fictional city of Rilao, a town that captures characteristics of both Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro. Festivities included an interactive musical performance, a conference that allowed people from different occupations and places around the world to collaborate in creating artifacts for the city and a multimedia exhibit built by students from McDowell’s world-building class.
McDowell began this project during the spring semester last year in his class IML 599, called Imagining Worlds -— Narrative Design Across Disciplines. His students researched different aspects of Rio and Los Angeles, from health to transportation to media culture. The students in his fall course curated the exhibit on display in the Interactive Media building.
The exhibit is a look at life in Rilao through the use of graphic design, technology, performing arts and storytelling. The history of Rilao is told via an Oculus. Kinect sensors cue sound effects as people walk by and 3-D graphics show what housing would look like in this city.
“All the projects in the exhibition are meant to be artifacts,” said Lauren Fenton, a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in the media arts and practice program. “The entire exhibition is meant to be like the fictional universe of Rilao.”
The class is diverse, with some students from the Viterbi School of Engineering and others from the Roski School of Fine Arts. The students range from undergraduates to Ph.D. candidates.
“The first semester, the project was to build the world, develop the world and write individual projects in the world,” McDowell said. “This semester, the project was to design an exhibit as if it were a narrative. How can you tell a complicated, multilayered narrative story about Rilao through the medium of an exhibition?”
The Sound of Fiction concert took place Friday night and starred Glen Matlock of the Sex Pistols, Slim Jim Phantom from Stray Cats and other musical guests, according to McDowell. Guests could determine the sound and lights of the concert via sound and image mapping in which the performers capture and modify audience sounds as part of the music, according to the School of Cinematic Arts.
Attendees on Saturday also saw a performance where students acted as researchers reporting their findings in studies of the fictitious region.
“We had a suite of cultural anthropologists come back from the island of Rilao, and they explained to us what they’ve been finding there and different details about the culture and its history,” said Tara McPherson, associate professor of media arts and practice at USC.
The conference culminated with each group presenting their artifacts to other participants.
“I work on market trends and product innovation research so I’m in a group that looks at how the market is going to evolve, how technology is going to influence people’s lives and change their attitude and behaviors potentially,” said Ioana Badea, who has been working at the Intel Corporation for 14 years.
“The students in this class have really turned the experience of the exhibition [in]to this game, this way of immersing people in Rilao,” Fenton said.
Students in the class were divided into three groups, with each group representing a different perspective developed by an organization on the island. Each perspective then analyzed each artifact and explained them through their point of view.
Other universities that collaborated on the world-building project included the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, Bauhaus University in Germany and the ESPM school of marketing in Brazil.
“It’s really great to collaborate with people from different countries and students from different countries,” Fenton said. “Everyone brought on their own particular lenses to the world of Rilao.”

UPDATE: Former student Kevin Valero was reported to have been found alive at approximately 6 p.m. Sunday night, according to the administrators of a community Facebook page set up to find him. An earlier version of this article reporting Valero as missing ran in Monday’s edition of the Daily Trojan.
Former USC student Kevin Valero went missing Friday afternoon according to Jorge-Mario Cabrera, director of communications and public relations at Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, where Valero worked for the past four years as a volunteer.
Missing · Kevin Valero (left), 21, was last seen on Friday afternoon. He studied political science and international relations at USC in 2012. – Photo courtesy of the Help Find Kevin Valero Facebook page
According to his friends and his Facebook page, Valero studied business administration and international relations at USC in 2012 and now studies political science at Citrus College.
Cabrera said Valero was last heard from around 1:30 p.m. on Friday.
“Around 1:10 he sent a text message to a friend,“ Cabrera said. “We do know that the contact was to a friend of his but there was no indication as to whether or not there was any foul play or he was concerned about anything. All we know is that he told his mother before leaving the house that he was going to go out with some friends.”
At approximately 1:30 p.m., Cabrera said Valero used an ATM and stopped at a Starbucks. Valero was scheduled to work that afternoon but never showed up.
Cabrera said the CHIRLA currently has about 50 volunteers searching throughout Southern California calling hospitals, jails and morgues and handing out fliers near where Valero was last seen.
The fliers describe Valero as 21-years-old, 5-foot-6, approximately 185 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes wearing a black shirt, black jeans and navy blue Nike shoes.
Cabrera said a police report was filed Saturday and the missing person flier said to contact the Covina Police Department, but as of Sunday afternoon the Daily Trojan found no record of a missing persons report.
Cabrera said CHIRLA is considering having a press conference Monday at 10 a.m. with Valero’s family.
Valero was also a member of the California Dream Network’s leadership team. The organization has posted on its Facebook page asking for information on his whereabouts.

Motivate & Empower held its second THINK conversation of the semester at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Friday. The conversation, entitled “A Discussion on Violence: We Are All Role Models,” centered on the heavy impact domestic violence has on society and, specifically, how the issue affects individuals on USC’s campus.
The conversation featured students and special guest speakers Wesley Jonathan, a film and television actor; Dr. Susan Evans, a domestic violence survivor and celebrity dermatologist; Chelsea Tavares, an actress from Make it or Break It; Judge Mablean Ephriam, a former Los Angeles prosecutor known for her television and film roles; and Cyrene Tankard, an actress from Thicker than Water.
Motivate & Empower is a leadership movement on campus that was founded on a threshold of three principles for students to uphold — THINK, REACT and CHANGE. The group has a variety of initiatives that allow students to gain a voice and express their vision. THINK, a component of Friday’s conversation, represented a platform in which students could safely share their ideas on the ways in which domestic violence is viewed.
M&E originated after Maya Carter, the group’s founder, shared a spoken word poem with students at an event hosted by Saved By Grace, a campus gospel choir. Students in the choir were interested in building on the issues at USC described in the poem and helped create M&E, according to Azmera Hammouri-Davis, vice president of student action for M&E.
According to the M&E website, in the year since it was founded, the organization has gained eight national university partners who now participate in the campus-based movement. About 20 to 30 students gather together during each THINK conversation to present their diverse views on prevalent social issues.
The THINK conversation began with members of the movement asking students to delineate their definitions of domestic violence on sticky notes, which were then arranged on a purple ribbon poster that represents Domestic Violence Awareness Month.
Attendees of the event were then seated in a large circle, and Hammouri-Davis opened up the conversation by speaking about Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Students set the stage for a powerful conversation by shouting their definition of domestic violence. Some words included in the discussion were hate, power, evil, fear, manipulation and physical harm.
Carter welcomed distinguished guests at the event and Hammouri-Davis followed by beginning the “step-forward” activity, which encouraged individuals to “step forward” from their seats in response to critical questions regarding domestic violence.
The room was silent as attendees took their seats and listened to the stories of students and special guests who directly or indirectly have been affected by domestic violence.
Following discussions in small groups, there was a period of time for all attendees to stand up and present ideas on ways to put an end to domestic violence.
The conversation identified both physical and mental domestic violence and discussed the ways in which culture has not only desensitized individual views on the issue, but also the ways in which society stigmatizes victims of domestic violence. Members of the group paid close attention to the various forms of domestic violence. Speakers went on to explain that domestic violence is not solely representative of the single-gender stereotypes seen in film.
Jonathan commented on the necessity for individuals to combat domestic violence.
“It’s an important issue that is never going to go away, and all we can do is try to minimize it and make sure that it does not continue and get passed on like a disease and not have our children view and see it,” he said.
Shana Douglass, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, felt that the discussion was a call to action.
“For me, the event provided some clarity as how I became desensitized to domestic violence in my own family and how I want to teach my brother and other children that is not okay,” Douglass said. “People need to call it out. When you see it, don’t just walk by it. You address it and say that is not how you treat this person, and if everyone does that, the culture will start to change.”

Since its release last week, the Revamp Lyon campaign and survey has received more than 700 student responses about the state of USC’s fitness and recreational spaces.
Launched by Undergraduate Student Government, the campaign aims to gather information about student experiences with the spaces and how they can be addressed.
By the second day of the campaign, the page had 750 likes. Having begun as a response to many complaints about the subpar state of the Lyon Center, Revamp Lyon was launched to help USG begin to outline the shortcomings of the Lyon Center and how they can be improved.
Headed primarily by Chandler Marcus, co-director of Wellness Affairs, and Darian Nourian, assistant director of Wellness Affairs and a staff writer for the Daily Trojan, the campaign hopes to generate dialogue on how recreational facilities can be improved before ideas are pitched to the administration.
The basis of this dialogue comes from Revamp Lyon’s online survey, which is offered through a link on its Facebook page. The survey is meant to collect student opinions on how well the university’s recreational facilities meet their needs and what could be better improved. The survey includes a section for students to leave more detailed comments on what should be done to improve the Lyon Center.
Students on the Facebook page have indicated that recreational facilities are important to them, and according to the survey, the Lyon Center is no longer meeting the needs of its students.
According to Marcus and Nourian, the Lyon Center was built in 1989, when USC was primarily a commuter campus. It was designed to accommodate 3,000 people. Since then, the university has grown in size, now boasting a student body of 18,000 undergraduate and 23,000 graduate students — many of whom still depend on the Lyon Center to be their main fitness facility.
Since that time, the facility has undergone only minor renovations, such as a change in the physical layout of the machines. But, according to the student survey responses this is not enough.
“Students complained most about overcrowding and broken machines, but things like the poor lighting situation also matter,” Nourian said. “The Lyon Center gives off an overall depressing mood, and it’s supposed to be this place where students come to de-stress. How are they supposed to do that in such a dreary environment?”
In spite of an array of different suggestions, students have complained that the Lyon Center’s largest issue is its lack of machines. According to Marcus, there is not enough room to add more equipment, so the only means of alleviating this problem is through an expansion of the Lyon Center or the addition of a new facility as a whole. Though a new recreational facility will be among the first tasks projected to take place in the building of the University Village, the space will likely be small in comparison to the Lyon Center.
But instead of waiting for the University Village, which is set to be completed in 2017, to add more breathing room, USG has a different idea: physically expand the building in which the Lyon Center is housed. Though there are currently no concrete plans as to how this would be done, there is a discussion around whether the building should be expanded vertically or horizontally. This would help alleviate the problem with space and would allow the Lyon Center to add more up-to-date equipment.
According to Nourian, 98 percent of the 718 responses gathered so far indicate that students support a renovation of the infrastructure and equipment of the Lyon Center.
Though no construction is currently planned, Marcus and Nourian are hard at work not only finding out what the students want, but also doing research into recreational facilities at other comparable institutions of higher education.
“We want to improve fitness here and make it a pride of USC students,” Marcus said. “You walk into the Campus Center and feel proud to go here. With the Lyon Center, that’s not the case.”
The two hope that the survey will generate responses from at least 2,500 students, and from there, they plan to take the students’ demands to administration members.

It was a confidence-boosting weekend for the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team. The Trojans (18-3, 3-1 MPSF) rebounded from last week’s loss to Stanford with an 11-6 win over Pacific on Saturday, just two days after a 19-7 beatdown of LMU.
Mighty Quin · Freshman goalie McQuin Baron continued his impressive debut season with seven saves against Loyola Marymount last Thursday. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Against Pacific, USC started out with three quick goals, and had a 3-0 lead in the second before the Tigers’ Devon Thumwood scored on a penalty shot. Nonetheless, Trojan senior driver Kostas Genidounias came right back and scored 30 seconds later. The Trojans scored three more unanswered goals and had a 6-1 lead until Pacific’s leading scorer Ben Stevenson scored two straight goals in less than a minute. Genidounias talked about his team’s response to a quick change from a 6-1 lead to a 6-3 lead.
“When you are up 5-1 and then 6-1, there is a tendency to relax a little, and that’s what happened,” Genidounias said. “They scored two quick goals, but then we came back with good defense, we scored our goals, and all went fine.”
It all went fine, indeed, because Genidounias and freshman utility Mihajlo Milicivec scored to give the Trojans an 8-3 lead going into the fourth. The two teams exchanged goals in the fourth but Pacific was unable to mount a comeback in the five-point Trojan win.
Last week, head coach Jovan Vavic was frustrated with the Trojans’ lackluster performance in the Stanford loss, but he was more content with Saturday’s performance.
“We played much better defense,” Vavic said. “We were more focused on defense, more alert, played better 5-on-6 defense, which was a big difference in the game against Stanford. That was a major problem. Our goalie had an excellent game. He had 18 saves, I think.”
That goalie is freshman McQuin Baron. After allowing a few goals in the second half, Baron was frustrated. Vavic liked Baron’s response, however, and characterizes it as one way the rookie plays beyond his years.
“That’s a sign of a good leader. He recognized that there are certain things we practiced, and we didn’t do the way we practiced,” Vavic said. “It was actually very similar to a situation that happened at Stanford, so he was voicing his opinion and letting the players know. I actually like that — that’s exactly what you want your goalie to do.”
Even when Baron did allow some goals, the Trojans were able to come back with some of their own. Time after time when the pressure is put on, either by a large deficit or by an opponent’s comeback, the Trojans have been able to turn on an extra gear. Vavic believes that this is an important feature of the team.
“Even though we are young, we have been pretty good at coming back. Even against Stanford, where things didn’t go our way, we still kept building and coming back,” Vavic said. “That’s a sign of a strong team. I think as the season goes on and we play more games we’re gonna be even better in that area. They are just learning to play with each other.”
One of the Trojans who is just learning to play on the team is freshman two-meter Lachlan Edwards, who had a big week with a total of six goals, three against LMU and three against Pacific. Edwards believes that the Stanford loss was a motivator for him.
“I think after a tough loss against Stanford everyone needed that kind of shock to switch on, and I think we are improving every game and I think I am as well,” Edwards said.
Vavic knew that Edwards always had these performances in him and has been trying to help him along in his development.
“He hasn’t always played to his potential, and I talk to him about that,” Vavic said. “I think he’s the most powerful center in the country. Sometimes his production is not on par with what his talent is. I think today he was more focused. He worked harder. He was really what I expected him to be.”
Another key player against Pacific was senior driver Rex Butler, who scored two goals and broke the century mark in goals for his career. The achievement, however, was just a bonus for him.
“Yeah, it’s cool,” Butler said. “I wouldn’t necessarily say it was one of my goals but it was a cool thing to have happen to me.”
It was a big win on Saturday with many impressive achievements, but, as always, Vavic’s Trojan squad is looking to improve. Butler explained what he believes his team should work on.
“Passing always needs to improve,” Butler said. “Today, I think we were a little impatient at times.”
Gendounias, another USC veteran, led the Trojans in scoring against Pacific with four goals and is now 11 shy of becoming the school’s all-time leading scorer.
Vavic believes that Saturday’s game was good preparation for their next game, Nov. 2 in Uytengsu Aquatics Center against UCLA.
“Pacific is a very crafty team,” Vavic said. “They run many plays on offense and are a good 6-on-5 team This was an important MPSF match for us, but we were really not thinking about UCLA until now.”

The USC football team was finally exposed Saturday night. A team that has been defined thus far by playing “not-to-lose” against quality opponents, lost. With only four games left in the season, it might be a wise time for the coaching staff to reexamine their offensive philosophy.
The fourth quarter followed what has become a predictable pattern. USC gets the ball. They have a couple of good offensive plays and drive into opponents’ territory. Then, for some inexplicable reason, they bleed the clock instead of running any semblance of their normal offense.
I assume the rationale behind this is to leave as little time as possible on the clock for the opponents. That would summarize the not-to-lose mentality that has marked this team. The problem with this is it gives the opponent the ability to dictate the outcome of the game.
Sometimes probability and luck will prevail like it did against Arizona and Stanford. Most good schools, however, will seize the opportunity, take the ball, march down the field and score. I know this is what good teams do because I grew up watching a USC dynasty that specialized in this in the rare close games they played.
The Utah game confirmed the 2014 Trojans’ identity: an incredibly talented team handicapped for the most part by risk-averse coaching.
This all could have been avoided after redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler’s brilliant third down throw to junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor on the final drive. Had the team gone for the jugular instead of bleeding the clock after that big play, the game would have been out of reach. Instead, the Trojans let Utah back in.
Clearly I’m not a college football coach. Maybe if I was, I could understand the logic behind insisting on sticking to a philosophy that has produced few results this season. It’s even more confusing to me that there is ample evidence showing this Trojan team can succeed throwing it 10 to 20 yards downfield in between the hashes, including the first touchdown drive on Saturday.
What reasoning is there to abandon something that is successful and go with something that clearly doesn’t work? Whatever it is, it’s the reason USC lost.
Right before the USC game started, I was watching Alabama play Tennessee. Tennessee had just scored to bring the game within 10 points late in the third quarter. They had momentum on their side, and Alabama appeared as if it might wilt.
Instead, the Crimson Tide took the football and marched it down the field en route to a clinching touchdown. They shut the door on the Volunteers. That’s the mark of a great team, and shutting the door  is what USC has failed to do this year. Saturday, the coaches squandered every opportunity to turn the game into a blowout.
One might try to attribute this loss to having only 48 scholarship players available. That is a perfectly reasonable explanation for why the Trojans defense was worn out in the fourth quarter. Knowing this, a great coach would plan a way to put the game far out of reach before the final drive. At that point, depth issues become irrelevant.
Even with little depth, lack of a killer instinct will prevent the Trojans from developing into a dominant dynasty again. Playing not to lose against good teams is the surest way to, in fact, lose. The passive approach to football just doesn’t work.
In football, you are what your record is. USC is not five big plays from being undefeated — they’re just an average seven-or eight-win football team.

Farzad, I have echoed the same sentiment you have towards our QB, he has below average arm and speed. It is a crying shame with all the talent and SPEED at WR we dont have a QB to stretch the field..It’s time to change it’s MAX BROWNE TIME  !!!!
When Sark came back to USC he indicated that he was here “to win championships”.  Well Sark, you cannot simply rely on the BRAND!  You are far from coaching greatness and your defensive coordinator is also at your level.
The worst thing that could have happened is that your ego insists that you should be calling the offense! This is terribly wrong! Your OC (in name only?) Coach Helton should be calling the plays from high atop the stadium where he has his pulse on  the field and the available space that you cannot seem to find from the sidelines. You call plays like you do not trust your fabulous roster of elite athletes, like you are afraid to lose, like you often don’t have a clue as to what your doing. You’ve been massively outcoached by coaches that have far inferior players to ours. You have not had this team ready to play each and every down. Some of the players in Utah’s last drive didn’t know what to do or what to expect. How could your DC not cover the receivers on the game losing play, when they knew that the Utes could not risk a running play?
How could your defense be so confused vs ASU where half of them thought the call was to cover the sideline pass and the other half thought to defend the Hail Mary, and you didn’t even have your big boys in the endzone .. tall guys like Banner, Dixon, Telfer, guys to get the ball knocked down. Why did half your D not know what the call was on the game saving play?
I could write for another hour on questions to Sark and Wilcox alone… These two are a far reach from elite NCAA coaches and our great athletes deserve far better. It was sickening watching us bleed to death up at Utah in a game that we should have won going far and away! Same went for watching Arizona almost come all the way back in the 4th quarter and same also for watching ASU come from the grave to devastate our players. Steve Sarkisian, the pulse of USC Football is too fast for you and you should be coaching somewhere in the small conferences. You’re simply not ready for USC.
How could your team arrive in Boston having no clue how to deal with a read/option QB? Why did you never spy the BC QB?
Coach Sarkisian is an example of a mediocre college football coach. He is Rid Rod, Mike Leach or even Jim Mora. Give the offense over to Helton and manage the damn game, the clock, the players expectations and morale on the sideline. Keeping you face in a play card is not what you are supposed to do. Yes, Sark, you have always been the play caller, but you’re doing a lousy job of it.
With this level of play calling, we are destined to lose to UCLA and Notre Dame, and could even lose to Wazzu and Cal. Sheesh! This season has been a disaster.  Yes the record is 5-3, but with Sark’s inability to coach his assistants and players accordingly, 
USC is not five big plays from being undefeated — they’re 3 plays from being 0-6.

A sloppy effort led to a disastrous finish for the USC Trojans, whose Pac-12 title hopes took a serious hit in a 24-21 road loss to the Utah Utes. Just eight seconds remained on the clock when Utah quarterback Travis Wilson found a wide open Kaelin Clay for a go ahead one-yard touchdown that gave the No. 19 Utes (6-1, 3-1 Pac-12) yet another signature win.
New Jack City · Freshman cornerback/wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson had a breakout performance against Utah on Saturday night, with a 105-yard kickoff return touchdown and a crucial forced fumble. Jackson would have had another touchdown if not for questionable officiating during the fumble. – Courtesy of the Daily Utah Chronicle
The No. 20 Trojans (5-3, 4-2) took a 21-17 lead with 10:18 remaining in the final quarter on a four-yard touchdown pass from redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler to sophomore wideout Darreus Rogers. USC reclaimed possession with seven minutes to play, but could not convert a fourth-and-short opportunity at the Utah 28-yard line with 2:08 remaining. That was all the time Wilson and the Utes needed for a game-winning drive.
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian managed to find a few positives in his team’s effort, but was ultimately disappointed.
“Utah played a hard-fought game,” Sarkisian said. “Our guys played hard but didn’t get it done.”
A wild opening quarter got off to a less-than-thrilling start for the Trojans. On just the second offensive play of the game, Utah defensive back Davion Orphey scooped up a backward lateral intended for Rogers and took it 53 yards for a touchdown. Orphey’s heads-up play came as most of the USC offense returned to the huddle, figuring the whistle had blown.
The Trojans would respond quickly, however, in the form of a 10-play, 75-yard drive that ended in a 10-yard strike to freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith. Kessler, who came out of the game for a short time after a hard hit, was a perfect 4-for-4 on the series.
The Utes took the lead once again midway through the second quarter, using good field position to set up a 24-yard field goal from All-American kicker Andy Phillips. Unfortunately for Utah, the advantage was short-lived. Freshman cornerback/wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson took the ensuing kickoff 105 yards for a score, giving the Trojans a 14-10 lead. The touchdown marked the second of Jackson’s career — but the youngster was not done yet.
Midway through the third quarter, Utah’s Clay returned a punt 51 yards to the USC 16-yard line. Just as it looked like the Utes would take their second lead of the night, however, Jackson stripped wide receiver Tim Patrick near the Trojans’ one-yard line. Because Patrick was incorrectly ruled down on the play, Jackson was denied a chance at his first career defensive touchdown and USC took the ball at its own 20.
The bad call came back to hurt the Trojans. Almost immediately, linebacker Jason Fanaika intercepted a poor throw from Kessler at the USC 41, leading to a 24-yard touchdown run from Utes’ running back Devontae Booker. To their credit, the Trojans bounced back with the 12-play, 73-yard drive that led to Rogers’ third touchdown of the season. But it would not be enough.
The USC offense was rendered completely ineffective for large portions of the contest, including a stretch that consisted of a fumble, five punts and an interception in a span of eight drives. Kessler, who finished the game 24-for-32 with 264 yards and two touchdowns, was the unit’s lone bright spot, while the Utah defense held redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen to just 3.7 yards per carry. Smith tied for a career high with six receptions.
Even through all the sloppiness and questionable play calling, USC still had a lead in the final minutes. Sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens, who spearheaded a gutsy defensive effort with two sacks, summed up the team’s feelings after the game.
“I’ve been saying it for a couple weeks now, we need to know how to finish,” Cravens said.
The Trojans will aim to pick themselves up off the mat for the third time this season next Saturday, this time against the Washington State Cougars in Pullman, Washington.
“We’ll get back up,” Sarkisian said. “We’ll get back on the horse for next Saturday.”

USC’s men’s and women’s swim teams hosted the Peter Daland Invitational this weekend at the Uytengsu Aquatic Center. The event was renamed to honor USC’s former nine-time NCAA championship coach who passed last Monday.
USC was the only collegiate team to race at the meet, competing against the Trojans and other local club teams.
“It was a good open to the season,” senior Cary Wright said. “It was good for us to get experience early in the season against some of the better high school and club teams in the area.”
The invitational kicked off Friday morning with USC junior Jasmine Tosky taking first the 100y fly in 54.63, followed by freshman Hannah Weiss (55.31) and junior Lucy Worrall (56.62). USC freshman Ralf Tribuntsov won the 100y fly for the men in 48.03 followed by sophomore Santo Condorelli (48.51) and junior Maclin Davis (48.86).
Senior Andrea Kropp won the 200y IM in 2:02.27 followed by Tosky (2:03.06) and sophomore Maggie D’Innocenzo (2:05.48).
Freshman Pawel Furtek led USC 500y free, finishing in 4:29.58, followed by sophomore Reed Malone (4:29.79).
Sophomore Michael Domagala won the 200y IM in 1:50.29 and senior Dakota Hodgson took third in 1:54.27.
Sophomore Evan Swenson won the women’s 50y free for USC in 23.58 and junior Kendyl Stewart took third in 23.92. Condorelli won it for the men with a time of 20.34.
The day ended with Malone, Domagala, Stewart and Swenson winning the mixed 400y free relay 3:15.37.
Senior Cary Wright and Domagala opened up the second day with a win for USC, taking first and second in the men’s 400y IM. They finished 4:00.47 and 4:01.46, respectively.
Tribuntsov won again for USC, taking the men’s 100y in 48.60 and senior Luca Spinazzola (50.21) and sophomore Jon Knox (51.10) finished third and fourth.
Kropp finished in third place in both the women’s 400y IM and the 100y breast, clocking 4:24.38 and 1:04.62, respectively.
USC swept the men’s events in the evening session of day two, while the women did not compete.
Tribuntsov swam his season-best 1:47.01 in the 200y back, followed by Wright (1:48.19) and Knox (1:50.17) and freshman Jason O’Brien in fourth with 1:53.96.
Condorelli won the 100y free in a season-best 44.19 followed by sophomore Dylan Carter (44.78).
USC took the top three spots in the men’s 200y fly. Wright added another victory for USC, clocking 1:48.53. Domagala (1:50.13)  and Hodgson (1:50.51) took second and third, respectively.
“We had a lot of people really step up,” Wright said. “It was pretty much a training meet for us. Our freshmen really stepped up and we were a good cohesive unit. Hopefully that’ll show in the dual meets this season.”
USC will host Arizona State in a dual meet at the Uytengsu Aquatic Center on Nov. 15 at 2 p.m.
“Against Arizona, we’re really trying to focus less on times and more on getting our hand to the wall first,” Wright said. “We want to touch people out and score the most points.”

Keene Pumpkin Festival, an annual event in New Hampshire ended in scenes of violent riot on Oct. 18 — the root of which remains murky. Posts on Twitter drew sobering attention to media comparisons between Ferguson and the more recent Pumpkin riot. Perhaps the most widely circulated quote from the festival is that of an 18-year-old rioter who traveled from out of state because, “It’s a blast to do things you’re not supposed to do.” With unimpressive quotes like this, and considering Keene State College’s track record for stirring up chaos and destruction in the absence of a compelling cause, it’s not hard to see why the Pumpkin Festival was initially an object of ridicule on social media. But according to several Twitter users, there are more than a few reasons why the fire-starting, bottle-throwing, street sign-throwing and Subaru-flipping that took place last weekend should be taken a bit more seriously.
At first glance, the conflict sounds almost like a joke. White, college-aged kids decide to riot at an annual pumpkin festival. An innocuous small-town event turned “rowdy” seems hardly anything worthy of serious consideration, especially in the absence of the kind of justifiable anger driven from by a notable cause. Well, for starters, just ask students at Keene State College who had to clean up after the riots. This was more than the aftermath of innocent horseplay among a few stray frat brothers. The riots were rumored to have begun at a crowded backyard party and spilled into the streets following frustration over police intervention. Evidently the damage inflicted sent at least 25 to the hospital and was enough for police to use tear gas to disperse the crowds that mainly consisted of college kids.
Yet, rubber bullets were also used, one aspect that suggests special treatment. It is precisely the combination of “vanilla” descriptions in the media and the actions of police that led the Twittersphere to — rightfully — erupt in a frenzy of ironic disdain. Many tweets referring to the event compared the treatment of these riots to events that transpired in Ferguson, Missouri, leaving teen Michael Brown dead by the hand of a police officer and sparking protests and unrest.
Tweets about the Pumpkin Festival riots are raising relevant questions about race. It’s abhorrent that one unarmed teen was shot six times in Missouri, while outright violence in New Hampshire was met calmly with measures such as pepper spray. One tweet highlighted this gross disparity, “‘White people riot for this —’ Puts a pumpkin on the stage. ‘Black people riot for *this* —’ Simulates being shot by a cop.”
Another tweet addressing the issue reads: “The kids at #keenestate threw beer cans at cops and got arrested. Mike Brown threw his hands up and caught SIX shots.”
Not all tweets were this serious. Many mocked initial reactions to Ferguson by applying them to the Pumpkin Festival riots. For example, one tweet read, “I am urging the parents of white youngsters particularly to not let their children go out wearing LL Bean. #Keene.”
But #PumpkinFest and all other witty sarcasm aside, the tweets point toward a larger issue: There is something tragically wrong with a criminal justice system that treats groups engaging in the same or similar activities differently when the only variable is race. If this isn’t an indicator of systemic racism, then skeptics must just be blind. And it doesn’t stop with police behavior, either.
The hashtags and tweets also do a clever job in drawing attention to how the uprising was handled by the media. This perception issue isn’t just limited to the police, it’s also culturally perpetuated by the press. One circulating meme compared word choice, pointing out that black protestors are labeled “thugs,” while their white counterparts are merely “rowdy.” The Pumpkin Festival rioters engaged in mischief, but the Ferguson riots were a display of “animal” behavior. Where Ferguson was an instance of “destroying the community,” the Pumpkin Festival was just a bunch of “booze-filled revelers” causing trouble.
Tweets addressing the problem are important because they come from real people speaking out. The beauty of a medium like Twitter is that it provides a forum for thought-provoking sound bites that come from the people. The large numbers involved in the discussion simply help catapult the issue onto a national stage.
The country owes Twitter a thank you for turning a riot people didn’t take seriously into a learning opportunity.

It was 1985 when the Kansas City Royals last went to the World Series. Nylon spandex, mullets and David Hasselhoff were all the rage. Cell phones were the size of my face. Now, almost three decades later, the Royals have entered the World Series arena once again. USA Today called their success remarkable. Their journey is being touted as a true Cinderella story that has most of the nation rallying behind them. This underdog title, focusing on the Royals Renaissance that popped up out of nowhere, however, is untrue and rather detrimental to the KC spirit.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
After 29 years of frustration and agony, Kansas City streets have erupted with cheers for the Royals. Happy tears and hugs between spectators close each game. October has been declared “Blue October,” in honor of the team color. And, according to a poll conducted by ESPN, Royals fandemonium has extended throughout the country as well, with 69 percent of the nation predicting a victory for the Royals in the World Series.
I have to confess now that I’m from Kansas City, so I am biased toward my hometown team. It’s a mentality bred in me because everyone there has blue-colored pride running through his or her veins. Kansas City hasn’t always been known for its sports culture (looking at you, Chiefs), yet before the recent winning streak, the fans were every bit the loyal Royals they are today. In witnessing the rest of America capitalize upon the success of my team, I’m getting quite territorial. Where were you guys when we “sucked”?
When pushed off to the side as a team that didn’t matter by most of the sports-watching American population, the Royals at least had a family of supporters who knew the team’s true worth. It was never the winning or losing that brought everyone together; it was the atmosphere of the game. Now, after garnering some attention for their wins, a lot of the hype has actually focused on the team’s past failures. Yes, in 2005 there were a total of 106 brutal losses, but do we really have to bring that up? The Royals are performing well right now, and that’s what matters.
More importantly, I question supporting an underdog just on the basis the team being an underdog. It’s heartwarming because it’s rooted in justice and sympathy, but another component of support for anyone coming into the limelight is that they are fresh and new. Consumer culture forces people to cycle blindly through trends — whether it’s Silly Bandz or Wiz Khalifa — before we actually understand their value. In the present, the fad can be refreshing, but it’s usually abandoned by the time “the next big thing” comes around. My fear is that the Royals will someday become a trend of the past akin to scrunchies. When that day comes, the underdogs will become overdogs. It’s a phenomenon perpetuated by our fascination with declaring our allegiances with the “loser.”
Just like television or movies, sports can be an escape for audiences. The Royals have allowed me to find that diversion from a busy life many times. I hope that this team is on the track to becoming a classic. Maybe a player will even get a candy bar named after him. As Lorde put it in her song, aptly named “Royals,” let me live that fantasy.

Musicians hoping to play in the big leagues typically get one shot. For Jessica Dobson, a Seattle-based multi-instrumentalist, getting not one but several invitations to work with the largest names in alternative rock was just a follow-up to her experience writing and recording her own music on a major label deal. From tours with Beck, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Spoon, Conor Oberst and The Shins, Dobson gained a reputation as one of the best guitarists and bassists in the business. But, apart from her involvement with festival-headlining acts, lies her main motivation for being a musician — her own band, Deep Sea Diver, which she writes and records music for with her husband and two other band members.
The group’s first record, History Speaks, was released in 2012, and an EP came out last month in anticipation of a new, full-length album to be released sometime next year. Speaking about the differences between material featured on the new release and what’s to come, Dobson said, “What differentiates the EP from the album is that [the EP is] kind of a little bit more of my singer-songwriter side and the album feels a lot more collaborative and full-band.”
The EP felt like a nice break between the two albums, which was exactly what Dobson, who’s evolving as an artist and transitioning between sounds, needed. “It gives you leeway to put a mish-mash of songs together without it sounding too disjointed, wheras with a full album some things just don’t work in terms of cohesiveness.”
One of the highlights of playing with so many other talented musicians on the road is the potential to learn from one another and gain new influences. Though Dobson is currently taking a break from working with other bands to focus on her own material, she still relishes the opportunity to work with others.
“I really like collaborating with people, and thankfully, that doesn’t mean that you have to dedicate two years of your life to be on the road with someone else’s project,” she said. “Recently, I’m planning on working with an awesome singer-songwriter up here called Bryan John Appleby, and I’m going to be working on his record. I just love collaborating and getting outside of my own mode of writing.”
Dobson has also been recording with Delicate Steve, a New Jersey guitarist who has some opening dates this fall for alt-psych favorite Tame Impala.
It is no overstatement to say that powerful, jangly guitar played by Dobson and the musicians she works with is heavily featured on Deep Sea Diver songs, with ebbing and flowing levels of intensity. Having spent her career playing in a wider variety of venues than most artists, this musical style mirrors her constantly changing landscape. That’s not to say she doesn’t have a preference for certain kinds of shows, however.
“Big shows are really fun because there is a lot of hype around them and it can be very thrilling, too,” Dobson said. “But after a while you get used to playing shows where peoples’ faces just become a sea of masses. Hands down, I’ll always prefer playing relatively smaller venues where you can hear people singing and interact more.”
Now that she and the rest of Deep Sea Diver have embarked on a tour with Delta Spirit, Dobson will have the chance to get up close with fans at venues like the El Rey Theatre here in Los Angeles on Thursday, after having played the Neptune Theatre in Seattle, the Wonder Ballroom in Portland and The Fillmore in San Francisco. Dobson put together these dates with Delta Spirit out of a long unfulfilled dream to tour together; she grew up playing with the members of Delta Spirit, and has never been able to coordinate with them to do a string of shows. For those craving a concert full of driving, melodic indie rock, stopping by one of these performances would hit the spot.

Since she was 14 years old and knocking on doors in Nashville, Taylor Swift has always been one to go big. The multi-platinum singer’s latest album, 1989 is no exception.
1989 is a roller coaster of sounds — ups, downs, synths and drums, none of which have ever been heard before from Swift. These elements interact and culminate to create a pop album that is musically brilliant and serves as a perfect milestone in her career, lending sophisticated musical credibility and a launchpad for her new pop prospects.  At the age of 24, Swift’s music has finally lost the diary-like naïveté and angst it always possessed and moved on to bigger and better things.  This album, bursting at the seams with optimism, offers a realistic, maturing twist on many of the same issues Swift has always written about.

Swift’s songwriting has always yanked emotion out of even the hardest-hearted of listeners, but its girlish drama was a turnoff for many.  1989, though, manifests the same emotional pull but with a more sophisticated, levelheaded and, maybe more importantly, assured approach.
In typical Swift fashion, the songs on 1989 center almost entirely on her romantic relationships.  This time, though, she approaches them with the pragmatic realism of a 24-year-old woman, instead of the jaded naïveté of an 18-year-old girl.  Swift’s fresh take on relationships comes to light and emphasizes her maturity.  “All You Had To Do Was Stay”, for example, continues the trend of relationship songs, but are presented in a very different light than anything she has ever written. The title gives the impression that this song will once again sully one of Swift’s many exes for not staying, but she instead admits her own part in a bungled relationship.  This approach makes obvious the fact that Swift has done a lot of maturing in both her personal life and her songwriting.
“Style” brings to a positive light a failed relationship — something that is rare in Swift’s songwriting.  It is reminiscent but grounded and, though it has the potential to be another Swift kick in the you-know-whats to a certain British pop sensation ex-boyfriend, doesn’t paint him in a negative light.  The newly-sobered Swift instead opts for a change of pace, taking responsibility and acknowledging the fact that relationships are a two-way-street.  In fact, none of the songs on 1989 do.  Swift’s ex-shaming days appear to have finally come to a close, which is a refreshing change and makes the entire album immediately more likeable.
Even “Bad Blood”, a song about catty competition reminiscent of “Better Than Revenge” that tells the story of a frenemy who did Swift wrong, has a more mature take.  Swift makes it clear that she is not one to mess with without sounding like a guileless, whiny girl-done-wrong.
1989 opens with the highly criticized “Welcome To New York”, one of the most upbeat tracks on the album.  This song, with its confident testament to new beginnings, serves as an analogy for the entire album—it signifies Swift’s break from country and her transition to a world of mainstream popular music that she has managed to make all her own.
She then moves into two tracks that solidify her transition to pop.  “Blank Space” and “Style” are chalk full of synth and electronic sounds and couldn’t be considered country even in the cursory sense that Swift once incorporated into Red.  “Blank Space” shows a mature approach to Swift’s notorious dating.  “Got a long list of ex lovers/They’ll tell you I’m insane,” she crows, knowingly.  “But I’ve got a blank space/*pen click*/And I’ll write your name.”  Funny and astute, the song is the first sign that Swift has ever acknowledged her own part in her infamous relationship issues.
“I Know Places” goes into a place darker than any Swift has ever delved, with a surprisingly deep, enigmatic intro that proves she is still fearless.  The chorus, though, plunges once again into the upbeat character that underlies all of 1989.  The positive spin on this album that is prevalent in some way in every track is one we’ve been waiting for from Swift.  An obviously genuine optimism toward life, love and critics shines through her work and is guaranteed to help any listener “Shake It Off”.
Swift also brings in breathy pieces that she’s never explored before.  “Wildest Dreams” and, especially, “Clean” prove that Swift can not only successfully make a pop album, but that she can go almost anywhere she wants to with her music.  “Clean” is Swift’s token ballad but is also unlike any ballad she has ever produced.  It encompasses the deeply emotional undertones of songs like “All Too Well”, but in an entirely different style.  Light and breathy, her collaboration on this track with Imogen Heap is evident and so successful.  Swift transforms a beautiful ballad, one strength she has had since her very first album, into something brand new and different that slides perfectly into the last spot on 1989.  It is the perfect ending to an incredibly daring album.
Swift’s endeavor into uncharted territory was a huge leap and it paid off.   Her realism and maturity are refreshing and don’t drag down any of the 13 upbeat, strikingly catchy songs.  This notable synthesis of fun and verism sets up an album brimming with catchy musical acumen and, more than ever before, undeniable credibility.  1989 sounds nothing like any music Swift has ever produced — it deviates from her most poppy songs (think: “I Knew You Were Trouble” and “Red”) — while also maintaining her heightened emotion and the confessional quality that have already endeared her to so many fans.  Her newfound maturity and optimism practically radiate off of every striking track to generate a truly impressive and unique album that brings her out of the woods and onto the pop scene in a transition as drastic as it is superb.
