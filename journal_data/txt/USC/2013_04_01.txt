The Marshall School of Business announced Thursday that it will offer a new master of science degree in global supply chain management this fall.
The classes for the program will be available both online and in person. Online coursework will be transmitted by studio classrooms, and lectures are available online throughout the semester. Students are also able to communicate with each other via an online platform.
According to Ravi Kumar, a professor of information operation management and who is the faculty director of the program, the degree is meant for working professionals in the United States, China, India and South Korea, since these countries are active in the global market.
“These Asian countries are big producers,” Kumar said. “But we are focusing on these places to start with. There are plans to expand.”
In addition to online coursework, international students will be able to meet with a faculty partner of the program at local universities to discuss their progress in the program and the material presented online.
Kumar said the program is designed for midcareer individuals who are looking to improve the efficiency of the companies they work for and move to a higher-level position in the company.
Students will also be required to attend two class trips, one to Singapore and another in Los Angeles, to see the global trade firsthand. Kumar said that these trips will give students the opportunity to collaborate.
“Students will get to see each other for the first time,” Kumar said. “Eventually, they will be working on projects from different countries.”
Kumar said this degree is important as global business becomes more prevalent in today’s trade-based economy.
“Countries are always shipping to other countries, but the question is, ‘How do we make this happen in a seamless, efficient way?” Kumar said. “We’re trying to educate people to become knowledgeable and help their companies make stronger decisions to make them more efficient from a global perspective.”

Perhaps it’s fitting that Undergraduate Student Government President Mikey Geragos and Vice President Vinnie Prasad went to Disneyland on Friday as one of the last events of their term, which ends today. They are, after all, not just co-leaders but close friends.
When reflecting on the past year, Geragos said he still remembers when he first thought about asking Prasad to run with him.
“I texted Vinnie the exact text someone going on an awkward blind date would text,” Geragos said with a laugh. “It was like, ‘Hey, want to meet for coffee?’”
Of course, Prasad said he had figured out Geragos’s intentions. Though Geragos had heard rumors about Prasad running for president himself, Prasad said he knew immediately what his answer would be.
“There were people who were really pushing me to run for president, but it just didn’t feel right for me,” Prasad said. “When Mikey approached me, that felt right.”
The day after the two made the decision, they were up and running their campaign and working on their plans.
Both Geragos and Prasad were members of USG all four years of their college careers and see it as the defining factor of their college experience.
Both praise the other for unique attributes that carry over into the duties of their jobs. Geragos spoke at length about Prasad’s holistic perspective when analyzing issues that affect the USG’s operations, while Prasad said Geragos is excellent at developing strong relationships with administrators.
“I love how we work together,” Geragos said.
Geragos said one major accomplishment is their work on the “Village at USC” plan. He believes the plan’s progress shows the work students can accomplish when they truly care about issues on campus. Prasad agreed that working with city officials was a rewarding experience.
“It was fun going down to City Hall and getting to speak on behalf of the students and their views,” Prasad said.
Moreover, Geragos and Prasad made it their goal to increase USG’s social media and Internet presence. They launched a new website that hosts all the information about on-campus initiatives and established a weekly newsletter, along with increasing USG’s likes on Facebook and followers on Twitter.
Nick Kosturos, the director of leadership funding for USG, said Geragos and Prasad’s leadership allowed USG to give more funding to student organizations than ever before. More than $250,000 were distributed to various student organizations from funding board allocations.
“The funding we were able to give out and better distribute because of their leadership went to student organizations for philanthropy, leadership, professional, academic and discretionary purposes,” Kosturos said.
Geragos and Prasad also restructured the organization to better detail each department’s duties. Kosturos said they changed the definitions of each committee and created a more even workload.
“[Geragos and Prasad] led a huge restructuring effort to make USG more efficient and better able to serve the student body — this much-needed reorganization will be going into effect next year,” Kosturos said.
In the past year, USG has streamlined the structure of its advocacy groups. In addition, Geragos and Prasad advocated for the building of The Village at USC,  a renovation project which was approved by the city in December. Geragos and Prasad said while they will not necessarily experience the benefits of the Village they understand that planning for the future is an important part of their job.
“There are moments when you’re focusing so much time on stuff that is not going to effect you,” Geragos said.
They both look forward to coming back and seeing how their work has grown. Prasad said they are so used to “putting out fires every week” that it would be fun to come back in the office with less stress.
“The hardest part of the student government is that you have only a year in charge of organization,” Geragos said.  “No one cares as much as you do about the organization or the success that you have, so at times it can be frustrating doing the work you feel has sometimes gone unnoticed.”
Overall, Geragos would describe the whole, sometimes hectic, term as a “learning experience.”
“We were constantly learning and constantly becoming more self-aware and more understanding of who we are truly as people, and more specifically as leaders,” Geragos said.
Prasad also said he learned more about decision-making, taking others’ ideas into account and communication.
“Even if something is a brilliant idea in my head, it doesn’t mean that it is a brilliant idea for other people,” Prasad said.
After graduation, Geragos is planning on applying to law school, while Prasad is going to work as an economic consultant and thinks that he will eventually go back to school to get a master’s in business administration.
But, until then, the two can take a sigh of relief and many more joint Disneyland trips as their yearlong term of wearing suits and improving the organization draws to a close.

Undergraduate Student Government has been making attempts to implement a university-wide fall break for many years and, despite overwhelming student support, it is still unclear when a fall break might be implemented.
Last semester, USG Senate sent a proposal to the administration. The proposal for fall break would involve the removal of two academic days in the middle of the semester and the addition of two days to the beginning of the school year in August.
USG officials focused on researching student interest for fall break last semester, and their proposal is currently under review by the university’s Academic Scheduling Committee.
During the fall 2012 semester, Geragos and his council researched schools with fall breaks looking for more information on schools with similar schedules.
Nineteen of the top 25 universities operate on a semester system. Ten of those universities have a two-day or more break in the fall semester. Fifteen of the top 25 universities have a one-day or longer break in their fall semester.
Of the top universities in the nation according to the U.S. News and World Report, Princeton, Duke, and Notre Dame all have one-week breaks in the middle of the fall semester.
Geragos’ cabinet then took into consideration students, surveying 918 students to gain better insight from the student population. Ninety percent of those surveyed, or 825 students, said the university should add a fall break to the academic calendar. Ten percent of those surveyed, or 89 students, said it was not necessary to implement a fall break.
Many students also said they were in support of a fall break, even if it altered the academic calendar. When asked to choose their top reason for fall break, 85 percent of students surveyed said the break provides an opportunity to de-stress from the semester. Improved academic performance and travel opportunities followed, with 64 percent and 61 percent, respectively.
The survey showed that students were willing to accept additional academic days in order to receive a short break in the fall. Geragos noted that the focus of a fall break would be different from other breaks.
“This shouldn’t be viewed as a spring break in the fall,” Geragos said. “It is a way for students to compose themselves and take a few days off without schoolwork.”
Surveyed students were also more willing to start the academic year earlier than they were to end it later: Fifty percent said they were willing to start earlier, while 40 percent said they would want the fall semester to end later.
The Academic Scheduling Committee is currently reviewing a proposal from USG Senate. The proposal consists of starting the eighth week of the fall semester on a Wednesday, giving students Monday and Tuesday.
Geragos said the proposal is advantageous for both the student body and the administration.
“I believe this will be a fair compromise between what the students want and the concerns for instructional days,” Geragos said.
Geragos said throughout the process, faculty and school officials have consistently understood the student benefits of a break in the fall, recognizing the need for students to re-evaluate during the given time.
Some students, such as Rachel Kohn, a freshman majoring in broadcast journalism, said fall break would have academic benefits.
“It is a time for students to take a break from the schedule and get back into the swing of things,” Kohn said. “It is a regular thing on the East Coast, and I was surprised when I got out here and there was not one.”
And Abi Oseni, a freshman majoring in business administration, said a fall break would simply give students an opportunity to relax during the long fall semester.
“A fall break is a great idea,” Oseni said. “It would provide students with a much needed break during the semester. A lot of my friends at other schools have a break during the fall semester, and USC should do the same.”
Some students, however, said pre-existing breaks are enough.
“Honestly, two days is not that big of a difference for me. I would just do the full week at Thanksgiving,” said Mitchell Diesko, a sophomore majoring in political science and international relations and global business. “I am not going to argue with two days.”
Others, including Elizabeth Henry, a junior majoring in philosophy and minoring in linguistics, said squabbling over the exact number of days for a fall break is unnecessary.
“I would take any break over no break. A break is a break,” Henry said. “In the spring semester, we get those days off and I can work with that.”
Geragos said though the implementation of a fall break has yet to be approved or determined, more information on committee decisions will come in the following weeks. Any final proposal will have to be approved by Provost Elizabeth Garrett.
2013-14 Undergraduate Student Government presidential tickets campaigned on the platform of adding a four-day weekend in the fall semester…
I THINK? it’s already called Thanksgiving…

After weeks of speculation, USC announced Monday evening the hiring of new men’s basketball coach Andy Enfield, formerly of Florida Gulf Coast University.

Enfield recently shocked the college basketball world by leading FGCU to the NCAA tournament’s Sweet 16, the furthest a No. 15 seed had ever advanced in the tournament.
Enfield’s prior head coaching experience is brief, yet he and his team left an indelible impact on this year’s tournament. In just his second year at the helm of FGCU, the Eagles became the talk of March Madness as an exciting underdog that earned the moniker “Dunk City” thanks to its thunderous slam dunks in upsets over Georgetown and San Diego State.
Enfield, 43, previously worked as a shooting coach in the NBA and was later an assistant coach for five years at Florida State. After FGCU’s elimination at the hands of Florida, Enfield become a hot commodity among schools with head coaching vacancies, with his name mentioned for nearly every available major opening.
In his two seasons at FGCU, Enfield’s teams posted a 41-28 record.
USC is coming off of a 14-18 season in which it fired former head coach Kevin O’Neill in January. Under interim head coach Bob Cantu, the team went 7-8 and was knocked out of the first round of the Pac-12 tournament.
The Trojans are expected to play an up-tempo style under Enfield, a stark contrast to the grind-it-out, deliberate game plan favored by O’Neill.

Junior swimmer Vladimir Morozov and sophomore discus thrower Alexandra Collatz were named USC Student Athletes of the Week on Monday after each shined in their respective competitions.
Morozov led the charge for the USC swim and dive team at the NCAA championship meet in Indianapolis last weekend.  The 2012 London Olympic bronze medalist broke the NCAA record in the 100-yard freestyle with a time of 40.76. The historic performance earned USC its first NCAA title in the event since 1974.
But this was just one of Morozov’s many conquests. He also helped give the Trojans’ first 400-yard freestyle relay championship since 1977 when he teamed up with sophomore Cristian Quintero and juniors Dimitri Colupaev and Jack Wagner to post a school record time of 2:48.33.
Morozov led a USC team that broke 16 school records during the meet, including on all five relays. USC finished fourth overall in the meet, the school’s highest finish in 12 year’s and best since USC head coach Dave Salo took over in 2006.
In contrast to Morozov’s sensational finish to his season, Collatz’s track and field season is only just beginning, though the sophomore is off to a strong start. Last weekend, she won the discus title at the Cal-Nevada Championships in La Jolla, Calif., with a mark of 178-6, second furthest in the country by a college female this year.  The throw was also Collatz’s personal best.
The Bakersfield, Calif., native has already won the discus title in the Trojan Invitational and the Beach Classic during the month of March.  This early-season success comes on the heels of an impressive freshman campaign, in which Collatz set the school freshman discus throw record in her first collegiate track meet, only to best that mark later in the season with a 177-11 mark. That mark put her in second place on USC’s all-time list, trailing only Kate Hutchinson’s school record of 189-5 in 2006.

Someone is the hero and someone is the goat in spring practice. Someone enjoys success at another’s expense.
And through three weeks of spring ball for USC, that message largely rings true. At present, the Trojans’ collection of receivers is playing the role of hero.
The receiving corps shined during Saturday’s 52-play scrimmage at the Los Angekes Memorial Coliseum, even with junior wide receiver Marqise Lee sidelined because of a knee injury. Sophomore wideout Nelson Agholor scored on a touchdown pass of about 75 yards from quarterback Cody Kessler. Junior George Farmer hauled in a 47-yard reception. Redshirt sophomore Victor Blackwell caught a 25-yard touchdown pass.
If you happened to stop by the stadium on that particular afternoon, you would have seen a fair share of big plays. Yup, those receivers looked fast. This is reassuring considering that, at present, it is unknown who will be throwing the passes come fall.
But the concerning part is this: They were blowing past USC’s secondary. That’s the flipside of the coin. As strong as Agholor, Farmer and the rest have looked in recent weeks, they have also enjoyed their successes at the expense of an inexperienced and still-developing secondary.
Here’s what’s been clear: The back four of the defense, particularly the cornerback positions, is the unit in question and is one that remains increasingly problematic.
“We have a lot of concerns at corner right now, and it showed up today,” USC head coach Lane Kiffin said Saturday. “Three go routes in man coverage.”
Those three “go routes” went for touchdowns.
Evidently, finding the right match at cornerback has been anything but easy. To start off the spring, USC lined up freshmen defensive backs Su’a Cravens and Leon McQuay III at cornerback. But since the first week, they’ve found homes elsewhere — Cravens at “nickel corner” and McQuay at safety. It doesn’t appear likely either will move at this point.
Florida transfer Josh Shaw, who spent his first season in the program primarily at cornerback, has moved back to safety. Sophomore cornerback Kevon Seymour and redshirt freshman cornerback Devian Shelton are currently out with injuries.
And of course it doesn’t help that Nickell Robey opted to declare for the NFL draft, forgoing his senior season.
“The early departure of Nickell really hurt us for a guy who is not going to be a first-round draft pick,” Kiffin added. “That was the kind of experience we were hoping would come back.”
But that experience is gone, and the bulk of the experience that the Trojans have left comes from senior cornerback Torin Harris and redshirt junior cornerback Anthony Brown, who have assumed the role as the team’s top two cornerbacks. Thus far, though, both have struggled, including during Saturday’s scrimmage.
“He’s really inconsistent,” said new defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast when asked about Harris last week. “And we’re looking for consistent players we can depend on.”
This isn’t nitpicking a position group in the spring but rather a growing concern for a defense that, in Pendergast’s system, hopes to be more aggressive. In particular, it’s a defense that requires corners to play more single coverage. They’re struggling with that now, and playing single coverage appears increasingly risky.
“We have to get better with the guys we have,” Kiffin said. “We have to play better, have to coach better.”
The reason USC has to get better with the guys it has is because, well, Kiffin and Co. don’t exactly have any other choice.
Freshman cornerback Chris Hawkins is the only member of USC’s 13-player 2013 signing class who naturally plays the position. As tiresome as it has become to hear the oft-heard line about limited scholarships and depth over the last year, that issue only gets worse as the years progress: Next fall will be the beginning of year two of the three-year 75-player scholarship cap.
For now, USC must do its best with what it has. There won’t be any reinforcements coming between now and the start of fall camp.
There aren’t exactly plenty of backup plans, either. USC needs Harris to be more consistent. The same goes for Brown. Hawkins, though barely out of high school, needs to grow up quickly.
Such is the circumstance.
A revamped defense, though, is expected to be at the heart of the turnaround USC hopes will come in 2013. And that revamped defense is largely predicated on being aggressive, playing — as Pendergast has reiterated on several occasions — on the offense’s side of the line of scrimmage.
But, to do all of that, USC can’t afford to be beaten deep on “go routes,” not this frequently.
That’s how you lose football games, something the Trojans have done far too much of lately.

Though the major leaguers are starting their season this week, the USC baseball team reaches the halfway point of its season tonight when it hosts UC Irvine at Dedeaux Field.
Smooth sailing · Junior infielder Kevin Swick has turned in a solid first half of the season, batting .304 with a team-leading six doubles. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The matchup marks the Trojans’ (11-16) first game at home since March 17, having spent most of spring break on the road and the past weekend at Cal.
USC emerged from Berkeley with their first conference series win of the year and its first conference series road victory since 2011. The Trojans will play at home for seven of their next eight games and don’t leave Los Angeles again for three weeks, a welcome respite for a road-weary team.
“It’s great to be back here at home,” said freshman shortstop Blake Lacey after Monday’s practice, just the team’s second at Dedeaux Field since spring break began. “You could tell the guys were just a little more excited, — practice was a little more lively.”
The game against the Anteaters (16-8) will be no respite for the Trojans, however. UC Irvine is a team that consistently punishes opposing pitchers. Six starters are slugging above .400, and the onslaught is led by sophomore Connor Spencer’s .416 batting average, .481 on base percentage and .551 slugging percentage.
That’s not exactly what the Trojans need to be going up against, especially considering the season-long struggles of their bullpen.
But with the always-challenging Stanford Cardinal looming next weekend, USC head coach Dan Hubbs said he needs to use tonight’s game to get a few of his relievers back on track. That starts with sophomore Nigel Nootbaar, who will start on the mound against the Anteaters.
“Nootbaar’s really been scuffling,” Hubbs said. “He was our best reliever at the start of the year, and we need him pitch like that again.”
Nootbaar had a 2.30 ERA heading into spring break, having allowed just four earned runs over 15 2/3 innings. Since then, he’s allowed nine runs in two 2/3 innings, ballooning his ERA to 6.50.
Hubbs said that, though he would love to see Nootbaar dominate as he did in his only other start of the year at Fresno State, when he struck out 12 over six innings. But if he doesn’t, there is a good chance Hubbs will use tomorrow as an all-staff day.
“It may end up being scripted,” Hubbs said. “So after Nootbaar’s done, we have a few guys lined up who will each go one inning and then get out. That way they all get a chance, and no one tires themselves out for the weekend.”
The bullpen has been wildly inconsistent all year for the Trojans, with a pitcher dominating one day then surrendering four runs in his next outing.
“Our issues are our issues,” Hubbs said. “One of those is a young pitching staff. That can only change so much.”
USC’s other big issue has been timely hitting. The Trojans have about as many total hits as their opponents, but have close to 50 fewer runs scored. USC has stranded enough runners at third and hit into enough rally-killing double plays to make a coach pull his hair out, as Hubbs has no doubt done at times.
But the Trojans looked a lot better at the plate over the weekend in Berkeley, and it appears as if Hubbs has finally found a lineup he plans to stick with after spending most of the season tinkering with the roster. The team hopes to keep that momentum and discipline going into tonight and moving forward this weekend.
“It’s nice to have a secure lineup that you can go to,” Lacey said. “Adjustments are needed every once in a while, but it’s good to have the same guys around you who you can trust to get the job done.”
First pitch is scheduled for 6 p.m., and the first 100 students in attendance will receive free tacos in accordance with “Taco Tuesday.” The game can be followed live on USC’s official athletic site.
What is the word on Dante Flores with his injury status? Need his bat in the lineup definitely.

The scratched, they clawed, they fought their way back, but in the end, the Women of Troy were unable to overcome the 10-3 deficit they faced at halftime and dropped a home game 16-11 to Denver on Sunday at McAlister Field.
Off the mark · Freshman attack Caroline de Lyra (left) scored just one goal in USC’s 16-11 defeat Sunday at the hands of Denver at McAlister Field. De Lyra is the team’s leading scorer with 41 goals and 82 total points. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
After losing two straight road games, one against Bryant and one against Brown, the USC women’s lacrosse team had nine days off before Sunday’s game against the Pioneers.  The extra rest appeared to leave a bit of rust, however, as the team came out and immediately fell behind.
Freshman attack Caroline Cordrey led the Women of Troy (5-8, 2-2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) with four goals on six shots as USC closed out the month of March with a three-game losing streak and a 3-6 record in nine games. Freshman midfield Amanda Johansen added three goals, two assists and eight draw controls.
Meanwhile, attacker Rachael Dillon led the Pioneers (11-1, 3-0 MPSF) with 4 goals and an assist.
Despite the team’s excitement for the return home from its Rhode Island trip, the weather seemed more like Rhode Island than it did Southern California. Perhaps distracted by the elements, USC allowed Denver to jump out to a 3-0 lead a little more than eight minutes into the game, and stretched it out to a 10-3 lead at the half behind 3 goals from Dillon. Cordrey, sophomore midfield Kaila Sommi and freshman attack Caroline de Lyra all scored for USC, which was outshot 18-11 by the Pioneers at the half.
“Their goalie [Hannah Hook] is really awesome,” freshman midfielder Amanda Johansen said. “Her save percentage is super high, and she’s one of the best goalies in the nation. We had the opportunity, but we need to take that extra step and just shoot a little more around her. We learned that in the first half, and we came out in the second half and we were doing just that. Denver’s offense really capitalized on all their plays.”
Denver goalie Hook earned five saves on USC’s 16 shots on goal, while USC freshman goalie Liz Shaeffer saved eight of Denver’s 24 shots on goal.
Denver looked as if it was going to extend its lead against the Women of Troy after scoring the first goal of the second half to take an 11-3 lead. But USC was able to respond, scoring four unanswered goals (two from Cordrey) to cut the lead to 11-7, fighting through a slight drizzle that started around seven minutes into the second half and subsided before the game ended.
Denver buckled down after that, however, outscoring USC the rest of the way. Overall, USC outscored the Pioneers 8-6 in the second half, with both teams taking 11 shots.
Though the result was disappointing, players were pleased with the way they responded after falling behind early in the game.
“After playing for half an hour, you notice little things that give you opportunities, like you can notice where the defense likes to go, where the open places are,” Johansen said. “We just used that to our advantage. We fed to the spots that were open and we took it when they sent the double.”
USC head coach Lindsey Munday offered was concerned about the team’s slow start, which has become something of an unwelcome trend as the team inches closer to the postseason.
“You have to learn from every game, win or loss,” Munday said. “Certainly in this one, it’s pretty obvious we have to come out in the first half and play and compete better than we did. For us, it’s happened before, so we really need to figure out what we need to do in order to come out from the opening whistle and play hard.”
During its current three-game drought, USC has been outscored 40-27, only managing to score in double digits once. On the season, the team has scored more than 10 goals in a game eight times, winning five of them.
The Women of Troy continue their slate of conference games on the road, taking on Oregon (5-5, 0-1 MPSF) on Thursday, April 4 at 4:30 p.m. They return back to McAlister Field for a pair of games against California (5-4, 3-0 MPSF) on Friday, April 12, at 3 p.m. and Fresno State (2-6, 0-2 MPSF) on Thursday, April 20, at 3 p.m.

Sometime during the past week, between recovering from a crazy spring break and catching up on work pushed aside, I looked out my window and saw it.
Spring.
Though we live in the land of no seasons, the past few months have been filled with rainy days and frigid nights. And though my friends back on the East Coast told me to “Shut the f-ck up”considering they walked to class feet deep in snow, I couldn’t help but long for a day when the sun would come out and stay out. A day in which I could wear something other than jeans and boots. A day in which a sweatshirt and a jacket weren’t required to get through the day.
And now it’s here. Ah, spring! Oh, how I’ve missed you. Layering has gone out the window and I plan on finally getting the chance to wear brightly colored skirts and dresses that have gone ignored in my closet for the past few months. Gladiator sandals will be pulled out from under the bed and sunglasses will now have a prime spot on my desk.
Many often brag about Southern California’s beautiful and sunny weather. But despite our many warm winter days, that does not excuse wearing clothes intended for a different season.
Trust me, there’s nothing worse than a person rocking an out-of-season outfit. No matter how warm it was, it was still winter and certain colors, fabrics and patterns were completely off limits.
So what’s OK and what’s off limits to wear now that spring is in session? Don’t get stuck in a winter rut — it’s time to break down what you need for a spring renewal.
Wear your hat well
As much teasing as I get for wearing it, there’s nothing like a good ol’ beanie to cover a bad hair day and keep you toasty. Unfortunately, however, the days of rocking your beanie are over. It’s spring now, people. It’s too warm to pretend like you’re alternative enough to rock a beanie to that Menlo party. Forgoing a beanie will also probably protect you from the kind of vicious jokes that often get thrown my way when I wear my ’SC fleece one.
What to do instead? Try finding a small-brimmed fedora or even an assortment of headbands or headscarves to wear on a bad hair day. A fedora will protect your face from the sun (take that, UV rays!), and scarves are definitely making a comeback. A colorful head accessory will certainly brighten up any outfit as well as disguise your hair that looks like it recently underwent an attack.
It’s all in the pattern
You were so excited when you picked up those floral jeans on sale at the end of the summer. But then you realized that you probably couldn’t get a good wear out of them until spring.
Have no fear, the season is here.
Florals and polka dots are definitely hot right now so make sure you have at least one pair of patterned jeans to funk up any classic T-shirt. Slim ankle cuts are in for girls while a simple boot-cut patterned pant is more than sufficient for the men out there.
In terms of color, think bright. Electric blues, radiant pinks and vivid yellows are all great options. And remember: If it’ll make you look like a depressed NYU student (basically all NYU students), don’t wear or buy it. Spring is a time for colors, light fabrics and patterns that say “Hello world!” Leave the black and gray business at home — that’s what winter is for.
Get the clunkers out
Yes, combat boots are adorable and comfortable yet cool at the same time, but it’s time to start transitioning out your winter shoes for something that doesn’t say “Berlin Wall.” Snatch up a pair of gladiator sandals or Havaianas. Boys can easily invest in a pair of light-colored Chuck Taylors. (Nothing’s more attractive than a guy in well-fitting jeans and Converse.)
So no more Uggs, no more boots and no more awkward loafers. Think clean, think fresh, think less clunky. If it’s something you’d wear to keep the snow off of your feet, then it’s not a good option for spring.
A lot of pieces can be used to transition between seasons. For example, a white T-shirt has no limits any time of the year. But it’s important to remember that fashion is constantly evolving, constantly looking toward the future — after all, why do you think there are new collections every few months?
Growing up, my mother used to tell me that my velvet dress was out of season when I tried to rock it during the summer. At the time, I ignored her, but after a few years I finally understood.
Every item of clothing, after all, has its place in the season, in your closet and in your heart.

Wow, how to dress in Springtime. I never knew.
Thank you Ms. Watson.

It’s been hard to miss the buzz that preceded the premiere of season three of HBO’s Game of Thrones. HBO has practically plastered the town with cryptic advertisements first featuring just the date 03.31.13, followed by images of the dirty faces of various characters looking squarely at the camera.
Dragon fire · Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), known as the Queen of Dragons because she has three as pets, is rumored to play a large role in this season of Game of Thrones, as she seeks to take the Iron Throne. — Courtesy of HBO
With all the hype, did the season premiere, “Valar Dohaeris,” live up to the standard set by the previous season? Yes it did — and it’s those dirty faces, or rather the actors and the writers behind them, who delivered.
Despite the fact that Game of Thrones falls under the literary category of epic fantasy, it is first and foremost a story following the lives of extremely complex and dynamic characters as they fight for power and survival in the mythical land of Westeros.
Game of Thrones features intricate and fascinating plot twists, but “Valar Dohaeris” devotes its time to the characters. This episode ties up the cliff hangers left at the end of season two, such as Tyrion Lannister’s role at court, Daenarys Targaryen’s path towards Westeros and the state of her dragons. It also re-establishes relationships that had been neglected in the plot-heavy season two, though some characters’ story arcs were  merely delayed until later episodes.
Though this particular episode is fairly light on plot development, it more than makes up for it using character development, with excellent performances from all the actors. Peter Dinklage and Charles Dance steal the episode as the stormy relationship between Tyrion and his father Tywin is laid bare for the audience.
Other actors make the hour-long show engaging as well. Carice van Houten gives yet another chilling performance as the red priestess Melisandre, setting the stage for a series of scenes featuring her character that is enchanting and enraging. Natalie Dormer as Margaery Tyrell, an important but relatively unaddressed character introduced last season, exudes warmth while delivering well-scripted lines. Her scene with Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister sets up a  tense dynamic that everyone will want to watch in the coming episodes.
The episode adds two newcomers to its already large cast. Both Mance Rayder (Ciarán Hinds) and Tormund Giantsbane (Kristofer Hivju) perform admirably. Their scene with Kit Harington is one of the best blocked and performed scenes in the episode, and their short performances introduce their characters.
The balancing of these plots and characters reveals the true talent of the show’s writers. The episode does not feel rushed or too full, despite the regular shifts in setting and character.
Still, the minutes don’t always fly by with purpose. A scene that explains the qualities of a race of slave warriors — details that are potentially important — drags on. Additionally, a great deal of time is spent on a relatively minor character, named Bronn, for no apparent purpose.
Visually, the episode is stunning, as one might expect from a television show that’s shot on location in Iceland, Ireland and Croatia. The opening of the episode is particularly dramatic, with the noise of a battle blazing while the screen remains black. It then fades to a blizzard swirling across the snowy North as the sounds of the battle fade away — a very effective method of setting the tone and cinematography.
The framing in this episode is carefully considered and used to great effect, particularly in the reintroductions of characters after the break between seasons. It is also effective in re-establishing relationships between characters: The exchange between Dinklage and Headey on either side of a barred window highlights their division in the aftermath of the last season. This kind of attention to visual detail is one of the reasons that this episode is so compelling.
On quibble: though the episode uses CGI well, particularly in the design and execution of the now-significantly larger dragons, there is one moment that ends the illusion and looks more fake. When Danaerys is off the coast of Astapor, the city’s walls and the sky appear a bit too unrealistic, which jars with her next appearance within the city walls.
Still, the season premiere of Game of Thrones lives up to the acclaim previous episodes received. It sets a very high standard for continued character development for the rest of the season, wraps up loose ends from season two and sets up various paths for interesting plot progression.
Season two, despite its drama and its whirlwind nature, was only the beginning of the war in which the characters now find themselves. And thankfully, the best of the series is yet to come: After all, “winter is coming,” and “the night is dark and full of terrors.”
I feel that is one of the such a lot important information for me. And i’m glad reading your article. However want to statement on few normal issues, The web site style is wonderful, the articles is in reality nice : D. Excellent task, cheers

Students for Palestine
Last week, University of Southern California’s Students for Justice in Palestine hosted Palestine Awareness Week to expose the struggles of the Palestinian people under prolonged, brutal occupation and oppression.
SJP is a graduate and undergraduate group of students of various faiths, backgrounds, and academic interests that stands in solidarity with the Palestinian people, who are struggling for peace and justice, and promotes awareness of fundamental issues of international law, human rights and basic standards of justice, and democratic principles essential to achieving a resolution.
SJP erected a wall in the Von Kleinsmid Center courtyard meant to represent the 26-foot concrete wall — referred to by some as a fence — that separates the West Bank and Israel, keeps families from one another, inhibits economic activity and usurps private Palestinian land. Throughout the week, lectures covered the separation wall, occupation, apartheid segregation, the structure of settler colonialism in Palestine and the medical needs of Palestinian women and children. On Wednesday afternoon, representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union discussed academic freedom, freedom of speech and law enforcement.
“Invasion is not an event, it is a structure.” UCLA Professor Gabriel Piterberg differentiated the two types of settler colonialism, indicating the traits of the structure that is practiced by Jews in Palestine.
“They want the land, they do not need the Palestinian labor,” Piterberg said. And for that reason, Israelis practice the pure settlement type — as opposed to plantation colonization — that systematically and institutionally discriminates against non-Jewish peoples.
Never mind the 5 million UN-recognized refugees and the thousands more that are continually being displaced, refugees who have the right to return under international law and yet have been prevented from doing so. This stands in stark contrast to the right given by the Israeli government for any Jew in the world to “return” and gain full Israeli citizenship.
Israeli policymakers are also intent on squeezing the 5.5 million Palestinians that live within Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip through hundreds of checkpoints within the West Bank, a siege on Gaza, house demolitions and confiscations.
I refer to the occupation of Palestine as colonization, as many scholars in the field do; they have come to realize that the asymmetry renders the situation radically different that the dual-nationalist struggle that has been claimed by both sides in the past. Palestinians are engaged in a national struggle in the face of Israeli colonization.
As a member of SJP, I work to support Palestinians struggling on a daily basis to exist in a place where their existence is perceived as a threat to a “Jewish state.”
I do not expect Americans to hold my views on what a final outcome of negotiations should yield. Rather, I take a stand for justice, equality and freedom for all Jews, Christians and Muslims, Israelis and Palestinians between the River and the Sea.
I want Americans to realize that the current situation renders negotiation futile and unfair. I want Americans to realize that U.S. policy enables the status quo in the face of overwhelming disapproval by most of the world’s population as reflected in the United Nations General Assembly. Last year, only the U.S., Israel and seven small nations voted against Palestinian statehood.
U.S. media is one-sided and inaccurate, excluding the Palestinian narrative. Thusly, Americans lack access to information on core issues, including the role of the U.S. in providing Israel with at least $3.1 billion in annual military aid. This does not include additional loan guarantees, weapons and crucial diplomatic support enabling the aggressive militarized colonization of Palestinian land.
Instead, I would like to see constructive U.S. policy that ends the country’s role as an enabler of conflict, fulfills its duty as an objective arbitrator and promotes regional peace.
The hostility received from passersby that were “pro-Israel” during Palestine Awareness Week did not nearly measure up to the amount of support that the USC student body expressed for the Palestinian struggle and SJP’s efforts to expose one of the greatest ongoing injustices — the colonization of Palestine. I speak for SJP when I thank everyone that came by “the wall” to show their support and seek information.

Senior, International Relations
Thanks for all of your irrelevant comments above.
This is the reason why Palestinian supporters are so persistent and motivated; we hear the lies and propaganda put forth to change the subject. We are trying to keep the discussion focused.
SJP exists not to engage with people like you, but to engage with the wider logical and reasonable American public at campuses across the country, Europe, and Canada, that are curious as to how we are supporting a regime of hatred and discrimination.
It would be so much easier to love, to respect, and to promote equality.
Peace.
and by “above” I mean below
“It would be so much easier to love, to respect, and to promote equality.”
………………….
You mean like this?
Official PA television—the PA’s PBS—airs programs that feature children as young as six reciting anti-Semitic and violent poems. Just months ago, for example, a little girl recited a poem that claimed, (and I quote) “[Christians and Jews] are inferior, cowardly, and despised.” Three days earlier, on a different program, another young girl insisted that (and I quote), “Our wars are for the Al Aqsa Mosque, and our enemy, Zion, is a Satan with a tail.”
This is apparently what passes for “educational television” under the Palestinian Authority.
From cradles to kindergarten classrooms; from the grounds of summer camps to the stands of football stadiums, messages of extremism are everywhere in Palestinian society.
In the international community, there is no shortage of individuals to lecture Israel about what it must do for peace. Yet these same “human rights advocates” stutter, mumble and lose their voices when it comes to criticizing Palestinian incitement.
Ignoring words and thoughts of hate does no favors to the Palestinian people. It does no favors to families who seek to build better lives for themselves and their children. And, perhaps most importantly, it does no favors to Palestinian leaders who advance the language of peace instead of the dogmas of hate.
Laying the groundwork for a stable peace in our region will not happen overnight. But those who would like to foster better relations between Israelis and Palestinians must start by speaking out against incitement in Palestinian society. The next generation—both Israeli and Palestinian—deserve no less.
……………
Seems to me it is YOU who is spreading lies and propaganda, not us.
“SJP exists not to engage with people like you, but to engage with the wider logical and reasonable American public at campuses across the country, Europe, and Canada, that are curious as to how we are supporting a regime of hatred and discrimination.”
If the above words were not so Goebbels’ like they would almost be funny.  The following two quotes are from the Palestinian Authority Daily, from an issue published just two weeks ago:
1.  “Churchill and Roosevelt were alcoholics, and in their youth were questioned more than once about brawls they started in bars, while Hitler hated alcohol and was not addicted to it. He used to go to sleep early and wake up early, and was very organized. These facts have been turned upside down as well, and Satan has been dressed with angels’ wings.”
And this:
2.  “Had Hitler won, Nazism would be an honor that people would be competing to belong to, and not a disgrace punishable by law.”
Almost all of the American aid comes back to the US to create jobs.
The wall is referred to as a “fence,” or “barrier,” because 95% of it is a fence. 
The only instance I know of, where the fence separated Palestinians from their land was Bil’in. The Israeli Supreme Court ordered the fence re-routed and that was resolved.
As Palestinian shahids massacred dozens of Israeli men, women and children in the early 2000s—at times almost daily, in discos, pizzerias, hotels, and on buses—the Israeli public cried out for a solution. 
The famed Israeli intelligence and military were rendered useless; despite all their efforts, they could not stop the carnage. People would shudder as they got on a bus, not knowing whether they would make it alive to the end of their ride. Daily life became a nightmare.
The right-wing Sharon government, which did not want to put any barrier between “Judea and Samaria” and the rest of Israel, was finally forced to erect the separation fence and the onerous checkpoints.
The bombings stopped cold. 
The attempts at murdering Israelis—“amaliyats,” which received the blessings of the vast majority of Palestinians—have never ceased. There are dozens of attempts every single month and the only things that stop them are the barrier, the checkpoints, and the intelligence-driven arrests.
The barrier placed 80% of settlers and 3% of the West Bank land on the Israeli side—land that under all negotiations and agreements was to fall under the Israeli state anyway. But for pro-Palestinian propagandists, this has been enough to call it an “apartheid wall,” a “land grab,” etc.
If you were an Israeli, would you rather be labeled a “racist” and stay alive, or would you rather have a good reputation but have your life turned into a living hell until one day you yourself get blown up into shreds?
This language, about “Israeli Colonialism” only serves to provoke hatred of Israeli Jews, does little to really help the Palestinians, and makes peace even less possible. It may lead to events such as the ones brilliantly depicted in Jonathan Bloomfield’s award-winning thriller, “Palestine.”
As this wall has been so successful in keeping Israelis safe, I wonder why  so many of them have moved onto the other side of it to say Khalil/Hebron, or at least 125 other settlements. There are at least a few hundred thousand Israeli Jews living in an area that has been deemed by the Israeli government too dangerous to not have a security wall separating it from Israel. Living by the so called “terrorists.”
This is a curious situation.
There is no “Palestine”. There might have been, but they chose war instead- time and again:
The would-have-been “Palestinians” would have had a state IN PEACE in 1937 with the Peel Plan, but they violently rejected it.
They would have had a state IN PEACE in 1939 with the MacDonald White Paper, but they violently rejected it (and Jews would have even been restricted from BUYING land from Arabs).
They would have had a state IN PEACE in 1948 with UN 181, but they violently rejected it (and actually claimed that the UN had no such mandate!).
They could have had a state IN PEACE in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza from 1948-1967 without any Jews- because the Arabs had ethnically cleansed every last one; but they violently rejected it. In fact, that’s exactly when they established Fatah (1959) and the PLO (1964).
They could have had a state IN PEACE after 1967, but instead, the entire Arab world issued the Khartoum Resolutions:
A. No peace with Israel
B. No recognition of Israel
C. No negotiations with Israel
They would have had a state IN PEACE in 2000 with the Oslo Accords, but they violently rejected it- as always.
And as soon as Israel pulled every single Israeli out of Gaza, what did the would-have-been “Palestinians” do? They immediately started shooting thousands of missiles into Israeli population centers, they elected Hamas (whose official platform calls for jihad with no negotiations until Israel is destroyed) to rule them, and they have dug tunnels crossing into the Negev to kill and kidnap Israelis.
And even afterwards, Ehud Olmert made his subsequent generous offer that went far beyond even that of Barak. The would-have-been “Palestinians” rejected it.
They had many chances.
They threw them all away because destroying Israel was higher on their priority list. It still is.
Oh well. That’s their choice.

In another story the Western media apparently refuses to cover, any Palestinian who dares to criticize Hamas or the Palestinian Authority risks being arrested or summoned for interrogation.
Palestinian journalists are now hoping to bring this to the attention of President Barack Obama when he meets with President Mahmoud Abbas next month.
The journalists say they want United States and the rest of the world to know that the crackdown on freedom of expression in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip is designed to hide the fact that Palestinians are governed by two repressive regimes that have no respect for human rights and democracy.
Official PA television—the PA’s PBS—airs programs that feature children as young as six reciting anti-Semitic and violent poems. Just months ago, for example, a little girl recited a poem that claimed, (and I quote) “[Christians and Jews] are inferior, cowardly, and despised.” Three days earlier, on a different program, another young girl insisted that (and I quote), “Our wars are for the Al Aqsa Mosque, and our enemy, Zion, is a Satan with a tail.”
This is apparently what passes for “educational television” under the Palestinian Authority.
From cradles to kindergarten classrooms; from the grounds of summer camps to the stands of football stadiums, messages of extremism are everywhere in Palestinian society.
In the international community, there is no shortage of individuals to lecture Israel about what it must do for peace. Yet these same “human rights advocates” stutter, mumble and lose their voices when it comes to criticizing Palestinian incitement.
Ignoring words and thoughts of hate does no favors to the Palestinian people. It does no favors to families who seek to build better lives for themselves and their children. And, perhaps most importantly, it does no favors to Palestinian leaders who advance the language of peace instead of the dogmas of hate.
Laying the groundwork for a stable peace in our region will not happen overnight. But those who would like to foster better relations between Israelis and Palestinians must start by speaking out against incitement in Palestinian society. The next generation—both Israeli and Palestinian—deserve no less.
•	Since the Palestinians were never Israeli citizens, and never wanted to be Israeli citizens, there’s really no question of Apartheid here.
The Palestinians’ disenfranchisement comes out of their own rejection of UNGAR 181, which advocated the establishment of one Jewish state (Israel) and one Arab state (Palestine, or whatever they might have wanted to call it) on the land of the Palestine Mandate. Had they accepted the resolution and established their own state on the land allocated by the UN, there would be no Palestinian refugees today.
No country in the world can be forced to accept a belligerent population whose manifesto includes the destruction of the would-be host country. Neither democracy nor membership in the UN requires any country to commit suicide, which is what you seem to be advocating.
If you really want an example of an Apartheid state, examine the laws of the Palestinian Authority– it is a criminal offense to sell Palestinian land to a Jew, and the maximum penalty for someone selling land to a Jew is death. Mahmoud Abbas has already declared on more than one occasion that “No Jew will be allowed to live in the new Palestine”.
How’s that for Apartheid?

Kiva announced last week that it has passed the $400 million milestone in microloans, a landmark achievement for an organization that relies on private donors to finance loans as small as $25 in developing countries.
Nick Cimarusti | Daily Trojan
This field, known as “microfinance,” has recently become immensely popular, inspiring similar movements across the nation. In 2009, New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof famously said, “Microcredit is undoubtedly the most visible innovation in anti-poverty policy in the last half century.”
For a business student, especially, it’s easy to want to believe that typically capitalistic fields like banking and finance can cause a positive social impact. But unless combined with other efforts, microfinance is unlikely to enact sustainable progress for those in developing countries.
The field of microfinance, which has benefitted more than 500 million people, has gained considerable popularity since Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for creating Grameen Bank, Forbes reported. Organizations such as Kiva, Accion and Grameen Bank have allowed people to take out small loans to support their businesses, even in areas where financial services are difficult to obtain.
The impact has been staggering. Grameen Bank alone is reported to have served seven million of the world’s poorest families, according to the Grameen Foundation website.
“Many see microcredit as much more than a financial instrument: it has been suggested that it has the potential to be entirely transformative,” Kristof wrote.
Yet, it wasn’t long until the backlash against microfinance began. Many questioned the use of the microfunds by lenders in rural areas. “Nine out of 10 microfinance loans are for consumption rather than to start or grow an enterprise,” said Hugh Sinclair, author of Confessions of a Microfinance Heretic: How Microlending Lost Its Way and Betrayed the Poor.
Although the statistic is shocking, the idea that families in poverty are likely to spend financial loans on basic survival resources instead of on burgeoning business is understandable. Nonetheless, the spending of microfinance funding on consumption goods rather than on businesses is contradictory to the message of the industry.
“There is a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding about what really is going on in microfinance,” Sinclair notes. “On the one hand, we hear of rumors of exploitation of the poor. On the other hand, good, well-meaning Americans and Europeans are donating and investing their money in this sector without really knowing what’s happening.”
In fact, reports of people in poverty caught in a circle of serious debt, as well as of people unable to repay debts with high interest rates, has drawn attention to the limitations of microfinance in a for-profit industry. While proponents of microfinance continued to defend the field, the criticism has become more and more severe. “On current evidence, the best estimate of the average impact of microcredit on the poverty of clients is zero,” said David Roodman, a fellow at the Center for Global Development.
Though it might be disheartening to hear, microfinance is most likely not the silver bullet to ending poverty. The underlying causes behind poverty are complex and based on a number of factors, not just financial stability or access to capital.
The potential of microfinance to make a difference can be severely inhibited by problems of organizational corruption, unsustainable accumulation of debt, high interest rates and other issues. Though microfinance might be a step in the right direction because it empowers people to start businesses, a multi-disciplinary approach to poverty reduction is a much better course of action.
Despite all these factors, the future of microfinance is bright. “World leaders should come together again to provide the powerful and visionary leadership to help steer microcredit back on course,” said Yunus, arguably the world’s leader in microfinance.
With the right insight and protection of microfinance institutions, such progress might be possible. They might not be the answer for impoverished nations, but socially responsible microfinance organizations like Kiva clearly have the potential to make a positive impact.
 
Payal Mukerji is a junior majoring in business administration. Her column “Risky Business” runs Tuesdays.
Kiva loans are not for $25, that is the amount you, the generous lender, can send to Kiva and then on-lend. The loans on the front page of Kiva today range from $1000 to $5000.
Suggesting that microfinance has “benefitted” more than 500 million is a loaded term, implying that it has had a positive impact. It has perhaps “reached” this many, but anyone with a credit card will confirm that simply spending money and paying your bill at the end of the month doesn’t necessarily make you any better off. The microfinance community is quick to point out the number of people “reached” and the % that repaid a loan. The evidence of it actually helping is largely absent. You cite Roodman’s legendary “zero” quote regarding the average impact such loans have on poverty – he is not alone is making this claim – see Chang, Stewart, Harper, Duvendack, Bateman etc. The evidence that microfinance eradicates poverty is entirely lacking other than courtesy of a few isolated claims supported by photos of women with goats, made by people whose salaries depend on microfinance.
Have you ever wondered how it is that Kiva are able to provide photos, loan details, little heart-warming stories about their borrowers, and yet cannot even state the interest rate of the loan? Think about this carefully. That Kiva even exists says more about the integrity of the US regulator than the effectiveness of microfinance.
You mentioned some of the classic criticisms of microfinance, but you missed the main concern. The vast majority of capital is chanelled through a handful of intermediary organisations such as Kiva, and the vast majority of information flowing back from the field to the ultimate investors is channelled through the very same people. These people earn often substantial returns for this churn. There is a catastrophic conflict of interest in the process. Economists call this the “principal-agent problem”. To remove the huge temptation to exaggerate the miraculous properties of microfinance genuine transparency and regulation is required. Very little of either exists, either in the developing countries where most microfinance takes place or in the developed countries where the funds largely originate. Until we resolve this problem don’t expect much improvement. And those who will most fiercely resist such regulation, or opt for a feeble self-regulatory body such as the Smart Campaign, will be precisely those with the most to gain from the current lack of any meaningful scrutiny over microfinance in practice.
Sheep need to be protected, and wolves are not good shephards. The microfinance sector is dominated by wolves. This is one of the main reasons why the results have been so poor to date. Controlling the wolves is the most pressing challenge we face if we wish to contribute to poverty eradication using microfinance.

Jan. 12, 2013: While everyone else started their second semester of college with their dorm rooms intact, friends by the dozens, and a better understanding of the real world, there I was hauling in my suitcases, clamoring for my hangable high school memorabilia and just starting to figure out how to use the washer/dryer combo without my mom’s help.
But I wasn’t alone.
I, along with several others, had just arrived at USC. We were the spring admits — students who were accepted to spring of 2013 during regular decisions because of limited space in the fall.
During the semester that we missed, some of us completed units at other colleges, others went abroad, and a few worked. Admittedly, enough Springies frequented USC for tailgates and parties in the fall that the administration could have allowed them to enroll sooner for their own sanity.
But in all seriousness, it’s hard not to feel a little resentment that us Springies couldn’t have come here sooner. Even after several weeks here, I still walk around marveling at the vibrancy of this campus. I still wonder if I’ll beeline to class like everyone else rather than stopping to stare at Bovard or Doheny. We undergo a transitional period while others seemingly have their friends, activities, and academics more set in stone.
It is incredible, however, to see so many Springies immersing themselves into campus culture despite the disadvantage of having missed out on the first semester. Some of the most active members of prominent organizations, Greek life, or clubs on campus are spring admits. From spending hours at dance practice or planning the next big event on campus, these students work so passionately toward their goals that it’s hard to tell that they only arrived on campus a few months ago.
Perhaps, it is this ambitious trait that defines Springies and allows them to thrive at USC. By taking the initiative to make a difference, missing out on the fall semester has been no setback.
But if you’re a Springie, and you haven’t exactly fallen on your feet when jumping into your first semester here, there’s no need to worry. There are still a lot of us — seniors, too — acclimating to college. So keep in mind that someone in the Trojan Family will always lend you a helping hand — whether it’s to put up dorm room decorations or to put life back together.

The Los Angeles Lakers find themselves in the unfamiliar position of having to fight for the eighth and final playoff spot in the NBA’s Western Conference. Despite their mediocre record this season, coverage of the Lakers has not been lacking, with a litany of talking points about the team dominating the headlines every week. Such are the problems that come with being one of the sport’s most storied franchises. One question remains relevant to round out the season, however: will the Lakers make the playoffs?
The reasonable man’s answer, at least at this point, is no.
The Lakers are trying to box out two other teams on the fringes of a playoff berth: the rejuvenated Dallas Mavericks and the persistent Utah Jazz. As it stands, Dallas has the easiest schedule on paper, but only by default. The Mavericks’ most difficult games include two against a Denver Nuggets squad which lost most of its fangs when their talented, tempo-pushing point guard Ty Lawson became sidelined with a torn plantar fascia.
The Jazz are picking up steam at the perfect time, and also have a favorable schedule to end the season, with two games against the Kevin Love-less Timberwolves and another against the aforementioned Nuggets.
That’s not to say strength of schedule is all-important. The Lakers have dropped games to presumed doormats, including a 23-point drubbing at the hands of the normally hapless Phoenix Suns and a loss against the Washington Wizards.
The Mavericks also have the reassurance of a resurgent Dirk Nowitzki. The franchise’s undoubted star has poured in more than 30 points twice in the past three games, including a 35-point blackout against a scrappy Chicago team last Saturday, where he shot 14-of-17 from the field, going 5-of-6 from beyond the three-point line. If this Nowitzki shows up down the stretch for the Mavs, it’s less of a question and more of a fact that the Lakers will end up watching the playoffs on TV.
Contrary to expectations, the return of the Lakers’ stars from injury has led to a funk, as the Lakers have dropped four of their last six games. The troubled nucleus of Dwight Howard, Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Steve Nash has been a curse in disguise for the team, whose four future Hall of Famers can’t play 48 minutes with one another without committing embarrassing turnovers, blowing defensive assignments and taking atrociously ill-advised jumpers.
Two teams appear to be showing signs of life at exactly the right time, while one team still can’t seem to establish its identity 74 games into the season. Being an avowed Lakers fan makes me hope I’m wrong, but the Lakers might have more than a mere identity crisis on their hands this summer.
Wow, standing at #2 in the power rankings, and with the 3rd best record in the NBA, I had no idea the Nuggets were so easy to beat, lol.  I see what you’re saying, that the Nugget’s bread-and-butter is speed and tempo, and without Lawson they are just not the same team.  Guys like Andre Miller however, while slower, also make clutch shots, and Fournier shows a lot of promise filling in at the point.  I’m not saying they are even close to the same team, but we have pieces in place to help us weather the storm until Ty gets back.  I’ve been using my DISH Anywhere app to keep track of the race out west, and with so few games left, it’s nice having all my TV at my fingertips wherever I go.  I work a lot of late hours at DISH and don’t get to see too many live games at home, but my new app works on my iPad, and I can take my live TV/DVR with me!  It’s crucial at this point, because any one game can change the Western Conference playoff scenario in a big way!
Dallas is going to make the playoffs!

The playoff chances for the USC men’s volleyball team were already slim before heading to Utah to face top-ranked BYU. Unfortunately, the team’s odds took another hit on Saturday, as the Trojan’s accuracy issues cost them once again in a one-sided defeat at the hands of the Cougars by a score of 25-14, 25-15, 26-24.
With only five games remaining in the regular season, USC (5-15) faced its toughest challenge of the season in Provo, Utah. The BYU Cougars have been among the most dominant teams in the country this season, amassing an impressive 19-3 record.
Led by All-American Taylor Sander, BYU is currently riding a 11-game winning streak that has earned the team a unanimous No. 1 national ranking. The Cougars’ high-powered offense, which leads the nation in hitting percentage, boasts victories over every team in the MPSF, including a win over USC earlier this season at the Galen Center.
The Trojans’ appeared able to keep pace with the Cougars at the start of the first set. Despite a few service errors early on, the USC managed to keep the game close. But after a kill from freshman middle blocker Josh Kirchner brought USC within two, the Cougars took control.
BYU went on a run, winning 12 of the next 15 points and overwhelming the Trojans with a 25-14 set victory. The attack was led by sophomore outside hitter Josue Rivera, whose three aces put the set out of reach for USC.
Aided by a sizable home crowd, the Cougars were able to ride the momentum from their earlier run to a quick four-point lead in the second set. This time, the Trojans were overwhelmed from the start and were unable to slow down BYU’s high-powered attack.
“I think we got carried away with the crowd,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “Not so much distracted, but I think we had a lot of guys who had yet to play in an environment like that. There were over 4,000 people there, and it was their senior night.”
However, the third set had a completely different atmosphere. After a quick break, USC came out of the locker room ready to play and quickly found itself with an early lead. While the Cougars continued to play aggressively, the Trojans successfully held them off for much of the set, pulling ahead by as many as three points. But, with the score even at 22 apiece, BYU pushed through and took their first lead of the set. Unfortunately, that was all the Cougars needed to put the Trojans away for good.
“As frustrating as the season has been, our guys have never backed down and they’ve always fought,” Ferguson said. “That goes for every day in practices and that goes for matches like this.”
BYU’s Sander came alive in the third set, tallying eight of his 17 kills. The junior outside hitter enjoyed an exceptional night on the court with a .762 hitting percentage and three blocks. USC freshman outside hitter Alex Slaught managed to put together a solid night as well, notching 8 kills and a .462 hitting percentage, but his play was overshadowed by Sander’s.
“[Sander] is the most gifted player in college volleyball, period,” Ferguson said. “You’re talking about a guy who can elevate and out-jump everybody. He’s basically a freak.”
While BYU certainly flexed their muscles offensively in this match, it was the errant play of the Trojans, once again, that virtually dictated the outcome. USC was outplayed in nearly every statistical category and managed only three aces on the night.
The loss puts the Trojans at the brink of elimination, as they now sit four games out of the last playoff spot with only four games left to play. USC will return to the Galen Center to play Long Beach State on Thursday, April 4 at 7 p.m.
Losing to the number one team in the country is no shame.  SC showed in the third set that they can play with anybody.  If they show up to play against LBSU as they did in the third set against BYU, the Trojans should be able to right the ship with a big victory.
Coach Ferguson has brought this program to the bottom once again like his mentor Turhan Douglas.
Terrible recruiting the last few years has produced mediocrity to the front line, and no real leadership
to the team. Now that Murphy Troy and Tony Ciarelli , and even Steve Shandrick have graduated
what is there left? The 1st assistant coach who is a former  ‘ruin has not helped bring a top player
into the program in his time with the Trojans. The old adage that the good news is everyone is back
next season, and that is the bad news too. Add this staff to the list for Haden to make a change in
the summer.
