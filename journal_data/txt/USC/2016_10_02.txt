The California Office of Emergency Services issued an earthquake advisory warning for Southern California on Friday in response to an earthquake swarm in the Brawley Seismic Zone near the Salton Sea. Residents of the area should be on heightened alert for the possibility of a major earthquake until Tuesday, the report said. 
According to the U.S. Geological Services, more than 140 small earthquakes between 1.4 and 4.3 in magnitude have hit the Bombay Beach area since Monday. The USGS said that the chances of a magnitude 7 or above earthquake are between 0.006 percent and 0.2 percent, with the chances decreasing over the course of the week.
“California is earthquake country. We must always be prepared and not let our guard down,” OES Director Mark Ghilarducci said to CBS. “The threat of an earthquake on the San Andreas Fault hasn’t gone away, so this is another important opportunity for us to revisit our emergency plans and learn what steps you need to take if a significant earthquake hits.”
The advisory was issued to residents and officials in Ventura, San Diego, San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange, Los Angeles, Kern and Imperial counties. If a large earthquake does occur, it could directly impact USC.
Many native residents of Southern California remember the effects of the Northridge earthquake in 1994. At 6.7 magnitude, office buildings, parking structures and parts of major highways collapsed, with some apartment buildings sustaining irreparable damage.
Since then, there have been numerous smaller earthquakes that have left minimal impact in the area. Carin Chin, a junior majoring in NGOs and social change, said that the frequency at which the quakes occur has desensitized her.
“Having lived in California for 20 years, my view on earthquakes has definitely been numbed, since they happen so often in small amounts,” Chin said.
While there may be a lack of concern on the part of native Southern California residents, students who are not from the area and not used to the frequent quakes, may have more reason to be alarmed. Anisha Mandhania, a graduate student at the Gould School of Law, said that her own exposure to earthquakes only served to heighten her awareness of the need for earthquake preparedness, rather than dampen it. 
“I experienced this extreme earthquake back in India some 10 or 15 years back,” Mandhania said. “It just happened all of a sudden, and afterwards there were smaller tremors for one month or so.”
For Mandhania, this experience solidified her belief that the California advisory is an important step in ensuring that everyone remains safe.
The Southern California Earthquake Center, which is headquartered at USC, researches earthquakes and looks for new ways to be better prepared in the event of a big one. USC also participates in earthquake preparedness drills at both the University Park Campus and the Health Sciences Campus.

Photo courtesy of Daniel ZhuReady, set, inspire · Participants lined up to register for the It Ends Here run/walk that took place at Pardee Plaza on Sunday morning.
Students gathered at Pardee Plaza Sunday morning for It Ends Here, a 2.5-kilometer run/walk aimed at raising awareness of sexual assault on campus. Forty-one sex offenses were reported in 2015, according to the Department of Public Safety’s 2016 Annual Security Report released Friday, a 32 percent increase from the year prior.
The event was held for the first time this year by the USC Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services and the Los Angeles Police Department in partnership with Trojan Marketing Group and the Undergraduate Student Government.
Runners were given teal bracelets to wear and filled out “Why I’m Running” signs to show their support. LAPD officers were also at the run. Officer Oscar Ibanez spoke to the attendees before the run began, thanking them for coming out and explaining the factors that lead up to sexual assault.
“It is a taboo subject which a lot of people don’t actually want to admit happens on campus,” Ibanez said. “Events like this are fantastic. It shows people that it does happen. Don’t be afraid to speak up.”
According to its event page, the run serves “to raise awareness, inspire the USC community to take a stand against this issue and show solidarity and support for survivors.” 
Katya Lopatko, a junior majoring in international relations, served as the organization’s project manager for the campaign. Lopatko and her team started planning the event last semester and created a promotional video for the campaign with the help of an animator.
“It’s really cool to see it in real life,” Lopatko said of the event turnout. “We were excited by how many views the video got and how many people were liking the page, saying they would come. It means a lot that people showed up and care about the issue.”
Eduardo Melchior, a senior majoring in business administration and management, serves as president of Trojan Marketing Group. He said that he experienced some challenges in the planning, but it was a very rewarding experience overall.
“Creating a campaign for such a delicate issue without offending anyone was challenging for me,” Melchior said. “But I believe we did a good job with reaching out to everyone in the community and coming forth to help.”
He believes that having an event in real life generates even more awareness than just a social media initiative.
“Having something around social media is good, but you eventually need one place where people see, physically, that there’s something happening on campus,” Melchior said. “We believe this can be a celebration where people can come together and show their solidarity against [this problem] and their support to end [it].”
Valerie Lopez, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, decided to run after seeing the event on Facebook.
“I’m running for the survivors I know at USC,” Lopez said. “I think it’s a really important issue that has affected a lot of people I know. It’s affected me.”
Lopez believes that awareness is the first step toward making progress on sexual assault.
“I think the more the school can do for the issue, the closer we’re going to be to ending it,” Lopez said. “I don’t think people are aware of how big of a problem it is. Hopefully people will talk about it more — this is the first step we can take.”
Joyce Lee, a senior majoring in public relations and sociology, also participated in the It Ends Here run/walk. She ran to combat the stigma of being a victim and show her support for her friends and others affected. 
“Sexual assault is an issue that’s very prevalent on all college campuses,” Lee said. “I have a lot of friends who have been very affected by it, but felt like they weren’t able to talk about it or be open to the issue because of the stigma associated with being a victim.”
Trojan Marketing Group will hand off the event to USG to run in future years. Lopatko hopes that the campaign will reach more students as it continues.
“I think our main focus was trying to spread awareness about sexual assault in a positive, empowering way,” Lopatko said. “We’re trying to emphasize that we have the power and responsibility, as USC students, to put an end to the issue on campus.”

Opening statements in the trial for the murder of a USC graduate student were held on Friday at the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. The jury began hearing arguments in the case of Alejandra Guerrero, 18, who was one of four teenagers charged with killing Xinran Ji.
Ji, a graduate engineering student from China, was beaten to death after returning from a study session on July 24, 2014, near the University Park Campus. The four suspects, Jonathan Del Carmen, Andrew Garcia, Alberto Ochoa and Alejandra Guerrero, pleaded not guilty to the charges later that year.
Though Guerrero was 16 at the time of the crime, she is being charged as an adult. According to NBC Los Angeles, the prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney John McKinney, stated that Guerrero was among the four teenagers who decided to rob someone near USC’s campus that day.
“They visited an act of violence on him that is so brutal that it is almost incomprehensible,” McKinney said. “They confronted him, they demanded money and then they assaulted him. The beating that he took was absolutely horrific.”
Guerrero’s attorney, Errol Cook, claimed that she wasn’t the leader and didn’t inflict the “death blow.” Cook claimed that the evidence shows Ochoa was the first to hit Ji, while Garcia was the first to chase him. 
“My client never punched Xinran, never caused a death blow to Xinran,” Guerrero’s attorney said.
McKinney stated that the victim had multiple skull fractures among other injuries. Ji left a trail of blood and made it to his apartment, where he was found dead by his roommate.
After beating the late student, the four defendants attempted to rob a couple at Dockweiler State Beach. They were caught and taken into police custody, which is when police discovered blood on Guerrero’s jeans that connected them to Ji’s murder.
Guerrero, along with the other defendants, may face a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. The other three defendants are awaiting trial.

The number of reported sex offenses at USC went up in the past year, though the number of reported rapes has decreased, according to new data released in the Department of Public Safety’s 2016 Annual Security Report. 
Forty-one total sex offenses — including 11 rapes and 28 fondling cases — were reported in 2015, compared to 18 rapes and 13 fondling cases the previous year. A footnote in the report explains that 12 of the 28 fondling incidents were carried out by one individual, who was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department and pleaded guilty to battery on school grounds for slapping girls’ buttocks on and around campus. 
The data showed that an equal number of rapes occurred on campus, in student housing and in a non-campus environment. Furthermore, two statutory rapes were reported on campus this year, which the report explains resulted from a California law that prevents minors from engaging in sexual intercourse, as neither can legally give consent.
Crimes reported as part of the Violence Against Women Act increased this year from 17 to 27, with the greatest increase in the number of stalking cases. The act, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994, dedicates special federal funding to addressing crimes against women.
The report indicated that the number of violent crimes in 2015 other than sexual assault stayed mostly the same from the year prior, with 12 reported robberies, nine cases of aggravated assault, and 29 burglaries. In 2014, 11 robberies, 10 cases of aggravated assault and 30 burglaries were reported. 
Cases of motor vehicle theft tripled this year, from six to 18, while arrests for drug violations rose from 18 to 32. The number of disciplinary referrals for liquor law violations remained high at 539, though a downward trend can be observed that shows referrals decreasing from 563 in 2013 to 555 last year. 
Three hate crimes were reported in 2015, of which the report said two were classified as simple assault with a bias of national origin while one was classified as intimidation with a bias of religion.
The University is required to report its crime statistics as part of the Clery Act, which mandates that crimes which occur within the geographic area of campus or are reported to a campus security authority must be disclosed by Oct. 1 of each year. Online versions of the 2016 and 2015 Annual Security Reports are available on the DPS website, while paper copies of the previous seven years’ reports can be obtained upon request from the DPS archives.
The Department of Public Safety was not available for comment.

Osa Masina, the sophomore linebacker suspended from USC in the midst of an investigation into sexual assault charges, made his first court appearance in Utah Friday and was ordered not to contact the alleged victim, according to the Associated Press. Neither he nor his lawyer objected to the order.
Masina appeared with his lawyer, mother and grandmother at the hearing, which lasted a few minutes, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.
Masina is charged in Utah with one count of rape and two counts of forcible sodomy for reportedly assaulting a woman who was unconscious after a party in July. 
Masina did not make a comment to reporters regarding the case. He replied with a short, “Yes, sir” to the judge’s inquiries.
According to court documents, he acknowledged having sex with the woman, but Greg Skordas, Masina’s attorney, said that it was consensual.
“The difference in accounts of what happened are maybe not as distinct as you might think, but I think the way both individuals perceived this is quite different,” Skordas told reporters after the hearing, according to the AP.
He is also under investigation in Los Angeles for allegations of giving the same woman marijuana, alcohol and Xanax and assaulting her at USC teammate Don Hill’s apartment. Skordas believes that charges will not be brought, however, due to the cell phone video evidence Masina sent to the alleged victim’s ex-boyfriend via Snapchat.
Masina is free after posting a $250,000 bail, but he and Hill — who has not been charged — remain suspended from the University while the case goes through the court system in Utah and the investigation continues in Los Angeles.

It was all Katie Johnson for the Trojans on Sunday as the team took down Oregon State 3-1, finishing off a victorious weekend in Oregon.
The Trojans took control of the game from the get-go, with redshirt senior forward Johnson finishing off a cross from redshirt junior forward Alex Anthony in the eighth minute. The offense found its rhythm quickly, and three minutes later senior midfielder and defender Savannah Levin fed a ball to senior midfielder Morgan Andrews, who found Johnson on the far post for her second goal.
The offensive pace didn’t slow from there. Johnson had two more shots on goal in the next 10 minutes alone, and at the end of the first half the Trojans had already taken 10 shots and forced Oregon State to make three saves. The attacking pressure allowed for the defense to push up, and redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme didn’t need to make a single save in the first half.
Heading into the second, the Trojans just needed to keep the offensive momentum built in the first half. Johnson did just that by earning a hat trick with a turn-around goal in the box, snatching a loose pass from a defender and finishing into an open net.
Sunday’s hat trick doubled the goals that Johnson has scored so far this season. The senior was forced to redshirt last season after an injury, but before that she was a scoring leader for the team. Alongside Anthony, Andrews and junior midfielder Nicole Molen, Johnson is part of the high-intensity offense that head coach Keidane McAlpine believes will give the team increased success this season.
As time wound down, the Trojans allowed a goal after a shot rebounded off the post and was cleaned up by the Oregon State attacking line. But the win marked the team’s ninth-straight win, leaving them undefeated in conference play. It was also the second career hat trick for Johnson, who now leads the team with six goals on the season.
This weekend’s wins will be crucial for the Trojans as they return home and prepare for next week’s matchups against Stanford and the Cal. Stanford is the top-ranked team in the nation, with highly touted players such as Jane Campbell and Andi Sullivan. Although the Trojans have been successful so far this season, back-to-back contests with Top 25 programs will test if the team is truly ready to compete with the best.
The only good hire made by former AD Haden to a program that was in a quandary.  Good luck against Stanford
this weekend.

It is amazing what a star quarterback and an aggressive, blitzing defense can do for a football team. There is no better evidence of this than USC’s win on Saturday night against the visiting Arizona State Sun Devils. While not perfect, the Trojans came out of the Coliseum with a victory against a quality opponent. That alone serves as a milestone in the Clay Helton era.
There are still a litany of issues plaguing the program, primarily a woeful offensive line. However, great players have a knack for covering up problematic issues. That is exactly what redshirt freshman sensation Sam Darnold is doing as he leads the Trojans at quarterback.
With the potential to join the pantheon of Trojan stalwart signal-callers like Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart, Darnold is clearly the latest prize from the Orange County area-prep pipeline for USC quarterbacks. His rifle arm has routinely made the exceptional look normal. Whether it was turning a failed trick play into a 40-yard gain with a flick of the wrist, off his back foot no less, or turning a broken draw run into a 15-yard pass gain, on Saturday, Darnold demonstrated he has “it” in spades. Whatever you want to call it: moxie, leadership or just that glimmer in his eye, Darnold is a revelation.
He’s still a freshman, so he isn’t perfect by any means. His pocket presence and decision-making will continue to improve, which is a truly tantalizing thought for Trojan fans. Comparing him to Palmer and Leinart, both Heisman winners, is admittedly a bit premature, but similar accolades may be in Darnold’s future, barring catastrophic injury. It’s now obvious why heralded quarterback recruit Ricky Town didn’t even last through summer camp last year — no one was beating Darnold for the job.
The thing Darnold brings to the table that other Trojan quarterbacks haven’t is mobility. It isn’t that he needs to break long runs. The threat of the quarterback run is enough to keep defenses honest. USC should know as they have been burned by mobile quarterbacks for as long as I have been watching them. One of my first unfortunate memories of USC football was Kansas State quarterback Ell Roberson carving the Trojan defense up and ripping it to shreds. It is nice to finally have a quarterback who is giving opposing teams a taste of the medicine USC has had to swallow for years and years.
The run pass option that has vexed USC defenses is now flummoxing opposing teams. USC still needs to work on the run aspect, as the Trojans’ worst play on offense is the repeated shotgun handoff to be stuffed a nanosecond later. However, the threat of the pass should continue to soften defenses up as the season progresses.
The dimension of mobility combined with his cannon of an arm and ability to stand strong in collapsed pockets evokes comparisons to NFL all-pros Aaron Rodgers and Andrew Luck. Again, only two games into the Darnold era; these comparisons are somewhat hyperbolic, but the young quarterback has routinely made the improbable seem natural. Only the best do that.
Darnold didn’t win this game on his own. The defense and their coordinator, Clancy Pendergast, deserve kudos for pressuring the quarterback and stifling a dangerous Sun Devil attack. Junior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu has stepped up for the Trojans and looks to have a career playing on Sundays very soon. Defensive backs senior Leon McQuay III and junior Jonathan Lockett also turned in impressive performances.
One area where the Trojans can make further strides is potentially moving sophomore Iman Marshall from cornerback to safety. His physicality and size leave him better suited for that position than in coverage where he seems to gets beat or commit pass interference each game. Marshall is too talented of an athlete to limit his immense potential being forced into the cornerback position.
On offense, Darnold was helped tremendously by junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and senior tailback Justin Davis. Davis, who had his original breakout game against Arizona State three years ago, finally looks to have regained his fluidity and graceful running style that makes him so dangerous and effective. He should be the Trojans’ workhorse moving forward. Smith-Schuster is back to dominating opposing defensive backs and making great plays after the catch.
The Trojans showed up on Saturday, and Helton deserves credit for rallying his troops and having his team come out with fire and intensity. I liked his decision to go for it on fourth down early in the game. The play call was lacking to say the least, but the aggressive decision set the tone for the game.

I still remember it vividly — on April 30, 2013, I was in a panic. With college acceptance letters haphazardly strewn across my bedroom floor, I felt totally lost as to where to spend my next four years. Though my entire K-12 education had built up to this moment, making a choice about my future before the deadline looming the next day seemed entirely daunting.
Endless pros and cons lists later, I decided on the University of Southern California over my other options. For me, the edge that USC carried was its numerous study abroad programs, spanning across more than 20 countries. It seemed like a culture was bred within the University in which students were highly encouraged to gain meaningful experiences overseas, outside a familiar classroom setting. Having never been anywhere except China, where I was born, and various parts of the United States on family road trips, USC seemed like the right choice to satiate my wanderlust dreams.
After almost four years and countless “there’s always next year” vows, my biggest regret during college thus far is not studying abroad. When friends come back from all corners of the world after a semester abroad, I can’t help but consider how limited my horizons are. Their networks have now expanded across continents and oceans, while mine is limited to my college circle.
Whenever people ask me where I would have gone had I studied abroad, I always answer South Korea without hesitation. Growing up in a predominantly white community, I was inundated with Hollywood movies and the Western ideal of beauty that they embody. With the advent of hallyu, or Korean Wave, it was especially powerful to see people that looked like me in the media.
Having Koreatown only miles away makes me feel closer ties to those values, and I realize how lucky I am to have Los Angeles as my college town. Vibrant, diverse communities make up the entire city, and every outing is a chance to learn more about different cultures. Koreatown offers a snapshot of what it would have been like to spend some time in South Korea.
During the fall semester of her sophomore year, a friend of mine studied abroad in Seoul, South Korea. Her parents immigrated from South Korea, but she was born in the United States.
“Being Korean, I definitely felt more tied to my heritage by studying abroad in the country where my parents grew up,” she said. “I’m so proud that I’m Korean, and my time there added to that.”
She took me around the neighborhood, highlighting her favorite places, some that reminded her of her time in Seoul, some that were unique to the area.
We first went to Quarters, a restaurant serving tapas-style Korean barbecue. Since the inception of Koreatown in the 1960s, Korean barbecue has been closely associated with the area, and Quarters certainly serves some of the best that I’ve had. We got the beef belly, bulgogi (marinated beef), galbi (marinated short ribs), beef brisket and pork belly, which were served alongside complementary side dishes and rice.
Our Korean barbecue excursion underscored the quintessential Korean dining experience. We prepared our food on the grill, round after round. We took our time and made sure we actually enjoyed our food. It was a much-needed change of pace that ran counter to my usual rhythm — most of the time in college, I eat on the go or in between commitments.
We then stopped at Okrumong for dessert. The spot serves traditional shaved ice in flavors such as black sesame and red bean. According to my friend, if friends or family members came to Los Angeles from Korea, this would be the place she would take them for the authenticity of the menu items.
The day ended with a trip to Touhmi, a Korean bar. Between soju drinks, we had standard Korean bar food, including the corn cheese and the Korean fried chicken. Popular K-pop songs filled the lounge, which was a great place for a large group of friends. Touhmi carried on the idea that food and drinks were central to conversation. A good time couldn’t be rushed.
For my friend, Koreatown is filled with whispers of her time abroad. Commercial establishments where she frequented, such as Paris Baguette, a bakery, and Tom n Toms, a coffee shop, can be found in the area. Her favorite restaurants carry the same, Seoul-inspired flavors. But she concludes that when she misses Korea, she can’t simply go to Koreatown to shed her nostalgia.
“If you can go to Korea, I definitely recommend it,” she said. “Koreatown is a great place in proximity to school, but my semester in Korea just can’t be substituted.”
For me, though, Koreatown, a mere 10-minute drive from my apartment, offers a brief picture of what Korea would be like. It’s not by any means an accurate representation of what the country would be like, but for now, it’s my own.

Photo courtesy of Fox MoviesPeculiar fantasy · Actress Eva Green (above), plays Miss Peregrine, in the fantasy-adventure film by famed visual director Tim Burton. The movie is based on the best-selling novel of the same name.
The new picture from the movie wizard Tim Burton takes the audience far away from reality, proving that the oddest things are applicable to any age and personality. Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children introduces the viewer to a sea of peculiarities. From young-society rejects to Miss Peregrine herself, peculiar people are empowered with more than just their powers. At this point, one might think the film is no more than a collection of curiosities carefully fitted into a bright mainstream picture by Burton. However, the narrative goes beyond special effects and visually attractive sequences.
At the beginning, the viewers are introduced to the young main character, Jake (Asa Butterfield), listening to his grandfather Abe (Terence Stamp) in awe, transfixed by stories about his fighting with the monsters in a magical place in Wales. From there, the story about the awkward teenager takes off into a masterfully crafted plotline of Jake’s adventures in which the abandoned orphanage led by Miss Peregrine (Eva Green) faces threats from creepy monsters and the main villain Barron (Samuel L. Jackson). Eva Green’s supple manners and magnificent appearances are enough to embellish any kind of movie, but in this film she goes beyond and performs with a combination of warmth and sadness.
As Jake explores the new world and spends time with his new friends — the girl with the jaws in the back of her head, the boy with buzzing bees inside of him and the girl floating like a balloon — Burton continues to churn out engaging scenes. The story has many faces, as the teenage boy comes to grips with not only the threats from the villain, but with his own unexplored inner world. 
He develops his personality far away from Wales, surrounded by funny and sometimes eerie creatures. While he evolves into a self-assured person, the plot plays a joke with the viewers, who may be lost between present and past. However, the interpenetration of bouncy and tragic rhythms throughout the film compensate for this slight confusion. These rhythms are appealing to both a mature audience and kids alike, as the story addresses controversial issues of growing up.
Butterfield’s performance proves to be a compelling delivery of the hero’s clumsy behavior and unflinching determination. Jackson brings horror into the narrative, with his character eating eyeballs as treats to keep himself human-like. As for the monsters — the director keeps clothes on them so that they have human features too. The child actors seem to fit the director’s penchant for freak characters, while Burton portrays their peculiarities in a moderate way in order to keep the story thoughtful. This attention to detail makes the movie fascinating and mass-appealing, as the tale contains both menacing and uplifting turns, filled with unforgettable visions.
Ransom Riggs’ young-adult novel seems to be a good fit for director’s tastes and skills. Burton uses his tricks from earlier pictures (Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands) to engage the audience and let the viewers pierce the tide of the euphoria while the characters are struggling in the imaginary world of peculiarities. The film is a hand-crafted and nurturing expression of Burton’s imagery, inviting the audience to join the trip to the spectator’s view of humanity.

Photo courtesy of Ashley Noel LongGrief and healing · Sophomore Ashley Noel Long (above) plays protagonist Caitlin in Mockingbird, a character who struggles with Asperger’s syndrome and understanding the world in the aftermath of her brother’s death.
A heart-wrenching examination of the need for human connection in the midst of grief, the USC School of Dramatic Arts’ production of Mockingbird last weekend told the story of Caitlin — an 11-year-old girl with Asperger’s syndrome — trying to navigate the world after her older brother Devon is killed in a school shooting. Directed with subtlety by Andi Chapman (an actress who has appeared in Switched At Birth and Glee), Mockingbird features a winning ensemble of characters as well as the stunning and nuanced performance of Caitlin by sophomore theatre major Ashley Noel Long.
Mockingbird was adapted by Julie Jensen from Katherine Erskine’s National Book Award-winning novel of the same name. Though Caitlin’s Asperger’s diagnosis is made clear in the context of the book, it is never explicitly stated within the play. However, in the play, through a series of appointments with the school counselor Mrs. Brook  (Anisha Jagannathan), the audience quickly comes to understand Caitlin’s ordeal: She has difficulty connecting facial expressions to feelings and has trouble figuring out why people act and say the things they do. 
For Caitlin, it is a constant struggle to function in a world that is not always “black and white,” much less maintain meaningful relationships with her father and her classmates after Devon is killed.
Caitlin is the protagonist, but she is also the lens through which the world of the play is built as such, the entirety of the production rested upon Long’s shoulders. 
For Long, her challenge was to carry the world of Mockingbird in her performance, and rise up to the challenge she did. Long’s performance was dynamite, to say the least: Her whole body involved in conveying Caitlin’s outbursts and breakdowns, as well as the more subtle mannerisms that characterize the life of a child with Asperger’s. 
“I never wanted to do an impression on autism and Asperger’s syndrome … And thus, it was vital for me to connect with the core of Caitlin,” Long said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
 In preparing for her role, Long researched the autism spectrum through several different podcasts and articles, but always kept in mind the deeply personal nature of embodying Caitlin as a character, not just someone affected by a disorder. 
“I needed to be present with her and speak the voice of the story,” Long said.
 The actress believes herself to be a warm and amiable person, and so “one of the most challenging [aspects] of the role was removing the core assets of myself that make me who I am.” However, she said that “becoming consumed with understanding Caitlin’s beautiful mind allowed me to understand myself, humanity, and the world around me in a deeper, more understanding light.” 
Part of making the play a product of Caitlin’s perspective is manipulating sound and visuals to make the world appear to be a scary place. A school bell may not seem jarring to someone without Asperger’s, but to Caitlin it is a jolting roar, and sound designer Stephen Jensen made sure the audience heard this, too. 
The backdrop of the play, composed of tiled walls, were utilized by scenic designer Grace Wang to demonstrate what Caitlin is seeing inside her head: definitions of words memorized from the dictionary, droplets of color, flashes of Devon’s face.
No part of Mockingbird would’ve been complete without each other. From beginning to end, from the set design to sound to performance, the production was a masterful lesson in the importance of interpersonal connection — even and especially in a time of devastation. 
“The community saves one another,” Long said about the characters in Mockingbird. “I believe that people are the best thing that can happen to one another, and I am inspired by this show’s generosity to teach a powerful lesson of understanding one another. The beauty of live theatre is that it allows an audience to understand this rare and beautiful lesson in such a short amount of time.”

Emilie Skoog | Daily Trojan
The 2016 presidential election marks a time in which transparency has never been so prominent as a narrative. Sen. Bernie Sanders first captured the attention of voters with his impassioned speeches about campaign financing and government corruption, from Wall Street to the halls of Congress. With Sanders effectively out of the race, the issue of transparency arises in public discourse less in the context of ‘big money,’ and increasingly in the context of the major candidates’ personal lives. Both presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have faced criticism for their reticence regarding their health and finances. In the firestorm of public commentary, the question left unexamined is why we insist on knowing these details of candidates’ personal lives. 
The most cited response to this question is “tradition.” The precedent of presidential nominees revealing his or her tax returns before election dates back to the Nixon era. When Donald Trump continued to refuse to reveal his taxes before November, he was the first major candidate in the modern era to do so. Trump has also refused to release his medical records, with the exception of a letter from his gastroenterologist who wrote, “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual elected to the presidency.” 
Following this ringing endorsement, the 70-year-old nominee has insisted that he will not disclose his complete medical records until his presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, does. Clinton’s quiet refusal to offer complete information about her health reached a climax on Sept. 11 when she nearly collapsed at an event and subsequently told the public that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier. This diagnosis has fueled unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Clinton’s health and further shrouded the 68-year-old candidate, questioned repeatedly about her transparency throughout this campaign, in a foggier cloud of mystery. With regard to Clinton’s finances, the mystery persists. Although Clinton has released her tax returns, the Trump campaign and other detractors continue to press both Hillary and Bill Clinton about their dealings in the Clinton Foundation. Embedded within this insistence on tradition is the assumption that we can finally ascertain the candidates’ characters and capacity to lead. These details of the candidates’ personal lives are treated as the last pieces of a puzzle that will help us finally decide who should be the next president.
The issue with this assumption is that we already know enough about the candidates. Whether or not Trump had released his tax returns would not have changed what we already know to be true about his character and capacity to lead. A ringing endorsement in a letter from his accountant cannot absolve a man who has belittled, body-shamed and mocked anyone who has stood up against his vitriolic campaign. He’s the man who said he would kill terrorists’ families and who has alienated millions of Americans with his racist, xenophobic rhetoric. Why does the public hear more about Hillary Clinton’s emails than Trump’s rape allegations? A clean bill of health will not change the fact that Trump has repeatedly shown little knowledge of foreign policy. Despite what anyone might think of Clinton’s character – —despite whether you believe she represents the lesser of two evils — one cannot discount that, in terms of leadership, she is perhaps the most prepared presidential candidate to ever win a nomination. 
Although experience is not necessarily an indicator of success, we would be remiss to not note the political experience Clinton has acquired in her lifetime. She was secretary of state for four years and served as a senator in New York for eight years. Having lived in the White House as first lady, Hillary knows what the day-to-day demands of being the president looks like better than any nominee. In the midst of such vast uncertainty, both domestically and internationally, Clinton represents the safest and most qualified choice for President of the United States.

In the contemporary world of higher education, the liberal arts core has slipped into dire straits. With the price tag of a university education increasing, combined with pressure on students to choose profitable areas of study in an unstable economy, the idea of education for education’s sake has become an increasingly foreign concept as a degree has become a prerequisite to earning a job. The liberal arts are being abandoned for the sustainable income guaranteed by an applied professional field.  While a degree in a profitable field can lead to a sense of long-term security, the value of the classical education must be remembered and its legacy upheld as higher education becomes more accessible and popular. 
 Most majors are not dedicated to rigid professions at the undergraduate level at Ivy League universities and top-tier liberal arts colleges. For many universities, the idea of a classical education is still a strong foundation of their undergraduate curriculum. Their philosophy would lend itself to the belief that universities serve ideals higher that trade schools. If university educations are solely utilitarian, then why don’t universities open undergraduate medical school programs and law programs? The answer: Because there is, in theory, much to be learned about life and the world itself before one learns about their chosen career path.
Without the liberal arts, we forget why we do what we do as a society and thus are unable to ask questions in regard to our roles and future directions. Majors in the professions allow students to become highly prepared and functional cogs in machines which already exist. However, with a liberal arts degree we are able to question the value of the “machine” and function thereof as a whole.
The goal of a liberal arts education is not the ability to hold a solid command of intriguing cocktail party conversation or to sound smarter than the person sitting next to you at the symphony concert. The root of the phrase “liberal arts” is derived from the Greek word “liberalis” or “worth of a free person.” It is the ability for one to be free to make own educated and informed decisions on how one wishes to live one’s own life. Armed with an informed understanding of the sciences, arts and humanities one is able to not only work with sectors of civilization but the building blocks of civilization itself.
 However, the waning popularity of the liberal arts may present a new wave of educational democratization. Once only a privilege reserved to children of elite families, a university education was meant as a practice with purely intrinsic value. There was to be no immediate return on the investment of a university education. The learning process was a time to learn about the world, not a time to master an industry. With the democratization of higher education and higher accessibility comes the pressure to make returns on the investment of higher education. We have begun trading the hard sciences for engineering, economics for business, English, history, philosophy, and political science for journalism, marketing and public policy.
 There is an era upon us in which universities will have to grapple with their pedagogical goals for the future. While the applicability of a degree is certainly an important component to consider, the value of a classical, well-rounded education is valuable enough to be preserved as higher education moves into the future.

Even as someone who isn’t from the country, I feel like I know Santa Monica. Don’t we all? We know the pier and the carnival rides, and the women that stroll along the beach in the heat of the day selling sliced mango and cheap towels. We know about the 3rd street promenade and the Brandy Melville store and Urban Outfitters and Real Food Daily and Ivy at the Shore.
We all know Santa Monica for its icons, but the truth is, that doesn’t even begin to cover what lies underneath. As entertaining as street performers and dinosaur shaped hedges are, living like a local in Santa Monica can be much more relaxed, laid back and enjoyable than you ever could’ve imagined.
