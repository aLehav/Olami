In front of a NCAA-record crowd of 11,925 fans, the No. 6 women’s soccer team traveled to Westwood last Friday to take on crosstown rival No. 5 UCLA, but fell 3-2 in overtime. 
The Women of Troy were looking for a rebounding win coming off a disappointing loss to top-ranked Stanford last week. 
“We don’t get a better teacher than this game,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said after his team’s loss to the Cardinal. “To get to play this game will prepare us for every game moving forward.”
The Trojans appeared to take McAlpine’s words to heart, seizing the early momentum against the Bruins. USC dominated possession, and when UCLA controlled the ball, the defense pushed the Bruins to the edges of the pitch and quickly regained possession. 
The Trojans opened the scoring early into the match. In the 11th minute, sophomore defender Julia Bingham launched a cross in front of the Bruins’ goal. In traffic, senior midfielder Nicole Molen elevated and landed a powerful header, sending the ball past UCLA goalkeeper Siri Ervik. 
Despite USC’s control on the game, the Bruins found the equalizer in the 26th minute. Sophomore defender Kaiya McCullough broke up the field past redshirt senior forward Alex Anthony and shot a long, rolling ball from outside the 18-yard box inside the far post to knot the score at one.
Just minutes later, the Bruins threatened to steal the lead from USC with a header on frame, but redshirt freshman goalkeeper Kaylie Collins denied the attempt, setting up the Trojans to go on the attack. 
The Women of Troy returned to the attacking third and strung together a series of scoring opportunities but were turned down on all attempts — until the 34th minute. Freshman midfielder Savannah DeMelo launched a corner kick into a scrum in front of the net. After a scramble at the goalmouth, the ball eventually found its way to Molen once again. The captain tapped in from point-blank range to record a brace with her fourth goal of the 2017 season.
“We knew that, on set pieces, they were weak, and we could exploit them there,” Molen said. “So I believe that’s where that second goal came from. It was just kind of bouncing around, and I just poked it in.”
The remainder of the first half was scoreless, and USC led 2-1 at the intermission. The Trojan offense was blazing through the opening 45 minutes, tallying nine shots while the USC defense limited the Bruins to just four. It seemed as if the Women of Troy had ironed out their problems from the Stanford game, but the bane of USC’s season returned in the second half. 
UCLA dominated possession in the second period, allowing the Trojans to spend very little time in the offensive zone and holding them to only two shots. 
In the 65th minute, a defensive breakdown resulted in a breakaway for UCLA redshirt sophomore midfielder Anika Rodriguez. One-on-one with Collins, Rodriguez sent the ball past the keeper to tie the score at two.
The match ended in a stalemate after regulation time, but overtime proved to be a short-lived venture. In the 92nd minute, UCLA’s sophomore forward Sunny Dunphy entered the Trojans’ box and played a backward pass to fellow freshman forward Ashley Sanchez. Freshman forward Tara McKeown was able to get a leg on the ball to change its course, but it was not enough as Sanchez’s shot found the back of the net for the game-ending golden goal.
“You hate to lose to your rival,” McAlpine said. “You hate to lose a game, but knowing that [we] have the postseason coming up, just like last year, we have a chance to redeem ourselves.”
USC fell 1-0 to the Bruins in 2016’s regular-season finale, but the team rebounded to reel off seven consecutive postseason wins — all the way to a national championship.
The Women of Troy conclude their 2017 regular season with a 14-3-1 overall record and an 8-2-1 conference mark. USC now awaits the NCAA Selection Show on Monday at 1:30 p.m. for the team’s seeding and matchup in the NCAA Tournament.

Eric He | Daily Trojan
You could sense the nervousness reverberating through the Coliseum.
USC had a 28-6 lead early in the second half, but Arizona quarterback Khalil Tate had come alive. And then, on a designed run from 32 yards out, Tate took the handoff, slipped past the tackle attempt of senior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu and then ran effortlessly right through redshirt senior safety Chris Hawkins and redshirt junior cornerback Ajene Harris into the end zone.
“Touchdown Tate,” yelled ESPN commentator Mark Jones on the television broadcast. “He detonates!”
It would be an explosion that kept going and going throughout the second half. Tate, the up-and-coming teenage phenom who has slipped into the Heisman conversation with his exhilarating talent and absurd stat lines since taking over the starting role five games ago, was bottled up for just 19 rushing yards in the first half. But he went off for 142 yards on the ground in the second half, having his way with a USC defense that could only hold him off for so long. He ran around and through the Trojans, which also opened up passing lanes for wide open receivers in the rare cases he actually dropped back to throw. 
Before you knew it, the Wildcats had reeled off touchdowns on four consecutive drives and tied the game early in the fourth quarter on a 2-point conversion, and you thought it would be another humiliating loss for USC — this time in the form of blowing a 22-point second half lead at home to an Arizona team that many predicted before the season to finish last in the Pac-12. 
Alas, thanks to late-game heroics by redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold and junior running back Ronald Jones II and a timely interception by Tate that showed that he is, indeed, human, the Trojans pulled off the win, keeping their chances at a Pac-12 championship alive and avoiding humiliation. 
“There’s never a question mark about these kids and how resilient they are, how prideful they are and how much they want to compete,” head coach Clay Helton said.
Sure, USC deserves credit for responding after Arizona tied the game at 35-35. It would’ve been easy to roll over and let the Khalil Tate Express keep chugging. 
“When we were up by a couple of scores, [quarterbacks coach] Tyson [Helton] and [offensive coordinator] Tee [Martin] were telling me on their headset, ‘Hey, be prepared. This game’s not over,’” Darnold said. “I knew that. We knew that.” 
Darnold and the offense delivered with two touchdowns, and Harris stepped up in the right place at the right time with a key interception. 
But, like most of their wins this season, it seems like the Trojans escaped Saturday night with a win behind their talent alone. Once again, they rode the arm of Darnold in the clutch — the sideline lob to Jones to set up the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter was one of the more spectacular throws he’s ever made — and the unmatchable downhill speed of Jones, who broke free for several electric long runs. Arizona may have come out with a much better game plan in the second half that USC had no answer for, but the Wildcats could not match the pure talent on the other side.
This game, in a nutshell, is why the Trojans are projected to play in the Fiesta, Cotton or Alamo bowls instead of jostling for a spot in the College Football Playoff. They struggle to put away inferior opponents, commit too many costly penalties and fail to inspire confidence that they belong in the same ballpark as the likes of Georgia, Notre Dame or Alabama. 
On Saturday, USC blew two red zone scoring opportunities in the first quarter, the first when Darnold couldn’t sneak for a yard on 4th-and-1, and the second when he threw an inexcusable interception with the ball at the one-yard line, underthrowing redshirt senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. 
“It was one of the worst mistakes I’ve ever made on a football field,” Darnold said.
Then, before halftime, USC had the ball in Arizona territory with a chance to go up by three scores, but two penalties stalled the drive, which ended in a punt. 
In all, the Trojans could’ve had three more touchdowns at halftime, points that would’ve gone a long way toward preventing the near-collapse that was the second half. Can you imagine if they had made those same mistakes against Alabama? 
And the penalties. They committed 14 penalties for 123 yards on Saturday, penalties that slowed the game to a near stop in the second half, allowing the Wildcats to seize on the momentum. The flags ranged from the undisciplined (hands to the face, holding) to the just plain unnecessary (excessive celebration, sideline warnings, unsportsmanlike conduct on Helton). It is Week 10, and somehow, the Trojans are still shooting themselves in the foot.
An optimist might say that Trojans still control their own destiny — Helton’s favorite catch-phrase — and have a good chance at playing for the Pac-12 Championship. But it seems like, week-to-week, even after wins, USC is breathing a sigh of relief that it avoided an upset, avoided embarrassment for another week. It seems like, instead of winning games, the Trojans are playing not to lose. 
That’s what this campaign has come to — relief that Khalil Tate didn’t carve USC up enough to spoil its season — which is not exactly what we thought would be the main takeaway from Week 10 before the season began, back when the Trojans had deeper aspirations, like winning a national championship.

The USC Marshall Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation hosted its first ATHENA Women’s Entrepreneurship Summit on Thursday, an event focused on the empowerment of female entrepreneurs, from the acceptance of different definitions of success to the in and outs of investing. 
The event kicked off with a welcome address from Lloyd Greif Center Director Helena Yli-Renko. Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare, was the inspiration for the summit’s name, Yli-Renko explained. As a warrior who was known for her compassion for others, the goddess was a fitting namesake, she said.
Yli-Renko also discussed female underrepresentation in the workplace, stating that in the realm of entrepreneurship, there is still much to be done about gender equity.
“Women own 42 percent of all businesses, but only 3 percent of companies receiving venture capital have female CEOs,” Yli-Renko said. “We’re here to spark dialogue on issues and topics that are relevant and important to women entrepreneurs on their own entrepreneurial journeys.” 
Amanda Daflos, director of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s innovation team, also emphasized the necessity or female leaders in a male-dominated workforce.  Female leaders are not hard to come by, Daflos said, and they deserve the support and respect from others. 
“Diverse workforces are more productive and innovative, and they make products that appeal to broader audiences,” Daflos said. “Also, we know it makes a difference when young girls see a doctor, city councilwoman, entrepreneur … They see someone who is just like them.”
The speeches, panels and workshops encompassed a broad range of topics related to entrepreneurship, like happiness and creativity.
One panel, titled “Everyday Hustle as an Early Stage Entrepreneur,” highlighted the initial challenges that came with starting a company from the ground up.
 In the panel, five female C-level executives discussed the pros and cons of founding a business, as well as juggling their working lifestyles while deciding to start families. Chewse CEO Tracy Lawrence, a USC alumna, said that running a company causes her to constantly assess herself as well as the overall culture of her company. 
“You are building what the team cares about, so Chewse is a ‘love company,’” Lawrence said. “I care about being emotionally intelligent at work, and all my managers care about that, too.” 
Panelist AngelaSutherland, the CEO of Hello Yumi, noted that in order for women entrepreneurs to succeed in the future, they need to be more willing to support each other via networking, which for her seems to be more male-dominated. 
“Men have [a] million opportunities to build a network,” Sutherland said. “The CEO will go to a baseball game with an intern, but women wouldn’t go shopping together because [to them],  everything sends a signal. But that makes for a world where networking is just built-in for males.”
The rest of the event included a performance by soul and folk singer Victory Boyd, as well as remarks from Marshall School of Business Dean James Ellis. 
After the summit came to a close, attendees participated in a networking reception, building relationships with fellow business leaders. 
According to Umamah Syeda, founder of virtual relocation service GuideMe and a USC alumna, the event inspired thoughtful dialogue among female entrepreneurs.
“It’s amazing to connect with people who are in the same game as you,” Syeda said. “We were talking about how this is still kind of a man’s world, and to be able to appreciate yourself within that is amazing.”

The Children’s Data Network at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work played an important role in the development a new statewide social welfare program. The Emergency Child Care Bridge Program, which will go into effect in January, is a $31 million proposal to increase financial assistance and services for foster children and their families across California. 
“It’s an example of all the work that we do at the Children’s Data Network,” said Jacquelyn McCroskey, co-director of the network. “We develop agreements and partnerships with agencies that serve children and families and then we look at where you have overlapping population. We were very interested from the beginning in early childhood education because we know that … participation in high quality programs can really stimulate child development.” 
 The funding for the bridge program was approved earlier this year when California’s budget was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. The program aims to increase access to early care and education services for foster children and will give foster care families with six-month emergency child care vouchers if they are taking care of children from birth to age 5. 
The program will also help social workers and families find long-term child care, fund support for parenting youth in the child welfare system and increase trauma-informed training for child care providers. 
The network helped develop the program by linking administrative data from different systems that serve foster children and their families, McCroskey said. This allowed the program’s developers to better understand the children who are being served by multiple sectors, and the interaction between families and communities. 
Through a partnership with the Child Care Resource Center, the Children’s Data Network was able to develop a relationship with the California Department of Social Services as well as the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. This allowed the network to study children who were served by both systems — the child welfare system and the subsidized early childhood education system.
“There is very little information about children served by both the systems,” McCroskey said. “The fact that we can do it for even one part of L.A. County turned out to be quite important, because what we were able to show was that there actually is a good deal of overlap between children served by both the systems, and nobody really knew that before.” 
Through the Bridge Program, the network is trying to improve the relationships that already exist but aren’t always recognized. According to McCroskey, the lack of adequate support for foster families has been a recurring problem in California, because finding adequate child care is an issue in households where both adults work. 
Genie Chough, assistant deputy director of external relations at L.A. County DCFS, was another key figure in developing the Bridge Program legislation. The average cost for a toddler in a child care center in California is more than $1,000 per month, she said.
Child care is most important, Chough said, because strong evidence points to the positive effects that an early education gives for children. 
“Those effects are exponentially greater in kids who have been abused and neglected,” Chough said. “The secondary benefit of the program is that it not only helps the kids, but also their caretakers, because child care has been a barrier for the foster parents.”
Maria Romero, the DFCS child care program director, said that L.A. County is developing plans to provide better services for foster families.
“We do recognize that there is an issue,” Romero said. “But we are diligently addressing those issues so that we have a stronger network connection with the [foster] resource families.” 
To address these issues that the foster families have been facing, CDN, along with the Child Care Resource Center, published three policy papers that demonstrated the link between child welfare and early childhood education.
According to McCroskey, there is a disconnect between the child care systems and families interested in utilizing services.
“Any family who loses support, who loses a job [or] who experiences some kind of an unexpected family crisis can be referred to the child welfare department,” McCroskey said. “I just believe that there was probably a lot of going back and forth between these systems that we just didn’t understand.”

Through an international collaboration, USC’s electrical engineering doctorate students received hands-on instruction about a new technology known as Software Defined Radio. 
All electronics, like cell phones, computers and TVs, are radios, defined by the different types of hardware they run. With SDR, one type of radio can be turned into another type simply by downloading new software. 
“I once heard SDR described as ‘the stem cell of radio’ — I can’t think of a better comparison,” Bhaskar Krishnamachari, a Ming Hsieh faculty fellow in Electrical Engineering, told Viterbi News. “Imagine a device that can operate as a cell phone, Wi-Fi device, or FM receiver for bluetooth, simply by choosing how you program it.”
USC’s venture into SDR started in 2010, when Marcelo Segura, a professor of electrical engineering at Argentina’s San Juan University, came to work with USC engineering professor Bob Scholtz on developing technologies. Scholtz holds the Fred H. Cole professorship in engineering and was one of founders of USC Viterbi’s Communications Science Institute in 1982.
After returning to Argentina, USC electrical engineering professor Hossein Hashemi convinced Segura to return for two more years, to help Ph.D. students and faculty build the University’s first SDR. 
Earlier this year, Segura returned to teach students about SDR technology and other new technological theories. Segura said he believes SDR has the potential to act as an equalizer for research, allowing developing nations and other organizations to complete research with the impediment of expensive hardware.
“SDR allows you to do prototyping really fast and cheap,” Segura told Viterbi News. “The same piece of hardware can act as Wi-Fi, LTE or any other radio, meaning that smaller companies can do more research without the big war chests that global companies have access to.”
Though Segura is no longer at USC, he continues to work with Krishnamachari and other USC faculty to develop new technology, according to Viterbi News. In the future, Segura said he hopes to return to USC to further his research and continue teaching students about new SDR technology.

Eataly, a global Italian marketplace chain, opened its first West Coast location in Westfield Century City on Friday afternoon.
On Friday, Nov. 3, Eataly Los Angeles celebrated its much anticipated grand opening in Westfield Century City. This location is the first Eataly branch on the West Coast, with other American locations in New York City, Boston and Chicago.
Upon arrival, visitors were handed maps to navigate the massive three-story Italian food emporium. Food stalls with a variety of olive oils, cheeses, breads, gelato and wines surrounded the 67,000-square foot space.
Eataly, a global chain with locations from Istanbul to Seoul, is known as the largest Italian food hall, cooking school and restaurant in the world. The New York Times describes Eataly, created by Italian businessman Oscar Farinetti, as a “megastore” that “combines elements of a bustling European open market, a Whole Foods-style supermarket, a high-end food court and a New Age learning center.” It offers local products from farmers across California as well as high-end Italian products.
Eataly Los Angeles boasts nine food stalls, four restaurants, two cafes and two bars. The four restaurants are La Pizza & La Pasta, La Piazza, Il Pesce Cucina and a yet-to-be-opened rooftop restaurant.  Il Pesce Cucina is a seafood restaurant run by chefs Michael Cimarusti and Donato Poto.
While the second-floor marketplace contains over 10,000 items for sale, the first floor holds a coffee shop, a gelato area. a yogurt-making station and a cooking school by Lidia Bastianich, 
Eataly Los Angeles is also the first location that offers outdoor seating.
At the mozzarella lab, chefs intricately prepare the cheese by hand in front of all the guests to try. Made every day with whole milk from local dairies, the tenderness of Eataly’s mozzarella is unparalleled. The butchers cut the cheese with enthusiasm, shouting out phrases in Italian to excite patrons.
The cooking school offers classes on how to recreate beloved Italian dishes. Some upcoming events include “Back to Basics: Gnocchi alla Sorrentina,” “Hands-On Egg Pasta” and “Back to Basics: Lasagna alla Bolognese.”
The main attraction of the marketplace is the pizza alla pala, also known as a traditional Roman-style pizza. It is made with a long-fermented dough that is hand-shaped and hand-stretched and baked directly on the stone floor of an oven heated to 580 degrees Fahrenheit.
It might have taken three years for Eataly Los Angeles to finally open, but the wait was well worth it.

Crazy Rich Asians is the Hollywood breakthrough film that Asian Americans need. Nothing gives me greater joy than seeing Asian actors Constance Wu and Henry Golding on the cover of Entertainment Weekly, decked out in extravagant jewelry. In an era when Hollywood gives ethnic minorities #OscarsSoWhite, Kevin Kwan’s glamorous film adaptation is, hopefully, further proof that Asians should not be typecast any further in mainstream media. Although there’s no teaser trailer yet, Warner Bros has announced the film’s release date to be in August 2018. 
What I love about the premise of the film is it showcases diversity in the Asian American experience. As the protagonist, Rachel, portrayed by Constance Wu, explores her boyfriend’s high-society life in Singapore, she’s faced with a strong culture shock as she attempts to fit in with the “crazy rich” lifestyle. Even though she has Chinese roots, Rachel’s return to Asia is a different reality than what she previously expected.
Despite the significance of the protagonist’s culture shock, Kwan previously shared that a producer tried to whitewash Rachel’s role by changing her into a white girl. Time and time again, producers, directors and film executives have completely diminished the value of a cultural story by selecting actors that are seemingly marketable to an audience.
As an American-born Asian like Rachel, the Western myth that perpetuates the continent has given me a preconceived picture of my parents’ country, Vietnam. It’s beautiful, people have told me, but it’s also a developing country. The Western narrative has made the Eastern world exotic and strange, yet Crazy Rich Asians, Kwan said, is his introduction of contemporary Asia to a North American audience.

And why the buzz surrounding this film? Crazy Rich Asians is the first film featuring an all-Asian cast since The Joy Luck Club in 1993. 
Media representation is a step forward in celebrating the diversity of Asian culture. Crazy Rich Asians takes place in Singapore, an island colonized by the British, which holds a diverse Asian population. Around 75 percent of Singaporeans are Chinese, with Malaysian, Indian and Eurasian minorities. 
We can’t predict what will happen at the box office yet, but with films showcasing a largely underrepresented demographic, there’s the potential that the target audience will flock to the theaters. 
Take for example Girls’ Trip, a successful summer comedy featuring four women of color. There’s also the anticipation of Black Panther from Marvel Studios next year, which features a compelling cast and plenty of action and energy. Finally, The Lion King’s action remake just released a high-profile cast with protagonists played by Beyoncé and Donald Glover.
As more and more studios are viewing the successes of diverse casting, it’s time that Asian American actors, producers and directors also get their time in the limelight.

Let’s not ignore the fact that this movie cast a half white guy who wasn’t even a actor! for the leading man of this film, and all the actresses in this film are asian females with white boyfriend/husband, and the ones that whine about not getting cast are also asian female with white husband. Let’s not ignore the fact that they perpetuate white privileged, white worship, self hating, the model minority stereotypes. It’s not progressive & “woke” as you think. To think the director is asian yet cast a half white & full of asian woman w/ white partner. 
The leading actress in this film, even though known for being outspoken about issues regarding Asians in the media. She has exposed her hypocrisy, her greed and her fake activist image for approving normalizing mail order bride and sex trafficking as long as the asian actress gets a certain amount of money. See they’re all “sjw” because it’s trendy now and they want to be applauded for being “woke”. They speak up so harshly & brave now, but None of them ever talk about such things before, and bts some of them are dating a white racist (looking at you Chloe Bennet and dating racist Logan Paul). Asian American actors, especially actresses are usually the theater whitewashed kids in high school, all of them grew up or probably still lowkey self hating and white worshiping individuals.. it’s no surprise.

Emilie Skoog | Daily Trojan
USC is not nationally known for its culture of student activism, yet in recent years it has joined other campuses around the nation in hosting a new wave of student demonstrations. These protests vary in topic from combating institutional racism to opposing President Donald Trump’s actions on immigration. 
Across the nation, students feel empowered like never before: marching, giving inspirational speeches, making snarky signs and sharing it all on social media. Change seems to hang in the air as the protests are happening. But then, the protest is over and everyone packs up and goes home. Every now and then at some colleges, a university official or two is fired or a building is renamed, but core issues in terms of policies and who is representing us on the state and national levels remain the same.
All of which is to say, it is often difficult to figure out the true, institutional efficacy of a protest. If student advocates truly want to make a difference at USC and other campuses worldwide, they must have a good understanding of how to organize effective and persuasive demonstrations that spur tangible change. 
The first step for would-be demonstrators is to settle on a goal. Student movements often have a variety of interrelated, yet distinct aspirations. Some are quite limited in scope. For example, earlier this year at Yale University, students petitioned specifically for the re-naming of a campus residence college named for former Vice President John C. Calhoun — an avowed white supremacist and pro-slavery advocate. 
If a protest has one specific aspiration, the demonstrations’ effects are pretty straight-forward and measured. In the case of Yale, the university relented after some time and changed the name — an unequivocal win for the students who launched the protest. 
However, protest movements are rarely so clear-cut. Often demonstrations are made up of people advocating for a variety of issues rather than a singular goal. This could be seen at the Women’s March — attended by a number of USC students — in Los Angeles and around the country, which began as a feminist rally, only to end up representing a whole host of progressive concerns. Demonstrations that demand broader change are often more difficult to measure in terms of direct effect.  
Beyond measuring a movement’s effectiveness in terms of the changes that it makes, it’s also important to consider how a protest can be advanced into the next steps. Looking to successful national protests can give student advocates the tools to organize more long-lasting, effective protests. Researchers and sociologists have identified a few key qualities that all rewarding demonstrations have in common.
A first rule among sociologists is to craft a powerful message that resonates with the public. For a social movement to be fruitful, it has to grab the attention of the population at large, rather than just niche groups. In an interview with Vox, University of Pennsylvania sociologist Daniel Q. Gillion found that on average, every time politicians become informed of 10 protest events happening in their district, they become 1 percent more likely to support a bill that favors a protester’s position. In essence, the longer a protest lasts and the more relevant its message, the more likely people in power are to respond.      
A second but no less important rule is a commitment to nonviolence. The point of protest is to pressure those in power to impact change and gain support from the wider population. If the movement is viewed as overtly violent, many in the public will oppose it. Indeed, Stanford sociologist and researcher Rob Willer told The Atlantic that radical protests spur a “disidentification effect” on bystanders, causing them to disassociate with the marchers and view their complaints as illegitimate. 
In addition, Gillion argues that violence plays right into the hands of the enemies of the protest. He contends that “protest can embolden politicians to stay the course, and conservative politicians like Trump might be emboldened.” A whole right-wing media ecosystem exists waiting to weaponize any slip-ups on liberal-leaning demonstrators’ part against them.   
Ultimately, members of any movement must have a big picture in mind. While reactive, organic protests are all the rage, real change requires organizers to plan ahead. They have to pick their battles and effectively channel the public sentiment in the right direction. In a piece in The New Yorker, Nathan Heller writes that the civil rights movement was a “masterpiece of control and logistics.” To gain traction during the bus boycotts, organizers “bided their time, structuring, and planning what amounted to a work of public theatre” centering on Rosa Parks and the court case Browder v. Gayle. Parks was vetted by the organizers beforehand to withstand the media spotlight she would face. The result of their deliberateness was a roaring success — Parks was portrayed sympathetically on television and segregation on buses was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.     
All and all, in this time of upheaval and unrest, student activists can play a decisive role in shaping the national conversation — that is, if they learn from the past.
I think you brash college students should work a job/career, pay bills, get into real relationships, not hookups, and stop fixating on your smartphone or social media, for at least a decade after leaving college. In other words, enter the real world; gain real world experience, wisdom before you pontificate what’s right for society. Then, decide if you want to play social justice warrior, spew white-guilt rhetoric, etc. I know you want to feel relevant and feel more alive since you’re young. But like the saying goes, you’re young, dumb, and full of….Yeah.

Nithya Rajeev | Daily Trojan
Last week marked the spring class registration period for a majority of Trojans. The usual Snapchats of “streak” or faces with triple chins were replaced with pictures of packed green schedules inviting pity. But accompanying these messages were condescending comments by STEM students of the, in their words, “empty” schedules of students in other colleges. This comparison of schedules, and mockery of those whose course loads mandate fewer hours in a lecture hall or lab, speak to a larger problem omnipresent in the USC community. 
One of USC’s academic pillars is its emphasis on interdisciplinary study. In fact, one of the main reasons I chose to attend this University was the unmatched opportunity it offered me to pursue a biology degree, a law-related minor and a passion for journalism. 
I stem, pun intended, from a high school which primarily emphasized science and math courses. Though technically considered electives (implying choice), it was abnormal to have graduated without having taken at least one course between AP Biology, AP Chemistry or AP Physics. In short, I hated this environment. As an editor for my high school newspaper, I constantly felt as if the fields not falling under the “STEM” category were underappreciated and misunderstood. As a result, like the needle of a compass drawn north, I was strongly attracted to the promise of pursuing this spectrum of interests in a more accepting setting. 
Yet, I haven’t always felt that inclusion. Whether in USC’s official memes group on Facebook or through conversations with peers, the feud between STEM and liberal arts majors is as defined as — if not more than — it was in my high school. And, as with most divisive and stereotype-based issues, both the problem and the solution lie with us. 
I will be the first to admit that I too have found myself frustrated with friends who don’t have three lab classes, or those who can still graduate in four years with a couple of 12-unit semesters while I struggle with 18-unit semesters. But if anything, this frustration is not with others, but with ourselves. Temporary stress due to midterms or lab reports is understandable and even healthy — it shows you care. It is a symbol of your ambition and your desire for success in your field of interest. However, persistent frustration, which manifests itself in the form of criticism of those you perceive to have it easier than you do, reveals a deeper insecurity in your own major and choices. If you can’t find that passion for your major within yourself, then the problem exists with you, not with the entire subset of liberal arts or STEM majors. 
The solution to this is, once again, easier said than done, but achievable nonetheless. We must make appreciation our first response. We need to appreciate the work students in different fields create that we enjoy. We need to respect the time and effort they put into achieving perfection in their respective fields, whether or not this time is spent in a classroom or in lab on Fridays. 
The world thrives on diversity and improvement, and if the opposing fields were as easy or irrelevant as we have portrayed them to be in social media or daily conversation, then they would have ceased to exist several years ago. The fact is that they are thriving, more so now than ever before, and just as much as any other field considered to be more advanced. Rather than emphasizing one end of the subject spectrum, we must embrace it as a whole and refrain from convincing ourselves that the side we have picked is of greater value to society.
