Black Girl Magic.
That’s what I witnessed when the Cardinal Divas graced the Colosseum stands with their debut performance. More than magic, it was Black Girl Power. To watch history, Black history, be made at a place like USC in such an uplifting way made me prouder than ever. As a Black person, I was simply overjoyed. 
There aren’t a plethora of spaces on campus for us. We make up barely 6% of the student body as of the Fall 2021 semester, but that comes as no surprise at a predominantly white institution. However, a majorette team here? That’s revolutionary.  
Here is my argument and I will always stand by it: Anything positively amplifying Blackness is worth celebrating. We as Black people should take it as a win anytime we come together and celebrate a Black experience, especially in a white space. 
That perspective made the split in opinion among the Black community regarding the Divas disappointing. The sole premise of the debate was based on comparisons between Historically Black Colleges’ and Universities’ culture — the whole PWI v HBCU dispute. Many argued that the Cardinal Divas were stealing from HBCU culture, that there are multiple HBCUs that have long been doing this and never got the attention USC has and that if these women wanted to join a majorette team they could have attended an HBCU.
To address the first allegation, I don’t believe the Cardinal Divas stole anything. Stealing implies that HBCUs lost something from USC making a team. They didn’t. They are also not the first majorette team to start at a PWI: UC Berkeley’s Bearettes blazed that trail in 2019. I can understand a cultural appropriation argument, but not in this case of Black women embracing a form of HBCU culture outside of the HBCU space. These aren’t intruders. These women simply love to dance in this style, the same as other Black women like them. What’s wrong with that? 
There is an overall argument of fear that the dance and history of majorette will be watered down if introduced to a white audience. Because Black dance and culture have no doubt been appropriated over the years, I can understand where the fear aspect plays in viewing this as a possible issue. There is the idea that if majorette dancing lost its footing in HBCUs, it would transform as it expands to different PWIs. 
But fear is not fact. Fear should not be a reason as to why we don’t allow other Black women to express themselves in the way they know and love best. Many of the Cardinal Divas have been majorette dancing since they were little. And college is truly a bubble; Black students can continue to maintain authentic traditions of the dance much more easily here than in the grandiose realm of overall society. These are Black kids having fun during college, can we not make it deeper than that?
Being that almost all USC students support the Cardinal Divas (because duh, they go here), I asked my cousin Dejah Fleurancois, a junior at Howard University and active member on campus, her thoughts. Honestly, I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t tripping! 
Many students can’t just attend an HBCU that easily because of the costs and notorious lack of scholarships these schools usually offer. So “it’s still important that Black students are able to get the Black experience wherever they are,” she states. That was the thing I thought everyone in the Black community would agree on. 
The Jennifer Hudson Show hosting the Cardinal Divas intensified the existing criticism — a prominent point regarding recognition. The Cardinal Divas is among the first of its kind in terms of majorette dancing at a PWI, so naturally one has to understand why it would receive heightened attention over its usual iterations at HBCUs. 
Still, credit wasn’t given where it was due. There are many HBCU students, like my cousin, who do fully support a majorette team at USC, but it was important to address the history and origins of the dance at HBCUs — especially since they were given a larger platform and exposure than incredible HBCU majorette teams that have existed for years before them. Dejah posits that credit should have been given because “There would be no existence at USC without HBCU influence.” She’s right.
My initial thoughts on the backlash were since when did tradition place a higher priority over our race? When did HBCU culture trump Black culture? That’s what got me. Black people attending a non-all-Black school suddenly are not welcome to engage in a Black form of expression? Seriously, it’s not us against us, it’s us against white institutions, let’s not forget that.
The valid criticism is just acknowledging where the Cardinal Divas came from: a remarkable history of Black women before the 1960s starting their own revolutions at their HBCUs. Now the Cardinal Divas began a revolution before our eyes. We as Black people shouldn’t be blind to that. Instead, we should be celebrating — anytime and anywhere Blackness is celebrated.

The University announced Monday that they received an $8.8 million grant that will support sustainability research initiatives. The grant — composed of settlement funds from a 2016 class-action lawsuit — will support the USC Urban Trees Initiative, USC Energy Institute and the USC Dornsife Microbial Greenhouse Gas Consumption Research Center.
USC is one of over two dozen institutions receiving funding from the class-action lawsuit and the projects will advance the University’s sustainability measures.  
The USC Urban Trees Initiative is a program intended to build healthy, climate-resilient neighborhoods through the development of an urban forest in Los Angeles. University experts and the City of Los Angeles are leading the initiative with the goal of overcoming environmental inequalities throughout the community. 
Marianna Babboni is a project manager for the USC Dornsife Public Exchange, which develops social impact projects — including the USC Urban Trees Initiative — between the University and outside organizations. Babboni explained the importance of trees to the health and safety of those living in an urban city. 
“Trees are a cost-effective solution to reducing temperatures, improving air quality and providing safe recreational spaces for Angelenos,” Babboni said. 
Babboni also addressed temperatures in L.A. which she said are rising at an accelerated rate and pose a threat for transportation throughout the city. Hot days can cause the pavement to reach temperatures of 140 degrees, which releases harmful pollutants in the air, according to Yale University and Carnegie Mellon University researchers. 
“It’s dangerous for walking conditions, for young and elderly populations to pursue recreational activities,” Babboni said. 
The grant will assist the initiative in determining where trees should be planted throughout L.A., based on need and benefit. It will also aid in research to test tree performance and resiliency. The University will allocate funding to plant and maintain approximately 400 trees for three years. 
Since its fruition in 2020, the initiative has thrived through the help of students. 
“USC students have been absolutely critical to this work,” Babboni said, adding that she hopes many other students become involved with the initiative during the three-year span of the grant. 
The USC Energy Institute is a USC Viterbi School of Engineering center that hopes to promote the development of faculty research programs concerning energy-related innovations. 
California’s energy needs have grown and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power have little room for energy storage, said Donald Paul, executive director of the USC Energy Institute and a research professor of engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering. To combat these growing energy needs, Paul said the institute is conducting research to develop methods to store large amounts of energy in idle wells through the subsurface. 
Paul provides business development, support and mentorship for faculty and students regarding energy transition to develop a low-carbon future. Paul said there are many abandoned wells throughout Southern California in residential and commercial areas.
“What is unique [to] really anywhere in the world, is we have all of this infrastructure now in the middle of this 10 million person metropolitan area,” Paul said. 
According to the California Department of Conservation, if left unsealed, these abandoned wells can be harmful to groundwater and public safety. 
Paul, in collaboration with Viterbi professor Iraj Ershaghi, will begin conducting field experiments in the San Joaquin Valley beginning Spring 2023.  
Jan Amend, professor of earth sciences and biological sciences and divisional dean of the life sciences at USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, leads the USC Dornsife Microbial Greenhouse Gas Consumption Research Center.
The new center will research microorganisms and their ability to transfer greenhouse gasses — such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide — into non-harmful waste. 
“Understanding and harnessing this microbial power will lead to novel solutions in the fight to mitigate climate change,” Amend told USC News Monday.
In light of the Office of Sustainability’s recent “Assignment: Earth” framework campaigns — including Green Week and Earth Week — students have noticed a difference in the University’s sustainability efforts under President Carol Folt compared to previous administrations. 
Alisha Soni, a junior majoring in environmental studies and non-governmental organizations and social change, is a sustainability supply chain research and analysis intern with the Office of Sustainability.
“Compared to the previous administration, this administration led by President Folt has put sustainability initiatives at the forefront of their agenda,” Soni said. 
Soni assists with the calculation of the University’s carbon footprint as a result of food distribution, then uses the data to develop ways the University can reduce its carbon footprint. Soni hopes to connect people to resources they don’t have access to and ensure the wellbeing of the environment and the people who live on the planet. 
“I think that over the last few years, the science behind environmental issues — whether that be climate change, food insecurity, land degradation or renewable energy — has kind of taken more of a forefront role in peoples’ jobs and in peoples’ minds,” Soni said.  
Soni believes sustainability research is discovering methods to incorporate sustainability into our everyday lives, but also applying a sustainable approach to our ecosystem. 
“There’s a lot of environmental issues that are really pressing in L.A., especially in the South Central community, in terms of pollution and food deserts,” Soni said. “Research in those areas will be beneficial to directly address the needs of community members.”
Natalie Black, a fourth-year student studying dentistry, is president of the Ostrow Sustainability Group,  a student organization committed to implementing sustainable practices into the dentistry and medical communities.
Black, who completed her undergraduate education at the University in 2019, said sustainability was not a priority during the previous University administration.  
“We truly need to be working together to practice [and] live more sustainably to better protect our planet and our future and our kids’ future,” Black said. 
Black also said sustainability research is important because there is so much that needs to be added to the field — such as how we can live and work more sustainably. With a scientific background, Black said she believes research is the backbone of sustainable innovation.
“The fact that we got this funding is awesome,” Black said. “I feel like in undergrad, I would not [have expected] this to happen.”
President Folt spoke about the University’s commitment to sustainability efforts during the University Park Campus State of the University address in April. In her statement, Folt explained her concern for environmental solutions. 
“We are turning our concern into action, starting right here at home,” Folt said. “As an environmental scientist — I know how interconnected our environment is, and that we must take a comprehensive and integrated approach if we are going to find lasting, scalable solutions.”

The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority released the results of the 2022 Homeless Count, which show a slight uptick of homelessness in Los Angeles. As the first city-wide Homeless Count conducted since 2020, the results suggest that homelessness may be rising more slowly than in previous years.
At the time that the count was conducted in February, there were 69,144 people experiencing homelessness in the county of L.A. — a 4.1% increase from the data collected in 2020. In the city of L.A., there were found to be 41,980 people experiencing homelessness — a 1.7% increase from the data collected in 2020.
This growth is less severe than that from 2018 to 2020, where the county and city saw a 25.9% and 32% increase in homelessness, respectively.
Ben Henwood, an Associate Professor at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and expert in health and housing services research, annually teams up with L.A. county to produce estimates for the Homeless Count. To collect the data, a team of researchers gather surveys among people experiencing homelessness in the area, and analyze numbers collected by volunteers. These numbers are then combined and analyzed to produce the annual estimate.
“It’s not a perfect science, and the numbers are often contested. But when we calculate, we do provide the error that we think is involved in the estimates,” Henwood said. “So, sort of plus-or-minus, I think this year the numbers report that there was a slight increase … if you look, statistically speaking, they’re sort of unchanged from 2020.”
This year was the first to utilize an electronic data gathering system, through which most of the obtained figures were imported into an app that made the different facets of the data easier to understand and analyze.
Brenda Wienwel, a USC alumna and ex-faculty member appointed by the Dean of the School of Social Work to help with an initiative to eliminate homelessness, said that the coronavirus pandemic both decreased the number of volunteers willing to participate in the count and possibly made it more difficult to locate homeless individuals.
“Because of COVID, a lot of people who … had been on the streets for a while were going in and out of shelters, and the city started up sweeps where they were going into areas and clearing them,” Wienwel said. “That caused a lot of dislocation on the part of people who were living in the community … so I think what ended up happening is it may have been harder to find people.”
Wienwel also credits the pandemic for an influx in funding to house people — at least temporarily — and increase resources that worked to reduce the number of evictions.
Henwood agrees with Wienwel, believing the pandemic introduced new programs that may be linked to the relatively stagnant growth rate of homelessness in the county, like Project Room Key that allowed unsheltered individuals to stay in hotels or receive an increase in unemployment benefits. Despite this, Henwood thinks the major driving factors of homelessness remain.
“[A lot of homelessness] has a lot to do with housing affordability, inequality, institutional racism, and those things [didn’t] somehow fundamentally change during the pandemic,” Henwood said.
Due to the coronavirus, no data could be collected in 2021; Henwood said that the 2022 collection process was also impacted by the lasting effects of the pandemic.
“It was a lot more challenging to do a survey-based count when things like drop-in centers where we often might collect surveys were closed because of the pandemic,” Henwood said. “Our ability to estimate … in large part relied on our ability to do surveys at Family Solution Centers located throughout the county, but a lot of these had limited hours or were closed or people were reluctant to go in.”
There is a general acceptance that homelessness is one of the most prominent problems that Los Angeles faces — in order to effectively address the issue, there needs to be a more uniform approach to determining solutions, Henwood said. 
“There’s not one person in charge. County supervisors play a large role, probably a more significant role than the mayor in terms of deciding about funding,” Henwood said. “So there’s a lot of people in charge, and they all have different political pressures.”
Some people believe investing in affordable housing is the preferred solution, while others vouch for building more shelters or sleeping encampments.
Henwood also noted that there are various initiatives within USC to research homelessness and find solutions. The Price School of Public Policy hosts the Homelessness Policy Research Institute that convenes researchers and policymakers to examine homelessness through data and empirical sources, the Keck School of Medicine created a street medicine team to help homeless individuals with their health concerns, and USC launched a certificate program on ending homelessness where students can learn about effective ways to tackle the issue.
Wienwel thinks it is important to recognize that homeless people want to be housed, but oftentimes there are simply no options.
“The whole system is stuck because you can’t have temporary housing unless you have permanent housing at the end,” Wienwel said. “You can get people off the street, but they’re going to end up right back on the street within a very short period of time unless there’s someplace else for them to go … that would meet their long-term housing needs.”
According to Henwood, there are vast health disparities between homeless populations and housed populations — another reason why it is integral to promptly find solutions. Homeless individuals tend to experience premature aging, and have an average mortality rate two decades earlier than the general population. 
“Generally speaking from a public health perspective, homelessness is a real issue,” Henwood said. “It’s awful for the people in the population, but it can definitely have consequences for the larger population in terms of communicable diseases spreading.”
Antonio Okeke, a senior at USC studying Public Policy and pursuing a progressive degree in Public Administration, thinks that effective remedies for homelessness comes from a willingness to make sacrifices and introduce new policy, like rewriting zoning laws.
Okeke also said that USC should be taking more legitimate steps to address the issue.
“There [are things] being done to educate students, but at the same time, I just feel there’s a whole bunch of communication … at the back end that then makes it harder for students to take action,” Okeke said. “And oftentimes, that action might be performative, not just on the students’ end … but also from administrators.”
Wienwel believes that USC has introduced effective projects that have helped contribute to the slowing spread of homelessness, but still, there is more to be done.
“It’s one thing to say we care about homelessness, and we’re going to train our folks or we’re going to focus on research … and that’s an important task that the university has done well,” Wienwel said. “But in general, contributing to the actual stock of housing, in addition to housing students, would be good.”

With one month left until election day on Nov. 8, Bass and Caruso’s upcoming debates and campaign pledges will play a more critical role as polls among registered voters suggest a closer race than expected. Both candidates have outlined their plans to address the Los Angeles homelessness crisis as well as their stances on recent measures impacting unhoused Angelenos.
Rep. Karen Bass — a 2015 graduate of the Peck School of Social Work, and whose endorsements include Sen. Bernie Sanders, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and both of California’s Senators — laid out her intended policies on homelessness on her campaign website. Many of her plans focus on long-term, permanent housing solutions paired with services supporting job training, mental health treatments and substance abuse solutions. 
Bass said she would identify available properties and partner with religious and corporate groups to build shelters, and pledged to “cut through red tape, expedite approvals, waive development fees and work with the community to build more permanent housing.” She also pledged to leverage already-available funds through Proposition HHH, Mayor Garcetti’s $1.2 billion bond tripling annual supportive housing production.
Opponent Rick Caruso’s plans on his campaign website have a more immediate focus, emphasizing his pledge to build 30,000 interim housing units in 300 days. He also said he would work to prevent future encampment sites, create financial incentives for the city to greenlight affordable housing construction and turn tiny houses and some city-owned properties into housing options.
Teya Hisel, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law and global studies, founded advocaSC, a club focused on policy approaches to the L.A. housing crisis. She reminded voters to consider what these policies might actually mean for unhoused people.
“Caruso’s platform says [that] they want to get everyone off the streets, but what [prioritizing immediate shelter] translates into is more often than not [police] sweeps and the further criminalization of unhoused folks,” Hisel said.
Hisel also spoke against “false assumptions” of homelessness, explaining that moving unhoused people directly into shelters is not necessarily better for them than being on the street.
“For a lot of people, going into a shelter means you might lose your personal property, you might lose your pets, you might not feel any kind of safety or security and it can be a re-traumatizing experience for a lot of folks,” Hisel said. 
Bass’s platform emphasizes administrative responsibility, including mayoral accountability and her pledge to appoint a homelessness chief to “personally drive action at City Hall.”
To transition unhoused populations into housing, Bass wants to employ “trained neighborhood service teams” including outreach and social workers and health professionals. She noted that both employing previously unhoused persons and creating social support services to help with this employment can create jobs. 
Caruso has promised to declare a state of emergency on the crisis and hire 500 additional caseworkers to help with job training alongside Caruso’s promised job apprenticeship program, which supports unhoused employment with the support of local providers and unions.
Caseworkers would also help provide medical and mental health services. Caruso’s platform promises to additionally form both a Department of Homelessness, with a citywide homelessness coordinator and a Public Health Department to provide healthcare to unhoused Angelenos.
Peck School of Social Work Professor Benjamin Henwood noted the importance of identifying the homelessness crisis as “a real public health issue.”
“We do see huge health disparities, we see people dying two decades earlier who are on the streets,” Henwood said. 
A 2021 UCLA report found that the average age of death for unhoused people is in the mid-40s, while the L.A. County life expectancy is 82 years.
“So much of the conversation is highly politicized that a lot of this kind of gets lost, but there is plenty of research that’s done and we actually have some pretty effective solutions,” Henwood said.
To prevent homelessness, Bass looks to expand housing vouchers, incentives for landlords and homelessness prevention measures to address root causes of the crisis. Caruso pledged to expand emergency rental assistance and prohibit evictions if tenants make a “good faith rental payment,” though he has not explained what constitutes such payments.
After the L.A. City Council voted to end the moratorium on evictions effective Feb. 1, 2023, Bass expressed concern. 
“If those supports all go away, then the [homeless count numbers] are going to dramatically increase because people will literally be put out of housing and out on the streets,” Bass said on Oct. 5.
Caruso has not yet commented on the vote but said at the Sept. 21 debate he would edit the moratorium to include more rights for landlords.
Neither Caruso nor Bass has expressed support for the popular United to House L.A. measure, which appears on the ballot next month. The measure would implement a “mansion tax,” which would apply an additional 4% tax on properties that sell for between $5 and $10 million, and a 5.5% tax on those above $10 million, with funds going toward affordable housing and other related measures such as acquiring rental properties.
Bass’ spokesperson told the L.A. Times Sept. 30 that she was undecided on the measure and sought analysis on how the city uses the $1 billion currently going towards homelessness. Caruso also told the L.A. Times he prioritizes proving to the public that the city can “utilize these funds effectively and efficiently.”
In addressing homelessness, Hisel encouraged voters to look into other political offices on the ballot.
“The city controller race is going to be really interesting for housing and houselessness, and housing policy in general,” Hisel said. 
Hisel supported Kenneth Mejia’s platform, which she said focuses on “building more affordable housing, on expanding access to services, [and] on making sure that the city has the budget.”
Peter Monti, a second-year dual masters of public planning and urban planning candidate and vice president of Trojans for More Housing, emphasized empathy and education in acting on the homelessness crisis.
“The experience of being homeless can be very traumatizing and we want students to be empathetic, or at least sympathetic,” Monti said. “Everyone deserves survivable places to live. It’s being as aware as you can for whatever policies are being offered on the table, to be cognizant of that when [voters] make their decision.”

It was Oct. 2 of a distant 2005 when all of Mexico was paralyzed; the national team had just won a FIFA tournament. Yes, this now seems like a far-fetched dream or a best-selling fiction novel. At the time it was an astonishing achievement for a team not recognized as a powerhouse in world soccer. 
While this was the World Cup tournament held in Peru for the Sub-17 youth level, it still meant a promising generation was soon to come for the Mexican National team. 
A young Hector Moreno lined up as center back, Omar Esparza moved the chords of the midfield and a dynamic duo with Giovani Dos Santos and Carlos Vela tag-teamed the attack. These players, led by head coach Jesus Ramirez, would make their way to the final, beating national teams such as Uruguay and Australia in the group stage. In the knockout stages, they strolled past Costa Rica and the Netherlands all to conclude in the Cup final against Brazil with a 3-0 victory. 
Quickly, the names of the previously mentioned athletes became well known in the Mexican soccer world, leading them to sign for top-tier clubs. Vela would start his career with Premier League Arsenal FC in the 2006 season. Dos Santos would also try his luck in Europe, starting at the youth teams of Barcelona’s academy La Masia. Esparza would quickly continue his success with a Liga MX league title at Chivas just a year after the world title. 
This was the trailblazing generation, Los Niños Héroes, named the “Children Heroes” after the six young cadet soldiers who gave their lives for Mexico City towards the end of the Mexican-American War. In fact, they were such trendsetters that six years later the Mexico U-17 team would repeat the feat, beating Uruguay 2-0 at the Azteca Stadium. 
But, what happens to these teams when they reach the World Cup stage after these youth processes?
It is certainly a different environment. The numbers at the gate are astronomically different, television deals shape the experience and the powerhouse teams are more dominant at the adult level. 
At a youth level these players were all trying to make names for themselves. Back then, they would be barely starting to play for the youth academies of their respective clubs. Now, we tend to see various youth players debuting with the adult team at as young as 18 years old.
Take Marcelo Flores, who debuted for the Seleccion Mexicana this past summer at only 19 years of age. The process has now sped up and athletes want to compete as soon as possible, yet this does not help build the strength the team needs to raise the World Cup. 
Mexican fans, and I count myself as one, tend to have a very positive outlook when it comes to soccer. But as soon as one thing goes wrong, we forget positivity and choose to sack the current coach. That is the issue with the Mexican Soccer Federation, where the coach lasts at most three years with the national team. 
We saw this with Juan Carlos Osorio, who led the Mexican team to the 2018 Russia World Cup without any hiccups in the qualifying process, winning 6 matches, drawing in 3 occasions and only losing one game. Mexico beat the reigning champion of the time, Germany, with a single goal by Hirving “el Chucky” Lozano. 
Osorio turned down a contract extension, ending his three year term with Mexico with a record of 33 wins, 10 losses and nine draws.
Certainly there are a lot of issues with the system of Mexican soccer. They erased the promotion-relegation system, taking with it the stronger competition of the local league. However, the biggest issue is the lack of continuity of coaching staffs at the helm of the national team. 
The key is longer processes, where the coaches can develop a style and a project for not just one World cup, but two or more. Jose Peckerman had six with the Columbian national team, Vicente del Bosque gathered 8 years of experience with Spain and Joachim Löw had a tenure of 15 years with the German team. In that regard, Mexico can learn from other soccer powerhouses in order to make their dreams of lifting a world cup turn into reality.

162 games take place between Opening Day of the MLB season and the final pitch, making the season one of the busiest in professional sports. This season was a long, unpredictable roller coaster ride as always, but Trojan baseball fans should be excited about how one playoff series in particular shaped up. 
Beginning this Friday, the Philadelphia Phillies will travel to St. Louis to take on the Cardinals in the wild card round of the MLB playoffs. The series will showcase two great teams who have seen plenty of exciting storylines play out in their successful seasons. 
But, one storyline in particular has Trojan fans buzzing. Each of the teams boasts beloved Trojan baseball alumni, outfielder Lars Nootbaar of the Cardinals and catcher Garrett Stubbs of the Phillies.
Trojan fans have watched the careers of both players blossom over the course of the season, in completely different ways. 
There was a lot of buzz surrounding Nootbaar heading into the season. He had shown flashes of brilliance in his brief rookie appearance in 2021 and captured the hearts of many Cardinal fans. The Cardinals hoped he could carve out a regular role in 2022. 
However, a crowded outfield made it difficult for Nootbaar to get opportunities, and when he did, he couldn’t hit. His average was .091 at the end of May. As a result, he shuffled back and forth between the Cardinals and the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. 
But, Nootbaar climbed his way out of his slump, which manager Oli Marmol credits to the energetic outfielder’s upbeat attitude. His hitting turnaround, coupled with an uptick in opportunities due to injuries, led to Nootbaar becoming a regular starter in the summer months. 
He ended up with a respectable .228 average with 14 home runs, 40 runs batted in and a 2.2 WAR. 
Now he factors heavily into the Cardinals postseason push, as he is likely their best healthy outfielder on the roster. 
The Cardinals relied on the consistency of him and others as they rode a steady tide of winning to a divisional title and a #3 seed. 
In the other dugout, Stubbs also carved out a regular role for the first time in his career. Stubbs debuted with the Astros in 2019 and spent three years with Houston. However, he never stuck in a regular role and had similar hitting struggles to Nootbaar. 
The Phillies traded for him prior to this season, in hopes that he could become their backup catcher. With the Phillies having one of the best catchers in the league, JT Realmuto, in their starting catcher role but without an apparent backup, Stubbs finally had a defined role if he could play well enough to keep it. 
He played far better than anyone expected. Stubbs hit .276, an exceptional average for a backup catcher. 
He also had one of the best viral moments of the entire season. In a game against the Marlins on June 15, Stubbs stepped up to the plate with 2 outs in the bottom of the ninth inning and his Phillies losing 1-0 and blasted a walkoff 3-run homer into the right field seats. 
At that moment, Stubbs couldn’t contain his excitement and passion. As he began his home run jog, he spiked his bat into the ground and hyped up his teammates in the Phillies dugout before running around the bases with a smile on his face. 
The moment went viral because it was clear that Stubbs cared so much for his team and their success. It was clear that Stubbs loved the game just as much as anybody in the league. 
It turned out to be an important win as well. The Phillies needed every win they could get in their playoff push, as they were the last team to clinch a spot in the postseason only days before the season ended. 
Now, the two fan-favorite, fun-loving former Trojans who are both having their best seasons yet will share the field in a pivotal series. 
Nootbaar and the No. 3 seed Cardinals are seeking to make one final playoff push with their longtime core of Albert Pujols, Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright, while Stubbs and the Phillies are seeking to make their first playoff berth in 11 years worthwhile and defy the odds for a deep playoff run. Only one player’s team can win and move on, adding to that player’s season-long success story. 
No matter who wins, it will be a win for Trojan fans simply to see these two players in the playoffs together, playing vital roles on great teams.

Here’s the scene: It’s 4th and 6 on USC’s own 43-yard line. The Trojans are down 14-10 to Oregon State with 2:51 to play in the fourth quarter. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams takes the snap from the shotgun and drops back to pass. 
Pressure comes immediately from the edge and the pocket collapses even quicker, forcing Williams to step up and take off. Williams scrambles up the middle, nearly to the first down marker, where he’s met by two Beaver defenders. 
It looks like he might be stopped short, putting an early end to USC’s undefeated season. Suddenly, out of nowhere comes redshirt senior offensive lineman Brett Neilon. Neilon gets behind Williams first, keeping him up on his feet long enough for his fellow offensive lineman to help propel their quarterback past the line for a crucial first down. 
Five plays later, Jordan Addison’s 21-yard touchdown reception put the Trojans up for good, keeping USC’s Pac-12 Championship hopes alive.
Head Coach Lincoln Riley had some high praise for the game-saving play. 
“[It was] one of my favorite plays that I’ve ever had anywhere,” Riley said in an interview with 247 Sports.“That right there is everything we’ve been preaching. The elite effort and fight gave us a shot there.”
“It was just a pass play, pass block and then I just saw him run,” Neilon said about the play. “And then I saw him get stuck, and I kind of knew, you know, 4th and 6, he’s got to be semi-close. The refs weren’t blowing the whistle, so I assumed he was right there and I just ran and hit him for the extra yardage.”
Neilon, who was a 2020 All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention, has been a member of the Trojan offensive line since 2017. He’s gone through four different offensive line coaches in his time with the team, but that hasn’t changed the way he practices and plays. 
“Coach Henson always preaches run to the ball, so that’s kind of what I did,” he said. 
The team practices heads-up plays like the one Neilon made in the OSU game, but Neilon made sure to point out that plays like that also involve “little instincts.”
As a child, Neilon and his family moved to Tokyo for his dad’s work. He stayed there until eighth grade, when he moved back to the United States. By the time he returned, he was a multi-sport athlete in baseball, basketball, and soccer, but also was proficient in the Japanese martial art known as aikido. He played football in high school, and started on varsity as a sophomore.
Additionally, he considers himself a good dancer and an even better singer. Without hesitation, Neilon said his go-to karaoke song is “Love Story,” by Taylor Swift.
Coming out of Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, California, 247 Sports had Neilon ranked as a four-star recruit, 23rd overall in the state. He committed to USC, the alma mater of both his father and his brother, in February of 2017.
Neilon’s game day ritual goes a bit like this: “If it’s a later game, we do a team stretch later, watch some games, and usually start around two. Right when I get [to the locker room] I get changed, I grab Ritz Sour Cream Bites, and then I actually take a 20-minute meditation on the floor.” 
Why Ritz Sour Cream Bites? Neilon smiled at his superstitious pregame snacking habit.
“I grabbed them the first game, and now every time I have to eat them,” the veteran offensive lineman said. 
Neilon has been a part of both USC’s Pac-12 championship-winning team in 2017 (the year in which he redshirted) and the team which finished with its worst record in nearly two decades. 
“That 2017 team, man, that was a talented team. And even years after that, we had a lot of talent,” Neilon said. 
Although the talent has been there, the lack of recent success has been present as well. With the Lincoln Riley era just beginning, Neilon claims that there have been noticeable changes. 
“I think just the culture, what Lincoln has brought, just bringing us together, just really doing a tremendous job, discipline and all that, and just really feeling like [we’re] a team. That’s why Lincoln is the cream of the crop.”
It’s safe to say that the USC football program has had its fair share of ups and downs in the past few years, but as of right now, the Trojans are making big waves in the world of college football. The Trojans have a 5-0 record, are undefeated in conference play, and are ranked 6th overall in the country. 
Neilon understands the importance of this season. His primary goal? To “just win out.” 
Sophomore guard Jonah Monheim is on the same page as his lineman counterpart, and echoed the words of his offensive coordinator. 
“[Coach Henson] says, ‘winning often dulls hunger’. Winning in general, you look at the history of sports, it can dull. Day-to-day, week-to-week. That can’t be what happens,” Monheim said. “You’ve got to stay hungry. You’ve got to stay relentless. Take it one day at a time.”
Neilon has been through thick and thin during his time as a Trojan. He knows what it’s like to win and to be a champion, but also what it’s like to be at the bottom. Although winning out is a main goal of his, Neilon wants more out of his final season. 
“I’m so thankful I came back and get to play another season,” he said, “[I’m] just enjoying every day and encouraging the guys, having fun, obviously, win each week.”
Neilon’s clutch heads-up play against Oregon State saved the day for the Trojans. Now, as the season continues, the entire team will make a push to the promised land: the College Football Playoffs. Will they finally make it there? It would be unlikely without the strong veteran presence of Brett Neilon.

After beating the Arizona State Sun Devils 42-25 at home last Saturday, the Trojans will look to secure another victory at home against the Washington State Cougars. In last season’s meeting between the two teams, USC beat Washington State 45-14, and entering Saturday’s game, the Trojans have a 63-10-4 all-time record against the Cougars.
The Trojans have taken their last three matchups against the Cougars, averaging 40.7 points per game in the process.
In Saturday’s victory over the Sun Devils, it was a tale of two halves for USC’s defense, as the Trojans gave up 17 points in the first half to Arizona State but surrendered only one touchdown with 6:19 remaining in the game. The Trojans enter Saturday’s game with three of their five victories coming against Pac-12 teams. 
Teams continue to have no answers for the Trojans’ offensive attack as USC is averaging 42.2 points per game on offense, good for No. 1 in the Pac-12 and No. 10 in the nation. USC’s offense has been on a roll all season but will face another tough defense on Saturday; the Cougars are second in the Pac-12 in scoring defense, giving up only 18.2 points per game this season. Head Coach Lincoln Riley spoke Tuesday on the challenges Washington State’s defense presents to USC’s high-powered offense.
“They do a lot of things like our defense does,” Riley said. “They’re aggressive up front and they move enough to cause you problems… They fly around and cause a lot of havoc.”
Washington State’s defense sits only behind Utah in the conference in points per game allowed this season.
A player that will be critical for the Trojans not only against Washington State but also going forward will be redshirt senior offensive lineman Justin Dedich. Riley spoke on Dedich’s status against Washington State after missing Saturday’s game against Arizona State with a leg injury.
“We’ll keep evaluating him throughout the week, we’re trying to be smart,” Riley said. “Obviously we’d love for him to be able to play but then the flip side of it is we have a lot of season left. You gotta be smart with him.”
The USC defense will have to prepare for the unique challenges the Washington State offense presents to them. Sophomore defensive back Calen Bullock spoke on the unique qualities of Washington State’s offensive personnel and, in particular, sophomore quarterback Cameron Ward.
“[He’s] a real good passer,” Bullock said. “He has a real good arm and he’s a talented quarterback. He likes to scramble a lot and throw on the scramble.”
Bullock also spoke about how the Cougars’ offense compares to other units they have faced.
“It’s a really talented offense,” Bullock said. “It’s probably one of the best offenses we’re going to play.”  
The play calling of Washington State’s Offensive Coordinator Eric Morris has been a key component of Washington State’s success on offense. The Cougars are averaging 29.6 points per game in their five games played so far. 
“It’s a good system,” Riley said. “It’s a tough system to stop with the combination of what they run and their quarterback making it go.”
Two units that could ultimately be a deciding factor in the outcome of the game are USC’s offensive line and Washington State’s defensive line. The Cougars are second in the nation in tackles. One player making a big impact for their defensive unit is senior linebacker Daiyan Henley, who leads the Cougars in tackles with 44 on the season. Henley has also recorded four sacks and two forced fumbles this year.
USC will look to match Washington State’s defense with production from their prominent offensive stars. Senior running back and Oregon transfer Travis Dye has averaged 6.8 yards per carry this season and has 422 yards rushing with five touchdowns. Junior wide receiver Jordan Addison is coming off eight catches and 105 yards against Arizona State, and for the season Addison has 442 yards and six touchdowns.
Other wide receivers that will look to continue to make an impact for the Trojans against Washington State are junior Brenden Rice and redshirt freshman Kyron Hudson. Rice is coming off a 72-yard game, his highest of the season and Hudson caught three passes for 46-yards and a touchdown against the Sun Devils.
Addison spoke after practice about Hudson and what he brings to the wide receiver room.
“He comes out here and competes everyday,” Addison said. “It was good to finally see him get his shot. He got his one opportunity and he made the most of it.”
As the Trojans look to stay perfect, beating Washington State will take a team effort. The game is set to kickoff tomorrow, Oct. 8, at 4:30 p.m. at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

It was a brisk night waiting in line at the Echo, but things were starting to heat up inside in anticipation of Topaz Jones performing on Tuesday. While it wasn’t packed to the brim initially, people would trickle in as the night progressed.
The show kicked off at 7 p.m. with a DJ set from DJ VIVALATINA. Her set featured a variety of mash-ups of songs, mixing Kaytranada, Tyler, The Creator, Gunna and many others together to provide a different, refreshing and enjoyable vibe. 
The Echo isn’t the biggest venue in Los Angeles, but that only made the experience with the crowd more intimate. The person furthest from the stage was probably only 20 feet away from the three acts. 
VIVALATINA’s set went on for around an hour, with her saying very little — letting the music do the talking. And it showed as people grooved, danced and nodded their heads to her music selection. 
After signing off, the lights went back on and the audience went back to chatting with whoever they came with while they waited for the 2nd set, Huey Briss. The Long Beach native would arrive slightly late for his set, citing traffic as his reason, which is typical for L.A. at 8 p.m. His DJ did a mini-set — only one song — before Briss came dashing onto the stage.
Comedically, so did his 2-year old daughter, who was running around the stage and needed to be seated before he performed his first song. After his opening song, his daughter was taken backstage and Briss continued rapping, even going a cappella at one point. While many didn’t know the words to Briss’ songs, he brought an energy to his set that was infectious and had the fans chanting along to whatever he wanted them to chant. 
After his set, it went back to a brief intermission until it was time for headliner Topaz Jones to hop onstage and give the performance that the audience came for. He kicked it off with the first song of his 2021 project “Don’t Go Tellin’ Your Momma,” “Mirror,” where he brought out California native Leven Kali who was unannounced for this concert. Both shared their moment and their chemistry was apparent, with both basking in the spotlight. 
This was Jones’ first live performance in four years, but that wasn’t apparent as he delivered quite the spectacle, oozing with confidence. He was racing across the stage, dancing and interacting with the crowd, all with a massive smile on his face from cheek to cheek.
The Montclair native brought passion and fun to the first date of his four-date tour for DGTYM Jones performed an hour-long set in the small yet packed Echo, showcasing his documentary, which accompanied the project and won a Sundance Award, in acts. He showed his discussion with lawyer and activist Keith White, which highlighted social aspects of black culture and life. 
Jones performed many of his songs off of DGTYM, such as “Black Tame,” “Amphetamines” and “Rich,” as well as his 2018 hit track “Tropicana.” Jones was very animated throughout his set as he danced and performed theatrics that accompanied his lyrics, such as pretending to apply eyedrops after rapping “I need to buy some eyedrops” when performing “Sourbelts.”
Jones also performed his verse from his BET cypher which was released the same day.  
Jones went on to finish off the night with a new song which he called a “world premiere,” where he crooned the lyrics of the chorus and then rapped the verses, which is a formula he follows in many of songs. Afterwards, he shared the limelight with his instrumentalists, Cam Griffin on the guitar, Daniel Abraham on the keyboard, and Jayvid Borja on the drums, with each having their moment to shine.
The audience cheered on for an encore as Jones shaked hands with the three aforementioned musicians and nearly walked off before addressing the chants. While Jones said he didn’t have an encore planned for his show, he would perform a verse that wasn’t recorded for his BET cypher. 
Jones left everything out on the Echo’s stage, as he was visibly drenched in sweat and his fans appreciated it. His interaction with the audience, his groovy and high energy songs and performance and his brief intermissions where he talked about life with those in attendance made it highly entertaining and a reason as to why his stock as an artist continues to rise.

The leaves are falling, everyone is drinking pumpkin spice lattes and it’s sweater weather. Ah, it finally feels like fall… just kidding. It’s still 90 degrees in Los Angeles, and I haven’t yet had the opportunity to wear a turtleneck. But that doesn’t mean we Angelenos can’t gaslight ourselves into thinking it’s fall. Since we can’t go apple-picking or jump into a big pile of leaves, we rely on movies to get us into the spooky season vibe. So grab your friends and head out to these Halloween movie screenings happening all throughout the month:
“Carrie” (1976) at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery — Oct. 22
What better way to spend Halloween in L.A. than by watching a movie near a cemetery filled with old dead Hollywood stars! With live music, fun photo booths and food, The Hollywood Forever Cemetery is one of the most popular outdoor screening venues in L.A. In the spirit of the Halloween season, Cinespia will host various Halloween movie screenings at the cemetery, including cult classic “Carrie.” 
From constant anxiety attacks to sleepless nights, we can all agree that high school sometimes felt like a never-ending horror movie. Director Brian de Palma brings Stephen King’s supernatural coming-of-age horror novel to life through his colorful and playful techniques. Constantly bullied and berated by her overly religious mother and cruel students at her school, Carrie (Sissy Spacek), an awkward teenage girl, reaches her breaking point and seeks revenge on everyone using her telekinetic powers. Prom turns into a bloody night of chaos and horror as Carrie unleashes her pent-up anger and leaves no one untouched. As De Palma unfolds the horrors of adolescence, you can’t help but relive your own high school nightmares. 
“Frankenstein” (1931) with Live Orchestra at The Theatre — Oct. 28-Oct. 29
A mad scientist, a horrific monster, and an angry mob. What else could you want from a classic Halloween movie? As the poster-child of Halloween movies, “Frankenstein” represents all that audiences love about monster films. Based on Mary Shelley’s groundbreaking novel, the film follows the tumultuous relationship of Doctor Frankenstein and his menacing yet troubled monster. Unable to gain the love of his creator, Frankenstein’s monster terrorizes the town, who simply view him as a threat. From the chilling Gothic aesthetics to the unforgettable “It’s Alive!” scene, “Frankenstein” continues to captivate audiences more than ninety years later. 
To honor this iconic film, the L.A. Opera will host a special screening with a live orchestra. Despite its impressive cinematography and engaging narrative, the original film lacks a much-needed score, which would enhance the eerie mood of the story. Thus, composer Michael Shirapro will premier his original score live as the film plays simultaneously on the big screen. Pairing this Halloween classic with a live orchestra will truly make this film “alive!
“Hocus Pocus” (1993)  at the El Capitan Theatre — Oct. 7-11
Upon its original theatrical release, “Hocus Pocus” was both a box office and critical failure. However, almost thirty years later, this film has become one of the most watched Halloween movies of all time. The historic El Capitan Theatre, located on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame, will celebrate this Halloween masterpiece with several screenings alongside a display of iconic props from the film, such as the Spell Book and the witches’ brooms. 
 Following the story of the Sanderson Sisters (Bette Milder, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kathy Najimy), a trio of quirky witches who come back from the dead hungry for the souls of children, “Hocus Pocus” captures the essence of the Halloween spirit. With fall foliage all around, a talking black cat and potion-brewing witches, this film feels like a warm cup of apple cider on a chilly autumn day (whatever that feels like). No Halloween season would be complete without a viewing of this fan favorite. With the sequel, “Hocus Pocus 2” (2022), recently released on Disney+, it’s the perfect time to revisit the charming and nostalgic original. 
On your way out of the El Capitan Theatre, feed your devilish desires and treat yourself to an indulgent hot fudge sundae at the Ghirardelli Soda & Chocolate Shop right next door.
“Beetlejuice” (1988) at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures — Oct. 30
As one of the newest landmarks in L.A., the Academy Museum is a great place to visit anytime of the year.  In celebration of Halloween, the Academy Museum will screen a month-long marathon of horror films concluding with the zany classic “Beetlejuice.” 
Tim Burton, the king of Halloween cinema, shares his nightmarish yet childish perspective of the afterlife in his second feature film. When a wealthy dysfunctional family moves into a haunted house, the ghosts of a newlywed couple (Alec Baldwin and Gena Davis) occupying the home must find a way to scare them away in order to reestablish their peace. In comes Betelguese (Michael Keaton), an obnoxious and insensitive ghoul, who promises to help the dead couple reclaim their house through his slimey antics. With hilarious musical numbers and highly saturated gothic visuals, “Beetlejuice” is definitely not your average Halloween movie. Combining exaggerated horror with slapstick comedy, Burton creates a weirdly charming film that leaves you humming “shake, shake Señora” for the whole day.
