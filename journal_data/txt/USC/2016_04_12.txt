Legal clerk and environmental activist Erin Brockovich spoke about her experiences fighting energy companies in court and called for students to take personal action in the environmental movement Tuesday night in Bovard Auditorium. The Undergraduate Student Government Program Board’s Speakers Committee and Environmental Student Assembly partnered to put on the event.
Brockovich, the subject of the 2000 Oscar-nominated movie Erin Brockovich, brought a lawsuit against Pacific Gas & Electric in 1993 over the company’s contamination of drinking water in Hinkley, California. Despite a lack of formal legal training, she scored a victory for the environmental movement when she settled the case for $333 million in 1996, the largest settlement paid in a direct-action lawsuit in U.S. history.
At Tuesday’s event, Brockovich shared her views on environmentalism, focusing on episodes over her past 22 years of work and connecting them to the current Flint water crisis. Starting the night with questions about her film, Brockovich explained that the movie concept began when a friend shared her story with another friend, who had connections in the film industry.
“I didn’t aspire for any of this,” Brockovich said. “[My friend] would ask me stories about my day, and I’d tell her about green water and frogs with two heads. She thought it was pretty odd because I didn’t really have any business going around collecting toxic waste. I often wore stilettos and miniskirts.”
However, once the film deal was confirmed, she spent a year with the writing team to verify the movie’s accuracy.
“It was probably 98 percent accurate,” Brockovich said. “They did a very factual piece, and that was very important to me.”
Brockovich wanted the content of the film to reflect the value that she placed on the environment, and not just the legal process of taking on a large energy company.
“I’ve always had great passion for the environment and people,” Brockovich said. “We live in an environment where we coexist together. It becomes very near and dear to us, just like a member of our own family.”
She told the audience that the environment is fragile, but necessary for everyone.
“We are either going to benefit from it, or we are going to begin to suffer from it,” Brockovich said. “We just don’t think about it until it could be gone.”
Brockovich brought up the fact that the event took place during Earth Month, a month devoted to reflecting on the state of the earth and taking action to help improve it. However, she questioned whether such a month was actually helping tackle environmental issues or whether it simply gave a sense of false support.
“Does it have to be one month out of the year?” Brockovich asked. “It’s a topic of conversation that we should be having every month.”
Brockovich recounted the failure of agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency in saving the environment, a problem that she has witnessed during her career in environmentalism and advocacy.
“We want to believe that our government and these agencies are in place to protect us,” Brockovich said. “I see the disappointment when I become the bearer of the bad news. These agencies have been very absent, especially when it comes to the environment.”
Because of this, she urged the audience to start becoming aware of the environmental issues occurring in their communities and calling for action.
“We have to begin saving ourselves,” Brockovich said. “We’ve been comfortable too long.”
Brockovich then described her new digital project, the Community Health Book, where people can document the adverse effects of environmental issues, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and other personal injuries. She explained that her focus was on helping people, collecting data and using it to create communities, and saw an application in situations such as the Flint water crisis.
“Flint, Michigan is really concerning to me,” Brockovich said. “The lack of transparency is causing issues for everybody. This is a human issue — every single one of us is entitled to the truth and to clean drinking water.”
Having toxic chemicals in drinking water, however, is not exclusive to Flint. According to Brockovich, local governments and agencies over the country put chemicals in water to save money and make a profit.
“We have a safe drinking water act which is supposed to protect us,” Brockovich said. “It’s not. They’d come up with something to save a buck.”
Brockovich explained that her personal background has shaped her values and work. She cited her mother and father as her main inspirations.
“By birthright, I tend to think like an engineer and I’m snoopy like a journalist,” she said. “I have a perspective of people. It’s been drilled into me since I was a little girl.”
Using these stories, Brockovich reflected on the nature of leadership.
“Everything you do in life requires you to have a strong character,” Brockovich said. “Your strength of character comes from you and how you perceive yourself. So you become that leader that you’re actually looking for.”
Brockovich discussed Realization, Assessment and Motivation, a program which she has developed over her past 22 years of work. She encouraged the audience to know who they are, stick to personal choices and be motivated. Ultimately, she believes that everyday people are beginning to take personal responsibility for solving global problems, but that more can be done.
“A social movement is happening,” Brockovich said. “Change is here, and I think it’s really exciting. Superman’s not coming, so tag, you’re it.”
She is truly a treasure. One day we’ll look back at our poisoning of the groundwater and wonder what the heck were we thinking?

At its weekly meeting Tuesday night, the Undergraduate Student Government Senate considered a corrective change to the USG bylaws and hearings to address complaints regarding appointments to positions throughout the organization.
After restructuring and streamlining USG for the next academic year, some officers realized that, in the new organization, they would not receive proper compensation. The Senate considered changing the bylaws to allow an increase in USG members’ stipends. A vote on these changes will take place during the next USG meeting.
Vice President Austin Dunn and Sen. Sabrina Enriquez described modifying the bylaws as a “loophole” to correct the error with compensation.
“This is meant as a Band-Aid because we did a restructure. [In the previous Senate], we didn’t anticipate that we would need a bylaw like this,” Enriquez said.
Other senators expressed concern about setting a poor precedent. Sen. Tyler Matheson asked about the amount of funding that would need to be increased to address stipend errors. Dunn and Enriquez dismissed those concerns.
“The budget is totally different this year than years past,” Dunn said. Dunn also said that budget hearings will be held over the weekend to determine how USG will allocate funding.
A move by Enriquez to limit the bylaw change only to the 2016-2017 school year passed unanimously. Sen. Daniel Newman’s move to vote on the bylaw change at this week’s meeting failed. The Senate will consider the matter again at next week’s meeting.
A large portion of the Senate meeting was spent discussing complaints regarding students who were appointed to Funding Board and other divisions of USG. They received emails from three different USG members who were upset with the appointment process.
“All the complaints have been … that the qualified person was not hired,” Lurie said. “The executive team is talking about how they can handle it and meet with those people and deal with all the complaints.”
Newman accepted the mistakes that were made with the appointments by USG and hopes to amend them for the future.
“I wanted to express my disappointment in the way that this was handled,” Newman said. “I know we can’t do anything now, but I hope that we can all learn from this.”
Some senators, including Lurie, expressed interest in attending the executives’ hearings with those who filed complaints. Dunn and USG Chief of Staff Jenny Di agreed to allow senators to sit in.
Lurie proposed that other USG members be allowed to sit in on the hearings so that senators could have “context” for what a good candidate for the position would be like, but Di said that letting other USG members attend the hearings would put them in an “uncomfortable position.”
“The priority is to address specific people who have specific complaints. … After these preliminary conversations are had, … I’m totally fine with looping in as many people as we need to,” Di said.
Dunn reiterated that although the executive board supported their appointments, they could have been more transparent with their appointments.
“Our executive team firmly and with totality stands behind the decisions that we made, with one exception, and that was the way it was presented to all of you,” Dunn said. “It made it seem like there was something to hide, and there wasn’t necessarily complete and total transparency. And the same way that you can’t take back your vote, we can’t take back the decision we made in that moment.”

USC will award honorary degrees to six candidates for their outstanding contribution to their fields of specialty at the 133rd Commencement on May 13.
The recipients, who were announced on April 4, will be Larry Ellison, founder of the Oracle Corporation as well as this year’s commencement speaker; Alejandro G. Iñárritu, an Academy Award-winning Mexican filmmaker and director of the films The Revenant and Birdman; Jackie Lacey, Los Angeles County District Attorney; Mark Stevens, a managing partner of S-Cubed Capital and a member of the USC Board of Trustees; Mary Stevens co-chair of Sacred Heart Preparatory in Atherton, California; and Selim Zilkha, co-owner of Zilkha Biomass Energy.
Margo K. Apostolos, co-director of the Cedars-Sinai/USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance Medicine Center and an associate professor of dance, is the chair of the honorary degrees committee.
“Each year, the committee tries to elevate the standard of excellence,” Apostolos said. “I think this year the recipients indeed reflect the extraordinary achievements in their respective fields.”
The Office of the Provost manages the process of the honorary degree. Apostolos added that any member of the USC community including faculty, staff, student, alumni or trustee could nominate a candidate.
The potential candidate can have exceptional achievements outside of their academic area too.
“You could have artists, scholars, engineers, business people, but the criteria we look for is that they have extraordinary achievements in their work, and that varies with every profession,” Apostolos said.
Ellison founded the Lawrence Ellison Foundation that supports biomedical research on aging and age-related diseases and disabilities. Iñárritu recently became the first director to win two consecutive Oscars in 65 years. Lacey is the first African-American to be elected since the office’s establishment in 1850. Last year, Mark and Mary Stevens  endowed the USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute. They also established the USC Stevens Center for Innovation in 2004. Zilkha is a member of the Keck Board of Overseers for the Keck School of Medicine of USC and the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute at Keck, which is dedicated to researching Alzheimer’s, has been named in his honor.
The process of naming the honorees goes through several steps. The Honorary Degrees Committee reviews the nominated candidates and selects a group of nominees who are then recommended to President C.L. Max Nikias. Nikias forwards the list of nominees with outstanding distinction to the Academic Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees. The board is entrusted with the responsibility of awarding the honorary degrees. Apostolos said that this year the committee made a greater effort to reach out to students for nominations.
According to Apostolos, there was a significant increase in the student nominations for this academic years. The nomination process is confidential, and the nominee cannot be informed that his or her name was put forward. Those who are actively employed by the University are not eligible for nomination. The nominees for the May 2016 commencement were ranked at the March 2015 meeting after being reviewed throughout the 2014-2015 academic year.
“I do have to say that I made an effort as the chair of the committee this year, to specifically reach out for student nominations,” Apostolos said. “Along with Jacob Laux, administrative assistant, Office of the Provost, I visited the Undergraduate and Graduate Student Government and explained the nomination process to the students, took questions and encouraged them to submit nominations.”
Jereme Barnett-Woods, a graduate student majoring in electrical engineering, lauded the committee’s efforts in selecting candidates from different backgrounds.
“It is great that USC has relations with these honorary degree recipients. Each one of them excels in their field of interest and adds great character to our school,” Barnett-Woods said.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Margo Apostolos was the director of dance at USC Kaufman. Apostolos is the co-director of the Cedars-Sinai/USC Glorya Kaufman Dance Medicine Center and an associate professor of dance. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

The Thematic Option Research Conference took place on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday at the University Club in King Stoops Hall.
Steven Lamy, vice dean for academic programs and professor of international relations, gave the keynote address to introduce the event. He talked about the limitations of the current world due to our present-day globalization crisis.
“We have to be willing to do that when the situation arises,”  Lamy said. “It means to stand up to hate, to stand up to violence.”
Each year since 1998, Penny Von Helmolt, the Thematic Option program director, and Richard Edinger, the student program advisor, have worked together to figure out a theme for the year’s conference. The theme of this year’s conference was “Something Must Be Done.”
“Every year, Rich and I dance in a circle, going, ‘What is the right title for this conference? What does it need to be about?’” Von Helmolt said. “No matter what the topic is, the students find creative ways to write interesting things about it.”
To do this, Von Helmolt and Edinger try to choose a topic that will resonate with students rather than professors.
“We want the students to pursue what they think is important, not what we think is important,” Edinger said.
This year, the idea of doing something to create change jumped out.
“I think a major part of it was trying to capture the sound of the zeitgeist. I think that there is a vibe out there that something must be done,” Edinger said. “We’re seeing this through a lot of movements in the world.”
This year, the majority of the freshman class will be able to vote.
“There are a lot of people who are thinking ‘Where do I belong? Will the person I vote for move the country in the direction that I think it should be?’” Edinger said. “This is the moment where there is the highest amount of energy about this.”
For both conference days, 100 students present their papers to an audience, and Von Helmolt noted how important this segment is to the image of the event.
“This is very much a personal conference about the student performance,” Von Helmolt said. “There will around 300 total people. There are a lot of people who come.”
Edinger further talked about how he feels Thematic Option works to create a diverse community that integrates the deeper relevance of ideas and their implications.
“The writing classes all have a theme, but the panel is mixed from different courses,” Edinger said.
Edinger also talked about the skills students learn, such as communicating with others in a comfortable environment of peers and faculty.
“It is a really great translatable skill to have. Most jobs ask you to talk to other people,” Edinger said.
Students such as Marianna Shakhnazaryan, a freshman majoring in international relations, agreed that Thematic Option has enhanced their academic careers.
“I really feel that I have gotten a chance to hone my writing,” Shakhnazaryan said. “I am not nervous about it because I know that the audience consists of my peers. It’s a really low stress situation. It’s people who really want to support me.”

USC’s Venture Incubation Program teamed up with Startup Equinox to host Pulse, an opportunity to network and learn how to leverage resources to bring budding startups and promising ideas to life in Seeley G. Mudd Hall on Tuesday.
The agenda for the night included a discussion with Michael Jones, the former CEO of MySpace, as well as a networking fair featuring a series of USC startups. The discussion was led by Sanket Chauhan, president of Venture Incubation.
Jones is an internet entrepreneur who specializes in building software and internet businesses. Prior to his position at MySpace, Jones began angel investing in multiple startups such as Tinder, Wealthfront, Klout and Dollar Shave Club. Currently, he serves as the CEO of Science, an incubator in Los Angeles that turns potential into profit under professional guidance.
During the discussion and Q&A, Jones told students about his personal experiences as an entrepreneur. Just like many of the students in attendance, Jones’ passion for bringing new ideas to life began during his college years at the University of Oregon, where he and his friends crafted a niche magazine called Elixir that eventually received national attention. His college experiences, Jones said, shaped not only his early ventures, but also his future career.
“Luckily, my university was flexible enough to allow me to build companies and work while I was going to school,” Jones said. “The university, like [USC], was a very big university. It had a lot of variability in what I focused on, and I just started building businesses.”
Jones also described the importance of networking in college as a way to create lasting relationships that transcend the work environment.
“I teamed up with great people I met at college,” Jones said. “Frankly, a lot of the people I work with today … I actually found in my college setting.”
Jones encouraged students to stay patient and open-minded as they discover their convictions and interests. He praised taking risks, and insisted that college is the best time to fail. Above all, he encouraged students to follow their passions.
“Great entrepreneurs just find a way to do stuff, and they find ways to rally resources, and cut corners, or whatever they need to do to pursue their vision,” Jones said. “I find the best entrepreneurs are just relentless at going after what they want to do, and they’re typically going after a segment that they’re personally connected to.”
The startup fair that followed the discussion included social platforms such as Pack Up + Go, Shelf and Fae App, as well as health and wellness related platforms such as Ignite, O2 Max Fitness, Team Roots and KrafftIT. Fourteen startups were in attendance, according to Milan Goyal, director of operations for Venture Incubation.
“It’s an opportunity for [these startups] to showcase what they’re working on,” Goyal said. “If they’re looking for help they’ll find that, [and] other people will network. It’s a way to bring the community together.”
Venture Incubation is a student-run organization that originated from the Viterbi Student Institute for Innovation, which was founded by Ashish Soni, a professor in the Viterbi School of Engineering. The goal of the organization is to provide college entrepreneurs with greater access to resources, learning opportunities and professional connections in an area of interest that many consider to be “do-it-yourself.”
“The problem with the USC entrepreneurship community is that it’s not consolidated,” Chauhan said. “[This] leads to a problem where a lot of teams are always looking for people to hire or work with … but they aren’t able to find the right talent. But I know that the talent is there, it’s just a matter of connecting those two ends.”

USC baseball players will have to have a quick turnaround after dropping their single game against Pepperdine 3-2 in a mid-week trip to Malibu, before heading to Eugene to take on the Ducks this weekend. With the loss, the Trojans worsened their overall season record to 15-16.
Head coach Dan Hubbs said that the offense seemed to be in a “bit of a lapse,” as players were continuously able to get on base, yet unable to produce the timely hits needed to bring the runners home while they were in scoring positions.
“Offensively we just did not get anything going. We had a couple of opportunities,” Hubbs said. “Whereas they got a big two-out hit with men at second and third, we did not get the two-out hit with bases loaded. If you are going to win in tight games, you are going to have to get that hit.”
The Trojans stranded a total of five runners and were held to just six hits overall.
Hubbs said that freshman pitcher CJ Stubbs improved upon his last two starts, but added that he was disappointed with the breaking ball that Stubbs threw in the third inning which hit freshman batter Matthew Kanfer and later resulted in a run for the Waves. Stubbs finished the contest with an impressive seven strikeouts through four innings, giving up 2 runs off of five hits.
Pepperdine produced the first runs of the contest in the third inning when sophomore outfielder Ben Rodriguez singled to left center field, scoring junior Aaron Barnett and Kanfer to make the score 2-0.
Stubbs would remain in the game for one more inning until allowing two more hits resulting in two Pepperdine base runners in the fourth, prompting Hubbs to resort to his bullpen. Senior pitcher Marc Huberman entered the game then and pitched two dominant scoreless innings, recording two strikeouts without giving up a run.
USC got its first run of the game in the fifth inning, with two outs gone after redshirt second baseman Frankie Rios hit into a 6-4-3 double play scoring freshman first baseman Dillon Paulson who was on third. Previously in the inning, Paulson had been walked and advanced to second base on a wild throw from pitcher Jonathan Pendergast. Junior shortstop Reggie Southall put down a bunt single to advance Paulson to third base.
Paulson had two hits in his two at-bats, and in the seventh inning, he led off with a double to right field. Redshirt junior Turner Clouse came in for Paulson as a pinch runner and advanced to third base from a sacrifice bunt from Southall and scored thanks to a sacrifice pop fly from Rios to tie the ballgame at 2 runs apiece. Rios had the only RBI of the game.
Trouble started to spell for the Trojans early in the bottom seventh inning when newly inserted junior pitcher Jeff Paschke walked the Pepperdine leadoff man — senior Brad Anderson — and the following batter — junior Manny Jefferson — doubled down the left field line. The Waves scored the game winning run when sophomore Chase Lambert hit a hard single to the shortstop and Southall mishandled the ball allowing the run to come in from third base and made the score 3-2 in Pepperdine’s favor.
The error was one of two defensive faults by Southall, proving to be costly down the stretch.
“Overall, we were just kind of vanilla today,” Hubbs said. “There was nothing great. There was nothing awful. We cannot afford to be vanilla right now.”
Paschke gave up two hits and walked two batters in the one and one-third innings that he pitched. He also produced one strikeout, but it wasn’t enough, and he was charged with the loss bringing his record to 2-1.
Up next for the Men of Troy is a three-game weekend series with the Oregon Ducks. The Ducks are 14-12 overall and 4-5 in Pac-12 play. Most recently Oregon took a 2-1 series win over Cal — the top-ranked team in the conference.

The Pac-12 Conference continued their announcement of All-Century teams with men’s and women’s tennis Tuesday. USC landed six men on the All-Century team including the single’s Player of the Century — Steven Johnson. On the women’s side, only one player was named to the team — current volunteer Assistant Coach Barbara Hallquist Degroot.
Johnson played at USC from 2009-2012, a stretch in which the team captured four straight NCAA championships. Johnson also won back-to-back NCAA singles titles in 2011 and 2012. The two championships were aided by a 72-match winning streak that Johnson carried his junior and senior year and through the end of his career as a Trojan.
Johnson also racked up individual accolades as a Trojan. Johnson was named ITA Player of the Year and Pac-12 Player of the Year twice. He also earned Pac-12 Doubles Team of the Year three times as well as being named a seven-time All-American.
Johnson is now ranked No. 32 in the world as a singles player and No. 47 in doubles.
The other players on the men’s side of the All-Century team are Alex Olmedo (1956-58), Rafael Osuna (1961-63), Dennis Ralston (1962-64), Stan Smith (1966-68) and Bob Lutz (1967-69).
Olmedo won both the NCAA singles and doubles championships in 1956 and 1958.
Osuna and Ralston were teammates on the NCAA championship teams of 1962 and 1963 with Osuna winning the NCAA singles title in 1962 before Ralston went on to capture the title in 1963 and 1964. Osuna and Ralston also paired together to win the 1963 doubles championship. Osuna had won the two previous, and Ralston went on to win an additional one.
Lutz and Smith captured back-to-back doubles titles together in 1967 and 1968 with Lutz claiming the singles title in 1967 before Smith took the championship in 1968.
Each of the Trojans named to the All-Century team excluding Johnson have at least one Grand Slam to his name as well as being inducted into the ITA Men’s Collegiate Tennis Hall of Fame.
Degroot was the sole Trojan named to an All-Century team that was dominated by Stanford, who had seven of the 12 players on the team.
Degroot was USC’s first female scholarship athlete and won three team NCAA titles in 1977, 1978 and 1979. She also earned the USTA singles title in 1976 and 1977 and was named a four-time All-American. As a professional, Degroot reached the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open in 1980 as a singles player before returning to USC as a volunteer assistant coach in 2014.

I figured it wouldn’t happen a second time in a row. Two years ago, during another very strong season in 2014, the women’s lacrosse team improved its national reputation as a formidable team, continuing to grow as one of the up-and-coming programs. But the Women of Troy hadn’t broken away as the clear force to be reckoned with, the true best of the west, in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
The Women of Troy dropped three of nine conference games  in 2014, including a heartbreaking overtime thriller at Colorado by a score of 12-11. The Women of Troy followed that up with another frustrating 1-goal loss that weekend at Denver, losing 8-7. Denver was already one of the dominant forces in women’s lacrosse on the West Coast, so it was easier to understand how an upstart USC program wasn’t quite on the Pioneers’ level yet.
The loss to Colorado, though, was an upset in the other direction. Colorado was the kind of team USC had to beat consistently if it wanted to be a threat to win the conference. Not that there are any games to give away in a nine-game conference season, but splitting between Denver and Stanford still leaves open the possibility of finishing on top of the standings. Everybody else, though, including Colorado, are pretty much must-wins.
It’s similar to the football team’s season. There’s usually enough parity and margin for error for ’SC to drop one to either Stanford or Oregon, but win every other game, and finish on top of the standings. It’s arguably more important that the Trojans show up for all of the potential sleepers and avoid a bad upset than it is for the Trojans to be at a different level against the toughest competition.
So that’s what made this year’s trip to the Rockies so important for the women’s lacrosse team. Not only would it feature arguably the Trojans’ toughest conference test all season in Denver, but it also featured the biggest opportunity for an upset. It was so crucial that the Women of Troy brought their best focus into Boulder. Because as the late and great Star Wars voice actor Erik Bauersfeld would say, “It’s a trap.”
Sure enough, the Women of Troy found themselves back in overtime.
Let’s backtrack a bit — up until that point, this had been by far the best season in the program’s history. The Women of Troy are undefeated, they have climbed into the top-10 of the national poll and they looked poised to make a deep run in the NCAA tournament.
The biggest win up before the Colorado trip was a breakout performance against Duke. The Blue Devils, one of the perennial national powers, knocked the Women of Troy out of playoffs the year before and advanced all the way to the national semifinals. But with a big 11-5 win over the Blue Devils, the Women of Troy not only avenged last year’s playoff loss but also set the tone for the rest of this season. The new expectations were that this team would be a legitimate national title contender — this would be the season the Women of Troy take another huge step forward.
Since then, the Women of Troy had done nothing but dominate. They certainly validated the updated national polls that continue to rank them higher and higher. With the exception of a 14-10 victory over Stony Brook, a well-established East Coast program, the Women of Troy won all nine of their next games by at least 9 goals.
In some ways, it was a great sign for the program. They were truly wiping the floor with the MPSF competition. But the team was in need of a challenge. Not only had the team played every game in California, including the Duke matchup, but the Blue Devils were the only opponent really on USC’s level.
So that’s what made the Colorado trip crucial. It was not just the undefeated record of the team that was on the line, or the chance to take command of the MPSF standings and set the team up for an advantageous NCAA tournament run. It was a chance for the team to show its true mental toughness.
It certainly wasn’t a flawless performance. I’m sure players would say that Colorado shouldn’t be the kind of team taking USC to the brink of defeat. But in the face of the team’s first true test, the team answered the call. It showed up and made the big plays when they mattered most, and came away with a hard-earned victory.
The road will continue to get harder. The Women of Troy will still have to hit Stanford and visit another national power in Northwestern this weekend.
But the team made another big step this weekend. This season is no longer about USC hypothetically having a shot at the national title, or having the talent to compete for a national title. This team legitimately could win it all in its fourth-ever season. The Women of Troy seriously have what it takes.

Following their 8-6 campaign last season, the football team will look to improve upon that mark in 2016, but will have to do so against some stiff competition. According to ESPN’s Football Power Index, USC will face the toughest schedule of all FBS teams this coming season, and it is not difficult to see why.
The Trojans open the season with a neutral-site game against defending national champion Alabama, which many project to be the No. 1 team in the country. This matchup between the two blue-blood programs is one that fans haven’t seen since the teams last met in 1985, and represents an enormous opening challenge for head coach Clay Helton’s team.
The non-conference slate is supplemented by home games against Utah State and Notre Dame, both of whom are highly competitive programs in their own right. This trio of matchups represents one of, if not, the toughest non-conference schedules in recent history, with Alabama and Notre Dame expected to compete for a spot in next season’s college football playoff.
USC will also have to maneuver a loaded Pac-12 conference in addition to their non-conference slate. The gauntlet will begin in Palo Alto, which has seen two instant classics between the Trojans and the Cardinal in their last two matchups at Stanford. The other road games include trips to Utah, Arizona, Washington and UCLA. This group will represent a particularly arduous challenge for USC; the Trojans have lost at least one of their last two road matchups against each of these teams. While the Trojans hope to reverse their fortunes on the road, it won’t get any easier in the Coliseum.
USC will face Arizona State, Colorado, Cal and Oregon at home to complete this season’s schedule. In compliance with Pac-12 rules, USC will not play Washington State or Oregon State this season as a part of the rotating bye schedule.
Boasting the most difficult schedule in the country, USC highlights the trend in scheduling among Pac-12 teams. Eleven of the 12 teams rank in the top 50 nationally for strength of schedule — all except Arizona. Considering that 128 teams constitute the FBS, it is a remarkable statistic and highlights the willingness of Pac-12 teams to schedule difficult out-of-conference matchups. Among these marquee games include Texas at Cal, UCLA at Texas A&M and Stanford at Notre Dame. While USC may face the toughest schedule in the conference, the others aren’t far behind.
Despite the difficult schedule USC faces this upcoming season, they are still considered contenders in the Pac-12 South by many analysts and experts. While playing the toughest schedule in the country will certainly challenge USC’s hopes for an undefeated season, it could be beneficial come time for the playoff committee to makes its selections.
In its inaugural seasons, the playoff committee has rewarded teams who faced grueling schedules and the precedent implies that a loss would not devastate USC’s chances. While any dedicated USC fan knows to temper their preseason expectations, the 2016 squad offers a lot to be excited about as they take on the most difficult schedule in the nation.

Junior international relations major Anoop Chaganty released a music video to his satirical rap, “It’s Not Rape If I’m In A Fraternity” Tuesday as part of Sexual Assault Awareness month. Chaganty worked on this video with a group of filmmakers from the School of Cinematic Arts to spread awareness about sexual assault on college campuses from the perspective of a fraternity brother.
Chaganty first thought of the title for the song when he was studying abroad in India in January 2015, and thereafter developed the idea for the song. It wasn’t until September that Chaganty began the artistic process. He spent some time reading multiple books about sexual assault. Once he finished familiarizing himself with the issue, he began to work on the song. In only two days, Chaganty wrote the lyrics and produced the music from scratch.
“I was always waiting to release [the song] in April because if there was ever a time for this idea to be accepted, it would be during Sexual Assault Awareness Month” Chaganty said.
Chaganty then appointed his friend, Sean Wang, a senior majoring in film and television production, to direct the music video. After completing their pre-production logistics and assembling a group of actors, the video was shot in two days during spring break.
The video begins with a trigger warning for young viewers or victims of abuse and sexual assault. Following this warning is a collection of short clips showing sexual assault covered in the media, in sexual allegation trials, and at universities. To give context to the rap, a blurred image of a fraternity brother in a white toga screams “We will not go quietly into the night! Do what you will! And f-ck who you must!”
A dark laugh follows the speech, setting the tone for the dark satire Chaganty’s rap embodies. As the rap begins, moving shots of the Row on a Saturday night introduce the viewer to the areas where multiple incidents of sexual assault have occured. Chaganty faces the camera head-on as he walks down the row, reciting his intense rap. His walk down the Row is marked by the presence of intoxicated party-goers and his careless colliding with passersby.
After he reaches the end of the row, Chaganty appears in a new setting, holding a flare to light up the dark and eerie cave he’s standing in. The last lyric of the song, “I f-cked that b-tch and got away with it,” is accompanied by two fraternity brothers dressed in white togas making grotesque expressions. The barbarous archetype of the caveman drives the narrative of the modern day male’s response to sexual “conquests” of females. The video ends with Chaganty solemnly staring directly into the camera, making the statement that sexual assault is not an issue to be taken lightly.
Chaganty smartly uses hip-hop as a means to communicate about sexual assault, to counter the usually misogynistic approach rappers take.
“This song can open the door to conversations about sexual assault … Misogyny and hip-hop go together. No one raps about feminism, you know? This demographic could use some exposure to a topic like this,” Chaganty said.
Although the general awareness of sexual assault is increasing, the problem still remains prevalent on college campuses. Chaganty’s rap challenges the current system that perpetuates these assaults.
“Sexual assault has been going on for as long as men and women have existed, but within college campuses it’s existed for years before I was born … So what can I do? Am I going to change the system? No, that’s not going to happen,” Chaganty said. “But at least in a hip hop song, a message that’s never been in this format could get the ball rolling. I don’t think this song is going to start a revolution or end greek fraternities, but I think that it’s a good starting point.”
Chaganty emphasizes how he’s not attacking the individual, rather the institution, and how he hopes that he’ll be able to attend a fraternity party to observe the scene.
“I’m not saying greek life is bad, there’s just a lot of bad things that come from greek life,” Chaganty said. “It’s a groupthink mentality, and any time that you have something like that, it leads the way for a few bad eggs to ruin the whole batch … Hopefully after releasing this song, I’ll still be able to go to a frat party, just to examine. I’d like to be a fly on the wall and witness what’s going on really.”

When I first started writing this column, one of my friends asked me if I really had enough content to fill 14 weeks of stories. He looked at me skeptically, I think secretly hoping I would say no so he could continue to not think of me as a slut. He’s square like that, and I tend to overstate my sexual history when I sense my conversational partner is more conservative than I am.
In response, I laughed and said of course I did. He looked unsurprised. But he doesn’t read my column. He doesn’t know what it’s about. He doesn’t realize that to me, romance can be anything. He’s a hopeless romantic and a serial monogamist. He can’t imagine anything romantically meaningful blossoming outside of that narrow lens. Or at least, that’s what I gather from knowing him.
I used to like him, on and off. We’ve been friends for a long time, and in a way, that’s both repulsive and alluring to me. He reminds me of my first boyfriend, which is a pretty clear indicator that we’d be horrible together. But my attraction was never about being together; it never is. I begin every romance thinking about the end, because I can only really enjoy something if it’s ephemeral. Some might say it’s a strange and depressing way to look at things, but in defense of my philosophy I ask you this: Why are the last few weeks of school always the most fun? Because you know it’s ending.
Needless to say, this kind of mindset is the furthest thing from compatible with someone who only sees romantic value in something he thinks could last forever. I suppose that’s why he refused to have a platonic slumber party movie marathon after I drunkenly pitched the idea to him at Spudnuts. He said he had to be up early, and I laughed and told him it was OK — I knew he’d never say yes anyway. Then he sighed and said it was really because he couldn’t promise it would stay platonic, and it wasn’t the right time, not now. If you’d have asked me sober, I would agree completely.
I want to be clear — I don’t think there’s anything wrong with idealized romance or monogamy. I haven’t exactly been successful with casual flings or open relationships myself. But it seems limiting to me to assume that monogamy is the only condition that can be romantically meaningful. For me especially — I’ve had just as impactful of encounters in a two-night stand as in an eight-month relationship. Hell, I see romance in my relationship with the sports I used to play, in my relationship with myself.
Conversely, I’ve seen would-be romantic scenarios as a minor expansion on friendship. For example, the last guy I dated I liked more as a friend than a lover. That’s not a new dynamic for me — a majority of the people I’ve hooked up with register more on the friend scale. And somehow with all of these people, sex has only made me feel like closer friends rather than lovers.
My mom tells me I should be with more people I feel passionately about, people that I don’t just feel comfortable with. I’ve had much healthier bonds with people I thought of as friends, relationships where I can enjoy myself and other people instead of just the one focal other. But then again, I should probably take her advice with a grain of salt anyway. She also tells me I should date my very square, hopelessly romantic friend.
I’m starting to think that love, in the quintessential “first comes love, then comes marriage, then comes baby in a baby carriage” sense, is unconscionably overrated. I’m happiest loving myself, my friends and random other things: grass lit at golden hour, a really hot Pop-Tart, a surprisingly good conversation. There’s meaning in all of that — the meaning I give it that is — and it can move me just as much as interpersonal romance in a much healthier way. So no, Mom, I don’t think I should date more passionately — not right now at least. There’s too much else out there to love to focus it all on one person. And yes, friend, I most certainly do have enough for 14 weeks. All that and more. For me, love is an endless subject matter.

Actor James Franco grapples with issues of drugs and child abuse in his latest film The Adderall Diaries, which will be released on Friday. The film is an adaptation of the crime-thriller memoir by author Stephen Elliott, and is adapted and directed by Pamela Romanowsky. Its cast features an accomplished lineup including  Franco, Ed Harris, Amber Heard, Christian Slater and Wilmer Valderrama. The Adderall Diaries premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival last year, and was distributed through exclusive digital release to DirecTV customers in March.
Franco takes the lead role as Stephen Elliott, who is creating a book about his wild and hedonistic youth during which he struggled with drugs and abuse from his father. His character is in the midst of a successful book deal and romantic encounters with Lana Edmond (Heard) when his father, Neil (Harris) reappears in his life to challenge the authenticity of the stories told by Elliott. Meanwhile, Elliott is following a court case involving the disappearance of a mother, and is often moved by the proceeding, envisioning or relating aspects of it to his past. While some speculate that the mother ran away, many others suggested it was murder and point the finger of blame to the father (Slater), who Elliott relates to his own father.
The story progresses with developments in Elliott’s experimentation with Adderall, which causes his own form of writer’s block that creates more obstacles in the other facets of his life. Along with the re-emergence of his father into his life, Elliott struggles to make sense of his past and attempts to gain closure from  his dark days as a teen where his drug-fueled escapades would often result in damaging his estranged father’s property, leading to more abuse.
Franco and Harris have the best chemistry in the film as the estranged father and son, who argue over the past and each other’s motives. Their arguments often sweep into high intensity routs, yet their portrayal is always genuine and emotion is congruent with the context of the fight. Common themes between the two are the notions of being “editors” of the past, especially when debating Elliott’s writings, and competing statements over who was the “victim” of their relationship.
Heard and Franco’s character chemistry, on the other hand, does not flow nearly as well. For a substantial part of the film, their relationship is based off of the discomfort caused by Elliott’s arousal for abuse and their own romance falling out of the honeymoon stage.
Although the film ends on a higher note, The Adderall Diaries is a melancholy story that makes Elliott into a Kurt Cobain-esque figure who never truly disproves that humans are naturally bad from his perspective. Perhaps what Elliott realizes at the end, where his character has a greater epiphany, is to start with one’s self as the change in the world, and soon see the change in how one sees others.

With the end of April fast approaching, college students are starting to stress about finals while also getting amped up for one of the biggest music festivals in the country. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival spans over a two-weekend period starting this Friday, featuring artists such as Ellie Goulding, Disclosure and Calvin Harris. With such outstanding performances anticipated, festival goers will dress to stand out in bold patterns, billowy silhouettes and bohemian-inspired accessories.
Fashion idols and supermodel friends Kendall Jenner and Hailey Baldwin made appearances at the festival last year, with their looks setting new goals for this upcoming weekend. Baldwin was playful with her paisley print crop top, while Jenner sported a backwards baseball cap to unleash her inner tomboy. With stark contrasts between outfits, Coachella shines its spotlight on those expressing their individual characteristics through widely held and distinctive fashion trends.
Individualization in the Coachella fashion realm seems far out of reach, but with H&M’s special collection dedicated to the festival, featuring Baldwin as one of the main models, festival goers have access to all of the accessories and apparel necessary to develop their own aesthetic. Nothing makes a statement better than statement accessories: chunky necklaces, chokers, body chains, flower crowns, wide brimmed hats and aviator sunglasses. Located in Indio, California, the annual music festival will most likely be swept under a heat wave, and patrons will look for stylish and sharp ways to cool off.
But don’t limit accessories as the only component capable of cooling off — let the whole outfit speak for itself. Distressed jeans have already been integrated as a college fashion favorite, but they are now serving a more practical purpose in the desert. As denim exudes earthy hues of blue, rose colored textiles and tan suede textures encourage a natural color palette to blend in with the environment.
While modeling a natural palette, festival wear also features natural shapes for the ultimate comfortable and chic look. Rompers, blouses, muscle tanks and flared jeans from stores like Free People and Urban Outfitters share flowy outlines that not only feel free, but stick to the urban style students from big cities like Los Angeles are accustomed to.
Street style is claiming its power in every setting, including the desert. Where gladiator sandals and heeled boots once reigned, Adidas, Vans and Converse sneakers have taken over as the new go-to concert shoes. With rowdy crowds preparing for rappers like G-Eazy and Rae Sremmund to take over the microphone, feet protection plays a major role in concert wear while sporting the latest brands to enhance the overall fashion and music experience.
As festival wear continues to pay homage to 1970s fashion with bell bottom jeans and fringe vests, Coachella applauds today’s style interspersed with individual twists. From diverse prints to personal trinkets worn as necklaces and bracelets, festival wear unites music fanatics with an appreciation for the arts and a tribute to their own tastes in fashion.

The Smoke-Free Campus Coalition, an on-campus, student-run organization that has advocated for the ban of tobacco use on campus, has recently been pushing the campuswide ban of both cigarettes and smokeless tobacco use on campus. Late last month, the Undergraduate Student Government Senate unanimously passed a resolution calling for a smoke-free campus, and the Graduate Student Government Senate will vote on it during their last senate meeting next Monday. The resolution has good intentions — it hopes to reduce the use of tobacco by making campus a smoke-free environment and to create an overall healthier lifestyle for the Trojan community. However, many of these things won’t result from a ban. Ultimately, a ban would be bad for USC.
Such a resolution ignores personal freedom. Students, faculty, staff and guests should be free to smoke if they choose to do so. Supporters of the ban contend that secondhand smoke from tobacco products can harm others, but the University Park Campus already has designated smoking areas. There certainly needs to be better enforcement of these designated areas. People seem to smoke all over campus without any issue, and many people may not even know that there are designated areas. There should be a push to make it well known that there are designated areas and have them enforced by students or staff by simply letting smokers know. Having designated smoking areas is fair. People that don’t want to be exposed to secondhand smoke can make sure they avoid these spots, and people who choose to smoke will still be able to.
One part of this resolution that doesn’t have any ground to stand on is the ban on smokeless tobacco products, products like chewing tobacco. Chewing tobacco doesn’t cause harm to anyone other than the person choosing to use it. It’s completely a personal choice.
This ban also doesn’t consider international students and how their lifestyles might be affected by it. Tobacco use is a cultural norm in different countries. Many international students come from countries where tobacco use is normal and widely practiced, and banning it wouldn’t be fair to these students. It’s also a raw deal for the USC staff that use these products. The employees that serve the Trojan community work hard, and many of them use these products on their breaks to relax during a hard day of work. It’s not right to take that away.
To be clear, tobacco use is bad, and it should absolutely be discouraged. Tobacco has ended lives and brought devastation to many individuals. However, this doesn’t mean student government or the USC administration should ban it. Instead, they can invest more in anti-tobacco campaigns and education programs that may help reduce use.
Ultimately, the decision to use tobacco is a personal choice. Trojans should have the freedom to use tobacco products on campus. Now it’s up to the GSG Senate to send a message to the administration by voting it down.
USC shouldn’t become a Big Brother campus.  Personal freedoms on campus is a priority.  If someone wants to smoke, they already know the consequences.  They don’t need some busybody to tell them  what to do or not to dol
Are you serious? “employees that serve the Trojan community work hard, and many of them use these products on their breaks to relax during a hard day of work. It’s not right to take that away” Well, a lot of people work hard and then use drugs to “relax”, is it not right to take that away either? On no grounds you can justify allowing smoking in public places. The recent Srpingfest event that happened on campus was a nightmare for non-smokers! This article is preposterous! A smoke free campus would be ideal or at least designated smoking areas if nothing!
Sociology assignment:  Write a 3-pp. essay, describing your positions on 1) a ban on campus smoking; and 2) the imposition of “safe space” forbidding real or imagined “microaggressions” and “triggers.”
The smoking ban is unnecessary. Keep the designated smoking areas.

Performance-based funding of public colleges is a common practice in the United States. About 30 states make funding for public colleges contingent, at least to some extent, on the individual school’s performance. Defined by laws, these programs are rooted in the belief that market incentives are the primary motivators for individuals and institutions. While this may be true, the programs that are currently in place overlook that schools can, and often do, change their requirements and grading structures to appear as if they perform better than they actually do to secure more funding. Short-term degree programs that foster higher graduation rates and grade inflation are two of the most common measures taken by colleges with such funding systems. These countermeasures against objective reporting of statistics stand in the way of clear evaluation of public colleges, and until they are done away with, performance-based funding will not succeed in ensuring better school performance.
Performance-based funding initiatives assume that higher scores should be rewarded more than lower scores. Though such a solution to sub-par college completion rates should work in theory, in practice, there are too many workarounds that colleges can take advantage of to get more than their fair share.
According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, in the state of Washington, “the only real change has been a significant increase in the number of short-term certificates issued by community colleges,” degrees that are apparently intended to boost degree-completion rates. This problem is not constrained to Washington alone. All colleges in favor of short-term degrees, which take a year or less to complete and are not as marketable as an associate degree, are arguably guilty of skewing their numbers. This is not to say that a short-term degree is without value, only that it is not indicative of academic rigor equal to that of a bachelor’s or associate degree. As such, if performance-based incentives are to continue, they should take the level of academic rigor into account when parceling out funding. Doing so would likely reduce the accidental incentive to push students toward quicker, less effective and less marketable degrees.
An additional problem, according to an article by Inside Higher Ed, is the decision of some schools in performance-based funding systems to inflate grades so as to artificially minimize failing rates in classes. Incidents of alleged grade inflation are not constrained to schools in performance-based funding systems, but grade inflation takes on an especially significant role in such systems. It makes it appear as if students are performing much better than they actually are, and so it benefits the school’s budget at the expense of potentially weakening the institution’s reputation and the strength of its degree. However, when presented with a choice between reduced funding and pushing a few students through who would otherwise drop out, it is unsurprising that many schools decide to adopt the latter stance in order to preserve their already-strained financial resources.
Finally, there is the fear that such a system of funding benefits well-to-do students at the expense of first-generation and low-income college students. The Chronicle of Higher Education published an article explaining the position that colleges may take with respect to accepting significant numbers of these students: “There are concerns that too many students are going to college, and that states are using their scarce resources on students with a low likelihood of success.” In short, it would be more cost-efficient if schools took more students that are well-off, since these students are generally more likely to perform well and complete their degrees. Thus, students that are assumed to be potential liabilities, like first-generation students, low-income students and low-performing students, may be crowded out in the interest of securing more funding in a performance-based system.
Performance-based funding measures are not bad in and of themselves. In fact, all other things held equal, they make a great deal of sense. However, it is evident that their implementation is currently lacking adequate safeguards against abuse. Institutions of higher learning have many opportunities to unfairly tip the scales in their favor, and until those avenues are blocked by legislation and monitoring, performance-based funding may actually interfere with the goals of higher education — the dissemination of knowledge across society and providing ample preparation for careers. Some states, like Indiana, have performance-based funding systems, but limit their funding to as low as 5 percent of the total education budget. Others, like Ohio, have half of their education funding based on performance.
It is not completely clear whether or not performance-based measures are more effective at driving better results in higher education in practice. What is clear, however, is that if the programs are to succeed in their objectives, they need to be appropriately administered in order to ensure that students enjoy better education and preparation rather than being sold short for institutional financial gain.
