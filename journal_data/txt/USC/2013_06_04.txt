The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety Daily Incident Log between Monday, June 3, and Tuesday, June 4. 
Crimes against property
at 11:58 p.m. on June 3, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect prowling in the bike racks at University Gateway Apartments and detained him for investigation. The officers found the suspect in possession of burglary tools and surveillance camera footage provided by a security guard showed him in the racks where a cut bike lock was found. The suspect was then arrested and transported to 77th Street Station for booking.
At 9:11 p.m. on June 3, DPS officers responded to a report of an unknown subject having tipped over a University electric cart possibly while joyriding inside Parking Structure D. The officers were able to push the cart back onto its wheels and they observed no damage. The cart was then parked in a stall until its parking spot could be determined.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 12:58 a.m. on June 4, DPS officers responded to a report of a non-USC male behaving suspiciously near Adams Boulevard and Severance Street and when they contacted him, they observed that he was bleeding from lacerations to his head. The male said he had been drinking and the cuts were sustained when he fell. A Los Angeles Fire Department Rapid Assistance was called. The RA Unit treated the male and transported him to California Hospital.

The California Science Center Board of Directors could vote today on the latest terms of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum lease agreement with USC.
Trouble in the arena · USC hopes to lease the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, but faces opposition from those who believe the switch of parking spots surrounding the Coliseum to the school will be debilitating. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
If approved by the Board, the agreement would give USC full managing rights at the state historical landmark and guarantee the University 70 percent of the parking spaces in the Science Center’s deck on 25 event days per year (33 if the NFL uses the stadium temporarily). It would also extend USC’s lease from 2054, the expiration date agreed upon in a December 2012 plan, to 2111 — a 98-year deal.
Opponents of the deal spoke out at public forums this week, saying that the loss of parking would take both revenue and visitors away from the California African American Museum, the California Science Center and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.
“It goes too far,” said Charmaine Jefferson, CAAM’s executive director. The state cut the museum’s budget in half 10 years ago, and since, CAAM has relied heavily on revenues from the Exposition Park parking lot, which is owned by the state. She said the state currency divides the parking lot revenue among the museums, and that giving USC the excess revenue is “wrong.”
Under this lease, USC will pay $10 — the standard weekday rate — for each parking spot on each day it controls the lot. But on special event days, the state has been able to charge as much as $16 for those spaces. And if USC raises prices, it can keep the profits, she said.
The leaders of all three Exposition Park museums share Jefferson’s concern that the lease agreement is lopsided in USC’s favor.
“[This deal] doesn’t adequately ensure the cultural integrity of Exposition Park,” said Kimberly Freeman, a CAAM board member. It requires all Exposition Park entities to schedule “special events” — those attended by more than 3,000 people — 24 months in advance, which is unreasonable for a small institution like CAAM, Freeman said. She added that CAAM projects a $31 million shortfall over 50 years because of lost parking revenue.
“These are free museums and they will be clearly damaged from the loss of parking revenue and the loss of parking itself,” added Science Center Trustee Marvin Holen.
Bobbie Jean Anderson, a Vermont Knolls resident, asked the Board to reject the deal and take more time to negotiate. As it stands, the deal would “surrender some of our most treasured landmarks for next to nothing,” she said.
Further, the terms of the deal were published May 20, just 10 days before the first public hearing. Holen said community members hardly had enough time to review it and make judgments, and a Science Center Board vote today would be premature, Holen said. He has threatened to seek an injunction against the deal.
“Secrecy … has been endemic in this entire process,” he said at the hearing.
Generally, however, stakeholders agree that USC is best equipped to manage and repair the Coliseum, which needs $70 million to $100 million in renovations.
Three current USC students, all alumni of the Neighborhood Academic Initiative, a seven-year pre-college enrichment program that rewards the neighborhood’s most successful students with full scholarships to USC, joined  current NAI students to defend USC’s record of acting in the neighborhood’s best interest.
“We all want USC to manage the Coliseum. They will do this superbly,” Jefferson said. But she doesn’t think the deal is satisfactory yet. “I don’t think they’ll approve this on Wednesday.”
State Sen. Curren Price, who will represent City Council’s ninth district, which includes the Coliseum, beginning in July, called the deal a “clear violation” of the board’s legal obligation to protect its and CAAM’s interests. State Sen. Kevin deLeon said he will ask the legislature to overturn the lease if approved. State Sens. Richard Polanco and Rod Wright have also voiced their dissatisfaction.

On Thursday, the California State Assembly passed a bill that will raise the minimum wage, if approved by the California state senate.
Assemblyman Luis Alejo (D-Watsonville) proposed the bill, which will raise the minimum hourly wage from $8 to $8.25 in the next year and to $9.25 by the year 2016.
This bill would let “our families provide for their children, pay their bills and give them dignity and respect,” Alejo said, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Those against the bill argued that those who held minimum wage positions were often young adults or those using the job as a transition to a better one.
Peter Nordahl-Hansen, a rising senior majoring in critical studies and a student worker at the School of Cinematic Arts, thinks that the raise should only benefit those in need.
“I think in a fair and perfect system, the raise of the minimum wage should apply to everyone within its jurisdiction, regardless if you are a student or full-time worker,” Nordahl-Hansen said.
Most Republicans oppose to the bill and many business leaders feel that raising the minimum wage would force them to cut jobs.
Nicholas Orchanian, a rising junior majoring in chemistry, thinks the government already has too much control over the people’s everyday lives.
“Though their intentions are certainly for the best, any government interference in business could have drastic consequences, particularly in our current, unstable economy,” Orchanian said.
Alejo said he believes that the rising costs of living in the state make it difficult to keep the current wage rate.
“The last time the minimum wage was increased in California, gas was at $3.25 a gallon,” Alejo said, according to CBS Los Angeles. “I don’t know about you, but I haven’t seen gas prices at that level for a very long time.”
Jake Curry, a class of ’13 alumnus who majored in health promotion and disease prevention, said increasing of the minimum wage could have a negative effect on the cost of living.
“I guess the question is: Will the increase in minimum wage cause an increase in consumer consumption?” Curry said. “Because if not, we may be getting ourselves into trouble by increasing it.”
The state senate must now vote on the measure.

Roski will step down after five years as chair.
“For over a decade, USC has benefitted enormously from John Mork’s boundless energy and passion for our academic mission,” President C. L. Max Nikias told USC News.
Mork, a B.S. ’70 and M.S. ’12 alumnus, and his wife Julie Mork donated $110 million to USC in 2010 to provide scholarships to low-income students at the school. The Mork Family scholarships pay full tuition plus $5,000 in living expenses for 100 students each year.
In 2005, the couple donated $15 million to the Viterbi School of Engineering, naming the Mork Family Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science.
John Mork is the founder and CEO of Energy Corporation of America, based in Denver, Colo. His son Kyle Mork took graduate classes at Viterbi while his daughter Alison Mork ’05 and M.A. ’10 majored in Business Administration and received a Masters of Arts in Teaching from the USC Rossier School of Education.

Only God Forgives, the second collaboration between director Nicolas Winding Refn and actor Ryan Gosling, fails to live up to the brilliance and intensity of Drive, their first movie together. The film premiered at Cannes to tepid reviews and is set for a July 19 release in the U.S.
Father, forgive me · Julian (Ryan Gosling) teams up with his mother, Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas) to enact revenge in the slums of Bangkok. This marks the actor’s second collaboration with director Nicolas Winding Refn. – Courtesy of Wild Bunch
The film follows international drug lord Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas), who travels to Bangkok to claim the body of her youngest son when he is found dead days after murdering a young prostitute. She calls on her other estranged son, Julian (Gosling), to support her in her quest for revenge, even as a redemptive local policeman (Vithaya Pansringarm) aims to wipe them both out in an effort to cleanse the city’s underbelly of crime.
Refn certainly can’t be faulted for his colorful style and cinematography, which remain exquisite. Just as he did with Los Angeles in Drive, Refn lovingly instills the city of Bangkok with his trademark neon colors, managing to carefully tread the line between visual poetry and tawdriness. The seediness and eccentricity of the location shooting lend a twisted, almost mythical aura to the images, aided by the prominence of Buddhist motifs and statues.
Though faster paced than the measured rhythm of Drive, Only God Forgives still plays with time and deliberately staggered shots within a framework of explosions of color — think Wong Kar-Wai slowed down so as to attempt cinematic philosophical contemplation. Each of Refn’s shots is beautiful, even if at times this seems to restrict the image’s spontaneity and limit the shock inherent in the film’s outbursts of violence.
Nevertheless, the lack of a driving force behind the characters and the flimsy plot will ultimately relegate the film to DVD back catalogs. The lack of contextualization renders the violence gratuitous -— it even makes Quentin Tarantino look tame — while the minimal attention paid to characterization leaves the viewer wondering whether this is meant as deliberate and unsuccessful artistic ambiguity or if it simply betrays the writer-director’s lack of investment.
While the relationship between Crystal and Julian sets up several potentially perverse and interesting narrative strands, the film settles instead for negligible plot development and a reliance on its own aesthetics that borders on pretentious. Rather than complement the stunning cinematography with a revenge quest of equal power, Refn chooses to rely entirely on his visual mastery and experimentation, sidestepping his own insubstantial narrative in favor of self-determined artistic excess.
Thomas’ performance as the no-nonsense, tacky yet refined mother acts as one of the film’s few saving graces; she delivers the most compelling lines in the sparse script with panache and charisma. Straddling the line between a drug-infused ‘hoochie mama’ and a caring mother, she approaches the performance with obvious enjoyment and delights in a character so different from her previous roles.
By contrast, Gosling seems to have abandoned the strength and quiet concentration that defined his performance in Drive in favor of an inaccessible stance so far removed from the spectator that even Clint Eastwood would surely protest. Even his good looks and his suave aura can’t save him here; at times his non-acting borders on offensiveness before a savvy film audience, and even more so for fans of Refn’s previous work.
Only God Forgives is so similar to Drive it can’t help but invite comparison, and falls short of its inspiring predecessor in every aspect. Where Drive’s sparse dialogue generates intensity and adds ambiguity to the characters, Only God Forgives creates overly composed silences that frustrate rather than narrate, stressing the extreme stylization of the film in a completely negative way.
Entire scenes are staged as semi-static tableaus, through a privileging of stillness in the acting and blocking that comes off as staid and redundant rather than mythical or sacred. Similarly, while the soundtrack of Drive offers an emotional extension of the film’s inner psyche, in Only God Forgives the incessant quirky Thai music feels overtly out of place in a move that countless previous directors have done better than Refn; it seems to follow a trend rather than add its own flavor. The ’80s synth that spoke volumes in Refn’s previous film now begs to be silenced, failing to capture character dynamics, atmosphere or anything of real value beyond repetitive noise.
While Drive stakes its claim as the ideal marriage of style and substance, Only God Forgives sacrifices the latter in favor of the former, ignoring the possibilities that could have propelled this semi-coherent revenge story to a more compelling level. While Only God Forgives’ style is glorious, the heart and general makeup of its story are so vapid that the spectator is challenged to care about the outcome of the film or of any of the characters, making the movie an unfortunate disappointment among this year’s summer releases.

When USC alumna Mary Kate Wiles started her acting career, she never thought that she would find fame on the smaller silver screen. But thanks to a little luck and her sense of spontaneity and creativity, Wiles has become an Internet star. The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, a YouTube series in which Wiles plays Lydia Bennet, has already accrued more than 30 million views, creating a wide and loyal fanbase.
Rising star · In addition to playing Lydia Bennet in The Lizzie Bennet Diaries on YouTube, Wiles (center), who graduated from USC with a Bachelor’s in English and theatre, currently stars as Zelda Waring in a different web series, Squaresville and has been featured in The Newest Pledge. – Courtesy of Mary Kate Wiles
Wiles’ love of storytelling inspired her to go into acting.
“It’s so silly, but when I saw Lord of the Rings for the first time I was like, I wanna do that,” said Wiles. “That’s what I want to do, I want to go on adventures and tell stories.”
Since then, she’s been telling stories through several hit web series such as Squaresville and School of Thrones, as well as some indie movies such as Dark Woods, and has even starred as the iconic Anne Shirley in Jessica Kubzansky’s stage production of Anne of Green Gables.
Wiles starred in a number of productions while working on her Bachelor of Arts in theatre and English at USC.
“I kind of always knew that I wanted to be out here,” Wiles said. “The moment I stepped off the plane, I was just like ‘everything is perfect’ and I’ve loved it ever since.”
Even though Wiles said she never won any of the lead parts, she continued to work on her craft and in her last year landed the role of Jeanne in Brigadoon, her father’s favorite musical.
Last year, Wiles was cast in The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, which went viral online. An adaptation of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, LBD is set in 21st-century California and features a modern cast of characters in Lizzie Bennet’s life shown through her web videos and Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr posts.
Though she credits most of the show’s success to the LBD’s writers for creating the character of modern Lydia, it is undeniable that Wiles herself has put her own stamp on the role, bringing a lovable yet manic energy to Lydia Bennet, Lizzie’s party-animal sister. At first she reminds us of everyone’s annoying younger sibling, but gradually develops into a complex heroine with stories of her own.
“My Lydia is not the Lydia of the book,” Wiles said. “Her story was a different story.”
Though Wiles views herself as a storyteller, she said she doesn’t have a favorite form.
“I don’t think there is one … Some stories are better told as a movie, or as a series, or as a book or by word of mouth,” Wiles said. “As far as writing goes, an essay style is what I like better … I’m glad that I have that knowledge and that I studied that, just because knowing more about stories, and what makes a good story and how to craft a story, makes you a better storyteller.”
Even though virtual fame is a new, even strange concept, Wiles said she has enjoyed being in the YouTube limelight nonetheless.
“It’s a cool community to be a part of, because everybody is trying to make their success happen and not waiting around for it to come,” said Wiles. “I loved the transmedia aspect of Lizzie Bennet. It meant so much to me as an actor, going through the story as a character, seeing the characters tweeting at each other.”
Despite tens of millions of YouTube views, Wiles realizes that fame of this level is fairly modest.
On YouTube fame, she said, “I want to be like Jennifer Lawrence … but is it going to happen?” Wiles added that she looks up immensely to Cate Blanchett. Like these iconic actresses, she is aware that she’s now a role model for many younger girls.
“It’s really, really strange, when people tell me that,” she said. “It’s also a big responsibility and it has affected how I present myself on social media.”
Wiles would love to do television, but is content to take any opportunity presented to her.
“I am not satisfied by not working,” Wiles said. “Every day I’ve gotten up and tried to figure out how I can be doing what I want to do.”

Australian-born singer-songwriter Lenka Kripac — better known as Lenka — has produced yet another dynamic album: Shadows. Delivering a rich production of soothing melodies paired with her honeyed voice, Shadows will entrance listeners with its lullaby-like quality.
Mother lullaby · Australian songbird Lenka delights audiences with her junior album Shadows, which will be released in the United States on June 4. Lenka first gained popularity with her 2008 song “The Show.” – Courtesy of BB Gun Press
Lenka rose to fame with her worldwide chart-topping track, “The Show,” in which she crooned the catchy lyrics, “I’m just a little bit caught in the middle / Life is a maze and love is a riddle.”
But unlike “The Show,” it’s doubtful that Lenka’s new album will catch radio airtime — none of her songs stand out as material fit for the general public accustomed to the poppy sounds of Taylor Swift and Demi Lovato.
Then again, maybe she never intended for this album to attain the same commercial fame as her earlier work. Lenka’s carefully formulated refrains belong in the atmosphere of small boutique shops and coffee parlors — not as retail store jingles.
Early in the album, Lenka latches onto the music industry’s infatuation with handclaps in “Heart to the Party.” She sings in the chorus, “So, bring your heart to the party / I wanna dance all night in the darkness daring / Bring your heart to the party.” But her lyrics don’t conjure up images of booze-laden bachelorette outings or rooftop extravaganzas. Just one look at her music video — filled with the youthful innocence of toddlers, green pastures and bright colors — will reveal how Lenka’s recent role as a mother has influenced her music.
The delicate, mellow nature of Shadows reflects a maturity which may be attributed to her new roles as a mother and a wife. Whatever the causes, her experimentation in Shadows has succeeded. Lenka seems to improve with age, catering to both her loyal fanbase that favors her energetic vibes and a newer crowd, more likely to enjoy slower selections.
“No Harm Tonight,” one of the most mesmerizing tracks of this collection, begins with the whimsical sound of a musicbox. It progresses into a more complex tune of piano, violin and drums. The song picks up its pace at the chorus as Lenka sings, “Your shadows will fly away / Your ships will sail away / No, nothing will harm you tonight.”
Musicians sometimes follow the unfortunate trend of crafting ballads that are nearly identical in sound and style, but luckily each one of Lenka’s songs prevails in its own distinct way. By forgoing repetition, Lenka pleases ears and prevents fingers from skipping songs.
The only disappointing track is “Honeybee;” its overly tender disposition and lackluster pace makes it difficult to sit through and enjoy.
The BBC once dubbed her the “canny hybrid of Regina Spektor and Kate Nash.” But in Shadows, Lenka’s deviation from her typically upbeat arrangements makes it more difficult to draw comparisons to other artists.
The album title is certainly fitting: Shadows is sometimes dark and sometimes flighty, but a brilliant portrait of its creator. As this artist builds her discography over the coming years, we can only wonder what she’ll conjure up next.
So cough up that extra cash for Shadows, out now, and let Lenka’s tender tunes lull you into sleep. You can also feel good about your purchase for another reason — she has launched a unique pre-order campaign that donates to Save the Children, a U.K. charity that provides relief to the underprivileged in developing nations.

Hiring a new head coach can solve only some of the woes for USC’s men’s basketball team, but an import of fresh talent will at least give the Trojans some much-needed depth. Within the past three weeks, the Trojans have added two transfers eligible to play in the 2014-15 season according to various reports, though not yet confirmed by USC.
Reinforcements needed · With junior Dewayne Dedmon’s surprising decision to enter the 2013 NBA Draft, USC could use more help up front. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
UNLV guard Katin Reinhardt will transfer to USC, multiple outlets reported last Thursday. As a freshman, the former Mater Dei standout, who verbally committed to USC as a high school junior before reopening his recruitment, averaged 10.1 points, 2.5 assists and 2.0 rebounds per game during the 2012-13 season.
The move comes as a surprise to many, considering the extensive playing time Reinhardt received in his first season for the Rebels. But sources close to Reinhardt speculate that he believes his most certain path to the NBA is as a point guard, and USC offers him a greater opportunity to play the position. At UNLV, Reinhardt had settled into more of a spot-up shooting role as a shooting guard playing off of the ball.
Joining Reinhardt as another transfer is former Charlotte 49ers forward Darion Clark, who announced on May 19 that he will enroll at USC, according to Rick Lewis of the Phenom Hoop Report.
Clark, a 6-foot-6 sophomore, comes from Oak Hill Academy, where he played as a member of the national championship team. Clark averaged 6.2 points and 4.6 rebounds per game with a 54.2 shooting percentage from the field in his only season with Charlotte. A player praised for his rebounding talent, Clark also showed a scoring touch, tallying a personal record-high 17 points in a losing effort in February against Dayton, a team that the Trojans eked out a 63-61 overtime victory against last December.
NCAA transfer rules dictate that players who transfer from one Division I team to another must sit out the next season before regaining eligibility unless granted a hardship waiver by the NCAA — a process that allowed junior center Omar Oraby to play  for USC in the 2012-13 season after transferring from Rice at the beginning of the fall. Both Reinhardt and Clark will have three years of eligibility remaining beginning in 2014-15, assuming neither qualifies for the waiver.
Despite both commitments, the loss of veteran presence on the court, particularly junior center Dewayne Dedmon to the NBA draft and forward Eric Wise and guard Jio Fontan to graduation, calls for more immediate attention and still leaves new USC head coach Andy Enfield’s 2013-14 squad with gaps begging to be filled.

Michael Rosenthal’s collegiate water polo career might have ended in December when the Trojans defeated UCLA to capture the national championship, but his legacy in the pool is still far from complete. Rosenthal was named to the USA National team and will get his first taste of action when the squad will competes in the FINA World League Super Final on June 11-16 in Russia.

Rosenthal, the MVP of this season’s NCAA tournament, will join fellow Trojan alumni Shea Buckner and Tommy Corcoran on team USA. The Trojan trio makes up one-fifth of the 15-man team, coached by former Serbian national coach Dejan Udovicic.
The journey to the pinnacle of USA water polo has been a long one for Rosenthal, who first joined the Cadet team back in 2004. After competing with the Cadet team in Hungary, redshirting his first season at USC in 2008 and going on to win four consecutive national titles with the Trojans as an active player, he will now play against the best of the best international players.
Rosenthal was the third-highest scoring Trojan in his senior season, blasting a career-high 31 goals on the way to an undefeated season. He capped off the stellar campaign with a hat trick in the national championship game to earn MVP honors in the tournament. He scored in 19 of the Trojans’ 29 contests this past season, seven of which were multi-goal efforts.
Though the selection to the USA national team is a major milestone in Rosenthal’s career, it certainly does not mark the end of it. After competing in Russia, Rosenthal will have a chance to compete for a spot on the USA Olympic team for the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.

USC’s second-ranked varsity women’s rowing team ended their 2013 season on a high note, finishing a program-best fourth in the NCAA Division 1 Women’s Rowing Championships in Indianapolis on Sunday.

To highlight the final day of races, USC’s varsity four made the podium, claiming silver in the fours grand final, while the Trojans’ second varsity team  of eight earned a fourth place finish, their best of the 2013 season. The varsity eight also capped off the day with a sixth-place finish in its grand final.
“I’m very happy with the performance of the four,” said USC coach Zenon Babraj. “Even though the 2V8 came in fourth, I think that was a great race. If they would have been on a stroke, they could have been second. The difference between second and fourth was so small.”
Babraj expressed confidence that both of those boats met their lofty expectations, but was less pleased with the varsity eight.
“Both of those boats performed up to their potential. They were full speed and were each very close to Ohio State, which had been a dominant team all season. As for the performance of the varsity eight, I’d have to say that it’s disappointing. They couldn’t handle the pressure today and had an unfortunately poor run in the final.”
No. 1 Ohio State lived up to its ranking, as they captured their first-ever team championship —  a first for any Big Ten school — by winning the II Eights and Fours Events. With those wins, they racked up 126 points, which barely edged out the Golden Bears of California who finished with 124 points after winning the varsity eight title. Princeton finished third with 112 points and the Trojans followed with 110 points.
USC had all three of their boats in the grand finals and started the day strong with a second place finish by the varsity four, as they raced the course in a record 7:11.03 to claim 21 points for the Women of Troy. In the race, the four came out strong and led midway through the race, but could not hang on, as Ohio State came from behind to win.
Coxed by Paige Fernandes, the four of Katherine Gleadow at stroke, Darian DiCianno, Eglit Vosu and bow Kajsa Olsson gave USC its best finish for a four since coach Babraj joined the program in 2003. Gleadow had taken over stroke duties just two weeks prior to the championships.
“The change in our lineup brought us a different kind of confidence because it was something new and something different,” Fernandes said. “Eglit [Vosu] and Kajsa [Olsson] rowed behind Kate [Gleadow] at NCAAs last year in the 2V8 and they had a strong finish. I think they trusted her and they knew that when push comes to shove at the last 1,000 meters of the race, they knew that she was going to be there for them.”
Babraj also highlighted freshman standout DiCianno.
“Darian being a freshman, that’s incredible to go out there and get second at the NCAA championships. It says a lot about how great an asset she is to us.”
USC’s second varsity eight, coxed by Kellyn Freire, notched the program’s best-ever finish in the NCAA II Eights event and earned 38 points for the Trojans, which gave them a firm hold on second place in the team standings through two events.
In the day’s main event, USC’s varsity eight finished a disappointing sixth place in a time of 6:28.29, as it made its fourth consecutive appearance in the NCAA grand final.
The Women of Troy cap off the season with a program-best fourth-place finish at the NCAA championships and now enter the offseason.

Brown’s proposal is no cure-all, but offers long-awaited aid to the state’s most vulnerable students.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
Brown’s proposal could be the biggest change to public school funding in California in 40 years. Currently, the allocation of state funds to districts is based on an outdated formula from the 1970s, in which the amount a district receives depends on whether it is located in an agricultural area or not. This model has no equity and unfairly links the funding of a child’s education to his parents’ socioeconomic status.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the LCFF redistributes funds from well-performing school districts to struggling districts that serve higher concentrations of low-income students, English learners or foster children, thereby giving the neediest districts much-needed resources to supplement the state’s most vulnerable categories of students.
Furthermore, no districts will lose funding under the proposal so it’s not merely a zero-sum redistribution of funds — districts with higher concentrations of low-performing students won’t take away from other districts.
This redistribution of resources has raised concerns over whether increased spending per pupil will necessarily lead to higher academic performance. Critics argue that the plan lacks provisions to make sure the money isn’t misappropriated. In fact, a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll conducted in March revealed that 30 percent of respondents felt local school boards had “little or no confidence in their local boards to make the right calls.”
Administrators can just as easily claim the lion’s share of the new funds while teachers and other programs are shortchanged. But Californians need only look in their own backyard to see how highly paid administrators can provide a good education. The University of California system has been the target of much criticism regarding the hefty salaries that its administrators earn and yet the UC system remains arguably the best public school system in the nation, if not the world.
Regardless of where funds go, Brown’s proposal avoids the potential of misallocation by including accountability measures into his proposal. By not restricting how much money goes into what kind of categories of spending, districts have greater latitude to spend as they see fit for their individual needs while the dollars still go to ensuring the ultimate goal of higher academic achievement among pupils.
For some, that might mean increasing programs to support ESL students. For others, it means attracting better administrators with higher salaries.
As with many attempts at solving complex issues, many argue that LCFF does little to solve the various roots of the problem such as improving Americans’ attitudes regarding teachers and the tenure system. Yes, those are big problems that plague not just California’s but the nation’s education system as a whole.
Deep reform, however, is disruptive and introduces a lot of growing pains for students, and the effects of such reform might not be seen for decades down the road. By no means is this writer suggesting legislators forgo substantial reform in favor of short-term fixes — but there’s no reason we can’t do both.
Furthermore, there is the problem with the intangible qualities that facilitate a better education system. For example, many high-performing nations such as Finland and Japan have cultures of greater esteem for the teaching profession, which attracts better teachers and generates higher salaries.
But how does one cultivate respect for teachers in the United States? There is no legislating respect. So Brown is working for today’s children in the hopes that even an incrementally better educated workforce will pay off dividends for California’s future.

Brown means well with, but fails to address the underlying issues for true education reform in California.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
 
The governor’s proposal, which centers on the idea that the quality of a child’s education should not be contingent upon the socioeconomic status of his parents, is not only justified, but commendable. However, a redistribution of taxpayer dollars will not solve the deep-seated issues faced by California — and America’s — broken education system, which overpays administrators at the expense of students and does not prioritize the quality of teachers.
If giving school districts more money guarantees better test scores, America would not be doing so poorly among developed countries. According to EdSource, the U.S. spent an average of $11,824 per pupil in 2010, more than $2,000 per student than the average OECD country spent. Still, American students were outperformed by 16 countries when it came to international test scores.
Domestically, Washington D.C. led the pack in per-pupil funding in 2012, yet ended up placing 40th in student performance. Moreover, in California, with the way that state and federal educational policies are set up, the most economically challenged schools already receive about 36 percent more money per student than the most affluent districts according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
The question is no longer how much we spend, but where that money goes. By international standards, the U.S. is spending more than enough but are not getting our money’s worth because the education dollars don’t actually end up in the classroom.
For every dollar that the government gave to Washington state school districts in 2010, only $0.59 went to the classroom wrote the Washington Policy Center. The rest? Straight into the paychecks of administrators. According to Connection Newspapers, the average salary for a school administrator is more than $100,000, and in many school districts, they account for almost half of “education employees.”
That’s not to say that administrators don’t have the ability to make a big impact, but the people who are truly able to make a positive difference in the lives of students are teachers, who bring home a much smaller paycheck.
The common denominator of the countries that lead in education performance is not per pupil spending, but something else: teacher respect. In countries such as Finland, Japan and South Korea, teaching is a venerable profession that offers a good salary and consistently draws the brightest students according to the New York Times.
The story is quite different in the U.S. In a September 2010 study done by McKinsey & Company and published by the New York Times, it was estimated that nearly half of school teachers come from the bottom third of their graduating class — in terms of SAT scores.
This study has been disputed by scholars and journalists alike -— and rightly so because it’s a fact that there are many brilliant, enthusiastic and dedicated teachers in America. However, that brilliance, enthusiasm, and dedication is the exception, not the norm. America’s schools are plagued with teachers who are unqualified, burnt out or just don’t care.
Another culprit is America’s outdated and counterproductive tenure system. Most teachers are offered tenure after as little as two years of teaching, after which it becomes increasingly difficult to fire them according to Time. The purpose of this system was to provide teachers with a sense of job security and and prevent them from being dismissed as a result of discrimination. The result is that experienced teachers become complacent because it is difficult and expensive to remove them.
If Brown wants to get California schools out of the rut, a major reformation must occur.
Shuffling money from the rich to the poor will not solve any long-term problems. The problem lies in our backward values system, and the solution needs to start with more stringent teacher qualifications and greater respect for them all.
