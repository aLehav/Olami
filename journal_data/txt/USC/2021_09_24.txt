When the trailer dropped in May 2021 for the upcoming “Dear Evan Hansen” movie, Twitter collectively laughed, and many wrote off the film because of its choice to cast a 28-year-old Ben Platt in the titular role of Evan Hansen. 
Although Twitter was right to laugh at Platt playing a high schooler, Universal’s “Dear Evan Hansen” is a heartfelt-nostalgia-ridden depiction of the loneliness facing high school students, and well, all of us.
The film follows Evan Hansen, a 17-year-old boy struggling with depression and social anxiety. A miscommunication around a therapy assignment causes a family to believe Evan is their recently deceased son Connor’s best friend. Evan then fabricates an elaborate tale where he is best friends with Connor, who died by suicide, to please the Murphy family (Amy Adams, Danny Pino and Kaitlyn Dever) and, well, himself. 
Evan suffers from severe social anxiety, depression and loneliness. For him, the welcoming Murphy family is his chance to escape from reality and to become the person he wants to be.
In a college roundtable discussion hosted by Universal on Aug. 25, the talent and brains behind the film sat down with college students to discuss their adaption of the Tony Award-winning musical. 
Despite cutting fan-favorite songs and making relatively notable additions to the popular plot, the movie works. Musical fans may be upset by the exclusion of the touching duet, “Anybody have a map,” but by cutting certain songs, the writer was able to add new additions to the plot, strengthening the overall quality of the film.
In addition to new scenes, the film setting allowed beloved performances to become larger than life. As director Stephen Chbosky and writer Steven Levenson see it, “certain moments [from the musical] begged for a bigger telling.” 
The medium of the film allowed Chobsky to create a heartbreaking setup for “Requiem,” a song performed by members of Connor’s family simultaneously experiencing three different and unique depictions of grief. Chobsky heartbreakingly contrasts the Murphy family’s experiences as they cope with their pain through his use of parallel close ups, allowing the viewer to understand the complexity of the family’s pain. Brilliant writing by Levenson and beautiful execution by Chobsky create a heart wrenching and incredibly moving scene.
Smartly, Chobsky’s rendition of “Dear Evan Hansen’’ expanded the character of Alana (Amandla Stenberg). A side character in the original play, film Alana is a complex main character, a choice that can be credited to Levenson. And, in taking on the expanded role of Alana, Stenberg worked with Levenson to do her justice and make sure that she did not turn into the “token sidekick Black girl character.” Stenberg wants viewers to see, “a really comprehensive view of [Alana’s] internal life,” and how for her, “something that was really important was that [Levenson and I] dived into [Alana’s] mental health journey” by watching her struggle with anxiety and seeing her take prescribed medication. 
Stenberg is, “really excited to be playing a Black girl who is on medication.” 
For Stenberg, Alana is a step toward progressing conversations regarding mental health and medication usage as it is “not something normalized in the Black community,” or at least, as Stenberg specifies, in her family. 
Stenberg’s acting is incredible, and she emerges as a shining star amid an all-star cast. Alana’s story is the best difference between the stage and film versions of “Dear Evan Hansen.” 
Although the movie has its highs, its Ben Platt problem is too big to be ignored. In the play, Evan is a meek, shy, 17-year-old boy. So, when he frauds a family into believing he is their dead son’s best friend, it is easier to sympathize with him because he is a child suffering from his own mental health issues and striving to fit in.
In the film, Evan does not look like a child. He looks like a 28-year-old man. So, when he commits horrendous acts, you hate him. The audience does not want to sympathize with Evan’s struggles because Evan looks like a grown man who should know better. 
Although Platt is a talented actor with a beautiful voice, he was not the right fit for the movie. His presence diminishes the overall emotional impact of the film, and frankly, he should not have been casted. Platt had an incredible run on Broadway (and has a Tony award to prove it). His time as Evan should have ended in 2017, when he stepped away from the play. Bringing him back was a mistake, and Evan should have gone to a much younger actor who could physically do the part justice. 
Despite its glaring flaw, “Dear Evan Hansen” is an extraordinary adaptation of the award-winning musical. Its message that “we are not alone” is painfully poignant following a year and a half of social distancing and isolation.

Designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Renzo Piano, the new 300,000-square-foot Academy Museum of Motion Pictures at the corner of Wilshire and Fairfax is a wonderful hub honoring the arts and sciences of film itself. The opening press event held on Sept. 21 included opening remarks from a slew of accomplished actors, executives and Piano himself, as well as opportunities to tour all of the exhibits and meet curators and screenings of selected shorts. Attendees were given the full museum experience. Opening Sept. 30 to the general public, the museum — which could become a sightseeing must in Los Angeles — will allow people to appreciate the process and behind-the-scenes efforts of filmmaking.
Named after Sidney Poitier, the entrance and main lobby of the museum includes the gift shop and Fanny’s, a restaurant and cafe named after Barbara Streisand’s Oscar-winning character in “Funny Girl”(1968).  The idea for this museum has been a work in progress for a long time coming.
“Since 1929, when the first Academy board and its president Douglas Fairbanks dreamt of a museum devoted to motion pictures, our governors through the decades have sought to realize that dream,” said David Rubin, president of the Academy. 
As this vision became closer to becoming a reality, numerous individuals, corporations, foundations and government entities came together to build the museum. 
“I wanted to support the Academy Museum to remind future generations of the legends who have paved the roads for all of us,”Oprah Winfrey said in a video shown during the opening remarks of the press conference highlighting benefactors of the museum. “When I heard that the main lobby of the museum was going to be named for Sidney Poitier, I wanted to just shout for joy because, he is not only a personal hero, he’s a hero for the Academy, the first Black man to win an Oscar before there was even a Civil Rights Act, and he just so deserves to have that space be an honor to his name.” 
“Stories of Cinema,” the museum’s core exhibit designed by WHY architecture, is primarily divided between the Spielberg Family Gallery and the Wanda Gallery on the first and second floors of the museum, culminating in the Rolex Gallery on the third floor. From costuming to casting, props and set design and every little detail in between that makes up the motion pictures that audiences enjoy on the screen, the museum has it all. 
One of the most aesthetically charming exhibits, is the limited-time exhibition “Hayao Miyazaki,” in honor of the renowned animator and co-founder of animation powerhouse Studio Ghibli, known for “My Neighbor Totoro” (1988), “Kiki’s Delivery Service” (1989), “Spirited Away” (2001), “Howl’s Moving Castle” (2004) and “Ponyo” (2008). With a blue-green color palette that is soft on the eyes, the exhibit, located in the Marilyn and Jeffrey Katzenberg Gallery, offers insight into the intricate paintings made with acrylic poster paint or watercolor that were eventually carefully transformed into animations. The exhibit is definitely a must-see, considering that many of the images have never previously been diplayed beyond Japan.
The exhibit, designed with the idea of a kid-friendly environment, reflects the themes of Studio Ghibli Films.
“From early on, the tutorial content and design was completely intertwined. And the product was a byproduct of that relationship,” said Shraddha Aryal, vice president of exhibition design and production at the museum. “It’s undulating, it’s organic, it’s fun. We had very much kids in mind, [a] tactile quality to it.” 
Whether one is older, younger or somewhere in between, the Hayao Miyazaki exhibit somehow manages to feel modern and nostalgic all at once. 
A very refreshing component of the museum is the acknowledgement of diversity in filmmaking. 
“As someone who has been dedicated to elevating the film industry in Korea, I’m proud of the truly international view of movies and movie makers that is built into the academy museum,” said Miky Lee, vice-chair of the Academy Museum’s Board of Trustees. “Now, the Academy Museum is giving the public an unprecedented opportunity to connect at any time with experiences of people everywhere, as seen through their films.” 
The continuation of the “Stories of Cinema” exhibit in the Rolex Gallery provides a space for highlighting an accomplished and well-rounded roster of international filmmakers. Beginning with the works of Pedro Almodóvar, the exhibit is not only extremely well-designed with bright, modern colors, but also includes 12 screens that feature a significant theme or scene from the award-winning director’s notable work. The exhibit as a whole is an opportunity for viewers to learn more about filmmaking outside of the United States. 
“The Path to Cinema: Highlights from the Richard Balzer Collection,” an exhibit filled with a wide variety of optical toys and pre-cinematic devices, especially impressed Academy Trustee and actor Tom Hanks.
“In the past, that was the power of a projected image that told some story in a dark room, that made people like all of us want to go inside that dark room and be transported to another place,” Hanks said. “ That’s what motion pictures do, I think, every single one of us can remember, not just a movie that moved us, but also the theater that we saw it in, where it was located.”
As thrilling as the world of Hollywood and entertainment often seems, the film industry has its fair share of issues from lack of diversity to workplace harassment. The Academy Museum addresses these topics, displaying panels about Black Lives Matter, sex-based discrimination and the #MeToo movement, while also providing multiple examples of films to watch to encourage further education on these topics such as “Bombshell” (2019), “The Invisible War” (2012) and “I Am Not Your Negro” (2016). 
The museum evidently does not shy away from tough conversations and ensures that the right stories are shared with the public. One exhibit, “Backdrop: An Invisible Art,” is a 34-foot double-height installation that displays the painting of Mount Rushmore used in “North by Northwest” (1959). 
While the sheer grandeur and size of this presentation is quite breathtaking and makes for a nice photo spot, the Academy museum addresses Mount Rushmore’s controversial and painful history. With an exhibit description titled “Wamaka Ogna Ke Icante” (The Heart of Everything That Is), the museum educates the attendees on the historical oppression of Indigenous people that is tied to the National Memorial, especially because for the Lakota community, Mount Rushmore desecrates their sacred land. 
Arguably, the magnum opus of the museum is “The Oscars Experience” in the East West Bank Gallery where attendees can first hand experience the thrill of winning a coveted Academy Award with the purchase of a separate $15 ticket on top of general admission. With simulations to portray the famous Dolby Theatre where the best of filmmaking convenes every year, one can hold a real, eight and a half pound Oscar trophy, finishing the experience with a high-quality, multi-angular, memorable video being sent right to their inbox minutes later. 
It is a thrilling experience, especially for those who hope to one day see themselves on the real awards stage. I was lucky enough to win the award for Best Director (for my unreleased, coming-of-age indie film), but perhaps you could win for Best Adapted Screenplay or Best Animated Feature. 
Built in L.A., the epicenter of filmmaking, visiting the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures is a one-of-a-kind, transformative experience that has something of interest for every film enthusiast. By acknowledging the diversity at the forefront of popular cinema and also the accomplishments and advances of the past, this museum is an inclusive and educational space that offers something very special to L.A. and film enthusiasts globally. 
It could be a major source of inspiration for directors, writers, actors, cinematographers, executives, musicians, costume designers and more, everywhere. The attention to accessibility and detail in every aspect of the museum’s design leads to multifaceted conversations that are more than necessary in the art of filmmaking. The world of cinema is special because it has the power to make audiences feel something, and this museum is a way to make visitors from all over the world feel something very special.

Women’s soccer begins Pac-12 conference play Friday with a home game against Oregon State. The Beavers are undefeated so far, posting an 8-0 record to start the season. The Trojans come into the game with a streak of their own, earning five consecutive victories, four of which came in away matches.
USC finalized its run of non-conference matches against CSUN Sunday, adding a 4-0 victory to the win column. Oregon State, meanwhile, is coming off a narrow home victory over North Dakota in a five-goal thriller that ended 3-2 in the Beavers’ favor. Oregon State has scored 21 goals while only conceding six this season. USC has managed 20 goals and conceded seven. 
“The mentality stays the same, continuing to try to get better every time we go out,” said head coach Keidane McAlpine in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I didn’t think we came out to the last game [CSUN] with the right energy to start the game … I think that’s the mentality, get in the game right away, making sure we’re doing the right things, making sure we’re giving the proper energy. Both teams are coming into Pac-12 play 0-0, and I think that is how we should approach it.”
Oregon State’s in-form striker, freshman McKenna Martinez, has contributed six goals this season, two of which came against North Dakota. 
“[Oregon State is] an extremely hard-working team,” McAlpine said. “[Head coach] Lauren Sinacola has done a good job in her first year with the team. They have a belief about them right now that’s really good … It is going to be important for us to take care of the ball, especially in our defensive third, and be able to turn their pressure against them.”
Despite receiving limited playing time at the beginning of the season, senior forward Penelope Hocking is in prolific form, scoring four goals in her last three matches. Hocking was last season’s Pac-12 Forward of the Year and earned a place in the All-Pac-12 first team. 
Junior midfielder Croix Bethune has also contributed five goals so far this season, with her brace proving vital in USC’s 3-0 victory over UCSB. Senior goalkeeper Anna Smith will hold it down between the sticks against Oregon State’s efficient offense. Smith’s 11 saves against Michigan in a narrow 1-0 victory earned her Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Week recognition. 
“[The defensive] group of six and Anna [Smith], if they can hold things down and provide proper defensive moments but also keep the ball long enough to get to our front half — then I think we create enough chances in every game that we have the ability to win the game,” McAlpine said.
So far this season, USC has nine different goalscorers and 11 players with at least one assist. The variety of contributors demonstrates the depth in McAlpine’s squad rotation and his emphasis on teamwork and ball movement. 
“One of the things that, as [a] staff, we looked at coming into the season [was] just going back and looking at our best teams ever and [they were] always really deep teams,” McAlpine said. “What you are seeing is a lot of players starting to understand their roles and understand what is being asked. We work hard to increase communication and the energy that you provide to the team.”
The Trojans will kick off their first Pac-12 match of the season against the Beavers Friday at 4 p.m at Soni McAlister Field.

One of the biggest headlines in college football last week was USC firing former head coach Clay Helton. Already on shaky ground coming into the season, the 42-28 loss to Stanford at the Coliseum on Sept. 11 sealed Helton’s fate. He was fired the following Monday. The team promoted cornerbacks coach and associate head coach Donte Williams to interim head coach for the rest of the season. 
In the meantime, USC will conduct a “national search,” according to Athletic Director Mike Bohn in a tweet he put out Sept. 13, for the best person to be USC’s next head coach. 
Here are some current options that USC may pursue. 
No. 5: Urban Meyer | NFL Head Coach — Jacksonville Jaguars
The former college head coach who brought championships to Ohio State and Florida is now testing the waters in the NFL as the Jacksonville Jaguars’ head coach. 
Although Meyer has a top talent in Trevor Lawrence at his disposal, it hasn’t necessarily translated into wins. The team lost its first two games of the season, and, if it continues this way, Meyer might have an early exit from professional football. 
USC would be an optimal landing spot for Meyer, where he can recruit and transform the program for the better. Obviously, a lot of things need to go wrong for him in the NFL for this to happen, but there is still a chance. 
No. 4: Chris Petersen | Former College Head Coach — Washington Huskies
Even though Petersen no longer coaches, he could elevate the Trojans to reach the Playoff for the first time in the school’s history. Petersen  accomplished this with another Pac-12 school — Washington.  
Petersen only recently left the sport in 2019, so USC may have a chance at bringing him back to the game. Peterson’s experience in elevating a program to the highest level of collegiate play might give the Trojans a chance to win it all. 
Throughout his career, Petersen boasted an impressive 79.5% win rate between his time with Washington and Boise State, totaling 147 wins in 185 games. This type of winning mindset is exactly what the Trojans need now. 
No. 3: Eric Bieniemy | NFL Offensive Coordinator — Kansas City Chiefs
A Southern California native, Bieniemy would be an intriguing hire for the Trojans. USC is known for its air-raid offense, and who better to implement this philosophy than the offensive coordinator of one of the most prolific pass offenses in the NFL currently — the Kansas City Chiefs.
Bieniemy has been a frequent head coaching candidate in the NFL and made the Super Bowl in back-to-back years with the Chiefs. However, CBS Sports reported that he is open to the USC position, if he’s available. 
It would be quite a return home for Bieniemy if selected to bring his professional experience to USC.  
It is also worth noting that Bieniemy was the offensive coordinator at Colorado during Bohn’s tenure as athletic director.
No. 2: Luke Fickell | College Head Coach — Cincinnati Bearcats
Cincinnati’s program has gradually improving every season under Fickell, and the team is now competing in the top 10 rankings. A lot of praise can be attributed to head coach Luke Fickell, who was able to get the Bearcats an AAC title last season and went toe-to-toe against Georgia in the Peach Bowl. 
What makes this hire more intriguing is that Bohn served as the athletic director for Cincinnati when they hired Fickell. There could be a chance for this hire to happen again to help the Trojans consistently make the top 10.
No. 1: James Franklin | College Head Coach — Penn State Nittany Lions
The best candidate for USC to go after for the head coach opening should be current Penn State head coach James Franklin. In his nearly 10 years at Penn State, Franklin has brought great success to the program. Under his leadership, Penn State won the Big 10 and bowl games such as the Cotton and Fiesta Bowls. 
The reason why this pairing works so well is that Penn State constantly has trouble making the playoffs, since it has powerhouse Ohio State in its conference and division. So, to have an easier path to the playoffs through the Pac-12, Franklin will be the perfect match to get the Trojans a playoff berth.

USC interim head coach Donte Williams grew up just 2.5 miles away from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. On Saturday night, the native Californian will lead his squad out of the tunnel in his first home game as interim when USC faces Oregon State. 
The Trojans and Beavers are both 2-1, coming off blowout victories last week. 
Oregon State comfortably defeated Idaho 42-0 last week in the Beavers’ first shutout since 2008. Their defense headlined the win as it held the Idaho offense to just 192 yards. 
USC comes off a win where it scored 45 straight points in its 45-14 victory over Washington State. Freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart’s 391 passing yards smashed the USC record for most passing yards in a debut. Sophomore wide receiver Gary Bryant Jr. came alive with his first two career touchdowns. 
The big question for the Trojans this week had been who will start at quarterback. However, it was reported by USCFootball.com that Dart underwent surgery for a torn meniscus and is out for an extended period of time.
The Trojans avoided talking about Dart’s status. Williams, when asked about Dart at practice Tuesday, said he’s only worried about who’s on the practice field for the week. 
“He wasn’t here today,” Williams said. “Today was pretty much about Kedon and [third-string freshman quarterback] Miller [Moss], and I am happy to talk about those two.”
The Beavers are also dealing with quarterback problems of their own. 
Oregon State began the year with Colorado transfer graduate student Sam Noyer as its starting quarterback. He was pulled in the middle of Oregon State’s first game after struggling against Purdue. Redshirt sophomore Chance Nolan, the expected third string quarterback coming into fall camp, was thrust into action. 
Nolan threw for three touchdowns and was 14 of 19 through the air in the win against Idaho. The former junior college standout and Southern California native seems to have grabbed hold of the starting spot. 
Defensive coordinator Todd Orlando spoke highly of Nolan’s toughness at his practice press conference this week. 
“He’s a tough kid,” Orlando said. “Those are the guys that are dangerous. The guys that have the arm, that can run, but also have the mentality too. He’s a really, really good player.”
While the Beavers have played three games this season, the jury is still out on what kind of team they will be this year. Oregon State was picked to finish fifth in the Pac-12 north just ahead of Washington State but has started the season 2-1. 
The Beavers lead the Pac-12 in all-purpose yards per game with over 450. Their defense tops the Pac-12 in interceptions with five, and their nine tackles for loss are second in the Pac-12. With their two wins coming against teams who are both 1-2 through the young season, Saturday night’s Pac-12 opener will be a real benchmark for Oregon State. 
For USC, the quarterback intrigue will be the headline, but it’s the supporting cast that could play a huge role. 
Bryant Jr. already matched his reception total from last season. On the defensive side, freshman Calen Bullock worked himself into the first team and led the team in tackles for the second time in three games a week ago. 
USC is back at home, and for the first time in five years, Helton won’t be leading the charge. Williams called on USC fans to pack the Coliseum for his homecoming debut.  
“I hope it’s crazy,” Williams said. “I hope it’s a sellout. I hope everyone that’s in there is happy to cheer on the Trojans and we play the way everyone is accustomed to us playing.”

After USC’s first game of the 2021 season, junior outside linebacker Drake Jackson had plenty to celebrate. 
The Trojans’ defense gave up only seven points and forced two turnovers — Jackson himself had an impressive interception. However, in Jackson’s post-game interview, the focus wasn’t on his performance or what the team did but more on the impact his family has on him.
“I was just more thinking about my grandma,” Jackson said. “I was happy I did that for her because it’s my first game without her.”
Family means the world to Jackson — a soft spot for the 6-foot-4, 250-pound linebacker. He carries them everywhere on his journey to prove himself. More specifically, he carries them with a tattoo on his right forearm that says: “Compton,” Jackson’s hometown. 
“Coming from Compton, a lot of people don’t make it out,” Jackson said. “I [got to] put on for my city … I got to show that Compton is real.” 
The Birth Certificate 
When a child is born, one of the parents’ first duties is to fill out the birth certificate. Many decide to go simple by including a first and last name. 
But Dennis Jackson had a bigger idea. A lifelong USC fan, he took his son’s birth certificate and wrote: ​​“Drake Jackson, University of Southern California, outside linebacker, 265 pounds.”
“When I was being born, my dad said, manifested [and] praised to God that I go to USC,” Jackson said. “Now for me to be in my last year where I really feel like the guy and weigh how much he said, it’s just crazy to me how everything really works out.”
The nurses didn’t allow the birth certificate to include that information, but Dennis spoke it into existence. 
The process of getting to this moment started early. Family played a key role for Jackson as he would often work out with his father when growing up. Dennis was the first coach Jackson had and frequently put him against the older kids in little league. 
Jackson credits these early experiences to making his transition to USC as smooth as possible. 
“When I come to college, and I’m at any grade, there’s gonna be people older than me, but it’s still the same,” Jackson said. “It’s just like little league.” 
Always a soft-spoken character, Jackson let his game do the talking. It was a specific game during his sophomore year in high school where everything changed for Jackson. 
Centennial High School in Corona, Calif. — where Jackson attended, was playing the prominent IMG Academy from Florida, a school known for its football talent. It was his first game as a starter, and Jackson didn’t live up to expectations: “I didn’t really know what to do in the first half,” he said.
Jackson’s coach told him at halftime that his time was up; He’d been subbed out. 
“He’s like, ‘I’m gonna take you out; you’re hurting the team right now,’” Jackson said. “And I’m like, ‘Nah, just wait. You’ll see.’” 
In the next half, Jackson ended up with two sacks, making his presence felt on the defensive line. It was the start of a run that put him on the map. 
Two seasons later, Jackson became a four-star recruit and the Press-Enterprise’s Defensive Player of the Year in 2018. The Trojans weren’t the only ones coming after him aggressively as Jackson made official visits to Oregon, Illinois, Washington and Arizona State. 
Much to his father’s delight, Jackson ended up a Trojan.
USC and “The Freak”
His freshman year, Jackson was at the beach with his friends one day when a thought came into his head. It wasn’t really a normal one, but he thought he’d give it a shot. 
Since he was a kid with inconceivable athleticism, Jackson did backflips on trampolines. He would twirl around for fun and reach heights as high as his potential. Recently though, his friend had been teaching him the basics of doing a backflip on the ground. This time, it was a little different. 
“I was like, ‘Bro, I’ll try a backflip if you try a backflip,’ and he tried it and I ended up landing mine,” Jackson said. “From then on, it’s just been like riding a bike.”
People of Jackson’s size and stature usually aren’t supposed to be able to pull off backflips — especially while in the sand. They aren’t supposed to be moving as agile as he does.
It’s why he’s grown into the nickname: “Freak.” It’s something the people around him can attest to. 
“Nah, he’s a freak for sure,” said redshirt senior linebacker Micah Croom with a chuckle. “No doubt about it.”
It seems like Jackson does something every day that makes people ask how? 
Freshman defensive lineman Korey Foreman was a teammate of Jackson’s at Centennial. To this day, he still asks Jackson about the crazy moves he pulls off in practice, in awe at how he’s able to pull it off.
“He’s a freak of nature,” Foreman said. “It’s a blessing to be able to have someone like him with such talent on the sideline with me and on the defensive line with me.”
The combination of speed, size and strength Jackson carries is rare in and of itself. 
His love and passion for the game forge an amalgamation of talent and desire to keep learning — a common theme people closest to Jackson highlighted. 
“A lot of guys with talent, when they get to this level, [they] kind of don’t love football as much as they love the fans and everything that comes with it,” said defensive coordinator Vic So’oto. “But he loves football.” 
Athletes can get lazy and revert from working hard once they reach the satisfaction of being a Division I athlete. Jackson isn’t like your average Division I athlete though, he wants to keep learning. 
Jackson focuses on the weaknesses of the players he’s competing against and works on improving each aspect of his game to “get better than the next person,” a mindset instilled in him by his father.
“​​We’ve been doing that since I was a little kid,” Jackson said. “We’ve always just been getting to the spot, seeing who we got, playing my hardest and just going from there.”
The unsatisfied mindset and hard work have paid off.
So’oto added Jackson is a player with “natural athletic ability and God-given gifts.” And, when you watch him on the field, it’s evident. 
Jackson could be on one side of an offensive tackle before spinning off of them like a tornado to chase the quarterback down. A sack can result in a lion’s roar, and his dominant play continues throughout the game.
When it’s all said and done after the game though, Jackson’s mind reverts not to his performance but something more at home. 
All the nonpareil athletic abilities and football aside, family is simply the most important thing to Jackson. Almost everything in his life revolves around it, especially this season. 
Jackson has played through the first couple of weeks of the season with a heavy heart. Right before the Trojans’ first game, a close member of his family passed away — his grandmother.
It added extra motivation for him as he embarked on his final season playing collegiate football. 
“Everything’s for her at this point in time,” Jackson said. “This is the last year she would have got to see me before I take things further into the league … Since she didn’t get to see that, this is for her. I’m doing it for her.”
Jackson’s family has kept him in check through the years. His faith and relationship with this tightly-knit family never allow the pressures of football to overwhelm him. His unique skill and force as a player truly never alter his focus and mindset. Even with his freakish talent, he’s simply a humble giant. 
As for the NFL, Jackson’s not overthinking it — he knows the work he’s put in will pay off.
“You give it to God, you work. Stuff like this, you want to happen, and when it happens, it feels good. You want more,” he said. “Now, I’m grinding for more; it keeps me hungry.”

While USC Student Health remains optimistic about current coronavirus case rates on campus, University health officials remain reluctant to ease mitigation efforts amid the upcoming flu season, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said at a Student Health media briefing Thursday. 
Of the 34,067 tests administered between Sept. 12 and Sept. 18, 59 students and four employees tested positive for the coronavirus. The updated .18% positivity rate reflects the lowest positivity trend among students since the beginning of the fall semester, and the .30% faculty positivity is slightly lower than the .38% reported last week. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, California currently has the lowest coronavirus case rate in the United States. The positivity rate in California has declined to 3.1%, a decrease of 4.1 percentage points from its peak of 7.2% on Aug. 1. Los Angeles County positivity trends stand even lower, with a seven-day average of 1.44%. 
Vaccination rates continue to increase statewide and in L.A. County — 77.8% and 68.0% of residents are fully vaccinated, respectively. However, USC continues to outperform local, state and federal vaccine rates with 95% of all students, faculty and staff fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. 
“I feel really positive about where we are as a campus and a community … If we look at where California is right now, it really is a triumph of public health,” Van Orman said. “I think we can really account for California’s success in what California did this summer in being the most proactive state in the country in responding to the delta surge.” 
Van Orman said decreasing  prevalence in the community and heightened mitigation efforts currently implemented around campus are factors behind the declining transmission rates within the USC community.
“The most important mitigation step that is emerging … the ability for people to self-isolate, get tested and do contract tracing when they have symptoms,” Van Orman said. “[It] remains the most important strategy we have [against the pandemic].” 
Van Orman said she is hopeful USC will avoid another coronavirus surge during Fall 2021 but expressed concern about “risk periods,” such as the upcoming fall break where many students will travel and engage in high-risk settings outside of the campus community. 
“[USC] has such high vaccine rates on campus, I’m hopeful that we don’t see a secondary surge,” Van Orman said. “If we can get through that midterm break period without a surge or a moderate surge, I feel confident about where we will be for the rest of the semester.” 
On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration permitted emergency use authorization of Pfizer booster shots for high-risk individuals and anyone over 65 years old. A booster shot means receiving a third dose of the coronavirus vaccine. At this time, only students and staff who are immunocompromised can receive a third coronavirus vaccine dose from the Engemann Student Health Center. 
“I think the data is pretty strong that we probably won’t need booster shots yet,” Van Orman said. “That doesn’t mean we don’t need them ever — so I think it’s right to let the science and data guide us — but the fact remains that the [vaccines] remain very protective.” 
Despite reduced case counts and positivity rates on campus and within the broader L.A. community, Student Health remains hesitant to relax coronavirus-related measures, including the weekly surveillance testing requirement and the “no-guest policy” — a coronavirus policy that restricts students from entering on-campus residential facilities that they don’t personally live in. 
“We’re continuing to evaluate how long we want to do the surveillance testing — we’ll keep watching that — I know students right now feel really positive about it,” Van Orman said. “I think the [no-guest policy] is something we could continue to evaluate -— we definitely want to ease up, [but] at the same time we just need to be cautious about protecting where people live.” 
In addition to surveillance testing, Van Orman said Student Health is monitoring the spread of the coronavirus through wastewater samples. 
“We’re doing wastewater detection in our dorms. We’re really excited — many of our dorms have had zero detections, which is terrific, and [the results] correlate with our surveillance testing,” Van Orman said. “We should be able to announce some of our wastewater testing results next week.”
Van Orman said the campus community should expect an announcement Friday detailing flu vaccination mandates for the student body. While Van Orman said she made a formal recommendation in favor of a flu shot requirement, the Presidential Leadership Team will ultimately make the final decision on campus-wide vaccination requirements. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University said it won’t reveal its final decision on a flu shot mandate until Friday.

When Kelvin Nguyen was a senior in high school, he obtained his Emergency Medical Technician certification after nine months of in-person training that consisted of ride-alongs, shifts at hospitals and training with dummies. Nguyen went through the normal application process. He was able to apply what he learned in the classroom to real life situations. 
But, with the onset of the pandemic, the certification process changed drastically. When schools moved to an online format because of safety issues surrounding the pandemic, the EMT certification process also changed to an online format. Although EMTs who obtained their certification during the pandemic learned the same information as past EMTs, such as Nguyen, they missed parts of the training, such as working with dummies and running through emergency medical scenarios in real life. 
“There’s one thing to learn how to treat a broken finger and there’s another thing to actually see a broken finger and know how to do it,” Nguyen said. “It takes a lot of mental focus to actually do that, and if you haven’t been exposed to that some people would freeze up.”
The Emergency Medical Services of the University of Southern California is a student-run organization that trains USC students to become EMTs, while also providing medical services to students and the surrounding campus community. During USC-sponsored events, including football tailgates and concerts, student EMTs are available on standby to provide first aid. Although EMSC members already obtained their EMT certification, the organization supplies constant training to EMTs to help them maintain their skills. 
“We have [our active members] go through skills training,” said Nguyen, EMSC’s director of finance. “We give our members a scenario of a patient that we would see on campus, and it is their job to determine what’s wrong with that patient and to provide the proper treatment.” 
New members don’t require more training than others, but they do need more practical experience in order to boost their confidence because they were never able to physically practice what they learned during their online EMT certification, Ferrero said. But for other EMSC members who work as EMTs outside of USC, they have more experience.
However, challenges with training EMSC’s newest members — those who were completely new to the field and those who were trained by an outside party — surfaced during the pandemic. 
Nicholas Cortez, a junior majoring in human biology, joined EMSC as a probationary member this semester, meaning that in order to remain in the program, he must avoid getting three strikes. Strikes are accumulated by failing a test or failing to show up to weekly meetings. Prior to joining, Cortez obtained his certification in Orange County, but he is currently undergoing more training with EMSC.
Cortez said he completed most of his certification process on Zoom, but for the final exam, he had to go to a testing site where he worked with dummies. He said he underwent practical exams where he was asked how we would approach different medical scenarios. 
“​​I got my certification super recently, so I got it just before this summer,” Cortez said. “This is sort of my first step as an EMT, and I’m planning on using this experience to work in the future as an EMT.”
Christina Ferrero, a junior majoring in human biology, serves as the organization’s director of training. With her EMT certification done completely in person, Ferrero worked to determine ways to best emulate her training in an online setting for new members that joined during the pandemic. 
“In terms of training considerations, it has been a bit of a challenge trying to help people gain those skills that would normally be attained in person in an online setting,” Ferrero said. “It’s not the same, not being able to actually touch your patient. That’s such an important part of being able to provide good care.” 
Ferrero said the inability to learn and practice necessary skills in person “affected students quite a bit.” 
“I’m not sure that there’s necessarily any lapse in EMT knowledge that can be obtained in the classroom, but when you haven’t had the ability to talk to patients and gain those in-person skills, there’s a big confidence issue that presents itself,” Ferrero  said. 
Although students who completed EMT online training missed the in-person experience, Nguyen said the lack of in-person training did not make the new members worse. 
“They all know the knowledge in which it takes to become an EMT, and because of our application process and how rigorous it is, we made sure that we could put trust in them treating a patient on campus, even if they haven’t done that in a while or they haven’t done it at all,” Nguyen said. 
While the online certification process created some issues, Ferrero said EMSC is ensuring its EMTs are up to the test by putting them through an intensive application process and additional training.
“Most of these people haven’t done EMT stuff in a year and a half, some of these people may have never even utilized their certification,” Ferrero said. “So we actually conducted pre-employment testing for all of our members and [are] making sure that they retained those skills and are ready to go back into the field.” 
Throughout Cortez’s probationary membership period, he is required to attend weekly meetings where he is put through scenario-based training and examinations that ensure he retains his EMT training.
“[The organization] stresses that it’s about the time commitment of a two-unit course,” Cortez said. “It’s super easy to forget what you learn in your course because there’s so much you’re learning in so little time so they really want to make sure you know everything.” 
As EMSC transitions from virtual training, the organization looks to continue addressing the issues created by the online certification of their newest members. 
“That’s a big role of EMSC,” Ferrero said. “We want to be able to boost your confidence as a healthcare provider because you know what to do. You just need the practice and the training.”

Despite winning all three of its matches in the Aggie Roundup, USC dropped to No. 2 behind rival UCLA. However, the Trojans snagged the first seed in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Invitational and are the favorites in this weekend’s top-flight tournament. 
USC has a bye Friday and will play the winner of the matchup between No. 7 UC Davis and No. 9 UC San Diego Saturday. 
“Obviously, it’s not an NCAA Tournament. We know that but we are treating it like it is one,” senior goalie Nic Porter said. “So our focus is the same [for] every game … getting ourselves ready for December when the real NCAA Tournament happens. This is great practice for us to get used to that environment.”
The Trojans seem to have an easy path to the title game — No. 3 Stanford and No. 5 UC Santa Barbara are the only real threats to upset USC — but they remain vigilant for whoever they might face.
“The games when you’re not necessarily sure who you’re playing can be the most dangerous,” junior driver Marcus Longton said. “You can let down your guard and not be completely focused when you should be.”
This is USC’s first chance to play any of the other programs in the big four: Stanford is the likely semifinal matchup, and No. 1 UCLA will battle it out with No. 3 Cal on the other side of the bracket. One of the big four has claimed every NCAA title since 1998, so the Trojans know they’ll have their hands full defensively.
“It’s all about watching as much film as I can on the teams we’re going to play,” Porter said. “Obviously it brings the best out of our defense and myself … It’s just about being mentally ready when I’m in the cage.”
Even with the talented squads ahead of them, head coach Marko Pintaric wants the team to focus on itself, especially with the bye. Pintaric plans to run real-game simulations Friday to keep his players in top form.
“You always start with yourself and what you need to fix based on our performances so far in the season,” Pintaric said. “I don’t like to have a game off … [I want] them to feel the tournament atmosphere, because it is an important tournament. In my opinion, it is the toughest tournament to play.”
USC’s opening tournament game will take place on Saturday at 8 a.m. at the Spieker Aquatics Complex at UC Berkeley.

The remote college experience left a mist of awkwardness and social anxiety; coronavirus guidelines now make it difficult to fully integrate into campus culture. With these lingering qualms, I decided to selflessly carry the responsibility of helping people. 
Whether it be a question about making friends, something going wrong in your sex life or a faraway romance, I — a self-proclaimed therapist — carefully crafted the correct answers for your questions, sent to us at the Daily Trojan.
How do I hook up with the no-visitors policy?
Who would’ve guessed that USC would be the ultimate cock-blocker of 2021? The University’s safety efforts have left many social butterflies with subpar college experiences, but my heart goes out to those in USC Housing with a high sex drive. The University gives its toughest battles to its strongest Trojans.
Don’t let USC regulations become an obstacle. Hook up with someone who lives in the same building as you, but beware, as you’re more likely to run into them again. It’s a high-reward, high-risk scenario; I only recommend this if your sex drive is unbearably high because it can lead to future awkward encounters.
The alternative is to have sex with people who don’t have similar housing restrictions. Ensure that they are trustworthy and always share your location with a friend. 
The final option — and my personal favorite — is to embrace your abstinence. Hot girl summer is over and has made room for Christian girl autumn and prudish girl winter. Hookup culture is especially prominent but highly overrated in college. Since USC housing decided that chastity is part of the lease, so be it. 
Bypassing the no-visitor policy is tough, but there are loopholes that will allow you to remain sexually active. There’s also nothing wrong with accepting defeat and welcoming chastity season.
How do I make friends? I’m a freshman and I feel really lonely, and everyone already has their groups made up. I want someone I can study with, but people tend to ignore me when I try to talk to them.
The key to making friends is putting yourself out there. USC’s a showcase, and you’re the mannequin. Look presentable and hope that someone approaches you to become your friend. 
Spending time in your dorm’s communal study space is a convenient way to socialize with people and interject in other people’s conversations — but make sure they’re the right conversations. If they ignore you, it’s likely that you’re interacting with rude people. 
USC’s Student Equity and Inclusion Programs, including the Latinx/Chicanx Center for Advocacy and Student Affairs, the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, the LGBTQ+ Student Center and more, are also safe spaces that allow for interaction between other students of similar identities. The key is to make yourself available, look friendly and converse with others, especially in the cultural centers, which tend to be met with people who favor studying in social environments.
Another option is pretending to be — or actually be — confused in classes and begin conversations with your neighbors by asking for assistance. Questions like, “Wait, what are we doing?” or “What is going on?” are my personal favorites because it’s likely that your neighbor doesn’t know what is happening either. There’s no other force that unites people better than confusion and disorientation, both of which can lead to a study group. Exert your inner (h/b)imbo energy.
Cliques shouldn’t discourage you from socializing because many friend groups are never officially made up. It’s appropriate to dabble in various groups rather than relying on a core group of friends, considering the fact that people never end their college spans with core groups from freshman year. 
You have several routes to make friends, and luckily, you can fit into various niches at USC. 
Long distance relationships: Is it worth it?
Unless well established, which most high school relationships aren’t, long distance relationships can bring more restrictions than the coronavirus. Imagine the beautiful Trader Joe’s cashier begins flirting with you, and you can’t reciprocate because you’re a prisoner to faraway love. There are too many fish in the sea, especially in college, to be tied down to a person who can’t satisfy your physical needs. Don’t have a prudish girl winter by force. 
Long distance relationships also require an extensive amount of effort, which is often not possible with the amount of time it takes to maintain an academic, social and professional balance. Endless FaceTimes, text threads and travel to visit your significant other isn’t ideal when there’s an array of people to choose from at USC – artsy people, frat bros, sorority sisters and the list goes on.
Life’s too short to worry about someone who’s 300 miles away. Save yourself from the arguments, the nine-hour calls and the expensive flights and venture out. Few long-distance relationships make it through till the end, and it’s best to explore the Trojan variety while you can.
If you need advice, feel free to reach out to Dr. Blingspice by direct messaging  Daily Trojan on Twitter and Facebook or by submitting your questions to the Google Form on our Instagram stories.

When the U.S. News and World Report published its 2022 list of Best National Colleges last week, students were surprised to see a dip in USC’s ranking. This unexpected downturn, along with the USC football team’s tragic defeat by Stanford, caused some bitterness across the University community.
USC’s national ranking has taken a slippery slope in the past few years. USC’s highest ranking for best national universities was from 2017 when it ranked No. 21 out of 311 universities, shoulder-to-shoulder with UCLA. However, USC’s rank gradually began dropping after 2017 and went from No. 22 in 2018 and 2019 to No. 24 in 2020. In the latest ranking, it ended up at No. 27.
USC’s dip in rankings starkly contrasts its rising tuition costs, which raised some dissatisfaction among students. However, the current ranking does not speak to university’s overall quality. The pandemic, along with U.S. News’ controversial ranking method, has contributed to the fluctuation of college rankings every year.
First of all, the pandemic has changed the traditional college admissions process. Many universities canceled their requirements for standardized testing, and U.S. News also adjusted its weight for student selectivity. The media company indicated on its website that its “latest data available for the ranking calculations pertained to Fall 2020 and earlier.” The institution also claimed it adjusted its assessment of SAT/ACT scores and incorporated more “historic data for a few of the other ranking indicators.” This suggests that the data used by U.S. News was outdated and did not necessarily reflect the current academic caliber of universities.
Secondly, the U.S. News’ ranking criteria has long been mired in controversies. Journalists, such as Max Kutner, and some education websites have already pointed out that universities can strategically increase their rankings by using a certain set of criteria. Years ago, Northeastern University was a little-known regional commuter school. According to the Boston Globe, to attract better students and more donations, Northeastern looked into the ranking formula and manipulated criteria to improve the university’s overall ranking. As a result, Northeastern’s ranking rose from No. 162 in the 1990s to No. 98 in 2006. The incident shows that the system can be gamed and, therefore, questions the authority and validity of the rankings.
A crucial part of the U.S. News ranking formula pertains to reputations, which make up 20% of the total score. The College Solution website pointed out that U.S. News uses a rather subjective method to calculate reputation. The organization invites three administrations from schools in the national university category to rate other schools from one to five. However, the evaluation process’ design itself is highly biased, and not all university administrators respond to the survey, making the final result even more inaccurate.
Ultimately, the U.S. News rankings focus on the academic performance of universities but ignore students’ quality of life on campus. According to an article published by the Daily Trojan, USC reached a 50-50 gender ratio in the Viterbi School of Engineering, as well as Marshall School of Business. Gender parity encourages diversity in STEM, business and other male dominated fields. Ultimately, this provides a nontoxic environment to female students and enhances their university experience, which can lead to a more successful career route. 
Apart from the gender ratio, the small student-faculty ratio at USC also benefits students. Universities such as UCLA have an 18:1 student-faculty ratio, while USC’s is 9:1. This means that USC students have smaller-sized classes and, therefore, more individualized attention from faculty. This provides them with better learning experiences overall.
The regular change of U.S. News’ formula makes college rankings fluctuate every year. The result only speaks for the perspective of one specific institution, and it would be arbitrary to judge a school based on it. USC ranked No. 14 in the country according to 2021 QS World University Rankings: USA, and came in at No. 16 in Niche’s 2022 Best Colleges in America. These statistics, once again, show that ranking is a subjective process and certainly does not reflect the real worth of the University.
Overall, students should not let rankings affect their impression of USC. They should actively engage with their life on campus and fully immerse themselves in their college experience. Instead of relying on rankings, students can discover and determine the value of their university themselves.
