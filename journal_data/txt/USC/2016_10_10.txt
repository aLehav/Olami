Perhaps we don’t see it much in Southern California, but this is the time of year when the cool air rolls in and the leaves begin to change. For a certain group of sports fans, this change of weather means one thing: the MLB postseason. 
I love October baseball. It’s not my favorite playoffs of the professional sports — the NHL holds that spot — but when October rolls around, I’m always excited for baseball playoffs, regardless of if I have a team in contention or not. 
There’s just something about the magic of October baseball that I really love. Some of my most memorable sports moments happened in October. 
I’ve gotten to see the Red Sox win the World Series three times in my life. While all wins are great, the 2013 win sticks out to me the most. I remember Game 6 at Fenway Park the most. John Lackey took the mound after losing Game 2, also at Fenway. The Red Sox knocked in six runs, three each in innings three and four. At this point, sitting on my couch at home, I was on top of the world. The Red Sox were set to win their third World Series in 10 years. The Cardinals picked up a run in the seventh, but I wasn’t worried. I could just feel that the Red Sox were going to win. 
Koji Uehara came in as the closer. When he walked out, I knew the Red Sox were finally going to clinch the World Series at Fenway — something that hadn’t happened in 95 years. 
Uehara struck out Matt Carpenter to win it all. Watching the team and the fans at Fenway celebrate, I jumped off the couch, just as happy as all of them. I wanted more than anything to be there that day. Going to Fenway had been my dream since I was about 7 or 8. I finally got to live out that dream this past May. While at Fenway, I got to see all of the team’s World Series memorabilia. Getting to see everything from the 2013 World Series was beyond cool. 
To top the victory off, David Ortiz was named the World Series MVP. I was so excited for him that I cried during the presentation of his award and his interview. It was a pretty amazing Wednesday.
The second most memorable memory I have is Game 2 of the 2015 National League Division Series. My friend Sam and I sat atop Dodgers Stadium excited to watch Zack Greinke pitch. It was an eventful game, to say the least. The Mets knocked in two early, which brought down our spirits just a bit, but then the Dodgers knocked in one a inning or so later. 
The Dodgers were down 2-1 in the bottom of the seventh when one of the biggest things to come out the this series happened. With one out, Chase Utley slid into second, collided with Ruben Tejada, and broke his leg. At first, everyone in Dodgers was screaming and cheering that Utley was called safe. It wasn’t until Tejada didn’t get up that everyone realized something was wrong. A silence more or less fell through the stadium as they played replay after replay on the big screen — Tejada still hadn’t gotten up. It felt like forever until they finally brought the stretcher out. Everyone clapped as Tejada was strapped on and taken off the field. 
The Dodgers went on to score four runs in that inning, winning the game 5-2. After the first run, the stadium was rocking. It continued to get louder and louder with each run the Dodgers scored. That was some of the most fun I’ve ever had at a sporting event.
Even though the Dodgers ended up losing the series, it was still a great game and atmosphere to take part in. The Dodgers haven’t won a World Series in my lifetime, but every year when October rolls around and the boys in blue are playing, part of me hangs onto the hope that it’ll finally be the year. So far, it’s never been the year, but maybe this year will be different. 
To me, October baseball is the best kind of baseball. There’s a type of magic around it that keeps me coming back year after year. Maybe it’s the fact that the MLB season has 162 games that make October so special. There are stretches of the baseball season that don’t seem to matter. With so many games, baseball feels long and tedious, but that’s not the case in October. Crazy and exciting things always seem to happen in the postseason. 
This year’s playoff is nothing short of expectations. The Cubs are looking to break their 107-year curse. The Indians are looking to win their first championship since 1948. The Dodgers are trying to “Win for Vin” and get their first title since 1988. 
Whoever ends up winning, it’ll be an exciting, magical journey through October, and I couldn’t be more excited to watch.

Truth, healing and love: three words Leo Xia, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, used to describe his music.
“Truth, for me, is learning a lot about Asian American history and social justice. It’s about me learning about how I exist with my own history,” Xia said. 
Xia’s music conveys themes of social justice, stereotypes toward those of the Asian American heritage and the personal struggle that Asians encounter when integrating into American society. 
Music, to Xia, represents the range of emotions he has experienced in his life. His featured title tracks on Spotify, “Split Down the Middle” and “Yellow,” touch on topics closest to his heart and heritage. 
“For “Yellow,” it was learning about the Chinese Massacre of 1871,” Xia said. 
He reflected on how these historical and cultural events affect his existence and how he has been prompted to address that in his music. 
Though his featured tracks focus on the topic of being Asian American, Xia’s music can speak to a wider audience on topics like love and jealousy. In fact, one of Xia’s first self-composed works was a love song in 8th grade to his girlfriend. 
Now, Xia is preparing to release his first six-track EP titled Hyphenated in the coming spring.
“We’re so starved of Asian artists speaking out artistically,” Xia said about his path as a singer-songwriter. 
He hopes that his talent, not only his voice for social justice, will carry him far in his music career.
Junior year was when Xia’s music career finally took off and he began to see a future with music, playing at night markets and smaller gigs. He began to perform at other universities, usually for Asian organizations, and landed a gig in Little Tokyo that connected him to a production company. 
Xia is looking forward to his EP release, which will set the stage for his post graduate future. 
“First off, I plan to travel with friends and hopefully book a fall tour after I graduate around the U.S. with different college organizations, Asian organizations and maybe conferences,” he said. 
Meanwhile, his music video for “Split Down the Middle” is currently in the works, and Xia has been using his remaining time in school to focus on his music career. Besides music, he is involved with Asian Pacific American Student Services and dances for Chaotic 3, which has formed out of USC’s Chinese American Student Association. 
“I want to help people in the way I’ve been helped,” Xia said, in regard to his involvements with various Asian organizations and nonprofits. 
He’s passionate about sharing his unique experience as an Asian American. He was raised as a young boy in San Francisco, spent his primary education in Beijing and returned to the United States for college. 
“I’m kind of like a third culture kid,” Xia said. 
Xia hopes to use his music to not only share experiences, but create empathy and understanding from those outside the Asian American community. He hopes to spread messages of social justice in his music and combine it with elements of love and healing. 
Xia’s funding for his debut project, Hyphenated, can be found on Kickstarter. His music can also be found on Spotify, iTunes, Amazon and Google Play.

I get homesick easily. I’m the type of person who sees something insignificant, like a brown leaf, and thinks back to every memory I have ever had with a brown leaf. These memories are usually related to growing up in Michigan. And while California’s weather does not change drastically, there are still plenty of brown leaves around, which means homesickness seems like a chronic illness to me during the fall.
To help with my homesickness, I listen to some local artists from Michigan to remind me of the sounds I heard while I was growing up. While every city has its local artists, there are some who unfortunately fall through the cracks and don’t get the recognition they deserve. Hipsters will be the first to brag about these artists you “probably haven’t heard of” like it’s their claim to fame. While Detroit has plenty of these artists, my favorite is, without a doubt, a group called Slum Village.
Slum Village started out as an unknown, underground rap group that nobody, save for a few hip musicians and artists, could tell you about. However, like most groups, one chance encounter led to another — mostly in part to their producer — and they finally got a sweet record deal. After stirring some commotion with their first album, Slum Village finally hit their stride with their second and best album, Fantastic, Vol. 2. 
For me, this album has one of the key sounds that represent the culture and music scene of Detroit. Every time I listen to this album, it puts me back in the city. It puts me back in a car going down Woodward Avenue and seeing the cityscape of Detroit, and how there’s a clear divide between the more commercial sections and the sections that seemed to be forgotten about. It puts me back on the sidewalk of the downtown area, walking by the Fillmore and trying to choose from the myriad of local restaurants to eat at for the night with my friends.
Lowkey beats with a subtle, yet smooth baseline reinvented the head bump. Soulful claps on the twos and fours sounded like they were recorded in a Baptist church in the heart of the city. Rhymes jumped between being playful and conscious — these were all indicators of Slum Village’s self-aware but fun attitude. These elements are what make up the overall sound of Fantastic, Vol. 2, the quintessential album from this little known Motor City group.
In the city where Motown was born, it’s no surprise that R&B and soul are among the most popular styles in the Detroit music scene, and as time went on, it made sense that the city’s musicians were able to incorporate aspects of the two genres into the more mainstream direction music was going into: hip-hop and rap.
Songs like “Climax,” “Tell Me,” “Untitled/Fantastic” and the classic “Fall In Love” are all simply smooth as butter. The lyrics, truth be told, aren’t the most prolific, but Baatin, Jay Dee and T3 have voices that were made for these beats. The Midwest didn’t have too much to show for in the hip-hop scene at the time (except for everyone’s favorite bleach-blond rapper), but these three showed what one aspect of Detroit sounded like.
Every song on this album has a heavy-R&B and soul influence. “I Don’t Know” even features bits of a James Brown’s “Make it Funky.” Sound bits from the Brown jump into the rappers’ verses to finish out what they were saying and create an effect that sounds like James Brown is throwing in ad-libs with the group live in the studio.
It’s a fun song that contributes to a cool, calm and collected album. It’s perfect to listen to when you’re strolling around in the Motor City, providing a backdrop to the gorgeous urban landscape that’s humble but homey. Whenever I put this album on and listen to its soothing beats, it always feels like I’m listening to the heartbeat of the cities I grew up around. It’s one of those albums that truly makes me believe in the therapeutic aspect of music. It can take my blues and turn them into happy memories, which were never in short supply in Detroit during October.
I always consider this to be one of the perfect Detroit albums because of the amount of soul that you can feel from a group that doesn’t have the flash or wide appeal of other rap groups. Last week, I touched on The Slim Shady LP and how its dark humor reflects the ability of the city to rise above its problems. This album, on the other hand, represents Detroit in its natural state. To outsiders, it might look raw and unrefined, but give it a closer look and it will surprise you with the beauty it puts forward. It foregoes the extra to focus on the basics, and sometimes, that’s all you need.

The Aeneid Theatre Company kicked off their second season last Thursday with a production of Equus, which ran until Sunday. Written by Peter Shaffer, the 1973 drama describes the case of a child psychiatrist attempting to unravel the psychological underpinnings of a teenager’s religious and sexual obsession with horses. Directed by Ryan David McRee and starring Shrey Bhargava as psychiatrist Martin Dysart and Alexander Pires as teenage patient Alan Strang, Equus is an ambitious but somewhat derivative play that was elevated by McRee’s clever direction, a talented cast of theatre majors and many moments of unforgettably surreal imagery. The play was a success for Aeneid, a student theatre company at USC devoted to independently producing high quality non-musical plays at USC.
Equus’s story is unconventional and heavy, but the actors, especially leads Bhargava and Pires, more than meet the challenge. The play was an indisputable triumph for its performers, who displayed the maturity and faith in their director’s vision that is required to bring such material to life. Because the actors took the story about a boy with a fetish for horses seriously — because they flung themselves into whinnying like horses with full abandon, because they bravely exposed themselves onstage to act out a sex scene in a barn — the audience took the play seriously as well and became engrossed. The commitment of the actors was also displayed through their incredible endurance. For the play’s entire two-and-a-half hour duration, most of the actors remained onstage.
“[It was] absolutely tiring, but also incredibly energizing,” Bhargava said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Acting is all about being present, and this was a whole new challenge for me. Being onstage for two and half hours straight forced me to really live as Martin Dysart, and that was difficult but also very rewarding.”
Equus was also a showcase for the considerable directing talents of McRee, who deftly utilized all of the tools in his arsenal to build up the play’s unsettling atmosphere. Staunchly minimalistic in his vision, the director severely limited the number of props on set in favor of pantomime; he also avoided scene changes altogether by instead directing his actors to move the existing furniture and create new settings themselves.
 The result was an eerie production that conspicuously manipulated space and time in a way that allowed the lighting to dramatically come to the forefront. Equus’s imagery was truly unforgettable, and one particular scene when the stage was lit up with red and the actors charged around in horse masks was surreal, nightmarish and tremendously effective.
Unfortunately, although the execution of Equus was stellar, the script itself was rather flawed. Shaffer was undeniably ambitious, but the playwright’s attempt to cover multiple multifaceted topics such as religion, politics, sexuality and normalcy resulted in an end product that was muddled and often mired in pretension. With its inability to synthesize and fully explore its various topics, Equus ended up feeling more like a mishmash of better works, such as A Clockwork Orange, than an original piece with something unique and important to impart. The play also had an unfortunate exploitative tendency of fetishizing mental illness, and its portrayal of Strang’s psychological issues as a vessel to reach divine joy and passion had disturbing implications.
Muddled themes and pretensions aside, however, Equus truly showcased the various talents of the Aeneid Theatre. The acting was superb, the directing effective and the imagery absolutely unforgettable. Ultimately, Equus was an entertaining and compelling psychological thriller that transported its viewers into another world of dark, surreal imagery.
“Incredibly intriguing, Equus just challenges your imagination on a whole new level,” Bhargava said.

Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold takes the snap and rolls out as the pass rush closes in. He cuts upfield, finds daylight and breaks toward the end zone. But Darnold loses the ball as he dives for the goal line, killing the Trojans’ drive at the one-yard line.
That was how USC’s first possession ended in Saturday’s game against Colorado. The Trojans eventually battled to a 21-17 victory over the Buffaloes, but they had to overcome four turnovers on the way — three from Darnold, who lost two fumbles and threw an interception. Only an excellent defensive performance allowed USC to drive down the field and score the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter. When the Trojan offense opened the second half with turnovers on their first three possessions, the Buffaloes managed just a single touchdown thanks to a quickly forced three-and-out and an acrobatic interception from junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson.
To be sure, the Trojans didn’t have a poor offensive game. They racked up a season-best 539 total yards on offense, Darnold passed for a career-high 358 and junior wideout JuJu Smith-Schuster notched more than 100 receiving yards for the second straight week. Darnold even miraculously spun a fumble into a touchdown, scrambling in the red zone before finding sophomore tight end Tyler Petite near the pylon.
“He’s able to make things happen that wouldn’t be available [for other players],” Petite said of his quarterback after catching two scores on Saturday. “He’s special.”
And for that reason, head coach Clay Helton was hesitant to rein in his dynamic signal caller, despite Darnold losing the ball on several occasions.
“When you have a kid with this instinct and creative ability, I don’t think you handcuff him,” Helton said. “I told him, ‘Drive it like you stole it.’ You play the game with no fear, and he does.”
It’s easy to understand Helton’s sentiment, as USC has been a rejuvenated team since the 19-year-old replaced redshirt junior Max Browne under center. The Trojans have suddenly become fumble-prone, however, capping the offense’s potential. The team  hasn’t exactly been a hallmark of ball security all season, but since Darnold’s first start against Utah, USC has fumbled 10 times in three games, losing six. Darnold is responsible for four of them (three lost), but two other Trojans — Jackson and senior tailback Justin Davis — have also put the ball on the ground multiple times.
“As an offense, you’re not going to win a ton of games turning the ball over four times,” Darnold said. “It’s something we have to keep working on in practice.”
Indeed, USC might need to correct the issue if the team wants a win at Arizona. The Wildcats have forced six fumbles this season, recovering four, and have five interceptions as a team—although they forced two-thirds of their turnovers this year in a single game against Grambling State. You have to go back a decade, to a 20-3 Trojan victory in 2006, to find the last contest between USC and Arizona that ended with a two-possession winning margin. The Trojans upset the No. 10 Wildcats during their most recent visit to Tucson in 2014, but it was only thanks to a shanked field goal that would have put Arizona ahead with seconds left to play.
In a game that could very well go down to the wire, another afternoon like last Saturday could cost USC the game and the season, which can hardly withstand another loss with the Trojans’ middling 3-3 record and a brutal end-of-season schedule on tap. Fortunately, Darnold isn’t dwelling on any mistakes, and he isn’t lacking in confidence.
“No matter what anyone else thinks, you just have to control what you can control. You can’t control the past. You just have to look ahead,” he said. “In the end, you just have to look ahead and take it play after play.”
That’s exactly the attitude a head coach wants his starter to have as he encourages his team to have a “playoff mentality.” Helton said every week would be treated like a championship game from here on out, but as long as Darnold was continuing to progress, Helton won’t hesitate to let the redshirt freshman go through his growing pains.
“There will be mistakes … but he’s one of those guys that you don’t make a robot,” Helton said. “I’m very proud of where he’s at. He’s not a finished product by any means, but he’s helping us win football games.”
After all, in a playoff run, that’s all that matters.

If it weren’t for junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson’s unbelievably gymnastic interception and senior wide receiver Darreus Rodgers’ over-the-back sensation of a catch, the play of the game just might have come in the second quarter of Saturday’s win against Colorado.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold muffed a snap and scrambled backwards to scoop the ball off the ground. He ran backwards toward his left sideline, then turned around and sprinted the other way, three Colorado players chasing after him.
In the half-second before a sack came, he cocked his arm back and rifled a throw to wide-open sophomore tight end Tyler Petite. Petite turned, sprinted and dove for the end zone, turning a catastrophe of a play into another six points for the Trojans. 
“I heard the crowd, and I wasn’t even sure what was happening,” Petite said. “But when I turned and looked at [Darnold], I knew that second that he was going to throw to me and I was ready for it.”
In a game riddled with fumbles and turnovers, Sunday’s game against Colorado was a breakout moment for a small group of offensive players — the tight ends. Petite caught two passes for two touchdowns, and Daniel Imatorbhebhe roped in 45 receiving yards for one touchdown. 
Although they made their presence known on Sunday, statistics wouldn’t necessarily point to the tight end corps as the most stand-out section of the team. This season, Petite, McNamara and Imatorbhebhe combined have notched barely more than half the yardage of junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, posting 241 yards against the receiver’s 433 yards.
But that’s the nature of the position.
As bigger and bulkier players, tight ends block as often — if not more — than they receive the ball, operating as a hybrid between an offensive tackle and a wide receiver. Especially with talented players such as senior running back Justin Davis in the backfield, these players are expected to bulldoze through edge rushers to create seams for a back to run through.
This means that tight ends are often forgotten in college ball, stuck in a position of blocking for talented running backs or holding the line while a quarterback finds his receiver. This happened just last season — Petite notched 145 yards for one touchdown, and McNamara roped in 83 yards for four.
But this season, Petite has already surpassed his yardage from last season through his first six games, while adding another touchdown. The reason? It might come from the quarterback switch. Darnold is mobile, skilled at scrambling when his pocket collapses as well as quickly dumping the ball to whoever is available. And often that player is a tight end.
“[Darnold] is making good decisions,” Helton said. “He’s distributing the ball to everybody and going through progressions and reading the entire field.”
Although they haven’t seen much action until the last few games, the tight end corps has been recognized as an experienced, veteran section for the Trojans. McNamara is a senior, who started last year after transferring from Oklahoma. Petite was a back-up as a true freshman who is now expected to step up, and Imatorbhebhe entered the seasons with high expectations on his shoulders after transferring from Florida and redshirting his first season.
They might not post the same yardage as a receiver or a running back, but these three players could be vital to a Darnold-run offense. By providing an outlet pass when the offense breaks down and a more physical mid-range passing option, the tight end corps will create a more balanced attack for the Trojans looking forward.
“It’s always good to see the tight ends getting into the end zone, getting points on the board,” Petite said. “We want … as a team to get the win however is necessary. But it’s always good to see the tight ends as a group getting the recognition they deserve.”

Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton faced off for the second time on national television Sunday evening. Like many before it, Sunday’s presidential debate was a veritable showcase of oratorical strategies. Red herrings, ad hominem attacks, conflation of meaning — you name the rhetorical device, it was used by both candidates.
But you knew that already.
Those strategies, while showy, do not reflect substance. What is more telling than pointed quips and prepared taglines is the way that both candidates presented themselves to voters. At this point, Trump and Clinton are vying for undecided citizens across the country, individuals like those who were at the town-hall style debate and had the opportunity to ask the candidates critically important questions. Their questions, though, were the ones that the candidates often did their best not to answer.
If you have settled on Trump or Clinton already, as many Americans have, that is great. You have found a candidate who you feel represents you accurately enough to secure your vote. I applaud your conviction and I wish you much success in November. However, the decided voter is not to be addressed here.
This feature will now directly address the uncertain millennial voter. If there is something to be gleaned from this debate for you, it is this: Neither candidate seems to have you specifically in mind when they go to their campaign’s drawing board. One or the other may look like you, talk like you, appear to share your opinions on any number of issues, but from their presentation on Sunday, neither is trying to faithfully represent you. Clinton wants to protect marriage equality and a woman’s right to choose. For a liberal millennial, these are important issues, but certainly not ones unique to them. Trump desires a return to law and order and to smash ISIS. For a conservative millennial, the same commentary applies. Absent from the debate was a detailed discussion of the issues that are of the highest importance to millennial American voters across the board: job opportunities for students who just earned their degrees, food and water accessibility and the availability and affordability of education.
Certainly, some of these topics were touched upon — tangentially — in the course of the debate. In her opening statement, Clinton said that one of her “big goals” was to “[make] sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college, making it affordable, and so much else.” That was the only time college was referenced during the debate. For his part, Trump also touched on an issue important to millennials: as a part of his response to a question about tax policy, Trump expressed his belief that America’s GDP growth rate is too low. Jobs were only ever discussed by both candidates in sweeping generalities, and never with reference to the nearly 2.8 million expected college graduates who will be seeking jobs the year that the new president is sworn in. This was as close as the candidates got to discussing issues that are important and common to millennials from all over the political spectrum.
Of course, the candidates had big things to say in other, more general areas. Trump wants to lower taxes and simultaneously “fix” inner cities for African Americans and Latinos. He wants to crush ISIS using whatever means necessary and concurrently ignore the humanitarian crisis in Syria. He believes that he will be able to bring back manufacturing and energy jobs through his tax cuts and that these jobs will produce enough revenue to pay off the current $590 billion federal budget deficit. How unrealistic this scheme is has never appeared to cross his mind. Clinton, for her part, also had her fair share of generalities and vague desires. When pressed for more specifics, on more than one occasion, Clinton referred to her website rather than offering a succinct, persuasive summary of her plans. Indeed, Clinton made appeals to answer audience questions only when she was being grilled, again, over her email server controversy. When the time came to answer those questions, she would respond with poise, but often without compelling substance. Both candidates failed to explain why their equally vague plans were better. They managed only to show that there were problems with the other’s. What each wants to do in the Oval Office is on the table now — how they intend to go about doing it is still obscure.
Both candidates also seem to forget that there are limits on the power of the president in American democracy. Under our constitution, the president must faithfully execute the laws, but is not the arbiter of all things the government can do. One shouldn’t expect the president to single-handedly solve every problem, or even most problems, that plague society. Laws are for Congress to make, not the president. The American republic is complex, and representative democracy is slow-working. It was designed to be this way for good reason. However, presidential debates are not as popular as they are for reminding voters that the president can only do so much, that the powers of the executive are limited in our democracy. Televised presidential debates are overwhelmingly popular because they present an opportunity for a candidate to reach out to and court voters who have not yet decided who to vote for.
Yet, if the audience at Washington University was hoping for a nuanced discussion of policy ― or even just answers to questions that would help them decide who to cast their vote for they were likely disappointed. Sunday’s spectacle was not so much a contest of persuasive policy as it was, sadly, a contest of personality. Viewers of the debate witnessed an abandonment of decorum in favor of bullish behavior on both sides. And though it is true that personality influences presentation, policy solves problems.
While the candidates were engaged in a heated discussion about each other, both missed an opportunity to explain to millennials that their interests are important. Both candidates missed an opportunity to illustrate how they plan to address millennial issues with detailed and practical policy recommendations. Doing so would have only taken up a small portion of the debate, but, clearly, decade-old personal scandals on both sides are of far greater national importance. This left the undecided millennial no better off after the debate than before.
What we can be certain of, then, is this: Neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump appears to be making the concerns of the 78 million millennials in this country a priority, and neither cares specifically about your vote. Yet.

Well written piece. However, you display the same chronic naïveté as that of your target audience: the same overly idealistic, have-never-paid-the-rent kind of whiney, unhelpful observation everyone in their mid-20s with an obnoxious opinion seems to make. In fact, like your article states, you know what we already know? That this is already the fourth-some article about Trump/Clinton personality politics just in this paper and the thousandth one from just this week all across America. You provide well-written commentary but definitely nothing original. What you say is true but so is 1+1=2. No one could really disagree with what you say. Which is why, if not for your fine writing, this article makes for such a boring read.

This past weekend was full of warm welcomes for parents and students across campus. With a day full of tailgating on Saturday and a concert delivered by the legendary Bangles, it’s no doubt that parents reconnected with their golden years. When I told my mom about the Bangles coming out to play a show, she got really excited – that is, until we both realized we forgot to register her to come. Not only was my mom bummed about missing the Bangles, she was also bummed about missing weekend one of “Oldmanchella.” Sorry, Mom!
Nonetheless, it was a good weekend with my parents, and in honor of the many parents who came to visit USC this weekend, I decided it would be appropriate to make a playlist of all the old jams our moms and dads used to listen to. This one’s for you, Mom and Dad!

I’m going to be honest: until recently, I’d always felt somewhat uncomfortable with the word “feminism.”
As someone who’s pretty outspoken about the subtle and not-so-subtle inequities between men and women in society, I’d feel guilty when I found myself cringing every time someone asked me if I was a feminist and I’d answer proudly, but almost defensively, that yes, I was. But I’d never stopped to ask the question — why? Why was I so uncomfortable with the word as a form of identification? By formal definition, feminism at its very core is nothing more than the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. Sounds pretty simple, right?
Part of it has to do with the stigma surrounding the word “feminist”, and the fact that I always felt as if I was trying to prove its stereotype of a radical man-hater wrong. I’ve more than once had to reassure people that despite the stereotype, I was a “chill” feminist and not a misandrist at all. Even after widespread media campaigns to de-stigmatize feminism by high-profile speakers like Emma Watson, who spearheads the United Nations HeForShe movement (encouraging women AND men to take up the mantle of “feminist”), it still has the connotation of pitting women against men, and understandably so. I think it’s hard to deny that there is a resentment by feminists towards the institutionalized sexism that is perpetuated by the apathy of men in power, who we feel benefit from a system that rewards simply for being a certain gender. In a culture that encourages “going with the flow,” when being laid-back means not making a fuss about problems that can’t necessarily be solved easily, vocalizing our frustration towards the patriarchal status quo can be seen as being “high-maintenance” or “uptight.” And nobody, least of all me, wants to come off that way. 
Another aspect is that the feminist issues that matter to me seem to come from such a place of privilege, which strikes a chord of guilt within me. I myself am a privileged, upper-middle class American citizen who is able to attend one of the most expensive schools in the nation. Equating my dissatisfaction regarding the lack of women in leadership positions in business and tech, to the much more serious struggles that women from a wide spectrum of different races, nationalities, and socioeconomic backgrounds may have, can seem unrelatable and unreasonable. Feminism is such a relative ideology that varies so much within every individual’s experiences and frame of reference that my feminism can feel so trivial when I compare it to a woman who is fighting to be granted fundamental human rights and a basic level of respect, whether it be in America or a different country altogether. It’s becoming increasingly challenging to navigate the nuances of a multidimensional world where intersectionality, or how a certain group of women’s unique experience with gender inequality may be different from another’s, is being given much more consideration than before. But maybe that’s the beauty of it — that no matter where we come from, or what our backgrounds may be, we are all ultimately fighting for the same cause. 
I understand that the term “feminism” can seem alienating. Whenever you define something as an “-ism,” you’re framing it as a theory, with a set of beliefs or a doctrine that you may stand for or against. It makes some people, especially men, tune out the real message of feminism — that despite decades of sluggish progress, there is still so much to be done in order to achieve gender equality in America and worldwide. 
To me, advocating for women’s rights holds the same logic as advocating for the Black Lives Matter movement. To quote Trevor Noah of the Daily Show, “You know, the hardest part of having a conversation…in America [is that] it always feels like if you take a stand for something, you automatically are against something else.” But by saying that women’s rights matter, or that black lives matter, we’re not saying that anyone’s rights or lives matter less than others. All we’re doing is recognizing that certain groups of privilege have rights that are much less in danger than those of others, and that there is a need to prioritize making sure that we’re doing what we can to lessen the gap. 
I want to end the misconception that feminism is meant to exclude anyone who is not a woman. That’s not the point, and we don’t want it to be; in fact, that would defeat our entire purpose. That’s why the UN is encouraging men to be a part of the conversation through HeForShe, and trying to make it more accessible and engaging for everyone — because equality can’t be achieved when only 50% of the world population cares about the cause. The bottom line is: feminism is a universal, unifying ideology that bands together everyone who believes in women’s equality from all walks of life, all over the globe.

Feminism is cancer.   So is Black Lives Matter.   Let Milo help you with the applied analytics and stop lying about some silly unifying equality ideology or you’ll be laughed out of the park.
