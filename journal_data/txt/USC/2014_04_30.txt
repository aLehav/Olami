Reed Semcken, a senior majoring in business administration, never expected to line up with approximately 36,000 other runners for a marathon, and he certainly never expected to do so tethered to another runner, but that’s exactly what happened at the Boston Marathon earlier this month.
Just keep running · Adrian Broca (left), a blind runner, and Reed Semcken (right), a senior majoring in business administration, pose for a picture after the 2014 Boston Marathon, which was held on Monday, April 21. – Photo courtesy of Reed Semcken
 
Even though Semcken’s parents both run marathons, he had never been much of a runner himself. This year, however, he made a New Year’s Resolution to run the L.A. Marathon, and it led him on an unconventional journey to run in Boston shortly after.
Semcken began training in early January for the March 9 Los Angeles race but admitted that there was not much structure to his training regimen.
“I just went out and ran until I got tired,” Semcken said.
Nineteen days before the race, however, Semcken realized that he could run in honor of his uncle, who has acute myeloid lymphoma. In those last 19 days before the race, Semcken raised almost $8,000 for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, while at the same time doubling down on his training.
“I got a team and a coach, and that gave me more support and knowledge going into the marathon,” Semcken said.
Though he had originally only been shooting for a marathon time of three hours, 40 minutes, Semcken ended up finishing the race in three hours, five minutes, six seconds. To qualify for the Boston Marathon, runners are required to finish a marathon in three hours, five minutes or less.
“My dad lives along the marathon route, so he got me to stop and take a Christmas card picture along the route,” Semcken said.
He noted that the 15 or so seconds it took to snap the photo cost him his Boston Marathon eligibility.
“My dad was devastated,” Semcken said. “In his frantic state, he started calling everybody from the Boston Marathon that he could.”
When Semcken’s father finally heard back from Boston Marathon officials, he learned that the 2014 race was full, but that Semcken could participate as a guide for a blind runner.
Semcken was paired with Adrian Broca, a Santa Monica resident and a two-time winner of the Boston Marathon Visually Impaired Division. Like Semcken, Broca had never been much of a runner growing up. When he was 18, however, he began to lose his eyesight and began running as a way to cope with this new disability.
“Seeing what running meant to [Broca] added so much excitement and so much anxiety -— if I got hurt or if I cramped on the route, his marathon was over,” Semcken said.
Semcken was one of four guides, each of whom ran with Broca for 10 kilometers of the marathon.
Running as a guide obviously changed some aspects of the running experience, Semcken noted.
“[Broca] literally takes a shoelace, and I take the front of the shoelace and he takes the back,” Semcken said. “It’s very awkward, especially for a marathon, because you’re twice as wide and twice as long.”
When running a marathon, size matters, especially at the beginning of the race. Semcken ran the first 10 kilometers of the marathon with Broca.
“The other three runners had guided before, and they all said they’d take any 10K but the first 10K,” Semcken said.
Though Semcken didn’t immediately understand the preference of the other guides, he definitely understood on the day of the marathon.
“You’re guiding a blind runner through 36,000 people — at the start of any marathon that’s where the crowd is,” Semcken said.
Nonetheless, Semcken and Broca managed to navigate through the crowd of runners for the first 10K of the race.
Semcken had been disappointed to learn upon arriving in Boston that guides were no longer permitted to run the whole marathon.
“It was devastating to me,” Semcken said. “I’d flown out to Boston and I’d been training for months.”
But at the end of his 10K shift, Semcken was met with unexpected leniency.
“There’s a police officer that’s supposed to intercept me, and he just said, go on man, keep running,” Semcken said.
Semcken was thrilled to get to run the rest of the race, though rules prevented him from running with Broca. The two kept a similar pace throughout the race, however, with Broca finishing at two hours and 58 minutes and Semcken finishing at two hours and 59 minutes.
“I got to be there with [Broca] at the finish line,” Semcken said. “I don’t want to call it life-changing and be dramatic, but it was an incredible experience … Every marathon that [Broca] runs is an unbelievable struggle, as he’s running in complete darkness.”
Semcken said he was just one of the many who had a remarkable experience at the marathon, especially in light of last year’s tragedy.
“Every person that I told I was doing the marathon had a story to tell about it,” he said. “It was a very humbling experience to participate in an event that has such significance to so many people, especially the year after such a huge tragedy.”

Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Vice Dean for Academic Programs Steven Lamy announced this past week that the Master of Professional Writing program, which was slated to shut its doors in May of 2016, will find a new home at the Vermont College of Fine Arts.
Last November, Dornsife Dean Steve Kay informed MPW Program Director Brighde Mullins that the program would no longer be accepting incoming students and would graduate its last class in May 2016 due to a necessary “business decision.”
Now, current MPW students will have the option to either finish their degree at USC by May 2016 or receive full transfer credits from the MPW program at USC in order to complete any remaining graduation requirements to obtain a master of fine arts degree in writing from VCFA. Students will also have the third option of completing an expedited MFA degree at VCFA, if accepted into the program.
Current MPW instructor Trinie Dalton, who has also been an instructor in the MFA program at VCFA, will lead the new writing program in Vermont.
“They’re both programs I’ve felt at home in,” Dalton said. “While I’ll be directing the new full-residential program at VCFA, I still expect the experiences to be very similar in regards to high-quality student work, and passionate faculty members who are talented teachers as well as grand successes in their fields.”
Despite Dalton’s enthusiasm for the new program, students are now faced with the difficult decision of potentially choosing to relocate across the country to complete their degree.
Student Doug Greco said one of the benefits of the MPW program at USC was that the program offered students up to five years to complete the degree. Greco, who entered the program in 2013, valued MPW’s flexibility in allowing him until 2018 to graduate. After it was announced that the program would close in 2016, he made the decision to continue full-time in an effort to finish his degree by the  deadline. Greco is now faced with the decision of whether he will continue as a full-time student to finish his degree at USC, or relocate to Vermont to finish his degree at VFCA.
“The reason I wanted more time to complete my degree [at USC] was so I could work full time here in L.A., so I would hope there would be some option for students who chose to do that route that would be able to continue to live in L.A.,” Greco said.
Though Greco would have preferred the program stay at USC, he said that moving the program to VCFA seems to be the best choice possible given the situation.
“I think the Vermont program is a great opportunity … The spirit of what we’ve heard so far is that they seem to be pretty flexible, and especially since it’s a smaller school they have a broad perspective on flexibility,” he said.
Additionally, VCFA is offering MPW alumni the choice of affiliating with their program. According to Lamy’s statement, MPW alumni can choose to “informally affiliate with either the USC MPW program or with VCFA’s graduate writing program, or with both.”
Some alumni, however, are concerned and confused about the different affiliation options. Lynda Rivers, who graduated from the MPW program in 2007, said she fears the program might not have as much weight with potential employers if there are no longer any USC MPW professors to support the alumni.
“It’s all shocking and confusing, and I don’t think anyone understands what it means,” Rivers said. “I’m angry and bitter that none of this was done with discussion … It just happened and now these poor students have a big decision to make.”
Furthermore, Rivers said she has been very disappointed with the way USC has treated alumni throughout the process of cancelling and then relocating the program. Rather, she has been much more impressed with VCFA’s welcoming attitude and how they have reached out to alumni in a positive and respectful way.
“We were sent a formal letter from Dean Lamy, and it referred to numerous topics but did not go into detail,” Rivers said. “Instead of taking time to understand and develop what they should say to alumni, they just sent out kind of a half-a– letter … they don’t understand we have invested a lot of time and money into MPW, and it’s very clear to us they want to wash their hands of us and be done, or at least that’s how they made us feel.”
For VCFA President Thomas Greene, it is very important that USC MPW students and alumni feel welcomed into the VCFA program.
“We want to give alumni [an]  opportunity to be in touch with us as this program continues to grown and evolve and live,” Greene said.
Through affiliating with the VCFA program, MPW alumni will receive invitations to alumni events, be included in all alumni communications, receive an optional vcfa.edu e-mail address, have the opportunity to participate in postgraduate conferences and network with VCFA alumni from other programs.
“Our hope to is to build on the strength of both institutions,” Greene said. “I think when you look at faculty in this program it is a mix some folks from USC and some folks from Vermont it combines the best of both worlds.”

On Wednesday night, the School of Cinematic Arts in conjunction with Wicked Pictures and Takedown Piracy hosted a panel called “The Piracy of Sex: A Conversation with Jessica Drake and Nate Glass,” hosted by David Lerner, an adjunct faculty at SCA.
Arr-rated · jessica drake, contract performer, director and producer of Wicked Pictures, spoke on the growth of digital piracy during Wednesday evening’s event. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Jessica Drake is a sex educator and performer, writer and director for Wicked Pictures, a pornographic film studio headquartered in nearby Canoga Park. Nate Glass is the founder of Takedown Piracy, an anti-piracy service that works to prevent pirating of films on digital media, including pornographic films as well as mainstream media.
Nate Glass began the discussion with a brief presentation of some of the statistics associated with the illegal online pirating of pornography.
He noted that of the three main types of piracy, such as tube sites, file-hosting sites and torrenting sites, almost one third of all torrent files on the internet contain adult content. He added that some of these websites charge as much as six figures per month for advertisements.
The panelists began with a discussion of how the protection of pornography has differed from how other content producers, such as mainstream film and music studios, protect their copyrighted work.
While lawmakers are generally more receptive to creating legislation for mainstream media, people are hesitant about creating and enforcing the same provisions for producers of pornographic content because of the stigma associated with the industry, drake said.
“The stigma will never go away, ever,” she said. “It has defined me to some people to the point where they simply will not acknowledge my existence based on what I do for a living. But I think that says a lot more about them than it says about me.”
Nevertheless, the prevalence of online pirating of pornographic material shows the popularity of pornographic content, and the disconnect between how people use various forms of media.
“I’ve seen comments from people where they say, ‘I’ll pay for Netflix, but I won’t pay for porn,’ so I think maybe there’s people who will pay for mainstream content but not for porn,” Glass said.
He added that people often behave different over the Internet than in daily interactions.
“People don’t realize what they’re doing is wrong, or they think that they can be anonymous and hide by the Internet,” he said.
The two panelists also brought up the issue of confronting further recent regulations on the porn industry in Los Angeles.
drake noted the impact of Measure B, the Los Angeles County ballot initiative that required condoms to be used in pornographic films shot within the county.
“I’ve been asked lately if the industry is leaving Los Angeles, and all signs point to no,” drake said. “Nothing has really changed.”
She added, however, that different companies are responding to new laws in various ways.
“I think what is unfortunately happening with studios that are shooting non-condom is that they are really trying to fly under the radar, which is taking money away from film permitting,” she said. “The adult industry simply did too little too late, we didn’t really think that it was going to happen. I think we as an industry just did not join together, and we didn’t unify, and we really didn’t expect it to happen.”
David Watts, an attendee of the event, said that while he was interested in the digital rights aspect of pornography, he did not realize the scale of online piracy of that nature.
“I didn’t realize that there were a lot of porn Dropbox sites. I think there were a lot of file-sharing sites that Nate Glass talked about that I wasn’t aware of,” he said. “I wasn’t aware of a lot of the statistics that go along with piracy. I certainly knew that there were plenty, plenty, plenty of tube sites, but this event definitely added a lot to it.”

On Wednesday, the USC Marshall School of Business announced a $4 million gift from alumnus Michael R. B. Uytengsu.
The gift will allow for the establishment of the Michael R. B. Uytengsu Endowed Scholarship Fund, and because of the donation, the university will name the first floor of Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall after Uytengsu.
Fertitta Hall is the future home of Marshall’s undergraduate program and will feature state-of-the-art classrooms dedicated to its undergraduate students. There will be experiential learning centers, an interactive library, a cafe and 50 collaboration rooms to help accommodate the group work that is required by business school students. Construction will begin next month and be completed by the fall of 2016.
Uytengsu began his career in investment banking at Salomon Brothers in New York, followed by a stint in Hong Kong and then decided to switch gears and join his family’s food business in 1993. His background as an investment banker allowed him to lead a wide array of successful consolidation and restructuring efforts in the U.S. snack food industry, which contributed to his financial success.
He was also instrumental in forming the privately held National Pretzel following a merger between Sunshine Biscuits and the Keebler Company. National Pretzel was then in turn sold to Con Agra Foods in 2011. Even though financial terms of the deal were not disclosed at the time, National Pretzel had net sales approaching $200 million in the same year.
Michael Wratschko II, a first-year graduate student studying business, noted that the donation makes Uytengsu a role model for all business students.
“Uytengsu’s gift typifies his commitment to academics, philanthropy and the Trojan community,” Wratschko said. “He has provided a road map for other Trojans to follow.”
Michael Uytengsu isn’t the only in his family to make a sizeable gift to the university lately. His brother Fred Uytengsu, a former student athlete and graduate of the class of ’83, gifted $8 million to help build the new aquatic center on McClintock Avenue, now known as the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
That gift was the largest in school history made to the athletics department from a former student-athlete. The new Aquatics Center now houses the USC men’s and women’s swimming, diving and water polo teams.
Michael Uytengsu noted that his time spent at USC provided him with  the necessary tools for his future accomplishments.
“The education I received at Marshall gave me a strong foundation for success … My family believes in the importance of giving back and in making a difference for students who are eager for an education but may not have the means to access it,” Michael Uytengsu said in a university press release.
Both Uytengsus received                           co-entrepreneur of the Year and Alumni of the Year awards from the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies last year. Michael is now a part of a new business, Somersault Snack Company, and a founding partner of the Tusk Estates Winery in Napa Valley, Calif. He has pledged to donate 1 percent of the equity from Somersault to USC.
“If all USC alumni who own businesses would contribute a portion of their profits to the school, the students and the alumni would both benefit immensely,” Uytengsu said.
Jake Kelfer, a junior majoring in business administration, reflected on the strong sense of support when it came to alumni such as Uytengsu giving back to the university.
“The donation from Uytengsu embodies the meaning of the Trojan Family,” Kelfer said. “His donation will serve as a foundation of growth for future Trojans and help them develop into the business leaders of the next generation.”
Uytengsu’s gift marked the second such gift in April for the Marshall School, the first being that of William J. McMorrow which established a Global Real Estate Program at Marshall.
Vice Dean Deborah MacInnis discussed the trend of seven-figure donations received by the Marshall School this month.
“We have a truly inspiring dean in Dean Ellis who is constantly on the road meeting people, conveying the extraordinary accomplishments of our Marshall students [and] really motivating donors to give deeply,” MacInnis said. “Our alumni have been a major part of the fundraising efforts which has, in turn, allowed us to increase our stature and reputation as a top ranked business school.”

Last semester, USC Hospitality and the Undergraduate Student Government created the Trojan Farmers’ Market, a weekly event held in McCarthy Quad. Local farmers, bakers and chefs from the surrounding area gather in the quad every Wednesday to sell their products to students, but one vendor has seen more success than it could ever imagine come out of its weekly visits.
Starting this week, the healthy root vegetable chips from Fusion Variations, one of the most coveted farmers market products, will be sold at the USC Bookstore. After just two semesters at USC, Fusion Variations has seen rapid success, not unlike the rapidly evolving company itself, which has taken off quickly after just over a year in business.
In April 2013, Chef David Rowe officially launched Fusion Variations, a family-run extension of his catering company that came about when he experimented with healthy appetizers.
“[Rowe] wanted to replace [the appetizer and bread plate], and create something more colorful and creative,” said Omar Edwards, director of operations at Fusion Variations. “What he did for his catering clients was he created a root vegetable plate … and it got to a point where he thought, ‘Well, this is pretty convenient, wouldn’t it be cool if I put it all in one bag?’ And he put it in one bag and saw how colorful they were.”
During the first week of June 2013, Fusion Variations’ team launched its product at the Calabasas Farmers Market, and the responses were both positive and constructive.
“[The farmers’ markets] gave us a chance to test market our product when we first started,” Edwards said. “You are really able to sell your product without maximum labels … We were able to test the product out with our customers — they gave us feedback, and we were able to change.”
Last semester, when USC launched its very own farmers market, Fusion Variations was one of the first vendors to sell their product, and they quickly gained a devoted following of returning customers.
“[Customers] are constantly asking, ‘When you’re not here every Saturday or every Wednesday, where can we buy your chips?’” Edwards said.
He went on to note that local stores surrounding farmers markets will often sell their product since they can predict the target market and success of sales.
After a referral and recommendation from a faculty member to the bookstore, Edwards and his team began talking with USC about selling the product on the shelves so students could buy it when Fusion Variations wasn’t there. Now, after negotiations and deliberations, students are finally able to buy the product at a more convenient time.
Along with vending opportunities, the USC community has also led Fusion Variations to form partnerships with USC grads who are active business owners themselves. With their chips currently being sold in nearly 50 stores and a weekly circuit of highly trafficked farmers’ markets, Fusion Variations is well on its way to success.

“I felt a great disturbance in the Force,” a shaken Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) tells Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) during a pivotal scene in George Lucas’ original Star Wars. “As if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced.”
The stars align · Actors Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford have all been spotted in London in the weeks leading up to the official production start date of J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars Episode VII. – Photo courtesy of Lucasfilm
The wizened old Jedi was responding to the psychic aftershocks of the peaceful planet of Alderaan being annihilated by the Death Star, but he may as well have been referring to the fans’ reaction after Disney and Lucasfilm pulled a corporate Order 66 and purged the “Expanded Universe” books, comics and video games from the official continuity of the beloved sci-fi franchise. With the exception of the six films, the upcoming Disney-produced sequels and spin-offs, the now-cancelled Clone Wars animated series and the new Disney XD show Star Wars: Rebels, more than a quarter-century’s worth of storytelling set in a galaxy far, far away has now been demoted to little more than glorified fan-fiction.
The announcement means that many of the Star Wars properties we grew up with, from Timothy Zahn’s highly regarded Thrawn trilogy and Tom Veitch’s audacious Dark Empire comics to LucasArts’ extremely popular Knights of the Old Republic and The Force Unleashed video games, are no longer considered canon. Fans of the Expanded Universe -— or EU for short -— will now have to contend with a Star Wars sequel trilogy that’s unlikely to include Emperor Palpatine returning as a vengeful clone, Luke temporarily turning to the Dark Side and marrying the beautiful assassin Mara Jade, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) siring Force-sensitive twins named Jacen and Jaina, Boba Fett surviving his tumble into the Great Pit of Carkoon and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) being crushed to death by a falling moon. On second thought, let’s be realistic: Han and Leia will in all likelihood still have little Jedi running around, and you’d have to be a scruffy-looking nerf-herder to bet against the return of everyone’s favorite Mandalorian bounty hunter.
So why jettison such a wealth of ready-made material? The thinking behind the decision was to allow Episode VII director J.J. Abrams and legendary screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan (The Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the Lost Ark) as much creative freedom as possible to explore new storylines and characters without being beholden to decades of byzantine narrative restrictions, the kind that give DC and Marvel scribes four-colored nose bleeds.
The action also demonstrates Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy’s considerable media savvy. She timed the “clean slate” announcement to coincide perfectly with the revelation of the best-kept secret in Hollywood: the cast of Episode VII, which was disclosed on Tuesday after months of rampant speculation.
Though plot details remain scant at best, Episode VII is projected to meet its May start date. Principal photography will commence in London’s world-famous Pinewood Studios, the same facility that has housed multiple installments of the James Bond and Harry Potter franchises. The highlight of Kennedy’s announcement, however, was the news that Fisher, Ford and Hamill are all returning to the saga, even though their involvement was already something of a given, especially since Abrams hinted that Kasdan’s screenplay focuses largely on the characters from the original trilogy, with Ford in particular being promised a “gigantic” role. The “Big Three” will be joined by a bevy of talented veterans and newcomers, including Max von Sydow, Andy Serkis, Harry Potter’s Domhnall Gleeson, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver from HBO’s Girls, John Boyega from the British sci-fi comedy Attack the Block and Oscar Isaac, the breakout star of the Coen Brothers’ folk odyssey Inside Llewyn Davis.
As for the fate of the Expanded Universe, fans can take heart in the knowledge that it isn’t being discarded entirely. According to a statement recently released by Lucasfilm, the creative teams involved with each new project will be able to pick and choose elements from the EU to include in future works. For example, Clone Wars found ways to incorporate fan-favorite EU characters such as the rogue Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos, while the upcoming Rebels promises to feature the Imperial Security Bureau, the TIE Fighter manufacturer Sienar Fleet Systems and other organizations that were first introduced in the Star Wars role-playing games of the 1980s.
The old books, video games and comics, meanwhile, will be re-printed under the newly formed “Legends” banner, thus ensuring that future generations will not be denied the twisted genius of Grand Admiral Thrawn, the iconic, Sherlock Holmes-esque villain of the Zahn novels, although his piercing red eyes, azure complexion and sinister intelligence practically cry out for a big screen realization by the likes of Hugo Weaving, Jeremy Irons or Benedict Cumberbatch. Oh well. Maybe they’re saving him for Episode VIII.
Interestingly, the future of the revitalized franchise will begin not with movies or television but in the realm of literature, starting this September with Star Wars: A New Dawn by John Jackson Miller — a story that will serve as a formal introduction to several of the main characters from Rebels — and Star Wars: Tarkin by James Luceno, which charts the career path of the cold-blooded military commander so memorably portrayed by Peter Cushing in the original movie. Both Miller and Luceno are bestselling authors with longstanding ties to the fan community, and their books are being written with input from Kennedy and her story team. To paraphrase Master Yoda: Always in motion, the future of Star Wars is, and only the most capable hands are involved in shaping its destiny.

Its not like they havent done this before. Does anyone still think the ewok movies should stay canon? or what about the stupid droids cartoon? (the one from the ’80s)
Just let it go
How do you compare one or two lousy spin off movies (which aren’t canon anyway) with the entire EU spanning 4000 years and more, with heaps of memorable characters and locations?
hmm lets see here.. the novels and EU kept star wars alive for lucas to return to and screw up.. and now disney have decided to get rid of it.  might i add in the middle of a cliffhanger at the end of crucible that was supposed to continue in the sword of the jedi trilogy.. just leaving us that read the books there forever unknowing where it was headed.. YUP GREAT BUSINESS MOVE!!! :grumbles:
The EU was acting like a engorged tick on the movie universe, and as such it needed to be pushed out. Why not just the books that sucked? Because they had tied everything so closely together that it was impossible.
The idiotic origin story of the Jedi, every single Moesta and Anderson book, tons of comics, and some of the poorly written games just ruined the universe.  
Will it get better? We don’t know yet, but what we do know is that Disney is paying attention to what we DO like, and I have no doubt they will bring in some of the old republic stories, and some of the great stories.
Either way, Lucas  had too many yes men ruining the universe, and this is the best way to go forward.
I call this Firefly syndrome. Take a great story (stories, in this case) and kill it just because. I don’t see why they need to bother about KOTOR – how does that storyline set 4000 years before the movies affect anything going forward?
KOTOR officially gives origins and meanings to things like the colors of lightsaber crystals; something the movies have never done.
While the characters and such in KOTOR are largely irrelevent due to the amount of time that passes, the problem is KOTOR establishes a great deal of science and origin points for objects and lore that are simply not going to be held to accountable standards in the new films.
Quite frankly KOTOR already makes the original movies difficult to explain. Why is it that 4000 years ago people knew how to make armor that can stop a lightsaber blade but than suddenly everyone forgot how?
There’s just a lot of little details that make the KOTOR version of star wars very game friendly, but have never really fit with the movies, not even the originals.
A lot of knowledge was lost forever with Order 66 and the destruction of the Jedi Temple. In ‘A New Hope’, Han Solo dismisses the Jedi as following a hokey religion – that’s how obscure they had become by then. The Republic was already in decline by the time of the Clone Wars, the KOTOR storyline is set during a time of greater strength and stability by contrast.
I have to ask, where have they confirmed that this is what they mean, because I’ve seen 10 different people have 30 different interpretations about what their changes mean.
I hear people claiming that they’re purging the entire EU, that they’re purging the post-RotJ EU, that they’re going to establish some EU things as canon and others as not.
Honestly, I don’t even know which one is accurate, if any. The actual statement they made seems incredibly vague, which is probably why people have drawn so many contradictory conclusions from it.
The only specific thing I think them recalling is that, as this article points out, they’re still free to draw on the EU for new stories… but what does that really mean?
I’m also highly suspicious of the idea that they would declare KotOR (and by extension, TOR) non-canonical as that would be an absurdly idiotic business move. It would be like Blizzard declaring WoW non-canonical.
… sure, as a fan of the RTS Warcraft games and not the MMO, I’d enjoy that, but it would be a TERRIBLE business movie.
I’m not saying that’s NOT what they’re doing, but I wish they would clarify it. If that IS what they’re doing, then I think I’m pretty much done with new Star Wars, and I’ll just stick to my old EU and to the Saga Edition roleplaying games, as that would be a clear indicator that Disney has no idea what its doing.
Especially given that KotOR/TOR have little to no actual bearing on their ability to tell a story set in the post-RotJ era, unless they plan to rewrite the entire lore and mythos of the Star Wars universe from square 1… which would, again, be incredibly idiotic of them.
At any rate, they better be prepared to lose a LOT of fans if they plan to uproot the ENTIRE EU for the sake of three movies.
I don’t mind if they just plan on tidying things up. I mean, its no secret that the EU has become a touch convoluted and not exactly friendly to new-comers, but there’s no reason to throw out the baby with the bathwater. Just do a little trimming, clarify some contradictions… clear away what non-RotJ canon you need to give yourself some room to tell a story, but try to keep what you can relatively intact. Even if the stories change, keep familiar concepts and characters.
I honestly don’t care if they wipe ALL the stories of the post-RotJ EU, so long as they keep as many concepts and characters as they can. Keep Mara Jade, Jaina Solo, Kyle Katarn, the New Republic, the New Jedi Order, the Imperial Remnant. If you have to retell the stories about them, fine, do that, just don’t toss out beloved characters and concepts simply for the sake of a clean slate.
Hell, they could even adapt these for the movies. I know they said the movies won’t be based on existing stories, but that doesn’t mean they can’t use the movies to tell a NEW story about a Yuuzhan Vong invasion, or about Grand Admiral Thrawn (the Thrawn Trilogy is already full of plot holes due to the prequel trilogy anyway, his story could do with a reboot), or if Daisy Ridley’s character really is Jaina Solo, then you could even tell a new story involving Jacen’s fall to the dark side… maybe make it less depressing somehow. Or simply adapt some elements of those stories for a new story. Just don’t toss out everything the fans love.
Oh and please don’t let Boba die in the sarlacc pit. That’s just a sad death for such an awesome character.
They got rid of the old EU, they got rid of me. I’m done.
Man up.

2007 was Seth Rogen’s year. After years of being a funny schlub of a supporting character in the criminally underrated Freaks and Geeks and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Rogen had his breakthrough with the back-to-back smashes Knocked Up and Superbad, which solidified his role as Hollywood’s funniest and most delightfully chubby stoner.
Rogen has had a few successful projects since that year, but it’s safe to say that his work has lost a bit of its quality — after a while, marijuana jokes lost their luster and chubbiness stopped being a punchline.
But with last year’s This is the End, where Rogen and company redefined the phrase “so meta,” and the upcoming Neighbors, Rogen seems to have regained the magic that made Hollywood fall in love with him in the first place. Instead of relying on the same ol’ stoner jokes, the Judd Apatow comedy fraternity has gone back to the drawing board and chosen the most basic location to set a comedy — an actual fraternity.
In Neighbors, Rogen plays Mac, the devoted husband of Kelly (Rose Byrne) and loving father of baby Stella. Though Mac is another one of Rogen’s stoner personas caught in an extreme situation, his darling affection for his family makes him less of an annoyance.
One day, Mac and Kelly look out their window to see that one of the local university’s fraternities is moving in next door. Mac and Kelly decide to play it as “cool” as possible, walking over to share a joint with the fraternity president, played by Zac Efron, but what starts out as harmless fun turns into an epic, neighbors-from-Hell saga.
Rogen is joined by the aforementioned Rose Byrne, who commits herself fully to what could have been a rather hackneyed secondary role. Allowing her native Australian accent to shine, Byrne brings the production down to earth, even when she’s shouting expletives at the top of her lungs. The other supporting characters are equally as charming, especially Ike Barinholtz and Carla Gallo as Mac and Kelly’s psychotic and divorced best friends, Jimmy and Paula.
But the real standout here is Disney-meets-gym star Zac Efron as fraternity president Teddy Sanders. Not afraid to get down and dirty, Efron erases any sense of vanity that good-looking young actors tend to have.
Actor Dave Franco plays Teddy’s partner in crime, Pete, and manages to get quite a few laughs along with fellow fraternity brothers Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jerrod Carmichael.
The film’s set reportedly encouraged as much improvisation as possible, which is not surprising considering how out-of-nowhere some of the jokes seem. But that’s one of the film’s endearing qualities: You can tell just how much fun the actors are having onscreen.
As a result, fraternity life has never looked quite this joyful. The parties at Delta Psi are underscored by thumping, catchy “bro anthems” and showed the brothers gyrating with sexy coeds under neon lights. The film’s climax centers around a marijuana-themed party (surprise, surprise) that sees the Deltas light giant trash barrels full of weed on fire, hot-boxing their entire fraternity house in an attempt to secure a place among Delta Psi legends.
Apart from the core cast of comedians, a few of the best moments in Neighbors were thanks to well-placed cameos by other members of the so-called “comedy frat.” Workaholics stars Blake Anderson, Adam DeVine and Anders Holm, for example, appear in a hazy memory of Delta Psis in the ’70s inadvertently inventing the game of beer pong. The Lonely Island’s Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone are pictured as the founders of the Toga party after a production of Julius Caesar by Deltas in the 1920s gets out of hand. And Jake Johnson of New Girl fame is heralded as the pioneer behind the “boot and rally,” disgustingly vomiting into his boot and then continuing to party even harder. The best cameo, however, had to be at the hands of former Friends star Lisa Kudrow, who kills it as a smart-aleck Dean who keeps it real.
These brief performances speak to the film’s star power and show that the story doesn’t have to be that interesting, but in the hands of the right actors, decent jokes can be elevated to something that rivals comedy.

It’s amazing anyone can avoid Game of Thrones coverage — from The New York Times and the Daily Beast to TV Guide and The New Republic, recaps of the show are too plentiful to ignore, even for non-viewers. If you are one of the few who has followed the series, however, be warned: spoilers follow.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
 
For many, spoilers won’t matter as they have already seen Sunday’s episode, “Oathkeeper,” which garnered a series high of 6.9 million viewers. The spike in viewers — which topped the season four premiere — came after a very controversial episode, “Breaker of Chains,” which showcased everyone’s favorite incestuous couple, twins Jaime and Cersei Lannister, in a scene where Jaime rapes Cersei in front of their dead son.
Higher ratings are probably just what showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss were hoping for when they wrote that episode. After all, the sexual encounter was not depicted as a rape in the book series.
Though there will always be a need to make changes when interpreting books for the screen — something that the Game of Thrones writers have done extremely well in streamlining author George R.R. Martin’s colossal novels — rape has become too common a tool used to increase viewership in television.
Earlier this year, Downton Abbey faced a similar problem. Not only was the rape of lady’s maid Anna completely out of place, it was also treated horribly in the show as the series focused on her husband, Bates, rather than her own recovery. More than anything, it appears that the show ran out of ideas and decided to throw in a good ol’ rape storyline to heat up viewership.
Game of Thrones is a completely different show, but one that has now committed a similar transgression. For those who don’t watch Game of Thrones — and, now knowing it involves a man’s rape of his twin, probably never want to — the rape scene isn’t as surprising as it might sound. The show has become a success partly because of its shock value. Protagonists are regularly killed off, mass slaughters occur at weddings and young girls murder old men with a vengeance.
But unlike most of these storylines, the rape didn’t happen in the book. In the corresponding novel in the series, A Storm of Swords, Cersei originally has some mild protestations to having sex in a holy place, but soon is just as willing as Jaime himself. Though Martin addressed the controversy on his blog, saying that the chapter is told from Jaime’s point of view, meaning “the reader is inside his head, hearing his thoughts,” and that the timeline has been changed in the show so that “the setting is the same, but neither character is in the same place as in the books.”
Despite the fact that both these points are true, having Jaime rape Cersei completely changes his character. Though he is a morally questionable person to begin with, it appears throughout the series that he is improving, or at least in some ways trying to. Having him rape his sister, however, destroys any progress he’s made and casts his character in a different light. Though part of the point of the show is that characters are not “good” or “bad,” but rather morally ambiguous, it appears as if the show’s writers almost wanted viewers to gloss over the rape as if it was no big deal, just another minor transgression Jaime has committed. This is further reinforced by the most recent episode, in which Jaime is once again painted as a hero who cares deeply for his brother. That plot is easy to buy in the book, however, the on-screen Jaime can no longer be seen as the character he previously was, forever ruining his chance at redemption.
But at least Benioff and Weiss got some extra viewers out of it.

In response to “Students Should Broaden View of Political Activism”
As the current director of the Political Student Assembly, I read the criticisms that Luke Phillips, my successor, presented regarding recent campus protests and sit-ins with a mixture of excitement and concern. Though much of what Luke points out has a great deal of merit and purpose, I do not think he gives full understanding to the issue.
Serving for the past two years at the helm of the Political Student Assembly, which as Luke points out is the primary advocacy group for student political action in Program Board, I can assuredly say that the capacity for student voice at USC is concerning. As I leave this campus and student involvement behind, I hope to impart some advice and bring to light key facts that Luke ignored.
The Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation is a member organization of PSA and as such should be provided the continued and unbiased support of our resources, made up of student fees. Luke was not an active member of PSA last year, when SCALE’s 13-year-long campaign came to an end. For 13 years, SCALE continually urged USC to sign on as an affiliate of the Worker Rights Consortium, an independent labor rights monitoring organization that aims to ease some of the injustices dealt to marginalized communities by our exploitative global capitalist economy of which they are not a part by choice. For 13 years, the petitions, demonstrations, letters and protests of SCALE students were ignored. And in that time, 182 other universities, including every Ivy League institution, became affiliates of the WRC. Finally, SCALE successfully convinced USC to sign on in the spring of last year. It baffles me how USC thinks it can compare to its competitors when it so clearly dismisses its students.
This year, SCALE initiated a new campaign against JanSport and the global clothing conglomerate that owns it, VF Corporation. The complaint against VF Corporation is not, as Luke claims, simply that it owns and operates factories in Bangladesh, but that it specifically has not signed on to the Accord for Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh.
In order for a country to grow and enable civil society participation, as Luke suggests our global capitalist system allows, isn’t it important that we help leverage labor protection standards to help accurately reflect the “equal competition” we need for capitalist economics to work? Luke, however, makes a very good point; even if USC cut its contract with JanSport, this would only be a symbolic gesture and the next bidder would soon fill our space. As the director of PSA, however, this theoretical debate should be irrelevant.
Greater value is given to Luke’s claim that SCALE’s campaign is partially hypocritical when one does more research — VF Corporation is a parent organization of other brands such as Lee, Nautica, North Face  and Vans. I am not certain if USC has contracts with these brands in addition to its contract with JanSport, but it does seem that protestors do not see the full scope of the system they so detest. I’m certain that many protestors would be unable to dress themselves in the morning if they saw all the metaphorical blood spattered on almost every material good they own.
The idea that injustice is a part of human life, however, is not something that our generation has to accept. Student protesters in organizations such as SCALE are the core part of our generation that believes this. On April 15, 18 students occupied Bovard Auditorium after they were denied a meeting with President C. L. Max Nikias for the nth time this year. These students were met with threats of suspension, revoked scholarships and even phone calls home. The fact that Department of Public Safety officers were called in to remove protestors, occupying Bovard during daytime hours, due to the fact that the mass body of protestors presented a fire hazard, is even more ironic — why is it that fire codes are more important here than in other parts of the world?
The second activist event occurred on April 23, when more than 60 students simultaneously occupied four administrative offices on campus. This event was precipitated by the “Occupy Bovard” experience a week prior, but instead students echoed a more general message demanding greater appreciation for student voice. This sentiment is unquestionably something that PSA must support.
I look forward to the future of PSA and political activism at USC, and I hope that future students hold PSA to the high standards of supporting political voice no matter what. But I must leave a suggestion for activists at USC — we barely exist, and it’s more convenient for administration that this continues — so choosing a cause with various degrees of separation and fundamentally debated principles might hurt our capacity for student activism more than it helps.
Meanwhile, students stand by as fences are built around us, budgets are slashed from student affairs and community building activities, and projects to the north of our campus threaten to displace affordable local business and further gentrify the community. We can’t just hope that the administration suddenly opens legitimate dialogue with its students, and it is naive to think this is likely. If students want to see a fundamental shift in the way our university operates, then they must seize it.
Here’s to hoping.

For most people, the end of the year is December 31. Around that time, millions of people around the globe get excited to shed whatever skin they wore the year before and somehow become new and improved versions of themselves.
But this is college — more specifically, USC. For us, the year ends when we finish the last final we’ve spent hours studying for. The next two weeks will be a mix of stress, sleeplessness, crankiness and tears for many students, until the inevitable moment when everyone’s Facebook news feed becomes an advertisement for the 901 Bar & Grill.
For many students, the end of the semester marks the beginning of summer, and they will spend the next three months tanning when they’re not at their internship. But for students like me, as in oh-my-I’m-graduating, the end of the semester marks the end of our undergraduate career.
Students from down the street to oceans away flock to our campus each fall for a multitude of reasons: great locale, great academics, great-looking people. But besides the more mundane-sounding “social life” excuse, there is something in the water here at ’SC. People here are … happy.
Happiness — the feeling of joy and contentment for exactly how your life is in that moment — is something that I’m sure a lot of us graduating seniors will miss. Gone are the days when our biggest concern was choosing between an all-nighter and a trip to The Row. Those tough decisions are now replaced by finding jobs, finding places to live and making sense of what the word “adult” truly means.
It doesn’t matter what your age is or where you’re headed in the next few weeks; we have to remember that we’re all Trojans. We’re built to fight for what we want and never settle. Whether you’ve spent the past few years throwing yourself into your academics, your fraternity, your philanthropy, you know that you’ve given it your all.
But now we’re moving on, and I have a feeling that I’m not the only one who feels both excited and scared at the moment. But isn’t that what’s supposed to happen? No one is really truly ready for life, we’re all just trying to survive one day at a time.
Today is the last edition of the Daily Trojan until fall semester starts up, but make sure you check out all of our online content as well as our weekly edition, Summer Trojan, starting on May 21. The Daily Trojan hopes you enjoyed this semester’s work and all of its changes, most notably our redesign. We hope you continue to look to us for high-quality content this coming summer and fall.
It might be the end of the year, but it’s also the beginning of a new chapter.
Fight On.

Editor-in-Chief, Daily Trojan

I set out with a simple idea when I began this project in August — to focus on domestic political disputes through the lens of nonpartisanship.
“It is a rare day when both parties can initially come together in support of a policy, but it is an even rarer day when one party truly has a monopoly on being right,” I wrote around then.
Design by Mollie Berg
 
Producing a column is not about arguing what you believe is right — rather, it is about arguing for what you believe. The difference is significant because an argument, a statement and even a column are all the beginnings of a discussion, and beginning a discussion having predetermined what is “right” does not a productive discussion produce. Instead, beginning a conversation with what you believe and accepting that you are often not right gives that discussion enormous potential.
“Not right” is different from “wrong.” To believe you are “right” is to believe that you have made a statement that is totally immune to criticism and has no potential to be improved. This is different from arguing what you believe and accepting that the arguments of those who disagree with you might not change your mind but could make your argument stronger.
Here’s an example. In my column last week, I argued that the Supreme Court decided wrongly in upholding a voter-initiated ban on affirmative action in the state of Michigan. I offered several reasons why I believed affirmative action was necessary to promote diversity and correct several structural inequalities in society. To date, a thread with over 95 comments has emerged on social media, with participants passionately defending each side of the debate over affirmative action. Second and third-year law and Ph.D. students dropped their homework and finals studying and older folks dropped their real jobs to write responses to each other’s arguments that exceeded the length of my original column by hundreds of words.
The result was incredible. Regardless of whether or not anyone who participated in the conversation changed his or her views on affirmative action in a meaningful way (I suspect that everyone still possesses the same fundamental conviction), that does not change the fact that the conversation occurred. When a conversation takes place, the intent is not solely to convince the person on the other side but also those listening.
This is another dimension to this conversational model that is perhaps more important than the views of the participants — the views of the observers. A public conversation does not occur in a vacuum — there are always those who are still learning about the issue, decidedly undecided or ignorant — but in all three of those cases, civil conversation serves an important role. This doesn’t even have to be applied to the political model — all too many times, basic interactions from group projects in school to agreements between friends are derailed by the decision to be immovable on a particular issue.
This would all be easier if people understood that being “the most right” on an issue doesn’t help in any capacity if you haven’t managed to convince anyone else to support you. In our hypothetical group project, if only one person wants to present with a PowerPoint, even if that person is right that a PowerPoint would be the best way to present, the other people in the group are going to do an awful job, and no one wins.
But speaking of the political model, where only 40 percent of eligible citizens vote in presidential elections, the elected officials who choose the “being right” mentality over the “believe” mentality will swim, and the ones who continue to be staunchly partisan will sink. The country is more diverse, election reforms in states such as California are making it harder to be far left or far right and still win and this Congress has been one of the most unproductive in 100 years.
There are clearly arguments on which compromise is impossible, but to which the conversational model I’ve articulated still applies — racism, sexism and homophobia should be bitterly contested with unwavering resolve. But consider the goal of a conversation with someone who unfortunately has one of those traits — if the goal is to cause them to change their mind, then having a conversation is still important. The “being right” mentality would dictate that the conversation not occur in the first place, a dangerous situation that allows such atrocious views to continue unchallenged.

With only three regular season meetings remaining, USC is sitting in the driver’s seat in the annual Crosstown Gauntlet competition against rival UCLA.
The competition awards 10 points each to the victors of football, women’s volleyball, and men’s and women’s basketball, and all other sports have five points at stake.
After trailing for the majority of the year, USC has surged from behind to take a 5-point lead, 52.5-47.5, in this battle for city bragging rights and school pride. The first program to reach 60 points will clinch the Crosstown Gauntlet Trophy.
Last weekend, it was the USC baseball team’s sweep of the defending national champion Bruins that catapulted the Trojans into the lead. It marked the first sweep of the Bruins since 2005. It was an impressive turnaround for the Trojan baseball squad, who lost to UCLA four times last season.
For the second year in a row, USC put itself in an early hole by losing the rivalry football game. This season, USC hosted UCLA in its regular season finale and fell 35-14 to cede the 10 points to the Bruins.
But USC made up for its failings in football by earning 10 points in women’s volleyball. In November, the No. 7 Women of Troy easily swept the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion (25-22, 25-11, 25-13).
Though UCLA’s men’s basketball program earned the Bruins 10 points this season, USC’s women’s team countered by winning 10 points of their own.
UCLA earned five points in women’s soccer, men’s water polo, women’s cross country and women’s tennis.
USC won five points in women’s swimming, baseball, men’s and women’s golf and women’s sand volleyball.
A few programs split their head-to-head series, with 2.5 points going to each team, including men’s volleyball, men’s tennis and women’s water polo.
The Trojans are looking to take back the gauntlet, which they held for five straight years before the Bruins captured it during the 2012-2013 athletic campaign.
The regular season events remaining between the schools include an early morning clash in women’s rowing at the Port of Los Angeles on Saturday May 3, followed by the annual USC vs. UCLA dual meet in men’s and women’s track and field on Sunday, May 4, in Westwood.
USC’s eighth-ranked women’s rowing team looks in good shape to beat the No. 12 Bruins this season, as the Women of Troy are a perfect 12-0 in dual meets this season. Last year, USC pulled off a 6-1 win over UCLA.
Ranked No. 8 on the women’s side and No. 12 on the men’s, USC track and field will be looking for retribution on the track after the Bruins swept last year’s meet at Loker Stadium.
The sprinters will likely lead the way for USC with senior All-American Aaron Brown looking to achieve a career sweep of the Bruins in the 100m dash. On the women’s side, the Trojans, led by senior Jessica Davis, hold five times in the Top 25 in the 100m and 200m dashes.
Should the two teams meet in postseason play in men’s tennis, women’s water polo or baseball, the winners of those events will also earn points for their respective schools.

It’s that time of year again — the moment that USC’s men’s and women’s tennis teams have been preparing for all season long. The NCAA tennis team championships are beginning on May 9, and the Trojan squads are prepared to make themselves heard.
Both the Trojans and the Women of Troy will face off against the Idaho Vandals in the first round of the tournament at USC’s Marks Stadium from May 9-11.
USC’s men’s tennis team, the top-ranked squad in the nation, earned the No. 1 overall seed in the 64-team tournament and will host Idaho on May 10 at noon.
“It’s an honor and it’s a privilege to be the No. 1 seed, and that’s great,” said USC head coach Peter Smith. “But that and a dollar will get you a cup of coffee — it’s really meaningless. I’m not really ever into what we’ve done, it’s all about what we’re gonna do.”
The Trojans boast a 26-3 overall record heading into the NCAA tournament, highlighted by two wins over crosstown rival UCLA, a run to the championships of the ITA Team National Indoor Tournament and a perfect 7-0 mark in Pac-12 play.
Heading into NCAAs, though, the team will have to bounce back from last weekend’s loss in the Pac-12 championship match to the Bruins (22-3, 6-1). In that match, the Trojans ceded the doubles point and couldn’t pull their weight in singles, despite wins on the top two courts by junior Yannick Hanfmann and senior co-captain Ray Sarmiento.
In the first round of NCAAs, USC will host unranked Idaho (11-13, 2-1 Western Athletic Conderence), who received an automatic bid to the tournament by winning the WAC tournament. Idaho has no players ranked in singles or doubles by the ITA, but is riding a season-high four-match winning streak.
Should the Trojans defeat the Vandals in the first round, they would face the winner of the first-round matchup between No. 28 Oklahoma State and No. 43 Michigan in a second-round tilt on May 11 at 1 p.m. The Cowboys are the second-seeded team in the West regional and boast a 21-7 record, while the Wolverines have put together a 16-12 record this season.
In the time leading up to the tournament, the Trojans are focusing on sharpening their skills.
“I think these two weeks are gonna be key for what’s gonna happen at the NCAAs,” said junior Roberto Quiroz, who has won 17 straight matches. “We have to push ourselves and try to get better every day to give ourselves a chance to win it.”
Last year, the Trojans breezed through the first two rounds of the tournament and the Round of 16. This set up a quarterfinal tilt against Ohio State in which the Buckeyes were able to end USC’s drive for a fifth straight national championship.
Smith asserts that this team has a better shot of making a deep run in the tournament than last year’s team did.
“I think we’re a lot closer [than last year’s squad],” Smith said. “I think everybody mostly has their egos in check, I think everybody is team-oriented, team-first. And so I think the culture of this team is a lot better than the culture of that team. I would say culture wins out over talent, 99 times out of 100.”
And while USC’s men’s team appears even stronger than it did at this time last year, USC’s women’s squad has had quite a rocky season.
Last year around this time, the Women of Troy earned the No. 5 overall seed after going 21-2 on the season. This time around, USC’s 13th-ranked women’s team is 16-7 and is heading into the NCAA tournament as the No. 16 seed. Though the team hasn’t put together quite as impressive of a record as it did last season, some members still found success at this year’s Pac-12 championships.
Though the men’s conference tournament is a team competition, the women play in singles or doubles only, and USC’s women put on a dominant performance last weekend in Ojai, Calif.
Junior Zoë Scandalis, ranked No. 27 in the nation, defeated four nationally ranked opponents (two of whom were ranked higher than the San Diego native) on her way to the title match, where she faced off against UCLA’s Jennifer Brady. Scandalis lost in straight sets but demonstrated impressive resolve in making it to the finals.
Additionally, junior Giuliana Olmos won the Pac-12 singles invitational crown.
Olmos continued her winning ways in doubles that day with Christian. In its first tournament together all season, the duo worked its way to a spot in the finals against top-seeded Kristie Ahn and Carol Zhao of Stanford. The Women of Troy kept their composure and upset the Cardinal duo, 6-3, 6-3. With the win, Christian earned her third consecutive Pac-12 doubles crown, having won the title with Santamaria twice before.
“We are very excited about our results at the Pac-12 championship with a doubles victory and a finalist in singles,” said USC women’s head coach Richard Gallien. “Giuliana winning the invitational was a great boost for her as well.”
This success will provide the team some momentum heading into NCAAs against a 19-5 Idaho squad that, despite having no ranked players, just won the WAC championship. The Women of Troy will face Idaho on May 9 at 2 p.m.
If the Women of Troy come out on top against the Vandals, the team will face the winner of the match between No. 17 Michigan and No. 71 Fresno State. Though nothing is guaranteed, Gallien hopes to use the home-court advantage to defeat Idaho and face the challenge of Michigan in the second round on May 11 at 3 p.m.
“We are fired up to host the first two rounds of the NCAAs,” Gallien said. “We need to get by a tough Idaho squad and Michigan team to move on, but we are healthy and confident so I know we are going to be ready to really compete our very best.”
Despite losing star player Santamaria for the season due to an ACL injury, the team is attempting to make a deep run in the tournament relative to last year.
In 2013, the Women of Troy blazed through the opening two rounds at Marks Stadium but couldn’t produce a victory over Stanford in the Round of 16, falling 4-3.
Both the men’s and women’s tennis teams are determined to make it past the first two rounds in Los Angeles and move on to more competitive play in Athens, Ga. Though it will be a long run to the finish line, Smith is convinced that if his Trojans put in the work, they will have what it takes to bring home their fifth national championship trophy in six years.
“Right now, it’s, ‘How much does the team want to suffer in the next two weeks?’” Smith said on a sweltering 90-degree day. “If we want to suffer, then we’ve got a chance. I hope it’s hot like this every single day. It’s miserable, and it’s great. It’s gonna be miserable in Athens, and we’re gonna have to play through that miserableness to be successful.”
USC’s teams have spent all season preparing for this tournament and know that they have to perform their best to come out on top.
Sarmiento says the Trojans are reveling in the chance to display their talents and prove their worth as the No. 1 team in the country.
“Obviously we have a target on our back, but that’s a good thing,” Sarmiento said. “We’ll always be ready.”

I thought it was stupid.
I was standing on the steps of the Physical Education building, overlooking Cromwell field. It was my freshman orientation, and I was stuck there, surrounded by people I didn’t know, being forced to perform that outrageously obnoxious two-finger-V-thing as a 10-piece segment of the Trojan Marching Band blared Tribute to Troy.
“You’re a part of the Trojan Family now,” they said.
“Yada yada,” I thought to myself.
Fast forward four years and I flash Fight On (the aforementioned “outrageously obnoxious two-finger-V-thing”) without a second thought. I’d like to think USC has taught me a few things in my time here, but I don’t think I’ve learned about anything more than I have learned about this notion of the “Trojan Family.” And as cliché as it might sound, there is no part of this school that has taught me more about that notion than USC athletics.
I’m not talking about Saturdays in the fall or something obvious like that. I mean at a personal level. We put many athletes and coaches on such a pedestal that we forget they are, in fact, people. And it is from these people that I learned the most about the Trojan Family.
I remember taking some dull General Education class with then-freshman (now former) wide receiver Marqise Lee. Lee fell asleep quite often in this class (as did many others), but one time he snored, and snored so loudly he actually woke himself up. Needless to say, the whole class laughed at him as he sheepishly tried to play it cool. But we didn’t laugh because this was “Marqise Lee, freshman All-American.” I doubt many in the class actually knew who he was yet. We laughed like we would have at any classmate who embarrassed himself in such a way. He was simply a student, like us; and like us, he was tired and bored.
I remember former USC baseball coach Frank Cruz calling me one random summer afternoon, my semester covering his team long since over, to simply ask how I was enjoying my vacation. I remember telling current baseball coach Dan Hubbs that I had to leave an interview because of a midterm, and having him ask me about it the next time I talked to him.
I remember chatting with former women’s soccer coach Ali Khosroshahin for hours at a time, literally, about a whole lot more than soccer. I even remember former football coach Lane Kiffin, approached at random by a student who wanted to help in the football offices, talking with this student for close to five minutes about what his possibilities were.
That’s a lot of former head coaches I mentioned; such was the state of USC’s marquee athletic programs in my time here, and I didn’t even get to mention former men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill.
So I wasn’t here to see Trojan athletics — specifically football, but basketball and baseball too — in its heyday. Naturally, it’s disappointing that USC never played in a January bowl game in my time here, or a real NCAA tournament game (the opening round in Dayton, Ohio doesn’t count). But that did not put a damper on my learning experiences with this “Trojan Family” I knew practically nothing about.
Earlier this semester, I saw legendary USC running back Sam “Bam” Cunningham milling about the basement of the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism, waiting to speak in a class. I decided not to bother him and returned to my work. But not 30 seconds later, he and former teammate John Papadakis came in and asked if they could sit down while they waited. We talked for some 20-plus minutes about Cunningham’s career and practicing on the old Bovard Field (where the Annenberg Building currently is) and the like. But they also took a genuine interest in me. Where am I from, what year am I, what do I study? Cunningham found that I am an outgoing senior, and asked what I want to do. But not in the general “what are you doing after school?” way that every senior is asked four-to-six times in a given day. He didn’t merely respond “interesting,” or “good luck,” but rather legitimately seemed to care. He asked me a follow-up, and then another, and before I knew it I was receiving career advice from a member of the College Football Hall of Fame.
Sam “Bam” Cunningham is 63 years old, 6-foot-3, 226 pounds, African-American, a former Division I athlete and a first-round NFL draft pick . I am 22 years old, 5-foot-11, 170 pounds, Caucasian and I’ve never played a down of competitive football in my life. We have almost nothing in common whatsoever. So maybe he was just being polite, and did a great job feigning interest in my life. But I like to think it was a little more than that, because Cunningham and I do share one rather important characteristic: We both went to USC.
The Trojan Family is not about winning competitions or hating UCLA or athletics at all, to be honest. It’s about people, and the bond we all share. Yes, that might manifest itself most obviously when tens of thousands of us descend upon the Coliseum. But it’s more than just clever marketing that causes USC to refer to its alumni not as a network, but as a Family.
Trojans possess a sort of unconditional and unwavering love for USC, and each other, that you would expect to find in a family. And much like a family is always there — through thick and think, for better or for worse — so too is the Trojan Family.
That 10-piece band and “Tribute to Troy” and Fight On? It honestly was a little over the top. I still roll my eyes at the thought of it; so 18-year-old me was right about that. But you know what else makes me roll my eyes quite often? My “actual” family. And so 18-year-old me was also wrong. The Trojan Family is real. And I’m privileged to be a part of it.

The USC golf programs will venture into familiar territory in the next few weeks as they each chase an NCAA championship. The women’s team  has defended its 2013 national title with a historically impressive season,  and will begin postseason play on May 8 in Suncadia, Wash. The No. 1 Women of Troy are the top seed in the West region, and will look to win their fifth consecutive regional title.

Though USC will certainly be the team to beat as the tournament progresses, its path will not be easy. The deep field consists of 72 teams across three regions, forcing any title contender to be on its game.
Outside of the West region, No. 2 UCLA will serve as the top seed in the central region. Also in the central will be Pac-12 opponents Arizona, California and Colorado. Seventh-ranked Stanford, who upset USC for the Pac-12 championship, will be the conference’s lone representative in the east region.
It has been a balanced effort for the Women of Troy of late, as the team has had four different top scorers in their last four events. Reigning NCAA individual champion Annie Park has been excellent this season, winning one event and leading the team in stroke average. The sophomore has placed in the top 10 in each of her last two tournaments. Junior Doris Chen, freshman Karen Chung, sophomore Kyung Kim and senior Sophia Popov have also been strong. Popov, a communication major with a 3.53 cumulative GPA, was recently named the Pac-12 women’s golf Scholar-Athlete of the Year.
Head coach Andrea Gaston feels that her team is still hungry, even after an unprecedented amount of success over the past two seasons.
“It’s never easy having a target on your back,” Gaston said. “But I believe our players embrace the challenge. They want to win every tournament we compete in.”
On the men’s side, the NCAA championship picture is not as clear. After a fifth-place finish at the Pac-12 championships, the No. 21 Trojans must wait until May 5 to learn their postseason fate. Considering USC is ranked in the top 25, head coach Chris Zambri is confident his team will receive a favorable at-large bid.
“We know we will be selected to go to NCAA Regionals,” Zambri said. “We are ready to go wherever they send us. There are 6 sites spread all over the country and we will be confident wherever we end up being sent.”
Much of the team’s firepower this year has come from a surprising source: freshman sensation Rico Hoey. The Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. native leads the team in stroke average and was named the Pac-12’s Freshman of the Year. Zambri has been impressed by his star’s adjustment to the college game.
“I am proud of Rico and the way he performed this year,” the coach said. “There was no question he was the freshman of the year in our conference. He has shown to be a real leader for us even at a young age. We will be relying on more great play from him in to the postseason.”
The Trojans have struggled with depth all season, but the team’s hopes in that area were bolstered at the Pac-12 tournament last weekend. Though the team finished fifth, it did so even with poor performances from Hoey and junior Anthony Paolucci. Instead, unheralded juniors Paul Smith and Eric Sugimoto turned in top 10 individual performances to lead the team. If the team can string together strong efforts from all of its golfers, it has a strong chance to advance deep into the postseason.
The NCAA Men’s Golf Championship selection show will broadcast by the Golf Channel on May 5 at 10 a.m. Play begins on May 15.

USC’s baseball team failed to extend its nine-game winning streak Tuesday night in a 6-2 loss to UC Irvine at Dedeaux Field. Though the Trojans out-hit the Anteaters 10 to 9, USC stranded 11 runners on base throughout the game. Sophomore infielder Blake Lacey and senior catcher Jake Hernandez managed to sustain their hot hitting, going 3-4 and 2-4 at the plate, respectively.

The Trojans rallied in the bottom of the 6th inning to tie the game up, but the team faced some serious trouble defensively in the top of the 7th inning due to subpar relief pitching and miscommunication between infielders.
Despite the team’s disappointing performance, Hernandez believes the team needs to brush off the loss and move forward completely.
“We need to take yesterday’s game as a learning tool to use for future reference and try to learn from our mistakes,” Hernandez said. “We’ve gotta shake [Tuesday’s loss] off just like any other loss we’ve had and learn from what we did wrong. Now we’ve gotta stick to what we do best: defense, pitching, and staying low and hard up the middle. One loss isn’t gonna kill us; we’ve still got a good record and we know what we have to do to finish off the season right.”
This Friday, in the first game of the season’s final away series, the Trojans will take on the Washington State Cougars at Bailey-Brayton Field in Pullman, Wash. The Cougars currently hold an 18-22 overall record, a 9-7 home game record and a 8-10 record in the Pac-12. Washington State sits in seventh place in the Pac-12 standings while USC fell to fourth after Tuesday’s loss.
The Cougars, similarly to the Trojans, have three starters batting over .300, with Yale Rosen leading the Cougars with a .340 average. Hernandez insists that the key to winning this weekend’s series is the Trojans continuing to play their best baseball possible.
“We’ve got to stick to our game this weekend in terms of pitching, throwing strikes and playing solid defense,” Hernandez said. “In terms of hitting, we’ve got to stay calm at the plate and capitalize on having runners in scoring position.”
After this weekend’s series, the Trojans only have eight more games until the start of the postseason. USC baseball has not made a run at the postseason since 2005, a trend the 2014 Trojans hope to end with their stellar pitching.
“Our pitchers have been fantastic lately,” Hernandez said. “They’ve been attacking the zone a lot and it gets the tempo of the game going for everyone. The pitchers have been holding it together in a lot of tight ball games.”
At this time last season, the Trojans held a 16-27 overall record and stood in eighth place in the Pac-12 standings.
Though this season certainly wasn’t perfect, the Trojans feel very proud of their work so far and hope to end the season on a high note and to make a run at the postseason.
“We’ve had our shares of up and downs this year, but overall I think we’ve played great,” Hernandez said, regarding his final season as a Trojan. “We had a big run in the beginning, a bit of a speed bump in the middle, and we’re having a run right now. As long as we finish strong, I think we’ll be okay going into the postseason. It’s been a good season and a big change in the right direction for USC baseball.”
