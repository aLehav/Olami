“He’s going for the corner.  He’s got it.  Vince Young scores.”
The call came courtesy of Keith Jackson.  The play?  A fourth-down scramble by Texas quarterback Vince Young that gave the Longhorns an epic 41-38 victory over USC in the 2006 BCS Championship game.
The loss snapped USC’s win streak at 34 games and denied the program a third-straight national championship.  Now, Trojan fans itching for revenge will get their shot — starting in 2017.
According to USC Athletic Director Pat Haden, the two football programs have agreed to play a home-and-home series in 2017 and 2018.
“USC versus Texas is a classic match-up and I’m sure fans from both schools, as well as all college football fans, will look forward to these games with much anticipation,” Haden said. “It’s been a long time since USC has played Texas in the regular season, and of course we all remember how exciting the recent bowl game meeting was between the teams.”
The Trojans will host Texas on Sept. 16, 2017 in the Coliseum.  USC will play in Austin, Tex. on Sept. 15 the following year.  The Trojans lead the all-time series 4-1, with their only defeat coming in the 2006 Rose Bowl.  USC beat Texas four times between 1955 and 1967.
USC also filled out its 2013 schedule with a home game against Utah State on Sept. 21.
“We’re also glad to be able to fill out our 2013 schedule by adding Utah State as a seventh home game that year,” Haden said.

It’s true. Google is taking over the technological world.
We’ve already experienced the fail-proof Google search engine, Google Maps, Google translate, Google smart phones and Gmail to name a few. There’s even been industry buzz about a Google television in development, which has all the cable companies in shivers.
And to add to this long list of Google domination, the officials at the conglomerate announced something new and exciting, yet not completely unprecedented: free phone calls.
You better believe it. Google added Google Voice capability to its email service on Wednesday, allowing users to place phone calls from their computers through their Gmail accounts. Google Voice is free for domestic and Canada-bound calls, though international calls rake up minimal charges. 
For some, this might not come across as anything new or impressive — Skype and iChat have long since popularized this service years. But Google’s newest functionality is yet another innovation to look forward to.
Correction: 8/29/10- A previous version of this blog entry read “Google launched Google Voice Wednesday — a service that allows users to place phone calls from their computers through the Gmail service.”  Although Google Voice’s Gmail calling feature was introduced on Wednesday, the actual Google Voice service has been available since March of 2009. This entry has been corrected to reflect the changes.
Google Voice came out about a year and a half ago and is a completely different service from what you described. Google Voice is essentially a sophisticated call forwarding service.  Please get your facts straight – a simple look at Wikipedia could have helped.
What you described is simply a new feature for the chat engine built into Gmail, not Google Voice.

A $10-million federal grant from the National Science Foundation will go toward USC and eight other universities across the country to further autism research, according to the Associated Press.
The grant will fund the development of a computer system that screens young children for development disorders, especially autism.
The grant money will be shared among the nine universities who received the award: Boston University, Carnegie Mellon, Emory University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Pittsburgh, Georgia Tech University and the Marcus Institute autism research center in Atlanta.
The USC Keck School of Medicine joined forces with the Marino Autism Research Institute in March in an effort to create multidisplinary approaches to the disorder.

The Ronald Tutor Campus Center officially kicked off its weeklong opening celebration with a dedication ceremony Thursday afternoon in International Plaza, attended by President C.L. Max Nikias, Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson and USC Trustee Ronald Tutor.

“What a great day this is for USC. We are celebrating the reality of a long-awaited dream: a campus center that is the heartbeat of our campus,” Nikias said in his speech.
Officiated by Jackson, the ceremony began with a few words from Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni.
“This afternoon we stand together at this historic moment to consecrate the new center of our campus,” Soni said. “May this center be a destination for creativity and imagination, and a beacon for hope and possibility.”
Nikias’ address followed Soni’s, where he spoke about the many features of the campus center and anticipated its role in the years to come.
“Future generations of Trojans will say, ‘Well, I met my wife for the first time at the plaza of the campus center,’” Nikias said. “Here, conversation is encouraged. Here, learning takes place between faculty and students and between Trojans at all stages of their lives.”
Nikias then introduced building namesake Tutor, as well as Tutor’s stepmother and children.
“I’m sorry that I see some of your inheritance being invested at USC,” joked Nikias.
Tutor reflected on his time at USC, and his experience becoming part of the Trojan Family after watching a football game at age 11.
“I can’t tell you emotionally how strongly I feel about being part of this university,” Tutor said. “It’s an unimaginable experience to be feeling what I’m feeling. It’s almost surreal as I reflect back.”
Throughout the dedication, planes in the sky spelled out phrases commemorating the occasion, such as “Trojan Campus Center,” “Trojan Family” and “Thank you Ronald Tutor.”
The skywriting was given as a gift to Ronald Tutor by the Graduate and Professional Student Senate, said GPSS President Jenny Novak.
Novak and Undergraduate Student Government President Chris Cheng gave Tutor a key to the campus center, in thanks for his contribution.
“On behalf of the entire undergraduate student body, I want to thank you for this one-of-a-kind facility that will come to serve as the heart and lifeblood of the University Park Campus,” Cheng said.
To conclude the ceremony, the Trojan Marching Band played a new song commissioned for the event called “Reign of Troy,” which was written by USC alumnus and film composer Mark Watters.

As midterm elections quickly approach, USC’s political organizations are doing what they can to send students a message: Get out and vote.
Participation · Jonathan Brebner, a senior majoring in film production and political science, tables on Trousdale Parkway on Thursday to get students involved in USC College Democrats this election season. - Aditya Tannu | Daily Trojan 
Though nothing’s been finalized, both major on-campus political groups — USC College Democrats and USC College Republicans — are planning events, lectures, trips and meetings to recruit new members and spread word about the upcoming elections.
“We’re really excited to hear what people want to do,” said Micah Scheindlin, a senior and political director of the College Democrats. “We want to get to know our members and see what they’re interested in.”
Scheindlin added that once the group gets an idea of what students are interested in, it will be able to cater more directly to student needs.
“We got hundreds of sign-ups at the involvement fair,” Scheindlin said, adding that he hoped the high number of recruits would mean a high voter turnout.
He noted, however, that voter turnout hasn’t been as high since the 2008 presidential election.
“There’s a lot of activity that came out of that election,” said Ann Crigler, interim director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. “Students wanted to play a role in the political decision-making process.”
Still, she said USC mirrors the national trend. After such a major election, it was expected for voter turnout to die down.
“Involvement varies from year to year,” said Katherine Cook, chairwoman of the College Republicans. “Of course, during presidential election years, involvement is at its peak as students come out to support candidates. We hope to encourage more people to get involved not only in College Republicans but in local campaigns as well.”
This doesn’t mean that there isn’t student interest. Some students on campus want to get involved and say they wish there were more opportunities to do so.
“They’re not doing anything, honestly,” said Angel Lopez, a junior majoring in political science and international relations.
Lopez also said he’d like to see more academic and unbiased political information discussed out in the open, especially concerning major controversial issues.
“It would be cool to have a public religions discourse out on McCarthy Quad — just have panels where people talk and clarify the notions of the Middle East,” Lopez said.
To increase voter numbers this time around, the Unruh Institute will also host a number of events, including its Students Talk Back lunch series — weekly discussions involving political consultants, USC’s political organizations and students — as well as post-election night events.
The College Republicans also plan to host events, starting with a bipartisan memorial for the Sept. 11 attacks.
“Later in the year we will absolutely be hosting speakers that reflect the conservative values and interests of the club,” Cook said. “But this particular event isn’t about being partisan. It’s about being American, and I think people respond to that.”
Both clubs said they hope to increase voter participation through discussion and debate in order to encourage students to become informed.
“We’re past the era where I can say, ‘Read the L.A. Times or Daily Trojan to know [who to vote for],’” Scheindlin said.
Overall, both organizations urged students to do what they can to become informed and vote.
“There are a lot more people involved, and it’s a lot less glamorous, but at the end of the day, your representation elected in this midterm cycle and the decisions they make in office will have a much larger impact on your day-to-day life,” Cook said. “Students should know their vote is critical.”
