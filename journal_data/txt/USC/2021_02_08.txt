A dominant force at Marks Stadium, USC’s men’s and women’s tennis teams combined for an undefeated weekend at home.
The women’s team pulled off two 4-0 wins Saturday, while men’s combined for three 7-0 wins Friday and Sunday. The men remain undefeated, now at 6-0, with the women off to a similarly encouraging 3-1 start to the season.  
Both teams played double-headers this past weekend –– the men took on St. Mary’s College and UC Irvine Friday, while the women faced St. Mary’s and California State Fullerton on Saturday. The men closed out the weekend with a match against San Diego State on Sunday. 
Women’s
In week two of play, the Trojans won every single match against St. Mary’s and California State Fullerton after a 1-1 start to the season last weekend. On the way to two 4-0 wins, USC only dropped two sets in two eventually suspended singles matches against Fullerton.
USC continued its flawless play against St. Mary’s, extending its all-time record against the Gaels to 9-0 with Saturday’s victory. Losing only three games in doubles play, the women grabbed the two matches needed for the doubles point, winning 6-1 and 6-2, respectively. Redshirt senior Claire McKee defeated her opponent in the second set of her singles match, en route to a dominant 6-4, 6-1 win to finish off the morning and lead the Trojans to a 4-0 win.
Returning just hours later, the short rest wore little on the Trojans’ performance. Head coach Alison Swain and company took a little longer to claim the doubles point against Cal State Fullerton, winning two sets in a single break each, ending in 7-5 and 6-4, respectively. However, USC wrapped up singles quickly, winning all matches in straight sets.
Summer Dvorak, a redshirt senior transfer from Duke, played an essential role in both victories for the women this weekend. Dvorak contributed to a 6-1 doubles win against St. Mary’s and won both of her singles matches this weekend –– with final scores of 6-0, 6-0 against St. Mary’s, and 6-2, 6-4, against Cal State Fullerton.
“We played a good doubles point but … when we talked in our little group huddle, we wanted to bring up the energy,” Dvorak said. “Bringing energy at every point, whether it’s doubles, singles, the first point, [or] the last point, is something that I was able to do well today.”
The women will take on No. 5 Pepperdine again Saturday after suffering a 2-4 loss against the Waves last week, a match they “have circled on their calendars,” and will spend the week ahead getting ready for.
“We have some things to clean up in doubles, but for the most part, we will individualize things for our players based on what we saw and [how] they felt coming out of the matches this weekend,” Swain said. “Someone like Summer, we really want her movement to feel good, we want her forehand side to feel good. Those are really important things for her.”
Men’s
The men came out strong on Friday against St. Mary’s, winning the doubles point with ease in two matches by a score of 6-2 and 6-3, respectively. Singles fared similarly, dropping only one set in six matches. Redshirt freshman Colter Smith secured the 7-0 win for the Trojans with the final victory of the day, finishing 7-5, 6-3.
Friday morning’s victory was head coach Brett Masi’s 200th career win, 19 of those coming during his tenure at USC. Propelling off the morning’s win and added excitement, the Trojans held their ground while facing UC Irvine, not dropping a single set along the way.  
Important wins against the Anteaters were captured by junior Mor Bulis, clinching the doubles point with his partner sophomore Stefan Dostanic in a 7-5 win. Bulis also went on to win the final match of the day, a singles victory ending in 6-1, 6-4.
“This weekend we really pushed the guys, we always do, but we pushed the guys to try and come forward a little bit more, try to finish points a little quicker, build the points a certain way,” Masi said. “They did an excellent job, [I] can’t complain.”
USC finished the weekend strong Sunday, culminating in another 7-0 win over San Diego State. With one default win due to a short and injured crew for San Diego State, USC piled it on, gathering another six points for a sweep. 
Redshirt senior Riley Smith powered through Sunday’s action in a 6-2, 6-4 singles win after a suspended doubles match with partner Bulis once the Trojans secured the two match wins needed for the doubles point.
Masi’s group will look to maintain its place as the top-ranked ITA team when the Trojans reappear at the ITA Indoor Championships in Champaign, IL this week to defend their title. The Trojans will start the competition Wednesday by facing No. 19 Kentucky.

The eye of the tiger: what every athlete is supposed to have. Unwavering focus, extreme discipline and a mental toughness to handle any competition. Often sports documentaries praise the mental makeup of some of our greatest athletes, the mindsets that push them to abilities beyond what we think are humanly possible. The new Tiger Woods documentary, however, opened a dialogue that I think can’t be ignored: Despite their seemingly otherworldly abilities, athletes have mental health problems too.
Released on HBO Max in January and set to air on television Feb. 9, “Tiger” takes a dive into one of the golf world’s most beloved — and most controversial — figures of all time: Tiger Woods. The documentary, directed by Matthew Heineman and Matthew Hamacheck, relies on thousands of hours of archival footage coupled with interviews from those in and out of Tiger’s whirlwind career. 
It’s the exact opposite of a gushy Golf channel piece — and that’s exactly what I love about it. The filmmakers dug into his infamous relationship with his father, Earl Woods, who ever since Tiger was four claimed his son would be the world’s next golf messiah. Tiger’s life was fueled by his father’s approval and tortured by the man’s meticulous control over his son’s image. 
Tiger struggled to craft his own identity outside of his father’s pre-planned vision of a golf robot, and the film frames Tiger’s dramatic fall from grace through the lens of a man lost in grief, drug addiction and sex addiction: all true forms of mental illness. 
In the context of a sport padded by PR and proper manners, the filmmakers’ choice to frame Woods in this light was nothing but brave, and I argue almost necessary.
Mental health’s relevancy in U.S. public discourse rose throughout the pandemic in all fields, and sports should not be excluded. Both professional and collegiate players now play under not only the pressure to perform well but under the threat of contracting a deadly virus. Athletes have expressed their grief over loved ones who died from the coronavirus, and others have made incredible sacrifices to separate themselves from their support system to play their game.
It’s true sports media highlights the context of the pandemic while covering the daily cycle of games, but the discussion on what the mental impact of these circumstances are has been relatively mute in comparison. Athletes are expected to perform at superhuman levels while a virus physically debilitates millions of others. That is an exhausting and complex situation to face, and athletes with mental health struggles need a space of understanding to grapple with such a devastating reality. 
In a September letter in the Players Tribune, Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love penned an essay on how the year took a toll on those in high pressure situations. Love had to learn to differentiate his success in sports from his sense of love and self worth — something Tiger apparently never had the opportunity to do growing up. 
“The truth is, the deepest sense of joy and peace that I’ve gained in my life doesn’t have anything to do with basketball,” Love wrote. “It definitely doesn’t have anything to do with money or fame or achievement. You don’t achieve your way out of depression.”
Championships and records make for great media coverage, but it’s time that the whole, complete picture got more coverage — a picture where an athlete’s humanity is put into the frame first and not just their performance.
2020 taught us that sports can be taken away in an instant. A player’s career can end with the snap of one bone or a diagnosis that prevents them from ever playing again. What happens when their worth is built solely on their stats sheet and athletic performance? Their very human struggles with mental illness or with life can become vilified and mocked if it takes them off the court. 
We can’t kid ourselves into thinking that a player performing at their peak ability means that they are also at their peak of happiness. Athletes need to know that it is valid to not play because of mental health concerns, that being a pro athlete can be just as much the dream as it is anxiety inducing. “Tiger” shows that if these feelings aren’t validated, then they’re inevitably going to break.
People need to know they’re not alone, and both athletes and sports media have the power to amplify that message. There is nothing wrong with idolizing athletes and praising mental toughness, but this platform has the same capacity to raise awareness on how hard a life in sports can be.

There’s almost always one thing mainstream films have in common: they are a reflection of cultural values. And in a culture that’s heavily influenced by the importance of family loyalty, Taiwanese award-winning melodrama “Little Big Women” is no exception. 
The Joseph Chen-Chieh Hsu-directed film revolves around the women of the Lin family in a series of present-day and flashback sequences. As their estranged father (Chen Bo Chang, played by Lung Shao Hua) passes away, the situation begins to unravel not only his cluttered legacy but also a Pandora’s box of tightly-sealed family secrets.
The story is primarily focused on the life of Lin Shoying (Shu-Fang Chen), a stoic, elderly woman who authoritatively carries us through the world of the Lin family. Her relationships with each character, especially her three daughters and granddaughter, simultaneously breathe nuanced life and heavy reality into the story as she copes with the resentment and loss of her husband. Chen masterfully carries this matriarch position, capturing the subtleties of Taiwanese family culture — in all of its secretive scandals, guilt-ridden promises and undying resentment and devotion.
However, Chen’s performance is not without the support of a strong cast. Golden Horse-award-winning actress Hsieh Ying-xuan and Taiwanese singer Vivian Hsu play Qing and Yu, respectively – two Lin sisters who, despite growing up under similar familial hardship, have forgone opposite paths to cope with their father’s absence. Sun Ke-fang plays their youngest sister, Jia Jia: a well-intentioned, naive caretaker for Shoying who’s only wanted a relationship with her father. Adding in Buffy Chen, who plays Yu’s optimistic daughter Clementine, creates a multi-generational facet to the family dynamic that many East-Asian grandchildren will relate to.
The film opens with the preparation of Shoying’s 70th birthday party, with Jia Jia planning it at the family restaurant. However, everything comes to a halt when Jia Jia receives the news that her father is dying in the hospital. After his passing, a scene around his coffin quickly unravels each family member’s relationship with him: Jia Jia crying mournfully, Shoying scornfully looking on, Yu leaping into crisis mode about the birthday dinner and Clementine realizing she had a grandfather for the first time. Now expected to remain at their father’s memorial altar until his funeral, the Lin women begin uncovering the life their estranged father left behind him, ridden with mistresses, mistakes and reckless partying.
Another aspect to note is how the film’s cinematography artistically navigates the intricate ins and outs of the Lin family’s life in Tainan, Taiwan. From serene garden shots to the animatic neon lights of the city, viewers are placed right into the lives of the Lin women, as we see their day-to-day struggles, coping mechanisms and the lasting impact their father has had in their lives. Even without verbal expression, Hsu’s filmmaking clearly captures what’s important to each character: Shoying’s cooking, Jia Jia’s friendship with her father’s mistress, Qing’s careless stumbling over her coast-side rocks. The Lin family relationships also reflect many traditional Taiwanese family dynamics, from the overachiever vs rebellious sibling to the secretive, resentful yet devotional nature of traditional Taiwanese wives to their mistreating husbands. 
I feel it’s important to recognize that this film was not made under the traditional Western-film mold. Opposed to the high-action conflict-climax-resolution Western story structure, “Little Big Women” was made through the lens of Taiwanese family culture, emphasizing the complex relationships and struggles within the Lin family. And it’s for that reason it’s beautiful to watch. The family’s bickering over generalized assumptions about each other is what gives satisfaction to their ultimate acceptance and bonding. Shoying’s long-held grudges and traditional values on saving face are what make her climactic emotional confrontations so rewarding. While one can notice and appreciate all of the cultural subtleties they recognize within their own Taiwanese families, you could also make a comparison of your watching “Little Big Women” to your immigrant grandmother’s watching of “Kramer vs. Kramer.”
Nonetheless, “Little Big Women” effectively executes what it wants to. With the exception of several vague, slightly boring scenes, the relationships are generally gripping and gritty. With the aid of carefully-planned dialogues and masterfully-acted performances, the character arcs unfold in deliberate rhythm, slowly building up until they’re well-positioned for satisfying resolutions. While it wouldn’t be my first recommendation for a movie night with my U.S. college friends, “Little Big Women” does something incredibly special, as I’m brought right back to my grandma’s living room, watching her favorite Taiwanese soapy dramas that, time and time again, demonstrate the importance of family loyalty.

Full disclosure: I didn’t watch “Try Harder!,” director and producer Debbie Lum’s new documentary about Asian American students at Lowell High School and their quest to gain admission into the nation’s “elite” universities. Others were talking about it and I wanted to be able to talk about it too, but there were too many (virtual) things going on for me to make the two screenings at the Sundance Film Festival. I was increasingly stressed with upcoming assignments, and I think deep down, I knew it would have been too difficult for me to watch. 
I know it’s silly to write about a film that I haven’t seen yet but just the existence of it is enough. Really, this isn’t even about the film itself, but about the idea of it being here, spotlighting Asian American struggles. Just watching the trailer, I felt like I was going to burst into tears at any moment. Despite the cheerful background music, it was too much for me. Students were talking about Ivy League schools and essentially, the conflation of acceptance letters with their identities, and it just hit too close to home. 
The stories felt especially personal, as someone who just transferred to USC last semester and had spent the past year grappling with many of the same questions these students spoke about in the two-minute trailer. 
Watching those snippets of the film brought up so many memories, most of them emotional. When teachers in the trailer spoke about how difficult it was to get into college, I remembered crying in a religion class as I thought about a particularly heartbreaking college rejection the night before. I felt as if I was back in my senior year of high school, clicking through multiple college application portals and watching as each one told me, in some way or another, that I wasn’t good enough for them.
“It’s OK,” I remember saying even as I felt tears springing to my eyes, “I’m OK. It’s just college.”
Yet it wasn’t “just college.” It was college with a capital C, something that growing up as a Chinese American in the Bay Area, I had grown up believing was my livelihood. I kept a heavy binder full of college materials. Like the students in the trailer, I believed that I needed to attend an “elite” university to be respected. Whenever someone gave me a condescending look or commented negatively about how I wasn’t “smart enough,” I believed that one day I would prove them wrong with the college I went to. 
After I was rejected from multiple colleges, I kept thinking about how much it would have meant to me if anyone had just told me that they understood. That I didn’t have to “get over it” right away, but that I could take some time figuring out who I was without having college make that decision for me. 
That’s why I think films like “Try Harder!” are so powerful. When I reflect on how a two-minute trailer gave me a life lesson more emotional than those in many full-length films, I’m reminded of the significance of representation and empathy. Just the fact that I wanted to cry after watching the trailer is a testament to the power of stories, and more than that, storytelling that actively engages the Asian American community and experience. 
It isn’t just a documentary about academic pressure, but a narrative that probes deeply into Asian American identity. It’s a narrative that makes many Asian American struggles feel validated, seen in ways that are difficult to grasp if you’ve never taken the time to look. Lum tells us to look, and to look closely into ourselves. 
I spent most of my first year as an undergraduate hunched over a laptop in a dorm room, trying to memorize facts and write essays because my dream was to be at USC. It’s why I’m even more grateful to be a student here, writing this arts & entertainment column for the Daily Trojan, and having the opportunity to attend this school. Even if it’s not the typical USC and Los Angeles experience that I dreamed about, I remind myself daily that it’s a privilege for me to be here. Here I thank USC for taking a chance on me, a student who internalized the sentiment of “Fight On!” in my hope of transferring. 
In an interview about the film, Lum said, “I think all of us are like the kids, you know. Everyone knows what it’s like to dream big and try really hard to get there, and that’s kind of what we love about this story.”
I hope that many people watch this documentary when it comes out, if not to understand the experiences of many Asian American students, then to at least appreciate the work that independent filmmakers are doing in bringing important stories to the screen. More importantly, I hope we can learn from the film to respect our dreams while also having critical conversations about the cultures that have shaped them.
As for me, I think I’m going to watch the full film someday, possibly even in the near future, once I can better articulate who I am beyond my college rejections. That’ll be okay, I think. I won’t stress too much about it. With filmmakers like Debbie Lum, I don’t have to try too hard.

“Judas and the Black Messiah” tells the story of Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya), the chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party in the months leading up to his murder. Though Kaluuya gives a career-defining performance as Hampton, the story is told through the lens of Willian O’Neal (Lakeith Stanfield), notorious FBI informant.
After getting arrested for impersonating an FBI agent to steal cars, O’Neal avoids jail time by working for the deceptively friendly FBI agent Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) as an informant. O’Neal is ordered to infiltrate the Black Panthers where he quickly rises to become security captain and friend to Hampton.
Kaluuya and Stanfield are perfect complements as the two leading men. Kaluuya’s passionate intensity is rooted in his full dedication to the Panthers, and Stanfield’s jittery intensity comes from his paranoid internal conflict, creating a haunting parallel between two men trying to protect themselves through starkly different methods.
It seems with each starring role Kaluuya is branded as a breakout star again and again. In this latest show-stopping performance, Kaluuya’s Hampton speaks with such conviction and acts with unwavering bravery that it seems like there is no way he could fail. But history knows things happen differently. 
The film delves deep into Hampton’s life through his relationship with fiancée Deborah Johnson (Dominique Fishback), showing Hampton’s personal side which makes his untimely fate even sadder. Their willingness to love and bring life into the world is a radical act of revolution in and of itself and actress Fishback let this idea guide her performance.
“We think that revolutionaries are only gun carrying and speaking out on platforms,” Fishback said in a virtual roundtable discussion Saturday. “How revolutionary is it to create love and to create life and surrender it to the world, that is extremely radical. On a basic level women are and always have been revolutionary and radical.”
Fishback not only contributed her acting talents but her writing as well. A poem her character reads to Hampton at the beginning of the film sets up the emotional core of the movie, but it was not in the original script. Before production began, Fishback told Director Shaka King that she wanted to add something to the script.
“One of the things [Johnson] says is ‘do you like poetry’ and then we don’t hear a poem, and the Panthers were very poetic people,” Fishback said she emailed to King. “I think that we missed an opportunity if we don’t hear one and [King] said, ‘you are absolutely right, do you want to take a shot at that poem?’ So from the beginning of my involvement with the film I’d written a poem on behalf of Deborah Johnson that she shares with Chairman Fred.”
Though there are only two main women characters in the film, they both support the Panthers in different ways. Judy Harmon (Dominique Thorne) is a rifle-carrying member of the security team who participates in the heart-pounding shootout at the Panther headquarters. 
“It’s no doubt that there are few female faces that you see solely on screen and so it was important to [King] to make sure that we did it was clear what the messaging was, that there was no confusion about the fact that each of these women are just as much of a force as the other people you’ve been seeing on screen,” Thorne said. “With that comes the pressure to represent all the women who really did occupy these spaces.”
Because of the stellar performances of Fishback and Thorne, audiences are left with the message that there is no one right way for a woman to be powerful, bringing strong feminist themes to a movie about men.
The film only falters when it cuts away from the Panthers to the FBI where the only thing more weighed down than the clunky dialogue are the heavy prosthetics that Martin Sheen wears as racist FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. These scenes gave unnecessary context and halted the momentum that the Black Panther’s energy created.
Hoover feared the Black Panther’s power, branding them as the “single greatest threat to our national security.” But when Hampton united marginalized groups in Chicago to form the Rainbow Coalition, the FBI branded them as terrorists and acted in accordance. 
This inaccurate label stuck throughout history, and since Black history is never taught properly in typical classrooms, the events that truly happened are never covered. This film brings light to one part of that history that needs to be properly remembered.
“It’s really seeing what the Black Panther party stood for, what Chairmen Fred stood for is that they healed the sick,” Kaluuya said at the roundtable. “They fed kids with the breakfast program, they educated kids, they covered legal aid, they organized buses in order for people who had family members in prison to go visit them. They really poured love into their community and the narrative of them being a terrorist organization is rooted in white fear.”
The themes of the film are not confined to the past. The movie’s timely release comes after a summer of Black Lives Matter protests and a resurgence of conversations about race in America. 
“[The film] holds a mirror up to society.” Fishback said. “When we think about the fact that Chairman Fred was 21 years old and he was assassinated in his bed and we think about Breonna Taylor being murdered in her bed and the murderers getting off, we can see that we haven’t come so far and that it’s time to take responsibility for the things that we have done.”

As someone who avoids conflicts at all costs, “Malcolm & Marie” is my worst nightmare. Not only did it give me crippling secondhand anxiety, it reminded me of why I hate men: performative bullshit. 
I know those are strong words; the movie is not complete and utter garbage. The actors, Zendaya and John David Washington, had me captivated for sporadic periods of time throughout the film. 
“Malcolm & Marie,” an independent romantic drama shot during the pandemic, is written and directed by Sam Levinson. Zendaya, legendary Generation Z idol, held her own as the wild and chaotic Marie. Washington, who plays Marie’s counterpart Malcolm, started off endearing and turned into a babel of egotistical mania.
The visuals are stunning but flashy. Marie is a captivating, nasty and strong character. Washington plays Malcolm as an asshole, which he is, and breathes life into something halfway polished. Ultimately, he is dusty and difficult.
During the film, I came to the conclusion that Zendaya is a great performer because of her ability to create on-screen chemistry. Though the characters were flawed on a screenwriting level, Washington and Zendaya gave them more life than the movie was worth. 
The movie begins with a nostalgic opening reminiscent of old Hollywood — the black and white coloring, the music and Washington’s dancing. It is automatically apparent that Marie is not in the mood for Malcolm’s euphoria. 
Malcolm sings, dances and unfortunately opens his mouth to reveal the plot. Malcolm and Marie just arrived home after his movie premiere. The two began to argue so quickly; I became nauseous. 
I said to myself, “pull yourself together, do it for Zendaya,” but I had no idea what was to come.
Marie’s attitude is bitter, while Malcom is elated. She reveals that she is upset he forgot to thank her in his speech. 
Malcolm apologizes and tells Marie that she is his world. The two intertwine for intimacy. After a brief hook up, Marie runs outside, and Malcolm loses her. 
“I was outside smoking and you were in here apologizing in whatever emotionally obtuse way made sense to you,” Marie said. “You don’t actually want me to have a life that is separate from yours because you are too fucking needy.”
Malcolm invalidates Marie’s emotions and dismisses her claims. The fight spirals once again. Malcolm belittles her for not trying hard enough to make it as an actress. 
Act one is 45 minutes of arguments. A vicious, brutal and toxic dialogue is spewed from both ends; it is a nod to Levinson’s writing ability but then it just kept going. 
It felt like a screenwriting exercise rather than a fleshed out script. As if a professor had asked, “How long can you make an argument?”
Personally having dealt with toxicity in friendships and relationships, I found it is very usual for ugliness to bubble to the surface in fights, but it was so elongated in “Malcolm & Marie” that it lost relevance.
Music is a large part of the film, but even before the second act, it felt like a crutch for a mood change. Zendaya and Washington are talented enough on their own to play with tension and moods as actors. 
As discussion continues about Malcolm’s film, we discover Marie’s past inspired parts of the script. She feels used and pained that now her tragedy is a movie, and she now longer owns it. Her resentment festers toward him. 
Malcolm is preoccupied with a white film critic from the Los Angeles Times. He worries she will make his film out to be more political than he intended. 
Thus, the plot thins while Marie undresses and takes a bath. Finally peace — but wait, Malcolm has more to say. 
“Why you love being hurt, traumatized and fucking eviscerated?” Malcolm said. “It’s not normal. It’s not healthy, and it permeates every aspect of our relationship … I’ve dated some damaged people in my life, Marie. But none of them wanted to be debased and degraded like you.”
Marie smiles, and Malcolm continues to taunt her. The audience witnesses Malcolm’s emotional abuse and manipulation as he then leaves but comes back to tell Marie how much he loves her, worships her and her mind.
Act one ended as a fever dream, and I thought of “how could there possibly be more?”
Race plays a large part in the film. According to Levinson, the film was a collaborative process between the actors and his script. He admitted there are things he can not speak to as a white man that he wanted to elevate by having Black characters. 
“There’s certain things that I’m not going to get 100% right about what it feels to be a Black creative,” Levinson told Independent. “[W]hat I can do is write what feels true to the character and have faith in the collaborative process of filmmaking.” 
During act two, where films go to die, Malcolm goes on a tirade when the film critic from the L.A. Times publishes a negative review. He screams, tenses and shakes as he holds his phone and reads. 
Words in the review are kind, but Malcolm does not enjoy the critic made his film about politics, even though it is. Particularly acting disgusted that she said he “subverted the white savior trope.” 
“The fact that the L.A. Times will hire such a fucking halfwit is beyond me,” Malcolm screams. “Morons like this sap the world of its mystery because they need everything spelled out with fucking A-B-C blocks.”
The attack lasted for what seemed like years while Marie laughed on the couch. Malcolm explodes with his disgust of her review, and then the movie takes a slight turn. 
As I stated above, the second act is where movies go to die, and “Malcolm & Marie” is an excellent example of this screenwriting lesson. If this movie was 15-20 minutes long, it could be a masterpiece, but alas, it was not. During the second act, the movie pushes the boundaries of just how meta can a film be. 
Meta meaning insulting self-referential. It could be since I was watching the movie with a critical eye that I took it to be this way. However, I watch all movies with a critical eye due to my background in screenwriting. 
The attack on the critic felt personal and unnecessarily brutal. Film critics aren’t perfect, but they are people and Levinson’s writing made it clear their opinions often twist the meanings. 
I’m sorry Sam, if you wanted better reviews go to Letterboxd, get a laugh and then maybe address your pretentiousness. 
In the second act, the movie loses its footing with more arguing, more pettiness and more mania.
The film is pretentious but not self-aware. It’s as if the USC film bros we all know and hate tried to be deep; they’d scratch the surface, but when they try the high dive, they splatter on the cement.
The fighting begins again (at this point, the movie is now devoid of plot) and the real reason why Marie is bitter is revealed; she wanted to be cast in the lead. The movie is her life, and she feels robbed so she puts on a little show. 
She grabs a knife and acts as if she never got clean, Malcolm finally shuts up and stares in awe at her performance. Alas, at what cost. The scene is fantastic and showcases Zendaya’s acting, her ability to create tension and slip between headspaces flawlessly. 
Chips finally fall into place when Marie reiterates why the fight began in the first place. She attacks him for his narcissism and puts him in his place reminding him all she wanted was a thank you for being a good partner to him. 
“I’m the last person standing,” Marie said. “All I wanted tonight was a ‘thank you,’ Malcolm. That is it. That’s all. ‘Thank you, Marie. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for making my life better, for getting your life together.’”
If anything, I now have less faith in straight cis-men. Not even Marie, a beautiful model, can get a man to say thank you. 
All in all, I commend the directing. The visuals kept me engaged more than the plot. The movie could be greatly improved, it is devoid of plot, consciousness and self awareness but it makes up for in soul.
I don’t mean the review to be scathing. I went in as a Zendaya fan and left as a Zendaya fan, but my opinion of Levinson is tainted. While there may be less glory in short films, I truly believe if “Malcolm & Marie” was 20 minutes, it could be a vision of perfection.

Housed in the Viterbi School of Engineering, Amazon’s data research efforts have moved to the University of Southern California to initiate the Center of Secure and Trusted Machine Learning. The partnership, announced in January, will look at customer data throughout the United States and develop research projects with the potential to bring about large-scale privacy preserving solutions.
“Today, machine learning is everywhere — speech recognition, self-driving cars, web searches and even human genes research,” Provost Charles Zukoski said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “However, this advancement in modern technology creates potential privacy issues and leads to ethical questions on how it can be applied. This one-of-a-kind research lab at USC will serve to make machine learning and A.I. technologies more secure and trusted by the public for future generations to come.”
The center isn’t the first instance of USC-Amazon relations — the Amazon Alexa Fund and Alexa Fellowship recently funded more than 21 startups in the USC Viterbi Startup Garage located at Silicon Beach. However, Viterbi Dean Yannis C. Yortsos says that this new partnership is primarily motivated by a different goal: A common pursuit of groundbreaking real-world privacy solutions.
“This center is going to do the fundamental work that allows you to develop applications that can come out of this … I’m expecting a considerable amount of intellectual property that will be generated, and then, [we will] have people that can take this intellectual property and make it useful,” Yortsos said. 
The center focuses on enhancing the security measures for data that is collected directly from consumers, bridging the gap between an immense amount of data that major technology companies acquire and the best practices for applying it in the real world, Yortsos said.
The Amazon partner in the establishment of this new center, Prem Natarajan, is a USC alum. He previously served as the senior vice dean of engineering at Viterbi and the executive director of the Information Sciences Institute, a 300-person R&D organization in Marina Del Rey. Natarajan is now the vice president of Alexa AI, overseeing the Natural Understanding organization of Alexa AI. 
Through the center, both faculty and doctoral student researchers will be able to partake in this research, with the shared priority being new privacy-preserving ML solutions for both USC and Amazon.
Students can become involved through research projects funded by the center and through annual fellowships. Research students in their second, third and fourth years studying in an ML-adjacent field will be nominated and, if chosen, awarded a one-year “Amazon ML Fellows” fellowship for their data research. 
Yortsos said that although ML students primarily come from the electrical engineering and computer science programs, “AI is a technology that permeates pretty much everything.” For this reason, he believes that students from other programs of study, such as industrial systems engineering, aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering or data science will also take interest in the opportunity. 
“I think at the end of the day, many of our undergraduates will benefit as well,” Yortsos said. “It is a more sort of a holistic partnership with the company.”
Avestimehr said that the research opportunities will be accessible to more faculty and researchers than the Viterbi Information Theory and Machine Learning research lab, where he currently serves as director. While the research lab is reserved for Viterbi faculty, the Center for Secure and Trusted Machine Learning will offer possibilities for faculty and students not involved in Viterbi. The center also plans to roll out annual symposiums and workshops for undergraduate students to partake in.
Amazon also stands to gain a lot from collaboration with USC talent, Avestimehr said. As a technology company whose total share of the E-commerce market currently stands at 45%, Amazon has faced raised concerns with data privacy in the past related to its smart home devices, and both the amount and application of consumer data it collects. AI and machine learning expands further than just devices like Amazon Alexa — it is used in product recommendations for Amazon shoppers, Amazon Echo, Amazon Go cashier-less stores and more. Avestimehr clarifies that USC’s demonstrated strength in combining security and machine learning was a large draw for Amazon in deciding on a university partnership. 
“They get talent, we get impact,” Avestimehr said, referring to the real-world contexts that Amazon will be able to expose researchers to. “Understanding [through] this collaboration, what are the real-world challenges that a giant company like Amazon is facing in this domain [will allow] us to define more meaningful problems, more exciting problems, [and have] a bigger impact than what we can do individually.” 
Amazon has recently been taking advantage of this known pool of talented researchers who want to be on the cutting edge of data technology. In the past year, it has established two centers in Los Angeles and New York dedicated to this research: The Center for Secure and Trusted Machine Learning in the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, and the Columbia Center of Artificial Intelligence Technology in the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. The latter partnership was announced in September of last year, followed by the center in metropolitan Los Angeles announced in January of this year.
In terms of research and sourcing projects, Avestimehr said that the center is ready to commence work on machine learning solutions, marking the start of a multi-year partnership that has the potential to impact billions of people around the world.
“It is an exciting, important topic that is in everybody’s mind,” Avestimehr said. “[I] think a university industry partnership on this topic is a great candidate, because it can have a real world impact.”

Restaurants were hit hard by the onset of the coronavirus — but for local Asian restaurants, the struggle was two-fold: not only were they facing the double jeopardy of decreased customers eating out, but many were also facing anti Asian American xenophobia. 
Kevin Su, a senior majoring in business administration at USC, said seeing Asian restaurants closing down because of the coronavirus motivated him to put effort into mitigating the pandemic’s effects. This inspired him to join Open Meal, a service that feeds diners struggling with food insecurity meals from businesses struggling to stay afloat.
“I grew up in the back of a Chinese restaurant, so this pandemic and all the restaurants closing now hit really home for me as someone that kind of grew up in the restaurant,” said Su, a business development team member at Open Meal. 
Open Meal is an entirely online nonprofit organization that allows people in need to purchase meals from partnering small local restaurants using funds provided by donors. As of Feb. 4, Open Meal has received over $20,000 in donations, which has paid for over 3000 meals at 22 participating restaurants in seven major U.S. cities.
Communication and crowdfunding lead Amy Zhou, a senior studying political science and communications at UC Santa Barbara, said the idea for Open Meal came at a hackathon in April 2020, when she was trying to find a solution to food insecurity. At the time, Open Meal was focused on assisting Asian restaurants that were facing the threat of shutting down.
“[W]e’re a team of Asian Americans, and we recognize that a lot of our favorite Asian restaurants were failing; Chinatown was seeing a lot of racist and oppressive violence and attacks,” Zhou said. “[W]e realized if we were all like engineers, product marketers, and people as students like we had the opportunity to build something.”
Open Meal operates by distributing donations, obtained through online event fundraisers and sponsors, to diners who join their platform. Each diner gets $20 a week, and can receive an extra $10 per dependent in their household. Diners use these credits at partnering restaurants, and Open Meal pays the restaurants the money accrued at the end of the week. One of the criteria Su keeps in mind when reaching out to potential business partners is the demographic of the restaurant owners. 
“We favor minority-owned restaurants, because they struggle with the most in the current climate,” Su said. “Their menu items individually also have to be below $14 because we only give our diners $20 in credits per week to use … Also, they need to be able to support our system, so for example, we don’t usually contact franchises, but they already have their own meal ordering system in place, so usually family businesses as well.”
The Open Meal team is confident in sustaining the nonprofit organization long-term, because regardless of the pandemic, food security will always be an issue, and there is “no other platform that works the way Open Meal does,” according to Zhou. In the future, Open Meal is considering partnering with delivery services and supermarkets for people in need. 
For business development team member Bonnie Hui, a USC alumna with a degree in business administration, one of her goals for Open Meal is to figure out a way to make the most of the donations Open Meal receives.
“Our requirement is that a meal is under $16, but I usually look for meals that are around $10, because our diners are given $20, a week in credits so if something’s around $10 then they’d be able to afford two meals,” Hui said. “I’m working in business development, and I think it would be worth looking into more ways to stretch the donors’ dollars in ways where we would still be able to increase restaurants’ revenue, but also provide more meals to our diners.” 
Open Meal has faced the challenge of building trust with non English-speaking restaurant owners who are wary of Open Meal’s legitimacy as a new non-profit, as well as securing enough funding to keep the system running. In particular, Zhou said that it’s hard to inspire donors to donate when they aren’t able to have a face-to-face interaction and have an emotional connection with the person they’re able to financially support through Open Meal.
“We’re currently reworking our mission statement to focus more on the emotional benefits that we are providing to our diners, which is a good shift, because with $20 a week, we’re not exactly solving world hunger. But the emotional benefits … of being able to enjoy the luxury of takeout from a community restaurant that is really dear to you is something powerful,” Hui said. 
Food insecurity is an issue that is directly addressed by other food supply organizations, but Open Meal provides a service that helps bring back some normalcy to diners’ lives, which can be a simple luxury during financially strained times.
“You have food banks and soup kitchens, and those are obviously amazing, but being able to feel like a diner again, feeling like a person ordering food online and go picking it up…the way you want it to look like you have your dietary restrictions, having that process just humanizes yourself again,” Zhou said. “And a lot of diners have shared how impactful and how mentally relieving that it is because that’s something they’re able to experience..”
The experience of having a meal from a mom and pop restaurant you love is one that is often taken for granted, and Open Meal encourages people to participate if they are in need and donate if they can.
“I’m sure a lot of Trojans have a favorite restaurant that they always go to, or they are a kid to restaurant owners … We’d love to support L.A. restaurants since we’re focusing a lot of our efforts on L.A. right now,” Su said. “If you’re also a student finding yourself struggling right now because of [the coronavirus], Open Meal can help take some of that stress off and pay for a few of your meals in a week.”

After nearly two decades without a single federal execution, former President Donald Trump oversaw the killing of 13 people on death row in the last six months of his presidency. At the cost of human life, these executions were largely a political move before the election, meant to contrast President Joe Biden’s stance on abolishing the death penalty with Trump’s label as a “law and order” president.
This spree of state-sanctioned killings and consequent media attention brings the issue of the death penalty to the forefront, providing us an opportunity to understand why it’s irredeemable. 
While I cannot dive deeply into or have as much expertise as I’d like about something as important as the death penalty, I hope scratching the surface of the inequalities of the criminal justice system and the work of nonprofits furthers the conversation, inspires more action and holds elected leaders accountable. 
Since the mid-1990s, support for the death penalty has steadily declined. A majority of Americans now feel that alternatives to the death penalty constitute a better punishment for murder. As public sentiment changes, we have to pressure representatives to take stances that better represent their constituents. 
The argument for abolishing the death penalty is often a moral one, which I believe to be valid. I want to expand, however, on the way capital punishment represents a legal form of racism. Note: The death penalty is also abelist and classist, but it’s impossible to thoroughly investigate all these issues within this limited word count. 
The hard facts don’t lie: The criminal justice system unleashes the power of the death penalty disproportionately on Black people. The racism that leads to this targeted use of the death penalty pervades each step of the judicial process. 
Before a conviction, Black defendants face a trial stacked against them. According to The Death Penalty Information Center, 87% of Black exonerees who’d been sentenced to death faced official misconduct, perjury, or false accusation. In other words, Black defendants are forced to follow the rules of a game, while other players cheat. In this hypothetical board game, other players start 10 spaces ahead while actively rooting for and collaborating to make sure the Black player loses. 
The Sentencing Project reports that white people who strongly associate crimes with people of color are more likely to support capital punishment. Similarly, research by the University of Chicago demonstrates that white people with stronger anti-Black sentiment are more likely to support the death penalty. These assumptions are not a matter of just internal prejudice, but translate into racist action. Duke University found that all-white juries convict Black defendants more than white ones. 
This assumption that Black bodies will be the ones to bear the brunt of capital punishment may explain white people’s strong support for a retributive system of punishment versus a rehabilitative one. More than half of white people support the death penalty compared to 36% of Black people.  
The combined effects of racial prejudice in our justice system lead to the astonishing statistic that Black people make up 42% of people on death row and 34% of those executed, despite representing only 13% of the population.
The racism inherent in the death penalty has irreversible consequences, often leading to the execution of innocent people. For every 10 people executed, one person is exonerated. Even those exonerated before their execution lose years behind bars for a crime they did not commit. However, let’s be clear: Even those guilty of a crime shouldn’t be put to death. 
Now, I want to profile a nonprofit and highlight its efforts to abolish the death penalty. You may be familiar with the Equal Justice Initiative already; perhaps you’ve read founder Bryan Stevenson’s bestselling memoir “Just Mercy,” or watched the movie by the same name. Among other initiatives for criminal justice reform, EJI represents defendants on death row, many of whom are innocent or wrongly convicted. They bring to light the issues surrounding the death penalty in its mission to expose the racism, classism and abelism of the institution. 
In 2010, EJI produced a comprehensive report that documented racial discrimination in jury selection, especially when it came to death penalty cases. EJI not only produces groundbreaking research reports, educational materials and films about criminal justice reform, but also takes profound legal action. In 1993, Bryan Stevenson won the freedom of Walter McMillan, a Black man who spent six years on death row after falsely being convicted of killing a white woman. EJI, led by Bryan Stevenson, has since won relief for 130 people on death row.  
EJI, along with other social justice nonprofits like the ACL, perform the invaluable work of uncovering the racism that cloaks the death penalty. The death penalty legally protects racialized killing and must be abolished. For that reason, Biden — the first U.S. president to openly campaign and win on abolishing the federal death penalty — must be held accountable to keep his promises.

Food is essential to human life, along with sleep, water and oxygen. To eat or not to eat isn’t the question — rather, what we eat. Enter the diet. Diets are so common they’ve assimilated completely into U.S. culture — a New Year’s tradition for some and an essential aspect of life for others.
Dieting isn’t exclusively focused on health, and many people eat food in accordance with cultural, religious or ethical factors. Take veganism, a strictly plant-based diet that nearly 3% of Americans ascribe to, born from pro-animal activism and transformed into a thriving mainstream community, which even has its own dating app, Grazer. Additionally, religions such as Islam and Judaism have certain dietary restrictions followed by many. 
While some individuals align their food preferences based on their values, others focus on the health factor. A healthy diet is unequivocally linked to preventing diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. However, what is the nature of a “good” diet, and how can we be certain what we consume is actually healthy?
Along with creating unhealthy food patterns for many, the United States’ obsession with becoming skinny and dieting has had even more considerable impacts, namely in the form of “miracle” weight loss pills. Introduced to consumers in 1945, Benzedrine, a powerful amphetamine was marketed as a quick way to lose weight and cure depression. A few years later, over half a million civilians were using amphetamines for weight loss. Heavy dosage resulted in psychosis or death, and the drug was prescribed regularly until banned by the Controlled Substances Act of 1971. 
While many of the ridiculous historical fad diets have faded from relevancy, fad diets continue to exist in modern U.S. culture, popularized by unbelievable gains in a short period of time. 
Sensa, a dieting plan centered around sprinkling weight loss food flakes over your food, advertised that “If you stick with Sensa, you could lose 30 pounds in six months.” There was no empirical evidence to Sensa, and they were one of many snake-oil companies eager to tap into the enormous weight loss market, which was valued at $192.2 billion in 2019. Americans are eager to slim down, and end up falling victim to companies like Sensa that take money hand over fist with their high fees; Sensa’s six-month plan is $235.
Absurd fad diets in mind, it is essential to remember that food consumption is a scientific field, filled with innovators. One key contributor is Leonard Davis School of Gerontology professor and Director of the USC Longevity Institute Valter D. Longo, who offers a scientific based rendition of fasting. Unlike Sensa and other miracle diets, Longo tirelessly searches for science behind his meal plan, testing his diet on mice and finding considerable benefits.
Determining the right diet is a prevalent issue for college students especially. Transitioning to self-sufficiency has its toll on the nutritional intake for students, many struggling to navigate the dining hall or cooking for themselves. A study from New York University states that “many college students engage in poor dietary habits, such as high intake of fast foods and other foods high in fat, low intake of fruits, vegetables and dairy and erratic eating behaviors such as meal skipping.” 
Gaining weight at college is so normal, yet it’s become known by the negatively denoted common phrase the “Freshman 15.” Meanwhile numerous students suffer from obsessive dieting; 10-20% of women and 4-10% of men in college have eating disorders.
USC needs to take a more proactive approach towards healthy food intake for their students. To have a healthier campus as a whole, the University should send out regular nutritional articles and offer health food seminars, so that students have the proper resources to create a nutritious diet for themselves. 
Dieting is a nuanced issue, and more regulations need to be implemented within the U.S. market as well. In order to protect consumers, the U.S. government requires clear health warnings for a variety of items, from cigarettes to over the counter medicine. Of course a diet is more abstract, but proponents of diets should be required to test and publish all the impacts their subscribers could experience. 
Consumers continue to be manipulated by salespeople in the health food industry, and without proper education or warning labels, the U.S. public will continue to fall for dangerous or unhealthy fads.
Each individual has a complex and unique body system, varying in metabolism and allergies. There is no universal diet applicable to everyone, and some diets could be especially dangerous to those with specific conditions. Everyone will continue to tailor their eating habits as new information in the nutrient industry emerges, and oversight is necessary for a healthy future for the U.S. public.
