With the semester coming to an end, the Panhellenic and Interfraternity councils are beginning to transfer to new leadership.
The Panhellenic Council announced Monday night that Ayushi Gummadi, current vice president of scholarship, will be next year’s president. The 12 positions on the Panhellenic executive board were also officially announced Monday night following applications and interviews that occurred over the past week.
“We have a really great board in place and a great foundation upon which we can work,” Gummadi, a junior majoring in business administration, said. “We just need to make sure we are prepared and organized to put the word out about our philanthropies. It’s important to be able to work with not only with the Panhellenic community but the university as a whole.”
Applications for positions on the Panhellenic executive board were due Nov. 19, and interviews were held Nov. 21 and Nov. 22 at  the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority house. The entire executive board, along with Panhellenic delegates, were present for each interview.
“I have full faith that the new board will do a good job in keeping up Row relations,” said Laura Redfern, current president of Panhellenic. “My advice would just be to stay objective, keep an open mind and be nice to each other.”
Each Panhellenic chapter presented a slate with their selections for the positions, and current board members voted on the candidates. Candidates who earned the majority vote were contacted by the member of the board currently holding that position.
Redfern said she is excited for the new board to uphold Greek traditions such as the Greek Gala and golf tournament while fostering relationships between the houses.
“I’d like to see them maybe expand on relationships with the other Greek councils and continue philanthropic events,” Redfern said. “It would also be really good to focus on fun programming for new members too so they can continue to stay friends with people in other houses.”
Beth Saul, assistant dean for Student Affairs and Director for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development, said she is looking forward to working with the new board.
“A group of energetic and committed women … will work together to continue the Panhellenic momentum,” Saul said in an e-mail.
Saul said she has high hopes for the upcoming executive board.
“Increase the positive gap between the Panhellenic GPA and the all women’s GPA, provide strong support for high standards in the Panhellenic community, keep the momentum and interest in recruitment and joining, plan events that are classy and enhance the image of USC Greeks and the Panhellenic community specifically,” Saul said.
IFC elections will be held on Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the Kappa Sigma fraternity house. Twenty-one candidates are running for 14 positions on the executive board, said Eric Ronan, current IFC president. Applicants were interviewed and the current executive board put together a slate that will be voted on by all of the fraternity presidents on Wednesday.
Four men are currently running for IFC president, but candidates can still run if not listed on the ballot. Ronan, for example, was not slated for president last year but won the vote of the fraternity presidents and was thus elected to the position.
Ronan said the new board will play a role in bolstering IFC’s relationship with the university.
“I really hope that the new board can continue to strengthen the relationship that our board has built with the university, specifically Student Affairs and the Department of Public Safety,” Ronan said. “It would be great if the next board can advance us philanthropically through hands-on community service events and increase our academic standard.”
As departing IFC President, Ronan had advice for the new president.
“My best advice is for him to really take a step back and talk with all of the presidents of all the houses,” Ronan said. “Try to come up with the best sort of direction and always be in contact with the university.”

For the first time at USC, some students who stayed on campus this Thanksgiving  shared dinner at the president’s house with the leader of the university.
Seven trams left the University Park Campus on Thursday night to take 350 students to the president’s house in San Marino, Calif., which President C. L. Max Nikias and his family had moved into three days earlier.
For many students, this was the only Thanksgiving dinner they had available, said Sharon Kim, a sophomore from Portland, Ore., majoring in psychology and occupational therapy.

“I was really glad to have this, because I didn’t have anywhere to go for Thanksgiving dinner,” she said. “It’s a great way for people to meet each other and to spend time with people from school you don’t know.”
Opening the president’s home to students was the idea of First Lady Niki Nikias, who said she was accustomed to hosting USC students for Thanksgiving dinner.
“If my daughters wanted to bring a few friends who had nowhere else to go, I would tell them, ‘Have them come over; there’s always plenty of food.’ So that’s how the idea came about because I knew we were going to be in the president’s house, and I wanted to follow this tradition that we had,” she said.
The Nikias family felt strongly that it was important to give students on campus a home and family for Thanksgiving, said Georgiana Nikias, a USC law student and one of the president’s two daughters.
“There’s nothing like a home-cooked meal. So I think that’s what my mom was thinking — that Thanksgiving is a time to enjoy a really good meal, sit down and be lazy. You don’t do any homework; you just relax,” she said.
The decision to open the president’s home was unanimous.
“We love the company,” said Maria Nikias, a senior majoring in broadcast journalism. “We know how important food is — good food — on Thanksgiving.”
Formally dressed students entered the mansion in a single line, where each shook hands with the president and his family. Tables were set up in the backyard under a canopy, where servers poured hibiscus lemonade for sitting students.
“I feel like I’m at a wedding,” said Chris Wang, a freshman majoring in biochemical engineering.
In his brief welcoming remarks, Nikias introduced his family and invited the attendees to enjoy a traditional Thanksgiving dinner buffet, which included roast wild turkey with gravy, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, stuffing, squash ravioli, corn bread and onion flatbread.
In his second speech after dinner, President Nikias talked about the importance of Thanksgiving. He spoke of the origins of Thanksgiving, its history and various traditions, from sending a pardoned turkey to Disneyland to planning the next day’s shopping spree.
But he also sought to highlight the meaning of Thanksgiving.
“It reminds us of what is best in us, what is most humble, what is most human,” he said. “It reminds us of what we most value, and it reminds us to be grateful for how interconnected we all are.”
Most of all, he emphasized the importance of family at Thanksgiving.
“More than any other holiday, Thanksgiving is about family, and today you are our family. We are all one family here: the Trojan Family. It is a warm and loving community that runs across the continent and across generations,” President Nikias said. “So today the Nikias family expresses its true appreciation for what you bring to the larger Trojan Family, which binds us together.”
After dinner, a dessert spread of pumpkin pie, ginger cookie cream sandwiches and fudge brownies was served with warm apple cider.
“Dinner was amazing,” said Sunit Rohant, a senior majoring in narrative studies and biological sciences. “I’m not quite done yet with my first plate. They announced you could go up for seconds and thirds, but I don’t think I’ll be able to finish this.”
The Trojan Family, a well-known theme of USC rhetoric, was a common conversation topic that night.
“I’m really glad that he invited all these students here because it just reinforces the idea of the Trojan Family, where we’re actually having a family dinner together on Thanksgiving,” Rohant said. “We went around in a circle and said what we were thankful for and it just reinforces it.”
President Nikias advised students to be thankful for the Trojan Family.
“Students’ years at USC are the years they have to take advantage of what there is to offer, much more than what they are learning in the classroom or the courses they take. Also they have to form these relationships and friendships with students from other parts of the country and other parts of the world because these relationships could stay with them for the rest of their lives,” he said in his speech. “And that’s what the Trojan Family is all about.”
And what is the president thankful for this Thanksgiving?
“I feel blessed because the very best job in higher education today is to be president of this university, and I’m very thankful for that.”
Those of you who did not know about the dinner at the president’s house should still have been able to have a wonderful Thanksgiving. You’re living in Los Angeles. Theaters were open, shopping centers were open, restaurants were open . . . there was a ton of things to do on Thanksgiving in L.A. Personally I went to the movies, then to the Pantry in downtown for turkey dinner. Fun times.
i didnt know about this dinner
I am glad that President Nikias did this, but at the same time it did not take into consideration the students who live in off-campus housing.  Some of them, including me, come from the East Coast and we can’t go home for the break.  It would be nice to have been extended an invitation as well.  Just because we don’t live on campus doesn’t mean we have a place to go for Thanksgiving.
What a wonderful gift you gave these students. The university is lucky to have you.
Dr. Sample was a hard act to follow…but I really like this new President too.
We, at USC, are very lucky & blessed indeed.

The new photography exhibit “Object-tivity” sits comfortably in the indentation that 3001 Gallery makes in the entrance hallway of the Graduate Fine Arts Building on 30th Street between Figueroa and Flower streets.
In the exhibit, 10 USC undergraduate students have stretched the medium of photography to incorporate methods of the Surrealist practice “exquisite corpse,” where one artist creates something and then others add more to it in turn. The end result is a collective effort that determines the finished product.
“As a starting point, each photographer created a list with a minimum of two objects they wanted to make a still life photograph with,” the exhibit’s literature reads “The class then added one object to each photographer’s list. This was done one-at-a-time and kept private from the group,”
The exhibit harkens back to the careers of Surrealist artists such as André Breton and Philippe Soupault, writers who would collaborate on pieces in a similar way to produce an interesting whole — for instance, their famous novel The Magnetic Fields. One needs to look no farther than Marcel Duchamp to see a similar precedent.
3001 Gallery presents a some photographs that immediately appear to be nonsensical to the eye, in that they blur the stability of still life beyond normal understanding. The photographs pair random, unrelated objects together, such as apples and clocks, shoes and straws, and chessboards with money.
The method used in this project lends itself to Abstract Expressionism, a form in which American art becomes increasingly infused with the process of creation, rather than just the finished product.
Artists such as Jackson Pollock and William de Kooning developed this aesthetic and found creative ways to add depth to the practice of art. Hence the almost-ridiculous rules and limitations placed on certain pieces, such as not lifting a paintbrush the whole time of creation.
“Object-tivity” is a descendant of this tradition. The 10 undergraduate students also blended media of collage and minimalism to make the display more dynamic, collaboratively working together to make the random objects come to life.
“In the exhibition each photograph is displayed next to the image whose list of objects the artist chose from. Thus an object only pictured in the mind becomes subjectively utilized in various forms throughout the show,” one display at the exhibit reads.
These practices allow the spectators’ minds to become the real focal point of the exhibit, as it is truly in the eyes of the beholder. This sort of approach makes subjectivity the best thing about the art, indulging in the axiom that there is no objective factor of anything in creativity.
Rather than imposing a strong, graphic meaning or message in the photographs, the artists allow each visitor to have his own experience with what the pieces mean.
This makes the exhibition’s title pretty ironic, playing off the face of the photographs’ objects and the fact that there is nothing objective about them at all. The students have made simple, factual objects into the opposites of their definitions. Fruit and sand serve as artistic devices in light of their own simplicity and commonality.
The exhibition started on Nov. 12 and will last until Dec. 2, when there will be a closing reception from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.
The gallery itself seems to be buried in the urban jungle of University Park. It sits next to an auto shop past Chanos, across the street from Carl’s Jr.
It only seems like an art building once you see grungy, cigarette-smoking 20-somethings leaving with poster boards tucked under their arms. Peering through the glass into the building, one sees and almost smells art supplies.
But this distinct and somewhat secretive placement makes the gallery seem that much more charming and “urban.”
The gallery itself is surrounded by “objects” that have become facts of USC culture, the restaurants and bus stops. It brings a new perspective to how one should view the objectivity of the things seen once exiting the building.
What is the experience of life if not a grand series of subjective thoughts and emotions based on things observed? This is “Object-tivity’s” greatest triumph (in debt to the Surrealists and all the others) — the mirror of the fragmented and surreal nature of reality.

No one would mistake Inglewood, Calif.-born Shawn Chrystopher for a dumb rapper.
Despite the fact that he is still trying to break into the rap and hip-hop industry, Chrystopher says he refuses to “dumb it down.” His website, Honourrolestudent.com, sounds less like the blog of a hard-core rapper dropping f-bombs every sentence and more like the musings of a bespectacled brainiac — oh wait, that’s Chrystopher.
Photo courtesy of TEAM Image PR
Chrystopher is near-sighted, and proudly wears his thick-rimmed glasses like a badge. During his three-year stint at USC, which he entered at 16 with a four-and-a-half-year scholarship, he studied political science.
Now 23 years old, Chrystopher is a dedicated rapper promoting his self-produced upcoming album, You, And Only You.
Yet, he is more than just a singer.
The truth is that rappers need smarts, and Chrystopher has plenty of them — and isn’t afraid to show it. He has complete control over his music — he composes the lyrics, beats and melodies, produces it, sings it and even creates his own artwork for his albums.
Chrystopher is a modern Renaissance man, but as with all struggling musicians, he had to fight to prove himself to the world.
Ever since middle school, where he joined the jazz and marching band in order to get out of his physical education class, Chrystopher fell in love with music and the way it made him feel. Even while he was in college studying politics, music was constantly on his mind, and he found himself scribbling down beats and melodies instead of lecture notes.
As his grades suffered from juggling both academics and musical passion, Chrystopher eventually dropped out of college to pursue his true interest in music.
But trying to break into the music industry is a rigorous challenge. Realizing he was not getting any record deals, Chrystopher tried pooling all his money into a show — only to have not a single person show up.
“I was crushed,” Chrystopher said. “I went home and said, ‘I am done.’ That was definitely the toughest moment in my life.”
The struggles to get his career off the ground, while having “a net worth of zero,” proved to be a formative time for Chrystopher, even serving as the topic of an interlude in his new album:
“Sometimes [my mother and I] would go months without a speak, not her, mostly me, because I was too ashamed to look her in the eye and tell her I’m still in the same f*cked up position as I was in last week: no shows, no deal, no money, just locked up in my room making beats,” he says in the spoken word segment of his album.
But now, instead of an empty audience, he performs in front of sold-out crowds during his college tour while promoting his single “Catch Me If You Can,” in partnership with the eBook marketplace company WOWIO. His catchy and inventive music even garnered a nod from rap king Kanye West, who added this single onto his recent G.O.O.D Ass Music Mixtape.
Even his mother has since tossed her skepticism, and now proudly shares his videos and pictures with her friends.
Chrystopher is a determined creator; even more than his talent, it was his mental attitude and tenacity that helped pull him to success, which he also shares in the same album interlude:
“You’ve got to believe in what you believe and go get your dream when no one thinks this sh*t will come true because at the end of the day, there’s you, and only you,” he say.
It’s the source for his upcoming album’s name, set to be released Dec. 7.
One could say Chrystopher has musical ADD because he can never stay still and be complacent with a single musical style.
All of his songs tell a personal story, and You, and Only You flows like a storybook — a full package that needs to be listened to in its entirety to get the full effect and meaning. He uses elements inspired by different artists and genres to create his own unique “Shawn Chrystopher” music, which, though never the same, has a distinct pop and groove that marks his colorful energy.
“My music is different because I see music as a fingerprint,” Chrystopher said. “Just like each fingerprint is unique to that individual, my music is entirely mine.”
Chrystopher said his three years at USC helped him to become more versatile and sophisticated in creating content for his music. As an Inglewood native, he said attending USC was a culture shock for him.
“[USC] gave me different perceptions on life,” he said. “I used to believe that life is only how I see it. But when I got to be with different people, and we got to converse about different life experiences, I found that you can actually view life differently depending on where you’re from, and who raised you.”
In the same way, Chrystopher wants his music to be multi-dimensional.
“Music is something that transcends languages and transcends barriers,” he said. “It’s like how Bob Marley basically stopped a civil war by making good music. There is just something special about music that can change feelings and can change lives.”
Despite his budding success, however, Chrystopher is very humble — he still calls his mother and sister every day as he travels across the country — but that might be his saving grace within the mash-up of music industry politics.
“I want people to say, ‘That guy Shawn really stayed true to himself, never changed and never molded himself for anyone,’” he said. “I want to be that guy, that model for everyone, who says, ‘This is how I am, like it or not.’”
Shawn – I’m one of your Mother’s friends – you may and may not remember me ; ) I just wanted to say CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR SUCCESS!
I met Shawn at one of his shows in LA.  He was a real cool, down to earth guy.  He definitely deserves the success.

Throughout the fall semester, I have attempted to cross the entire gamut of dreammakers.
In just a few breezy months you’ve met Bear McCreary, renowned composer for film and television whose credit list includes Step Up 3D, Battlestar Galactica and The Walking Dead.
You’ve been introduced to Rod Gilfry, the Grammy-nominated opera singer who has performed on prominent stages around the globe in 74 different roles, and Brian Ralston, a working emergency medical technician turned prolific film composer.
You’ve also read the inspiring advice of Hollywood screenwriter Richard Outten, Disney animator Sandro Corsaro and adventurous entrepreneur Heather Apraku.
Finally, you’ve been informed of the endeavors of many wonderfully ambitious USC students, including musicians and artists such as Kevin Jones, Dan Blanck and Tyler Demorest, as well as Peter Lee Johnson, the prodigious violinist who performed at Spark! the Visions and Voices multimedia event earlier this year.
Yet, within this motley crew of strangers there have been visible patterns in their advice for us here at USC. Each, whether he or she is currently in the trenches or beyond the point of no return, shares an understanding of the hardships we all must confront on the road to our version of happiness.
There is not a shred of self-imposed ignorance when it comes to the realities of certain industries, which are inherently and terrifyingly unstable.
Each individual has lived through the dubious state of pre-college limbo and empathizes with those who have deviated from an artistic or obscure career path for “safer,” more mainstream careers.
“I wouldn’t say I have completely strayed from this path, but I do constantly doubt whether I am good enough to do this,” said Jones, a senior at USC majoring in international relations (global business) and founder of Viceroy magazine.
Without fail, each individual also remains overwhelmingly positive about the journey and the importance of doing what you love to do. Every story is a testament to the possibility of life-affirming achievement despite the stigmas, and each person is a tangible example of someone living his dream with the same stability as the businessman, scientist or physician.
“Certainly there were moments that can be incredibly lonesome … [but] as challenging as that time was for me on a number of levels, it turned out to be one of the most treasured experiences of my creative career,” said Corsaro, creator and showrunner of Disney XD’s Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil.
At the same time, however, this column was never meant to be an assault on the career of the businessman, scientist or physician.
Our society would not function effectively without their existence, and such professions can be equally rewarding for an individual. The aim of this column has always been to halt the subordination of the arts in relation to other fields.
The unfortunate truth is that the arts are treated as lesser interests in elementary and high school and therefore children mature with the perception that artistic ambitions lack practical application when they grow up and enter the “real world.”
But what if we designed a curriculum that married the sciences with the arts in an equal and interdependent partnership? What if young people who struggled in mathematics were given equal opportunity to prove their intelligence in dance and filmmaking?
Yes, programs do exist in schools, but many are underfunded and undefended, and they are not integrated into the curriculum.
“I was always involved in music and had a talent for it but it seems no one really believes that you can make it a career. My parents have been nothing but supportive … but I have heard many words of discouragement along the way,” said Ralston, who composed the score for Luke Kasdan’s Don’t Fade Away.
Dreammaking, by my definition, is the idea that anyone can dream, but it takes passion and resilience to achieve that dream and make it real. It is a process that begins with a more open and empathetic culture, which is certainly burgeoning today, and it is a concept that demands we see the arts as having the same relevance with which we see the sciences.
It’s a sad thing to see a young man give up dreams before he has even been given the chance to fail.
Where would we be without Stephen Sondheim, William Faulkner, Emily Dickinson or Robert Zemeckis? What if their parents and their peers had dissuaded them from pursuing their respective interests? We cannot forget that all of these men and women were once children with childish hopes and childish dreams.
Most importantly, remember that every single individual featured in this column throughout the semester is a USC student or graduate. They all took the same general education courses, ate in the same dining halls, and they continue to bleed cardinal and gold.
Now is not the time to start losing faith in your goals.
Are you still dreaming?

Animated Christmas specials might sound childish, but don’t be afraid to sit down and actually enjoy some classic cartoons — especially if you’re looking for stories with heart. Whether you prefer a comedy or tearjerker, these five animated movies cover a broad range of tastes and interests and are worth checking out.
The Classic: Mickey’s Christmas Carol (1983)
Inside Charles Dickens’ famous tale of charity and heart lives a theme that continuously touches both the young and old — and if there’s one character that everybody knows (and loves), it’s Walt Disney’s Mickey Mouse.
Playing the overworked Bob Cratchit on Christmas Eve, Mickey is adorably sympathetic and quickly wins over the audience in his poverty-stricken plight.
Meanwhile his employer, Scrooge McDuck, a greedy curmudgeon, embarks on a midnight journey with ghosts and comes to regret his past after discovering the true meaning of Christmas spirit.
Mickey’s Christmas Carol is just a half an hour long — the perfect length for a childhood fable.
But for those more interested in a full-length feature, opt for 2009’s A Christmas Carol featuring the voice of Jim Carrey instead.
The Alternative: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)
Sometimes the classic Christmas stories are the ones heard too often — and Tim Burton’s Academy Award-nominated musical feature is a perfect substitute. The 76-minute movie follows Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloweentown, and his dissatisfaction with routine scares.
After stumbling upon a Christmas tree door and entering the realm of mini lights, snow and Santa Claus, he attempts to exchange bats and spiders for reindeer and a sleigh.
Along with the enchanting storyline, the animation itself is a wonder to behold — from the characters’ fluid movements to the details in the cemetery and tower. The movie is most famous for its music, which is both catchy and integral to the story.
The Comical: South Park Christmas Special (1999)
What could be better than a montage of Christmas melodies sung by the cast of South Park?
The episode “Mr. Hankey’s Christmas Classics” from season three is a hilariously unforgettable half hour that cannot be missed, even by non-fans.
Although this animated short may not exactly have a standalone special, it is easily watchable by anyone with a well-rounded (and perhaps crass) sense of humor. Although the entire special is worth watching, some of the highlights include Eric Cartman forgetting the words to “O Holy Night” and Mr. Mackey singing his goofy chorus version of “Carol of the Bells.”
Politically incorrect, vulgar and sacrilegious — this special makes for a delightfully silly Christmas.
The Nostalgic: How the Grinch Stole Christmas (1966)
Does such a title really need an introduction?
Dr. Seuss’ classic tale of transformation from grumpy to heartfelt fully captures — as with Mickey’s Christmas Carol — the entire essence of charitable holiday spirit. The Grinch is mean and green and despises the residents of Whoville — a place where Christmas is publicly adored and celebrated. But how can he stop their dreaded singing?
The tale has been told over the years and was even converted into a full-length film in 2000 (once again, starring Carrey), but the original cartoon still stands strong as the more entertaining and heartwarming version. And how can you top Boris Karloff’s narration?
The Poignant: The Snowman (1982)
Ever make a snowman when you were little? This half-hour special vies to be one of the most touching Christmas stories that might even draw a few tears.
The special follows a young boy who builds a snowman on Christmas Eve only to discover the magical power of Christmas has awakened his frosty friend. The entire animation contains not a single bit of dialogue, which might initially disengage some viewers.
But the music alone is breathtakingly beautiful and makes the dreamlike story speak directly to every viewer. The climactic song “Walking in the Air” is the only scene with words, and even then the lyrics are almost ethereal.
One of the best aspects of The Snowman is its unique, sketch-like animation: Every frame appears hand-drawn and evokes memories of coloring and doodling — a perfect way for the audience to connect to the main character.
For those craving more Snowman-like animation, Father Christmas is a decent companion piece as well.
In the mood for more recent holiday animations? The Polar Express (2004) is a wonderfully whimsical journey, while Shrek the Halls (2007) brings comic relief.
Whatever your taste, there’s a holiday special for you.

The setup: Senior backup quarterback Mitch Mustain made his long-awaited first start in a Trojan uniform after sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley went down with a high-ankle sprain in last week’s loss to Oregon State. Mustain led the Trojans against a struggling Notre Dame team in a game with little hype and fanfare — for the first time since 2001, both teams came into the game unranked.
Road block · Sophomore defensive end Nick Perry forced a fumble on Notre Dame’s eight-yard line during the third quarter on Saturday. The fumble recovery was one of four turnovers the Trojans forced in the game. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The story: It was a fairy-tale ending for Mustain. The Trojans had the game-winning touchdown in the final minute in their grasp.
Then everything slipped away.
In a emotional twist usually found only in movies, the Trojans went from utter jubilation to shock and disappointment as the usually sure-handed senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson dropped a 53-yard touchdown that would’ve put USC up 23-20 with just 1:17 remaining in USC’s last game in the Coliseum this year.
“I was shocked,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said about the dropped pass. “It’s something that we’ve worked on with that coverage. It’s just a shame.”
However, the blame can’t be put solely on Johnson. USC still had multiple chances after that drop with a 14-yard completion to redshirt junior tight end Rhett Ellison on fourth-and-seven and a 16-yard completion to freshman wide receiver Robert Woods on the next play. However, Mustain would throw an interception to end the drive.
USC receivers were dropping passes all night long, which didn’t make life any easier for the first-time Trojan starter.
Senior tight end Jordan Cameron attributed the multitude of drops to a lack of focus.
“It was concentration,” Cameron said. “You got to make plays and be focused. I think a lot of guys took their eyes off the ball, focusing on the yards after the catch but you need to focus when it comes to you. You feel terrible when you drop the ball. It happens to the best of us, you gotta have a short memory.”
Defense rules: In a dramatic turn from where this team began at the start of the season, the Trojan defense was the unit keeping the team in the game with four takeaways that led to all of USC’s points.
On top of only allowing 15 first downs, the second fewest the USC defense has allowed this year, the defense picked off Notre Dame quarterback Tommy Rees three times and advanced a fumble to the Fighting Irish’s two-yard line that led to the only touchdown from the Trojans.
“It was a surprising game from the aspect that prior to the last play of the game we were plus-four in turnover margin,” Kiffin said. “You think that you’d win that game but obviously we got to make more points off the turnovers.”
However, two-minute defense was the one thing that reminded everyone this was still the same unit as the one that took the field against Washington and Stanford earlier this year. All three of Notre Dame’s touchdowns came with less than 2:39 left in each half.
“I’m not sure [why we can’t stop teams in the two-minute drill],” sophomore linebacker Devon Kennard said. “[Saturday] was a little different in that they were getting big runs on us but usually it’s big passes. We got to play more consistent in the second and fourth quarters.”
Injured Trojans: While Mustain made his first start of his Trojan career, Barkley suited up and participated in the captains’ coin toss at the start of the game but wore a baseball cap on the sidelines during the entire contest. He said he knew sometime before the game that he wouldn’t be able to play but said that it was tough watching. He’s anxious to get back on the field next week.
“I’m going to play this week. There’s no doubt about that,” Barkley said. “Whatever needs to happen, I’m going to make it happen.”
Barkley’s injury occurred last week, but another important Trojan was injured on Saturday. Sophomore safety T.J. McDonald, who leads the team in tackles, left the game after making a tackle on the first play of the second series of the game. McDonald separated his shoulder and did not return.
“I came and it was a big hit on the sidelines,” McDonald said. “I got up and it didn’t feel right. I knew something was wrong.”
Walk-on sophomore Tony Burnett took McDonald’s place and recorded 10 tackles, second-highest on the team.
“He did a great job coming in for me,” McDonald said. “I was helping him on the sidelines and to be put in my position in a rivalry game, that’s a big job and for him to come in and do that, that’s great.”
The Trojans are now very thin in a secondary that was already extremely young and inexperienced with its starters at the beginning of the year, as sophomore safety Jawanza Starling, redshirt freshman cornerback Torin Harris and junior cornerback T.J. Bryant are not playing because of injuries.
Senior Day blues: For Mustain, Johnson and a few other key Trojans on the field, this was the last game they played in the Coliseum. To go out in a loss to Notre Dame with the game decided in the final minute wasn’t the way many of these seniors expected to go out.
“It’s extremely disappointing,” senior linebacker Malcolm Smith said. “As disappointing as it gets.”

It’s always a thrill to beat a crosstown rival. The only thing the Women of Troy love more than beating the Bruins once? Beating them twice.
Overpowering · Junior middle blocker Lauren Williams ended the final set of the match with a strike, sealing the win for USC. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The No. 6 USC women’s volleyball team defeated the Bruins in five sets on Friday, sweeping the season series and closing out the season by winning 11 of its final 12 matches.
“I think just everybody’s getting more comfortable together,” said USC head coach Mick Haley. “We’re maturing. We handle adversity well.”
The win did not come easily for the Women of Troy. They fell behind early, as UCLA came out strong and took the first set, 25-20, after closing out the game on an 8-2 run.
“[UCLA] hadn’t lost a match this year at home when they’d won the first game,” Haley said.
The Women of Troy bounced back and took the next two sets, 25-21, 25-20. But UCLA came back and won the fourth set, 25-20, largely thanks to Bruin outside hitter Bojana Todorovic, who recorded 10 of her 21 kills in the fourth game.
USC went down 3-0 early in the fifth set but pushed it to a 3-3 tie after back-to-back kills by middle blocker Lauren Williams, who dealt the final blow to the Bruins with another kill with the score at 14-13, giving the Women of Troy the win in the set and the match.
Although pleased with the win, Haley said he was not completely satisfied with his team’s performance.
“I think we competed really well. I don’t think we played all that well,” Haley said.
“Everybody made some kind of contribution, but nobody seemed to be 100 percent on their game.”
Freshman outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana led the Women of Troy with 23 kills, tying her season high. Junior All-American Alex Jupiter recorded a double-double, adding 17 kills and 15 digs.
“Each one of them contributed significantly to our win,” Haley said. “I thought Alex’s defense was exceptional. I thought Falyn really stepped up offensively.”
Williams added 12 kills, while freshman middle blocker Alexis Olgard posted eight kills and a season high of nine blocks.
USC has now played in eight five-set matches and won all but one of them.
“It certainly helps the self-confidence,” Haley said. “The freshmen get in those matches sometimes, and they get a little scared, but we’ve stepped up in every one of those five game matches with the exception of our second one up in Washington.”
Another thing the Women of Troy have in their favor as they move into postseason play? Their depth.
“We have people coming in off the bench who can certainly help us,” Haley said, who added, “I feel like we’re doing everything right right now.”
This can only help the Women of Troy as they prepare for their upcoming matches this weekend.
USC earned the No. 6 seed in the NCAA tournament, a luxury that will allow the team to potentially host two games at the Galen Center.
The Women of Troy will face off against New Mexico on Friday at home. A victory in that match will allow them to host the winner of Friday’s match between San Diego and Long Beach State.
“I think that’s about as good as we could have hoped for,” Haley said, regarding the team’s seed. “The fact that we get to host at home is very good. We’re right where we want to be.”

The lone skid mark for the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team (26-2, 6-2) this season came in mid-October when the Trojans stumbled in consecutive weeks on the road at Stanford and at home against California. In the words of USC coach Jovan Vavic, complacency had started to set in.
Final strike · Freshman driver Nikola Vavic boosted the Trojans to both an MPSF title and a NCAA berth with his overtime goal. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan 
“Our desire wasn’t where it needed to be,” said the Trojans’ 16th year head coach.
With a guaranteed trip to the NCAA tournament on the line Sunday during the finals of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament, the Trojans emerged 8-7 winners over the Stanford Cardinal in triple overtime.
“Our desire was much greater this time,” Vavic said. “I told the guys that I didn’t do the best job in preparing them for that Stanford game earlier in the year, and in the week leading into this conference tournament, we rested our guys more.”
It paid off for the Trojans, as the youthful bunch was forced to play in three games in three days, including Sunday’s thriller which went far past regulation.
“We didn’t give them morning practices; the practices were shorter,” Vavic said. “We did some stuff that was relaxing for the guys. It was just a much wider work schedule.”
In turn, the Trojans looked fresh in the final moments of a triple-overtime title match with a Cardinal team that had given them trouble in the past. With 1:18 remaining in the fourth quarter, junior two-meter Matt Burton seized an opportunity, putting a five-meter penalty shot past Stanford goalie Brian Pingree to knot the score at five apiece, forcing extra time.
However, initially neither team could gain an upper hand in overtime, forcing sudden death, when freshman driver Nikola Vavic recorded yet another timely game-winner, securing the win, MPSF title and automatic NCAA tournament berth.
“He’s really playing at a high level and some significant minutes,” Vavic said when asked about his son, who finished with six goals in the three-day tournament. “He’s really stepped up in these games.”
But the game that produced a close, contended finish, didn’t start that way.
Despite playing in Stanford’s home pool, the Trojans embarked on a strong run early in the first frame, eventually building a 3-1 lead before the Cardinals were eventually able to crawl back and take a one-goal lead of its own at 5-4.
“Stanford is a very tough defensive team,” Vavic said. “They scouted us really well. They knew our plan. They had good matchups and they are physical, big and strong. They don’t give up. They really are a much better team than their record shows. They made it tough for us.”
But the Trojans, who had already easily disposed of UC Santa Barbara and UCLA 10-5 and 10-2 in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively, leaned heavily on their anchor, junior goalie Joel Dennerley when it counted the most in overtime.
“In the game against Stanford, Joel was tremendous,” Vavic said.  “It was just really unbelievable.  He probably had his best game of the season.”
Dennerley, who finished with 12 saves, was all the more important in overtime. In the first frame of sudden death, the Australian native blocked a shot taken from point-blank range with 54 seconds remaining, which would have given Stanford the win.
Instead, the Trojans, not the Cardinals, have begun preparation for this weekend’s NCAA tournament, scheduled to take place in Berkeley, Calif.
USC, the No. 1 seed, is scheduled to face No. 4-seeded St. Francis at 1 p.m. on Saturday, where a win would put them in the tournament finals for a sixth consecutive, a NCAA record.
“It’s a team loaded with foreign talent,” Vavic said. “They have some very good players, and they can be dangerous. But I do feel we’re in a good position to defend a title.”

Dear 2010 USC football season:
I never thought I’d be asking you this, not after all the good times we’ve had in the past. But, respectfully of course, I have a simple request:
Just end already.
Look, I knew things were going to be difficult this year. I was prepared for less flash and more losses.
Turns out, I wasn’t prepared for this, a once-solid season quickly becoming a downward spiral.
A season that, at one time, looked like a moving train that had just lost a little traction is now nearing a total derailment.
The two heartbreaking losses on last-second field goals to Washington and Stanford were excusable. The loss to Oregon, the best team in the country — we can let that one slide.
I didn’t want to believe it after the embarrassment in Corvallis, Ore. But there’s no denying it after the debacle against the Irish last Saturday.
You, USC season, are on the brink of disaster. So again, I must ask you to quickly and quietly go away.
I know there is the little issue of this final game against UCLA. And while that used to mean something, no matter what the most die-hard Trojan fan will say, there hasn’t been a less-anticipated matchup between the crosstown rivals.
Neither team is bowl-eligible: USC because of sanctions, UCLA because it is really that inept of a football program.
Sure, good old bragging rights are at stake, but will there really be much to brag about even if USC wins in convincing fashion? Why brag about beating a team that got rocked by Arizona State last week and whose signature win came over a Texas team that won’t be going bowling for the first time since 1997?
A USC win against UCLA is always supposed to mean something. But this year, that something is little more than another win notched under the Trojans’ name, another year to put the Victory Bell on display.
That’s all fine and dandy, but it pales in comparison to what USC stands to lose if it falters in this game.
That’s why I’m asking this season to inconspicuously fade away. Because things can only get worse. Only a loss to the Bruins could make this season any more painful than it already has been, culminating with the infamous drop down the stretch against Notre Dame.
I’ve never heard a groan like the one the Coliseum let out when the game-winning touchdown bounced off senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson’s hands. The audience roar built up in budding anticipation was then quickly crushed by a cry that was equal parts anger and disbelief.
After something so shocking, even a win against UCLA — something the Trojans have pulled off 10 times in the last 11 years — no longer feels like a sure thing.
USC fans will be there to support the Trojans, but they’ll be watching through the cracks of their fingers, ready to cover their eyes if the worst comes to pass.
The possibility makes me cringe, so I’d rather just look away.
Of course, I’m not really asking you to cut yourself short, 2010 season. I’ll be watching, however anxiously, when the Trojans take the Rose Bowl field on Saturday. I’m just at a fragile place right now. The sight of Notre Dame jubilantly celebrating on the Coliseum field is still stuck on the insides of my eyelids.
I know you have an obligation to go on until the end. But now you’re like a horror story whose 13th chapter I’m afraid to read.
If you must go on for one more week, please make it quick and easy. Be mindful of the nerves of the USC faithful. We’ve endured way more strain than we were ready for this year.
Trust me, we can try again next season. But after Saturday, no matter the outcome, you will be a season USC fans will quickly try to forget.

Mitch Mustain, the senior backup quarterback starting for injured sophomore Matt Barkley, acknowledged feeling a little frustrated walking off the rain-soaked Los Angeles Coliseum field on Saturday night.
Hanging in the balance · Senior quarterback Mitch Mustain, who was 20-for-37 for 177 yards and an interception, helped the Trojans mount a last-minute comeback attempt, but they were unable to close out the game against Notre Dame. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
On a third-and-seven play from his team’s own 47-yard line, Mustain heaved a pass down the sideline toward a wide open Ronald Johnson, but the ball slipped through the hands of the senior wide receiver, all but dashing the Trojans’ hopes of notching their ninth consecutive victory over their intersectional rival.
“That one probably would have changed the outcome,” Mustain said. “It was unfortunate that [Johnson] dropped it.”
If completed, Johnson likely would have scored, giving USC (7-5, 4-4) a late lead; yet the Trojans were instead outlasted 20-16 to Notre Dame (7-5) for the first time since 2001.
“He cleared the guy before I let it go,” Mustain said, referring to the dropped pass. “I knew he had a chance to beat those guys.”
Instead, the incompletion remains a microcosm of a USC offense that simply could not capitalize on a multitude of opportunities.
Facing a Notre Dame offensive attack led by 18-year-old freshman quarterback Tommy Rees, the Trojan defense forced three interceptions and a fumble, but the offense managed to produce just one touchdown in response — a one-yard quarterback sneak from Mustain on fourth down after originally fielding the ball at the two-yard line.
“If you had told me before that we would be plus four turnovers, I would have expected a different result,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We have to score more points off turnovers.”
A running game, which was largely nonexistent for four quarters, didn’t help. Instead of scoring touchdowns, USC found itself settling for field goals with senior kicker Joe Houston converting three, ranging from 23 yards to a career high of 45.
Primarily featuring a running back tandem of redshirt junior Marc Tyler and senior C.J. Gable, the ground game amassed just 80 yards on 30 carries, an average of 2.7 yards per gain, much to the chagrin of Kiffin.
“I don’t know why the running game didn’t get going,” said the Trojans’ first-year head coach. “We weren’t able to do it.”
The loss stands in stark contrast to USC’s previous eight wins against Notre Dame — eight games in which the Trojans averaged 40 points per contest and seemingly dominated one helpless Irish team after another.
Saturday instead marked a new twist in the rivalry, with Kiffin losing his initial matchup with the Trojans’ storied archrival, which coincidently also happens to be led by a first-year head coach in Brian Kelly.
“I am very disappointed in the outcome,” Kiffin said. “It is a very special game for a lot of people and we let them down. We worked hard to get that eight-game streak.”
Despite their offensive ineptitude, the Trojans were presented with chances, opportunities late in the game that could have otherwise allowed them to walk away with a victory in hand.
Leading 16-13 with 6:25 remaining in the fourth quarter, USC failed to stop Notre Dame’s two-man rushing attack of Cierre Wood and Robert Hughes, which totaled 57 yards on the team’s game-winning seven-play, 77-yard drive, culminating in a five-yard touchdown from Hughes.
Faced with an opportunity to respond with over two minutes remaining, USC’s efforts were futile, as the dropped pass from Johnson was eventually succeeded by an errant throw from Mustain, leading to a game-ending interception.
Outside of pride, however, there isn’t much left for the unranked Trojans to play for. Ineligible and largely unqualified for a finish in the USA Today coaches poll, all that remains for the Trojans, who are also barred from playing in a bowl game, is a Dec. 4 road contest with crosstown rival UCLA.
But the players insist they don’t view their final stretch as “insignificant.”
“It’s tough. As a competitor, you want to win every game,” redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “It is tough to fight that hard and come out on the losing end, but sometimes you learn more when you lose than when you win.”
Troy is dead! Go Irish!
Yeah, but the luck of Irish won’t help you guys next year.
Gary…HUH? name one.
What did Allen Bradford do that was bad enough to keep him off the field on Senior night?   The running game was so bad but they never even tried him.
Too bad. The crap I have seen at the coliseum over the years I can’t count. USC touchdowns after the back fumbled the ball on the two yard line and was still called a touchdown. Like I said, so much crap I cant count.

USC has always implored students to participate in community outreach, whether through their fraternities or sororities, the Joint Educational Project or any number of other options. Helping the local community is emphasized during admission tours, and it is reinforced repeatedly during a student’s time at USC.
Alice Li| Daily Trojan
But the students aren’t the only ones helping to improve the neighborhood. The university’s active role in the community has helped to advance the area as well.
The USC Family of Schools partnership, started by former President Steven B. Sample in 1994, is the university’s flagship philanthropy organization, designed to provide resources to local public schools.
The partnership originally started with five schools, but it has now expanded to 15 schools and more than 17,000 children. USC students and faculty alike dedicate their time to teach and encourage students in order to help them achieve the main goal of the organization — attending college.
The partnership is one of many that USC has established to improve the University Park area. President C. L. Max Nikias recently visited 10 of the 15 schools in the program to re-evaluate their needs and make sure the university’s resources were being used in the most effective way.
Also of interest to Nikias is the redevelopment of the University Village complex, which will help  create jobs for local residents and increase the university’s role as an economic engine that dominates the local economy.
USC’s role in the community has been publicized and marketed ad nauseam. But this does not downplay the tangible impact that the university has had in the surrounding neighborhoods.
The addition of the Contemporary Services Corporation security officers has improved safety for students and local residents. USC has emphasized the role of education and helped the local public schools in a time of crisis, when even a pencil can’t be taken for granted.
In a time when many schools are shutting down their arts and music programs, USC has helped support the programs in the schools here via student organizations.
By allowing the younger students to access university resources, they have in some ways created a second school for them. And by stressing the importance of education, many local students no longer view college as a long shot. They view it as a necessity.
The economic impact of the university has been equally profound. USC has created 27,000 jobs on campus and thousands more non-university jobs because of the establishment of local businesses designed to serve students. The university also looks  out for local businesses’ interests through the Local Vendor Program, which gives these businesses a chance to be a part of campus projects.
Although USC has done a lot to improve the community for the residents of the area, it can still do more to strengthen the students’ experience. The renovated University Village will help make students feel more involved with the local area as well as to accept and embrace it as opposed to looking down on it.
Similar to Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, Calif., the new University Village will function as a communal gathering place for students. Many students complain about the area immediately outside campus, often calling it rundown. The new University Village will enhance L.A. aesthetically and economically, making the area a selling point and not a drawback.
The economic revenue and overall impact of USC is unrivaled to anything else in the Downtown Los Angeles area. University officials are aware of their relationship to the community and understand its importance, cementing community outreach as a top priority.
By ingraining this philosophy within its students, the university ensures that many different groups affiliated with USC, ranging from the president to the students, do their part to help the community.
The school could have sat back and let the community take shape and adjust accordingly. The proactive stance that university officials have taken, gaining steam with Sample in 1994, created an example that every person affiliated with the university is urged to follow.
Service and outreach are two essential values which USC has highlighted. Students don’t need to look far for an excellent example.

Cancun just expanded beyond drug cartels and MTV spring break.
Monday marked the kick-off of the 16th annual Conference of the Parties, the much-anticipated subset of the United Nation’s Framework Convention on Climate Change. Last year’s COP15 in Copenhagen, Denmark, was wildly unsuccessful, with no international agreement reached and no replacement penned for the soon-to-expire Kyoto Protocol.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Instead, a pledge to try and keep the global climate rise below 2 degrees Celsius, called the Copenhagen Accord, was presented.
Unfortunately, it’s not legally binding, because not one of the delegates representing 192 nations in attendance actually signed it. They did, however, promise that they would “take note” of the Copenhagen Accord, so we can be comforted in that at least their hearts were in the right place.
Perhaps seeking a more casual atmosphere than last year’s tension-filled summit, COP16 has left Copenhagen behind in favor of Cancun, Mexico.
The choice of location is an interesting one. It places COP16 on the doorstep of many of the nations — namely Bolivia — that did the most to stonewall a global mandate in Copenhagen. (It should be noted that Bolivia went on to host The World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth, which discussed the Kyoto Protocol and related topics in response to the outcome of the Copenhagen summit.)
With the an almost-home turf  advantage and an additional year to organize, the question of whether Bolivia will succeed in blocking a global agreement once again and succeed in pushing through aspects of its own agenda is a critical one.
To be fair, Bolivia isn’t determined to keep carbon emissions high — it is concerned that indigenous perspectives are going underrepresented in the current forum of discussion.
Bolivia seems to be on to something.
Last Wednesday, the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action under the Convention — a temporary subsidiary organization of the UNFCC — issued a new proposal, a possible replacement for the Kyoto Protocol, that doesn’t do the underdog nations of the world any favors. It disregards the suggestions of the 35,000-plus delegates at the World People’s Conference, and it also disregards China’s and Bolivia’s requests for flexible funding to accommodate developing nations.
One of the tenets of the UNFCC and the AWG-LCA, aside from a penchant for lengthy names, is that all countries should reduce their emissions equally. This has been met with concern from many of those countries; developing nations, as they undergo the process of industrialization, often require a high level of carbon emissions.
China has been particularly vocal in expressing that requiring developing nations to cut emissions on the same level as fully industrialized countries is unfair — the United States and Western Europe got free rides because they developed before carbon emissions were on the political radar, and a large part of why carbon levels are so high in the first place is because those countries have been pumping it into the atmosphere for more than a century.
China is now saying that it needs assistance in the form of clean technology subsidized by the industrialized world, and that it shouldn’t be prevented from industrializing simply because of bad timing. If enacted, the proposals of the AWG-LCA could deny it that.
The Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. Accordingly, this year’s COP is under greater pressure than last year’s to find a replacement agreement, and there has been a lot of concern that even with the benefits of meeting in Cancun, nothing concrete will be decided until COP17 in South Africa.
But despite the Kyoto Protocol’s looming expiration date, if the AWG-LCA’s proposal is the most viable successor, this might be one of the cases in which no decision is a good decision.
Should Cancun prove nothing more than a Copenhagen 2.0, hopefully one more year will be enough time to gently push AWG-LCA aside and come up with something better.

Actually I think that the UN is wasting its time. It would be much better to spend time, money and effort on problems that are small enough to be solved with current cheap technology. We are in a world wide economic dip. We can’t afford new high maintenance tax and subsidy programs. The UN does not have enough power to change the climate of the planet. The UN does not have enough power to change itself. The diplomats and leaders live the life of the super rich, flying around the world, tasting the best from each country, while most of the countries around the world live in near slave like conditions. Economic prosperity world wide could help the situation. Encouraging private property rights would actually help more people and overtime it may be possible to get to the point where world wide there is enough money and knowledge to change the climate of our planet – regardless of what the sun is doing. Private property is the answer, don’t let governments just take it away and delay sustainability.

November 2012 still seems ages away. But politics is all about speculation, and although President Barack Obama is by no means a shoo-in for the Democratic nominee, at this early time it is much more interesting to discuss the Republican side, where there is obviously no incumbent and no clear frontrunner.
Despite the absence of any favorite, no potential Republican candidate has generated more buzz than Sarah Palin, partly because of the polarizing figure she has proven to be in politics, her reputation as an outsider of the Karl Rove establishment and partly just because of the ambiguity of her presidential goals.
But how likely is it that Palin, former governor of Alaska and running mate to 2008 presidential candidate John McCain, will in the end decide to run for the Republican nomination — and how will she fare if she does take the plunge?
After nearly two years of evading the question, Palin has finally begun to show some decisiveness about whether or not she wants to run for president in 2012. Whereas in the past the question drew indistinct responses from her, such as, “That certainly isn’t on my radar screen right now,” her tone has changed since the midterm elections earlier this month.
At a recent fundraiser in Pennsylvania, Palin slyly asked the young man who sang “God Bless America” before her speech, “Daniel, would you like to sing at an inauguration?” She quickly clarified, “Not necessarily mine,” amid cheers from the crowd, followed by something Palin-esque about being just so proud to be an American.
Perhaps most indicative of Palin’s openness to running were her recent statements published in an interview with Robert Draper in The New York Times.
When asked if she is weighing a run for president, Palin answered, “I’m engaged in the internal deliberations, candidly, and having that discussion with my family, because my family is the most important consideration here.”
Illuminating as that statement is, Palin has also recently remarked that her decision would include “getting a good lay of the landscape, too, the political landscape, because I’d be in it to win it.”
In other words, she’ll run if she thinks she can win.
This political landscape Palin would be looking at in order to win could include a variety of scenarios: a highly unpopular Obama and Democratic party; a bid for the Democratic nomination by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; a surprise run by multi-billionaire New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg as an Independent (which he considered in 2008, and which the Obama administration is reportedly concerned about for 2010); or any combination of these events.
For those who would be quick to dismiss Palin’s viability as a general election candidate, citing the intense opposition coming from the Republican establishment, her gaping lack of credentials, newcomer status and style of speech that is as lacking in substance as it is uplifting in spirit, I would advise another look.
Do these repudiations (or refudiations, as Palin might say) sound familiar? They should. These are, point-for-point the same criticisms leveled against Obama as he began his bid for president — and we all know how that turned out.
Indeed, the circumstances credited for allowing an inexperienced outsider like Obama to be elected — a highly unpopular incumbent administration led by the other party, a desperately ill economy and a general disillusionment with politicians and the direction of the country — might be as present for Palin in 2012 as they were for Obama in 2008. That should be a scary thought for those who don’t want to see Obama become a one-term president.
Of course, this is all still premature. It’s not uncommon for presidents to struggle with low approval ratings after their first two years in office, in which much political capital is spent to accomplish the more controversial agenda items, and in which Congress is the focus of re-election efforts.
Nevertheless, Obama’s popularity is declining in ways few could have imagined just a year or two ago, and it is possible that if this persists Palin might find reason, rightfully or not, to believe that she has a fighting chance.
In her acceptance speech as Republican vice presidential nominee in 2008, Palin had this to say about then-nominee Obama: “When the cloud of rhetoric has passed, when the roar of the crowd fades away, what exactly is our opponent’s plan?”
Perhaps Palin will be hit with the same question two years from now, in a place much like the one Obama stood in two years ago.
Justin Davidoff is an undeclared sophomore.
The half term governor is a “Dan Quayle” in heels. Since we already had an idiot “W” that caused our current economic debacle, America knows not to trust in fools who think they are brilliant. One of the reason for “W” failure was his drinking, Palin just has bad genes.
wow, this really IS a right-wing scrapsheet . . .
What do you mean?  The article does not support Palin, it just says that she might think about running for certain reasons.  Or maybe you are talking about the pro-Palin comments…
Can you be more clear when leveling criticisms?
trojan conservative assholes
Oh, she’ll run. And she’ll win. Who’s going to beat her? Obama?
I’m not much of a Palin fan, but I think its a fair assessment… I didn’t realize she was this serious about running.
Also, thannk you author for not being a Palin cheerleader or hater!- seems these days that everyone has to be one or the other.  The unbiased view is very refreshing.  
Great article overall.
Who could possibly want 4 more years with another Obama administration?
Talk about being a “polarizing figure”, Obama should go back to being a pompous university professor…in Cuba. Palin stands for what the majority of Americans want…forget the college crowd~they’re still in their evolutionary “dream world” of academia.
Once you evolve into the Real World, you’ll see that important things like Family, Faith, & Flag actually do matter and are worth dying for.
How many of the 300 million people in the USA look at the president as the author of their future well being?
Palin saw Obama clearly in 2008 and since that day, when she made that speech, millions of others have had the same question about Obama.  
Especially those who voted for him.
Since Obama has put much of his plan on the table, people are running away in a panic because there is nothing good on the horizon with the Obama Plan…unless you are Obama.  
O is having a great time being President while the nation suffers under an economic crisis he and his friends created, and then he made much worse with his directives to Congress.
I said over two years ago,  and I still believe…that if Obama was elected President, people who made fun of Sarah Palin would be running to support her for the next President.
She is the only one who sees Obama for who he is, and she is the only one who had a better plan for this country way back in 2008.  McCain’s strategists would not let her run with it and stiffled her.  The media attacked her, along with Obama’s Organizing for American paid supporters who run to attack every time there is an article or message about her.
In the long run…Palin is the stronger person who does have the best interest of the American people as her goal.  
A self interested O vs. an America interested Palin…we have two years to find out how strong or weak this country will be in standing up for itself by correcting our government back to one that is for, by and of The People.
Run Sarah Run !

Various technical problems occured during the show, which are rumored to have caused the opening to be pushed back from its original December date to a January. During the show, some of the wires used for special effects instead became a huge burden, entangling the actors involved.
The musical sounds a little ambitious and quite adventurous, with an approximate running time of nearly four hours, musical accompaniment from the genius of Bono and The Edge and most importantly a whopping $65 million budget – enough to put it in the top spot in the list of the most expensive Broadway productions.
The show’s already got quite a lot of attention but the only way to keep up the good energy is to tune up those spidey senses.

The men’s water polo team won the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) Championship with an 8-7 sudden-death victory over No. 4 seeded Stanford on Sunday, netting the Trojans an automatic bid into the upcoming four-team NCAA tournament.
The marathon win spanned four quarters, two overtime periods, and one sudden death period before freshman Nikola Vavic scored with 2:03 remaining in the second portion of sudden death to clinch the Trojans’ seventh MPSF tournament title.
Peter Kurzeka and Matt Burton each scored two goals in the championship match, while goalie Joel Dennerley paced the men of Troy with 12 saves.
The win avenges a 5-3 loss that the Trojans suffered to the Cardinal during the regular season. Both games took place at the Avery Aquatic Center in Palo Alto, Stanford’s home pool.
Now, the Trojans (26-2) will try to defend their back-to-back national titles as the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, jumping up in the rankings after former No. 1 California’s loss to Stanford in the MPSF semifinals. The Trojans now hold an 11-match winning streak since their 2-match skid in October.
They will face No. 4 seeded St. Francis (NY) in the first round, who hold a 24-3 record as the winners of the Eastern Championship. On the other side of the bracket, California (23-3) will face No. 3 seeded Loyola Marymount (19-8), champions of the Western Water Polo Association.
The first round matchups will take place on December 4, while the championship and consolation game will follow on December 5. All matches will take place at Spieker Aquatics Complex in Berkeley, CA.

Surely the news can’t be serious. Sadly, it is. And don’t call me Shirley.
Leslie Nielsen, the comedy great behind movies such as Airplane!, The Naked Gun and Dracula: Dead and Loving It, died on Sunday of pneumonia.
The Canadian actor got his start in the 1950s, with his first major role in 1956’s The Forbidden Planet. He continued playing serious roles throughout the 1970s, including the ship’s captain in the original Poseidon Adventure.
But everything changed with 1980’s comedy Airplane!. Nielsen was the go-to comedy actor, able to bring a serious deadpan to even the most absurd of scenes. He became known for his work in spoofs, like 1998’s Fugitive-parody Wrongly Accused.
To younger audiences, he’s probably best remembered as the titular Mr. Magoo in the ’90s version of the cartoon.
Nielsen was taken to a hospital – a big building with patients, but that’s not important right now – on Nov. 20, but his condition did not get better.
The world is a less funny place with him gone.

A freshman died Wednesday night after Department of Public Safety officials found her unresponsive and not breathing in her dorm room, officials said.
DPS officers responded to the room of Rachel Kim, who lived on the sixth floor of Pardee Tower, after receiving a call at 8:41 p.m, said DPS Capt. David Carlisle.
“The Los Angeles City Fire Department Unit 15 was also notified and responded to the scene,” Carlisle said. “[Kim] was transported to California Hospital and was later pronounced dead.”
The cause of death has not yet been released. Carlisle said privacy rules prevented him from giving more information.
A counseling session will be held on Thursday at 7 p.m. for residents of the sixth floor of Pardee; another session will be held at 8 p.m. in the Pardee Tower second floor lobby for all Pardee residents, Michael L. Jackson, vice president of Student Affairs wrote in an e-mail to Pardee residents.
“Our hearts and prayers go out to Rachel’s family and friends,” Jackson said.
For immediate support, students can contact DPS dispatch at (213) 740-6000 to speak with a counselor.
Rachel was a much loved person to all of us who knew her. She had an amazing personality and would light up a room when entering it. It’s so overwhelming to read this article and more overwhelming to know of her loving parents loss. Rachel had such an awesome future ahead of her. She made people feel great when around her and she is already missed by hundreds of friends back here in Maryland. Please remember her well. Make her proud and know that while she was only at USC a short time… she would have blown you away with her talent, wisdom and personality!! She will forever be remembered by all of us.  Especially those who had the opportunity to grow up with her.  Much love to each of you who share this great loss! Love – A parent who watched her grow in to an amazing young lady!
RIP Rachel Kim
