Former USC hurdler Paul Kerry, the 1965 NCAA Champion in the 120-yard hurdles, died on Oct. 6 after an extended illness, the university  announced Tuesday.

Kerry, who lettered at USC from 1964-67, took the 1965 NCAA high hurdles title with a time of 13.7 seconds. The two-time All-American was a key component of USC’s 1965 and 1967 NCAA track and field championship teams.
His 13.7-second mark in the 120-yard high hurdles, which is now a 110-meter race, is ranked sixth all-time by a Trojan.
Kerry is also in the books with his 52.1-second finish in the 440-yard intermediate hurdles, good for seventh all-time by a Trojan.
Kerry, who was born in Ardmore, Okla., competed in track and field and set multiple records at Washington High in Los Angeles before attending USC on a four-year track and field scholarship. He earned a bachelor’s degree in physical education and history and a general secondary teaching credential at USC.
After his collegiate career, Kerry taught at John Muir Junior High School in Pasadena and later at Santa Monica High in 1969 as a social studies teacher and track and field coach.
Between 1975 and 1985, Kerry modeled in the summers, working for Nina Blanchard, Mary Davis Webb and the Ford Agency.
Kerry also traveled around the world to help educate athletes and coaches in Sweden, Finland, Papua New Guinea, Brisbane and Norway and received a nomination as Teacher of the Year from the NFL for his work.
Paul was a great man of his times, he had it all…charm, wit, brawn, and brains. He will be missed

Last year, the Trojans posted signs all around Heritage Hall, proclaiming their mantra: “That’s our ball!”
And yet, for the past several years, the Trojan defense has been subpar in forcing turnovers.
The Trojans ranked 90th nationally in 2011 with just 1.4 takeaways per game (for an embarrassing comparison, UCLA averaged 1.5). The 2010 team fared only slightly better, with just 1.9 takeaways per game.
Turnovers · Senior safety T.J. McDonald and the Trojan defense rank No. 11 in the country in turnovers forced per game at 2.7. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Compare that to the Trojans’ run of success under Uncle Pete. 2003: 3.2 takeaways per game, Rose Bowl winners and split national champions. 2004: 2.9 takeaways per game, National champions. 2005: 2.9 takeaways per game, national runner-up.
The takeaway: takeaways matter. And this year’s Trojan defense is showing that. USC sits at 11th nationally with 2.7 takeaways per game, close to double last season’s average.
“It’s just a more experienced defense than a couple years ago,” senior safety Jawanza Starling said after the Trojans’ victory in Seattle on Saturday. “We’ve been in the system for a while and guys know what they’re supposed to do.”
Indeed, every one of USC’s starting linebackers and defensive backs has at least one full year of starts under his belt. And those “newcomers,” the USC defensive line? Well, their 22 sacks are the fifth-most nationally, and the pressure they generate has certainly played an impact on several of the Trojans’ 11 interceptions this season.
Think about the critical moments of USC’s games this season. Senior safety T.J. McDonald’s interception in the red zone against Cal with the Bears driving, down by just eight point. Junior cornerback Nickell Robey’s forced fumble against Utah, which allowed the Trojans to come back from 14 down and take a lead they did not relinquish.
And then there was the fourth quarter of Saturday’s game with Washington, down just 10 points, drove down the field with all the momentum on their side. Then, on second and goal from the USC three-yard line, Starling knocked the ball out of Washington quarterback Keith Price’s hands and fell on it. Just like that, the Huskies’ momentum was gone.
Though lacking the same level of drama, it was nonetheless reminiscent of Starling’s game-changing — and arguably season-altering — 97-yard fumble return touchdown at Notre Dame last season (even if Starling won’t admit it).
“That fumble [at Notre Dame] was a sparkplug for the whole season,” Starling said after the game in Seattle. “[The one today] was a sparkplug for just this game.”
Last year, the Trojan defense forced nine interceptions and recovered eight fumbles for a total of 17 takeaways over 12 games. Over their first six games this year, they have already forced 11 interceptions and recovered five fumbles for a total of 16 takeaways. Halfway through the season, the Trojans are on pace for twice as many takeaways as last year.
“That’s an experienced group,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin of his defense after practice on Tuesday. “Between Jawanza, T.J. and Nickell, they’ve been responsible for some huge plays for us.”
The linebackers have been predictably strong as well, making the Trojan’s back seven fierce. Sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey, a converted defensive back, leads the team in interceptions with four. But perhaps the biggest difference this year is in their defensive line.
True freshman Leonard Williams and junior transfer Morgan Breslin have combined for 12.5 sacks this year. Breslin’s seven sacks place him 11th nationally. The Trojans came up with 31 sacks last season and are on pace for 44 this year.
“We’ve added two big pass rushers,” Kiffin said of the pair. “Leonard [Williams] has made a huge impact on the inside for us.”
In addition to pressuring the opposing quarterback into interceptions, the defensive line has forced two of the five fumbles and recovered four of them.
Everyone thought it would be the Trojan offense who would lead this team by putting up 40 points a game and throwing for five touchdowns. But while the offense sputters trying to find its rhythm, the Trojan defense has emerged as the squad’s dominant unit.

Even though No. 10 USC is playing one-win Colorado team on Saturday, it stepped up its intensity in Tuesday’s practice.
“We probably had our most physical practice that we’ve had all season right now,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We have a lot of work to do. We really challenged them and they responded this morning.”

USC is looking forward to playing in the Coliseum this weekend, as it is currently only one of two teams nationally to have played just two home games this season.
“We’re excited to come back to L.A.,” Kiffin said. “It’s a sold-out crowd on Saturday, we’ll have great energy in the Coliseum.”
Junior wide receiver Robert Woods agreed with the sentiment that a game at the Coliseum will be welcomed.
“I’m excited to play at home,” Woods said. “We finally get cheers instead of boos.”
There were a couple position battles that took center stage Tuesday. Along with rotating several players for the second starting cornerback spot, Kiffin announced that freshman Max Tuerk took reps with the first-team offense at left tackle, rotating with sophomore Aundrey Walker. Walker has been the most penalized Trojan in 2012, leaving the competition open for another week.
Another major problem for USC thus far has been their poor play on third down. USC’s third down conversion rate stands at 30.1 percent, the fifth worst percentage in the country.
—
“We haven’t made the plays when they’ve been there,” Kiffin said. “We’re missing calls on some protections. But, coming home should help.”
Senior quarterback Matt Barkley believes Trojan miscues have led to the poor percentage.
“A lot of the penalties have killed us,” Barkley said. “Whether it’s false starts on third and short or third and long situations.”
In other Trojan news, Woods is only four catches shy of breaking the school record for receptions, held by former wideout Dwayne Jarrett. In all likelihood, he will break that record Saturday against the Buffaloes.
“It would mean a lot to me,” Woods said. “Growing up watching all of the USC receivers … to be on the top of the list would be an honor and privilege.”

USC junior Kaitlyn Christian and sophomore Sabrina Santamaria notched their third major doubles championship together after claiming the Rivera/ITA All-American Doubles championship for the first time in USC women’s tennis history.
The No. 1 pair in the ITA rankings took down Duke’s Beatrice Capra and Hanna Mar in the finals 6-2, 6-7(6), 6-3 at the Riviera Tennis Club in Pacific Palisades, Calif. on Oct. 7.

After a back-and-forth battle in the first two sets, Christian and Santamaria found themselves tied with the Duke team that had upset No. 3 seed California.
“We didn’t take them lightly,” Christian said. “We both know them from juniors. We respected them and went out there and played our own game.”
Christian and Santamaria pulled ahead to a quick 4-2 lead in the third set and finished off Capra and Mar to claim yet another major doubles crown.
“The biggest thing was reenergizing ourselves and regrouping,” Santamaria said. “Just telling ourselves to play one percent better and that we would get them in the third set.” Before the finals, Christian and Santamaria cruised through three rounds of play after a first round bye.
After defeating a pair from Oklahoma State and another from Illinois both — to the tune of 8-4 — Christian and Santamaria then ousted No. 4-seed, UCLA’s Robin Anderson and Skylar Morton 6-2, 6-2, in the semifinals.
“It was just a combination of us playing really well and concentrating really well,” Santamaria said. “I think the energy was just the biggest factor for us.”
Christian and Santamaria’s doubles accolades include the 2012 Pac-12 Doubles Championship and the 2011 ITA National Indoor Doubles Championship. The two finished the 2011-12 season ranked No. 3.
“We complement each other really well. We’ve been playing together for seven years, so we really know each other’s game styles well,” Christian said.
In the singles draw of the All-Americans, USC also saw two of its players reach the final four.
Sophomore Zoë Scandalis and senior Danielle Lao, ranked No. 7 and No. 11 in the nation, respectively, pushed to the semifinals on Oct. 6 but both fell in straight sets to their opponents.
Christian and Santamaria, who were named the USC Student-Athletes of the Week last week, entered this year ranked No. 1 in the Campbell/ITA Preseason Women’s Doubles rankings.
“Last year, we lost in the first round in the NCAAs. We won indoors, and we play indoors again in two weeks so we want to recapture that title,” Christian said. “We’re hoping to get that title and the NCAA championship at the end of the year.”
The two are also ranked in singles, with Santamaria standing at No. 8 and Christian at No. 54. The next round of rankings, which will include USC’s team ranking, will be released on Jan. 3.
USC will continue its preseason tournament schedule with the ITA Southwest Regionals, which begins on Thursday and runs through Monday, in San Diego, Calif.

Gadadhara Pandit Dasa, the first ever Hindu Chaplain for Columbia University and New York University, compared The Matrix, a 1999 film about a man who discovers that he is living in a computer program, with Bhagavad Gita, a foundational sacred Hindu text.
Religion · Gadadhara Pandit Dasa, a Hindu chaplain, explains connections between Bhagavad Gita, a sacred Hindu text, and The Matrix. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni opened the event in the Tutor Campus Center on Tuesday, which was hosted by USC’s Office of Religious Life and the Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics, with a brief introduction of The Matrix, one of the most overtly philosophical films to ever come out of Hollywood. He explained that Neo, the film’s protagonist, represents the “liberated one.”
The talk included a combination of clips from the film followed by discussions.
Pandit connected Hindu theology with Neo’s belief that there is something missing in the world and the film’s depiction of characters entering the alternate reality through sleep.
“Within the Hindu tradition, it is understood that we are partially asleep,” Pandit said. “There’s a certain part of us that’s actually still asleep. The goal of human life is to wake up out of that slumber. Somehow, we’re not conscious of everything that’s going on.”
Pandit also focused on the dialogue between Neo and another character, Trinity. He emphasized Trinity’s remarks to Neo that “it’s the question that drives us,” and “it’ll find you if you want it to.”
Pandit said that for humanity, there are certain questions that are always driving us. He then led a discussion, asking students in the audience if there are certain questions they reflect on.
Students answered with questions such as, “what is my purpose,” “what is love” and “what makes the struggle worth it?”
Pandit also made a direct comparison between the struggles of Neo and Arjuna, a character in the Bhagavad Gita, who has a panic attack and is unable to undertake the duty he has been waiting to perform for 13 years. His dilemma is whether to fight or not fight in a battle. Pandit said humans must first have a high degree of self-awareness before making choices to act.
“We can’t ever stop asking these questions,” Pandit said. “It’s our goal to try as hard as possible to address some if not all of these questions.”
Pandit also said that oftentimes, humans give up because they think these questions are beyond understanding, but claimed that answers always exist.
“If we really want the answer, it’ll find its way into our life, but we have to be looking for it,” Pandit said.
Divakar Singamsetty, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering, said she found his presentation to illuminate religious undertones within the film.
“Gadadhara Pandit’s connections between the Bhagavad Gita and The Matrix, and the hidden spiritual aspects of the film were very intriguing,” Singamsetty said.

Neal Millard, a former adjunct professor of international finance at the USC Gould School of Law, was appointed Monday to the Board of Directors of The Music Center, a renowned performing arts center in Los Angeles. Millard joins fellow new directors David Gindler, Joyce Hameetman, Joseph Rice and Carla Sands at The Music Center.
A partner of California business law firm Musick, Peeler & Garrett, LLP, Millard is currently an attorney representing USC Hybrid High, a charter school in Downtown Los Angeles linked to the USC Rossier School of Education.
Though he last taught at USC in 2008 and returns upon teaching requests, Millard still treasures the Trojan connection.
“One of the things I hope to do as a board member is to help work with the education committee to spread fine arts to local high schools and middle schools, one of which will be USC Hybrid High since they’re right in Downtown and can easily walk to the Music Center,” he said. “I’ve been talking to Dean Gallagher [of Rossier] and have been working on perhaps having USC Hybrid High participate in some Music Center events.”
Law and finance might not have an apparent link to the fine arts, but Millard said he finds joy in both.
“My interest in the arts, the reason why I’m serving on the board, was that I’ve always been interested in theatre. I’ve been a season-holder to the Ahmanson since the 1970s. I enjoy concerts, theaters, opera,” he said.
Millard will be serving a four-year term on the board, working to strengthen the Music Center’s connection with education.

Former USC Trustee and businessman Alex Cappello urged student involvement and emphasized the importance of reputation Tuesday at an event in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Life advice · “Your integrity is the most valuable asset you have,” said former USC Trustee Alex Cappello at an event Tuesday. – Alex Rose | Daily Trojan
Cappello gave students advice on how to succeed and best use their time at USC during “How to Maximize Your Potential,” an event sponsored by the Trojan Scholars Society.
Cappello graduated from USC’s Marshall School of Business in the ’70s and has worked at several large companies, including The Cheesecake Factory, Inc., California Republic Bank, Geothermal Resources Intl. and Koo Koo Roo, Inc.  He now works solely for his own company, Cappello Capital Corp., an investment bank that does business in more than 50  countries with offices in 11 cities.
Cappello has also served as president of the USC Alumni Association.
Throughout the presentation Cappello stressed integrity as the most important quality one can possess.
“Your integrity is the most valuable asset you can have. … If you lose your integrity, you lose your reputation, you have lost everything forever,” Cappello said.
After asking all students in the audience to introduce themselves with their name, grade, major, hometown and professional goals, Cappello spoke about his own time at USC.
Cappello ran track at USC, but stopped at his doctor’s recommendation and threw himself into other activities. In addition to advising businesses on investments and advising students on how to present themselves to employers, Cappello was Interfraternity Council President.
“Every service group I could be a part of, I did,” Cappello said.
He also advised students to remember that the purpose of college is academic growth.
“I loved my social life in college, but that’s not why I was here, I was here to learn,” Cappello said.
Though his journey has not been the easiest, in part due to a degenerative spine disease that leaves him constantly in pain, Cappello urged students to appreciate life.
“I want to kiss my two daughters and my wife every morning, I want to breathe fresh air, I want to feel sunshine on my face,” Cappello said. “I’m so grateful for life.”
The event was exclusively for members of the Trojan Scholars Society — students who are the recipients of Mork, Trustee and Presidential scholarships. About 40 students of all grades and majors attended the presentation.
Jerry Ting, president of the Trojan Scholars Society who helped plan the event, said the choice of Cappello was unconventional for the group.
“Traditionally our scholarship society has been very diverse in its events that it puts on, but this year we’re focusing very specifically on trying to bring professional speakers and offering professional advice,” Ting said.
Kiersten Stanley, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television, found Cappello to be a compelling speaker.
“This was a really good event for the Trojan Scholars Society to host … Mr. Cappello’s advice about meeting people and branching outside of your comfort zone is very useful,” Stanley said.
Vivian Rotenstein, a freshman majoring in cognitive science, said the event was informative for students, regardless of what subjects they are studying in the classroom.
“Even though I’m not a business major [and business is what] this particular speaker devoted his life to, I think he provided a lot of life lessons and really good insight,” Rotenstein said.

Though USC football was ineligible for a bowl game during the 2011-12 academic year as the result of NCAA sanctions, it didn’t stop the school from hauling in record athletic-related revenue.
According to documents filed with the U.S. Department of Education earlier this week, the university reported a record $84.19 million in revenue, nearly $10 million more than the previous year. USC reported $75.7 million for all athletic-related revenue or 2010-11.
The Orange County Register first reported the story Monday night.
Postsecondary co-educational institutions that participate in Title IV are required to file an annual report with the Department of Education regarding expenses and revenues for all athletic teams.
Nonetheless, USC, though on its second year of probation, reported $34.4 million in football-revenue for 2011-2012, according to the Register, an increase in about $3 million. The program reported $23.1 million in expenses for football.
USC Senior Associate Athletic Director Steve Lopes told the newspaper that ticket sales and donations were up. Lopes also credited the fact that USC played seven home football games in 2011. The school, as is the case this season, typically plays just six at the Coliseum.

Students watched President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney face off in the volatile second presidential debate Tuesday night at an event hosted by the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and sponsored by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
Analyze this · Panelists Max Schwartz (left), a member of the USC College Democrats, and Jim Brulte, former California State Senate and Assembly Republican Leader, discuss the debate. – Alec Faulkner | Daily Trojan
The debate aired live from Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. Moderated by CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, the evening’s debate covered topics ranging from domestic policies to the attack in Libya.
Unlike the previous debates this election cycle, the second debate took the form of a town hall meeting in which citizens were able to pose questions to the presidential candidates on foreign and domestic issues. The audience was composed of undecided voters, 60 percent of whom did not approve of the current health of the economy.
Both Democratic and Republican voters anxiously anticipated the quality of performances by both candidates. Obama’s campaign promised a more energized and aggressive attack following his lackluster performance during the first debate.
The combative dialogue between Romney and Obama on the Republican candidate’s ties to big business was one hallmark of the difference in performance.
“And when I hear Governor Romney say he’s a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when — Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ‘This plant kills,’ and took great pride in shutting it down,” Obama said. “And now suddenly you’re a big champion of coal.”
Later, Romney volleyed back, attacking Obama’s term as president.
“I think you know better,” Romney said. “I think you know that these last four years haven’t been so good as the president just described and that you don’t feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.”
Based on the student audience’s responses, the candidates followed through on promises to be more engaged in this debate. To Austin Reagan, a freshman majoring in political science, Obama’s performance increased substantially from the first debate.
“I would be the first to admit that I thought Romney did very well in the first debate,” Reagan said. “But I’m also the first to admit that I thought he did really poorly this time.”
Despite Romney’s increased approval, which placed him in a dead heat with the President according to most polls, the panelists said they thought the President made a  comeback.
The panel, which the Unruh Institute’s director Dan Schnur moderated after the debate, discussed the stark contrast between the performance of both candidates between the first and second debates.
Garry South, a senior democratic strategist and former senior advisor to California Governor Gray Davis, noted how Obama learned his lesson from the first debate.
“What happened tonight is that Barack Obama actually showed up,” South said. “A different Obama showed up.”
Jim Brulte, a former California State Senate and Assembly Republican Leader, agreed with his fellow panelists regarding Obama’s performance.
“Barack Obama reinvigorated his base,” said Brulte. “I thought where in the first debate where Mitt Romney had won, I thought it was relatively clear that Barack Obama won this debate.”
Not all attendees were as impressed with the President’s performance. Alexis Miller, a freshman majoring in interactive media, thought Obama performed better, but believed that both candidates could stand to improve.
“I felt like both candidates didn’t articulate very well, and there were a lot of pseudo-facts and flip-flopping,” Miller said. “That might just be a characteristic of politics.”
One of the main aspects that resonated with the panelists was the more aggressive nature of the night’s debate, particularly regarding the attacks in Libya.
To close the panel discussion, Schnur highlighted how the debates are ultimately watched to see the candidates perform unscripted.
“This is one of the rare occasions where you get to see the candidates unscripted,” said Schnur. “To see them under times of unanticipated questions and unanticipated circumstances.”
The Unruh Institute will host a screening of the third and final presidential debate on Monday at 6 p.m. in the USC Annenberg East Lobby.

October is here, welcoming the beginning of the most important phase in video game merchandising: the fourth quarter. Consisting of the October, November and December months, the fourth quarter generally sees the release of some of the most successful and entertaining games of the year.
This year’s fourth quarter looks particularly promising, with this month supplying gamers with a few big-budget blockbusters to entertain them for hours on end.
Gamers never say no to the productions of powerhouse Bethesda Softworks, responsible for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. Bethesda’s newest release comes in the form of Dishonored, a first-person, stealth-based, role-playing game.
Set in the futuristic, dystopian city of Dunwall, Dishonored follows the story of Corvo Attano. Formerly a bodyguard, Attano was unjustly framed for the murder of the Empress he was hired to protect. He vows vengeance on those who have wronged him. As he sets out on his mission, Attano is aided by magical powers and abilities — such as teleportation and possession — that transform him into a silent yet powerful harbinger of death.
What makes Dishonored exceptional is its role-playing elements. The player’s moral and ethical choices affect the mission parameters and events, which can be completed in ways other than just killing everything in your path. Sneaking, hacking and evading are other strategic choices of the player, giving him or her the ability to complete missions in anyway he or she might choose.
Brutally murdering targets and destroying environments will cumulatively add to the game’s “chaos” meter. Depending on the length of the chaos meter, Dunwall will progressively deteriorate, bringing forth plagued rats and eroding buildings that the player must react to.
Because of its array of features and flexibility, Dishonored, which was released on Oct. 9, carries the potential to be a truly unique experience.
Other acclaimed games that have already been released in North America include Resident Evil 6 and NBA 2K13, both of which received an 8.75/10 rating in gameinformer magazine.
The sixth installment in the historical and critically acclaimed Resident Evil series puts players in the shoes of several protagonists, including Chris Redfield and Leon Kennedy from previous games. Similar to other installments, the game consists of facing endless onslaughts of infected zombies in order to save the world from the spread of the newly manufactured C-virus. With frequent allusions to its predecessors, Resident Evil 6’s essence of nostalgia is sure to please die-hard fans of the series.
If killing zombies isn’t your choice of video game fare, then perhaps knocking down 3-pointers as Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant will  cater more to your tastes. Following its predecessor’s success, NBA 2K13 boasts several new features to enhance its dynamic experience. In response to user demand, NBA 2K13 sports the 1992 and 2012 Olympic men’s basketball teams, both available to play as the game’s Play Now feature. In addition, the single-player career mode has become more interactive, allowing players to choose their character’s pre-game rituals and social acts. Along with this, the game’s graphical interface and animations have been ramped up, providing a more realistic feel for the game. NBA 2K13 is a slam dunk in the hands of sports fans and is available at most retailers.
But the biggest release of the month — if not the year — appears in the form of Assassin’s Creed III. Ubisoft’s powerhouse is back with its yearly installment in the Assassin’s Creed series, this time setting the game’s events during the American Revolutionary War.
Protagonist Desmond Miles assists in the war between the Assassins and the Templars by traveling into the memories of his past ancestor: a half-English, half-Native American colonist named Connor Kenway.
In the most interactive game of the series, players are able to explore countless miles of the American Frontier, including notable sites such as the cities of New York and Boston, Native American tribes, desolate forests and the colonial coastline.
What truly stands out, however, is Assassin’s Creed III’s realistic environment. The landscape changes with the season, boasting snowy forests and frozen rivers during times of winter. The unsettled Frontier bursts with wildlife, such as wolves, deer and bears, providing players with the option to hunt such game — if they choose.
Trees are now fully traversable, allowing Connor to swing from branch to branch with ease and to navigate canopies to spring upon unsuspecting redcoats. Along with Connor’s packed arsenal of arms and gadgets, the player now has the ability to dual-wield weapons, such as muskets and tomahawks, boasting many new, “wow”-generating kill animations.
Assassin’s Creed III has the potential to be the best in the series and is available Oct. 30.
With November and the release of Halo 4 just around the corner, October is set to be an outstanding month for game releases, starting this year’s fourth quarter off with a bang.
Out of all of those, Dishonored is definitely the title I’m most excited about. I’m trying to temper that excitement though. Some previous highly hyped/anticipated games (like Deus Ex: Human Revolution) have left me a bit cynical, and I try not to get my hopes up too high. These days I follow some advice I got from one of my coworkers at DISH and I don’t buy a game until after I’ve rented it and had a chance to log at least a handful of hours on it. It’s saved me a good deal of money in the past six months or so. So Dishonored is already in my Blockbuster @Home queue, and I’ll get to play it soon; I’m still busy with Borderlands 2 anyway.

One of my really good friends insists that I go see Paranormal Activity 4 with him. We’ve seen the first three together, so he’s calling it a tradition.
I hate our tradition. I’m horrible in horror films: I get really jumpy, I scream and I yell. I’m that girl who can’t keep her sh-t together. It’s embarrassing, and I know this will be the case when I see the fourth Paranormal installment.
Still, I can’t help but be a little pissed. If I’m going to be scared, I want it to be done right. The Paranormal series is not the answer to that plea. The found footage here feels tired and redundant as it’s going into its fourth edition, making me wonder if found footage is a lost cinematic device or if it just isn’t working for Paranormal anymore.
Backtrack: Let’s first clarify what found footage is. Found footage uses film “shot” by characters to make the story seem more realistic. These films are often made to look like home video, implying that what they’re shooting is real and could actually happen. This proves especially useful in horror films trying to convince the audience that hauntings and demons and ghosts (oh my!) actually exist. Oftentimes, the “filmmaker” is dead or missing by the end, the footage being all that’s left.
The genre was largely popularized with 1999’s The Blair Witch Project (although found footage has at least been around since 1980’s Cannibal Holocaust — a real film, I swear). Since Blair Witch’s release, there has been an explosion of horror films using found footage: August Underground, Alone with Her, Cloverfield and Quarantine, to name a few.
The two cases that I find most interesting and relevant are the Paranormal series and — though not a horror film — the current release  End of Watch. The films are incredibly different in their use of found footage, and it’s these differences that illustrate what works and what doesn’t with the technique.
The Paranormal series follows a simple premise: Freaky events have been going on in a house and a character sets up cameras to document them. The film takes the viewer through night one, night two, night three — sometimes skipping a few days and often using time-lapse — to spook the viewer through realism.
The first go-round was a surprising smash-hit. The setup — documenting the freaky events that escalate with each night — was a new and interesting concept back in 2007. Five years later, with Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman’s Paranormal Activity 4 hitting theaters, we get it already.
The whole premise feels like a gimmick at this point. We’ll see a character explaining why they’re shooting (unexplained events, potential robbers, home videos) and we know what we’re in for. The fourth film, featuring a girl on video chat, feels like a good idea that’s been done to death. The series is simply repeating a tactic that worked before, but doesn’t anymore.
This does not mean, however, that the technique as a whole is a gimmick. When used organically, found footage enhances a film and makes it feel more realistic, as in the case of David Ayer’s End of Watch.
The film follows two South Los Angeles cops on patrol, Brian (Jake Gyllenhall) and Mike (Michael Peña). Brian studies law in his free time and has to take an art credit to fulfill his requirements. He decides to take filmmaking — a detail that is mentioned in passing and not blatantly set up — so he and his partner wear cameras on their uniform while on the job.
The film cuts between Brian and Mike’s footage, tapes from the cop car and a good number of shots from the real filmmakers. End of Watch weaves these shots together organically. It has a realistic look, but still tells a cohesive story without feeling repetitive, making the cop drama feel all the more authentic. And because it steps away from the horror genre that largely popularized the cinematic device, its approach to found footage feels all the more fresh and exciting.
By making his film look real, Ayer wants you to believe that this is really what patrol is like — though the banter between officers does help. In the same vein, the Paranormal series tries to convince the audience that demons and hauntings really do exist by filming scenes realistically. Both have the look, but the prior works organically, and the latter feels like a blatant set up.
End of Watch demonstrates that found footage can be applied to other genres, rejuvenating the realistic-looking approach within a new context, but this does not mean that horror film has lost hope. The Paranormal franchise doesn’t work because the idea has been worn out within these specific films.
A film like Sinister, by contrast, incorporates home video in moderation. Sinister doesn’t rely on the technique, but instead uses found footage when it can scare most effectively. I haven’t seen the film personally, but I’ve seen the red band trailer and to say that alone is terrifying would be an understatement.
Found footage works best when applied to fresh ideas, whether with different genres or something that hasn’t been done before.
The idea is rather simple: Found footage is only a gimmick when it’s exploited. When used organically, it can be a great tool to lend an air of realism.
End of Watch delivers a fresh approach to found footage. Horror films can still use the genre too, but — it can’t be said enough — it needs to feel organic.
So please, no more Paranormal Activity installments. I don’t want my friend to drag me to the fifth, sixth and seventh films. If you can’t deliver the scares, fine by me, but at least deliver the thrills. Tapping into genres other than horror might just be the way to do that.
 
C. Molly Smith is a junior majoring in communication. Her column “Keepin’ it Reel” runs Wednesdays. 
Yes, I think we can move on from the Paranormal Activity series.
There’s so much more out there within this genre alone!

Andrea Arnold’s Wuthering Heights, the classic novel’s latest film adaptation, is not Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights, nor does it claim to be. It is not William Wyler’s Wuthering Heights, the film which starred legends of the stage and screen like Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. And it is not at all similar to the last feature film adaptation, Peter Kosminsky’s Wuthering Heights, which starred Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche.

Arnold’s version is something else entirely. It begins with an angry boy banging his head on a wall and ends with a Mumford & Sons song.
This film is bare bones, using its visuals to encourage impressions and feelings. It focuses more on a seemingly trivial crude painting on a wall or a moment of meditation in nature more so than on the décor of a house or the style of a dress. In fact, Arnold transforms the imposing Gothic edifice of Bronte’s imagination into a dilapidated hilltop farm. It is atmospheric rather than melodramatic, bleaker and more brutal than all previous adaptations in which a swooning heroine and a brooding hero were enough.
“It’s quite mad, doing something like this, but in a way it was very liberating because I couldn’t do anything madder really,” Arnold said of her project. She is the first woman to take on a feature film adaptation of Wuthering Heights, and she takes more artistic risks than any previous director.
Many adaptations don’t stay true to the character’s ages, but Arnold’s decision to remain true to Bronte’s vision was a simple one.
“It makes sense that they’re angry and passionate and slapping each other at 13,” she said.
The younger casting allowed her even more ability to delve into Cathy and Heathcliff’s complex psychology. The film then becomes a coming-of-age story for the two in which Cathy and Heathcliff struggle between the wildness of their childhood and the restrictions of adulthood. In focusing on this balance, the performances of the young actors are the best part of the film.
Arnold sees this struggle as an extension of Bronte’s own anxieties about societal perceptions of femininity in the 19th century.
“There’s Emily and Cathy roaming the moors being free and independent as children and then losing that freedom and independence when they hit puberty and had to be married,” she said.
But though Cathy is certainly less passive and more three-dimensional in this adaptation, she  still serves more as a symbol (of Heathcliff’s youthful hopes) rather than a true character.
A subtly mischievous Shannon Beer plays the young Cathy wonderfully. and Kaya Scoledario does an equally good job in a more restrained adult version of the character.
Solomon Glave is particularly suited to the part of the solemn and tormented Heathcliff, and James Howson does well as his more sophisticated older counterpart. Heathcliff becomes less the Byronic hero of old and more a cousin of James Dean from Rebel Without a Cause.
Indeed, Andrea Arnold sees the similarities in the moody young men.
“I started writing a contemporary version. When I was up in the moors, I saw this lad walking down somewhere wearing a hoodie and I thought, ‘Heathcliff! Heathcliff in a hoodie!’ And I started it that way,” she said.
Additionally, Arnold intended and succeeded in attempting to create audience empathy for Heathcliff.
“[In the novel], he’s this mythical, revengeful, brutal, angry character and yet, hang on a minute, didn’t they completely brutalize him as a child?”
One of the ways Arnold intended to highlight Heathcliff’s exclusion was by casting black actors in his role. Though Arnold acknowledges that this representation might not have been Bronte’s intention on the page, the symbolism of Heathcliff being a visually different race from his adopted family was important to her.
“[Bronte] played with him being different, and his difference is important,” said Arnold. “And the fact that he’s different does bring about some of the brutality and I wanted to be very clear about that. … Because I wanted to make it a very visual film, I wanted to make his difference very clear.”
In other aspects as well, the film succeeds at being visual. It is, simply put, beautiful. The camera hovers on thistle and local insects, storm clouds and raindrops.
But the visual emphasis also makes for the film’s downfall.
The supernatural is substituted for the natural and it seems sort of strange to watch Wuthering Heights without spectres and souls. Furthermore, there isn’t much in the way dialogue or transitions, and the narrative suffers for it.
Audience members, then, must have a thorough understanding of the novel to follow the plot. And those who have read the novel might be disappointed in the film’s divergences.
Though the actors can fill in blanks through looks and gestures, too much of the source material is still unfortunately omitted. And though forgoing the second half of the novel should be a good directorial choice, the film seems to end all too abruptly with many questions left unanswered.
But the overall question that Arnold asks us — “Are we born or are we made?” — does receive proper exploration. We see Heathcliff abused and angry from childhood, yet we also see him tender and hopeful with Cathy. The audience gets the sense that this version could have ended much more happily for its protagonists. That realistic exploration alone makes the film worth watching.
“Andrea Arnold’s Wuthering Heights . . . is not Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights, nor does it claim to be.”
Nonsense!
It’s claim is all over the film presentation.
Is it not called “Wuthering Heights”?
Isn’t Emily Bronte given credit as a source?
Hasn’t Ms Arnold said clearly that she never thought she would do a book, much less a classic of Ms Bronte’s
caliber?

Yes, “it is entirely different” which is why she should have called it something else and renamed the characters as well. Stop capitalizing on the Bronte name. It is obscene!!!

Though country music has not traditionally topped Billboard 100 Charts, many artists are starting to change that. Since the advent of Taylor Swift’s country-pop crossover and Zac Brown Band’s lovable, comforting beats, the genre has quickly gained more mainstream recognition and appreciation.

Georgia native and country veteran Jason Aldean has also made his fifth album, Night Train, appealing to fans of several other genres by incorporating strong guitar riffs and classic rock wailings reminiscent  of the ’70s and ’80s. This is all in contrast to the “country-hoe-down” songs he has become famous for, such as “Dirt Road Anthem” and “Tattoos On This Town.”
Aldean’s lead single, “Take A Little Ride,” acts as a successful teaser for the rest of his album — in fact, the catchy riffs and up-tempo beat have resulted in the song’s third consecutive week at the top of Billboard 100’s Country Chart.
The album also includes the soulful mid-tempo track named “Talk,”  which brings relatable lyrics that are soon sure to be blaring from radios: “But I don’t want to / I don’t wanna talk anymore / I know enough about you to know all I wanna do is / Find out a little bit more.”
In a surprisingly funky track labeled “1994,” Aldean manages to successfully blend country and old-school hip-hop in a tribute to ’90s country singer Joe Diffie: “I got that 1994 Joe Diffie comin’ out the radio / I’m just a country boy with a farmer’s tan / So help me girl I’ll be your pick-up man.”
The song’s prominent banjo and Aldean’s use of spoken word mark an interesting and succesful new direction for the country artist: Experimentation suits him.
The album would also not be complete without a few of the artist’s traditional, introspective tracks, but on Night Train the emotions are more mature. In “I Don’t Do Lonely Well,” Aldean displays his impressive and seemingly effortless vocal range. The song starts slow and builds to an emotional and deep chorus that presents his vulnerability and honesty.
Aldean is smart to access his soulful side. Despite his kick-back-good-time reputation and the new rock ‘n’ roll vibe of this album, Aldean proves a master of emotional versatility.
“Staring At the Sun” and “Black Tears” successfully evoke sympathy in listeners. The latter is perhaps one of the most notable tracks on the album, as it tells a moving story of a self-loathing stripper: “Black tears rollin’ down / From the eyes of an angel in a sinner’s town / She reveals, and they all cheer / And then she cries black tears.”
When Aldean returns to his country roots, however, as with “The Only Way I Know,” something’s amiss. Sure, the track is full of Southern attitude and pride and features other well-known country artists like Luke Bryan and Eric Church, but the sound feels too neat, trying too hard to fit in with Aldean’s new rock direction. Welcome as new sounds might be, listeners might still long for the twangy music reminiscent of open fields, dirt roads and rusty trucks — the kind of music you’d stomp your cowboy boots to.
That’s the dilemma with Night Train. The album certainly demonstrates Aldean’s desire to grow as an artist — in his unexpected genre mixing and especially emotional lyrics — but it doesn’t succeed as much as one might hope. The album teases the potential that his music can hold, but doesn’t always reach that potential.
Still, the ultimate message that seems to pervade the album is one of nostalgia for the country, and it’s fascinating despite the uneven musical execution. While Aldean’s previous albums have largely been about partying, young love and heartache, his latest one demonstrates a longing for a life-long love interest. Night Train is a grown-up manifesto, a re-evaluation of Aldean’s priorities and goals.
Aldean’s tour, ending on Oct. 27, sold out every show within a few minutes and broke several attendance and ticket sales records. He’s also received three nominations for the Country Music Awards on Nov. 1 for Entertainer of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year and Single of the Year. Thus, Night Train, no matter the quality, will be a commercially successful album. That it aims for new sounds and themes despite its predetermined success, makes it especially admirable.

Obama’s performance: Elena Kadvany
Tonight, the real president showed up. President Barack Obama was passionate, focused, eloquent, defensive — in short, he was the man who inspired so many voters four years ago, the man who still has the power to do so today.
The town hall format of the second presidential debate forced Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney to finally voice their policies and opinions on many issues that have been relatively ignored this election season. The debate, which included the usual suspects of tax policy and the economy — but also less-heard issues such as gender inequality in the workplace and immigration policy — revealed Romney to be a weak and inconsistent candidate unfit to sit in the Oval Office.
Obama focused on facts and moving forward while Romney got hung up on “he said, he said” type issues and backtracked on many statements he’s previously made. For example, on immigration, Obama reinforced his commitment to serious reform and reminded viewers the efforts he has made on the issue — the DREAM Act, the recent legislation for young immigrants — all of which are significant steps forward and possibly the most he could accomplish in a Congress so divided on the topic.
Romney, on the surface, also reinforced his commitment to immigration reform — saying he supports all legal immigrants that come to the United States and wants to create a system that reflects that. For the children of illegal immigrants, Romney said he supports a path to citizenship, despite the fact that he’s repeatedly said that he will veto the DREAM Act. Instead of admitting this and explaining, he returned to his favorite fall back: “Obama was bad, I’ll do better.”
Not to mention, on a crucial student issue — Pell Grants and loans — Romney took stances that are in direct opposition with Rep. Paul Ryan’s beliefs. In response to the very first question of the night, from a 20-year-old first-time voter concerned about getting a job after graduation, Romney said, “I want to make sure we keep our Pell Grant program growing.” But Ryan’s budget plan calls for a $200 billion cut from Pell Grants. This is not to say that Ryan’s plans are Romney’s, but it’s another source of inconsistency that should trouble Romney supporters.
Obama, on the other hand, was a rock of consistency, tenaciously defending his policies and beliefs — even to the point of visible anger at Romney’s faulty logic and false claims. Obama’s first debate performance was admittedly disappointing, especially for voters who might have supported him in 2008 and are now on the fence. But tonight, we saw the real Obama — the one who can lead our country for the next four years.
________________________________________________________________________________________
Romney’s performance: Sarah Cueva
After the second presidential debate, the win record is 1-1. President Barack Obama came out swinging in tonight’s debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., making Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney look desperate and unfocused in his arguments.
Romney started out with a very lackluster answer to a question that is surely on the minds of college students everywhere: How will we know that we will find satisfactory employment after graduation? Aside from saying that he would not eliminate Pell grants, Romney failed to adequately address how he would ensure that college graduates would find jobs, instead going on a generic tangent about how he “knows what it takes” to create jobs.
As the debate went on, it seemed that Romney was on the defensive and was trying to avoid controversy by skirting specifics in laying out his policy plans. This backfired when it became clear that Obama was laying out more specific, point-by-point plans.
Romney did make some valid points regarding the failures of the Obama administration, most notably Obama’s rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline. Energy policy is one of the biggest issues facing America, especially given unsustainably high prices at the pump. It is one thing to say that we need to reach energy independence, but it is a different thing entirely to actually enact tough policies to reach this goal. Romney’s arguments here showed that he would be better suited to this purpose as president.
Other than this positive moment for Romney, he came across as disingenuous and overtly political throughout most of the debate. His biggest mistake was his accusation of Obama as not doing enough in the days following the attacks that killed U.S. Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya last month. He also falsely stated that Obama did not mention terrorism until two weeks after the event, and moderator Candy Crowley’s fact-check drew applause from the otherwise quiet audience.
Though Obama appeared to be the crowd favorite this time, Republicans should hope that Romney will learn from his mistakes and redeem himself in the third and final debate of this election cycle. Because if his demeanor and arguments in this debate are any indicator of his performance as president, the next four years do not look promising.

The Village at USC project might have cleared its final major hurdle last Wednesday when it was officially approved by a Los Angeles City Council committee. The University Village redevelopment project, however, still represents the bare minimum effort put forward by the university to accommodate community interests.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
At a public hearing last August, the City Council’s Planning and Land Use Management Committee put USC’s plan to redevelop the aging University Village on hold, claiming the university had not made the requisite considerations of community needs regarding the project. This decision resulted from testimony given by community groups that argued The Village would not be able to fulfill a promise to keep students out of low-income housing units that local residents need.
Wednesday’s hearing represented a compromise between the university and community groups. USC received the go-ahead from the committee, provided it up its previous commitment of $2 million in low-income housing subsidies for the neighborhood to a more realistic $20 million. The agreement also includes the creation of a legal clinic at the USC Gould School for Law to help solve tenant-landlord disputes and a provision that gives hiring priority to local residents.
This agreement, however, only addresses the concerns for which the council made the most noise. Since the council did not adequately represent all of the community’s needs, the agreement does not either.
The plan entirely overlooks the protection of local small business interests that community groups specifically petitioned both the council and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for in the weeks leading up to Wednesday’s hearing.
As reported by the Daily Trojan, approximately one dozen current UV tenants voiced concerns at the hearing over the future of their businesses. Among them was 22-year-old Wendy’s franchise owner Ketan Sharma who, like all of his fellow business-owners, has received no guarantee from the university that he will be able to keep his business, or that he will be compensated in the event he cannot.
“The only guarantee is that they will talk before demolition,” Sharma said on Oct. 10. “This keeps me awake at night.”
The consequences of this disregard for local businesses could be catastrophic for the community. Not only will it potentially ruin business owners, like Sharma, but it will also cost the employees of these businesses their jobs. Though The Village might offer them future employment opportunities, USC is offering no assistance plan for displaced workers in the meantime. For low-income families living paycheck to paycheck, two years of unemployment could mean the loss of their homes.
The permanent loss of these businesses will also have detrimental effects on the local residents who are their primary customers. Superior Grocers, for example, offers community members affordable produce as well as particular spices, herbs, baked goods and ethnic foods geared toward the neighborhood’s Latino population.
Superior, however, doesn’t seem to fit with The Village’s flashy, upper-middle class and student-centric theme, and with the no-guarantees policy for current tenants, it doesn’t seem likely the loyal grocer will be returning.
Los Angeles already has a chronic problem with providing lower-income families access to affordable healthy food. Replacing Superior with a more expensive store like Trader Joe’s (as rumor has it) would only exacerbate this problem. Thrifty and lower-income students will also suffer, either from having to buy produce that can be up to five times as expensive at stores like Ralph’s or subsisting on an unhealthier diet of cheap food.
Renovating the UV and expanding student housing does not necessitate the replacement of local businesses with more expensive, more exclusive venues. In fact, The Village’s space-efficient layout can allow for the retention of the old businesses while still leaving room for new retail and dining options.
The UV redevelopment project doesn’t have to damage the community. But unless USC provides local businesses with guaranteed continuance of their tenancy and implements measures to tide over their employees and customers in the interim, The Village at USC will hurt many locals, and a general resentment of university development will resonate in the community for years to come.

This article is completely disgusting, and the Daily Trojan should be ashamed for publishing it. These community activist groups just extorted $20 million from USC that they have no right taking, and you’re saying we aren’t doing enough? Are you even a USC student?
How could the city conclude that the new UV would not “keep students out of low-income housing units that local residents need”? The apartments that are being built are for students. By increasing the availability of student housing a there will be a decrease in the demand for adjacent low income housing by students. Since the current UV has no apartments/housing this just makes sense. 
Also the university upped its commitment from 2 million dollars to a more “realistic” 20 million dollars? Realistic? Since when is a 20 million dollar penalty to build on your own land realistic? Its not enough that USC is the single largest private employer in Los Angeles but in order to build something on land they own, with their own money for their own students the city gets to extort 20 million dollars out of them? Thats the value of Superior, a laundromat and that crappy Wendys off Hoover?
You seem to not understand how a free market economy works.
spoken like a true socialist.

Students across campus were surprised last week when they walked into dining halls and found notices that, should they be caught removing utensils, food or drinks from a dining facility, they would be fined $100 per offense.
Though the new policy is fair in its attempt to impede students from walking out with utensils, which are owned by the dining halls, USC Hospitality is wrong to restrict student access to the food they have rightly paid for and is in violation of its own commitment to provide students a positive residential experience.
All students living on campus are required to purchase a meal plan — at a cost many would argue is greater than its worth. The Cardinal Meal Plan, the least expensive option, costs $2,550 per semester and includes no dining dollars. This means that in a single semester, students with this plan pay $21.25 per day to eat exclusively dining hall meals.
Such a cost for meals of sometimes subpar quality should be enough to allow students to walk out with small amounts of food, such as a sandwich, burger, slice of pizza or a piece of cake.
According to the fee notice, the aim of the new policy is to “keep costs down for everyone.” But the snacks students take to-go, for times when they are in a hurry or the dining hall is closing, do not increase costs at all. Students would have eaten that food no matter what; where they eat it has nothing to do with how much it costs.
In reality, this new policy drives food costs up for students, who now have to buy snacks and late-night meals elsewhere on campus on top of the meal plan they’re already required to pay for.
Not to mention the fine is out of touch with the way students’ schedules work. Though students with unlimited entries to dining halls are allowed to eat as many times as they want per day at no extra charge, it is unrealistic to expect that students would have enough time to visit a dining hall every two hours for a snack.
Even if students visit dining halls only two or three times a day, many cannot sit down and eat while still being on time for their next class or obligation. Long walks, long lines and slow service — particularly during dining hall rush hours — sometimes necessitate that students eat their meals on the go.
But the new policy prevents students from doing so, in spite of their right to consume the food they have paid for. Students end up shoveling down their food at unhealthy speeds, paying little attention to portion size or the nutritional content of what they’re eating.
The consequences of these unhealthy eating habits are particularly troublesome — and even dangerous — for students who have special dietary needs. Students who have diabetes, for example, might need to snack throughout the day in order to maintain necessary blood glucose levels. By implementing such a fee, USC Hospitality compromises the health of those students with dietary restrictions whom they have promised to accommodate.
USC cannot continue to promote a positive residential experience while making it inconvenient and unhealthy for students to eat. The new $100 fee must be reconsidered to make residential dining positive again.
 
Georgia Soares is a freshman majoring in English.
While the fee is a problem, Hospitality does have some justification to what they’re putting in place- select students were taking loafs of bread and pints of milk as if it were a grocery store. Taking a sandwich to-go is not absurd, but there ended up being a select few that ruined it for everybody. Rather than everybody complaining, someone needs to offer hospitality a solution. Or, switch to the dining plan made completely of dining dollars. There are other options. Go buy groceries.
While the policy is weird I don’t think the food is “subpar”. I’m very picky about food and have found the dining hall food to be healthy if you want it to be and quite good.  You can also take a banana to go if you like.
Many students eat too much to begin with.  Better to fine them for being obese sorority girls!   I don’t want to end paying for their health problems later in life for their bad eating decisions today
Gabriel,
You are a sexist pig and should be ashamed of yourself!
My daughters is a rower and has been accosted for taking a banana with her to practice.
USC is ridiculous
 She’ll be transferring.
Can you hear the helicopters?
I can hear them.  I get being annoyed. I even get complaining. Transferring schools because you can’t take your banana to go is evidence of seriously out-of-whack priorities (either that or Angry as Hell is fake as hell, which is more plausible)
Anyone who would transfer universities over that is doomed to a life of unhappiness.
I am the mother of a freshman in Dornslife and I was appalled when I read this “fee” had been instituted.  Thank you for bringing this to light, especially for those of us who are not on campus. I will share your opinion piece with my network  of parents and friends. Well done Georgia, Fight On indeed!
