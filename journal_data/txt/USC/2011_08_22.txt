For years the USC athletic department has commemorated Trojans who have won an NCAA individual championship, earned first team All-American honors or secured an Olympic gold medal by installing a bronze medallion on Heritage Hall’s Honors Rail, which presides proudly above the first-floor museum.

The athletic department might soon encounter an enviable quandary: how to recognize USC’s exceptional student-athletes once the rail no longer affords space for these medallions.
In the meantime and in anticipation of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London, the athletic department is commencing a yearlong tribute to its former Olympic athletes as part of the “Cardinal and Gold Medal Heritage” salute.
“We are extremely proud of our unparalleled Olympic heritage and, with the 2012 Olympic Games on the horizon, we felt it was important to salute and acknowledge that tradition,” USC athletic director Pat Haden said in a statement.  “I know our fans will be as excited as I am to see our past and current Olympians and to relive the many successes that Trojan athletes have had in Olympic competition.”
This tribute aims to recognize USC’s unparalleled Olympic tradition, one which places the university ahead of all others in Olympians, gold medalists and combined medalists. Since 1904, 393 Trojans have participated in the Olympics for a combined 57 nations in 28 different sports.
These athletes have won a total of 122 gold medals. If USC were its own country, this gold medal count would place it 12th in the world.
As part of the salute, the athletic department will invite former Olympians to appear at sporting events in the fall with accompanying videoboard highlight clips, display banners in front of Heritage Hall and contribute footage and interviewees to FSN Prime Ticket and ESPN Radio 710 for short feature stories.
All of this effort complements the Pac-12’s “Follow the Pac-12 to London” campaign, which endeavors to highlight the conference’s vaunted Olympic history.

Falyn Fonoimoana declared ineligible
The No. 2 USC women’s volleyball team, which begins its season Aug. 26, can take pride in last year’s impressive run to the Final Four and the return of several players who earned Pac-10 or All-American honors just a year ago.
On Friday, those feats were momentarily overshadowed by a huge loss.
Sophomore outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana, last season’s Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, will not be joining her team on the court this year.
USC coach Mick Haley said in a statement Friday the former top recruit in the country had been ruled ineligible for the 2011 season.
“We exhausted all of our resources in order to help Falyn retain her eligibility,” Haley said. “We have very high expectations of our student-athletes, on and off the court, here at USC.”
No other players or coaches associated with the team were available for comment on this issue.
In her first season, Fonoimoana started 31 of the team’s 34 matches. One of six freshmen on the team, which made up the No. 1 recruiting class in the country, she recorded 398 kills and 468 points, ranking second on the team in both categories.
She was a member of the Pac-10 Conference All-Freshman Team and was named the AVCA/Pacific Region Freshman of the Year.
USC opens the season against No. 12 Minnesota in University Park, Pa. before squaring off against No. 1 Penn State on Aug. 27.

Former USC safety traded to Bengals
The San Francisco 49ers traded traded second-year safety Taylor Mays to the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday for an undisclosed draft pick, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported.
The trade comes two and a half weeks after the 49ers reportedly contacted the league’s other 31 teams, informing them that Mays was available.
A former All-American at USC from 2006-2009, Mays, who was selected No. 49 overall by the 49ers during the 2010 NFL draft, recorded 38 tackles and one forced fumble in six starts during his rookie season.
Most memorably, during an Oct. 3 contest against the Atlanta Falcons, the 49ers blocked a punt in Atlanta’s end zone and Mays scooped up the ball for a touchdown.
While playing for the Trojans, Mays earned All-American and All-Pac-10 honors three times and was also one of the three finalists for the Jim Thorpe Award, given annually to the nation’s best defensive back, following the 2008 season.
On June 26, 2011, he was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

Former Trojan cornerback lost for the season
In what was expected to be a Pro Bowl season, former USC Trojan football player Terrell Thomas was injured in Monday’s preseason game against the Chicago Bears.
The New York Giants announced Thomas had torn the ACL in his right knee and will likely miss the entire season.
With about 30 seconds left in the first half, Bears quarterback Jay Cutler threw a screen pass to running back Marion Barber. Thomas, who was in pursuit of Cutler, collided awkwardly with Bears defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul and crumpled to the ground.
Thomas, who started every game at cornerback for the Giants in 2010, recorded five interceptions, four forced fumbles and 101 tackles last season. He is in the final year of his contract with the Giants.

USC’s Valeria Pulido competes, thrives at World University Games
After a strong freshman campaign last spring, sophomore Valeria Pulido continued to ride the momentum off her stellar season at the World University Games this summer.
Playing for Mexico, Pulido and partner Leticia Nazari Urbina ran the table against ranked opponents to make it to the semifinals of the World University Games.
Along the way, Pulido/Urbina bested the USA squad of Courtney Collins and Krista Damico (4-6, 6-3, 7-5), and knocked off the top-seeded pair Chinwei Chan and Wenhsin Hsu of Taipei with a 7-5, 6-3 victory.
In order to reach the semifinals, the Mexican squad took down the No. 5-seeded Polish team of Olga Brozda and Natalia Kolat (3-6, 6-4, 6-2), before falling to China’s Guo/Li in two sets, 7-6 (6), 6-3.
Although Pulido couldn’t match USC coach Richard Gallien’s gold medal count in these games (he took home gold for Team USA in 1983), her impressive performance is a positive sign for the Women of Troy in the coming year.
Pulido, playing in the No. 4 singles spot last spring, teamed up with junior Alison Ramos during the 2010-11 season, compiling an 18-10 record in doubles play last year. Pulido’s role on the team at USC only figures to increase with the departure of senior Maria Sanchez after this year.

USC men’s water polo enter season as No. 1 in nation
During the last three years, few collegiate teams have enjoyed the success the USC men’s water polo team has.
Winners of three consecutive NCAA championships, it’s no surprise to see USC atop the 2011 national preseason rankings. Under the guidance of coach Jovan Vavic, the Trojans have also claimed three of the last four Mountain Pacific Sports Federation titles, and are again projected to finish first at season’s end.
USC returns all of its starters from last year’s national title team, led by All-American’s Matt Burton and Joel Dennerley as well as the leading scorer from a year ago in sophomore driver Nikola Vavic. Its returning veteran players, combined with the addition of a top-notch recruiting class, makes USC a heavy favorite to make history and become the first team to win four straight national titles.
Despite defeating California to earn the 2010 title, being ranked 1st in the preseason will be uncharted waters for many members of this USC squad.
Last season, the Trojans were selected fourth in the preseason poll before navigating a tough schedule on their way to the title.
The Trojans’ quest for an unprecedented fourth straight national championship begins Sept. 3 at the UC Irvine Inviational.

Gemelos grabs gold at World University Games
USC guard Jacki Gemelos helped Team USA finish an undefeated run at the World University Games, giving her a gold medal and another honor to add to her long list of accomplishments.
Gemelos chipped in five points, two assists and a rebound in the championship game to help the USA defeat Taiwan 101-66, capping a dominant and impressive six-game run throughout the University Games.
On the way to the gold-medal game, Team USA defeated Brazil, Slovakia, Great Britain, Finland and Australia, winning each game by double-digits.
In the six games, Gemelos averaged 4.8 points, 2.5 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 15.7 minutes per game.
In her first full season playing with USC last year, Gemelos was the team’s third leading scorer, averaging 12.4 points per game, along with almost five rebounds and three assists.
Her stellar play was recognized when she received All-Pac-10 honorable mention, leading the conference in three-point field goal percentage.
She also played a prominent role in leading the Women of Troy to the Women’s National Invitational Tournament national championship game, where they fell short of the title to Toledo.

Despite many major moments of the 2010 season being dominated by obvious growing pains and missed opportunities, there remained a constant staple in the Trojans’ offense fans could always get excited about — the exhilarating connection that junior quarterback Matt Barkley shared with then-freshman wide receiver Robert Woods.
Veteran leadership · Redshirt junior wide receiver Brice Butler, who initially planned to transfer following last season and missed spring practice as a result, caught nine passes for 112 yards and one touchdown in 2010. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Quickly getting time as a starter alongside veteran Ronald Johnson, Woods exploded for 792 yards and six touchdowns on 65 receptions, taking advantage of what Barkley now describes as a “telepathic” connection between the two. His success bolstered a squad that had been weakened by injury and inexperience, and by the end of the season, he had proven he was ready to step into Johnson’s cleats as the position leader.
Even with the promise that Woods brought, questions surrounding the unit have continued to linger: Would any veteran receivers finally make the strides necessary to become reliable starters? Could any of the new guys replicate what Woods did in 2010? And who would step up as the leading second receiver?
Though we won’t know until season’s end, there remains enough reason to believe these questions have an answer — or many, for that matter.
Cue fall camp.
For starters, senior wide receiver Brandon Carswell and junior wide receiver Brice Butler look to have finally embraced their roles as veterans on an otherwise young and inexperienced squad. With both of them seeing a decent share of playing time last season, Carswell recorded 16 catches for 205 yards and Butler had nine grabs for 112 yards, they have been pressured in camp to show their experience and leadership and have responded in turn.
It’s a fortunate turn of events for Butler, who announced in late January that he intended to transfer via Twitter, citing playing time and noting a desire to play in the NFL. Tensions between Butler and USC coach Lane Kiffin appeared to grow after Butler’s father, former Atlanta Falcons defensive back Bobby Butler, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution a week later that the younger Butler did not receive a “fair chance” under Kiffin’s watch. Butler, who rejoined the team in May, has impressed during fall workouts.
Though minor injuries have limited Carswell and Butler at times, they could each be starting opposite Woods come the team’s Sept. 3 season opener at home against Minnesota — provided each continues his upward progression.
“You’d like those to be older guys because they have more experience and more maturity,” Kiffin said, when asked about Carswell or Butler starting alongside Woods. “But we pride ourselves on playing the best players.”
The freshman class, however, might get there first.
Dotted with five-star recruits and overflowing with raw talent, it has been the lesser-known newcomers that have stolen the spotlight during fall camp, perhaps none more so than freshman Marquise Lee.
Lee, who was a former teammate of Woods and fellow freshman George Farmer at Serra High School in Gardena, Calif., has wasted no time in getting acclimated with his surroundings and, in doing so, has garnered some head-turning praise throughout summer and fall camp.
“[Marquise is] definitely making plays and standing out,” Woods said. “Pushing the ball vertically, breaking tackles and making moves.”
Kiffin also expressed similar sentiments, making it abundantly clear that he was thoroughly impressed with Lee.
“We’re still two weeks from the opener, but he’s definitely showed he’s going to play a lot,” he said.
That sounds convincing enough, especially coming from a coach who typically keeps a vacuum-seal on developments regarding the team.
But the list continues. Redshirt freshman Kyle Prater looks to crack the rotation just one season after redshirting because of nagging injuries — a hamstring and a groin injury. If healthy, Prater, with his 6-foot-5 frame, could provide a big target for Barkley much like fellow 6-foot-5ers Mike Williams and Dwayne Jarrett did for Heisman Trophy-winning quarters Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart, as well as John David Booty, in the mid-2000s.
To say these breakthroughs are timely, though, is putting it lightly — the Trojans need consistent pass threats this season. With running back issues on and off the field and an offensive line weakened by injury, USC will have to rely on its passing attack early and often if it is going to put up points.
Considering that Barkley, who threw 26 touchdowns last fall, is primed for his biggest season, this is probably for the best.
There just needs to be someone to reel it all in. Last year he completed passes to 14 different receivers, as the options he had to throw to game to game varied significantly because of injuries. Now, with more consistency in the dedicated receivers corps, there is little standing in his way of putting up career numbers.

As Robert Woods said recently, “We [ the receivers and QB] are only as good as the OL.”
Excellent article about the receivers but you don’t consider the role of the OL to help them be successful.

There was a moment during Sunday’s intersquad scrimmage when it looked as if USC players had taken their newest mantra to heart. The Trojans were roughly one-third of the way through their final full contact scrimmage of the fall.
Takeaways · Junior safety TJ McDonald, pictured here against California on Oct. 16, finished second on the team with three interceptions in 2010. - Daily Trojan file photo
And then sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey scooped up a fumbled exchange between junior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore tailback Dillon Baxter, returning it 90 yards for a touchdown, high-stepping his way into the end zone.
“That’s the easiest way to score: taking the ball to the house for six,” Robey said. “It’s about stripping the ball.”
USC has placed an additional emphasis on forcing turnovers ever since it opened training camp Aug. 4. Drills emphasizing stripping the ball have become near-routine through nearly three weeks of practice, and still, 8.5” by 11” sheets of paper, with the words “That’s our ball” line the entrance of Heritage Hall.
“That’s what we’ve been big on so far: ball security and forcing turnovers,” said Robey, who led the team with four interceptions in 2010. “Any time we can find a loose ball and jump on it. We’ve really been stressing that.”
And for good reason. If anything serves as an indicator of the Trojans’ success this past decade, its a fluctuating turnover margin.
During the last five seasons, in which the Trojans averaged 10 wins per year, they finished with an average turnover margin of plus 3.4. In the five seasons prior, they averaged a margin of plus 17. And during those years, they averaged 11 wins per season, winning two Associated Press national championships and, at one point, 34 consecutive games.
As a result, to get back to double-digit win totals — following an eight-win season in 2010 and a nine-win season in 2009 — the Trojans hope to reverse this trend.
“We’ve been okay,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said about the team’s penchant for forcing turnovers. “It’s something we have to build awareness as a defense.”
In some of USC’s closest contests last season, turnovers proved problematic. During a nationally televised home game Oct. 30 against Oregon, which the Trojans lost by three touchdowns, Barkley threw two late interceptions and fumbled a snap mid-way through the third quarter. Oregon, in comparison, turned the ball over twice.
During a Nov. 20 contest at Oregon State, USC had two turnovers: an interception by way of Barkley and a fumble from then-senior tailback Allen Bradford. Its defense, however, forced none. Similarly, USC fell to the Beavers 36-7.
“I need to move the ball and be efficient,” Barkley said. “Just be accurate with my throws.”
Among starting Pac-10 quarterbacks in 2010, only Arizona State’s Steven Threet, with 16 interceptions, finished with more than Barkley, who had 12. It is a nagging issue, however, that Barkley appears to have a handle on as of late, following a touchdown-to-interception ratio of five-to-one during Sunday’s scrimmage.
“He continues to plug along and develop his game,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “I just hope these pieces around him stay healthy, because if they do, he can have a pretty special year.”
The theme remains pretty clear: protect the ball on offense, force turnovers on defense.
And on the defense at least, the Trojans hope, with added experience, they can force more than just the 13 interceptions and three fumbles they caused in 2010.
“As you get older and you get more comfortable, you can play faster and start going for the ball,” Galippo said. “You know when you can take your shots. Our defense is moving toward that. We’re not a young defense anymore.”
Of USC’s 11 projected starters on defense, at least six are upperclassmen, and for those such as Robey, a sophomore, they now have a year of starting experience under their belts.
“I feel like I’m a step ahead,” Robey said. “Last year, it was kind of rough coming in and trying to get down the playbook in two months. Now, I’m playing faster.”
USC did not practice Monday because of the first day of classes.
This is the key to the USC defense in 2011!  Excellent article.

It wasn’t the start it had hoped for, and it wasn’t pretty either.
Not enough · Sophomore goalie Shelby Church, pictured here on Sunday against San Diego, and the Women of Troy defense couldn’t stop San Diego senior forward Stephanie Ochs, who notched a hat trick to lead the Toreros to a 3-1 win. - Mac Carlile | Daily Trojan
The No. 25 USC women’s soccer team fell twice in its opening weekend slate of games at McAllister Field, marking the first time in the program’s history it had dropped two straight at home to open the season.
“We just couldn’t finish,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said.
The Women of Troy (0-2) fell to rival San Diego 3-1 Sunday following a hat trick from senior forward Stephanie Ochs, giving the Toreros (2-0) their third straight victory over USC. Last season, San Diego similarly bested USC 1-0 during the team’s season opener.
“I think we lost track of their best player and they found her and she buried us,” Khosroshahin said. “One player. One player killed us.”
The Women of Troy, however, were forced to play the last third of the match short one player after sophomore midfielder Morgan Murrow received her second yellow card, putting an already struggling USC attack at a serious disadvantage.
“I thought until the red card we still had stretches where we had them pinned in,” Khosroshahin said. “I’ve got to go look at the film and see what we’ve got to do.”
USC did get on the scoreboard in the 89th minute when junior forward Erica Vangsness, a recent transfer from Pierce College, connected on a shot  at the top of the box, averting would have been their third straight shutout loss to the Toreros.
“We were knocking the ball around well,” senior defender Claire Schloemer said. “Shots weren’t on frame. Just unlucky, I guess.”
Although all of San Diego’s scoring came from the leg of one player, there was concern over USC’s defensive performance.
“[The backline] is a little shaky at best,” Khosroshahin said. “We need to shore it up.”
Schloemer was quick to echo similar sentiments, asserting the problem was simply a failure to execute.
“We knew the style of play they like,” she said. “We knew that from the start and just didn’t take care of [Ochs]. I thought that at the beginning we were strong on her, and then as the game went on, we broke down.”
Their loss on Friday in the season opener against Long Beach State, however, was an even more frustrating affair for the Women of Troy. The 49ers played USC to a 1-1 tie until the 86th minute before senior midfielder Shawna Gordon scored on a header to give Long Beach State a narrow victory.
The game was one of missed opportunities for USC, which saw several shots on goal hit the post, including one in the waning seconds of regulation and didn’t deliver during its scoring chances.
“We missed a lot of easy passes, where we had players available to us,” Khosroshahin said. “We gave it away. When you give the ball away with no pressure on you, the game is very difficult.”
USC scored its inaugural goal of the 2011 season when sophomore Haley Boysen found the back of the net with a header in the 17th minute. The 1-0 lead lasted until Long Beach State’s Alex Balcer’s free kick sailed over the outstretched arms of USC goalkeeper Shelby Church for the equalizer in the 36th minute.
“I don’t think the team felt any first game jitters,” Boysen said. “I think we all felt confident because we’ve been working really hard in practice. It just wasn’t enough today.”
USC’s next opportunity to get in the win column comes next weekend in unfriendly territory at the University of San Diego tournament.
The Women of Troy will square off against Kansas on Friday and face Pacific on Sunday.

Though summertime is winding down, the warm weather lasts much longer in Southern California, leaving more time to focus on getting that beach body. And more often than not, a good beach body means excellent abdominals.
Six packs. Abs. Action stars have them, people want them and fitness programs market themselves on their ability to grant them. But when looking at the overall benefits, in health and in strength, it is better to expand the focus toward the entire core — not just the abdominal muscles.
The core, which includes the back muscles, the abdominals, the obliques, muscles on the sides of the body and the minor muscles below the shoulders and upper body and above the pelvis, is used in every complex exercise. An undeveloped core can lead to poor back posture, which is bad for the spine, as well as a greater likelihood of sports and weight lifting injuries. The abdominals are good for sit-ups and such, but the core moves the entire body.
Like most workouts, there is not a one-exercise-hits-every-muscle trick. Different parts of the core require different workouts.
For the abdominals, sit-ups and crunches are essential activities. Crunches focus solely on the abdominals, while sit-ups work the back and other muscles. To get the most out of these, keep your feet planted firmly on the ground and make sure your abdominals are doing the work — don’t swing your arms or rely on the momentum from swinging your arms.
To focus on the obliques, try Russian twists. Sit down, with your back at a 45-degree angle, knees bent, as if for sit-ups, and lift your feet off the ground. Hands clasped together, twist your abdomen to one side, and then to the other. Do this for a set of 40 repetitions. For a tougher workout, hold a weight instead of putting your hands together.
For those who are truly pressed for time and are looking for the most effective workout in the shortest amount of time, try this: To work on the chest and back, do push-ups. These are quick, easy to do and can be done anywhere. To focus on the abdominals and the back, do sit-ups and not crunches, but follow up a set of 30 by lying flat on the ground and lifting your legs — straight and fully extended — off the ground by a half-foot and holding that position for around 30 seconds.
And one excellent, effective and quick exercise is the myotatic (relating to or involved in a muscular stretch reflex) crunch. Instead of compressing the abdominals like a regular crunch does, this exercise stretches the muscles, giving it a different but more intense workout.
Take a BOSU ball or a stack of firm pillows and sit down on it, hands overhead and body bent at around a 45-degree angle. Very slowly, and making sure not to let your arms move in front of your head, lie back. This should take four seconds. Once flat, stretch out with your arms as far as possible for two seconds. Return to that 45-degree position slowly, taking another four seconds. Repeat for a set of 10 crunches.
These quick exercises are good for those with busy schedules and no time for a full workout at the gym, and they are extremely effective for anyone working on their core.
It is worth noting, however, that exercise focused on the core, specifically the abdominals, alone will not create six-pack abs. The abdominals, no matter how built up, cannot be seen if body fat is beyond a certain point, usually more than 12 percent.
To get that low percentage and the action hero/heroine stomach, make sure to follow an eating pattern low in sugars and fats and high in protein. After a few weeks, body fat should start to decrease at a consistent rate until you’re at that magic number.
Abs are good, but they’re limited for health. When there is a greater set of workouts available that focus on more of the body, while still providing the action hero abs, go for that one. Good fitness helps the body, internally and in appearance.

It is worth noting that a healthy body fat percentage for young women (conducive to menstruation and other necessary bodily function) is between 21 and 32 percent. The absolute MINIMUM is between 13 and 17 percent – above your 12 percent quote.
Wouldn’t you agree that achieving good health, even if it means packing on some pounds and having a softer stomach, is far more advisable than maintaining an unhealthily low body weight/fat percentage, but having ‘killer abs’?
NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT MENSTRUATION. NO FAT CHICKS, THX.

It takes an event of great magnitude to entirely shut down a portion of the legendary Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Each year the Sunset Strip Music Festival does just that, and it accomplishes it in adrenaline-pumping fashion. This year’s street festival was no different, closing the street between San Vicente and Doheny Drive.
Musical legends · The Sunset Strip Music Festival proved to be an exciting night of rock and roll, featuring performances from the quirky Cobra Starship, topped off with a 90-minute set by Mötley Crüe. - Photo courtesy of MSO
One stage on each end of the street, a beer garden, a Gibson guitar demonstration area and various food trucks comprised the outside portion of the festival while the Sunset Strip’s classic, iconic venues like Whiskey A Go-Go, The Roxy and the Key Club also featured performances by bands throughout the eight-hour day and night.
This year’s festival had one theme in mind: a tribute to the very band that got its start in those clubs — Mötley Crüe. Celebrating their 30th anniversary as a band, the ’80s classic rockers (Vince Neil on vocals, Nikki Sixx on bass, Mick Mars on guitar and Tommy Lee on drums) were present to perform, with each band paying homage to them throughout the day.
The rest of the lineup was quite eclectic, featuring the frenetic hip-hop outfit Public Enemy (hyped by Flava Flav) and the electronic pop beats of married duo Matt & Kim, to name a few.
Cobra Starship also joined the extensive list of performers and played an energetic set early in the day to a modest-sized crowd. The band’s performance was enjoyable as it blazed through its pop-rock catalogue, playing favorites like “You Make Me Feel…” and the contagiously catchy hit single “Good Girls Go Bad.”
Cobra Starship sounded thrilling and brought a nice intensity to the stage — especially frontman Gabe Saporta — although the crowd did not really reciprocate, which further indicated the band’s music was out of place at the festival honoring Mötley Crüe.
Inside the various clubs, a better grasp of the classic rock genre could be felt. Though most of the bands playing on the small stages were newcomers or relatively unknown, it was easy to be pleasantly surprised by some exciting new discoveries.
One such impressive band was Love and a .38, who played to a decently sized crowd in the Key Club during the middle of the day. This aggressive quartet melded the genres of classic rock and alternative rock into a fiery presentation of fist-pumping anthems that hooked many of the fickle crowd members into watching its full performance.
Now reunited for a year, alternative rock band Bush played to a large crowd as the sun began to set, inciting crowd participation during songs like “Glycerine” and “Comedown,” in addition to performing a refreshing take on The Beatles’ “Come Together.”
It was obvious throughout the entire day this show belonged to Mötley Crüe, and it owned its moment in the spotlight. From its shocking pyrotechnic opening to its honest, heartfelt reflections about its career beginnings during the ballad “Home Sweet Home,” its hour-and-a-half set had the crowd entirely enthralled.
The band blazed through hits like “Same Ol’ Situation (S.O.S.),” “Live Wire,” “Dr. Feelgood,” “Girls Girls Girls,” “Shout at the Devil” and the subjective, unofficial anthem of our beloved city, “Saints of Los Angeles.”
Tommy Lee took the crowd on a roller coaster ride as he performed a seven-minute drum solo while riding around a 360-degree vertical loop suspended on the stage.
Mötley Crüe’s set had nonstop flames, fireworks, smoke, dancers and loud music: It perfectly personified the band’s personality and storied career and was a testament to why the band was being honored. When they closed with the crowd-pleaser “Kickstart My Heart,” the screaming of the attendees was deafening, especially when the band took an extended bow before leaving the stage. Before it left, the band made sure to dump buckets of fake blood on everyone standing within the first few rows of the stage.
The Sunset Strip Music Festival provided an exhilarating celebration of rock’n’roll — at the exact location the genre has its roots — and proved to be an unforgettable night, not just for the honorees of Mötley Crüe, but also for every person who partook in the festivities.

In the ancient times of the ’80s, a hero rose on the silver screen, his coming heralded with steel and operatic battlesong. His name was enough to spark terror in the hearts of camels. He was Conan the Barbarian, known to earthly mortals as Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Barbaric · Conan (Jason Mamoa) plays a rippling barbarian who slaughters his enemies mercilessly and parades around in loincloths. - Photo courtesy of Lionsgate
Whether it is with fond nostalgia or eyerolls at the cheese, 1982’s  Conan the Barbarian is our most pop culture-ensconced vision of the Cimmerian warrior king. In reality, the legend of Conan began as a pulp series of short stories in the 1930s, written by the talented and tragic author Robert E. Howard.
Since the ’30s, Conan has faced down comics, novels and the legendary ’80s movie, but now he goes up against a reboot in the new Conan the Barbarian. Does our hero prevail? Sort of — though one cannot doubt our hero’s fierce masculinity, not even the manliest of warriors can overcome a shoddy script and limpid storyline.
On the fantasy continent of Hyboria, Conan grows up as a happy-go-lucky barbarian preteen, who gleefully decapitates marauders and can only be faulted for his overzealousness in spreading carnage. Until the ferocious warlord Khalar Zym (Stephan Lang) slaughters his village and murders his father (a self-parodying Ron Perlman).
But Zym’s not just in it for the glory. He really wants to resurrect his murdered witch-wife and gain ultimate power, with the help of his daughter Marique (Rose McGowan), sorceress of daddy issues. But necromancy has to wait, as Conan still needs to grow up.
Some 15 years later, Conan (Jason Mamoa) is a strapping young man who has had a lifetime of wild, abs-enhancing adventures. When he crosses paths with Tamara (Rachel Nichols), a beautiful monk who Zym needs for his wife’s resurrection, vengeance for his clan pays its dues.
In Conan’s quest for revenge, the film makes gleeful use of its R rating — skulls smash upon rock, horses get punched out, bones snap against clubs and limbs fly through the air in showers of gore. More questionable issues, like Zym and Marique’s creepy relationship, are explored more often than in a PG-13. But to ask the film to delve into anything deeper than the hole left by Conan’s sword is asking far too much of this action flick.
The acting is far from poor. Some may remember Mamoa as the taciturn warlord Khal Drogo in HBO’s Game of Thrones. Once again, he’s a rippling testament of strength and power, with a manly charisma similar to Dwayne Johnson’s. Of the cast, he makes the best of lines that, at their most optimistic, can best be described as cheesy.
Besides Mamoa, Nichols is equal parts feisty and flowery as Tamara. It is refreshing to see a character who, if hunted by anyone less than a crazed megalomaniac, could probably take fine care of herself.
Yet why she falls so fast for a grizzled warrior whose discourse includes “Come here, woman,” takes pages of character development we never see. Lang and McGowan also try their best as one-note villains, but corny dialogue takes down their efforts faster than Conan ever could.
A sword and sorcery film without fighting is unfit for a warrior of Cimmeria. Conan gets plenty of chances to shatter skulls and sever limbs but fights blur as the film carries on. One CGI-heavy battle against a monster serves no point other than to highlight effects that will look even worse when upgraded to 3D. Meanwhile, though Conan visits many cities, all but most resemble nothing more than cliché set pieces.
Despite a floundering screenplay, Conan has its fun parts. There is something entertaining — and perhaps cathartic — about an attractive man in minimal clothing slaughtering his enemies. The disappointment sets in when one realizes what could have been. A visceral tale of a warrior always balanced on a precipice between heroism and savagery — that could have been an all-star film. When Conan is asked what is best in life, he would answer, “To crush your enemies, see them driven before you and to hear the lamentation of their women.”
All honorable pursuits, but the film has higher expectations.

Imagine a place in the wilderness where you can ride a Ferris wheel, go on a boat ride and stand next to hundreds of other people as electronic music seemingly shakes the sky. For the attendees of Love Festival 2011 at Oak Canyon Park in Silverado, Calif., last Saturday, all of the above and more seemed a dream come true.
Crafty DJ · Paul Oakenfold was present at Love Festival for a captivating set that included a slew of cleverly mashed-up hits and bass accompaniments that excited the crowd and kept people dancing the whole night. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The 18-and-over event defied eardrums from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. The sun hadn’t set, but Alexander Technique and Paul Ahi had already blasted their tunes on either side of the lake, with some top-40 hits like Swedish House Mafia’s “Save the World” floating across the grounds.
Alex Kenji was setting the tone with his energetic house music for the next few hours of frenzy. As he generously doled out insanely deep bass beats, each dancer on the grass became an exhibitionist — there was shuffling, slick maneuvering of lit objects and finger gloves, along with everything in between.
Kenji’s sounds could be felt everywhere, each bass note more furious than the one before, making the outdoor venue feel like an indoor one. At times, the bass was overwhelming, back-to-back notes creating an indigestible beat that put the crowd a little out of it.
Kenji’s mix of Nadia Ali’s “Pressure,” on the other hand, was an infectious tune. The tempo was just right, the bass placed expertly. And by the time Kenji delivered a mix with lyrics from System of a Down’s “B.Y.O.B.” the crowd really was “dancing in the desert” per the song’s trademark lyrics.
Marc Schossow also connected with the crowd through his remix of “Sun & Moon” by Above & Beyond with its infectious yet sentimental lyrics. The heartfelt words “I’ll never get over you / you’ll never get over me” meshed well with the variegated electronic sounds. Schossow’s set put less emphasis on bass, creating a faster yet more trance-like sound that made the crowd dance in sync.
Funkagenda maintained the energy of the crowd as he delivered his dubstep-infused remix of Nero’s “Innocence,” which created a particularly Kodak-worthy moment. He cleverly calmed down the tune before bringing in a sprinkle of snare drum sounds and swiftly sneaking in some veritable dubstep beats. The lights got brighter and you could hear the crowd’s sudden, simultaneous excitement before they dove into the rhythm with arms, legs and hips swaying. The crowd emitted an energy unique to electronic music events, and Funkagenda stood waving his arms and singing as if he were in the crowd.
Though he was less energetic and hardly interacted with the crowd, Felix da Housecat treated fans to an intriguing mix of “Psychokiller” by Talking Heads. David Byrne’s voice made up most of the song, and Felix used bass notes to compliment his singing. Felix continued by riding a retro wave as he remixed Depeche Mode’s “Personal Jesus,” a track that melded well with Felix’s penchant for bold sounds.
Despite Felix da Housecat’s showy sounds, it was Paul Oakenfold who stole the show by expertly building up the tension before launching into an hour and a half of energetic, eardrum-rattling music, driving the crowd completely wild.
Oakenfold cleverly crafted notes from Red Hot Chili Pepper’s “Otherside” into his mix and transported Anthony Kiedis’ voice into different heights as he meshed it with bass notes you could feel in your bones. An incorporation of The White Stripes’ “Seven Nation Army” famous riff didn’t have a terribly exciting payoff, but his remix of Eurythmic’s “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)” included repetition of the main line plus a passionate expletive before launching into an intense beat that got the crowd the wildest it had been all night.
Love Festival came to an end with the fast-paced tunes of L.A. Riots in a set that started with the words “I’m a freak like you / you’re a freak like me,” a statement that seemed to sum up the communal energy of the hundreds of strangers dancing into Sunday morning side-by-side.

Last spring The Row was put on social prohibition. Though a social ban looks good by the book in that it shows clear steps on the administration’s part in response to a number of incidents, such measures are ineffective at actually solving the problems they are designed to address.
Alan Wong | Daily Trojan
Such bans attempt to shift students’ personal responsibility from the individual to the institution.
Trying to usurp student autonomy is not only resented by many students, but is also damaging to the reputation of the university.
By exerting authority over non-academic aspects of students’ lives, the university takes additional responsibility for incidents when they occur.
Though relinquishing attempts to control student social life might result in the proliferation of activity deemed irresponsible, it will encourage students to recognize their part in determining their own safety and their roles as representative units of the Trojan Family.
This doesn’t mean advocating the abolition of DPS or delving into the controversial realms of health care.
The issue is attempting to impose safety measures on activities and events that by their very nature are hazardous.
Walking around campus safely or returning home to an apartment just off campus under the protection of DPS is one thing.
But  attempting to regulate drinking and other activities need not be in the jurisdiction of USC’s safety concerns.
Employing a kind-of sandbox philosophy, students are able to experiment and learn.
USC gives students a sort of sandbox for social experimentation: filling buckets with condoms, having numerous areas to smoke cigarettes and having a certain degree of leniency with regard to underage drinking.
A better policy would be to abandon the sandbox altogether, as pursuing middle-of-the-road approach sends mixed messages.
If USC is to encourage more liberal thought and promote more exploration and experimentation, it must also be prepared to ask students to take more personal responsibility.
Increased personal responsibility is, after all, the price of freedom.. Taking steps to control students unnecessarily while also promoting freedom and exploration puts the university in the precarious position of taking responsibility for controlling the uncontrollable.
The choice between promoting freedom or promoting conformity should be the university’s approach in addressing such issues.
Taking either of these approaches alone, however, would be rejected.
What, then, should the university do regarding the many social-related issues that arise among students?
As a university, education is a top priority and is one of the best tools parents and faculty members have to ensure the safety of students. If students are well educated about the reasons that led to last year’s social prohibition, then the university has done its part for ensuring student safety.
At that point, students would be making educated decisions, whether or not those decisions are good or bad.
It is better to be more proactive than reactive. USC doesn’t need to react to all the social ills if it believes students are making educated decisions, even if they make poor ones anyway.
A primary emphasis of the university should be to continue to provide students with the tools needed to make informed decisions.
But recognizing the areas over which the university as an institution  has control over is essential to addressing any issue.

Thank you for a well thought article. The university needs to remember that the students are, for the most part, adults individually accountable for their choices, (and if they are underage, they are their parents responsibility, not the university’s). The closing down of the row because some students don’t behave well, is like closing down the senate because some senators are corrupt!!
The greek system is an important aspect of student life, greek and non-greek, stigmatizing it, does not help the university administration or the students!!!

Ah, Welcome Week: The time for freshmen to engage in academic, social and spirit activities to adapt to USC.  The events, characterized by low turnout, were not exactly the way I envisioned college to be.
As the bright orange bins and oversized suitcases rolled into the lobbies of residence halls, students across campus shook hands with their roommates and hugged their parents goodbye.
After unpacking boxes, tucking in new bed comforters and figuring out how to hang a cork board without putting holes in the walls, undergraduates were now faced with the diverse options of Welcome Week.
I strolled with low expectations to the Taste of Annenberg event.They soon slapped a nametag on my chest that allowed me not only to meet fellow students in my major but explore the variety of clubs and organizations within it.
Though it seemed too early to start learning, the quirky micro-seminars offered were sure to get undergraduates excited. From “Comedy as Social Critique” to “The Ethics of Lord of the Rings,” these micro-seminars covered so many topics of interest that it was impossible not to enjoy it. This, however, did not stop a large portion of freshmen from abstaining from these workshops simply because they were not required.
Four of my own suitemates preferred to sleep in an hour later rather than take advantage of the offered seminars.
Nonetheless, the week had its fair share of instructions as well as entertainment with the SPARK! multimedia showcase, a job fair and a powerful performance on the effects of sexual assault. The dive-in movie made me jealous I wasn’t brave enough to hop into the pool and watch Easy A from the comforts of an inner tube.
Hundreds of undergraduates gathered for the highlighter party to shuffle, dougie and inevitably grind to the top-40 hits produced by the afro-adorned DJ.
The turnout yet again was not as big as it could have been. Perhaps this was because the eager freshmen enthusiastic to “check out” The Row or experience their first genuinecollege party.
The Office of Campus Activities brought local vendors to McCarthy Quad to host a gift-giving carnival, but a lack of attendance caused several to leave early and seek other entertainment.
Though the indie-rock group Tokyo Police Club brought USC students to their feet with their hits “Tessellate” and “Favourite Color,” some students still felt a bigger headliner could have played, given the school’s finances.
I was the girl hesitant to start new friendships and attend “freshman” events, but for the events I did attend I was satisfied.
Despite lackluster turnouts in some events, all the functions met their intention of gathering freshmen and acclimating them to their new campus — not enabling them to figure out who is the go-to booze guy.
Never before could I walk into someone’s room and introduce myself or ask somebody’s major in an elevator.
Welcome Week made this possible, and more importantly it made it OK.
We all have plenty of time to party or even study, but Welcome Week is the one time of the year that a group of incoming students can experience the start of their new lives together.
The class of 2015 simply did not take advantage of it.

This so poorly written and after reading it, I have no clue what this freshman’s view on USC’s welcome week actualy is. But why should I care?
Welcome to USC! Fight On!

2011 has been the year of protest. News reports, photos, videos, blog posts and conversations on the revolutions in the Middle East — Egypt, Libya, Syria, Tunisia — dominated the world’s airwaves this year, but, they were not the only revolutions taking place.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Spurred by economic crisis and anti-government sentiment, the 15-M youth protest movement was born in Spain in early 2011 and has since swept all of Europe. 15-M stands for May 15, the day the movement’s first protest was held under its defining motto: “Europe for citizens and not for the markets: We are not goods in the hands of politicians and bankers.”
We have much to learn from the energy, tenacity and powerful spirit of the 15-M youth movement.
Spanish youth, from 15 to 24, currently face an unemployment rate of around 40-45 percent, the highest in Europe. They are distrustful and doubtful of their political leaders. They are highly educated and motivated, yet overqualified for the low-level jobs available in a suffering economy. Their unemployment leaves them without true financial and personal independence and projects an image of apathetic disinterest.
Although the American youth’s economic situation is not as desperate as Spain’s, we are facing a very similar situation with an uncertain future brought on by economic crisis.
Spain and the United States have fallen on hard economic times, with every generation feeling the impact in some form.
For American college students, the recession has prompted many unanswered questions. How will we pay back our student loans? Can our family support four remaining years at school, especially somewhere as expensive as USC? Will there be jobs available for us in six months, one year or even two after we graduate?
Both countries suffer from a disconnect between government and people. In Spain, young people feel their political leaders’ priorities do not line up with their own. In the United States, as a result of the increasingly polarized political climate, Americans of every age have become disillusioned with and distrustful of our leaders.
Many of the 15-M protesters have graduated from university and are dealing with these problems not through apathy or brute force (as some politicians and members of older generations like to think), but with organized and spirited protest.
The youth have taken to the streets. Hundreds of people in Madrid spent the majority of the summer camped out in the physical and symbolic center of the city, Puerta del Sol, as a stage for their desperate call for social and political change. 15-M has a website, complete with a manifesto that demands unity, democracy and protection of inalienable rights and rejects any political affiliation. Much of the movement has been driven, organized and unified by this website, along with Twitter, Facebook and local blogs.
There’s something undeniably exciting and empowering about so many young people joining together in protest.
Again, we’re fortunate that the United States youth unemployment rate (about 17.4 percent) is much lower than Spain’s, but as future members of a stagnant job market, we face a similarly problematic future.
But young people across the world have refused to take these problems lying down. They have made themselves heard.
There might not be much we can do about the economic crisis or bipartisanship in government, but what we can do is continue our education and find ways to stay active and interested.
Spanish youth might be jobless, but they are educated. They know how to organize, to unify and to protest.
Granted, we’re not at the same breaking point of protest, but we should also have the same skills.
You don’t need to pitch a tent for months in McCarthy Quad or Downtown Los Angeles to be heard, but get involved in something you’re interested in where you can find your voice.
Join a club, volunteer for a political candidate’s upcoming campaign, apply to write for the newspaper. Chances are, being proactive now, even on the smallest level, could be the thing to secure you a job further down the line.
In an increasingly polarized and challenging social, political and economic environment, maintaining your own intellectual and personal independence by being curious and speaking up is more critical than ever.

This is actually excellent commentary. I’m glad I read it!
I researched the question of who “High Speed Universities” admits, their retention rates, and graduates, and I have to say that a school that is just looking for enrollment, would not hold these types of numbers. You can research this information yourself.

Vice President Joe Biden’s four-day visit to China, constituting a significant portion of his nine-day diplomatic tour in Asia, ended this past Sunday. The purpose of the visit was to build ties with Chinese Vice President Xi Jingping, who is expected to be China’s next leader, and to further emphasize the long-term partnership between the United States and China.
Biden’s trip to China, which comes almost two years after President Obama’s, highlights the increasingly important role China plays as a long-term strategic partner to the United States.
Biden visited both Sichuan University and a local school rebuilt after the Sichuan earthquake in the city of Dujiangyan on the final day of his tour, where his speeches touched on mutual cooperation between the two countries and how innovation and freedom of ideas have made the United States the successful country it is today.
Biden also briefly touched upon the sensitive topic of China’s human rights record, calling it a hindrance to economic growth.
Biden previously held two days of formal talks with Xi in Beijing, where he assured the future leader the U.S. economy was still sound in light of its recent budget issues, and the Chinese need not worry about the safety of their investments due to the recent downgrading of the U.S. credit rating.
In addition to the part China plays as a key diplomatic and economic partner, the country is also a top source of exchange and international students in the United States, with more than 18 percent of U.S. international students hailing from China. Reflecting this trend, China is one of the top sources of international students at USC.
The university has also recognized the vital role China will play going forward, establishing the USC US-China Institute in 2007. The purpose of the Institute is to enhance understanding of the US-China relationship through research, graduate and undergraduate training, events and professional development initiatives.

If you need a relaxing way to celebrate a successful move-in week, look no further to break in your new Mac DVD player or minuscule Ikea couch: The Smurfs puts a modern spin on a classic childhood favorite. Not only is it the beautiful lovechild of live-action and animation, but the comedy is also in 3D.
When evil wizard Gargamel (Frank Azaria) chases the Smurfs out of their village in an attempt to capture and use them as part of a spell to turn lead into gold, the Smurfs are magically forced through a portal, out of their world and into 21st century New York’s Central Park. With the help of Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) and his wife Grace (Jayma Mays), the quirky and lovable team must find a way to get back to their village before Gargamel tracks them down again.
Oh, my Smurf, will they succeed? Or will it be the end for our blue friends? Special guest voices include Saturday Night Live‘s Fred Armisen and Kenan Thompson as Brainy Smurf and Greedy Smurf, Katy Perry as Smurfette, George Lopez as Grouchy Smurf and Paul “Pee-Wee” Herman Reuben as Jokey Smurf. As reported to prepare for his role as Grouchy Smurf, George Lopez did not drink coffee, made sure he had bad breath and chose the busiest time to get to the studio. The movie also gave birth to two new members, Crazy Smurf and Narrator Smurf.
The movie is so smurfing sweet you’ll have a smurfing time reliving your childhood days. To make the movie more suited to its PG rating, all curse words are replaced by the word “smurf.” There are pop culture references to Lethal Weapon, Braveheart, Brokeback Mountain, Midnight Cowboy and a musical number with the song “Walk This Way” by RUN-DMC.
The Smurfs is an adventurous tale of sparkles and joy, with a heartwarming message to love everyone for who they are and to believe in yourself. So “What do you get when you cross a Smurf with a cow?” Run to your local theatre and watch this fun, adorable movie to find out!
