Committed music consumers understand the invigorating anticipation that comes from waiting for 9 p.m. Thursday to finally stream the music releases that have marked our calendars for weeks. It’s a weekly ritual and the only time where we can consume music in the most raw way — before major reviews are released and opinions are shared all over social media. Here are three projects you should include in your Friday’s listening plans.
Aminé – TWOPOINTFIVE
After a very successful release of his sophomore studio album, “Limbo,” in 2020, Portland rapper Aminé is back and ready to charm his listeners with “TWOPOINTFIVE.” “Limbo” came out when the world was still working from home and concerts were nonexistent, and yet, the album faced critical success and made Aminé’s wittiness and expertise as a rapper evident. It’s difficult to remember this is the same rapper that garnered attention for his hit “Caroline” in 2017, but it’s been a pleasure to witness his growth both in life and as an artist. After releasing “Charmander,” his first single since “Limbo,” less than two weeks ago, Aminé announced on Twitter Wednesday his next project is ready for release. Despite the short rollout, the rapper has not failed to garner considerable attention for his mixtape whose title seems to play off of his 2018 mixtape “ONEPOINTFIVE.” If the project is anything like the single, it will be filled with experimental beats, different textures and endless double entendres. Whether or not you’re an avid Aminé listener, there is a certain sound he has mastered, and there’s no doubt his music is filled with wit and self-awareness. 
Terrace Martin – DRONES
If Terrace Martin isn’t on your radar yet, it’s definitely time to add him. The three-time Grammy nominated artist, producer and multi-instrumentalist from Crenshaw is renowned in the music industry as one of the top jazz musicians and has produced some of Los Angeles’ most influential hip hop works. Under his record label Sounds of Crenshaw, “DRONES’ will undoubtedly highlight all of Martin’s assets, from his smooth voice to the incredible notes he plays on saxophone, piano and more. The 13-track album features an incredible roster of features, from Kendrick Lamar and Smino to Channel Tres and Kamasi Washington and so many more. The stacked list of contributors guarantee that this project deserves a listen-through from everyone. 
Summer Walker – Still Over It
There’s no doubt that fans of Summer Walker’s debut album “Over It” are incredibly excited for the R&B singer’s sequel project. From memes circulating on Twitter to many fans relating to the notion of the album’s title, “Still Over It” will definitely be a popular stream today. While many music consumers might argue that the R&B scene is lackluster nowadays, Summer’s “Over It” was successful in proving that wrong. She captures the reality of lust and messiness that comes with relationships in a slow and sultry way. Although this highly anticipated project plays on the album’s name, the single “Ex For A Reason” suggests that the album might reflect a new sound for the singer — and hopefully it works.

“Work hard, play hard.” That’s the mentality most people at USC tend to have. We are trained to think that, if you are not spending every hour of your day doing something productive, you are wasting time.  
It might be impossible to retrain our brains to think otherwise, but have no fear, a 13-year-old pug named Noodles reminds us that it’s OK to slow down and take time for yourself. 
This sounds completely bizarre if you have not seen the videos of Noodles going viral on TikTok, but this dog has become the new version of Co-Star, the astrology app that gives your daily horoscope. 
Every day Jonathan Graziano, or @jongraz, posts a video of another round of ‘no bones.’ As he likes to put it: “The game where we find out if my 13-year-old pug woke up with bones and, as a result, we’ll find out what kind of day we’re going to have.”
You might be wondering, what exactly does that even mean? Well, first, let’s get one thing straight — Jonathan does not mean his dog literally wakes up with or without bones. Second, there are two possible outcomes to Jonathan’s videos. It is either a “bones day” or a “no bones day.”
If Noodles stands up firmly in his dog bed, it is a “bones day.” If Noodles sinks into his dog bed, slipping through his owner’s fingers as if he were an actual noodle, then it is a “no bones” day. 
A “bones day” is a good thing, a day to get stuff done, get your life together and, well, girlboss. “No bones day” are not bad, but rather they are days where you should take a minute to breathe. Take care of yourself, your mental health and just treat yourself to the things that make you happy. 
These days, people have attributed their good days to Noodles having a “bones” day and their not-so-good days to Noodles having a “no bones” day.
Take Gaurav’s (@gvedak) tweet, for example, where he predicted the World Series based off of Noodles’ forecast of a “bones” or “no bones” day.
“Past two Braves wins against the Dodgers have been on bones days, and after no bones day yesterday, we are back to a bones day,” wrote Gaurav on Twitter. “What this all is leading me to say is, Braves in 6.”
(We should take a note from Gaurav’s book and attribute any USC football wins or losses to Noodles’ bones forecast.)
So, why did I decide to write about a 13-year-old dog who happens to get millions of views on TikTok when I could have written about anything else?
While “bones” and “no bones” day seem like it is all fun and games, Noodles’ daily videos give us the perfect reminder of the importance of mental health.
The last year and a half has taken a real toll on our bodies, especially mentally. Being stuck inside, logging on to Zoom call after Zoom call and most of all losing out on a significant experience of our life — college. 
Trying to function like everything is OK in the middle of a pandemic is really difficult. Our schools and jobs tell us it is okay to return to normal and be in-person, but it isn’t the same. Masks, Trojan Checks and weekly coronavirus tests remind us of that. 
On top of the pandemic, learning of the trauma faced by members of our USC community, like what we have seen in the past week, adds extra weight to the hurt we push ourselves through everyday. 
Mental health is not an easy subject to discuss and many people do not feel comfortable talking about it with their friends. I think Noodles has provided a great icebreaker to have these conversations; that is, we can ask people if they are having a “bones” or “no bones” day, week or month. 
While their response may be short, it will say a lot. From there we can provide support, comfort and encouragement to those we love. 
Not only that, don’t limit yourself to just asking your friends; we can’t forget to ask ourselves if we’re having a “no bones” or “bones” day. It is just as important to evaluate your own mental health on a regular basis because that is just as valuable. 
What is cool about a “bones” or “no bones” check in is that it can be added to your daily or weekly routine and it takes such a short time. It provides a less daunting way to reflect on yourself while also being a great way to help stabilize your own mental health. 
No, Noodles’ forecasts won’t be the end all be all of our days, but I do think they will be a small reminder of how important it is to take care of yourself — something we all probably struggle to do.

As the days get shorter and the weather gets colder, it’s the perfect time to stay in and watch some TV shows and movies. Yes, we are in the middle of the last month of the semester crunch, but everyone deserves a break sometimes. You may as well procrastinate with the latest and greatest in the ever-growing world of streaming. 

Disney+ 

“Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” —  arriving Nov. 12
If you missed your chance to see “Shang-Chi” in theaters, then you are in luck! The movie will arrive to Disney+ on Nov. 12. 
Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) sets off to stop the world domination of the Ten Rings organization, run by his father, Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung). While the movie provides some great martial arts action, it also tells a great story about family and loss.   
Whether you are a Marvel fanatic, casual viewer or totally new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, “Shang-Chi” is a must see. The 25th movie in the franchise also features the first Asian superhero to become a part of the MCU. 

HBO Max 

“King Richard” —  arriving Nov. 19
Will Smith stars as Richard Williams, the father of tennis legends Serena (Demi Singleton) and Venus Williams (Saniyya Sidney). The movie follows Richard’s dedication to push his daughters to greatness despite the barriers of tennis’ elitist past. 
“King Richard” delivers all the inspirational monologues one could hope for with a sports movie plus some pretty amazing performances. It is also a heartwarming love letter to their father from producers Serena and Venus. If you are feeling a bit down, this is the perfect movie to use as a pick-me-up. 

Netflix 

“Tiger King” season 2 — arriving Nov. 17
April 2020, what a time. Whipped coffee, wiping down groceries, a transition to Zoom and of course, “Tiger King.” The Netflix sensation reached 64 million views within the first month of its premiere. Now, Netflix is releasing an update to its smash hit. 
The new season will be an update on most of the eccentric characters of season 1. You can still expect the same craziness in the eight-episode run of season 2 with looks of Joe Exotic in prison, the zoo under Jeff Lowe’s control and the movement to get Exotic out of prison. However, it is likely you will not see much of Carole Baskin as she is in the process of suing Netflix for using her image in the promo. 
“Cowboy Bebop” — arriving Nov. 19
Often considered one of the greatest anime series of all time, “Cowboy Bebop” (1998) is getting a live-action remake on Netflix. Don’t turn away just yet! Remakes very rarely come close to the originals in quality, and, based on the teaser, it’s doubtful “Cowboy Bebop” will either. 
However, creator André Nemac said the show will be “an expansion to the cannon” rather than a straight remake. It does promise to keep the same genre-crossing noir, western, sci-fi style of the original, the same musical excellence and, of course, Ein. 
Maybe you’ll hate it, maybe you’ll love it, but, if anything, it’s a good reason to watch or rewatch the original anime (which is also on Netflix). 
“Selling Sunset” season 4 — arriving Nov. 24
Reality TV lovers should rejoice at the return of Netflix’s cult classic. Three seasons and 24 episodes later, “Selling Sunset” provides viewers an inside look into the world of elite real estate in the Los Angeles area and all the petty drama you could hope from a reality TV series. 
Season 4 is one to watch out for as it promises babies, engagements, flings and a falling out between two formerly close brothers. Christine Quinn, a controversial star of the show, even called it “the juiciest season ever.” 

Hulu

“The Great” season 2 — arriving Nov. 19 
Season 1 of “The Great,” loosely based on the life of Catherine the Great, followed Catherine (Elle Fanning) in her fight to take the Russian throne from her husband (Nicholas Hoult). The intelligent comedy and visually appealing aesthetic of the show made it a refreshing take on a usually serious period drama. 
Now, season 2 is coming out, and there is a lot happening. Catherine has the throne, is pregnant with a baby from an affair and is also reconnecting with her husband who is now her prisoner. It is definitely a show you need to watch to believe.

No. 2 USC has battled many top ranked opponents this season and has defeated all but one of them. Arguably its toughest opponent yet will come Saturday in No. 1 UCLA. 
The last time the Trojans matched up against the Bruins was in last year’s national championship game, where UCLA won 7-6 in a highly contested match. USC will look for revenge, hoping to beat its rivals on senior night and pick up its 16th win of the season and another vital MPSF conference win in the process.
The Trojans are familiar with the Bruins, having played them six total times last season and splitting the matchups 3-3. The Bruins got the most important victory claiming the national championship.
Both teams have only lost one game this season. UCLA is currently on a seven-game win streak, while the Trojans hope to get their fifth straight win this weekend. 
The game this weekend could be a low scoring affair. In the last six games between the two teams, the average combined goals was a little more than 15.5. USC averages about 15.8 goals scored per game this season, and defense will be essential Saturday.
Head Coach Marko Pintaric highlighted what the Trojans need to do Saturday.
“Just to bring that intensity and refuse to lose attitude that we’ve been having so far this season, and then to execute our game plan,” said Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I think we’re matched up very well against UCLA and we’ll see how it’s gonna play out this weekend.”
The preparation going into this week for the team has been more intense than usual, knowing how vital the game will be for the team. 
“UCLA is always a team that studies us really well; they know what we run and they’ve watched all the games,” senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt said. “We have to do everything perfect this game if we want to win it.”
The Trojans will hope for another impressive performance this week after getting a big win against No. 7 UCSB. USC held the lead for the entire game and tightened up its defense that helped contribute to a strong win against Santa Barbara. 
Redshirt senior driver Jacob Mercep had another hat-trick in the game as he continued his dominant scoring season for the Trojans — he leads the team with 41 goals. The Trojans are now tied for the No. 2 spot with Berkeley because of the win.
Mercep got rewarded for his good play in the game by receiving the MPSF Player of the Week award for his first time this season and for the fifth time in his career. Mercep needs seven more goals to be one of 20 players to reach the 200 career goal mark in MPSF history.
Saturday’s matchup is also senior night with many players on men’s water polo playing their last home game for the Trojans. 
USC will honor eight players at the game on Saturday: goalie Nic Porter, driver Jacob Mercep, 2-meter James Kolenda, utility Alexander Lansill, driver Matt Harrison, driver Marko Karaman, 2-meter Wyatt Barker and driver Bennett Winther. 
The seniors and those leaving the team will be honored throughout the game to commemorate their time at USC.
Porter as a player who approaches his last home game, said he hopes it will end on a high note with the team defeating UCLA.
“It would be a culmination of our entire USC careers,” Porter said. “It would honestly mean everything to all of us to get this win.”
No. 2 USC hosts No. 1 UCLA Saturday at 1 p.m. at Uytengsu.

USC will travel to play Arizona State on the road Saturday in a Pac-12 South showdown. 
The Trojans have won five of the last six matchups between the two schools. However, USC is 10-7 when playing the Sun Devils in Tempe. 
The Trojans are coming off a 41-34 victory against Arizona at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The win was USC’s first Pac-12 home victory of the season. Arizona State is in the middle of a poor stretch, having given up 56 unanswered points in two straight losses. 
The Sun Devils led 21-0 against Utah on the road Oct. 16 but lost 35-21. Last week at home, after a bye week, Arizona State turned it over on its first three drives en route to a 34-21 loss against Washington State. 
Junior quarterback Kedon Slovis and freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart split reps against Arizona. When asked about Arizona State, interim Head Coach Donte Williams didn’t reveal to media that would happen again this week.
“We’ll continue to assess that as it gets closer and closer to game time,” said Williams Monday after practice. “Arizona State provides certain issues that we got to make sure we’re able to handle.” 
Williams suggested Thursday that Slovis and Dart will both play Saturday, but much is still up in the air. 
Offensive Coordinator Graham Harrell shied away from calling the quarterback situation a competition. 
“[Slovis and Dart are] two players who played a really high level and both are doing good things,” said Harrell Monday after practice. “We’ll figure it out and put them in there and expect to score regardless of who’s in the game.”  
The Sun Devils allow the second-fewest yards per game in the Pac-12 with 331.1, including under 200 passing and rushing yards per game. However, in their past two losses, Arizona State has given up more than 400 yards each to Utah and Washington State.
USC’s offense will be without its leading junior receiver Drake London, who fractured his ankle and is out for the season. London’s absence brought questions about Trojans leaning more on senior running back Keaontay Ingram, who ran for a career-high 204 rushing yards against Arizona. 
Harrell said Ingram will be the focal point, but others will be involved heavily too.
“We got a lot of good guys and a lot of special players, and we’ll continue to try to put them in space with the football and then just let them go be them,” Harrell said. “That’s kind of the philosophy of this offense, put your playmakers in space with the ball.”
The Sun Devils will be welcoming back their top senior running back Rachaad White, who leads Arizona State with 483 yards rushing and 9 touchdowns. 
White returns to a loaded backfield with dual-threat junior quarterback Jayden Daniels and running backs sophomore DeaMonte Trayanum and freshman Daniyel Ngata.
All four can pose threats to USC’s run defense that allows the sixth-fewest rushing yards in the Pac-12 with 148.4 per game. Arizona State is fourth in the Pac-12 with 193.9 rushing yards per game but has failed to eclipse 150 yards rushing in its last two losses.
“[The running backs] have gone up another level. They all run hard,” Defensive Coordinator Todd Orlando said Wednesday after practice. “And there’s competition. When you’re competing against somebody that can take your job and you’ve got three guys that can do it. They’re all firing.”
The matchup between the Trojans and Sun Devils’ kicks off Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in Tempe, Ariz.

Los Angeles Lakers forward Carmelo Anthony was out of a job just two years ago. 
Yes, Carmelo Anthony. 
A 10-time All-Star, the ninth all-time leading scorer in the NBA and a six-time All-NBA selection was not picked up by a single team for an entire year when he was released in 2019 after 10 games with the Houston Rockets.
Not even LeBron James, one of Anthony’s closest friends, asked the Lakers, who missed the playoffs in the 2018-19 season, to sign Anthony despite having a stronghold on the front office’s roster decisions. 
James warmed up to the idea of teaming up with Anthony in the latest offseason, telling the 10-time All-Star, “The time is now. We’ve got to make it happen.”
It seems as though every time James powers his way to the rim for an emphatic slam or rises up for one of his patented chase-down blocks, the commentators always add in awe, “He’s in year 19!” What James is doing is absolutely unprecedented, but let’s not forget that Anthony was in the same draft class as James, just two picks later. 
Anthony, too, is reaching uncharted territory. Not only is he in his 19th season at age 37, but he also spent a year away from NBA basketball. He had to pull himself back into game shape, readjust to the game speed and find his groove again. 
Luckily for Anthony, the guy is a professional scorer. So often under the bright lights of Staples Center in Los Angeles, we see players not built for the center stage, with their shooting percentages dramatically decreasing. 
It’s a different story with Anthony, who is no stranger to the spotlight, having played six seasons at Madison Square Garden in New York. Eight games into the season, Anthony has 24 buckets from behind the arc, the fourth most in the league. 
He’s averaging 16.5 points per game on ridiculous efficiency: 51.5% from the field and 52.9% from three. He’s actually starting to look like “Hoodie Melo” from his famed 2017 workout videos. 
The scariest thing about Anthony’s efficiency is that he could actually keep it up. I know 52.9% from three sounds absurd, but I don’t think Anthony hanging around 48-50% is that outrageous, something only a handful of players have done in league history. 
Night in and night out, Anthony is getting quality looks. Keep in mind, this is a guy that used to be a superstar; he has seen heavy contests and double teams his entire life. He’s not used to being wide open on a consistent basis. 
He’s second in the league in catch-and-shoot three pointers made per game with 2.8, shooting 51.2% on those shots. Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis and James attract so much attention, opponents forget about three-time gold medalist Anthony sitting wide open in the corner. 
And you know how that goes. 
But he’s not just a standstill shooter 19 years into his career. Anthony is still a hefty 6-foot-7, 240-pound guy with an absolute dagger of a turnaround fadeaway. 
When he has a mismatch, he lumbers into the post while the Lakers space to the weak side. James probably stands at half court, conserving energy because even he knows Anthony’s throwing a shot up. We know, the defender knows, the crowd knows, but Anthony has been in the business for too long — he knows exactly how to get the shot he wants. 
His ability to take advantage of mismatches will be huge in a playoff environment when teams start to switch pick and rolls more regularly. He’s not afraid of taking the big shot either — he’s connected on 27 game-winning shots in his career. 
The question will be whether Anthony can keep up defensively. He still has quick hands and is sufficient guarding the post, but he isn’t the quickest in space, susceptible to blow bys that break down the defense. Teams are prone to hunting him in pick and rolls too. 
But Davis and James must figure out how to overcome Anthony’s defensive shortcomings because his floor spacing is so valuable. If he can maintain his current three-point rate, he could be a dark horse candidate for the Sixth Man of the Year award. 
And you’re telling me no one could have used this guy two years ago?

Without reliable transportation to pick up food and groceries and limited time to grocery shop, many students are reliant on University-provided meal plans in order to eat every day. For students such as Tyler Polarek, having a meal plan is “essential.” 
“It allows for you to be able to grab something to eat in situations where getting food isn’t feasible,” said Polarek, a sophomore majoring in business administration and sociology. “I know when I’m running late and need to grab something, the meal plan helps me the most.” 
All students living in USC Housing are required to purchase a meal plan, with freshmen living in first-year housing required to purchase the Cardinal Plan and upperclassmen living in on-campus apartments required to purchase the Apartment Plan at minimum. 
This year, USC stopped allowing students to purchase an unlimited dining plan, instead offering students 19 meal-swipes a week.
Currently the main three meal plans at USC — the Cardinal Plan, Gold Plan and Trojan Plan — cost $3,315, $3,725 and $3,900 per semester, respectively. Compared to the University of Miami, Stanford University, New York University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Boston University, Chapman University and San José State University, USC has one of the most cost-effective meal plans and offers the third-lowest price per meal compared to these seven universities. These schools were selected for comparison as they each have some similar demographics to USC, including undergraduate enrollment, location and type of institution.
University of Southern California
USC is a private university in Los Angeles, Calif. with an undergraduate enrollment of 19,606 students in 2020.
The standard meal plan for students living on campus, the Cardinal Plan, costs $3,315 per semester and offers a total of 361 meal swipes, valuing each meal at $9.18. A meal swipe allows a student to purchase any meal from one of USC’s three dining halls and 11 additional USC Hospitality locations.
The Gold Plan, which is identical to the Cardinal Plan but with the addition of $500 Dining Dollars, costs $3,725. With this plan costing only $410 more that the Cardinal Plan, $90 worth of Dining Dollars are provided at no extra cost. Both the Cardinal and Gold Plans include seven guest swipes per semester. The Trojan Meal Plan is a full Dining Dollar Plan, with $3,900 Dining Dollars costing $3,900. Dining Dollars are bonus money added to a student’s ID card that allow students to buy meals at retail dining locations on campus.
In addition to these three plans, USC also offers plans to students who live in on-campus apartments or off-campus and aren’t eating every meal in the dining halls — the Apartment, Community 25 and Community 50 Plans. The Apartment Plan, which is only available to students living in USC Housing Apartments, includes 40 meal swipes and $150 Dining Dollars for $705, valuing each meal at $13.88. 
“I think [the Apartment Plan is] OK, but I don’t think it’s a good rate of return,” Polarek said. “How do you get your money’s worth out of it?” 
For Mary Ikeocha, a sophomore majoring in psychology who also has the Apartment Plan, her meal plan is “kind of worth it” because of the options outside of the three dining halls that her plan covers, such as the eateries at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. 
“[The Apartment Plan] is the least costly plan, so I guess it’s good that they have an option that’s not as expensive as the other ones,” she said. “I’m glad you can use it in other places that [aren’t] exactly the dining halls.”
USC does not currently offer an unlimited meal plan.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Executive Director of USC Hospitality and USC Hotel Dirk de Jong wrote that the University “constantly [evaluates] and [analyzes] traffic patterns and our data to ensure any changes to the plan reflects the needs and interests of our students.” 
de Jong also added that meal plans offer students substantial discounts at retail venues when paying with a meal swipe as opposed to cash. 
“The [swipes included in the Cardinal Plan represent] significant savings for each meal, since the cash equivalent for breakfast, lunch and dinner in the residential dining halls is significantly higher, as well as providing savings with the meal swipe combos offered in the retail venues,” de Jong wrote. “With 19 meals per week, the Cardinal Plan is very similar to an unlimited meal plan, with the additional flexibility of being able to use meal swipes in our retail venues.” 
University of Miami
The University of Miami is a private university in Coral Gables, Fla. with an undergraduate enrollment of 11,334 students in 2020.
The 19-Week meal plan costs $3,400 a semester and includes 19 meals a week over an 18 week semester and $100 Dining Dollars, valuing each meal at $9.65.

Relationships and friendships are falling apart approximately 200 times faster than athletes on their electric scooters. It’s that time in the semester when everyone is tired and holding onto their sanity and patience by a sad string. 
Testing students’ sanity is a backstabbing friend who’s tossing themselves at the crush of another, a relationship held together by a $7.99 per month Disney+ subscription and a terrible heartbreak. No matter the quarrel, a fallout is bound to happen sooner or later.
As easy as it may seem to close your eyes and exile people from your mind and social media, some need guidance with the concept of “in with the new, out with the old.” Dr. Blingspice will hold your hand and guide you through the trashiest of friends, boyfriends and exes.
I met this guy freshman year and I’ve liked him ever since. One of my close friends has been making moves on him, and she definitely knows that I like him. What should I do?
Whenever she’s around, throw more hints that you like the man. Since she hasn’t received the message yet, a subtle “I would marry him if I could” or “I’m planning the proposal soon” would suffice. If she continues to flirt with him, it’s time to have a discussion with her about wanting to take your man. If she values your wishes as a friend, she’ll leave him to you.
In the case that the discussion backfires, embarrassment is always a way to maintain checks and balances. When he asks you about your friend, sabotage her chances by painting her out to be the villain without compromising his impression of you: “She doesn’t shower,” “She doesn’t like dogs” or “She tripped a toddler on purpose the other day.” A friend who doesn’t acknowledge your interests isn’t someone you want in your life. Demonize your way to a man and cut that girl out of your life. 
My partner dumped me completely out of nowhere after almost three years … How do I tell them that I’m canceling the joint Disney+ account?
Don’t cancel the account yet. Three years in a relationship can’t be thrown to waste without anything to gain. Who cares about the memories? Find their credit card information, assuming they sent it to you in the past, to treat yourself. Replace your credit card information with theirs and immediately change the password to something unguessable. Nothing should come in the way of you and a “Wizards of Waverly Place” marathon, no matter the significant other.
There’s no need to tell them you’re canceling the account if you can’t secure the bag. They deserve no warning. Simply change the password so they’re logged out of all devices and cancel the subscription. Next time they want to watch Marvel movies, they’ll wish they were still dating you.
I got my heart broken as a freshman, and it put me in a bad place for months. Now, over a year later, I’ve started developing feelings for someone else, but they hardly know I exist. I want to be more outgoing again and at least start a friendship with this person, but I worry that even the slightest feeling of disappointment or heartbreak could send me spiraling or make me lose all the progress I’ve made in my self confidence since then.
Everyone deserves happiness at least once in their life, including you. A philosopher by the name of Cher once asked, “Do you believe in life after love?” and the answer is that you should. Don’t let a sour experience ruin your perception of romance and listen to your emotions. In the long run, heartbreak and disappointment are temporary, but a friendship or a significant other can easily turn into something memorable — and perhaps even a free blueberry matcha latte from Dulce.
Disappointment is sometimes inevitable, but don’t let it ruin all prospects. You should be in a positive headspace where you have more than one source of happiness before entering a relationship where you solely rely on your partner. Depending on other people for your own joy is a set up for disappointment, which is why you have to ensure you’re prepared for a relationship. 
If you need advice, feel free to reach out to Dr. Blingspice by direct messaging Daily Trojan on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook or by submitting your questions to the Google Form on the Instagram stories.

It’s been nearly four months since my last column installment, and even longer since I last discussed my relationship with the medical field. In fact, every 10th column installment of mine has to comment on toxic pre-medicine culture — sorry, I don’t make the rules! 
All jokes aside, I actually plan on applying to medical school in June, so what better cathartic outlet for my anxieties than to write an open letter criticizing the organization in charge of my future — the Association of American Medical Colleges. 
Back in September, @AAMC_MCAT, a Twitter account that posts updates on the Medical College Admission Test, tweeted an announcement for an upcoming Virtual Fair: “Did you know more Black men applied and matriculated to #medschool in 1978 than in 2014?” 
Through this tweet, the AAMC completely undermined the socioeconomic barriers it continues to perpetuate despite its efforts to make applying to medical school more accessible. Moreover, wealth privilege and racism saturate the entirety of pre-medicine culture, which contributes to the lack of racial diversity in medical school classes. 
So I wonder, AAMC — whose fault is that? Whose fault is it that you are still overwhelmingly rich and white? 
Nonetheless, I took my MCAT last July, and the entire process milked my iced coffee and book fund. The fee to take the test was $320, which doesn’t include the preparatory materials I purchased from Kaplan and UWorld, which ended up totaling about $1,000. This price is still under the $3,149 price of an MCAT preparatory course through Princeton Review that guarantees a score of at least a 510, an 81st percentile on the MCAT. 
Not to mention the fact that medical school application costs are expensive too, with the first primary application costing $170 and the following costing $42. And as someone who comes from a middle-class background, I can afford these costs. However, what about those who do not come from privileged backgrounds? How do they possibly afford to take the MCAT and apply to medical school? 
While AAMC offers a Fee Assistance Program to students who cannot afford to take the MCAT and apply to medical school without financial aid, financial assistance programs do not exist for preparatory materials. Students can pay for private tutors and prep courses for these standardized tests and propel themselves ahead of those with less money. 
Because it implements these socioeconomic barriers, AAMC makes it even more difficult for people from less wealthy backgrounds to compete with those who not only have money but also social capital. Students whose parents are physicians already have the wealth as well as the connections to shadowing experiences that highlight them as prime candidates when applying to medical school. 
In fact, according to a study by the American Medical Association, this access to money and resume boosters works in favor of children of physicians while applying to medical school, consequently upholding the lack of diversity in medical schools with majority white and rich classes. 
However, with the MCAT, we don’t see the same movement to abolish it like we do with undergraduate college admissions exams, such as the ACT. After all, most prestigious universities, such as the University of California system and the University of Chicago, moved toward not requiring standardized tests in their admissions process. Meanwhile, the rest of the nation is still learning that the tests merely measure students’ wealth instead of their academic capabilities. The same applies to the MCAT. 
Compared to undergraduate culture, however, pre-medicine culture feels like it’s on steroids. In a previous column, I explored cutthroat pre-medicine culture and how it deprives applicants of the empathy medical schools supposedly want to foster. This lack of empathy segues to the culture’s money-hungry maneuvers, which cut off disadvantaged students from resume-building experiences that can set them apart while applying to medical school. 
For example, COPE Health Scholars, in partnership with the Keck Graduate Institute, is a volunteer program that allows students to earn clinical volunteer hours by rotating through different hospital specialties. The program has tuition, though: It costs $406 to complete in nine months. Programs such as COPE incentivize medical school applicants to pay money to “volunteer” and gain worthwhile experience for their applications. 
And we cannot possibly talk about wealth in medicine culture without discussing politics. If I get into medical school, I feel like I have to prepare myself for encountering classmates who do not believe in universal healthcare. And no, I am not being overdramatic: A 2019 survey from the Journal of Academic Medicine suggests that about 11% of medical students do not support the Affordable Care Act.  
Moreover, according to data collected by researchers at Yale, we notice an intriguing, yet unsurprising, pattern: 67% and 65% of surgeons and anesthesiologists, respectively, identify as Republicans, while the same goes for 24% and 23% of psychiatrists and infectious disease specialists, respectively. On average, surgeons and anesthesiologists earn greater salaries than psychiatrists and infectious disease specialists. 
As people’s salaries increase, they tend to shift their political ideology to the right, at least in the medical field. This pattern makes sense, especially considering billionaires who favor conservative tax policies. 
In the medical system, however, this shift is especially corruptive because it further solidifies this greedy framework that exploits undergraduates for money to volunteer and gain acceptance to medical school, only for them to drown in student loans and experience more exploitation at the hands of a doctor-deprived medical system.   
Ultimately, if the AAMC would really like to fix this problem, perhaps it could work toward uprooting this money-hungry culture instead of advertising virtual webinars. Sincerely, a prospective — and concerned — medical student.
