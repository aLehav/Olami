USC Housing is looking for ways to decrease its carbon footprint, withouth significantly increasing the cost for students.
USC Housing recently finished an evaluation of Pardee Tower to create a baseline for the university’s efforts to make USC Housing facilities more environmentally friendly.

Mark Ewalt, director of Auxiliary Services Operations, said the university decided last summer to conduct an evaluation of campus housing, and officially began the Pardee Tower’s evaluation in January.
“We picked Pardee because it has a lot of characteristics of some of the other dorms,” Ewalt said. “We’re looking at what kind of appliances and insulation we have and essentially everything you can possibly think of in an assessment. This will establish a baseline for Pardee and a model for how we should approach the complete housing portfolio.”
Ewalt said they want to work toward a Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design certification. LEED is an esteemed, internationally recognized green building certification system. The Ronald Tutor Campus Center is certified LEED Gold certification, which has helped influence USC Housing’s decision to look into LEED Certification, according to Ewalt.
“We were curious about LEED certification and how we might do something similar for existing building inventory after having gone through the Tutor Campus Center LEED process,” Ewalt said. “We are using the Pardee assessment to see if that is something we could feasibly do because LEED is extraordinarily expensive and labor intensive.”
The decision to work toward a LEED certification would be a significant one, according to Ewalt. He said housing likely won’t become more expensive if USC takes the steps to become LEED certified, but for now it has yet to be determined.
“We want to create a long-term, systematic approach to all our USC Housing remodels and renovations that incorporates the latest sustainable building and operations practices, but still fits into USC’s overall financial and budget logic,” Ewalt said.
If USC Housing pursues LEED certifications, it won’t be the first university to do so.
Carnegie Mellon University, Vanderbilt University and Washington University in St. Louis already have LEED-certified student housing, while the University of Illinois is seeking LEED Silver certification for one of its residence halls. University of Maryland plans to open a second LEED Gold certified residential facility on the campus, next fall.
“We are considering how feasible LEED certification for management of existing buildings would be,” Ewalt said. “LEED requires that you monitor, measure and report everything.”
LEED is a strict, administration-heavy program, and Ewalt said it will take at least a year and a half to make a decision.
“We might do what Stanford is doing, and create our own LEED-like program. Pardee will help us determine whether we should go LEED or do our own,” Ewalt said. “Whichever we do, that then will give us a roadmap to how we approach the rest of the housing portfolio.”
Ewalt said USC Housing is interested in lowering overall operation costs, and being more closely aligned with USC students, staff and faculty expectations about having a smaller impact on the environment.
In the interim, USC Housing is taking some immediate steps to make student housing more sustainable, though some of those steps have been more noticeable than others.
In 2010, each USC Housing resident was provided a power-saving power strip in his or her room. Those power strips reduced energy consumption an average of 7 to 12 percent each month, according to Ewalt.
USC Housing has also been using low Volatile Organic Compounds, low odor paints, new carpets partially made from recycled materials and installing low flow shower heads, water-efficient laundry machines and toilets that use less water.
“These things are not necessarily measured at this point, but we know that they have a big, positive impact,” Ewalt said.
Ewalt said that environmentally educated students, however, is most important.
“I think students could have the biggest impact by simply setting their heating to a lower temperature and their air-conditioning to a higher temperature,” Ewalt said.
Some students, however, wish the university would be in more consistent contact with students about being green.
“I feel like the school should send out an awareness email on how students can be more environmentally friendly, not just through housing, but on campus life in general,” said Connie Gao, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
Other students, however, feel the university should have other priorities besides going green.
“But I’d like to see USC expand the dorms on campus already and make them more comfortable to improve the quality of living rather than focuses solely on going green,” said Daniel Matloubian, a junior majoring in accounting.
As part of the Undergraduate Student Government’s push to make it easy for students to be green, students in large university-owned housing buildings will have access to recycling bins beginning May 6, in time for move-out.
There will be individual bins designated for food, clothing and shoes and electronic waste. The food and clothing and shoes will be donated to those in need and the “e-waste,” or electronic waste, will be processed through Californina Recycles.
Mikey Geragos, university affairs director, said the program is in place to make recycling an easy option for students.
“It gives students a good opportunity  to clean up their dorms or apartment and gives them place where they can donate or drop off their waste,” Geragos said. “It’s not something that they have to seek or search for, because it’s going to be easily accessible.”
Geragos said although USG did not start the program, sustainability advocacy has risen as a priority for USG over the past few years. Both students and the university have expressed that it is an important interest.
“There’s been a big push internally and externally to push for sustainability,” Geragos said. “It’s a direct repsonse to what students want.”

This story is the first of a series of four stories about sustainability.
So does this mean the university is going to start taking out all the TVs they’ve put in? The ones that are on 24/7?
Once USC re-does the UV over the next few years they need to turn their attention to the current dorms.  A lot of them were built in the 1970’s (at least the off-campus ones) and are not really up to current standards.  
When the UV is done and they have the flex space they should really start destroying and rebuilding dorms, as money becomes available.  Additionally, they should come up with a master plan of what they want to do with them.  For example, the dorms that are located in the block surrounded by Founders, Adams, Severance, and 28th street really should be condensed into 1 large complex and rebuilt.

As the university prepares to host the largest book festival in the country, the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, preparations are being made around campus.
Sharing · Students and workmen walk through McCarthy Quad, one of the locations where the Los Angeles Festival of Books will be held. Trousdale Parkway will also be used. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
The Festival, hosted by the Times, will bring about 400 authors and several hundred exhibitions to campus between April 30 and May 1.
The Festival has been held at UCLA for the last 15 years, but the event was moved to USC after University of California officials and event organizers disagreed on how to share expenses, particularly in light of the recent budget cuts to the UC system, according to an article in the Times in September.
President C. L. Max Nikias expressed excitement at the opportunity to host the prestigious Festival.
“Our goal is to mobilize our students, our faculty and staff, our alumni and parents to attend this event,” Nikias told USC News in February. “We want to bring 150,000 people to our campus. We want this weekend to be successful on every level.”
Some students, however, are concerned the festival might disrupt campus life, and won’t necessarily benefit students.
“I think that a lot of [non-student] locals are going to the Festival, but I feel that students are not going to get a lot out of it because they don’t know about it,” said Frank Park, a junior majoring in English and political science. “Having all of that ruckus on campus while people are trying to study … students aren’t going to like it.”
Preparations for the Festival began Friday, with tents erected Friday on McCarthy Quad and Trousdale Parkway.
Over the next few days, stages will be constructed in Founder’s Park, Argue Plaza, Alumni Park and on Trousdale.
The noise that accompanies the set-up process has not been well-received by some students.
“Even when you close the windows it can be loud, and it can get annoying when you have to study,” said Andres Park, a freshman majoring in biology who lives in Birnkrant Residential College, near McCarthy Quad.
The festival is expected to have a significant impact on the campus this weekend.
USC Transportation sent out a memo to all students last Tuesday encouraging them to prepare for heavy traffic on April 30 and May 1.
Students who commute are not looking forward to dealing with the increased traffic.
“[Though] the Festival is on the weekend, I still come to campus to study, so it’s going to be impossible to find parking,” said Frank Park, who commutes from his home in Torrance.
Students will certainly notice more crowds at campus eateries, as the Festival annually attracts a large crowd.
The agreement between the Los Angeles Times and USC to hold the annual Festival on campus is effective for the next three years.
The agreement is expected to be renewed after that, according to the Times.

Riding to the Seattle airport Saturday evening, the USC baseball team was somber and quiet, knowing it had let an opportunity to sweep a Pac-10 series slip away.
But interim coach Frank Cruz remained emphatic that the team keep its head up and move on to the next one.
Dropoff · Senior starter Logan Odom tossed just four and two-third innings on Saturday, allowing six runs on eight hits. He also hit a season-high four batters in the team’s 8-2 road loss to the Huskies. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
And by the time the team took a bus from the Los Angeles airport back to the USC campus, it was again in good spirits. After all, the Trojans had come away with a conference series win for the third-straight weekend, taking two of three games from Washington.
“I’m disappointed we didn’t win on Saturday,” Cruz said. “It’s the last taste in your mouth, so that’s what you feel. But beyond that, any time you take two of three on the road, it’s a solid weekend.”
Washington snapped the Trojans’ five-game winning streak with an 8-2 victory Saturday at Husky Ballpark after USC won the first two games 2-1 and 12-9.
Washington led 3-1 in the series finale after four innings, but blew the game open in the fifth inning when it scored five runs with two outs. Following a pair of groundouts, senior starting pitcher Logan Odom loaded the bases, allowing a pair of singles and a hit batsman.
Cruz inserted reliever freshman Kyle Richter to try to quell the rally, but he was greeted with a two-run double from Chase Anselment and a three-run home run from Joe Meggs that gave the Huskies an insurmountable 8-1 lead.
With Easter on Sunday, the Trojans traveled to Seattle a day earlier and began their weekend series with Washington on Thursday rather than the traditional Friday.
Junior Andrew Triggs seemed to enjoy the Thursday start. The Trojans’ ace pitched a complete game, allowing only five hits and one run. He also struck out a career-high 10 batters.
“Triggs pitched great on Thursday,” Cruz said. “He really had his sinker going.”
But Triggs’ best play might have come on a ground ball to first in the sixth inning. With the tying run heading to third base, the pitcher became a goalie, dropping down to block a throw in the dirt when he covered first base as USC attempted to turn a double play.
The offense provided all the run support Triggs would need in the second inning when freshman shortstop James Roberts doubled home a pair of runners with two outs.
“The guy that goes unsung is James Roberts,” Cruz said. “He’s been so consistent. He made a big relay throw Saturday and threw another guy out at the plate Friday. He’s hitting .279 and has played great defense. He’s very reliable as a freshman.”
Roberts had hits in all three games to add to his team-leading .400 batting average in conference play.
On Friday, the Trojans put on an offensive display in a 12-9 victory, scoring in the double-digits for only the third time this season.
Junior catcher and leadoff hitter Kevin Roundtree smacked three hits, including his first home run of the season. Roundtree eclipsed his season RBI total with three runs driven in.
Juniors Ricky Oropesa and Matt Foat also had multi-hit, multi-RBI games. Oropesa added his team-leading sixth home run of the season.
Though USC had taken an 11-2 lead, things got close in the late innings when Washington scored seven runs in the seventh. But junior Ben Mount slammed the door, pitching two and one-third perfect innings and striking out three to pick up his second save of the season.
With junior closer Chad Smith out for the season with an elbow injury that will require Tommy John surgery, Mount has stepped up in late game situations.
“He really tried to pick up the slack for Chad Smith being out,” Cruz said. “He worked on his form and has really pitched well the last couple of weeks.”
The Trojans will be back in action Tuesday when they take on Long Beach State at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

For the 16,850 USC fans in attendance, Saturday’s annual spring game at the Coliseum was not pretty, littered with interceptions, incomplete passes and missed field goals.
With senior tailback Marc Tyler and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods sidelined with various ailments, USC’s offense was noticeably out of sync and overwhelmed by a defensive front that has made significant strides in the past year.
But it wasn’t supposed to look like that.
With Trousdale lined with cardinal-clad fans and Traveler trotting around on the sidelines, it was supposed to mirror a fall game, where the Trojans would at least show some cohesiveness.
Instead, it became plainly evident the festivities were taking place in April, not October, based on the number of botched plays, especially on the offensive side of the ball.
Still, for a team severely handicapped by injuries and scholarship restrictions, a perfectly legitimate argument could be made that the team performed admirably considering the hand it was dealt.
In other words, it might be a tad premature to start scaling back expectations for the 2011 Trojans.
Because at certain moments Saturday, albeit brief ones, they looked rather sharp, particularly in regard to the ground game.
On a play mid-way through the first quarter, freshman tailback D.J. Morgan reeled off a 34-yard run, showcasing breathtaking speed that could enable the Taft High standout, who redshirted last season because of a torn ACL, to crack the team’s starting rotation next September.
Minutes later, junior tailback Curtis McNeal, who was academically ineligible last season, put his speed on display as well, finding the endzone on a 49-yard run down the north sidelines.
The tandem combined for 196 yards on 27 carries.
“I just matured,” McNeal said of his newfound success this spring. “I told myself ‘If I want to go to the NFL, I have to change my attitude.’”
Yet the team’s success on the ground was not limited to either back. Sophomore tailback Dillon Baxter, who also received criticism for his immaturity last season, reminded those in attendance why he was such a highly touted prospect coming out of high school with 104 yards on 14 carries, despite recovering from an ankle injury.
“I liked Dillon’s toughness there at the end,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin. “He came back in there pretty banged up.”
And on the last play of the game, Baxter threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Barkley to cap off his afternoon.
Considering the team’s depleted offensive line, their performances were not anything to shrug off, as four of USC’s projected starters for next fall were unavailable Saturday. Sophomore right tackle Kevin Graf and junior center Khaled Holmes missed all of spring practice with injuries, and freshmen guards Cyrus Hobbi and Aundrey Walker have not yet enrolled in school.
Such circumstances might explain some things on the offensive side, particularly with Barkley, who looked uncharacteristically erratic, throwing 42 passes and completing just 20 of them in addition to throwing two interceptions.
“The lack of depth was obvious throughout this whole spring, Barkley said, “but I do believe we made progress.”
Provided you’re scrambling for a few positives, most of the issues Saturday stemmed from injuries. No Woods. No Brandon Carswell. No Rhett Ellison. No Kyle Prater, either.
Barkley, as a result, was forced to throw almost entirely to his cousin, 6-foot Robbie Boyer, and Markeith Ambles, who seemingly spent most of the spring trying to fix his alarm clock.
“It is hard to assess with so many people out all of spring and so many people coming in that are going to have to play for us,” Kiffin said, trying to maintain perspective.
Fortunately, many of the depth issues could be shored up.
With the return of at least 11 players from injury, as well as 24 incoming freshman, according to Kiffin, the Trojans will be afforded at least some depth, and whatever positive glimpses that were seen on Saturday could be magnified.
In short, it boils down to depth. It always has.
It’s no small secret USC lost games last season in the final minutes, against Washington, against Stanford, against Notre Dame. What it has in talent (see: Barkley, Woods, etc.), it lacks it depth.
And if somebody like Woods is out, there aren’t a lot of options behind him — walk-ons mostly.
But come fall at least, those walk-ons turn into highly-touted freshman recruits from across the country — Walker, Hobbi, wide receiver George Farmer and tailback Amir Carlisle, among others.
Reinforcements are coming, in a few months. Yet nonetheless, it remains to be seen, whether any of them will be effective.
 
“The 19th Hole” ran Mondays. To comment on this article e-mail Joey at jrkaufma@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.
Offensively it is all up to the front five on the line. Solid in two places with Holmes and Kalil, while Graf hopefully is ready to step in and contribute well at either tackle or guard. That leaves two spots left to be filled by a freshman, and a squad man who matures over the summer to make a statement he is the one. Depth and quality at the skill positions if they get the room and time to run and pass.

The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team beat No. 8 UCLA in the first round of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation on Saturday 23-25, 25-18, 25-18, 25-21.
With a raucous crowd and a dominant season thus far, the Trojans (21-2, 20-2) had momentum behind them.
Dominant presence · Junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, who was named to the All-MPSF first team, had a match-high 21 kills against UCLA. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
“This is the first playoff match we’ve ever hosted in my time,” said senior setter Riley McKibbin. “It’s awesome to have so much support.”
With the odds stacked against them, the Bruins (16-15, 9-13) switched up their starting lineup, playing the 6-foot-9 Kyle Caldwell at setter, replacing  Alex Scattereggia in an effort to bring in tougher serving and bigger blocking.
After the first set, it seemed to work. UCLA’s defense was rabid, evidenced by its 15 digs in the first set.
“When you’re fighting for your lives in the playoffs, anything can happen,” McKibbin said. “They caught us by surprise.”
Outside hitter Gonzalo Quiroga led the Bruin charge with 15 kills. Caldwell finished with nine kills for the night, most of them from the setter spot.
“They served huge with Caldwell and got us out of system,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “We were guessing what they were going to do lineup-wise so we were a little off.”
USC finished the first set with an atypically low .103 hitting average with seven errors.
Senior opposite Murphy Troy faced a strong double or triple block almost every time he attacked and struggled to unleash his usually dominant attack. He finished with 12 kills earned at a .242 rate.
“Our passing wasn’t as consistent as usual,” Ferguson said. “Murphy [Troy] saw a full block every time.”
Notions of an upset would be quelled, however.
Although the match wasn’t pretty, the Trojans’ cohesion and intensity helped them win the in-betweens, the chaotic plays, and eventually outlast the inconsistent and uncertain Bruins.
“We made too many mistakes in the first set,” Ciarelli said. “In the second, third and fourth set we cleaned it up. That was the key.”
Ciarelli led the match with 21 kills at a .375 rate, channeling his intensity and energy into a quick, powerful and crafty match.
“He’s a big time player and great in big matches,” Ferguson said. “He’s been on fire the last few weeks and doing every thing we need him to do.”
Shandrick led the match with six total blocks while helping to control UCLA’s physical middle blocking duo comprised of Thomas Amberg and Weston Dunlap.
“Those two control their offense,” Shandrick said. “We got some great touches and worked off of that.”
With Saturday’s victory, the Trojans will host UC Irvine in the semifinals next Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
“It’s the first home playoff win for USC in God-knows-how-long,” Ferguson said. “We’re one step closer to our ultimate goal.”
Correction needed about the next match with Irvine which is on Thursday not Saturday of this week, Based on the losses by BYU and Stanford in the 1st round of this tournament USC seems pretty sure of an at large berth at least for the final four at Penn St. the following week.

It was a very relaxed Saturday at the Coliseum, where the Trojans held their annual spring football game, with more than 10 players sidelined with injuries.
Wrong team · Freshman cornerback Anthony Brown picked off a Matt Barkley pass in the first half. It was the first of two picks for Barkley, who completed just 48 percent of his passes. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Without enough players to field two full teams, the scrimmage was held as a battle between the offense and defense. Scoring for the offense was traditional, while the defense was awarded three points for a stop, five for a turnover and seven for a touchdown.
The crowd of 16,850 was treated to a show of defensive domination, which has been the storyline all spring.
Four touchdowns and a field goal were no match for nine stops and three turnovers, and the defense, as a result, cruised to a 42-29 win.
But the biggest newsmakers of the day might have been those who weren’t playing, most notably sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, who injured his ankle playing a game of pickup basketball Friday.
“We now have a no basketball policy the day before the spring game,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin. “But it’s not serious. He warmed up but couldn’t go. And maybe it’s a good thing that it happened really. Because a guy like that, you’d hate for him to get hurt today.”
Woods was unquestionably the offense’s best player this spring, eliciting Kiffin’s praise after nearly every practice, and his absence Saturday was apparent.
“Obviously he would have added a lot more yards to the offense today,” said junior quarterback Matt Barkley. “But you gotta deal with what you have and that’s what we’ve been doing for the last year.”
Woods’ injury did give others a chance to shine, however. Freshman tight end Xavier Grimble had eight catches for 73 yards, and sophomore wide receiver Markeith Ambles had six catches for 76 yards. Sophomore wideout De’Von Flournoy had five catches for 62 yards, and junior wideout Robbie Boyer, Barkley’s cousin, finished with six grabs for 51 yards. Barkley himself finished with the game’s lone receiving touchdown, hauling in a halfback pass from sophomore Dillon Baxter on the game’s final play.
“We practiced that zero,” Barkley said. “We hadn’t gone over that at all. In the huddle Kiff just said, ‘let’s do this.’”
Barkley arguably had more success as a receiver than he did at quarterback. The junior completed just 22 of his 42 passing attempts for 212 yards, and was intercepted twice. Alternating with freshman quarterbacks Jesse Scroggins, Max Wittek and Cody Kessler, Barkley only played every three or four series.
“Obviously a game situation is a lot different where you can get a consistent rhythm,” Barkley said. “You’re trying to put a drive together. So within a drive, that’s where you’re looking for the rhythm. But we’re just trying to get guys reps at this point.”
The defense, however, seemed to be in a rhythm. Freshman cornerback Anthony Brown picked off Scroggins in the endzone, and Barkley was intercepted by junior cornerback Brian Baucham and junior linebacker Dallas Kelley.
Junior defensive end Nick Perry had a pair of sacks, as did senior end Zack Kusnir. Junior safety Jawanza Starling led the team with nine tackles, including a chase-down of Dillon Baxter that prevented a would-be touchdown.
Tackling was the squad’s Achilles heel last year, but appears to be improved this spring.
“Tackling, is a lot of it is heart,” McDonald said. “But you also gotta feel the angles when you’re playing and the speed of the game. We practiced a lot more tackling than we did last spring and it’s paying off for us.”
Beyond tackling, the defense appears dramatically improved from last year to the coaches, despite missing a pair of linemen and all three starting linebackers.
“I think they’re better,” Kiffin said. “[But] I don’t know how good a look we’re really giving them on offense to really challenge them. Hopefully we can give them a better look in the fall.”
Both sides of the ball are looking forward to the fall and the returns of, among others: senior linebackers Shane Horton and Chris Galippo, junior linebacker Devon Kennard, senior defensive tackles Christian Tupou and Armond Armstead, and senior running back Marc Tyler, each of whom missed all or most of the spring.
The injury bug continued to bite Saturday, although none looked serious. Senior wideout Brandon Carswell left with concussion-like symptoms, reshman tailback D.J. Morgan went out with an ankle injury and senior tight end Rhett Ellison didn’t return after being laid out from behind by Starling in the day’s biggest hit. Kiffin said none were serious, however.

USC secured an outright Pac-10 championship Saturday  following a 4-3 win over crosstown rival UCLA — its first road win against the Bruins since 2004.
“They are our biggest rivals,” said freshman Emilio Gomez. “It’s like you have to win. You have to be ready. Winning this here is amazing. I’m so proud of our team.”
After winning the doubles point with victories at the No. 1 and No. 3 spots, things became increasingly difficult for the Trojans (21-2, 6-0).
On the front courts, only junior Steve Johnson was able to walk away with the win, beating Daniel Kosakowski 6-4, 6-1, while junior Daniel Nguyen and senior Jaak Poldma lost, 4-6, 7-6.
After losing his first set, Poldma lost the match for the first time this season in a grueling back-and-forth second set, which he ultimately lost to Amit Inbar.
Playing at No. 6 for the Trojans was senior Peter Lucassen, who won his first set but lost his second and third sets 6-4 and 6-1, eventually falling to UCLA’s Maxime Tabatruong. Freshmen Ray Sarmiento and Gomez were at No. 4 and No. 5, and both lost their first sets.
Sarmiento would make a decisive comeback in his second set, beating Adrien Puget 6-4. Gomez, too, was able to extend the match to three sets against Holden Seguso. “We were down and with Ray we came back,” Gomez said.
Sarmiento ended his match first, winning 2-6, 6-4, 6-2. With two matches remaining, USC led 3-2.
All eyes were on Gomez, who was up 4-3 in the third, but lost a game to the Bruins’ Seguso to even things up 4-4. The crowd went wild, swapping rivalry chants as Gomez secured a 5-4 edge after several grueling deuce points were played. He eventually prevailed 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.
“At the beginning, I was uncomfortable on the court,” Gomez said. “I kept fighting though. At first I was more defensive, and then I attacked.”
Actually, it was USC’s first Pac-10 win against UCLA since 2004. Their last road win at UCLA was last year and before that, their last win at the Los Angeles Tennis Center was in 1991.
Please, at least try to get the facts right. Too many factual errors the last few weeks.

Lenka, the artist who broke into the mainstream a few years back with her hit song “The Show,” is back. Her sophomore album, appropriately titled Two, doesn’t diverge much from the musical style of her first album; She’s still peppy, bubbly and sweet, with enough flair to remain interesting.
Sweet sound · Lenka’s newest album, Two, fails to show any major improvements from her first album and contains mostly cliché songs. - Photo courtesy of Big Hassle 
Two is a very middle-of-the-road album. It’s not bad and it’s not great enough to receive any particular recognition. It’s a step above being a conglomeration of sugary-sweet nothings. The album is nothing to get excited about, but there are a handful of songs worth purchasing.
One of those is the catchy opening track “Two,” which is easily the liveliest and one of the strongest songs. It’s a melody-and-drums driven song and has a great beat that will have listeners at least bopping their heads along, if not dancing.
“Two” is followed by “Heart Skips A Beat,” the album’s first single. Though not as catchy, “Heart Skips A Beat” is a decent, sweet song which features more electro-beats. Ultimately, though, the track is nothing too special.
It leads into “Roll With The Punches,” a smooth, upbeat song about shaking off whatever life throws your way, which arguably would have been a better first single than “Heart Skips A Beat.”
“Roll With The Punches” is Lenka’s new “The Show.” Although “The Show” featured more piano, the music styles and overall messages are similar. The track will take Lenka fans back a few years, while offering new listeners a simple, enjoyable song.
The first bump in the album is reached as soon as “Everything At Once” starts to play. The instrumentals during the verse sound similar to something you would hear at a cliché carnival and the melody is repetitive and underdeveloped.
Coupled with the melody, the lyrics are surprisingly childish and distractingly silly, especially with lines like As sly as a fox, as strong as an ox / as fast as a hare, as brave as a bear. It’s a song destined to be skipped over.
“Everything’s Okay,” which sounds similar to Marit Larsen’s “If A Song Could Get Me You,” rises above the flavorlessness of the other slow songs on the album.
The transition from the verse to the chorus is similar to skies clearing after a storm; the track starts off somber but breaks into something a little more cheery in the chorus without losing the easygoing pace.
Most of the others songs blend together. Aside from “Everything At Once,” none of the songs are downright bad, but there’s nothing particularly engaging about them.
Two seems to be even with Lenka’s first album in terms of quality, which means the artist is either playing it safe or simply hasn’t grown much as a musician.
Although Two is a little punchier and more energized than her previous album, it would have benefited from more brass instruments to add some pizzazz to her sound.
As for the lyrics, Lenka fans and casual listeners waiting to hear something different might be disappointed. Lenka isn’t completely generic, but her lyrics don’t stray far from what listeners would expect from cutesy love songs.
For example, in “Heart Skips A Beat,” the first verse starts out with My heart is playing tricks on me / And it’s building bricks on me, which sounds intriguing, but then it ends with I can’t break through / And I can’t face you, which falls into the generic trap. Was anyone expecting that last line to end in anything except “you?”
Lenka walks a very fine line of wanting to be straight-forward yet poetic.
It’s easy to tell she means well with her words, but it would be nice for her to become a bit more unique and masterful with them.
Lenka has her own personal charm, which helps her craft her music, making it difficult to dislike her. When it comes down to it, Lenka’s music is like candy; it’s sweet and fun, but ultimately leaves something to be desired.

On Friday, April 22, The Railroad Revival Tour made its second stop at an old shipping yard in San Pedro. In a mere six days, Old Crow Medicine Show, Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros and the revelatory Mumford and Sons, will have trekked from Oakland to New Orleans, with stops in both Arizona and Texas. The tour itself, which invokes Woody Guthrie and Jack Kerouac in its pursuit of anachronistic Americana, moves by way of 15 vintage railcars, and will have covered 2,000 miles by journey’s end.
According to Railroad Revival Tour’s official press release, “Today’s mass transit is built for speed and volume, which suits our modern lifestyle. But sometimes the notion of landscape and discovery is left behind.”
Given the nostalgic and unique nature of the tour, the outdoor location at San Pedro was within walking distance to the train tracks, allowing the performers to gesture to their steel sweetheart for added poignancy during the show. Food trucks, billowing with smoke, pulled up along the water, sending smells of simmering shrimp across the yard, while sailors watched for free from the docks. Even cops armed to the teeth and angry couldn’t disrupt the event’s surreal and communal atmosphere. That day, the sun seemed to set a little later, as if to forestall the imposition of the 10 p.m. curfew.
Although doomed to impart to only a fraction of the crowd that would arrive later on in the evening, the opening act, Old Crow Medicine Show, charmed the audience with an endearing set of buoyant bluegrass and alternative-country tunes. The band’s most popular numbers, “Wagon Wheel,” and “Tell It To Me,” however, were merely top notes in a set of brilliant instrumental outbursts and collaborative efforts with those they call “The Mumford Boys.” Interestingly, “The Mumford Boys” would prove an apt title for the English folk rockers, who struggled to keep up with Old Crow Medicine Show’s lead singer and consummate fiddler, Ketch Secor, during a tandem effort. What this serves to say is that Ketch and his seasoned confederates are an incredibly underrated band, but also that Mumford and Sons is still a very young one. During the final set of the evening, Marcus Mumford, lead singer and guitarist of Mumford and Sons, made a point of saying that he was humbled to share the stage with the other bands. As he continues to collaborate with such talented veterans, one can only imagine how prolific and exciting Mumford’s maturation will be.
After Old Crow Medicine Show cooed and cawed for an hour with the energy of a thousand American rebels, then came the cosmic yodeling of Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros. After a sloppy entry with a reverb-heavy version of “Desert Song,” leader singer Alex Ebert struggled to capture the hypnotic quality of many of the group’s recognizable numbers. Ebert appeared flustered throughout, and in turn, the familial mojo of his band was severely thrown off. The ad hoc style of their set, which included vexing discussions amongst the band members between songs in order to decide what they would play next, also significantly detracted from the experience and decimated the linearity that Mumford and Sons was fortunately able to maintain during its set. Despite the undeniable energy of  “40 Day Dream,”  “Janglin” and “Om Nashi Me,” Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros lulled the standing crowd into restlessness.
Mumford and Sons, clearly the most widely understood of the trio, was met with a roar of applause as soon as the lights dimmed over San Pedro. Combining the novelty of some terrific new tracks such as “Lover’s Eyes” and “Lover of The Light,” with the guttural and glorified passion of their album Sigh No More, Mumford and Sons commanded the stage with unearthly presence.
Unlike most young bands of today, Mumford and Sons truly does have enough music to fill an hour. Marcus Mumford’s voice, both raw and haunting, makes the music vulnerable and beautifully imperfect. And from the eerie stillness of the first verses to the electricity of each song’s characteristic breakdown, Mumford and Sons refuses to be contained.
Despite some technical complications and a few underwhelming numbers, The Railroad Revival Tour is still very much worth seeing. If nothing else, the tour proves one thing: Music is alive and well, and people, young and old, drunk and sober, will stay standing for five hours just to be a part of that glory.

The name Paul Simon isn’t, for whatever reason, prominent these days. It’s strange, considering Paul Simon has been at the forefront of America’s music scene in past generations.
Simon says · Paul Simon’s most recent solo album, So Beautiful or So What, has thought-provoking lines and complex instrumentals that make it successful. - Photo courtesy of Allison Elbl 
After all, he is the Simon of Simon and Garfunkel, the duo that redefined folk music in the  ’60s. And he’s the Simon who trailblazed a solo career featuring gems like 1986’s Graceland. But Simon has not been a genuine musical force in the past decade.
As his new album So Beautiful or So What shows, however, Simon still has the talent to make a deceptively creative album, full of wit and humor.
It’s not necessarily an easy album to access. In today’s universe of melody sampling, it seems just plain weird to hear the sort of thing Simon offers: So Beautiful or So What is an eccentric blend of folk-rock twinged with a country twang and delicate, ethereal sounds of acoustic strings. This is all glued together with world influences, such as tabla percussion, and occasionally punctuated with space-age sound effects.
It’s a bit strange sounding at times, as if an indie folk band ate marijuana brownies and decided to hang out in Mumbai at a bluegrass concert. And because of this, it’s easy to dismiss the album as disheveled madness.
Take the album opener, “Getting Ready for Christmas Day,” a track with swooping keyboard notes, hand claps, a sermon sample and a guitar track panning from left to right to left like a jumping flea. It’s enough to make the average music fan go running for more Bruno Mars.
But here’s the secret: Simon has always been good at this sort of musical alchemy. He’s done it in past albums, and like some sort of magic, the songs of So Beautiful or So What grow on you with time.
The album isn’t perfect, but given the chance, it charms beyond words.
Compositions aside, it sure helps that Simon is, and has always been, a lyrical genius. The album’s themes of love, life and God show through throughout as Simon repeatedly poses questions in different forms.
It’s the kind of existential soliloquizing that can, without skill and subtlety, make you want to tear your hair out.
Thankfully, Simon has skill and subtlety. His writing avoids the deathtraps of pretentious babble, ringing truthful and heartfelt instead, with wit and humor to match.
You got to fill out a form first, and then you wait in the line, Simon offers in “The Afterlife,” as he wonders about the process of getting to heaven.
But Simon is not all winks and chuckles.
In fact, So Beautiful or So What’s best lies in its moments of quiet, reflective thought.
Simon somehow can make a song feel like a 300-page novel at times, like with the majestic and relentlessly bittersweet ballad “Love and Hard Times.”
The tears burned, the windows rattled, the locks turned, Simon sings, continuing with the poignant lines It’s easy to be generous when you’re owed / it’s hard to be grateful when you’re out of control.
The music is complex and epic enough to match: Melodies wander, keys shift, new instruments and sounds fall in at will and climaxes and resolutions shapeshift without warning.
For these reasons, So Beautiful or So What can be at once a supremely satisfying but also an unnervingly frustrating album to listen to.
Depending on your mood, it might all make sense. Minutes later, it might seem outright stupid.
But at the very least, there is no doubt Simon’s work is thoughtful and provocative, both musically and lyrically. In it’s sheer uniqueness, So Beautiful or So What stands out as a must-listen for anyone willing to honestly call themselves passionate about music.
Simon has somehow created a work of fearless originality in a time when originality is so scarce.
Now it’s just a matter of finding people to sit and hear it for themselves.

A growing number of USC undergraduates come from outside of Southern California. To catch up on units or to ease the course load during the school year, many students opt for summer school.
Cindy Lee | Daily Trojan
Many of those students, however, prefer not to stay in Los Angeles to attend USC summer classes, but getting USC to accept credit for classes taken elsewhere can sometimes be difficult.
Online classes appear to be the solution to this impasse.
Online classes have already been shown to be successful at USC.
Since USC’s online Master of Arts in Teaching program, MAT@USC, was created two years ago, the program has expanded ten-fold to enroll more than 1,500 current and aspiring teachers, according to a USC press release.
Through the program offered by the Rossier School of Education, online students have the same graduation requirements and identical coursework as students on campus. The program is fully accredited, and online students enjoy the same benefits as any other Trojan. The only difference between online and on-campus is location.
Given the success of offering entire master’s degrees online, it seems entirely feasible to offer more online courses for undergraduates — particularly during the summer.
Online classes still have the stigma of being “less rigorous” than on-campus courses, but that perception fades with research. Online courses demand the same amount of time, effort and commitment. The only difference is students and professors do not all have to be physically present in the same location.
Opponents have argued online courses can limit interactions between students or between the student and the professor, harming the learning experience.
Currently, courses in the online master’s degrees are interactive, featuring weekly or biweekly video classroom lectures or discussions that resemble a real-time Skype session with several students and a professor.
Students also use discussion forums and blogs to stay connected and to form an interactive community. Occasionally, students might even upload videos of their assignments, like shadowing a teacher in an elementary school.
Professors and students participate in online discussions and, with the help of interactive technology, can have real-time interactions.
For online courses, professors still have “office hours,” but it involves signing on to a video chat session during certain times of the week, instead visiting an actual office.
And students can literally take the classroom with them with the MAT@USC iPhone and iPad apps, which allow them to chat with classmates about the next exam. During scheduled class time, they “press a button to virtually raise their hand,” according to  MAT@USC.
Though certain courses, such as chemistry with its laboratory experiments and biology with its dissections, might not be entirely feasible as all-online classes, many general education requirements or introductory courses could be transformed into online summer options for students seeking to explore another field of study or rack up some credits for their current major.
According to the 2010 Sloan Survey of Online Learning, more than 5.6 million students nationwide were enrolled in one or more online courses, and the number is increasing exponentially.
Online education has proven to be a viable and effective teaching method with graduate education and should be seriously considered at the undergraduate level for students seeking summer classes.

Republican or Democrat, capitalist or socialist, one would be hard-pressed to find an American who does not see the need to reduce our deep federal debt.
But political infighting and a general disagreement about the government’s fiscal responsibilities among legislators has prevented any truly decisive action from being taken to fix the situation.
This conditioned apathy to legitimate action by our government shows how disconnected the citizenry has become from its own government, an issue that is a result of  a gross deviation from the mission the Founding Fathers outlined.
Just an hour before a partial government shutdown was to go into effect, Congress passed a deal to cut $38.5 billion in spending while also allowing funding for the government through September 30. The budget passed the House with a 260-167 vote and the Senate 81-19, and could not have passed without bipartisan support.
But the deal is essentially just a stopgap measure; the budget will be an important issue for voters to pay attention to over the next few months.
The government has continuously tacked more expenditures onto the federal budget, providing benefits for many people but also leading to an ever-increasing national debt and serious economic woes.
Though expenditures on things like public education and social programs might seem necessary, they are often superfluous for the protection of the life, liberty and property of citizens.
We have become dependent on a government that has conditioned us to expect certain entitlements, a dependence that has essentially continued to steep us in debt and economic turmoil.
By cutting every dime of spending not absolutely necessary for the protection of the life, liberty and property of citizens, the government would essentially nip in the bud a repeat of our recent economic problems and allow the people to return to the more independent lifestyle our founders intended for us in the first place.
One cut that hits close to home for many USC students is the decrease in money given in Pell grants. This cut could force an adjustment in how students pay for college, and shows a return to a more economical government will not be easy.
People will have to adapt to changes in government spending that could cut their entitlements, but at the same time, the government will be allowed to do its job of protecting its citizens, without putting its hand in every aspect of our lives.
Such a massive limitation of government powers, while not desired by some people, is the only path that can return our nation to prosperity and prevent a further deterioration of our national and personal finances.
If we ignore this, we will only continue to suffer more and more at the hands of an overly partisan, ineffective government.
This idea will only increase in importance as we approach the 2012 presidential elections. Hopefully students will keep this in mind as the political campaigns continue to heat up this summer.
Candidates will propose their own preferences as to what spending cuts to make. But as the generation that will inherit these budget challenges, the more informed we are on these issues now, the better.

interesting article, much of the spendings could be cut if the government were to imply a simple clean up at its own doorstep. How many members of congress have a rapsheet ? A convicted felon loses his/her right to vote unless he/she votes in the house or the senate. They get a great healthcare package you and me will never see in our lifetime since THEY will fight healthcare reforms for the drug companies who finance their campaigns.
Another point, a large numbers of people in this country live off the others simply because they know the system better than the rest of us, we spend billions on redneck whitetrash who claim disability because they fried their brains with speed, crack, dust…..(fill in with any substance you see fit). And they keep reproducing like wildfire, watch “idiocracy”  for an amusing gander at america’s future.
The japanese were put in interment camps rather quickly after pearl harbor, why can’t we erect a few stakes and a little barbwire  around most trailer parks in the nation ? Could be a bonding experience for the produtive americans who are fed the #$%$# up with these inbred leeches biting the hand that feeds them. A quick trip in the south or midwest will make you see that they hate “dem caleeforneeeea leebrolz” while existing solely from the federal taxes collected in our beautiful state.
Whirligig is right. Snipe them off. We can then pawn their gunracked pick up trucks and country records and rebuild the economy.
Getting off the fractional monetary system should be addressed too.
This is racist, sad, and obviously written by a person even more ignorant than the people he or she is condemning. Interestingly, the states of the Midwest have far lower unemployment than the nation as whole, and – gasp – CALIFORNIA. North Dakota’s unemployment rate hasn’t gone over 5% since the eighties and if you were to look at the nations lowest poverty rates, you’d find many of the Midwestern states  right at the top. Chicago and Minneapolis/St. Paul are among this nation’s most cosmopolitan cities, as evidenced by Minneapolis’ longstanding status as America’s most literate city.
Get your racist ass off the couch and actually know something about the place you’re slandering.
I believe that if we the people snipe all the gang bangers, drug dealers & child molestors, it would cause a huge relief to our economic situation! With them all dead & gone there would be no need for hundreds of social, educational or medical care programs. Just imagine the trickle down effect that would happen! And if we all went back to the basics of individual human resposibility like: don’t litter, don’t waste water ( do we really need front lawns, just to look at) don’t steal, don’t keep eating until you become obese, don’t abuse animals, the elderly, children or the disabled.  Additionally, if we require all politicians to take a lie detector & drug test once a week I do believe we could make a nice size dent into our debt!
P.S. does our government & military really need to stick their nose’s into every other country’s buisness?
Great article!  Most college students, let alone the average American does not considers the economic peril our crushing national debt and ever-expanding government programs put all of us at.  There was a good article in the April 25th issue of TIME Magazine discussing how we subsidize the socialized healthcare of European nations by providing military service for them….at an ENORMOUS cost to us!  Check it out.
Please, define “essential”. Nothing is essential to LIFE, but plenty of things are essential spending if we want to live in a civilized society. Sure, let’s go back to the level of government in the 18th Century, and see how you like it. Life expectancy of 40 (no health insurance) almost universal poverty (no social security) widespread illiteracy (no public education), and a generally-horrendous quality of life. Your idea is simplistic and ridiculous.
Much federal spending is “nice to have,” not “essential for the survival of the nation.” Congress should focus the federal government on a few items mentioned in the US Constitution, and do them well, before restarting the “nice to have,” parts of the federal government again.
One quick start would be to give away all the federal lands that occur within state boundaries. It takes large amounts of federal efforts to manage resources inside other jurisdictions. All those federal employees could then work for the states and have their contracts renegotiated to what is affordable by the local jurisdictions.

Down to Funk officially released its EP, RU?, this past Friday night at USC’s hippest music venue, Tommy’s Place. With a merch table stacked with CDs, DTF was ready to celebrate with old fans, new fans and the opening acts, Segun and House Fire.
House Fire started the night off right with a solid, yet laid-back feel. Although the band’s sound wasn’t quite in the funk genre, the band did not disappoint the crowd.
Aman Alem, the lead singer majoring in music performance, jokingly said to the crowd that everyone was probably wondering why they were even there.
The band members performed at ease and judging by the genuine smiles on their faces looked like they were having some great moments on stage. The music flowed in an organic and natural way, similar to something that would be heard at a summer night’s beach party.
Each member stood out in some way throughout the set, whether it be Alem’s soulful voice or a solid bass groove. After the group’s set came to a close, an audience member walked up to the stage to talk to the drummer and walked back saying “I just touched a superhero.”
Kicking it up a notch in the funk department, Segun, wearing a classic bright red top hat and suspenders with an all white slacks and dress shirt, commanded the attention of the audience.
Segun without a doubt has the characteristics of an entertaining and dedicated performer. No matter what he sang, from Aretha Franklin’s energetic “Think” to his original ballad “Hero,” he put his heart and soul into his performance. Switching the instrumentation up a bit with an acoustic guitar in “Hero” was a nice touch to the emotional song.
His voice has a very smooth tone that allows him to hit the sweet spots of a range of notes with little to no struggle.
Segun had the spirit of James Brown’s old-school charm during his cover of Janelle Monáe’s “Tightrope.” Encouraging the audience to dance it up as his band jammed, he whirled around the stage with swift footwork. Even when his mic stand started to fall towards the floor, he swung near it and caught it as if it was a part of the dance.

After a long wait, Down to Funk finally graced the stage with a mission to “funkify your life and move your feet,” according to DTF’s Facebook music page.
Luckily, by the time they began to funk everyone up, Tommy’s began to fill up with people eager to dance.
Playing both new and old jams, there was always a constant drive within the songs that powered ahead, even during solos. From a dynamic horn section, to a keyboardist flying his hands over the keys, to a beastly drummer in a pair of flip flops, the skill level of the night was at an all-time high. It isn’t every day a bass player, like DTF’s Thor, is seen slapping away on what looked like a five-string bass. The only complaint would be the guitarist being a tad overpowering in volume, but his technique made up for it.
The soulful lead singer, Lara Johnson, may be small in stature and size but she has some powerful pipes to belt it out.
She did a great job at working the stage and making a connection with the crowd. Walking and jumping around the stage in high heels would make most women cringe at the thought, but Johnson looked like she was as comfortable as if they were a pair of old sneakers.
DTF promised the crowd a surprise and they definitely lived up to it. During their rendition of Curtis Mayfield’s “Move On Up,” Harry Mack, a freestyle rapper, joined the band on stage with a warm welcome from the crowd and spit out a couple verses.
The beauty of Mack’s delivery was that he incorporated his surroundings, such as specific members of the audience, people playing pool or the atmosphere of Tommy’s Place.
Ending the show by bringing out saxophonist Justin Klunk and vocalists Jordan Pharoah, Alem and Segun was a great choice for “I Wish” by Stevie Wonder. It left people pleased, yet wanting to hear more. Until their next performance, fans will have to satisfy their craving for funk by purchasing and listening to the DTF’s EP.

The University of Kansas men’s basketball team released its 2011 non-conference schedule, and USC fans will want to make sure they circle Dec. 22 on their calendars.
USC will play the perennial powerhouse on that date — the fourth time the teams face each other since 2006. The home game for the Trojans will be played at the Galen Center.
After last year’s game in Lawrence, Kansas, it seemed logical that this year’s would be in Los Angeles, but that apparently was not always the plan.
Kansa coach Bill Self said on March 29 USC had requested to change the venue from Los Angeles to the Intrust Arena in Wichita, Kansas. This would have been a definitive sellout and would have almost certainly been dominated by Jayhawk fans. All the gate proceeds, however, would have gone to USC.
The two teams signed a home-and-home agreement last year. Since Kansas was the home team in last year’s game, USC would have been considered the home team in this year’s match-up regardless of the venue.
Last December, the Trojans and Jayhawks faced off at Allen Fieldhouse. Despite being on the road and Kansas being heavily favored, USC nearly pulled off the upset, eventually losing 70-68.
Kansas has the edge overall against USC, boasting a 9-5 record in the all-time series.

With summer just around the corner, it’s hard not to feel the urge to binge on some of our favorite treats in bouts of celebratory bliss.
But although summer might be fun and carefree, the season also preys on our laid-back attitudes by challenging our dedication to healthy diets with daringly delicious distractions.
The temptations are almost everywhere, from chips and desserts at barbeques to gooey S’mores at late-night beach parties.
In other words, summer is capable of eliminating any signs of your beach body in just a matter of months.
So when it comes to staying focused, what are some healthy alternatives to classic summer snacks?
Take a look at the food pyramid and you’ll find that fruits are your best friends when it comes to providing vitamins, fiber and the tools to staying fit.
Many fruits are in season during the summer months. And with warmer weather on the way, fruits carry naturally high amounts of water to quench that ever-growing thirst.
As snacks, fruits are wonderful at satiating appetites and impressing partygoers with their versatility and taste.
The numerous options will fit practically anybody’s tastes. If you’re heading to a party, try cutting a handful of fruits into bite-sized pieces to create a colorful platter of irresistible morsels. Popular choices often include watermelon and pineapple.
Feeling a bit more creative than that? Construct fruit kebabs. Fruit kebabs are both exciting to make and convenient for wandering guests. You can combine whatever fruits you like in whatever ways you like.
Fruit kebabs are especially fun if you have a theme to follow or want to cut pieces into specific shapes.
But sometimes plain fruit just doesn’t cut it. Is there a similarly healthy equivalent to munching on the real thing?
The answer is yes: It’s time to hit up your blender and start cranking out smoothies.
Smoothies are some of the healthiest snacks you can make post-workout. Not only are they delicious and filling, but they are also easy to make.
Berries are at their ripest in the summer and will provide you with special antioxidants and fibers  known to reduce the risk of common illnesses like cancers.
When creating smoothies, stick to nonfat milk and generally sweeter fruits, so you won’t feel the need to add any excess sugar to your concoctions.
Although smoothies are classic fruity drinks, what about lemonade? Where does the nostalgic drink rank in terms of healthiness?
Most of us can recall a time in our lives when selling lemonade was an indicator of our abilities to run a major business. But in reality, lemonade isn’t exactly the way to go if you’re looking to stay healthy for the summer.
If it’s just one of those can’t-do-withouts, try changing it up by substituting sugar with another sweetener like honey. The drink will be a variation on what you’re used to, but will still taste delicious.
And when the day nears its end, the fight against unhealthy snacks continues, and the sweet tooth comes out to play.
You don’t have to compromise your health to sneak a bite of chocolatey heaven. Fruit can do wonders to desserts and still keep them tasting as sweet and decadent as ever.
If you’re in the mood for ice cream, try mixing some fruit directly into your bowl. You can even freeze the fruit ahead of time to keep the temperature consistent throughout.
Chocolate lovers, on the other hand, can take the dipped-fruit route. As long as you don’t overdo the chocolate layers and opt for dark chocolate whenever possible, these midnight snacks will be relatively healthy.
Prefer popsicles? Try making your own frozen fruit sticks by pouring 100 percent fruit juice into ice cube trays and placing them in the freezer with toothpicks or clean popsicle sticks in the centers of the molds.
Summer is almost here, but it doesn’t really matter how you choose to incorporate fruits into your daily eating schedules. As long as you make an effort to continue eating healthily, you’ll feel better about yourself and be able to enjoy your summer guilt-free.

Lindsay Lohan has had nothing short of trouble this year.  From being the subject of countless tabloids to being a regular at the courthouse, she is definitely no longer the cute twelve-year-old from The Parent Trap. 
The Mean Girls actress was reportedly released after spending five hours in custody out of a 120 day sentence, posting a $75,000 bail Friday night in Los Angeles. Although Lohan had been charged with violating probation and stealing a pricey necklace ($2,500) from a boutique in Venice, Calif., on Friday her sentence was lessedn to only a misdemeanor.
Besides 120 days in prison, her sentence included 500 hours of community service, 300 of which will be at a women’s shelter and a county morgue.
But Lohan’s future is not all pin striped suits and bars.  Entertainment Weekly reported that the celebrity will be playing the wife of the currently imprisoned mobster “Junior” Gotti in the film Gotti: Three Generations.
The film’s cast includes John Travolta as her father-in-law Gotti Sr. and Joe Pesci as Angelo Ruggierio. Maybe the countless hours Lohan spent in court will help her get into character
On a serious note, here’s hoping these are the last of Lohan’s legal troubles.

A throng of students crowded into Tommy’s Place on Saturday night to watch Bonnie Dune perform, many of whom likely showed up to see Glee’s Cory Monteith on percussion. As the lights dimmed, Bonnie Dune’s band members entered to raucous applause, with Monteith sneaking into his seat with a gleeful grin. Justin Wilczynski played lead vocals with Seth Roberts on rhythm guitar and Josh Kerr on bass.
To the disappointment of a few spectators, (not least of which your DT reporters), Monteith did not sing lead in any of the songs. Instead, he pointed and spoke to the crowd from his seat, blowing the occasional kiss to the lucky few in the front.
The band opened with “Seasick,” a selection from its EP released in 2008, a year before Glee premiered. The crowd danced, screamed proclamations of love and hoisted phones to snap photos of the celebrity hiding behind the drum set.

Bonnie Dune’s band members seemed nonplussed by the enthusiasm. Wilczynski mentioned several times throughout the night what a great crowd it was, perhaps the “best” of the tour. Monteith, however, took the excessive screams without missing a beat.
After Bonnie Dune played its final song and left the stage, the audience didn’t quite seem to believe the set was over, as it waited expectantly and silently for the band members to reappear. After a minute, chants of “encore” began, and the four of them emerged buoyantly. Wilczynski told the crowd that the band would be repeating a song played earlier in the set, “Sailboat,” and invited anyone who knew the lyrics to join the group onstage.
Dozens of concertgoers — mostly girls — swarmed the stage, many queuing to hug Monteith, which prompted Wilczynski to say, “Face the audience, OK?” (Monteith was allegedly beamed by a mic accidentally in one overenthusiastic hug.)
And then the band began its song, with the adoring fans chiming in gamely on every non-specific “ooo” in the chorus. Band members looked jubilant, if a little wary of their 20-strong backup singers, and ended the set on a high note.
“Such a good time at USC! We called everyone up on stage at the end and had a party wooooooo,” Monteith tweeted shortly after the show.
