Within the dimly lit confines of Sunset Boulevard’s House of Blues, a melting pot of fans — ranging from tattoo-covered rockers to gaudy, middle-aged mothers — gathered to hear the night’s lineup of Civil Twilight, Crash Kings and Anberlin. Faint blue lights cast a veil of soon-to-be-broken serenity over the awaiting motley crew.
The stage was only faintly visible, partially masked behind a projection screen. After microphone tests were over, the crowd became placated and the projection screen rose to reveal Civil Twilight, the night’s first band — coming to Los Angeles all the way from South Africa.
Civil Twilight’s lead singer Steven McKellar captured the audience’s attention by taking center stage with his sleek, all-black bass guitar. As McKellar began to sing, he further captivated the audience with trembling spurts of falsetto.
The concert was held to raise money for the charity Faceless International, which funds construction of homes in Haiti and Hawaii. These new homes will give basic security and protection to local children from human trafficking and child prostitution. As Civil Twilight got into its set, it became clear that the show would be an all-out rock concert, not just a charity event.
After the band’s opening song, McKellar’s stage character began to develop: He knelt down on the floor of the stage and beckoned to the crowd with his hands, as if to playfully taunt them. The crowd loved it, and as soon as McKellar was back on his feet, he began to rock and jive like Elvis Presley.
The blue and pink lights from the stage mixed with guitarist Andrew McKellar’s delay effect produced a dreamlike aura. This phantsmagora was accentuated by an extended jam session that showed off all three members of Civil Twilight: the McKellar brothers slapped the bass and shredded the guitar while Richard Wouters pulverized the drums.
Civil Twilight soothed the frenetic aftershock of its jam session by playing a smooth love song. Steven McKellar switched from bass guitar to keyboard as a lone spotlight drifted over him; layer upon layer of serene sound lay on the pit as the sounds of the keyboard softened the crowd.
The lights on the stage disappeared dramatically as the ballad ended. Next, Civil Twilight engaged the audience in a sanguine song highlighted by waves of feedback and soulful howls courtesy of Steven McKellar.
Civil Twilight concluded its set on an endearing note, telling the audience to say hello after the concert — the band members would later be in the pit. Their final song incorporated a barrage of drumbeats and piano chords that depicted the epic scene of a building being musically demolished.
Crash Kings took the stage in a way that lived up to the band’s name: Dissonant piano chords resounded throughout the venue accompanied by aggressive drumbeats. Lead vocalist Tony Beliveau sang with a sharp, caustic tone and smacked the keys on his piano in between songs.
The most interesting part of Crash Kings’ set was realizing that they had no lead guitarist. In place of a guitar, Tony Beliveau successfully used a piano keyboard with delay effects and an oversize whammy bar to elicit virtuosic “guitar” solos. The best instrumental solos during Crash Kings’ set were in fact on Beliveau’s electronic keyboard.
Crash Kings generously pumped the audience up for headliner Anberlin. Beliveau got audience members screaming at the top of their lungs — otherwise, he said, Anberlin might not come out.
Anberlin opened with a tempest of dark, pulsating sound waves ushered by the synchronized beating of two drums. Behind the stage, white lights panned slowly down a pitch-black backdrop.
When the headliner performed its older hit “Paperthin Hymn,” the crowd at House of Blues screamed the lyrics as an ecstatic mob, drowning out lead singer Stephen Christian. The crowd’s enthusiasm pleased the group and Christian profusely thanked the crowd.
Anberlin’s set was a balanced blend of old and new songs. Christian dedicated the old songs to the faithful fans that had stuck with the band since its beginning.
When the group played “Dismantle.Repair.,” from its album Cities, Christian’s voice was trumped by robust instrumentals; it sounded as if he was faintly whispering to the crowd, and the residue of his voice echoed silently when there was a pause in the music. When Christian’s voice could be heard, he discharged throat-busting vitriol that gave his vocals an air of vehemence.
The most interesting part of Anberlin’s set was when an unidentified guest singer accompanied Christian on Anberlin’s new hit, “Pray Tell.” The dual vocals added unique harmonic layers to the song — and mystique because nobody knew who the guest singer was.
Throughout the set, the light show onstage matched the melodic and harmonic movements of the instruments. During the song “Impossible,” the guitar part had a nautical delay effect that gave the song the feeling of swimming underwater. Appropriately, the lights onstage were various shades of blue and white and streamed across like waves — accompanied by crowd surfers.
Anberlin adequately concluded the night’s show with its song “Fin” as the encore, which was highlighted by an angelic sounding choir chanting the chorus. Anberlin departed, leaving the audience in a chaotic whirlpool of static feedback.

After going on tour to promote its new album Hands All Over, which was released in September, Los Angeles native Maroon 5 returned this weekend to play an outstanding show at Griffith Park’s Greek Theatre.
The band’s first opening act was the largely undiscovered Ry Cuming, a singer-songwriter from Australia who just released his self-titled debut in July. The audience wasn’t very familiar with his work, but he was well received after his short set.
His sound had traces of Sara Bareilles and Dashboard Confessional as well as Maroon 5, but it also had a lighter, less sexual and more acoustic-driven songs than Maroon 5’s. Ry Cuming wasn’t fantastic, but he provided a nice foreshadowing for the main attraction.
OneRepublic took the stage next, opening with the song “Everybody Loves Me” from its new album Waking Up. It had a long set for an opening band and played too many songs from its new album, but it got the audience on its feet, finally pumping some liveliness into the crowd.
The band, of course, played the songs everyone was familiar with: “All the Right Moves,” “Stop and Stare,” “Apologize” and new single “Secrets.” However, its new music, including “Good Life” and “Marchin On,” possessed an upbeat and powerful energy that wasn’t present in its older songs and added to the band’s concert appeal.
Front man Ryan Tedder was fun and engaging and understandably so — his songs are about the greatness of life. Also worthy of recognition was Brent Kutzle’s beautiful cello playing, which added a layer of intricacy to the music.
As one of the last — and by far most entertaining — parts of its set, OneRepublic did a mashup of Ben E. King’s classic “Stand By Me” and the White Stripes’ “Seven Nation Army” where Tedder eventually sang the chorus of Justin Timberlake’s “SexyBack” over the bridge of “Seven Nation Army.”
By then, the atmosphere was buzzing and the audience was more than ready for Maroon 5. After a drawn-out buildup, Maroon 5 finally hit the stage and started off with a bang, playing a bass-heavy, beat-driven version of “Misery,” the first single off Hands All Over.
Then the band played “If I Never See Your Face Again” and “Harder to Breathe,” which progressed into a guitar battle between lead guitarist James Valentine and vocalist Adam Levine. People who have only heard Maroon 5 on the radio would have been pleasantly surprised — or even shocked — by how much skilled guitar work was incorporated into the show.
The band’s set list was versatile; Maroon 5 played a decent number of songs off its new album as well as a few from It Won’t Be Soon Before Long. Not surprisingly, Songs About Jane was the bread and butter of the show. Although not the band’s first album, Songs About Jane was the album that put Maroon 5 on the map and to which the crowd was most receptive.
The band was animated, and charismatic front man Levine put a lot of effort into engaging the audience by running back and forth on stage, jumping (and occasionally falling), doing call and response and dedicating a significant amount of time to shredding on his guitar. There was also a lot of camaraderie between the band members.
Even if many audience members were really only interested in singing along to the handful of recognizable Billboard hits, the band did not slack off with any of its songs. The music mellowed out in the middle and many people sat down for songs such as “Secret,” the impossibly catchy “Won’t Go Home Without You” and fan favorite “She Will Be Loved.” But the crowd popped right back up as the band played the new, upbeat and top 40-ready “Stutter.” Maroon 5 ended with another old favorite, “This Love,” putting the most passion into the last number.
Maroon 5’s set felt a bit short, so the audience members were especially pleased when the band came back out for an encore with funk-infused “Makes Me Wonder” and “Sunday Morning” beneath a giant disco ball. Maroon 5 ended appropriately with “Sweetest Goodbye,” a slow song from Songs About Jane that Levine admitted was one of the very few, if not the only, “nice” songs on the album.
With a medley of its bluesy, funk-influenced pop rock hits, Maroon 5 entertained and engaged the audience, rewarding in particular its more dedicated fans. Levine’s swaggering on stage persona and vocal range further fueled the band’s delivery. Along with its fitting opening acts, Maroon 5 had a second successful night at the Greek Theatre.

There is a high probability that you are one of the 1.7 million listeners each week tuning in to WBEZ Chicago’s This American Life.
Photo by Daniel Wang
In that case, you’ll recognize Ira Glass’ voice — its bookish, dry sound, comforting and soothing in its unremarkability.
Maybe you listen to him while you’re driving back home from a long day of classes or while you’re running in the morning with the iPod earbuds in your ears. In a time where most kids grow up to iTunes rather than their mother’s bedtime stories, Glass is an iconic figure — except you only know him by his voice.
But on Monday evening, students again had the chance to put a face to that famous voice, as Glass returned to USC after a previous visit in 2007.
It started out in darkness. Glass was introduced with only his familiar voice. There was clapping. Glass continued to talk, but it was still dark. The clapping trickled out, uncertain.
“The nice thing about being in a radio is that you don’t have to deal with how somebody looks,” Glass said. “You just look into their heart. … There’s an intimacy in hearing somebody’s voice in the invisibility of radio.”
And then there was light. Sitting in the middle of the spotlight behind a black-clothed table with a radio player, a microphone and a bottle of water, Glass had a look that made him appear to be right at home, yet caught in the headlight.
“Hello, nice to see you,” Glass said.
With salt-and-pepper hair, black-rimmed glasses and a shy smile, Glass looked every bit as unremarkable as his voice — but like the show he turns out each week, he registered a stance of comfort, ease and conversational intimacy.
Yet, the moment he spoke, he caused the audience to break into continuous laughter; he is also a performer and entertainer. Indeed, Glass has every quality of the ultimate storyteller.
Each week, Glass and his This American Life team piece together a mosaic of field reporting, interview recordings and readings all under a common theme. What sets This American Life apart from other broadcast journalism works is that all these real-life personal stories are woven together by Glass’ artful narration, which is at times witty and dry-humored and at other times empathetic and pensive. And of course, each story structure is pulled through by music that is appropriately suspenseful or uplifting.
During the two-hour session, Glass played various clips from his show to demonstrate the craft of a successful radio program that has consistently rated at the top of iTunes. Unlike broadcast television, there are no colorful visuals. Still, Glass shows how skillful structure and a humble interest for discovery can bring storytelling alive.
“We’re trying to restore the world as a place of joy and humor,” Glass said. “Journalism just seems too grim these days.”
That’s the problem with typical journalism of this age, Glass said. According to him, journalists have lost the joy of discovery and humor as they take on austere, “unamused” expressions and a posture of superiority.
But Glass prefers to go against traditional forms of journalism and instead bring himself down to the level of his audience by being just as surprised, interested and touched by the stories of the people he interviews.
In the same vein of humility, Glass also played an old tape of his early work at National Public Radio, which was cringingly bad.
“There is so much error in there that I don’t even know where to begin,” Glass said amid much laughter, adding that an editor even told him that he had “no talent whatsoever.”
In light of it all, Glass brought a universal message to all students: In whatever work you do, it’s actually normal to be bad — and to be bad for a while. Even the most successful career-makers started out bad.
But with a genuine interest in the world and humble curiosity, Glass has edged himself into the homes of millions of Americans, entrancing them with tales of the individuals in this world.
I don’t understand why people are judging Sophia like they’ve never been a little bit of a nuisance. Unless you’ve never been the person who: plays the music on their ipod too loud at the metro, munches on their popcorn with a little too much relish at the movie theater,  or left your car parked on top of the dividing line of two parking spots– then i invite you to come back down to solid ground with the rest of us human beings and off your high horse.
I will always admire Ms. Lee’s writing and the truth that’s always attached to her writing. Those two reasons alone are enough to keep me going back to her blog every post and coming back to read Daily Trojan posts written by HER. 
Yes, she probably was a huge distraction and I understand everyone’s annoyance with her distraction. I would’ve been peeved and annoyed too, but there are always two sides to a story. Instead of blaming her, I actual feel the opposite. I read Ms. Lee’s blog every week and have come to realise what a hard and determined worker she is. Having the ridiculous deadline moved on her suddenly, she was almost forced to bring the laptop with her to complete her job. As she also said in her post, she could’ve just got up and went home, but she didn’t. Her determination to get her job done kept her going.  “I’m proud to be a writer for my school newspaper. I actually really do admire and like my editors, who work really hard and are generally good people. And Ira Glass is cool, and my schoolmates deserve to know about his coolness.” I will not tell others what to do, but as a person with many flaws myself, I have much sympathy for Ms. Lee. Nobody is perfect, everybody has done something wrong in their lives. I just read her most recent post, and Ms. Lee obviously sees and understands her mistakes and are learning from them. I will always be a fan of her blog and writing. If she ever gets fired for being determined to please everyone (but herself), then I surely will never read the Daily Trojan again. In fact, the only reason I know about and read the Daily Trojan is because Ms. Lee is one of their writers. With that said, Chin up Sophia Lee, you’ll always have a fan and reader in me because I really do think your writing is superb, honest, and refreshing. You can’t always please everybody, my friend. No more tears, chin up, chest out, and strut proud! :-D
Sophia posted on her food blog: “To read the feature I wrote on Ira Glass’s speech in 18 minutes under hallucinating state, check this out. I got a rather nasty comment on it too, which threw me back a bit, but then hey, lesson learned: don’t pick up an assignment when you are half-dead.” 
I usually admire Sophia’s blog for her bravery and determination and down-to-earth enthusiasm, but I was not impressed with the above statement.   I simply don’t think it’s in good taste to brag about how little time you spent on an assignment.  Also, reading over this DT article, I don’t think any of the comments on this article are “nasty”–no flaming or disrespect; simply honesty. 
Good writers have bad days; if you try your best and don’t do well, it’s understandable because you still tried.  But it is irresponsible to brag about not even trying very hard.
One more thing.  I just read the blog post that Ms. Lee linked in response to Disturbed Fan, and if it is true that her editor is the one that suggested she take her laptop to the show and whip up an article while the show was still in progress, then I am even more dissapointed with this whole situation.
I’m interested in reading the blog response that Sophia Lee posted. Could you please post the link or point me in the right direction? Thank you.
I have to completely agree with Disturbed Fan.  I was also at the show and quite annoyed by the reporter’s obvious lack of respect for the fans who were actually there to enjoy Ira Glass.  And reading this review is, quite frankly, even more annoying to me than her behavior at the show.  She does Ira and the Daily Trojan a disservice.  It is very clear that she was only there because she had to be and was either napping or shoveling (loud) food into her face instead of being a real reporter or reviewer.  
If the DT believes this is acceptable behavior and reporting from their staff, then that is a shame.  And I definitely won’t be reading any more reviews from Ms. Lee since I don’t find her credible whatsoever.
As a fellow Trojan and This American Life fan, I am disturbed by the quality of this article and the behavior of the reporter. After being politely requested to put away her laptop by the Bovard staff due to its brilliant glare, the reporter relocated to my row, where her loud keyboard clacking, repeated rustling of candy wrappers, and extremely loud eating of the candy was a major distraction. I’m not sure how she felt comfortable writing this article at all, actually, considering that she fell asleep multiple times — guess that explains why she described one of the most unique and warm voices on American radio as “unremarkable” and “dry”.
Ira Glass was gracious in his gift of time and energy to the USC community. He, and all other guests and performers deserve far more respect than to be treated by our news publications in this manner. The DT should pay more careful attention to how they are representing themselves and the Trojan community at large during these events. 
Thanks.

A team put together by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges will visit USC this week for the final part of the university’s reaccreditation process.
Every 10 years USC goes through the reaccreditation process, which gives a school credibility as an institution of higher education, said Robin Romans, associate provost for Undergraduate Programs and accreditation liaison officer.
“Accreditation is a process of quality assurance that’s developed in the U.S. It’s a way to ensure that institutions are fulfilling their mission and meeting the public’s expectation of accountability,” Romans said.
All top universities in the nation are accredited, Romans said, with the WASC being the sole institution that can accredit schools in California.
Attending an accredited university benefits students immensely, he said.
“It certainly says that your degree is of high quality,” Romans said.
Accreditation is also necessary for universities to be able to award government aid from state or national grants.
It takes three to five years for universities to go through the accreditation process, which consists of three stages. The process for USC’s most recent accreditation began in 2005, and the school is expected to be reaccreditated in February.
According to Romans, the chances of USC not getting reaccredited are next to zero; the process doesn’t worry the university.
“We know USC will be reaccredited,” Romans said. “For USC, the important part of accreditation is what we learn from peers at other academic institutions who serve on our visiting team.”
The first stage is the institutional proposal, which was submitted to the WASC committee in October 2005. In this report, the university accreditation team stated the mission of USC and what it hoped to accomplish. Goals cited in the report were to achieve interdisciplinary education and to be a learner-centered institution, according to Romans.
After the WASC accreditation committee accepted USC’s proposal, the university moved on to stage two: the capacity and prepatory review. In this report, USC had to show the WASC that the university had the capacity and means needed to fulfill the goals in the first report.
The committee answered questions regarding the diversity and competence of its faculty, among other things. Similar questions were answered about the student population. The report also focused on undergraduates and how to improve qualifications, increase retention and graduation rates, and enhance diversity.
The visiting team, chaired by former president of Harvard University Derek Curtis Bok, includes six distinguished faculty members from universities around the nation and one from New Zealand.
“One of the interesting parts of accreditation in the U.S. is that it includes a peer review component,” Romans said. “When they review our presentation, visit campus and make recommendations, they do so from the vantage point of faculty members at other research universities.”
When the visiting team comes to campus, they will meet with several groups and write a report,  with recommendations to USC. The team  will then be talking to faculty, various administrators, staff members and students.
Any student can and is encouraged to participate in the accreditation process by sending an e-mail to wascusc@yahoo.com. Commenters’ identities will be held from USC’s accreditation team.
Romans says that it is important for the WASC committee to see what students have to say because it could raise issues that the university might have overlooked, and this can lead to new recommendations or critiques for USC.
“It’s important that your institution learns from itself. You foster a culture of self-improvement that way,” he said.

Starting fall 2011, USC master of communication and public administration degrees will be offered online  to meet an increased demand from students.
Students enrolled in the online program will have access to the same faculty who teach on campus and will develop online virtual communities while still partaking in the Trojan Family, said Jack Knott, dean of the School of Policy Planning and Development.
“The online program offers the opportunity to provide a quality, state-of-the-art education to the 21st-century students,” Knott said. “[The program] fits students’ learning style through the Internet and social networking and it fits students’ lifestyle of juggling careers, family and education.”
Founded in 1995, Embanet has provided USC with the program to offer online courses. It has been one of the pioneering companies in offering online services to students, said Paul Gleason, senior vice president of Educational Operations at Embanet.
For Embanet, offering online courses is vital to those students who want to pursue graduate education but don’t have the means of doing so in a classroom.
“Each course is specifically built to deliver learning in interactive ways to achieve curriculum learning outcomes. Ultimately, our greatest accomplishment is bringing high quality to students and institutions together,” Gleason said.
For the master of public administration, acceptance into the program is extremely competitive with an expected enrollment of 85 students in the first year, Knott said. Within the next four years, the goal is for 200 new students to be enrolled in the program.
“It is important that we enter the market early and establish our presence,” Knott said.
For USC, Embanet will provide program and course conversion, marketing and enrollment services, online faculty training, student services and technology development and support.
“It accommodates students who cannot come to USC’s campus in person, who need a more flexible schedule for professional or personal reasons,” said Ernest J. Wilson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, in an e-mail.
USC began exploring the advancement and opportunities of online learning within the past couple of years, Gleason said.
Knott said there has been a demand for these online courses, and a survey revealed that alumni have strong interest and support for an online degree.
To begin the stages of building this online education program, Embanet must work closely with the faculty to create a pseudo-campus learning environment while also building up a strong student assembly.
Some students feel that being able to get a master’s degree online will benefit those struggling to juggle career and work, while others are more skeptical.
Stevee Eads, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said online  learning will be detrimental to the success of the student and their academic endeavors.
“I don’t think this is a good idea because students need one-on-one interactions. You don’t get the full understanding or experience unless you are learning first hand,” Eads said.
While not totally opposed to it, Tim Baumann, a sophomore majoring in business administration, is skeptical of whether the quality of work that goes into earning a master’s degree will be up to the same standards as in previous years because of the attitude some students have toward online classes.
“I wonder if employers and other academic instructions are going to feel the same skeptical feelings and whether or not that is going to make USC look less like the prestigious academic institution it is and more like the other run-of-the-mill online universities that serve a different function than I believe USC does,” Baumann said.
On the other hand, some students said they feel this type of learning is inevitable because of how strong the Internet has become.
“It’s a good idea because the Internet and education are continuing to intertwine. More classes and books are being offered online. If you can get a degree by not leaving your home, it will be much easier, especially if commuting is tough,” said Alex Matros, a sophomore majoring in business administration and cinematic arts.
Whether the students are in favor of it or not, the online opportunity to earn a master’s degree will be launched in the fall 2011.
“I am hoping that students will use the skills and knowledge they receive in our first-rate MPA degree to make a significant contribution to their community, the country or internationally,” Knott said.

The Department of Performance Venues has experienced serious understaffing problems after the opening of the much-anticipated Ronald Tutor Campus Center, according to department officials.
Make it work · Drake Smith, a sophomore majoring in jazz  studies, hands out programs to attendees at Bovard Auditorium. - Chloe Stepney | Daily Trojan 
Within the entire division — which manages Bovard Auditorium, Ground Zero Performance Café, the new campus center and other outdoor events — there are only six full-time staff members managing more than 400 students and more than 2,000 events per semester, according to Director of Performance Venues Brandon Operchuck.
“We’re feeling people’s frustration because we’re slow to respond to requests and telephone calls,” Operchuck said.
Before, USC’s Commons was not staffed enough to indicate the demand the department was going to experience with the addition of the campus center, Operchuck said. Staff members are scrambling for enough time to get everything done.
“We knew it was going to be big. But the demand of the building clearly overshadowed what the expectation was and what it would take to operate. We’re working hard to get to the point of appropriately serving our community,” Operchuck said.
The understaffing dilemma poses two problems: The department is weeks behind on its paperwork, and many events have to be rebooked because of a sudden change in the capacity limits implemented by the fire marshal.
As part of signing off on the campus center, the fire marshal lowered the anticipated capacity from 1,283 people to around 980. What might seem like a small change, Operchuck said, forced the department to reconfigure scheduled events to abide by the new limits.
“For the first couple of weeks, all the phone calls we received were not about new events, but it was more about working with people and making their already-planned events happen and dealing with their frustration,” Operchuck said.
The most demanding jobs are understaffed, according to part-time staff member and lighting director Steve Farquhar, a senior majoring in computer science.
Even with the understaffed office, both Farquhar and Operchuck said the part-time student employees come to the job eager and energized and that their desire and passion to help students is evident.
“These 400 students are brilliant. They’re USC students, they’re really smart kids and they work really hard and they’ve given us all they’ve got,” Operchuck said.
The appropriate amount of time needed to train these students is missing, however, which limits the amount of responsibilities new employees can take on, Operchuck said.
“We can’t be asking students to work 40-, 50-, 60-hour weeks. More [student employees] requires more management, more paperwork and all of those things require someone to really be managing them,” Operchuck said. “Our full-time staff is really struggling to manage that to be able to train our wonderful students.”
Farquhar said he has had to take on responsibilities, such as changing lightbulbs and moving equipment, that could be done by other staff members if there was enough time to train them.
“I have a lot of responsibilities for projects — large projects and small projects — that I can’t get to because I have to do these other lower responsibilities,” he said. “More knowledgeable people and more people who have the time to spend would help me do the projects I’d like to get to do instead of the things I have to do now.”
All of the venues that the department oversees are booked every day this fall, except for the Grand Ballroom, Operchuck said.
“We’re very, very busy. The demand and the excitement on the [Ronald Tutor Campus Center] has been tremendous and people have been jumping on this opportunity to improve their events from previous years,” said Lisa Carley, scheduling and event coordinator for Bovard Auditorium, Ground Zero Performance Café and outdoor events.
In previous years, the department didn’t experience as much commotion or as many problems as it is experiencing now, even when it had fewer staff members, Farquhar said.
“In the past we’ve been pretty comfortable. But recently, with the opening of the new campus center and the opening of these new venues, we’ve had all of our usual productions responsibilities plus the responsibilities of opening a new building,” Farquhar said.
With every new building, unexpected problems will inevitably arise, Operchuck said. Despite this, even with the lack of staff, the department is happy with the progression it has made within the last two months.
“We are making it work and we’re doing a pretty good job with all the resources that we do have. It’s not a horrible situation that we’re in right now,” Farquhar said.
With two months down and seven to go until the end of the academic year, Operchuck said the big shock has passed and all he really asks from the community is patience.
“It’s tough to really understand the logistical complexity of managing so many things and different styles of events,” Operchuck said. “This time next year, we will be better in serving the people. It’s a moving target. Everyone is doing their very best to make this possible.”

In an effort to provide students with a basic understanding of how to handle and analyze data, the USC Department of Mathematics now offers a new minor in statistics.
“Whether you’re going to be a journalist or a mathematician, it’s becoming necessary to be able to have a background in analyzing the information in your field,” said Gary Rosen, chairman and a professor of mathematics at USC. “Statistics is really the science of the future.”
Rosen said he was driven to create the minor after reading a New York Times article on the future of statistics.
“The article focuses on how statistics is becoming to be more and more of a useful skill that is increasing in demand for employers,” Rosen said. “With the world expanding with technology every day, Internet-age statisticians are needed to work with large data sets for many popular companies.”
Statistics is the process of making an estimate on certain numbers associated with a population based on a sample. The program is designed for students who want to acquire a basic understanding of modern statistics and will teach students how to handle and analyze large data sets.
The interdisciplinary minor is available to students pursuing any major. There is one math prerequisite, and it requires eight units of math and another eight units of electives in statistics that can be fulfilled in any department.
Statistics is not offered as an undergraduate major, but the school does offer the subject as a master’s degree.
“Since we don’t have a specific statistics department, nobody really takes it upon themselves to start a major or minor. Somebody had to do it,” Rosen said.
Douglas Capone, chair of the Department of Biological Sciences, said he believes the minor can be a possible complement to a biology degree and other degrees at USC.
“There are benefits from understanding biomedical statistics. Many companies will be looking for students who are skilled in analyzing data from the results of different experiments in medicine,” Capone said.
Rosen said many students are most likely unaware that the new minor is available.
“People with all sorts of graduate degrees such as comparative studies and humanities are going back to school to get their master’s in statistics because it makes one so incredibly employable,” Rosen said.
Ross Mead, a doctoral student studying computer science and minoring in math, said he would be interested in the minor if it concentrated on a certain type of statistics related to his degree.
“I have to do a lot of studies with human relations and robotics, so it would be helpful to have a minor where I could take classes focused on statistics in engineering,” Mead said. “You wouldn’t think statistics relates to a lot of different majors, but it can be applied to many things.”

Ever since young Americans gained the right to vote at age 18 in 1971, we’ve failed to capitalize on it. We’ve been left as a traditionally underrepresented group in elections, even though many issues concern us just as much as they do our parents and grandparents. As an age group, 18- to 24-year-olds consistently lag behind the rest of the electorate by as much as 25 percent in voter turnout.
Many of those working to remedy that statistic have identified the fact that the large number of unregistered students is a prevailing reason for low voter turnout among the younger demographic (with the obvious exception of the last presidential election, which showed a marginal increase in young voter turnout).
Thus, efforts to get students into the voting booths are rampant — I’ve received three voter registration applications since the beginning of the semester, and first-time voters especially are being targeted various efforts to boost voter registration.
Still, the answer to our unflagging political apathy is not going to be answered by registering voters en masse. The quality of our voters is more important than the quantity.
Voter registration should not be as big a concern as voter education. Creating a few thoughtful, knowledgeable young voters is more important than registering hundreds of indifferent voters who will end up voting on party lines or on popularity.
To truly represent the concerns of young adult voters, we need to know what the candidates say about relevant issues, and such information should be readily available to young people.
Common reasons for not voting are excuses such as “I don’t know enough about politics” or “I don’t really care how the election turns out.”
Neither of these issues is addressed by registering more voters; in fact, simply registering young people only reinforces this cycle of political apathy.
These newly registered voters will not participate in elections with informed intelligence, but their registration will be considered a victory by statisticians whose goals are only to register voters and not educate them.
In trying to register so many young adults to vote, people think that this age group will become sufficiently interested in politics to research issues and make thoughtful choices on Election Day.
But there’s a disconnect in this logic: Registering a voter does not necessarily ensure political participation, or, more importantly, intelligent political participation.
What often happens is that a student will register to vote through these popularized voter registration drives, but come Election Day, he will end up not voting — or worse, voting without discretion. “Yeah, I remember hearing about that guy on a commercial. He’s the only one I’ve heard of. OK, I’ll vote for him.”
The issue is compounded in midyear elections, where voters know even less about the candidates or the issues.
This upcoming election will most likely tell the same story — young adults, who so proudly mailed in those voter registration forms, will, if they end up voting at all, play “eeny, meeny, miny, moe” and blindly choose which candidates to support.
Another resort for the uninformed voter might be strictly voting on party lines.
Younger voters tend to associate more with the Democratic Party, and though mass registration drives might work in the favor of democrats, they do little to increase the amount of civic awareness among our age bracket.
Essentially, young people who vote and fail to research the issues become pawns in the games of party politics.
I’m not saying that an average middle-aged American is necessarily going to know more about Proposition 23 than a college student, but what is important is that young adults are often told to register to vote when they really don’t want to. If they don’t care enough to register on their own, then will they care enough to research the issues and vote intelligently?
I’m all for young people voting. We just need to be smart about how we increase voter participation among youth — blanketing voter registration forms and trying to get students to register to vote might be part of the solution, but it’s not all of it.

“These newly registered voters will not participate in elections with informed intelligence, but their registration will be considered a victory by DEMOCRATS whose goals are only to USE THE YOUNG and not educate them.”

Observation is constant in our generation. We observe each other. We observe ourselves. We observe media, and media most certainly observes us. But as technology gives us the power to observe each other further, you have to wonder where the line is drawn between the informative and the invasive.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
On campus, this question manifests itself in the ubiquitous education tool Blackboard.
Lauded for its easy interface, communication abilities, organization and environmentally conscious benefits, we tend to hear less about the activity-monitoring capabilities of the program, such as Blackboard AttendancePro, a feature that gives professors and administrators more insight into the time we spend online than we’re probably aware of.
The company’s website boasts the sites advantages with questions such as “What if your enrollment team could monitor students’ activity and progress within the online learning environment?” and  “What if your instructors could not only track logins and downloaded content, but also monitor online discussions and other collaborative forums in which students have participated?”
To me those sound like an uneasy step away from “What if your professor slept on the futon in your room and accompanied you to class, the library and occasionally The Row?”
It’s no surprise that our generation’s technological strides would eventually start to close the disconnect between professors and students. And in the form of discussion forums and grade spreadsheets that enhance accessibility and communication, I’m on board.
Putting aside my qualms about what automated education is becoming, however, I think this monitoring can be taken a step too far.
The professor raised the issue voiced her own unease about over monitoring her students’ activity on Blackboard, recognizing that there should be a certain degree of autonomy to an education, particularly a collegiate one where we’re all allegedly learning to become more independent and require less supervision.
Perhaps these tools are appropriate in middle schools when quizzes were necessary to check if you’d read your Judy Blume that day.
But shouldn’t adult students be given the chance to sink or swim without records of time spent on each screen? It feels like an educational model fit for a scaled-down George Orwell novel. I don’t want to wax paranoid, but it does seem that many students aren’t aware their teachers are monitoring students’ activities on Blackboard.
And although there aren’t likely to be notable repercussions or invasion of privacy lawsuits, it does seem a tad unfair that professors are privy to how much time students spend on homework and when they spend it.
Though teachers are professional enough to assign grades without factoring that in, you have to wonder if you might one day be unconsciously marked down because your professor found out that you started your paper an hour before the midnight deadline and turned it in at 11:58 p.m.
Of course, these surveillance technologies aren’t unique to the classroom. Ever wondered how the ads on Google and Facebook are so perfectly tailored to you?
Facebook, for instance, cleverly bases the advertisements running beside your newsfeed on the content of your profile. Obviously, the concept of target demographics isn’t new — there’s a reason why Rock’em Sock’em Robots are more prevalently advertised on Nickelodeon than Rogaine.
But it’s one thing to find coupons for jeggings in a tabloid and another to see ads for the day care center down the road from your home while surfing the Internet.
Google’s AdSense operates similarly, using information gathered from past interactions with the advertisers to pander to your specific demographic.
Furthermore, the content of the e-mails you write are scanned for matches with advertisers, as are your demonstrated Internet behaviors. For example, if you placed a set of Bose headphones in an online shopping cart but never actually made the purchase, don’t be surprised to see them appear in your Google advertisements soon thereafter.
The Internet has provided us with a double-edged sword. While voyeurism and exhibitionism are on the rise with sites as seemingly harmless as Facebook, and the more dicey ChatRoulette, the pervasive element of personal information gathering can extend to programs such as Blackboard, where we don’t necessarily expect it.
And in all fairness, there doesn’t seem to be a lot of explicit harm to students in their teachers being able to see the time they’ve logged studying online.
But to many users, the Web is a one-way mirror; we’ll spend hours studying the line-up of suspects, observing them mercilessly without hesitation because it seems like no one is peering back.
Au contraire, Generation Y; there are always fingerprints.

Even in defeat, it seems Lane Kiffin and Co. didn’t leave Palo Alto going down without a fight.
Less than 24 hours after watching Stanford’s Nate Whitaker kick a 30-yard field goal at the buzzer to propel the No.16-ranked Cardinal to a 37-35 victory over the Trojans, Kiffin made sure to let the Pac-10 know he was less than pleased with officiating blunders that took place throughout USC’s second straight defeat.
“There’s a number of issues,” Kiffin said in response to why he filed a formal complaint Sunday morning. “The entire game there was never a flag that was a judgment call [on Stanford]. Only for offsides or false starts.”
In addition to being irked about the lack of judgment calls made in favor of the cardinal and gold, Kiffin also managed to direct a sarcastic quip in the direction of Stanford’s head coach Jim Harbaugh in regard to the disparity of flags thrown during their instant classic — eight penalties for USC to only three thrown against the Cardinal.
“I’m going to have to ask coach Harbaugh in the offseason how he does such a nice job,” Kiffin quipped.
Although the subject of yellow flags made up the majority of his formal complaint, Kiffin was also irate about clock management. And unlike against Washington, this time the finger wasn’t pointed in the other direction.
After senior running back Allen Bradford’s 10-yard run to the Stanford 3-yard line with 1:08 remaining in the fourth quarter, the clock should have started running after a 10-second reprieve for the chain gang.
On Saturday night, the clock however stayed unchanged. The next play resulted in a Bradford touchdown, and little outrage was expressed on the Trojans’ sideline. But Sunday, Kiffin’s tune was slightly less celebratory on the matter.
“The clock is supposed to start,” Kiffin said. “We huddled up to take our time. It should have started. We were even faking audibles. They never started the clock. I expressed myself [to the Pac-10].”
Pac-10 Commissioner Larry Scott was in attendance Saturday night, but the conference has not acknowledged whether or not it is looking into USC’s complaint.

According to a recently released internal federal review, the U.S. Forest Service delayed ordering additional firefighters and other resources that could have helped stop the 2009 Station Fire in order to reduce spending.
The review, which was conducted by the Agriculture Department, also revealed that the Forest Service chose only to focus their efforts on the hillside neighborhoods and structures located on Mt. Wilson, leaving the backcountry area of the fire unmanaged as it reached Angeles National Park.
Los Angeles-area house members plan to address the findings with former and present Forest Service authorities and L.A. County Fire Department officials in a public panel Tuesday morning in Pasadena.
“[The review] raises serious questions about whether a Forest Service policy intended to limit costs prevented the timely use of resources… This will certainly be one of the important issues I intend to raise,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D- Burbank) said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times.
The fire was the largest in Los Angeles County history, with 250 square miles and more than 200 structures destroyed by the flames.

It shouldn’t have worked. On paper the idea was ludicrous. A day where major path through Los Angeles — the very definition of a car-dominated area — blocked car access in favor of bicycles, skateboards and joggers would never succeed.
And yet it did.
With an estimated 100,000 people turning out for the event, it appears that Los Angeles’ first CicLAvia was a success. With the idea taken from Colombia’s decades-old Ciclovía event, CicLAvia turned a major path through the city into a cyclist or runner’s paradise in hopes of raising awareness of other forms of transportation.
Although no set party or festival was planned by organizers, CicLAvia-goers gathered along the path, playing games of dodgeball and a enjoying wide arrange of food trucks parked along the streets.
The city is currently planning multiple events for 2011 and hopes to make things weekly in 2012. Is it enough to kill Los Angeles car culture? No way. That would be like eliminating cabs from New York City. However, CicLAvia has shown that Angelenos are up for some variety in their daily movement. And isn’t that what the city needs?

Stanford just had USC’s number on Saturday — in more than one sport. While the football team suffered a heartbreaking loss to the Cardinal in Palo Alto, the No. 1-ranked water polo team also fell on the road, losing to No. 6 Stanford 5-3.
The loss drops the team’s record to 15-1 and snaps an 18-game winning streak that dated back to last season. Even so, the Trojans are now 70-3 since the beginning of the 2008 season, and are the two-time defending NCAA champions.
The top six of the water polo rankings will likely experience a large reshuffling when the weekly poll comes out on Wednesday; in addition to Stanford’s upset win, No. 4 California upset No. 2 UCLA in Berkeley Saturday.
No. 3 UC-Irvine has a chance to claim the top spot in the poll, despite losses to USC, UCLA and UC-Santa Barbara this season. The Anteaters went 2-0 on the week, defeating Pepperdine and Air Force. They also defeated Cal earlier in the season.
UC-Santa Barbara, currently ranked No. 5, also is 2-0 since the last poll. The Gauchos defeated Concordia and Harvard to try and stake their claim in the top five.
The Trojans will play a huge match this Saturday, as Cal comes into town to try and avenge a loss suffered earlier this season. On Sept. 19, the Trojans traveled to Berkeley and defeated the top-ranked Golden Bears 12-11.
The match starts at 10 A.M. at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.

Match.com and eHarmony users living in Santa Monica can now rest easy — a 1954 city law banning dating services will most likely be repealed Tuesday.
The Santa Monica Daily Press has reported that the City Council will review the ordinance, which prohibits “personal introductory service, marriage bureau, lonely hearts club, or other business of a like nature” from operating within the city. The ordinance will most likely be overturned, the Daily Press reported.
Though no one really knows what exactly a lonely hearts club is, the ordinance means that online dating services like eHarmony — which, as LAist points out, is moving its corporate headquarters from Pasadena to Santa Monica — can’t operate in Santa Monica.
A City Hall report cited the evolution of dating services since the law was enacted as one of the factors behind changing the ordinance.
“With the advent of computer technology, personal introduction and dating services have expanded and become a common and reputable way to meet others for social interaction,” the report said.
One common, though perhaps not as reputable, method of social interaction will not be permitted in the city, however. Officials plan to keep the ban on escort services in place, the Daily Press reported.

Although many concerns and debates have risen regarding education funding in California, a new study has shown that the state annually invests nearly half a billion dollars on students that do not return for their sophomore year of college.
The report, titled “Finishing the First Lap: The Cost of First Year Student Attrition in America’s Four Year College or Universities,” took data from 2003 through 2008 in order to analyze the total amount of tax dollars that go toward freshmen in college who do not return for a second year.
It ranked California, Texas and New York as the top three states, with California first at $467 million.
The report does not take into consideration students who transfer into other institutions to complete their degree nor does it acknowledge students’ reason for dropping out of school. The report does not factor in population of the states as well.
“We need to start thinking about students as clients and start asking what do they need and how do we satisfy their needs,” Mark Schneider, author of the study, said to the Los Angeles Times.
Schneider also said that the report is not an advocacy for “disinvestment in higher education but rather a challenge for state governments to demand institutions to do a better job.”
