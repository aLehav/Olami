After more than 135 days of television coverage that the infamous O.J. Simpson murder case received, the spotlight has officially returned to Simpson in the upcoming FX series The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, which is set to premiere Feb. 2, 2016. The star-studded docudrama, featuring Cuba Gooding Jr. as Simpson, will re-enact the “most high-profile criminal trial in U.S. history,” according to The Hollywood Reporter.
The drama-filled trailer gives prospective viewers a glimpse into what creators Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski plan to unveil as the complete narrative behind the case, uncovering more details than the 1994 televised trial did. Now 22 years later, the unique true crime anthology TV series brings viewers familiar faces like John Travolta and David Schwimmer as Simpson’s attorneys Robert Shapiro and Robert Kardashian, respectively, to represent the familiar faces behind the real-life crime story, based on the book The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson written by Jeffrey Toobin.
Gooding confessed to The Hollywood Reporter about the doubts he faced about personifying the 46-year-old former USC and NFL star and alleged murderer of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and friend Ronald Goldman. “There was one day after filming that I went to my trailer and I couldn’t stop crying because I realized I never even considered the loss for the Goldman or Brown family,” the Academy Award winner said. “Back then, I was just so relieved that another black man got away from the injustice that was the LAPD. I was just so relieved that they didn’t screw us over again.”
Although the show tries to remain unbiased throughout the 10-episode retelling of the case, the issue of race serves a prominent role as the historic 1994 case followed the 1992 Rodney King riots in which race relations between African Americans and the LAPD were strained. Late attorney Johnnie Cochran, played by actor Courtney B. Vance, stood at the forefront of both Simpson’s acclaimed defense team and the devout black community. As the trial ultimately ended with Simpson’s acquittal, African Americans celebrated as 72 percent of their population saw him as innocent, according to a poll taken by the Washington Post at the time the verdict was announced.
But portraying an exonerated African American man was only half of the job that Gooding had. The 48-year-old actor, who is the same age Simpson was during the time of the trial, wanted to focus on the exalted football star turned actor as opposed to the currently incarcerated, dispirited Simpson. Gooding did not wish to visit Simpson in jail to prepare for his performance because of the psychological toll incarceration has on its victims.
“I have a lot of friends and family who are incarcerated, and I know what that jail cell does to your psyche,” he said. “I didn’t want him to take me into that frame of mind. He was the O.J. Simpson who everyone loved … and in that cage, he’s a ruined man.”
Aside from his present brokenness, The People v. O.J. Simpson strives to go beyond “O.J. Simpson the man, it’s really about the case itself and the lawyers on both sides,” said actress Sarah Paulson, who plays head prosecutor Marcia Clark, told Variety. The holistic perspective of the show will allow viewers to shape their own opinions about the case and decide for themselves whether they believe Simpson to be innocent or not. After intensive research on the case was conducted, alongside a close reading of Toobin’s book, the first season sets to encapsulate the tension, emotion and moral ambiguity of the so-called “Trial of the Century.”
With the first season outlined, American Crime Story has already prepared for its second installment with its focus on Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 disaster that took a deadly and costly toll on the entire nation, not just the Atlantic region. Executive producer Ryan Murphy plans to follow a specific group of people and delve into their tragic lives of seeking refuge from inside the Louisiana Superdome to local hospitals during the aftermath.
“I want this show to be a socially conscious, socially aware examination of different types of crime around the world,” Murphy said. “And in my opinion, Katrina was a f—ing crime — a crime against a lot of people who didn’t have a strong voice and we’re going to treat it as a crime. That’s what this show is all about.”

Beyoncé caused panic Monday when she popped up on campus to rehearse for the 2016 Super Bowl. It is only logical to begin this week’s column with Queen Bey, no matter how briefly.
We all woke up on Dec. 13, 2013 and the world was a better place, because Beyoncé had released her eponymous fifth studio album. The album was a big deal because there was no previous announcement or promotion. It was an even bigger deal because of the topics her songs touched on: concerns about motherhood, bulimia and feminism.
“Flawless” is perhaps the most uplifting song from the album. When it was released as a single in August 2014, it quickly became the song of the summer; not only because Beyoncé had girls, guys and everyone else singing “I woke up like this,” but because the song was split in two by an extract from “We Should All Be Feminists,” a TedxEuston speech by award-winning Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.
“Feminist: the person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes,” Adichie ends her ‘verse’ in “Flawless”, shattering the stereotype of the man-hating, bra-burning, angry female with one sentence.
After receiving critical acclaim, Adichie adapted her speech into a book that hits home on all the major points of what feminism is-— and why we should all be feminists.
“We Should All Be Feminists” is a pocket-sized introduction to what it is like to be a female in the 21st century. Adichie relates sexist incidents she and her female friends face in Nigeria and the U.S., providing a critical view into how similar misogynist culture is in a ‘third world country’ and the world’s only superpower.
“Some people ask, ‘why the word feminist? Why not just say you are a believer in human rights?’ Because that would be dishonest. Feminism is, of course, part of human rights in general – but to choose to use the vague expression human rights is to deny the specific and particular problem of gender,” writes Adichie.
Although she doesn’t mention it specifically, Adichie’s explanation of the use of “feminist” addresses issues like the rise of Men’s Rights Activists and “meninists,” which are groups for those who believe men are being oppressed.
Adichie does not hate men and boys, although she has been accused of it. In later passages from “We Should All Be Feminists,” Adichie acknowledges that poor men do have a hard time. However, as she points out, gender and class are decidedly different, and even poor men still have the privilege of being male.
The privilege of being male includes feeling safer than a woman would while walking alone at night; being more likely to receive a job promotion; and making more money than a woman by virtue of being a man.
While, as Adichie writes, “gender is not an easy conversation to have,” it is about time we initiate discourse about it. Not only for our sake, but for the sake of the future generations. For the sake of our future daughters and their daughter. Even for the sake of our future sons. Misogyny does not only affect females, it also hurts males.
“We do a great disservice to boys in how we raise them,” writes Adichie. “We stifle the humanity of boys. We define masculinity in a very narrow way. Masculinity is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside this cage.”
Parenthetically, to facilitate this discussion in Sweden, every Swedish 16-year-old will be receiving a copy of Adichie’s “call to arms,” according to The Guardian.
“We Should All Be Feminists” addresses emotionally-heavy topics, but Adichie manages to weave a light thread of humor throughout the book. At one point, she called herself a “Happy African Feminist Who Does Not Hate Men and Who Likes to Wear Lip Gloss and High Heels for Herself and Not for Men.” The excessively long title was her old self’s way of justifying being a feminist. That is, until she decided to become unapologetic for being a woman. Now she goes by Feminist, with a capital “F” but still lip-gloss loving.

Some of them hate men.
Has anyone not noticed how they are now targeting CHILDREN? Like General Mao with the little red book, or Hitler’s Mein Kamp and his Youth, Lenin’s give me your children for four years and the seeds I sow you will protect for a lifetime or even the religious texts of your choice. They all depend on an audience who is not fully capable to think through the information presented. Especially if there is a complete absence of any other perspectives. Like a fish does not know it is wet, these INDOCTRINATED children will spout such things as readily as asking a North Korean how they like living there with the state approved response, “Its the greatest place to live.”
Funny how these image damage control article for feminist activism come out around the same time. You folks are really in a desperate state to get people to identify with your cult.
Anyways, you feminists don’t hate men, you hate masculine men and seek to make them passive, effeminate, and self loathing. Also, there is no female oppression in nations like Sweden, Denmark, Canada, UK, and U.S. But of course, that doesn’t fit well with the self serving agenda of feminists who clearly have no real solutions for women in nations like Afghanistan.
You feminists cherry-pick, exploit, and manipulate. You offer counterfeit solutions and you politicize daily life and you have actually worsened the relationship between men and women.
If Feminists really cared about equality, they would call themselves humanists.
There is no reason a woman should not call herself feminist, if she is fighting for equal human rights. She can call herself humanist as well but trying to create a taboo against calling oneself feminist is the same old stinkin’ poop.
..
“Feminist: the person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes,”
If that was all that was required to be a feminist, then I would be considered a feminist but its not and I’m not. Numerous secondary beliefs are also required to be considered a feminist (such as rape culture, $0.77 for every $1, the patriarchy, that men hate women, etc.) Since I reject virtually ever belief advocated by feminism except being a person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes I consider myself an anti-feminist.
“The privilege of being male includes feeling safer than a woman would while walking alone at night”
Considering the fact that men are much more likely to be the target of crime while walking alone at night the idea that women should be more afraid than men is pretty offensive to the intelligence of women.
“making more money than a woman by virtue of being a man”
Nope, men make more money on average because they work longer hours and they sacrifice spending time with their families to financially support them.
“being more likely to receive a job promotion”

Pasadena Opera concluded their two-performance run of Carlisle Floyd’s Susannah on Saturday. The sold-out performance was held in the A Noise Within Theatre in Pasadena.
Only in its second season, Pasadena Opera is quickly establishing a name for itself as one of L.A.’s premier opera companies. According to its website, Pasadena Opera strives to “present modern adaptations of timeless stories both old and new,” as well as “invite the public to learn about the process of bringing opera to life.”
Susannah was led by conductor Dana Sadava, who also serves as co-founder and artistic director of Pasadena Opera.
“Being an opera ‘startup’ is challenging, of course,” Sadava said. “[But] in some ways it’s refreshing to starting something from the ground up.  We haven’t inherited old ideas or practices, and we can try new things on a small scale to see if they work.”
Sadava, a Pasadena native, led an on-stage chamber orchestra of 17 instrumentalists. Having the orchestra appear on stage allowed them to be fully be immersed in the staging of the production, as opposed to remaining unseen in an orchestra pit, as is typical with most productions.
Susannah is a complex opera, both in content and execution. The story, which is loosely based upon the biblical story “Susanna,” explores themes of sin, integrity and betrayal. Sadava stated that she chose to present Susannah because of its relevance to everyday audiences.
“I chose Susannah because I was astonished at how relevant it is to our modern-day audience[s],” Davana said. “Being afraid of people who are different from us, getting caught up in vicious gossip, enduring gender inequality and domestic violence … these are all issues in 2016 that are beautifully explored in Susannah.”
Indeed, the ways in which Pasadena Opera chose to present their production differs from more traditional styles of opera staging. What was perhaps most striking about the performance was the intimacy of the experience. Much of the content dealt with in the opera is considerably heavy; the close space allowed the audience to feel as though they were a part of the storyline. In some ways Susannah is aesthetically representative of the style Pasadena Opera hope to achieve.
Likewise, the performance was staged upon a thrust stage, which allowed the audience to immerse parts of the stage. Additionally, some staging occurred beyond the physical set, with singers often utilizing the theater aisles for entrances and exits.
“It’s a controversial, complicated story that will both entertain people and provoke conversation,” Sadava said.
Many of the singers cast in the production, including the principal characters, are young, budding singers on the cusp of established careers. The titular role was sung by soprano Chelsea Basler, who made her West Coast debut with this opera. Basler, a San Diego native, performed with an emotional intensity that was utterly mesmerizing; one couldn’t help but be captivated by her emotional range and ardor.
Equally as enticing was bass-baritone Nicholas Brownlee in the role of Olin Blitch. Brownlee, a current Domingo-Colburn-Stein Young Artist at L.A. Opera, possesses an enormous, full sound that is equally as focused. His scenes with Basler, particularly in Act II, were among the most passionate of the evening.
Pasadena Opera is certainly en-route to becoming a staple within L.A.’s classical music scene. According to Sadava, the amount of support they have received from the community has been astounding.
“It’s clear that people in the Pasadena area want to be involved, either as audience members, donors or volunteers,” Sadava said. “And although we’ve started small with two performances per show, our houses are full. It’s a wonderful feeling.”
More information regarding Pasadena Opera’s future productions can be found online.

The Trojans traveled into a deafening Pauley Pavilion last Wednesday night and trounced the UCLA Bruins 89-75 for their first win versus UCLA since 2013.
Now, the Men of Troy are ranked 21st in the nation and are looking to extend their current 4-1 Pac-12 record on the road against the Oregon Ducks, a team which the Trojans have not defeated on the road since 2009.
As it stands, the Men of Troy have the all-time advantage, defeating the Ducks 60 of out the 112 times the teams have met, however, Oregon has downed USC in 10 straight conference contests and holds home court advantage.
USC head coach Andy Enfield and his Trojans are preparing for a challenging road test against a high-powered Ducks offense.
“Oregon is as talented as any team in the league offensively,” Enfield said. “They have a great home court advantage.”
This season, the Ducks are undefeated at home, sporting an 11-0 record against the likes of Cal, Stanford, Valparaiso and No. 13 Baylor.
Thanks in part to Chris Boucher’s 3.3 blocks per game (ranked second-best in the nation), Oregon has allowed an average of 76.3 points per game, ranked 61st in the nation.
Boucher, a 6-foot-10, 190-pound senior forward, has been instrumental in Oregon’s big front court which features three players 6-foot-9 or taller. USC, on the other hand, has six players who are 6 foot 8 or taller.
Not to mention, it’s not just the low-post players who have height, but Oregon’s top six scorers average 6 foot 6 inches.
Oregon’s roster features four players who average in double digits, including leading scorer Dillon Brooks who has scored 19 points or more in eight games, with just three games in single digits.
In terms of their other offensive weapons, freshman guard Tyler Dorsey has been exceptional shooting the ball in 2015, connecting on 45.8 percent of his three-point attempts, while averaging 14.2 points per game off of 47.2 percent shooting from the floor.
Where Dorsey is really potent, though, is from the free-throw line as he has been able to sink 71.6 percent of his free-throws this year off of 81 shots.
The two main distributors on the Ducks’ offense are guard Casey Benson and forward Dillon Brooks, who combined for 6.3 assists per game.
Considering those offensive weapons and averaging 76.3 points per game, USC will certainly have its hands full on the road.
And while Oregon’s offense has some high-flying players, USC has also impressed on the offensive side of the ball, averaging 84.6 points per game through 18 games, ranking 9th in the country.
Defensively, though, the Ducks can hurt the Trojans by running their press defense, forcing USC to turn the ball over as they have done 13 times per game this season.
Freshman forward Chimezie Metu commented on the difficult nature of trying to score on Oregon’s defense.
“[Oregon] likes to press and like to speed people up,” Metu said. “We’ve had some problems with turnovers the past few games, so we just have to try and be disciplined and try to come out with a win.”
This year the Trojans’ only road loss came at the hands of Washington when USC blew a 22-point lead and turned the ball over 21 times in their two-point loss to the Huskies.
Nevertheless, the 15-3 Trojans are ranked in the top 25 for the first time since 2008 with their best overall record through 18 games since the 1991-1992 season.
Head coach Andy Enfield respects where the Trojans are in the season but understands the severity of this Pac-12 contest.
“We respect what we’ve done so far, and we are glad that we’re ranked,” Enfield said. “We’ve never lost perspective, every game means the same thing in the Pac-12, it’s a win or a loss.”
Freshman forward Chimezie Metu also commented on the Trojans’ recent success and the team’s mental game plan coming into tonight’s battle.
“We’re just trying to come into practice everyday and stay focused and try to listen to our coaches,” Metu said. “We have to be ready to work every day and know that all this can be taken away in a matter of seconds, and you have to come to appreciate what we’ve done and all the work that we’ve put in, and just have fun in the process.”
The Trojans and Ducks are set to play at Matt Arena at 6 p.m.

The No. 15 men’s volleyball team continues MPSF play with their 2016 home opener against No. 9 UC Santa Barbara Thursday night.
Off to their worst overall start since the team’s inaugural season in 1970 and their worst conference start since 2005, the Trojans (0-4, 0-2 MPSF) remain confident that they will break into the win column at home.
“We have the pieces,” junior libero Vinnie Rios said. “We’re putting ourselves in position to win and if we’re able to stay mindful of the opportunities we have, we’ll start getting ’em for sure.”
Staying mindful has certainly been the theme of the week. After Tuesday’s practice, head coach Jeff Nygaard said, “We need to focus on what we’re doing on our side of the net [and] being way more mindful of how we’re approaching the game.”
Meanwhile, the Trojans prepare for a hard-serving Gauchos opponent (5-2, 1-1 MPSF) averaging 1.88 aces/set. Star senior, two-time First-Team All-American setter Jonah Seif has come out firing again this year with career highs in kills/set (.73), hitting percentage (.581), and serving-aces/set (.62). In preparation, the Trojans have worked hard on digging ability against a “revved-up” serving machine, as Nygaard called it.
“We’re facing some guys with live arms,” Nygaard said. “And if we don’t see [the speed] consistently, we’re never gonna catch up to it.”
To win on Thursday night, the Trojans are going to need their key players to have big games. Look for senior middle blocker Tommy Leonard, starting in place of injured Preseason Second-Team All-American Andy Benesh (back), to build off of two solid performances last week in which he averaged 7 kills, 4.5 blocks and a .348 hitting average. Also keep an eye open for the Yoder tandem. Sophomore setter Jack leads the team with 103 assists, 44 of which have gone to his cousin, junior outside hitter, Lucas.
In the uber-competitive MPSF where any team can win on any given night, Jack Yoder says the difference maker is “the amount of energy we bring on [Thursday] night.”
He adds that the team will “absolutely feed off the energy of the home crowd, the band especially,” to give them a necessary boost into the winning column.
The Trojans carry over a six-game home winning streak from last season into Thursday night’s home opener versus the Gauchos, and despite the slow start, Trojan Nation remains completely optimistic. After all, the team remains nationally ranked and gained invaluable experience on the road versus four vicious opponents (No. 10 Penn St., No. 7 Ohio St., No. 12 CSUN, No. 2 Long Beach St.).
As Rios puts it, Thursday night is a chance for the maturing Trojans to “show fans what we’re really capable of, and getting a win is the best way to show ’em we’re still here to compete and looking for that national championship at the end of the year.”

The timing of USC men’s basketball’s rather quick ascent back to the top of the Pac-12 standings and national polls doesn’t come as a complete surprise.
Two and a half years ago, I had the chance to sit down with former assistant coach Dieter Horton to discuss the future of USC basketball just a few months after a gap-toothed coach on the rise out of Fort Myers, Florida, was tapped on the shoulder to take on the intricate task of leading Trojans hoops back to regional and national relevancy.
At the time, Horton, who was about to enter his fourth season at USC as a special assistant, said that it would likely take three years to rebuild the program.
“No program is transformed overnight and it could take a few years before we get to where we want to be, which is ultimately the Elite Eight or Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament,” Horton said in August 2013. The Trojans haven’t accomplished either of those feats in just shy of a decade, and given that the team finished a subpar 14-18 under the combined direction of Kevin O’Neill and Bob Cantu the season prior, that benchmark seemed somewhat unrealistic.
Horton is now the head coach at Cal State Los Angeles, but he was actually right on cue about where the program would be at this point in juncture  — back on the national forefront.
Enter stage right Andy Enfield, who in year three, just as Horton predicted, has USC basketball back in the Top 25 for the first time since 2008, ranked No. 21 in the AP Poll earlier this week.
It still hasn’t really set in that after a couple of 20-plus loss seasons and last place Pac-12 finishes, the Trojans now sit atop the conference. In the process, they’ve boasted impressive wins over ranked teams in Arizona and Wichita State, in addition to on the road over crosstown rival UCLA.
Finally, USC is being crowned as a basketball school, but let’s not forget that a lot of fans began to doubt Enfield’s ability to lead the Trojans toward the end of last season, some calling him a “fraud” or “Flunk City.”
At a time, the team had lost nine consecutive games in conference, and meanwhile, hundreds of comments flooded USC sports blogs, calling for Enfield’s job and Athletic Director Pat Haden’s as well for hiring him.
“Of course, no sane person would have hired a totally undistinguished coach of what was basically a high school team to head a major D-I program with a top recruiting budget, $40 million new arena, in the middle of [a] basketball recruiting hotbed. But Haden did it anyway,” one comment read.
But look who’s laughing now…
For one, after all of the criticism Haden has taken over the years for his hiring (and firing) of head football coaches, Enfield’s success has to be seen, for the time being, as a tremendous victory for him.
When Haden and I met in October, he described the hiring of Enfield as a “venture capital bet” — a suitable double entendre funny because Enfield also used to be a very successful businessman and financier.
“I felt that in basketball, we could really take a venture capital risk with a guy who was on the rise and I think it, ultimately, will play off,” Haden said.
It took some time, but surely, it has. Most importantly, through thick and thin, Enfield has stayed true to his word and coaching philosophy.
In a sit-down interview with USC professor Jeff Fellenzer back in September 2013, Enfield told students that his team was going to play fun and play fast.
“We will spread the floor in a San Antonio Spurs-like half-court offense and just try to put up 70 plus points a game,” Enfield said. “We will also be pushing the ball in the open court a lot because not enough teams across the country are doing so.”
Fast forward three seasons and USC leads the Pac-12 in scoring offense, averaging over 84 points per game. The team also possesses one of the deadliest transition games in the nation, hurting its opponents in the air with its aerial athleticism at the rim, as well as on the ground via the three-point shot.
Just as good as advertised? I think most USC fans would have to agree based on the product Enfield has put out on the court this season. It’s a team that is not only exciting to watch but one that is also able to pull out victories in close games over durable opponents like it did in the quadruple-overtime thriller against Arizona.
Enfield deserves credit for the improved maturity and development of his players as well. With the exception of standout freshmen Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu, who have played a significant role in taking the Trojans to the next level, the team returned all of its key contributors from last season. Perimeter players like co-captains Julian Jacobs and Jordan McLaughlin and Nevada transfer Katin Reinhardt have all demonstrated tremendous growth and improvement on both ends of the court.
Horton called this aspect of Enfield’s coaching arsenal, too.
“Andy is very offensive-minded, and there is a heavy emphasis placed on player development and one-on-one breakdowns, which is something we hadn’t done in the past,”  Horton said back in August 2013.
The advancement of just about every USC role player, in turn, has produced a talented and team-oriented bunch that provides matchup nightmares for its opponents on a regular basis.
When Haden hired Enfield in April 2013, he did so hoping that Enfield could turn this program around. Enfield’s former assistant in Horton certainly believed that he eventually would, and now that he has … well, we will just have to wait and see.

The No. 2 Trojans tennis team won its first dual match of the season against No. 59 UC Santa Barbara by a close score of 4-3.
Both teams battled back and forth all throughout the matches, with UCSB holding the lead for a majority of the match, until the Women of Troy came through with a strong finish to win.
The Trojans started slowly in doubles, with all three teams falling behind early.
The No. 2 doubles team of Zoë Katz and Jessica Failla were able to win four straight games against the Gaucho’s Melissa Baker and Jaimee Gilbertson after trailing 2-4 to win the first of the three doubles matches.
The top-five, nationally-ranked team of Giuliana Olmos and Gabby Smith fell to UCSB’s 21st ranked doubles team of Palina Dubavets and Stefani Stojic by a score of 3-6 in a tough match where it seemed Dubavets and Stojic were hitting every shot just out of reach of the Olmos and Smith team.
In the decisive match, the Trojans again fell in a tight 4-6 set; this time Lou Adler and Amanda Atanasson soon defeated sophomore Madison Westby and Meredith Xepoleas on court three. This put the Trojans in a 0-1 hole to begin the match, but they were able to regroup before singles play.
USC started with a battle, splitting the first sets 3-3.
Freshman Jessica Failla, playing No. 4 singles in her first career dual match, got the Trojans on the board with a commanding 6-1 final set win after taking an incredibly close first set 7-6, looking past complaints by her opponent Gilbertson about line calls.
Katz lost a tough battle at the No. 5 singles spot, losing 3-6 in the first set.
After fighting off many chances by Atanasson to close out the match, Katz was finally defeated 6-7 in the second set to give the lead back to UCSB.
Westby, ranked 49th in the nation, won a quick first set 6-0, and after losing the second 4-6, broke her opponent’s serve in the first game of the third set and dominated the rest of the way, winning the third set 6-0 to even the total match at 2 apiece.
The Trojans’ captain and highest nationally ranked player No. 42 Olmos gave USC its first lead of the match in the matchup between each team’s top player.
After grinding out the first set 7-5 over Stefani Stojic, Olmos won a second set tiebreaker 7-3 to win the second set 7-6 and clinch her match, giving the Women of Troy a 3-2 lead overall.
Sophomore Gabby Smith was engaged in a back-and-forth match on court two with neither player looking to give up anything.
She lost the first set to Dubavets 5-7 after a late break, then had a late break of her own to take the second set 6-4.
The third set continued the trend, with Dubavets beating Smith 3-6 to secure the match, leading to the court six matchup of Xepoleas and Stephanie Yamada being the decisive match.
Xepoleas lost a close first set 3-6, got up 3-0 quickly in the second and finished off the set with a 6-4 win. All eyes turned to the final set which would decide the victorious team.
After being tied 4-4, Xepoleas was able to secure a break and win the set 6-4, clinching the match for the Trojans in exciting fashion.
The Women of Troy picked up where they left off after their stellar 2015 season, and they hope to continue their winning ways next Friday against Pepperdine at Marks Stadium.
Picked up where they left off, are you serious. 2nd ranked team in the nation playing at home vs. #59 and win only 4 to 3.
This squad is way over-rated for sure. Gallien really had them prepared for mediocrity .

As another year in film and television whizzed by, so did another year of 20 Oscar nominations without a single person of color. In preparation of the cringe-worthy yet unsurprising Hollywood awards ceremony that fails to recognize minority talent, the Twittersphere voiced its outrage with the return of #OscarsSoWhite and Jada Pinkett Smith announced her Oscars boycott, a decision that has drawn considerable criticism. However, it’s important to recognize the lack of diversity in the Oscars does not exist in a vacuum but rather, is part of a bigger, more complex web of barriers for people of color in Hollywood — and that white support for increasing diversity is crucial for real changes to occur.
Some, like director Spike Lee, claim that the Oscars aren’t the core issue. “As I see it,” Lee wrote on Instagram, “the Academy Awards is not where the ‘real’ battle is. It’s in the executive office of the Hollywood studios and TV and cable networks. This is where the gate keepers decide what gets made and what gets jettisoned to ‘turnaround’ or scrap heap.”
He’s right, but he’s also wrong. Studio and network decisions do, indeed, systematically underrepresent minorities. According to a 2015 report by UCLA’s Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies, this is due to overwhelmingly white studio executives — 94 percent of film CEOs and/or chairs and 96 percent of television CEOs and/or chairs, to be exact. So the well-documented problem of diversity in Hollywood does lie in cushy network chairs.
The Oscars face the same problem that studios do: overwhelmingly un-diverse decision makers. Academy voters who choose Oscar nominees are 94 percent white and 77 percent male, according to a 2012 Los Angeles Times study. It’s no coincidence, then, that these voters’ decisions manifest into 99 percent white Best Director winners, 99 percent white Best Actress winners and 91 percent white Best Actor winners from 1927 to 2012. So, just as every other industry that faces diversity problems, many of the snubs come from people in positions of power who — sometimes in an effort to avoid “risk,” as the authors of the UCLA report put it, but also often subconsciously — disenfranchise minority representation.
But his assertion that the Oscars don’t matter is also misguided. As the ultimate industry symbol of artistic achievement, the Oscars’ racial exclusion perpetuates a cycle that discourages minority actors and filmmakers. It sends the message to aspiring minority talent that their time and effort is not welcome in the industry and certainly will not be recognized.
For the few minority actors and filmmakers who are institutionally recognized, however, the industry puts them in a precarious position. Actress Janet Hubert criticized Smith’s boycott in a video, saying, “you are a part of Hollywood, you are part of the system that is unfair to other actors. So get real.” And while she fails to see that Smith’s boycott is intended to empower instead of disenfranchise minority actors, she brings up an interesting and heartbreaking point — surviving as a minority in a white-dominated industry requires being complicit in its injustice. Voicing opposition to an unfair institution could label a struggling actor of color as “entitled” or “hard to work with,” which is why it’s even more crucial now that white actors recognize the importance of supporting minority representation.
The Oscars are just another institution that, stuck in archaic ways reinforced by systemic barriers, needs to reform itself. And to be fair, the statement from Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs that “we need to do more, and better and more quickly” sounds like a genuine commitment to enact much-needed structural changes. But it will be up to viewers everywhere to see if the Academy really will have more diverse members, and whether this body will actually recognize minority actors and filmmakers that have long deserved commendations.
However, even if the Academy fixes its diversity problem, it will be faced with tremendous opposition, and it will still be complicit in a complex web of Hollywood institutions — from film schools, to festivals, to studios, to theaters, to auditions — that is blatantly unfair to minorities. Regardless, as the 2015 UCLA report mentions, increasingly diverse audiences prefer diverse talent. And the unbridled success of minority-studded television shows such as Fresh Off the Boat, Empire, Master of None and How to Get Away with Murder has made this fact apparent over the last year. So to those who say that diversity isn’t appreciated by viewers, that’s not exactly the case — it’s the executives and Academy members that are receiving the criticism that they deserve.
It’s unfortunate that it takes changing demographics — in 2014, the United States became a majority-minority country — to provide enough social pressure to recognize the injustice present in centuries-old institutions like the Oscars. But if collective action can reform the largest and most prestigious artistic phenomenon to finally give all artists a fair shot, what can’t it do?

A recent Delta Gamma recruitment video from the University of Miami, Florida features scores of girls enjoying the Miami sun while attending rooftop pool parties and boating along the coast.
While the girls appear to be having fun, the video has sparked considerable criticism. The majority of the video displayed scenic views and beautiful weather; however, it also featured girls lacking in ethnic and body diversity. It failed to demonstrate scholarly aspects, but successfully portrayed a sexist representation of women and appeared to perpetuate the stereotype of a sorority girl — rich, beautiful and homogenous. The video itself is a poor representation of what a sorority and sisterhood are supposed to embody, and yet it’s a sad fact that much of this representation is exactly what being in a sorority entails.
The video portrays what it could be like to be a Delta Gamma, and shows that if you join this sisterhood, you’re in for a great time. Yet, it lacks depth in many aspects such as academic or professional aspirations. Not once does the video display the girls on their school campus, and consequently nowhere near a classroom or library.
The video also fails to demonstrate their philanthropic values — how they are benefiting and giving back to their university and community. It seems that not only is DG using this video to focus on the trivial and materialistic aspects of sorority life, but it’s also estimated that a grotesque amount of money was spent on the video that could’ve been put toward a charitable cause. The video itself is supposed to have cost anywhere from $200,000 to $400,000, a portion of which could have easily been donated.
The intentions are clear — this sorority knows how to party. However, it also appears that if you join DG, you fit the perfect mold of a beautiful young woman — which is somewhat ridiculous and unrealistic. The video doesn’t demonstrate much diversity, in that a lot of the girls are similar in stature as well as external appearance, with seemingly perfect tans accompanying their bikini-clad bodies. This only further perpetuates, once again, the stereotype and conventionality within greek life.
The video underscores a pattern in many sorority recruitment videos that only show parties, as well as little to no diversity. Just last year, the University of Alabama’s Alpha Phi was also criticized, for demonstrating how, according to one writer,  “it’s all so racially and aesthetically homogeneous and forced, so hyper-feminine, so reductive and objectifying.”
These videos disregard the main purpose of a sorority — to empower other women, make lifelong connections and benefit the surrounding community and campus. DG’s video, on the other hand, is laced with an undertone of elitism. This suggests that if potential new members become a part of this “sisterhood,” then they’re a part of this higher tier house meant only for girls on campus who fit this standard mold of perfection in beauty and in body.
Ultimately, yes, these girls are happy and having a lot fun, and there is nothing wrong with that. But when a video like this surfaces — accumulating more than 300,000 views — people might get the wrong idea and question what exactly joining a sorority will mean for them. Because in all honesty, what is this video promoting besides partying, exclusion and sexism?
Many women are watching, including potential new members and even young girls still in grade school. This may lead to assumptions of what a sorority’s intent really is, leading people to perceive greek life as nothing more than one big party meant for only one type of girl.

Target has collaborated with high-end brands and designers in the past, but its recent partnership with SoulCycle will be its first time teaming up with a fitness company. The boutique fitness chain’s 10-city tour, complete with six free classes a day and a capsule collection of lower-priced Soul-branded apparel at select Target locations, stops by Los Angeles from Feb. 12 to 14.
While it seems all glam and dollar signs, this isn’t just a sign of fitness infiltrating the fashion world — it’s a mark of an increase in commodifying the “active lifestyle” and associating it more closely with the luxury and status that few can afford.
The big question, though, is: what drives people to pay $34 for high-end classes at boutique fitness programs? SoulCycle, with its 45-minute intense candlelit workouts complete with rocking music and stylish gym wear, is one among many that have amassed cultish followings nationwide. Today, joining the ranks of Zumba, hot yoga, Pilates and Crossfit, are companies like Pure Barre, Solidcore and Flywheel that are shaping up many a wallet. Groups like Potomac Pilates price classes at values as high as $40.
Perhaps this fitness frenzy reflects something more profound than skin-deep narcissism. Perhaps SoulCycle is more than just an industry that Target is capitalizing on, and the emerging fitness boutiques don’t just boil down to business and profit.
The reason behind the obsessive culture, inspirational mantras and big dollar signs lies not just with the new body or “active lifestyle” that these programs are selling, but the promise of a community, a sense of belonging — things that resonate deeply with consumers. As SoulCycle’s website says, “SoulCycle doesn’t change bodies, it changes lives.”
While the play on spirituality and personal transformation does sound a little like deceptive marketing, there seems to be some truth to it. After all, in today’s culture, people are more digitally connected yet locally isolated than ever before.
Groups like SoulCycle and CrossFit rush to meet that need. In fact, for some, membership borders on religious experience. In an increasingly secular America, people seem to be turning to “activities and subcultures [to] provide the meaning that in the past, at least as we imagine it, religious communities did,” as The New York Times put it. At Harvard’s School of Divinity, researchers Angie Thurston and Casper ter Kuile conducted a study on spaces other than churches that serve as spiritual communities, finding that “as traditional religion struggles to attract young people, millennials are looking elsewhere with increasing urgency.”
Those places, it seems, include fitness boutiques. One “Soul evangelist,” Nick White, told Thurston and Kuile, “What we share is a passion for personal improvement — be that physical, mental, or emotional — that we express through music, syncopation and shared experiences.”
Programs like SoulCycle create a space for shared, transformative experiences. Clients feel special because they are set apart from others who aren’t investing as much in terms of time, energy, and money. It gives them a tribe to belong to, and the company’s sartorial branding of athleisure, emblazoned with a scarlet bulls-eye and “Soul,” is a part of that experience.
Elements of elitism and the exclusive also come with the higher prices. Ginia Bellafante of The New York Times noted that the rise of high-end gyms “ensured that working out, like drinking coffee, would become another socially tiered experience with occupiers of top tax brackets doing it one way and secretaries and civil servants another — left to leg lifts in front of their televisions or discounted gyms that did not aim to make you feel special.” And naturally, for the why-pay-less customer, the more expensive, the better the quality.
Honestly speaking, getting fit really doesn’t take all that money and merchandise; the bottom line is that these classes bring a sense of privilege and exclusiveness. You don’t really need those $90 yoga pants to look good while running around campus. A pushup doesn’t cost a thing.
But a tough instructor, a $40 down payment, or 50 new cycling enthusiast friends just might give that extra push someone needs to start their soulful journey. Paying to exercise may be a relatively new concept, but people are buying it. To each his own.

Harvard recently decided that a long-held tradition, referring to heads of undergraduate residences as “masters,” would be discontinued. The decision was made by a unanimous vote by the masters of the residences and had been a topic under consideration for “a while.” This was due, in part, to the masters reacting to the concerns of students who were made uncomfortable by the use of a title ostensibly tied to slavery. Similar changes have been demanded at other Ivy League colleges, culminating in a discontinuation of similar titles at Princeton and debate at Yale.
While the word “master” was undoubtedly used at a time when people could be considered property, the use of the term in Harvard’s setting stems from a centuries-old European tradition that has little relation to American slavery. The use of a word so linked to slavery in the United States is unfortunate. The link is, however, anything but intentional. The medieval-era term conveys a very different meaning in the Ivy League’s historical and traditional context than students at those schools infer. The term was traditionally used to mean “teacher,” not to infer ownership. A master in Harvard’s context is charged with taking care of residents and administrative duties. Lack of awareness of historical context and intent is a hallmark of contemporary student movements at universities around the country, and student pressure causes university administrations to make hasty decisions in order to placate demands in the short term.
Student demands like these are important — if an issue is noteworthy enough to elicit outcry among students, it probably deserves careful re-evaluation by university administrators. What is equally important, though, is making a sound argument that is fair to the subject of one’s criticism. That means taking history, symbols and even titles in context and understanding their meaning as defined by those charged with upholding and explaining them. If a student organization makes an impassioned rhetorical argument, but goes out of its way to reinterpret history to fit its narrative, that is an example of historical revisionism. Historical revisionism has no place in the academy and should be vehemently spurned.
For example, Harvard students calling themselves “Royall Must Fall” demanded Harvard Law School’s seal be changed because it “represents and endorses a slaveholding legacy.” It is true that Harvard Law School’s seal is linked to the Royall family, who owned slaves. It is also true that the Royall family was banished from Massachusetts during the Revolutionary War, risking death if they were to return. The land they previously inhabited was left to Harvard in accordance with Isaac Royall Jr.’s will when he died in exile in 1781, and the land was used to create Harvard Law School more than 30 years later in 1817. Harvard Law School then adopted the Royall’s coat-of-arms in recognition of their donation. The fact that this school had a black graduate as early as 1869 named George Lewis Ruffin, who went on to become the first black judge in the Royall’s home state, speaks for itself. Clearly, the claim that Harvard endorses slavery is far more attenuated than some student activists would like to believe that it is.
Instead of primarily targeting real issues that would substantially affect the quality of student life, such as faculty and student diversity and adjunct faculty working conditions, student groups in prominent universities across the country are choosing to wage a poorly supported war on symbols and inconveniences rather than on tangible, mutable policies that have real impact. Attempting to change and reinterpret benign age-old traditions and symbols only serves to stifle opportunities for dialogue. It also serves to tarnish the names of people who, although advanced for their time, do not fit rather Puritan contemporary conceptions of morality.
“Royall Must Fall” claims that “imagery from a slaveholding era has no place” at Harvard. This is a deeply unnerving belief, since it holds that all collegiate traditions, symbols and titles established or practiced before the 13th Amendment’s passage ought to be spurned based solely on their time period of origin. Such an argument does not hold up under even cursory scrutiny, and to acquiesce to it would leave Ivy League schools devoid of their heritage, culture and worst of all, critical dialogue about those topics. This not to say that student outcry and debate over these topics is useless. It is important to acknowledge the flaws of human beings throughout history and to learn from their mistakes. Obscuring the benefits gained from their legacies or changing cherished hallmarks of college culture and history, however, does no one any good.

Los Angeles thrives on foods of different tastes, multiple cultures and one-of-a-kind trends. As we start the new year, several predictions have been made in terms of what will dominate over kale and acai bowls and be deemed most popular. Here are a few fads that you might want to look out for in the coming months. 
As college students, most of us have food apps and take-out menus taking up our tabs because some days, you just want to eat out or simply have no time to cook. Amazon and Uber have even geared their services toward food. Food delivery is on the rise with more restaurants jumping on the bandwagon of offering a meal delivered to their doorstep to compete with other restaurants, make a better profit and satisfy lazy yet hungry customers.

It has finally come to the attention of many restaurants and fast-food chains that customers prefer less chemically induced and healthier foods. Restaurants are beginning to introduce new, healthier options; consequently, this might result in a boost in food prices. Either way, it will be refreshing to eat at a restaurant that has made known that they are striving to free themselves of GMOs and artificial flavors and colors and introduce more natural, holistic ingredients into their dishes.

Seaweed appears to be the new, green superfood sparking interest nationwide. The ocean vegetable, typically consumed by Asian cultures, is said to be packed with a boatload of antioxidants, good fats, iodine and fiber. Will campus food hubs like Seeds and Nekter begin offering seaweed this year? Seaweed smoothie, anyone?

Okay, we live in SoCal and Ebaes is right down the road. We know what ramen is — the rest of the world is just catching up to the phenomenon of the noodle, veggie, broth, fusion of flavors and overall goodness that can be found in a large bowl. It’s a staple in my diet, and I definitely wouldn’t mind seeing the new takes on this favorite, beloved dish.

Pasta is a versatile meal — it’s served with restaurants, easily made at home and prepared many ways, but it’s shockingly on a declining slope — even in Italy. With new carbohydrates like quinoa, barley and chia stepping up to the plate, pasta is on its way out. These days,  vegetables are making up a bigger part of plates these days. A new kitchen gadget I recently picked up is a vegetable spiralizer; it makes noodles out of your veggies! Looks like I’m already on trend for the new year.

Look out for these and a multitude of other food fads in the next few months.

State of the student union · Sampath reflected upon the accomplishments of the student government over the course of last semester and how they reflect her future goals for the University. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Student advocacy and activism was the focus of Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath’s first-ever State of the Student Body address delivered Tuesday evening in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Sampath began the speech by recapping last year’s accomplishments.
“The year 2015 was so significant for our student government and our campus,” Sampath said. “Our advocacy work saw results.”
Sampath thanked student leaders for their work in launching the Campus Climate Resolution, a campaign to resolve diversity and inclusion issues on campus. The resolution was in-step with similar movements at universities across the U.S., spurred on by incidents of discrimination at the University of Missouri.
The address recalled the huge shifts in student engagement, which culminated in several impassioned Senate meetings toward the end of the semester.
“With some of the highest attended Senate meetings in USC history, we saw a tremendous increase in campus engagement on hot-button topics,” Sampath said.
Sampath also thanked senior administrators Provost Michael Quick and Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, who held an impromptu meeting with students leaders in November of last year after protests outside of Bovard Auditorium.
“There are students whose voices aren’t heard due to the disconnect that has existed between our student body and our senior administration,” Sampath said. “In this past year, I believe we were generally able to begin to bridge this gap by elevating the voice of those that have been left in the shadows.” Sampath said.
Sampath returned to the concept of the “invisible Trojan” to highlight disparities in the student experience at USC.
“The invisible Trojan — sexual assault survivors, students living with mental illnesses, transfer students, students from low-income communities, students from the queer community and more are left on the fringes,” Sampath said. “Firmly incorporating these individuals into the forefront of the USC community will bring us closer to the idea of a perfect USC.”
After the address, Senator Giuseppe Robalino asked Sampath about the national attention brought to the university by the advocacy work.
Sampath responded by highlighting the strength of an outspoken student body.
“If we turn a blind eye to [these issues], we are doing an injustice as student leaders,” Sampath said.
Sampath linked the advocacy work at USC to efforts by students across the country to address issues of diversity and inclusion.
“We need people to participate,” Sampath said. “I’m so glad we played our role in a nationwide movement.”

Getting some Vitamin D · Solar paneled umbrellas are placed at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center as part of the iniative to maintain the Campus Cetner’s status as an LEED certified building. – Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
The Ronald Tutor Campus Center installed 10 of 12 new umbrellas in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Plaza over winter break. These new umbrellas are outfitted with solar-powered charging systems.
The umbrellas are part of an initiative on the part of the Environmental Student Assembly explained Olivia Pearson, an ESA member and freshman majoring in environmental engineering.
“One of our members submitted an application for the Green Engagement Fund, which is a fund that gives out grants for the environmental projects of students,” Pearson said. “The solar panels are on the umbrellas in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and near the accounting buildings, and there are power outlets at the base of the umbrella so students can charge their phones and laptops using free energy.”
Five years ago, the Campus Center was recognized as the University’s first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certified building.
According to USC Sustainability, “LEED certification not only focuses on increasing the efficiency and minimizing the waste from buildings but also on the health and well-being of that building’s occupants.”
Currently, the Campus Center has a high solar reflectance index roof and high performance windows to maintain a constant temperature; fluorescent lights that utilize less energy; ultraviolet exhaust hoods that lower the amount of air pollutants; and a food-pulping system that effectively uses food products.
Alexandria Bauer, a freshman majoring in environmental studies, said she’s excited with the strides the University is making toward clean energy.
“I think it’s really great that USC is heading towards the directions of alternative energy,” Bauer said. “It’s a huge step in the right direction, and hopefully this use of solar energy will inspire larger scale uses.”

Dani Byrd, appointed by Provost Michael Quick as interim dean for the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, is continuing  a push for curriculum innovation, integration of research, and strengthened communication among faculty and students. She was appointed after the departure of former Dean Steve Kay on Nov. 30 to assume the role of president of the Scripps Research Institution.
Byrd, a faculty member at USC for 17 years, has served various roles within Dornsife including vice dean for research advancement, vice dean for faculty and research, vice dean for institutional affairs and most recently, executive vice dean. Her field of study focuses primarily on human speech production which involves the use of MRI to observe the vocal tract and how it generates speech.
“My job is to make sure they have all the opportunities to make terrific choices about classes and majors, to lower obstacles to allow for students to chart that educational path,” Byrd said. “While at the same time making sure that we have this enormous array of high-quality teaching in classes available to students so that they have the information they need to seek their educational goals.”
Byrd also said that there are opportunities for Dornsife to integrate programs of study that are thematic and do not necessarily fall under what an academic would traditionally perceive as tied to a specific discipline or department. Byrd explained that the creation of new majors and minors within Dornsife has led to greater convergence among disciplines.
“We’ve been talking about curricular innovation that includes lowering obstacles to programs of study, cleaning up programs that may not be so interesting and offering instead, thematic, novel or interestingly structured new options,” Byrd said. “It involves making sure that we are doing a terrific job teaching those classes, not just offering them and that are students are actively involved in those classes.”
Some of Byrd’s primary concerns as interim dean include increasing student opportunity in internships and research for scholarly experiences through funding by the Student Opportunities for Academic Research and Summer Undergraduate Research Fund programs within Dornsife. Further, she explained that innovating the core undergraduate curriculum includes active communication among students and with faculty members.
“We have to be committed to setting the bar high and continuing all of the progress we’ve benefited from,” Byrd said. “Dornsife is a top college and a top research university in the country and that gives us an opportunity — but even more than that, an obligation — to become better and to tackle both from our students’ perspectives and from our faculty research the toughest challenges that are out there and to prepare our students to become the Trojan Family representatives that are going to go on and lead the way in these very difficult but societally critical problems.”
Byrd received her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in linguistics from Yale University and a doctorate degree from UCLA. She founded the USC Phonetics Laboratory in 1998. Four years later, she became an associate professor of linguistics at USC and since then has continued to advance research.
Byrd has received several awards in recognition of her work in linguistics, such as a fellowship and the R. Bruce Lindsay Award granted by the Acoustical Society of America and the USC Dornsife Dean’s Award for Distinguished Service in 2012. Additionally, Byrd has worked as an editorial board member for the Journal of the International Phonetic Association.
In discussing different ways to engage students in research, Byrd highlighted the Bridge Institution and the Korean Studies Institute as epicenters for vast opportunities in undergraduate research.
“We’ve developed, over the past few decades, some terrific research centers and institutes, and for me, it’s so important to highlight that they are at an educational institution and that they have a special role to play in the educational mission,” Byrd said.
Provost Michael Quick and Dean Avishai Sadan of the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry will head the 12-member advisory search committee to select and appoint the next permanent dean of Dornsife.

Quick and to the point · In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Quick discussed his background and planned goals for the University. – Courtesy of USC News
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Provost Michael Quick emphasized the importance of including student response when creating initiatives for the University. He plans to measure the effectiveness of these newly developed programs aimed at student access and opportunity.
Daily Trojan: As a first-generation college student yourself, do you plan to initiate more programs or encourage more communication at USC concerning first-generation college students?
Michael Quick: Yeah absolutely, not even just because I was a first generation, but it does give you a nice perspective … and we have a large number, 15 percent of any class or more are first generation college-goers. And especially at a big place like USC … I’m so proud [of] the diversity USC has. That often means we’re going to have more people from interesting backgrounds, that means we’re going to have more programs in place that allow for things to happen. I know, for example, that Professor George Sanchez in [the] Dornsife [College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences] is setting up a big program with support of the University, a program about first-generation college-goers. … I’m looking forward to meeting with a number of people and various schools because you know it’s different at every school.
DT: How has your extensive science background aided you as USC’s provost and more specifically within your goals for environmental sustainability?
MQ:  Being a scientist, how do we think about the world and our understanding of these important topics? And then, how do we implement these kinds of plans? You’re trained as a scientist to problem solve. You know there’s a problem out there you can’t figure out how it works, and you have to problem solve and come up with hypotheses. You have to figure out: if I do this, what is the likely outcome? Then, you actually run the experiment and see what the outcome is.
This is a larger question not only around something like sustainability, but in everything we do, and this comes from my science [background]. I want us to be data-driven. I want to not just do something because it’s the fashionable thing. I want to see if has real outcome and real impact. You know, that’s my training as a scientist. You put a program into place — you asked about the first generation programs. Let’s do something for first-generation college-goers, but let’s assess how they are doing before the program, and how they are after. Let’s see if there is improvement, let’s be data-driven as we make our decisions. When we were talking about some of the sustainability stuff and putting those things into place, it really became a question of, “what are things we can put into place that can have impact and how are we going to measure that impact so that it happens?” And that came from my scientific background.
DT: Last April, you said you wanted to increase your involvement with the student community. How are you planning to do so?
MQ: I’ve really tried to keep the door open. I’ve been meeting a lot of students. All they have to do is email me, and I’m happy to get together with them. … We’re going to have forums where I will have more opportunities to interact with different students. I’d like to do more informal things. I’ve been talking with the student government and other groups. … I am more than happy to get out there and meet people in informal settings and try to better understand what concerns them, what they like or don’t like about where the University is going — to get a real flavor for what we’re doing. I teach a class in the spring every year because I love to continue to get input, to not only teach students, but also get input from other students. It’s a neuroscience class. That’s one way I do it. But I really am open to interacting with more students and seeing more students. I want to be completely accessible.
DT: Last April you said a major goal was to fix the “big problems of the 21st century.” Based on the recent resolutions to increase environmental sustainability and decrease campus racial bias, what other “big problems” need more discussion?
MQ: Yeah, so those are two great ones, I’ve been using the phrase, ‘wicked problem’ — it has kind of resonated with people. I like that because these are big, in some ways, somewhat intractable problems. They are not really like easy solutions because sometimes you know if you work on this part of the problem, you create more problems over here; so that’s what makes them ‘wicked.’
When I think about — and  this is something we’re doing, a strategic plan right now for the University — in thinking about in the next five years or 10 years or whatever, what are we going to tackle as a university? I think there are two pieces to that. The first part of wicked problems is what are the wicked problems, and I think that’s an easier list to make … the second part though is the tougher one, which is to ask at USC — we want USC to be a leader, we don’t just want to partially tackle this problem — what’s the wicked problem USC wants to solve … and that’s what we’re going to try and figure out in talking to people over the next several months. But to give you one possibility, and one that we’re actually we’re really suited to do, is around the concept of aging. Aging is becoming a huge issue … and it becomes a question of aging and healthy aging and unhealthy aging, and if you have to think about people are living longer, but are they living well? […] It’s a social question, it’s an economic question, a question of social justice and social welfare, a question of the arts and the humanities. How do we engage people throughout their lives in being human? That’s a big problem, and it’s a big, expensive problem … that’s one we could tackle in a big way and it would have a huge lasting impact on the world. Whether we choose aging or not, I don’t know — I’m just giving that as an example — but that’s the kind of thing [where] we really want to say, “USC is working on these big hard problems and we’re making [a] huge contribution.”
DT: In November, USG presented the campus climate resolution asking for $100 million to fund additional resources to increase awareness of the present racial bias at the university. How can the resolution inform students unaware of these issues?
MQ: The resolution came out and I came out with my sort of immediate response, and now we’re working through it. That’s what I love about universities is you get a lot of smart people having these conversations, you come up with a really good idea of what we’re doing. All these are in place: we have the diversity committee that is having conversations, inviting people in, and getting voices. … I’ve got a meeting coming up very [soon] with the diversity liaison for every school, so that’s about to happen. So things are in motion and the conversations are going on. I think a lot of that is going really well. … What I love about what the students have been doing here — and the faculty is taking really seriously — is engaging in really intelligent conversations about how do you put this in place so that it’s going to last a long time and really have [an] impact. Then it gets back to, for me, data driven. … We can always call for this or that, but at the end of the day, is it having an impact? Whatever we put in place I want to make sure we can measure we are having an impact.

Calling all gym rats, athletes and fitness enthusiasts — the next time you want your quick and easy protein fix, check out SuppNow.
Founded by USC alumnus Armand Farrokh and his business partner Nick Cegelski, a senior majoring in public relations, SuppNow offers vending machines filled with nutritional supplements in local gyms and health centers and was recently named “Top Undergraduate Venture” by the University.
“I came up with the idea when I was just getting back into wrestling,” Farrokh said. “I realized that every time I wanted to buy supplements, I either paid too much in a store or dealt with shipping headaches online.”
In order to combat both of these drawbacks, Farrokh wanted to create an easier and more affordable way to purchase top supplement brands.
With SuppNow kiosks, he believed he could offer supplements that beat online retail prices while having the convenience of being available right inside a gym.
Farrokh first pitched SuppNow during the entrepreneurship course at USC, BAEP 451: The Management of New Enterprises.
After receiving positive feedback, he continued his business plan in BAEP 452: Feasibility Analysis and invited USC Club Wrestling teammate Nick Cegelski on board.
The duo got straight to work by calling gyms, negotiating with manufacturers and pitching nonstop.
According to Cegelski, the ideal gyms for launching SuppNow’s vending machines were ones with enough traffic and trainers to attract a large number of customers.
“We implemented a system that gives trainers free supplements when they refer people to our machines,” Cegelski said. “There are no quotas to fill, and it’s not pushy at all. In fact, everyone is happy because trainers get free products, clients get steered toward reliable supplements and of course, we get more customers and PR.”
SuppNow officially launched its first kiosk in May 2015 at Hollywood Gym.
Since then, they have expanded to L.A. Fitness gyms in Playa Vista, Fountain Valley and Irvine.
“When someone walks up to one of our machines, it’s like consulting a personal nutritionist,” Cegelski said. “Each machine has a 32-inch interactive touch screen that includes prices, pictures and reviews of top supplement brands to help guide you in the right direction.”
SuppNow also employs promoters to help spread the word about its business.
Emma Lev, a senior majoring in theater, has worked the events at several gyms where SuppNow is located.
“As a promo rep, I frequently answer questions about the products in the machines and how they may be beneficial to incorporate in one’s routine,” Lev said. “I also work with trainers at the gyms to get them excited, and I strategize with the rest of the team to come up with Instagram posts and other ways to develop effective customer engagement strategies.”
With the startup’s increasing popularity as well as a recent $2,500 award from the USC Stevens Center for Innovation, Cegelski and Farrokh are optimistic about the future.
Currently, the duo is working on a makeover of SuppNow and planning some big visual changes to the interface to make the machine more personable.
“We’re launching a franchising model so we can rapidly expand throughout the country with minimal costs,” Farrokh said.
“We’ll expand our operations beyond Southern California and shoot for hundreds of locations, both SuppNow-owned and franchise, Farokh said. “It’s our dream to become the Redbox of supplements, and that’s what gets us up every morning to charge onward.”
