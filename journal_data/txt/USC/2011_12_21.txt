The USC women’s basketball team snapped a two-game losing streak after defeating Pepperdine 75-71 in overtime on Wednesday. USC is 18-0 all time against Pepperdine, with the series dating back to 1977.
Pepperdine shot eight 3-pointers in the first half, giving the Waves a 42-35 lead at halftime over the Women of Troy. In the second half, the USC defense held the Waves’ Lauren Bell to four points. Bell put up 18 points in the first half for the Waves. The USC offense was facilitated by scores from senior guard Ashley Corral, junior guard Stefanie Gilbreath, senior guard Briana Gilbreath and sophomore forward Cassie Harberts.
With the USC offense wavering in the second half, the Women of Troy came up short for a whole four minutes. A three-point play by Harberts gave the Trojans a 56-55 lead with seven minutes left in the game.
Tied at 63 with less than two minutes remaining, Briana Gilbreath’s go-ahead attempt rolled off the rim to Pepperdine the ball with 11.7 seconds to go. A failed attempt by the Waves gave USC the ball with 4.6 seconds left in regulation. Freshman guard Ariya Crook sought to win the game for the Women of Troy but came up short, sending the game into overtime.
Pepperdine was the first to strike in overtime. Corral answered back with a three. The Women of Troy maintained at least a two-point lead for the remainder of overtime. USC sealed the victory after a missed three by Pepperdine was rebounded by Harberts.
Harberts led the Women of Troy with 23 points and Stefanie Gilbreath added 10 points. Junior forward Christina Marinacci had 12 rebounds and Briana Gilbreath posted a career-high nine assists.
The Women of Troy endured close losses on the road to Arkansas State (58-56) and reigning national champion Texas A&M (71-70). USC returns home Dec. 29 to host Stanford at the Galen Center at 7 p.m. in the Pac-12 conference opener, followed by a New Year’s Eve home matchup at 11 a.m. against California.

USC junior safety T.J. McDonald announced Wednesday that he will return to school for his senior season, forgoing the opportunity to declare for the NFL draft.
McDonald, a first-team All-Pac-12 selection in 2011, had been projected as a possible second round pick in next April’s draft had he chose to declare.
“We have an opportunity to do something great,” McDonald said in a video released by the school. “That opportunity doesn’t come around very often. I want to finish things out and be a part of something great.”
A second-year starter for the Trojans last season, McDonald finished with 69 tackles and three interceptions, making the Sporting News and Pro Football Weekly All-American first teams. McDonald and his father, Tim, became the first father-son tandem in school history to be named All-Americans. Tim McDonald was an All-American for USC in 1985 and 1986 before a 13-year NFL career with the St. Louis/Phoenix Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers.
In 2010, T.J. McDonald also led the team in tackles with 89.
“We’re obviously very excited about T.J.’s decision to return next year,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said in a statement. “He’ll be a leading candidate for the Thorpe Award in 2012 and he has a chance to be a two-time All-American. Plus he will captain our team for a second straight year and graduate.”
Fellow juniors left tackle Matt Kalil and defensive end Nick Perry have announced intentions to declare for the draft, leaving quarterback Matt Barkley as the only prominent USC junior weighing whether to remain in school or turn pro.
Barkley has until Jan. 15 to declare for the draft.
