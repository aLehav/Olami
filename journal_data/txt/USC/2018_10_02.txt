Senior driver Zach D’Sa touted 26 goals in his junior season. He also scored twice in the MPSF and NCAA semifinal games. (Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan)
As the only senior on this year’s No. 1 ranked men’s water polo team, driver Zach D’Sa uses his experiences to mentor his younger teammates as they seek another run at the NCAA championship.
Born to a family of swimmers, D’Sa was introduced to the pool when he was only three months old. His water polo career began at age seven, with inspiration from his family.
“My brother was suggested by his swim coach to play water polo and I thought, ‘I’ll try it too!’” D’Sa said. “Once I tried it, I’ve loved it ever since.”
D’Sa’s passion for the game continued at Wilson High, where he achieved numerous honors including league Player of the Year. He also was a standout for his club team, earning the distinction of Long Beach Century Club Player of the Year. D’Sa credits his former coach, Robert Lynn, for helping him develop a deeper knowledge of the game during his high school years.
“[Lynn] taught me almost everything I know,” D’Sa said. “He played in the Olympics, he played here at USC, so I wanted to follow his route my entire life.”
Despite the mentorship of such influential coaches, D’Sa’s transition from playing water polo in high school to playing for one of the best water polo teams in the nation was difficult at first. He wasn’t accustomed to the team’s style of play, as his past clubs had never expected him to run plays.
D’Sa gained valuable experience as soon as his freshman year, appearing on the Trojans’ NCAA tournament roster in 2015. His game has improved each season. Although he scored 10 goals in his freshman season, he doubled this output as a sophomore and achieved a personal best 26 goals as a junior. This season, D’Sa has already posted 16 goals in 12 games.
“I think I’ve gotten a lot smarter and I’ve been able to read the game a lot better,” D’Sa said. “When I was first starting out, I talked to a lot of the older guys to learn from them because they knew the system better than me. Now I’m that older guy, so I have to pass down the knowledge.”
Taking on the role of team captain has given D’Sa many opportunities to share this knowledge. While his role in the pool is the same, he speaks up more often at meetings and games. During game time, D’Sa is nearly as vocal as the goalkeeper in pointing out opponents and situations that his teammates might not be able to see themselves.
However, his duties as captain are not confined to a single meeting or play-by-play situation.
He leads his teammates in the pursuit of a loftier goal: winning an NCAA championship. After three straight championship losses, D’Sa hopes for a victory in the final game in last season as a Trojan.
“I’ve definitely learned a lot from playing in three championships,” D’Sa said. “It’s really hardened me losing all three of them. But I like using my experience to teach these guys what it takes to get there, and I think I know what it should take for us to bring one back to ‘SC this year.”
The championship would be an important final milestone for D’Sa, who does not plan to continue his water polo career after college. Instead, his focus will be on academics; he intends to pursue occupational therapy in graduate school after graduating with a Human Biology degree.
“It’s weird how fast time flew and how I’m the old guy on the team,” D’Sa said. “I’m going to miss being with the team. The coaches have been great, they’ve taught me a lot. It’s going to be a huge bummer not being here anymore.”
D’Sa is excited for the rest of the season, and maintains high expectations for himself and his teammates. After a memorable come-from-behind win against Cal in the NCAA semifinals last season, he and the other veteran players have entered the 2018 season with confidence, demonstrated by their perfect record through 12 games.
“Our goal is to keep winning, keep playing together as a team, keep playing as a unit,” D’Sa said.

Another weekend of college football has come and gone and, as usual, there is plenty of chaos and intrigue. Michigan and Clemson narrowly escaped upsets, West Virginia continues to race up the polls after a ranked road win, Ohio State topped Penn State in a wild comeback … and the Pac-12 continues to muddle on as a relative afterthought.
While the rest of the Power 5 conferences, and even group of five teams like UCF, strengthen title bids and draw huge national audiences, the Pac-12’s apparent playoff favorite, Stanford, was blown out by Notre Dame to the tune of a 38-17 loss. The Pac-12 left the diminished viewing audience unimpressed at best, after a top-10 matchup that played second fiddle to the contest in Happy Valley.
In a year where other Pac-12 playoff hopefuls such as Washington and USC have also fallen short to elite talent in nationally broadcasted games, it is an especially disappointing result for the “conference of champions.” For a conference that saw all but one team lose during the 2017 bowl season, however, this is a dangerous, unforgivable trend.
As long as the Pac-12 elite fail to step up against premiere nonconference opponents, the conference will continue to extend its streak of seasons without a team in the College Football Playoff. Additionally, these teams will continue to get less quality air time on Saturdays.
Outside of the Stanford game, the other conference matchups were either restricted to the regional Pac-12 Network or relegated to the “after dark” timeslots, which are seldom viewed by compelling national audiences. 
Take, for example, the Cal and Oregon game. Although it is possibly as compelling a matchup as the earlier West Virginia-Texas Tech game, due to its 10 p.m. EDT start time, it got nowhere near the same audience. 
This game was played in tandem with what barely passed as a football game between the Trojans and Wildcats, an utterly forgettable late night offering for the West Coast. In a contest filled with penalties, bad turnovers and a general lack of execution on both sides, the USC-Arizona game is all someone needs to see to understand what separates Pac-12 blue chip programs from those everywhere else in the country. As a general rule, their games are often worse.
To a certain degree, the Pac-12 has unavoidable problems due to its location and later time zones. At the end of the day, some games will have to be played while the rest of the nation sleeps. With that said, the conference still can and should do a better job marketing their best matchups. In fact, it should look no further than last week’s game between Stanford and Oregon.
While the conference certainly benefited from the game being selected for ESPN College Gameday, they also capitalized on a nationally appealing timeslot. Playing at 5 p.m. PDT, a highly competitive matchup between the Cardinal and Ducks was a great look for the conference, in spite of the expected lapses in judgment by the referees. This literally drove the stock of the conference up as both teams managed to climb in the polls following the game.
In order to maintain pace with other Power 5 conferences, the Pac-12 needs to find ways, like this, to better showcase their own games. While teams such as Washington, Stanford and USC also need to hold up their end of the bargain by competing with and defeating elite non-conference squads, there is much that the Pac-12 can do to help market their own schools.
Luckily for the Pac-12, there are still some very appealing in-conference competitions remaining in this season. With Washington playing the Ducks in Eugene, Colorado traveling to Seattle to play the Huskies and USC hosting Notre Dame on the last week of the season, there is plenty of opportunity for the Pac-12 to get back into the national spotlight.
Until the conference can find a way to more consistently keep its teams in the limelight and out of the graveyard hour, the blue chips of the Midwest and East Coast will continue to dominate ratings, dominate recruiting and, in turn, dominate teams up and down the West Coast.

The women’s volleyball team returned from its weekend on the road with one win, losing in three straight sets to No. 2 Stanford on Friday and squeezing out a four-set victory over Cal on Sunday. 
The bout against Stanford proved to be a tough one for the Trojans, who had been riding a five-game win streak coming into the match. Their opponents, armed with bigger players, more consistent passing percentages and a dominant frontline, rebutted by handing USC its fifth consecutive Stanford loss. 
The Women of Troy put up an outstanding effort in the first and second sets, tying their opponents 12 times with a hard serving game. On multiple occasions, Stanford pulled ahead by stringing together 4 to 5 consecutive points. 
“Almost every match is a serve and pass match. You need to win the serve and pass battle to have a chance, especially against a team as big and physical as Stanford … it was the same deal with BYU,” head coach Brent Crouch said. “When you have a 6-foot, 6-foot-1-inch blocker facing an even taller hitter that can jump, it’s always an uphill battle.” 
Stanford junior Kathryn Plummer, an outside hitter who stands at 6-foot-5 and was voted the American Volleyball Coaches Association National Player of the Year in 2017, was a tough obstacle. Crouch said he holds a high amount of respect for Plummer and expressed confidence in her ability to snatch the title again this year. 
“[Plummer] is a great server, a great blocker and a next-level hitter,” Crouch said. “I haven’t seen anybody in the same galaxy as her this year. Not even close.” 
Plummer contributed a total of nine digs and 18 kills, including the game ending spike. On the other hand, the Trojans’ three outside hitters — juniors Emily Baptista and Khalia Lanier and sophomore Brooke Botkin — had an uncharacteristically quiet match; none broke into the double digits for kills. Meanwhile, freshman setter Raquel Lázaro and senior libero Victoria Garrick combined for a total of 16 digs and 30 assists. 
The Women of Troy fared much better against Cal. The Golden Bears took the first set, due to a flat Trojan defense and Berkeley’s sophomore outside hitter Mima Merkovich. USC claimed the next two frames thanks to Lanier, who had 26 total kills. Five were earned in succession, which quickly turned the third set in USC’s favor. Garrick and Lázaro continued to impress by leading the game in digs (18 and 17, respectively). The freshman setter was even able to pick up 52 assists, marking her seventh season double-double. 
The Trojans lost their momentum again in the initial stages of the fourth, nearly losing the set twice. Crouch noted one of many shifts in Cal’s game plan, which involved setting more to the right in order to increase pressure on Lanier and Botkin. 
“We did not handle that well,” Crouch said. “Our hitters on both sides need to do a much better job in those situations and it’s something we’ll look at during practice.” 
USC’s match points were also heavily contested. During her third attempt, Botkin landed her 20th kill of the match to end it all. USC now boasts seven back-to-back wins against Cal. 
The Trojans will return to Galen Center for the next four matches of the season. 
Garrick, who assembled a commendable weekend performance, is eager to put on a show for the home crowd. However, she acknowledges that the team must mitigate certain weaknesses in order to do well against high-caliber teams. 
“It comes down to being gritty and doing anything to keep that ball off the ground,” Garrick said. “But in general, I’m excited for us to get back in the gym this week.” 
USC will face off against Oregon State on Thursday and Oregon on Sunday.

Sophomore driver Marko Vavic leads the Trojans in goals with 39 recorded in 16 games. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
No. 1 men’s water polo followed its dominant performance at the Lancer Joust this past weekend with a commanding 16-2 victory over No. 5 UC Santa Barbara on Sunday.
The weekend kicked off with a match against tournament host Cal Baptist, which put up early points before USC scored 4 consecutive goals to gain a 7-2 advantage. Aided by seven saves from freshman keeper Nic Porter, the Trojans extended their lead in the second half, besting the Lancers 15-6.
In USC’s second game of the invite against La Verne, the Trojans asserted control over the game from the opening whistle, as six different Trojans buried goals in just over four minutes. Drivers senior Zach D’Sa, sophomore Marko Vavic and redshirt sophomore utility Luka Karaman topped the score sheet with hat tricks, propelling the Trojans to a 28-4 victory over the Leopards.
On Saturday, the Men of Troy concluded their strong performance at the Lancer Joust with victories against Concordia and Redlands. After scoring the first 10 goals of the game, the Trojans ended with an 18-5 advantage against Concordia. With redshirt freshman keeper Matt Moran-Flores in the cage, the USC defense secured a shutout against Redlands with a final score of 14-0. 
After their successful campaign in Riverside, the Trojans returned home to face No. 5 UC Santa Barbara. USC defeated the Gauchos 10-3 in tournament play earlier this season. 
“Last time [USC played Santa Barbara], it was more of a tournament setting, so we knew they would be a tougher opponent,” Vavic said. “But this time we really locked in all weekend for them.  We were training for them before our other games [on Friday and Saturday].”
Sunday’s scoring began with a power play, during which freshman driver Hannes Daube netted a goal for the Trojans. 
USC responded to the Gauchos’ offensive pressure by putting up 3 more goals by the end of the first period. The Trojans’ momentum continued throughout the second period, including 2 goals and a set-up by Daube to put the Trojans up 8-1. Redshirt junior driver Daniel Leong blocked a UCSB 6-on-5 attack, which the Trojans then turned around for a counterattack goal.
After posting a 10-1 halftime lead, the Trojans started the third period with a bang as Daube’s interception led to Vavic’s 3rd goal of the match. The Men of Troy boasted 11 consecutive scores before the Gauchos broke their silence at the end of the third, scoring on a 6-on-5.
Porter entered the game in the fourth quarter, supplementing Krutonog’s 12 saves with five of his own. In the final frame, the Trojans scored 2 more goals and shut out UCSB to close out a 16-2 victory.
“We learned to put away our high-percentage opportunities,” Vavic said. “Over the weekend, we had a lot of 1-on-1s, 2-on-1s. In the big games you have to finish those.”
The Trojans will head to Palo Alto to take on Stanford on Saturday before returning for a home match against San Jose State on Sunday.

Directed by Jeremy Saulnier and based on the book by William Giraldi, “Hold the Dark” follows a murder mystery set in the Alaskan wilderness. The film, starring Jeffrey Wright and Alexander Skarsgård, was released Friday. (Photo from IMDb)
Legendary director Alfred Hitchcock famously illustrated the power of suspense by imagining a scenario in which a ticking bomb, unbeknownst to the diegetic characters, was set to explode in 15 minutes during a “very innocent little chat.” 
In Jeremy Saulnier’s “Hold the Dark,” this concept of tension-building and anxiety is evoked in a confrontation between police chief Donald Marium (James Badge Dale) and a resident of an Alaskan village (Julian Black Antelope) as they exchange words over a loaded gun that could fire at any second. This scene is only one of few noteworthy moments in the thriller, an  ultimately shallow and confusing two-hour experience.
In the Netflix original film, a pack of wolves kidnaps 6-year-old Bailey Sloane (Beckham Crawford). His mother, Medora (Riley Keough), hires wolf expert Russell Core (Jeffrey Wright) to hunt down the pack, which has already killed three children. However, Medora’s involvement in the abduction soon unravels and affects everyone involved with the case, including Vernon Sloane (Alexander Skarsgård), a father seeking vengeance for his son’s disappearance.
With this intriguing premise, “Hold the Dark” could have been a tightly focused thriller that used dramatic filmmaking techniques to tell a dangerous “man vs. wild” story. Instead, Saulnier delivered a dull and convoluted experience. 
“Hold the Dark” sets itself up to be brutal and mysterious, but Saulnier’s tendency to reveal new information at inopportune moments prevents potentially memorable scenes from being impactful. When Bailey goes missing, the movie fails to capitalize on the mystery of other potential threats by blatantly revealing the culprit, the wolf pack. 
The actors undersell the severity of the characters’ ordeals, as most of them provide stoic performances. 
Keough as Medora failed to convey sufficient distress when Bailey was kidnapped, especially when the film later reveals that she was involved with the crime. 
Skarsgård’s performance especially hurts the film; his monotony fails to set him up as a well-defined adversary and renders the central conflict nonexistent at times. 
In a flashback scene, Vernon tells Bailey his reasons for killing people: “To protect what you love and what you need.” 
Although this sentiment introduces themes about revenge’s corrupting influence on righteous men, the film represses Vernon’s character development; it fails to make his transformation from empathetic to cold-blooded more sudden and sharp by not showing more tender moments.
For example, Vernon’s connection with Bailey amounts to little more than a conversation about murder and only reveals Vernon’s violent personality, masking the heartfelt relationship he had with his son.
Where Saulnier falters in developing character and conflict, however, he finds success in setting the scene. Viewers can practically feel the bleakness of the Alaskan wilderness, as they can hear Core’s shoes crunching in the snow as frost crystallizes on his beard.
As a whole, “Hold the Dark” is underwhelming. It has the makings of a riveting Western, and even stylistically challenges the genre by being set in the snow-capped Alaskan frontier. The forgettable movie has an intriguing premise that is ultimately weighed down by vapid characters and vague plot points.
At the very least, it is assuring that Saulnier wants to introduce the mood from his more strangely conceived films, like “Green Room,” to a wider audience. While his attempt to balance mainstream appeal and artistic integrity is certainly commendable, “Hold the Dark” does not represent these admirable efforts.

Shane Dawson’s newest eight-part docu-drama “The Mind of Jake Paul” has taken the internet by storm in this past week. In addition to commentary on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing and moth and lamp memes, my Twitter feed has been flooded with hype surrounding Dawson’s new series — and for good reason. 
Dawson, often thought of as one of the “grandfathers” of YouTube, is known for conspiracy theory videos, challenges, weird products, tests and skits, content that has fluctuated in popularity among his 17 million subscribers. However, in the past few months, Dawson has revitalized his 13-year-old channel by creating exposés on Jeffree Star and Tana Mongeau’s catastrophic “Tanacon,” with each video garnering over 10 million views. Digging into the life of the infamous Jake Paul might just be his most successful act yet.
To try and explain why Paul is such an interesting choice of subject could be reserved for a column of its own, so I’ll keep it simple. In a snapshot, Paul is a 21-year-old influencer who started on Vine (R.I.P.) and has now amassed over 17 million subscribers on YouTube. He lives with a group of other influencers known as “Team 10” in a house they rent for $17,500 a month, where Paul is known to make crazy challenge videos — including lighting things on fire, bringing lions into his front yard, nearly getting hit by cars and other shenanigans. Paul’s risky actions have frequently put himself and members of Team 10 in harm’s way, and his lack of concern has led some to accuse Paul of being a sociopath. Also, remember how YouTuber Logan Paul kicked off 2018 internet controversies by filming a dead body inside of Japan’s Suicide Forest? Yeah, this is his younger brother.
Some may question how Dawson’s video can be so significant. After all, with 300 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, it’s expected that Dawson’s video would just get lost among those of every other narcissistic internet personality clamoring for attention.
Dawson’s series, however, is more than a mere collection of videos exposing controversial YouTubers. Since pioneering what it means to have a full-time career as a YouTuber, Dawson’s content has been pivotal in shaping the culture of YouTube itself and also influencing how users have created content. As YouTube has grown, so has the range of content — alongside an exponential rise in production value. Dawson’s docu-dramas capitalize on both unique subjects and quality content, highlighting his mastery of content creation while establishing new media platforms like YouTube as legitimate sources for real content — not just meme videos.
Essentially, Dawson has created a new genre of internet content that has further blurred the line between traditional and new media. This, my fellow internet addicts, is huge. There’s always been a professional divide between the two media, with traditional forms like film and television considered “the real deal” and new media like YouTube considered “introductory.” But that divide is now under serious scrutiny. 
Granted, I recognize some may disagree with me about the professionalism of YouTube given that Dawson does not cover hard-hitting, real-world news. I contend, though, that Dawson investing as many hours and resources as he has creating these docu-dramas demonstrates that YouTube deserves to be discussed critically. As an undergraduate journalism student, I see Dawson’s docu-dramas and his aim to expose these YouTubers in an objective light as a new sector of investigative journalism. This will be fascinating to watch evolve as other content creators inevitably incorporate Dawson’s ideas into their own content.
Still, it’s a bit of a stretch to call Dawson’s content “journalism.” True, Dawson has already received acclaim for his series on Paul in accordance with his attempt to face his challenging subject with an open mind. In the second installment, “The Dark Side of Jake Paul,” Dawson interviews psychologist and YouTuber Kati Morton about sociopaths, ultimately asking if certain YouTubers, specifically Paul, are sociopaths. Critics have pointed out that the horror-like editing style surrounding Morton’s interview lacks sensitivity and stigmatizes sociopathy, a very real mental illness that, according to the video, affects approximately one in 25 people. In response, Dawson tweeted that he was thankful for the criticism and now aims to make the conversation better and less dramatized. It’s a step in the right direction, but clearly there are still many more leaps to be taken before content like Dawson’s docu-dramas are legitimized as investigative journalism.
Nonetheless, Dawson is one of the most genuine, innovative content creators out there. His ability to be transparent with his loyal audience, receive criticism well and adapt his content as needed has permitted him to stay relevant over the years, which is increasingly difficult given the behemoth YouTube has become. As a long time Shane Dawson fan (though I probably should not have been watching his videos when I was 11), I applaud his continued efforts to redefine an industry that typically relies on shallow clickbait and ephemeral trends to go viral and make bank. It’s extremely hard to create something fresh and real in this greedy online environment, but Dawson has done just that.

Lil Wayne released his long-awaited record “Tha Carter V” on Sept. 28. The record is the fifth installment of the Carter franchise, following “Tha Carter IV,” which was released in 2011. (Photo courtesy of Young Money Records)
Weezy, Tunechi, Lil Wayne — Dwayne Carter has gone by many different names. His most prominent may be Tha Carter, named for the series of records that helped Lil Wayne rise to fame, featuring smash singles like “Go DJ,” “A Milli” and “Blunt Blowin’.” His impressive repertoire solidifies his placement on the list of all-time hip-hop greats, but Wayne’s reputation is also what made the seven-year wait for the fifth installment of his “Tha Carter” series so tiresome for fans. 
Lil Wayne finally ended the wait last Friday with the release of 23-track LP “Tha Carter V.” The sweeping record takes listeners down memory lane as the Young Money founder replicates past styles, flows and production tropes. While it is undeniably drawn out with many forgettable tracks, “Tha Carter V” is far from disappointing.
The best moments on the album come in Lil Wayne’s deep dive into his own consciousness, which is most prevalent on tracks like “Dedicate,” “Mona Lisa” and closer “Let It All Work Out.” “Dedicate” brings back classic Lil Wayne production, opening with the line, “If it wasn’t for Wayne, it wouldn’t be.” The track showcases the seasoned rapper’s ability to present substantive lyrics while maintaining a killer flow. This trend continues on the record’s winning track, “Mona Lisa.” The Kendrick Lamar feature showcases both rappers’ storytelling abilities, as they tell the tale of a surreptitious woman who frames her boyfriend for robbery, using Mona Lisa’s ambiguous smile as the central metaphor. 
Album closer “Let It All Work Out” shows Lil Wayne reminiscing on one of the darkest points of his life — his struggle with depression and subsequent suicide attempt. The message of the song, however, is positive, as Lil Wayne embraces the power of “[letting] it all work out.” Another highlight of the record is “Dope N-ggaz,” which features Snoop Dogg. The track is a strong ‘90s throwback effort, made credible by Snoop’s irrefutable swagger. 
If “Tha Carter V” was shortened to its 14 strongest tracks, the record would have been more cohesive. Many of the songs on the latter half of the album, such as “Used 2” and “Demons,” are instantly forgettable and wholly unnecessary in the context of the entire album. Wayne’s decision to cram the record with so 
many tracks is excessive, and it is also a powerful indicator of how records are now made and packaged in the streaming era. However, this does not excuse Lil Wayne or any other artist from adding hollow fillers to an already bloated record. 
Lil Wayne’s twelfth LP also shines in its vulnerable moments, particularly on tracks like “Mess” and “What About Me.” These intimate moments are telling of Lil Wayne’s personal life, as he shares details about both romantic encounters and loneliness.  
“Tha Carter V” sufficiently overcomes the drama its release faced for nearly a decade. While the record does not send Lil Wayne off on the highest note, it delivers a solid, nostalgic listening experience for fans of the great Louisiana rapper.

Oct. 8 will mark the first annual Indigenous Peoples’ Day in the city of Los Angeles, after the city council voted to rename Columbus Day last year. This day of recognition should encourage us as students to pause and think about how we are serving our Native American peers. 
In 2008, the National Center for Education Statistics reported that the number of Native American and Alaska Native people enrolled in U.S. colleges doubled between 1976 and 2006, reaching 1 percent of the total college enrolled population in 2006. However, there are only 26 Native-identified undergraduate students at USC, according to the school’s Office of Institutional Research. These students comprise only one-tenth of a percent of the University’s total undergraduate population. 
As it stands, Native Americans are one of the most underrepresented demographics on campus, as well as in the American workforce, media and education system. This week, I reached out to a Native American student to discuss what issues specifically affect this population, and how the USC community can help. 
As an activist, filmmaker, musician and president of the USC Native American Student Union, Mato Standing Soldier doesn’t match stereotypes. He’s light-skinned with a bleach blonde buzzcut. Aside from his T-shirt which reads, “Don’t worry, be native,” he bears no visible indication of indigenous affiliation. Growing up between Sioux Falls, S. D. and a nearby reservation, Standing Soldier felt the consequences of the United States’ structural bias against Native Americans. He struggled with truancy in school from having to juggle life in two locations, and mourned when women in his community were assaulted and murdered at a disproportionately high rate compared to the average American.
Standing Soldier acknowledged that USC treats its indigenous students well, and praised the University Religious Center for its support. However, he mentioned one serious issue: Lack of representation diminishes Native students’ power and their consequent ability to speak for themselves. 
For example, at an Undergraduate Student Government event in April, a vendor erected a teepee, which several students deemed culturally insensitive. USG organizers asked the vendor to take down the tent, and news of the incident quickly spread because of a post on a school Facebook page. 
The student organizers were quick to release an apology, and unsurprisingly, students were quick to take sides and share their perspectives on the matter.
“What was concerning on my end was that nobody even consulted the [Native American] Student Union,” Standing Soldier said. “No one sought to get input from Native Americans or from any outlet or person who might be directly affected by this stereotype.” 
Standing Soldier explained that it wasn’t the teepee that upset him most, but the native community’s exclusion from the conversation. 
“That’s where my area of concern lied, there wasn’t a lot attention given to our opinions and our viewpoint on the matter,” he said. “I feel that when you see something that you might take offense to, you want to go to the source of whoever you feel it may be impacting.”
When Native American students were not given a chance to express their opinions, Standing Soldier realized the lack of sensitivity toward his culture’s existence.
“It’s detrimental to our livelihood … because it puts us in a historical box,” he said. “We’re only allowed to belong in the images that you picture for us.” 
Standing Soldier explained that native students exist in different parameters.
“We’re just as human as anyone else,” Standing Soldier said. “But through mascots, through imagery and through Hollywood, we’re seen in a different light that’s actually detrimental to us because we’re seen as the past, we’re seen as history, and not as a current people … We’re not given attention and therefore we’re not given justice.”
By jumping into contentious rhetoric and excluding the voices of the affected individuals, students are then partaking in an act of ignorance that creates outrage out of sympathy. 
Indigenous Peoples’ Day is coming up next Monday. This year, we should celebrate the present, history and future of our Native American peers by actually listening to them. 
The Native American Student Union meets Monday evenings at 7:30 p.m. at University Religious Center. I implore you to come by and hear what they have to say.

Conservative commentator and political pundit Ben Shapiro’s upcoming speaking event at Bovard Auditorium has received mixed reviews. The Black Student Assembly, Latinx Student Assembly and Asian Pacific American Student Assembly released an unsigned statement last weekend, voicing their anger at USC and USG for funding the event. The unease of these student groups is centered on the degree of law enforcement and the safety of students, as the increased presence of police enforcement “has the potential to put black and brown communities at serious risk for being racially profiled or targeted,” according to the statement. 
The statement also expressed fear that Shapiro’s presence will be “a catalyst for the dangerously radical conservatives and white supremacists already present on campus.”
Unintentional dissemination of discriminatory speech on campus is a cause for anxiety, and campus-wide controversy is inevitable. However, universities should be environments where students can explore different political opinions and ideologies. Seeking to greet this controversy with an open mind is a deliberate choice that students can make.
Shapiro is — for lack of a better word — provocative. In his visit to UCLA in 2017, he discussed his views on gay sex and marriage as sins. He also believes that transgender people are mentally ill, as he has stated to news outlets multiple times. During his visit to the University of Connecticut in January, he replied to a question about why a transgender woman could not use the pronoun “she”:  “Because it is a lie.” He also is opposed to the Black Lives Matters movement, arguing that socio-economic disparities among black Americans is not the result of racism, but rather a “mentality of victimhood.” 
Shapiro is aware that his perspectives are subject to disagreement. While his position appears to delegitimize and silence the voices of people with opposing views, in reality Shapiro invites those with perspectives different from his to question him first at his speeches.
“I love taking questions,” he said, at his talk in Berkeley last year. “It’s my favorite thing, and I have a rule which is if you disagree with me, raise your hand and go to the front of the line, because discussion makes the country better.” 
His positions against victimhood reside in the belief that accepting it “makes the country a worse place,” along with an unwillingness to handle disagreement. 
Liberal and conservative parties are both guilty of close-minded thinking, in which it is rare to engage with those sharing dissonant views. This refusal to listen has removed both parties from upholding their integrity as establishments promoting the First Amendment. However, when stripped away from political interests, both parties share a binding and elemental concern over what is best for the United States. Shapiro shares in the belief that willingness to pursue free speech in discourse is what “makes the country better.”
There are defensible and credible reasons for protesting Shapiro’s arrival, especially for students whose identities and experiences are delegitimized by his speech. But an attempt to shut down Shapiro’s discussion and a refusal to listen to what he has to share plays into the stereotype of liberals seeking to remove contradictory views from university settings. It can also be viewed as the perpetuation of political polarization and an unwillingness to transcend differences.
USC students should be encouraged to lean into unpleasant conversations. While engaging with hateful rhetoric might create fears of spreading such ideas, having a will to hear out these opinions can also decrease polarity among people of different political beliefs. This exposure even provides those willing to listen with an awareness of a counterargument, and an opportunity to pursue the American value of democracy. But it is necessary to seek exposure, in order to decrease anger and increase empathy. 
With Shapiro’s visit, USC students have the opportunity to set an example for how elected politicians in office should practice: with an open mind, unapologetically willing to seek solutions presented by both sides of the political spectrum for how to best govern the United States.

Students exited Fertitta Hall last October after an active shooter was reported in the building. The rest of campus entered an hour-long lockdown, despite the reports being false. (Tal Volk | Daily Trojan)
One year after false reports of an active shooter prompted USC to enter an hour-long lockdown, the Department of Public Safety said it has taken multiple measures to ensure that the University is better equipped to handle similar scenarios in the future.
The incident was prompted by a professor who falsely claimed that there was a shooter inside of Fertitta Hall. The professor is no longer listed as a faculty member on the USC directory.
Captain Edgar Palmer said DPS has been working to improve the TrojansAlert system after issues arose during the false alert last year. Many students were left confused about what was happening and what to do after the shooting reports.
“I think that [communication] was something that we needed to be more on the same page with,” Palmer said. “Everyone needs to understand if they need to be staying in shelter or in place, or proceeding a certain area.”
Some students were concerned that they received the TrojansAlert notification six minutes after LAPD had received the call of a possible shooter, the Daily Trojan reported after the incident.
“We have to be careful … people always want an alert right away, but we have to put out the correct information,” Palmer said. “Sometimes, it takes a little longer to put out the correct information, so that’s something people should understand.”
Along with making TrojansAlert more location-specific, DPS has increased the number of staging areas LAPD can work out of during emergency situations after last year’s incident. 
DPS hopes that by increasing the amount of response staging areas, LAPD and others can effectively respond to emergencies and devise plans closer to incident locations. 
“The biggest takeaway from [the incident] was communication with staff and instructors. Instructors don’t allow phones on in the classroom and they shut their own phones off, and that’s problematic,” Palmer said. “In the case where students are looking toward their professor and asking, ‘What should we do,” and it’s a problem when the professor doesn’t know, we are taking things like that seriously.”
USC declined to comment.

Three students attended the Survivor and Ally Reflection Space event hosted by the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment Monday to discuss vulnerability and open-mindedness. (Dimple Sarnaaik | Daily Trojan)
The Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment held a public Survivor & Ally Reflection Space event at Ronald Tutor Campus Center, where three students discussed the recent hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the importance of having vulnerable conversations and how USC can provide additional funding for resources.
After a 20-minute delay due to miscommunication regarding the event location, the session began with a discussion about the Kavanaugh hearing and the pain of watching the proceedings alone. The students also commented on Monday’s rally regarding an email Price School of Public Policy professor James Moore sent last week stating “accusers sometimes lie” in sexual abuse allegations. 
Michaela Murphy, a junior majoring in public policy, spoke about the frustration of seeing people in positions of authority being insensitive to victims’ pain. The conversation also included the men’s actions against these hearings and protests. 
“The silence is deafening,” Murphy said. “When you have people in positions not setting a standard in a situation when it’s already difficult to seek out help, where are you supposed to turn to?”
Kavisha Prajapati, a sophomore majoring in political science, shared her thoughts about the conversation.
“It’s tough because it’s a very heavy topic that people don’t go around mentioning on the daily, but I feel like conversations like these definitely help,” Prajapati said. 
Prajapati also stated that the issue with these voluntary conversations is that the few people who show up are the usually the only ones open to learning more.  
“I think the issue is [that] we need to educate people who aren’t aware about it and who aren’t showing up to these meetings,” Prajapati said. “I don’t know how we can bring more awareness to people who aren’t aware.”
Prajapati spoke of her male friends who she said are respectful, yet fearful of the undefined boundaries between appropriate and inappropriate conduct. The three students agreed that a willingness to listen was the first step for men to take, and cited the importance of addressing the toxic masculinity that is “embedded everywhere into society.”
“I would like to see more funding and support in different resource centers,” Murphy said. “Don’t give me another Provost [Michael] Quick memo …Take those steps first before you put in a Trader Joe’s or a Target at the Village.”
Despite hosting the event, no leaders from SAGE attended.

It’s been 76 years since President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order that formally began the internment of Japanese Americans.
An upcoming exhibit at the Japanese American National Museum will use virtual reality and other technologies to tell the stories of those who were forced to relocate internment camps. The project is slated to be completed and open to the public within two years.
Kraig Fujii, a senior majoring in media arts and practice, met Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism alumnus Kevin Tsukii when he interned at Emblematic, an entertainment company that specializes in emerging technologies. The two connected over a mutual interest in telling the stories of Japanese Americans who were in the internment camps. 
“It has been something that was on both of our minds for quite some time so [I’m] kind of just really glad we kind of came together,” Tsukii said.
Many who lived through Japanese American internment firsthand are now in their 80s and 90s. 
“In order for each generation to hear them frame their own stories from the source itself … we thought it was important to do everything we can right now because we have the technology to start to preserve stories,” Tsukii said.
Through VR, the exhibit will place each patron into the life of an interned person and take them through their experience in the camps.
“For example, you would see soldiers come to your house and take your things or force you to leave your home,” Fujii said. “Actually seeing it in the VR space, it ends up having a much more emotional impact for people.”
After sorting through testimony, Fujii and Tsukii determined they wanted to base the project on the experiences of one individual: Stanley Hayami, a teenager who died at 19 during the war.
“That’s something that really spoke to me.” Tsukii said. “He [was] just a kid really interested in football, really interested in weight lifting … He’s worried about his Spanish grade, these sorts of things that [show] he’s just a kid.”
The project is based on Hayami’s diaries, which paint a picture of a young man reflecting on the injustices he experienced while navigating his teenage years and wanting to prove his patriotism. 
“He’s the perfect kind of subject because he was so introspective and so reflective about what was going on around him and he was also a really artistic person,” Fujii said. “People can see his illustrations come to life and see what he was thinking and kind of get into his head during the time.”
Tsukii and Fujii reached out to JANM and applied for a National Park Service Grant to fund their project. 
“We decided to apply to this grant to the National Park Service Grant because it was specifically targeted towards education about Asian American issues and specifically about and around Japanese American historical sights,” Fujii said.
They were shocked when NPS awarded them a grant for $300,000 to complete their project in a two-year window.
“In the coming months, we’re going over with the museum and seeing which exhibition space we can use,” Fujii said. “Hopefully it can be a permanent exhibition in the museum, which would be really cool.”
The grant will also go toward parts of the exhibit other than VR; Fujii and Tsukii plan to integrate augmented reality to create an experience for users at home. 
“Ideally people don’t even need to visit the museum [to] still get some experience about the project,” Fujii said. “It’s kind of multi-tiered, multi-approach installation based project.” 
Through the exhibit’s interactivity, the two hope to encourage people to think critically about how America historically treats minority groups.
“What I most hope for people to get from this experience is its kind of recognition about how the government has treated minorities, especially racial minorities, in the U.S.,” Fujii said.
Looking at the United State’s recent mistreatment of racial minority groups, Fujii said it isn’t difficult to imagine history repeating itself.
“It’s not a far stretch to say that something like this could happen again,” Fujii said. “I want to inform users and really inform people that this is a big moment in Asian American history and our goal would be to make sure this never happens again.”

Students held posters with statements about Price professor James Moore and his controversial email. Price students Joelle Montier and Audrey Mechling, along with a few others who attended the event, shared their own experiences of sexual assault. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Nearly 30 students gathered in Argue Plaza Monday calling for the firing of Professor James Moore after he wrote that “accusers sometimes lie” in an email to the entire Price School of Public Policy last week.
The rally, which was organized by Price students Joelle Montier and Audrey Mechling, came after an extensive email chain prompted by Moore’s reply to an invitation for an event called “Coffee and Title IX” organized by Price Women and Allies.
“If the day comes you are accused of some crime or tort of which you are not guilty, and you find your peers automatically believing your accuser, I expect you find yourself a stronger proponent of due process protections than you are now,” Moore wrote on Thursday. “Accusers sometimes lie.”
Mechling responded and called Moore a “pitiful excuse of a professor.” Price Dean Jack Knott also addressed Moore’s email, calling his remarks “insensitive and incendiary.”
At Monday’s event, Mechling and Montier, along with a few other women, shared their assault stories. 
Montier called for the firing of Moore and said he should be disciplined “at the highest level possible” at USC. The protesters also held up posters with statements such as “Fire James Moore,” “I am not a liar” and “Believe women.”
“To be clear, I take no joy in standing here and sharing my most painful memory with the world, but I refuse to stand by and let another human being go through what I went through,” Montier said. “Rapists must be held accountable for their actions. Rape enablers, like Professor Moore, must be held accountable for their actions.”
Mechling explained that Moore’s email “broke her” and that “instead of blaming myself, instead of staying quiet, instead of internalizing my rage,” she had decided to “let it all out” at the rally.
Following a few similar speeches, the crowd marched to Lewis Hall, where they were halted by DPS Chief John Thomas. He explained that the chanting crowd would not be allowed inside, since it would be disruptive to those in the building. The crowd intended to deliver their protest posters to Knott. Thomas explained that he would allow two people to hand deliver the posters.
Knott instead addressed the crowd outside of the building and received posters from protesters as they continuously chanted “Time’s up. No Moore.” Knott assured ralliers that Price school administrators would push for education on issues surrounding sexual assault and implicit biases. 
“Thank you for making this a very important issue, highlighting this and taking the time,” Knott said. “I’ve had literally hundreds of emails from all of kinds of people telling their stories and I want to hear those stories. I take this all very seriously.”
Knott also explained that he had met with leaders of PWA, the organizers of “Coffee and Title IX,” which prompted Moore’s email reply.
“We don’t want [the email chain] to become derailed into something like this, but we also want to have a forum for open discussions so people get to debate these issues,” Knott said. “We want people to participate in a responsible way … in a way that respects others and doesn’t, in this case, throw something out like this that can cause a tremendous amount of injury.”
Moore said he watched the rally and thought it was “well organized” and that the organizers were “heartfelt about their concerns.” However, he thought their request that he be fired was not well thought out.
“The whole point of a university is that it’s a place for points of view and discourse and if they happen to disagree the way to respond is to engage rather than terminate the source of the information that you disagree with,” Moore said.
Moore added that he does not want to harm anyone and that he understands some students have been victims of sexual assault. 
“My primary objective was protecting the interests of folks who might be falsely accused of misconduct,” Moore said. “My goal was protecting students, not traumatizing or bullying them.”
