In the world of stand-up, the days of “Women be shoppin” and “How about airline food?” are out, and curling up in a ball and sobbing are in. 
Many people claim comedy has lost its bite — that politically correct humor is destroying the genre. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Todd Phillips, well-known as the director of “Joker” (2019), claims “woke culture” has ruined comedy, which is why he made the brave decision to quit the genre, devastating everyone waiting for a fourth installment of “The Hangover.” Ricky Gervais can’t seem to stop sharing a similar sentiment, most recently deciding to insert himself in the Chris Rock-Will Smith dilemma by going after Jada Pinkett Smith. 
Despite such claims, anti-woke comedy is flourishing. Gervais’ entire new stand-up tour is dedicated to getting canceled, making it his duty to heroically fight against political correctness. Louis C.K. and Dave Chappelle are also both thriving in the face of the woke culture they claim is ruining comedy, with C.K. even recently winning a Grammy. 
Still, these same men continue to say new stand-up comedy is weak fluff, not at all similar to the hard-hitting and groundbreaking transphobia they built their careers on. 
Yet, the latest and greatest stand-ups are hitting the audience harder than ever before. That’s because the days of ranting about your wife to a crowd have been replaced with raw, devastating and dark confessions. 
In December 2020, James Acaster premiered his special, “Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999,” after the success of his 2017 Netflix original, “Repertoire.” The four-part special saw Acaster playing different characters, such as a man in witness protection, while slyly incorporating aspects of his real life. However, “Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999” was unabashedly personal.
Funnily enough, the very start of his two-act special is a monologue calling out Gervais for using transphobia as comedy. Acaster then segues into bits about his adolescence and Brexit. However, the stand-up takes a turn in the second act, where Acaster speaks bluntly about his struggle with mental health and suicidal ideations — a steep departure from his past work focused on football chants and gluten-free bread. If his name doesn’t ring a bell, you may know Acaster from the “Started making it. Had a breakdown. Bon Appetite” meme. While that meme has spread everywhere, Acaster divulges that the moment was his lowest mentally — an uncomfortable backstory for those who have laughed at the image set. 
The norm of stand-up comedy is to set up a story and end it at a punchline; there is no need to speak on the aftermath or include details. However, Acaster specifically starts at the punchline to transition into the aftermath that most traditional comedians would ignore to prioritize laughs. 
Acaster is nowhere near being the first comedian to subvert a previously used punchline into serious discussion.
Hannah Gadsby’s 2018 Netflix Special, “Nanette,” represented a new phase in her life, a time where she foregoes the self-deprecating humor that she built her career on to detail the traumatic experiences that brought her to the stage. She begins the show as normal but abruptly announced that she was “quitting comedy” before delving into the struggles she experienced as a lesbian woman. While some comedic moments remained, her comedy show was not so much about laughs as it was about telling her story. 
Gadsby specifically takes time to tell her coming out story, something she has done in other specials, but this time, she does not end with a punchline. This time, she talks about the aftermath of coming out, the part of coming out where her family did not accept her and the part where she was brutalized and assaulted, which she pushed to the sides for so many years to entertain audiences. 
This trend, of comedians sharing honest coming out stories, continues with Jerrod Carmichael’s HBO special, “Rothaniel,” which premiered earlier this month. During the special, Carmichael comes out as gay. While many past stand-ups use their coming out story as a bit, Carmichael is not doing that; he is simply coming out and sharing the pain that came with it. He details the strain his queerness placed on his relationship with his mother, the person he considered himself closest to who now tries to “pray the gay away.”  
The special, which lasts less than an hour, breaks the norms of stand-up. Whereas most comics try to fill up their time with as many jokes and bits as possible, “Rothaniel” thrives on extended, devastating moments of silence. Instead of the comedian talking to members in the audience, the audience calls out to Carmichael, and not just heckles, but asks deep questions about his self-identity and mother. It’s not so much a comedy show as it is a therapeutic experience. 
While punchlines are speckled throughout, “Rothaniel” is not an easy watch. Neither are “Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999” or “Nanette.” The movement of comedians no longer focusing on pure comedy is growing exponentially. The future of comedy is truth-telling, and the ugly, hard-to-hear truths are at the center.

Getting show recommendations from your friends is quite common (especially if you’re close with an SCA student), but choosing the right show can be a challenge. How many pilots have you watched before realizing that you and the person who told you about the show have very different tastes in TV? With the semester nearing its end, it can be impossible to find the time to sit down and watch an episode or two, but no matter how dedicated of a student you are, breaks are important. And what better way to escape from your responsibilities than by watching comedy? 
No matter what streaming platform you have, there is a comedy show recommendation that is perfect for you. Here are five current comedy shows for you to watch and rewatch right now. 
“Our Flag Means Death”
(HBO Max) 
Out of all the shows on this list, “Our Flag Means Death,” created by David Jenkins, certainly gets the most buzz — not only for its overwhelming popularity, adoring fans and powerful performances — but because HBO has not announced its fate for a possible second season. Taika Waititi and Rhys Darby star in this 1717 pirate rom-com that follows Stede Bonnet (Darby), also known as “The Gentleman Pirate,” who has a non-traditional way of captaining his crew. After we meet the hilarious cast, history’s greatest pirate Blackbeard (Waititi) hops on board Stede’s ship, “The Revenge,” and changes everything forever. “Our Flag Means Death” has outstanding queer representation that has sparked massive support from the LGBTQIA+ community, ultimately giving the show a large and supportive online fanbase. 
There really is no excuse to not find time to watch this show, especially since students are given access to HBO Max through the school. So log in, click “Approve” on that Duo Mobile Two Factor Access and set sail on your journey on board “The Revenge.” 
“Barry” (HBO Max)
Want to watch a comedy show on HBO Max but pirates aren’t really your thing? Check out “Barry,” created by Bill Hader and Alec Berg. This dark comedy follows Barry Berkman (Hader), a skilled hitman who contemplates his profession when he follows a guy he is hired to kill to a Los Angeles theater class, which unlocks a newfound passion for acting that Barry grapples with throughout the series. This show has everything: it’s action-packed and finds humor in uncomfortable and dreary situations. Hader shows off his range and proves he can do much more than just comedy as he brings to life this complex character.
Now, if you are not a fan of violence or anything gory, “Barry” is a show you may wish to steer clear of. But if you are fine with it, get watching. The third season of “Barry” premieres April 24 on HBO Max, and this hit show is one you won’t want to miss. 
“Dollface” (Hulu) 
Are you looking for more of a “feel-good show?” Do you enjoy female-led comedies or stories about friendship and connection? Then Hulu’s “Dollface,” created by USC alumna Jordan Weiss, is perfect for you. “Dollface” follows the tale of Jules (Kat Dennings), who, after a messy breakup with her five-year boyfriend, must learn how to survive in the girl world that she has been removed from for so long. Jules learns how she wants to live her life now that she’s single again, and discovers that just because she’s not someone’s girlfriend, it doesn’t mean she’s alone. 
“Dollface” is a lighthearted comedy with an element of fantasy that is all about reconnecting with old friends and learning which relationships are most important in your life. This show is perfect if you just got out of a relationship and need a good laugh, or if you couldn’t be happier with just having your best friends by your side.
“What We Do in the Shadows” (Hulu) 
Vampire enthusiasts, night owls and horror comedy fans — this show’s for you. Based on the 2014 feature film with the same name and created by Jemaine Clement and Waititi (which was based on their 2005 short film), “What We Do in the Shadows” follows the same premise as the originals but with a new set of characters. 
WWDITS is about vampires Nandor, Laszlo, Nadja, Colin Robinson and their human familiar Guillermo living together in a house on Staten Island. The vampires face the struggles of fitting in with modern society while still holding true to their way of life that they have held up for hundreds of years, which, of course, creates amusing clashes with the humans around them. 
One of the great things about the show in comparison to the film is that the dynamic between the characters is more varied. The TV show introduces the audience to Nadja, a female vampire who is married to Laszlo. She gives the show a female perspective and a couple dynamic and all the issues that arise with being married to someone for over 100 years. WWDITS is truly one of the funniest shows out there and consistently maintains this level of excellence throughout the three seasons. The fourth season is set to premiere sometime later this year. 
“Derry Girls” (Netflix)
And finally, if you’re looking for a show on Netflix, look no further than “Derry Girls.” Created by Lisa McGee, this coming-of-age comedy only has six episodes per season and two seasons (with a third on the way), so it’s a quick watch. “Derry Girls” is the story of five teenagers growing up in Derry, Northern Ireland, in the ‘90s, during the Northern Ireland Conflict. The series starts when four friends — Erin, Orla, Michelle and Claire (played by “Bridgerton’s” Nicola Coughlan) — are joined by Michelle’s English cousin, James, who just moved to Derry. The five of them embark on many different adventures as they attend Catholic school under the leadership of a witty and deadpan nun, and enjoy other classic teenage milestones like school dances and crushes, all while Derry experiences car bombings and protests. 
While the release date for the third season in the United States has yet to be announced, “Derry Girls” just started their weekly release of episodes on Channel 4 in the U.K., which is scheduled to finish May 17, so expect it on Netflix sometime soon after.

USC Student Health is conducting wastewater surveillance testing for the coronavirus at USC Housing facilities, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said during a student media briefing Tuesday. The University has worked on the program since January and is now in the trial process following reliable results from testing. 
The wastewater testing detects the virus approximately four days before residents become symptomatic, providing time for USC Health to contact students and have them test, Van Orman said.
“We can’t say, ‘Well, we have ‘x’ value in the wastewater that means that ‘x’ number of people are infected in that building,’” Van Orman said. “What we can do, though, is say when we start to see a building that’s getting more detection than another building or when we are noticing that it’s higher than it was. So we have started sending notifications to [those] buildings.”
Student Health has sent emails to those living in housing facilities with high levels of coronavirus detection, encouraging them to get tested. According to the department, several residential colleges, including New North, Parkside Arts & Humanities, Parkside International Residential College, as well as Century Apartments, have sent residents emails notifying students of the detected coronavirus in the wastewater. 
Adam Smith, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering, organized wastewater testing for the University and has also been doing sampling for Los Angeles. 
“[Wastewater surveillance testing] is a great way and, in some ways, an easier way [of detecting positivity for the coronavirus] than making students take tests once or twice a week,” Van Orman said. “What we were hoping for is that we could more readily target those areas where people needed to be testing and that’s a little bit easier for everyone.”
Van Orman said 247 community members tested positive last week, 61 of which were self-reported. Last week, USC reported 259 positive cases. 
According to Van Orman, 176 students and 15 employees are currently in isolation. Eighty-nine people occupied quarantine spaces provided by the University as of Tuesday and 141 spots remain available. 
Los Angeles County and the University are seeing consistent coronavirus numbers, with cases not exponentially increasing or declining, said Van Orman, who received the information from a recent briefing with L.A. County Department of Public Health. 
Van Orman encourages all who have recently traveled to get tested, regardless of whether they show symptoms, especially following a weekend of holidays and music festivals. 
“We do know that fewer students are testing so that may certainly mean that there are some cases going undetected,” Van Orman said. “But we are really just continuing to encourage students to make sure that they test if they are symptomatic.”
L.A. County dropped masking requirements for ride-sharing and airline transportation Tuesday. However, private businesses may still require masks. As such, USC Public Transportation will continue enforcing a mask mandate. 
Van Orman said she still recommends wearing masks on public transportation, particularly because of its high-risk in contracting and spreading the coronavirus. 
“You’re in a large, very close quarters with people you don’t know,” Van Orman said.“So, while it’s not mandated or absolutely required, I strongly, strongly recommend people to wear a mask when they’re on public transportation.”

Content warning: This article contains reports of sexual assault and violence. 
Outgoing Chief Diversity Officer Kavita Rai presented a review of the Interfraternity Council Working Group at the Undergraduate Student Government senate meeting Tuesday. USG’s goal for the working group is to increase student oversight to administration complicity, ensure that student voices are heard and provide a pulse on campus climate and student perception to administrative solutions.
The working group, created in early December 2021, worked to make recommendations to Provost Charles Zukoski regarding the terms and duration of the University’s suspension of IFC events following multiple reports of sexual assault and drugging at the Sigma Nu Fraternity house last October. 
The group’s risk team has been working with Fraternity & Sorority Leadership Development to provide onsite review and support to IFC chapters hosting social events and providing “sober rooms,” designated areas where individuals attending the party can go when they feel overwhelmed and be provided food and water. 
“We’ve gotten a lot of positive feedback from Panhellenic folks about sober rooms and the risk team procedure, feeling an overall safer environment,” Rai said. 
The group also discussed prevention education designed to move away from module-based compliance learning to in-person interactive learning with the help of internal and external partners. 
The group looks towards having strong engagement to support students and providing resources such as Relationship & Sexual Violence Prevention outreach, having embedded counselors in University cultural centers and mandating accessible fentanyl and drug test strips at all USC-sponsored social events. 
At last week’s senate meeting, senator Aidan Feighery introduced a resolution calling for a stronger University response to social media posts made on Lunar New Year. The student’s posts on USC’s Instagram account celebrating Lunar New Year resulted in backlash from Asian community members. The resolution looks to recall attention to this issue and ask for a formal apology from the University.
At this week’s meeting, the senate raised questions about whether or not the resolution would be an appropriate solution to this situation and discussed the process of whether or not the senate is overusing their resolutions. 
After a lengthy discussion, the resolution failed to pass, with two votes for yes, three abstains and seven votes for no. Many of the senators cited that they voted no because of the lack of direct support from the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly and whether or not this resolution will do anything if passed. 
“The consensus I heard from most of the senate is that they agreed with the goal of the resolution but disagreed that a resolution was the right way to get it done,” Feighery said. “I respect the difference of opinion and look forward to my work with student groups and the administration in bringing about solutions that will address this issue and prevent similar ones from occurring in the future.” 
Prior to the senate meeting, a pre-senate meeting was held to introduce the senate to the committee chairs’ nominations.
Vice president Nivea Krishnan later announced the committee chair nominations at the meeting. If approved, the committee chairs would include Hunter Hinson, a junior majoring in political science and communication, as the chair of affordability & basic needs; Julianna Melendez, a freshman majoring in international relations, as the chair of accessibility; Sara Stienecker, a freshman majoring in political science, as the chair of campus operations and sustainability; Kate Hsu, a junior majoring in international relations and global economy, as the chair of academic affairs; Monica Rodrigues, a freshman majoring in quantitative biology, as the chair of external affairs; Phong Doozy, a junior majoring in health and human sciences, as the chair of wellness and David Martinez, a sophomore majoring in public policy as the parliamentary secretary.  
Chief communications officer Paul Yi also announced 12 candidates as nominations to the communications department. 
“I also really stressed gender parity [when selecting candidates],” Yi said. “So, you will notice there are five men and there are seven women in terms of the candidates … Also, I stressed external organization experiences as well as direct USG related experience so there’s a mix of those to have a healthy balance.”
The senate will confirm next year’s committee chairs and the members of the communications department at next week’s meeting.

As the University celebrates Earth Week, students, staff and faculty look for ways to deal with climate anxiety, a sense of despair that may result from the global climate crisis. Pamela Tobi Fishel discussed how she approaches the topic from a psychological perspective, while students discussed how they use their strengths to find ways to make a positive impact in the environment while not getting overwhelmed and burnt out. 
According to Fishel, a professor of pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, most types of anxieties result from fears that stem from stories that people have in their heads based on past lived experiences. However, climate anxiety derives specifically from worry rooted in events, such as the extinction of different species and climate change, that are currently taking place, Fishel said.
“[Psychologists] want to help folks be able to feel their feelings and connect to the natural world and know what’s going on and not be overwhelmed by it and collapse,” Fishel said.
Climate anxiety, while not exclusive to young people, manifests differently in individuals across the lifespan. Older adults tend to lean towards feelings of grief over the damage the Earth experiences, while younger people tend to feel anger and disappointment over the lack of action being taken to manage the climate crisis. 
“[Older adults] might not be looking at the next 50 years of what’s going to happen to the planet,” Fishel said. “But young people are looking at what’s going to happen in 50 years when [they are older].”
As a clinical psychologist, Fishel has spent a great deal of her career bringing awareness to and teaching people to deal with feelings of anxiety and depression. When she started to work on her own emotional healing 30 years ago, she participated in many nature-based retreats, where she learned that connecting to the natural world and loving it were integral to emotional healing.
“I’ve developed a passion for helping other folks find the medicine, and the natural world and our real connection and how we can heal,” Fishel said. “I’ve always connected people to the natural world, and both our grief and also our love.”
This compelled Fishel to create workshops aimed at coping with climate anxiety. Her newest workshop, “Finding Calm in the Storm: A Workshop on Climate Anxiety and Love for Our Planet,” took place Tuesday in collaboration with Dr. Camille Dieterle, an occupational therapist and professor of clinical occupational therapy at the Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy.
“We have to come together in groups so that we’re not feeling like [we’re] the only one [experiencing climate anxiety],” Fishel said. “We actually all care, and let’s figure out ways that we can really take a deep dive into how we are living our life. Can we think of ways it is important to us to change how we’re living our lives so that we feel like we’re not contributing to the collapse of the planet?”
For Olivia Heffernan, a junior majoring in environmental studies, her upbringing gardening in her backyard and camping outdoors translated to her interest in environmental issues and eventually led her to join the SC Garden Club, a student organization that manages a community garden at Parkside Arts & Humanities Residential College, where she now serves as co-president. Her field of study requires her to be constantly surrounded by news about environmental issues, which can be overwhelming and cause climate anxiety, she said.
To decompress, Heffernan tries to balance the negative news she sees with positive news. She also surrounds herself with like-minded individuals working towards bettering the environment. Little actions to conserve the planet are more important than trying to be a “perfect environmentalist,” she said.
“Be proud of the little things that you do every day for the Earth,” Heffernan said. “It can get overwhelming when you think there’s nothing that you can do, but I really think that there is something that everyone can do on an individual level.”
Similarly, Matt Slade, a senior majoring in international relations and East Asian languages and cultures, has a passion for hiking and being outdoors. When he came to USC, this passion motivated him to join Peaks & Professors, an organization that plans hikes and other outdoor excursions with student groups and professors. Echoing Heffernan’s sentiments, Slade said that news about climate disasters and government failure to tackle the issue contributes to climate anxiety among his peers.
Apart from serving as president of Peaks & Professors, he focuses on small actions, such as not using single-use plastics and volunteering at urban gardens, to cope with his anxiety. Slade also tries to spend a lot of time outdoors and encourages others to do the same. 
“All outdoor [organizations] at this school and in any other school are really beneficial in that they give everyone a stake in this fight,” Slade said.
Fishel emphasized the importance of recognizing the communal effort necessary to save the planet. Trying to get involved in everything is part of the reason why people tend to get too overwhelmed and burn out. It is important to gather with more people that want to work for similar causes and find in which way to better serve the environment and, above all, the most important thing is to connect with nature, she said.
“If we remember that we love the planet, if we remember that we love the trees and the flowers and elephants and giraffes and bees,” Fishel said. “When we love something we take care of it. That’s what I want us to remember. We have to spend time in the natural world to remember that we love her.”

Warning: Your feelings may or may not be hurt.
With only two weeks of classes remaining and summer fast approaching, life feels more chaotic and messier than usual. All the chakras have unaligned and our good habits seem to have dissolved being replaced with the sticky, gooey remains of regret and bad decisions. 
But don’t have to let the ghosts of your bad decisions haunt you. Look to the stars and my extremely accurate horoscope guide based on my unbiased opinion instead. My credentials and expertise gained through putting up with Co-Star threatening me for the past two years are unmatched. 
Starting with some general advice for all signs: You are not enough. You never will be enough. It’s better to stop trying. As the fiery Aries season full of passion and ambition is replaced by the false lull of Taurus season’s bullheadedness, don’t be stupid. It’s not that hard. Don’t overthink it. Actually, don’t think at all. Switching off your brain will give you the power to do what actually needs to be done — no action, no reaction, only distraction.
Read on for your personally curated horoscope for today, created in conjecture with the movement and placement of neurons in my brain:
Aries (March 21 – April 19): 
With your fire diminished and the end of Aries season, there is simply no need for your energy. People no longer want to put up with you, but take that in stride, Aries, and leave. Go away. The further, the better. Pack your passport or pick out a new identity and start a new life until those in your life miss your presence and report you as a missing person to the police. 
Taurus (April 20 – May 20): 
It may be Taurus season, but that doesn’t mean you can simply plow your way through whatever you want. Good things await you, but only if you’re willing to work for them and follow the right path to achieve whatever it is you desire. But remember, it’s about the end results and not the journey that gets you there, so stop working so hard and instead burn the place down. Even the Earth must burn for a fresh start. 
Gemini (May 21 – June 20): 
There is only one truth, Gemini. In your pursuit of answers, you have been left with more questions than ever before. Not to worry, a fresh slate means new questions and new answers. For this, you must kill all of your existing brain cells to start anew. Your quest has gotten so complicated, drinking and head banging may be the only way to get the answers you seek.   
Cancer (June 21 – July 22): 
It is hibernation season, Cancer. Everyone has had enough of the emotional black hole you pull them into with each interaction. Sleep so you may not feel. Let your dreams drift you into a life better than the one you currently live so others can finally experience a life of peace without you playing the role of shoulder devil and angel at the same time. 
Leo (July 23 – Aug. 22): 
There is nothing to be said for the terror you have caused recently, Leo. As if alienating people wasn’t enough, karma returns with a vengeance to kick your ass. Don’t take anything or anyone for granted because it might be lost any second. The grim reaper has its sights on you, and there is nothing you can do to avoid the retribution that awaits you. The easiest thing to do would be to walk into the fire willingly and give yourself up.
Virgo (Aug. 23 – Sept. 22): Have you found yourself asking how you got here lately, Virgo? The answer lies within your place in the universe. You’re always doing too much and trying too much. It may be time to stop, pause and think about what it is that you truly want. Once you figure that out, do the very opposite. Your instincts are not to be trusted.   
Libra (Sept. 23 – Oct. 22): 
Life may have seemed easier lately, Libra, but it’s only because you’re on the precipice of an ocean that wants to swallow you whole. Don’t resist. Stop acting like your life and decisions are under your control and give in. The world may allow you to finally spread your wings and fly or chew you up and spit you out. There is only one way to find out!
Scorpio (Oct. 23 – Nov. 21): 
The universe wants you to take a chill pill, Scorpio, and stop overestimating your own importance. Too long you have lived in the dark like a shadow. Try coming into the light and proving once and for all that you are not a vampire. You too can indulge in simple human pleasures if you crawl out from under your rock. 
Sagittarius (Nov. 22 – Dec. 21): 
Get a grip, Sag. It is time to grow up. No longer can you go about life not caring and doing whatever comes in your head. Your recent troubles have come up due to your inability to stay at one place. Reach out to people you have been avoiding recently and show them you’re well and alive.  
Capricorn (Dec. 22 – Jan. 19):
Pick up your phone, Capricorn, and make that move you have been itching to make. Distracting yourself through work is not a solution, and it is time you start thinking of someone beyond yourself. Selfish actions have consequences, and you may lose what is right in front of you.   
Aquarius (Jan. 20 – Feb. 18): 
Do whatever the hell you want, Aquarius, because no one could care less. Even the universe is no longer acknowledging your presence, so wreak havoc and make yourself known.
Pisces (Feb. 19 – March 20): 
Stupid, silly fishy, it’s time for you to stop acting on your emotions and making your life harder. You can’t keep choosing the path of chaos and wonder how you ended up in the ditch. Pick yourself up and swim far away from the shore and any human interaction that has the power to hold you back. 
If following your horoscope doesn’t work, remember that you always have the power to run away from your responsibilities for a carefree life. Sometimes running away, maxing out your credit cards and starting a new life away from anyone you know is exactly what the stars ordered.

You’re walking through campus in the uncomfortably hot and nasty 95 degree Los Angeles weather. Sweat dripping, back soaking, face getting sunburnt, you begin to wonder if there’s anyone who could possibly help you release steam. Then, you remember the old reliable — dating apps.
It’s that season when you want to remove every possible layer of clothing because of the summer heat, and what better way to do it than with someone else helping you? There’s never a better time to find a fling than now. School is about to end. There are little to no responsibilities. Everyone’s in heat — both literally and figuratively.
Not sure how to navigate dating apps? Lucky for you, I have re-downloaded Tinder, Hinge and Bumble more times than I can count, not because I have found success but because it is an exhausting full-time job. Whether you don’t know how to send your first message or you matched with someone from work, Dr. Blingspice has you covered with the best advice to spark a new digital romance.
I’m new to dating and am having trouble making the leap to message people I’ve matched with on Tinder. It’s all so intimidating. Do you have any advice for good first messages?
Out of pocket is the way to go. Use their profile to your full advantage and make them the punchline of your first message.
The worst messages to initiate conversations have a blandness to them. Imagine you receive a notification on your phone saying “New Match!” and “Joe sent you a new message,” only to find out that it says, “Hey what’s up.” There’s nothing that dries and shrivels your sex drive up more than a zestless message from a sexy person. 
Be wacky and quirky (for lack of a better word) with your first message, maybe even a little raunchy. The goal is for them to open their Tinder and feel like they got slapped in the face. The best messages give your romantic target some material to work with. You want them to laugh, moan, sigh or cackle — anything is better than a sigh after a sad first message.
I matched with my boss on Tinder. What should be my next move?
Why stop at connecting with your boss on LinkedIn when you could match on Tinder and connect with them in a different way? While business and pleasure don’t typically go together, why not live a life of danger? The more content for your memoir, the better!
Knowing there’s a mutual interest, pursuing romance is an option. You just have to consider the potential risks and vibes at the workplace in the case that the love falls through. There’s bound to be awkwardness, especially if you work with the person frequently. 
However, if it is executed the right way, you might have locked in your summer fling. As SZA once mentioned, you can be their 9-to-5, literally. You can be the modern-day Monica Lewinsky but hopefully, without anyone getting impeached or scrutinized.
If you do pursue business romance, be considerate of others and don’t PDA in the workplace. People are there to collect a check, not to watch an X-rated live show.
I’m not interested in hookups and honestly scared of dating apps, but I don’t know how I’d find anyone to date otherwise. Advice on where to get started?
Coming from someone who has deleted and downloaded dating apps dozens of times, I always come to the same conclusion: It’s hard to meet people in person these days. Why would anyone be bold and confrontational when they can resort to hiding behind a phone screen?
Dating apps can be intimidating and a little embarrassing, but at the end of the day, almost every college student is there trying to find some variation of love, whether it be a spark to warm up their heart or someone looking to share some heat.
If you’re avoiding hookups, there are ways to establish what you and your matches are pursuing. You can typically gauge what a person is looking for based on their profile and their diction when they message you. If they have a shirtless picture or message you a simple “hey,” it’s a sign to drop them and run.
Dating apps don’t have to be sexual. It’s about learning to navigate them and keeping your guard up when you interact with people, at least until you know you’re both on the same page. Modern-day dating is digitized with an occasional chance of meeting someone in person. The first step is signing up for an app and letting the people know your heart and ass are up for grabs.

After a tumultuous postseason, college basketball teams are evaluating where they stand and what they hope to gain from the transfer portal. This offseason has already proven unpredictable for many teams around the nation. Here are some of the biggest moves and trends so far. 
USC will have roster turnover
USC has a particularly important offseason, as it will lose junior Isaiah Mobley, redshirt senior Chevez Goodwin and, possibly, senior Drew Peterson to the NBA Draft. However, the Trojans should expect some firepower coming, as their 2022 recruiting class is ranked No. 1 in the Pac-12 and No. 6 in the nation. If the Trojans can secure a few skilled transfers with experience to pair with the incoming freshman talent, they could be primed for a tournament run next season. 
Despite having a few pieces to build around, there’s a level of doubt around where USC goes from here. Extremely young teams have had success in the past, such as the 2018-2019 Duke team led by a freshman Zion Williamson. However, these teams still usually have growing pains in the beginning of the season until someone steps up as a clear leader on the team. For the Trojans to make a run in the tournament next year, incoming freshman center Vince Iwuchukwu will have to step up as a leader as Evan Mobley did last season. 
Wyoming robs Los Angeles
Wyoming was a fan favorite this season, winning 25 games in entertaining fashion and making the NCAA Tournament. They are now loading up with talent to make another run. Despite their impressive season, they were not at the top of my list to take some of USC’s most talented role players. Surprisingly, juniors forward Max Agbonkpolo and guard Ethan Anderson are transferring to the Cowboys. Further, junior forward Jake Kyman is transferring from UCLA. Agbonkpolo and Anderson are huge losses from USC, especially as the Trojans try to maintain some upperclassmen talent on the roster. Wyoming will be a force to be reckoned with next season based on their success in the transfer portal and the return of star Cowboys guard Hunter Maldonado. 
Arkansas appears at the top of rankings for next season
Are there any transfers that Arkansas doesn’t get? Only the ones that go to Wyoming, apparently. The Razorbacks have the No. 2 overall recruiting class and the No. 1 overall transfer class. Notably, five-star guard Anthony Black committed to the Razorbacks. Also, Arkansas secured former Missouri forward Trevon Brazile. For a team who made it to the Elite Eight for the second straight season, Arkansas continues to stack up for the coming season.
Duke has some work to do
For those that were hoping the Blue Devils would finally fade into irrelevance after the retirement of Coach K, you might have to wait a few more years. New Head Coach Jon Scheyer will have a dominant roster next season, even after six current Duke players commit to the NBA draft. After having the No. 1 recruiting class in 2022, the Blue Devils have the top class in 2023 as well. Duke’s most impressive recruit is Mackenzie Mgbako, a 6-foot-7 small forward from New Jersey that will add valuable size to their squad. Most way-too-early rankings have the Blue Devils ranked as the fourth to eighth best team, which is very high praise. Oftentimes, programs such as Michigan, USC and Texas are overrated in preseason rankings because of the prestige of their sports programs, only for them to underperform. Duke could suffer a similar fate next season, as I believe they would be ranked in the eighth through 12th range if they were not named Duke. Armed with a lot of young talent, but little experience, we will see if John Scheyer can prove critics wrong.  
St. Peters in rebuild mode
St. Peters made a historic run to the Elite Eight as a No. 15 seed, becoming one of the most memorable Cinderella stories in NCAA Tournament history. Since then, a mass exodus has ensued. Head Coach Shaheen Holloway left for Seton Hall, news which was made official before the end of the tournament. However, there was hope that the rest of the team would stay together, but that did not materialize. After St. Peters decided to look elsewhere for a new head coach instead of promoting assistant Ryan Whalen, most of their talent headed for the door. Notably, star guard Doug Edert transferred to Bryant University. Further, juniors guards Daryl Banks III and Matthew Lee and forwards Hassan and Fousseyni Drame are in the NCAA transfer portal. 
I had hoped this team would stay together, but usually, these Cinderella teams do not have a fairytale ending. It is a natural instinct for a star on one of these teams to search for a better situation after gaining national exposure from the tournament. The tragedy here is that, if they had promoted Whalen to the head coach role, they could have built around their current team and aimed to make another run next year. Instead, St. Peter’s had a beautiful, but very brief, moment to shine.

The NBA playoffs are here, and former Trojans are looking to help their teams advance to the championship. Evan Mobley finished a strong rookie season with productive play in the play-in tournament, and DeMar DeRozan, Nikola Vucevic and De’Anthony Melton are in the middle of exciting first-round matchups.
Power forward/center Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers
Although the Cleveland Cavaliers failed to make the NBA’s Play-In Tournament playoffs as the No. 8 seed, their young stars made strides in their development throughout the season. Former Trojan forward Evan Mobley was one of those young stars. Mobley, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, averaged 15 points per game on 50% shooting from the field to go along with 8.3 rebounds per game. Equally impactful on the defensive end, Mobley averaged 1.7 blocks per game. In his rookie season, Mobley appeared in 69 of 82 regular games for the Cavaliers this season.
In Cleveland’s two play-in games against the Brooklyn Nets, Mobley tallied 19 points, 7 rebounds and 2 blocks. Against the Atlanta Hawks Friday, Mobley had 18 points and 8 rebounds to go along with 5 assists and 2 blocks.
Guard DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls
With the Chicago Bulls back in the playoffs for the first time since the 2016-2017 season, former USC guard DeMar DeRozan has made his presence felt in his first season with the team. DeRozan averaged a career-high 27.9 points per game on 50% shooting from the field with 5.1 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game. DeRozan also made the All-Star team for the fifth time in his career, this time as a starter.
After a 38-21 start to the season, the Bulls struggled after the All-Star break and finished as the No. 6 seed in the East. In the first round of the playoffs, Chicago lost its first game in a nailbiter to the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks where DeRozan struggled. The guard went 6-for-25 from the floor and finished with just 18 points. DeRozan and the Bulls will look to step it up in game two Wednesday night.
Center Nikola Vucevic, Chicago Bulls
Much of the Bulls’ postseason success will be dependent on center Nikola Vucevic’s plays. In his first full season with the Bulls, Vucevic averaged a double-double with 17.6 points per game and 11 rebounds per game. 
In game one against the Bucks, the former Trojan had a double-double with 24 points and 17 rebounds but also inefficiently shot at 9-for-27 from the field. Vucevic and DeRozan were a combined 15-for-52 from the field and just 2-for-12 from three. Against the defending champion Bucks, the pair will need to ramp up their shooting efficiency to have any chance in the series.
Guard De’Anthony Melton, Memphis Grizzlies
The Memphis Grizzlies held the second-best record in the NBA this season and former Trojan guard De’Anthony Melton was a solid contributor. The fourth-year guard averaged 10.8 points per game on 40% shooting from the field and 37% from 3-point range. Melton also added 1.4 steals per game on defense and totaled 104 this season, a career-best.
Melton’s production increased to finish the regular season, averaging 16.8 points per game on 48% shooting from the field and 48% from the 3-point line. However, in game one against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Melton was not much of a factor, as he managed 2 points on 1-for-4 shooting. Melton will look to provide more consistent scoring off the Memphis bench as the series moves forward.
