With USC and the Los Angeles Times’ joint polling project underway, directors are emphasizing the involvement opportunities the polls offer students, but students seem unaware of those options.
USC’s College of Letters, Arts & Sciences and the LA Times are conducting a series of six polls leading up to the 2010 gubernatorial election. The collaboration is the first joint polling effort between the university and a local newspaper. The first of the six polls was released two weeks ago.
Though organizers hope the polls will leave a mark on the California political world, Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said the polls are equally important for their impact on students.
“The Dean [Howard Gillman, of the College] was particularly insistent that students would not only have opportunities to be involved, but they would also have education opportunities to learn from their involvement,” Schnur said.
According to Schnur and other political science professors, opportunities for students include formulating poll questions, running focus groups, analyzing results, pitching campaign strategies for candidates and working hands-on with professional political reporters from the Los Angeles Times.
Many of these opportunities for student involvement stem from six existing political science classes, the curriculums of which will be partly structured around the poll.
Students are able to register for these classes now, but many classes are not filling up quickly.
Though some of the classes are full because of students’ general interest, most students said they did not know about the extent of the opportunities awaiting them.
“I did know about the polls but I didn’t know they were going to be involved in this class,” said Jason Duong, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention major who will be taking an ethics and politics class. “It’s actually a pleasant surprise, I thought it was going to be just a lot of lecture and book work.”
Many other students said they weren’t aware the poll was a part of these classes, as professors have not included the polls in course descriptions or other materials.
“My plan is to talk to the students about the poll on the first day of class so they understand it is a part of the larger course goals,” Schnur said.
Schnur said he couldn’t really do much advertising because the poll will be one aspect of his class, not the whole class.
Still, some students said they would have liked to have known.
“There should have been some kind of advertisement to get over the shock factor,” said Samantha Howell, a sophomore majoring in political science and international relations. “Being a poli-sci major, why would you not want to be a part of a poll project? If they do advertise it, maybe other students would want to join the class.”
Students, however, said they are excited to be involved.
“I am actually thrilled about this,” said Drew Florio, a senior majoring in political science. “It will give me a snapshot of what I’ll be doing after school and I’ll be doing it with distinguished faculty.”
The classes are not the only way students can work with the polls next semester. Schnur said there will be many different programs awaiting students in the next couple years that will supplement the political poll project.
“We’ve received interest from all four gubernatorial campaigns about participating in our program and we intend to work with the campaigns for the US Senate and the major ballot initiatives as well,” Schnur said. “We want students to have a front row for the campaign season as it unfolds.”
Schnur also pointed out that anyone from any major could participate in these different opportunities.
“If a student wants to be involved, we will find a way that they can be,” Schnur said.

With the LA Live shuttle up and running, more students are leaving campus in favor of exploring entertainment and dining options in Downtown Los Angeles, but USC officials say they are not concerned about losing student business at USC’s restaurants.
When USC Hospitality opened The Lab, McKay’s and Rosso Oro’s Pizza in the spring, the idea for the LA Live tram had not yet developed. Six months later, though, USC Transportation and LA Live have partnered to provide students with an easy way to get away from McKay’s in favor of the Yard House or the other dining options Downtown.

But Hospitality insists it is not afraid of losing business to the competition further down Figueroa Street. Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, said Hospitality and Transportation, under the umbrella of USC Auxiliary Services, considered the implications of adding the free shuttle before giving the plan the go-ahead.
“[Auxiliary Services does] a ‘SWOT’ analysis … strengths, opportunities, weaknesses and threats,” Klinger said. “So providing a shuttle to LA Live outweighs quite a few of the costs we’ve considered.”
Michael Roth, vice president of communications for AEG, the company that runs LA Live, said the venue has seen a jump in student customers since the launch of the new shuttle.
But Tony Mazza, director of USC Transportation, said it seems those students are going Downtown more for entertainment than for dining.
“In the end, USC Transportation has seen students using the shuttle when they are going to the movies at Regal Cinemas, to go bowling or to attend a sporting event,” Mazza wrote in an email. “But not necessarily when they are looking for dining options.”
Ryoko Yoshida, a senior majoring in communication, said if she were just looking for a meal, she’d be more likely to go to The Lab because going to LA Live takes more planning.
“You’d have to wait for the shuttle and then wait even longer when you get [to LA Live] to be seated, when you could just call Campus Cruiser and head over to The Lab,” Yoshida said. “But, if I was going to a concert or something at the Staples Center, then I’d probably want to eat at one of the restaurants [at LA Live].”
In addition to restaurants, Roth said, LA Live offers other entertainment activities like attending a Clippers or Kings game, a concert, going to the movies or bowling ­— all at the same location. Still, he acknowledged that it takes a little more time to get to LA Live than The Lab, McKay’s or Rosso Oro’s Pizza, and said that might factor into students’ decisions.
Roth said the decision to eat near campus or at LA Live may also be based on the slightly higher costs at the restaurants Downtown. The Yard House, for example, has a very similar menu to The Lab and McKay’s, but appetizers and entrées cost between $2 to $5 more on average.
“We’re all on budgets and are supposed to make choices and selections based on that,” Roth said.
Klinger said students might also choose the Hospitality restaurants for the atmosphere.
“I think it’s a more unique environment.  There’s only one Lab and there’s a couple dozen Yard Houses, and it’s going to be mostly students at The Lab, whereas at the Yard House it’s going to be a mixture,” Klinger said.
But Yoshida said the collegiate atmosphere has a negative effect.
“Being older, I might want more of a diverse crowd at LA Live,” she said.
Yoshida said older students over the age of 21 could end up going to LA Live over The Lab with the intention of going out to Downtown bars and clubs.
Ramona Jhunjhnuwala, a freshman majoring in business administration who has used the LA Live shuttle to go out to eat with friends, said it’s about personal preference, regardless of the price.
“LA Live might be more expensive, but I liked it better,” she  said.

In an effort to raise awareness and participation in community service projects around USC, a new committee plans to bridge the gap between the residential community and the university’s Volunteer Center.
The SCivic Engagement Committee was founded by Pablo Ortiz de Urbina, the resident adviser of the service-based floor in Troy East, which gives students a chance to serve the community while also building a connection to the university.

The committee made its first effort at raising awareness by encouraging students to volunteer at Saturday’s Friends & Neighbors Day, where participants helped provide a face-lift for Casa de Rosa-Sunshine Mission, a local women’s shelter.
“My biggest task was to have the floor take [off] on its own, and I felt like it needed to be connected with USC,” said Urbina, a senior majoring in French horn performance. “There is never enough that you can do for others, you can always do more to help people.”
The committee will act as a liaison between Residential Education and the Volunteer Center, connecting thousands of students living in USC housing to the projects conducted through the center. Although the two organizations have worked together before, the new committee establishes a direct line of communication to campus residents.
“What’s nice about the committee is that it is connecting URC, the building governments … It makes sure that the partnership stays active and fluid,” said Carol Schmitz, director of Residential Communities. “It brings people across several different networks together.”
The SCivic Engagement Committee is made up of four different RAs assigned by Residential Education, with Volunteer Center Director Melissa Gaeke acting as its adviser. The committee plans to meet regularly to plan out ways of communicating volunteer opportunities to students, with emails and fliers.
“We act as a good friend who is there to remind students to give back,” Urbina said.
Although the committee can only directly contact students who live in university housing, Urbina said the system would be a good way of establishing awareness of volunteer opportunities for those who eventually move to private housing.
The committee attracted about 17 volunteers for its first event on Saturday, when it helped with the cleaning and gardening at Casa de Rosa. Though Urbina said he was happy with the turnout, he hopes the efforts of the committee will be even more persuasive over time to bring in more students.
The marketing efforts of the committee helped increase the number of volunteers for Friends & Neighbors Day last November to about 250 this year — up from 150 students, alumni and community members from the year before, according to Friends & Neighbors Day Coordinator Kim Ueyama.
Urbina is looking at ways to increase the growth of the committee and get more students to volunteer, maintaining that if people actually go out to the sites and see the impact of their efforts, more people will be active in volunteering.
“Hopefully we can design a strategy to raise people’s awareness,” Urbina said.
One suggestion he made was to design a series of “quick programs” that involve 10 students going to volunteer events every month at a site that is within walking distance.
A number of students appreciated the new effort from the committee, saying they would be interested in a system that alerted them to volunteer opportunities around campus.
“I’m always looking for opportunities to volunteer, but there aren’t any clubs that catch my eye,” said Ivana Dukanovic, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism. “It would make a difference if they found a creative outlet.”
Bo Chan, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, volunteered at Casa de Rosa after she saw fliers around her dorm and received emails from the committee.
“It was nice to help the community you are in,” Chan said. “I’m trying to get a lot more involved and this way is easy because they tell us what’s available rather than me coming up with my own thing.”

After protests and campaigning by student groups across the country — including USC’s Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation — Russell Athletic has decided to
rehire about 1,200 workers in Honduras who were fired after they unionized.
The campaign against Russell Athletic, which provides athletic clothing and gear for USC, was a major part of SCALE’s efforts to ensure USC works with companies that conduct fair labor practices. SCALE made an unsuccessful attempt to get USC to sever its licensing agreement with Russell Athletic when the company came under scrutiny for closing down its plant in Choloma, Honduras last year.
United Students Against Sweatshops, a nationwide student organization of which SCALE is an affiliate, also worked to mobilize students whose universities had ties with Russell Athletic. Now, organizations like SCALE and USAS have posted a victory with the rehiring of the workers and the re-opening of the factory,
“It’s really encouraging,” said Elias Kohn, a member of SCALE and a sophomore majoring in sociology. “It seems like you’re going against these far away ideas and the fact that the Russell campaign worked is a very positive thing for all of us.”
Elisabeth Gustafson, a member of SCALE and a junior majoring in history, said that when it became apparent that SCALE could not convince the university to sever ties with Russell Athletic, the group focused on pushing for USC to affiliate with the Workers Rights Consortium, an independent monitor of the global garment industry that was conducting an investigation into Russell’s activities.
“The WRC is mentioned as a major factor along with USAS in getting Russell to re-open its factory,” Gustafson said. “Now that there’s proof the WRC got Russell Athletic to change its policies, we hope we can convince the university to join the organization.”
USC is already a member of the Fair Labor Association, a separate watchdog organization, but some members of SCALE and USAS say the FLA is not as effective as the WRC because it has “conflicts of interest” in its organization.
“We base a lot of our information on WRC investigations,” said Jack Mahoney, a national organizer of USAS. “FLA has had apparel corporations as paying members and on its leadership board, so the FLA will not be able to give as accurate information as the WRC.”
Matthew Curran, the director of trademark licensing and social responsibility at USC, said the university was still in talks with SCALE to consider whether the university will join the WRC.
“Between our membership with the FLA and our own internal monitoring program, we need to see what additional value the WRC would add to the programs we already have above and beyond what we’re currently doing,” Curran said.
Earlier this semester, the group met with Curran and other members of the administration to discuss the university’s relationship with the FLA. Kohn said group members plan to meet again before the end of the semester to convince the university to join the WRC.
Gustafson said that since Russell Athletic had agreed to re-open the factory, SCALE did not see the need for immediate investigations, but she did say that the group will continue to work with USAS and WRC to ensure that Russell follows through on its commitments.
After having made some headway in the Russell Athletic case, SCALE now wants to focus its efforts on the needs of USC workers on campus.
“In addition to the campaign to have USC join the WRC, SCALE is interested in building the relationships between students and workers,” Gustafson said. “Workers at USC feel they work for students on campus, and we want them to feel open coming to SCALE and asking for our support.”
The organization is planning to campaign for tuition remission for the children of janitors on campus, who work for USC’s subcontractor Aramark.
It also plans to accompany the workers on regular delegations and meetings with the USC administration to ensure the university maintains its fair labor practices.
Although he was thrilled with Russell Athletic’s decision to rehire the workers, Kohn said SCALE needs to continue its fight for laborers’ rights.
“One success isn’t a reason to stop fighting for more,” Kohn said.

USC does have free counseling services though, and they might be able to help you find some basic human emotions, like concern for other people.
But if not, the annual Fascist March is taking place in Singapore and you three might like that.

The streak continues.
In the Daily Trojan‘s annual flag football game against the Daily Bruin — termed the Blood Bowl — the Daily Trojan came out on top in a wild finish Friday on the slippery Intramural Field, bringing the Daily Trojan‘s winning streak in the series to a commanding 11 games.
Down 38-32 with less than four minutes to play, quarterback Grant Tunkel led the Daily Trojan down the field on a series of short passes. Once on the goaline, the Daily Bruin defense tightened up, stopping the Daily Trojan on three consecutive downs.
The Daily Trojan called timeout with five seconds remaining to draw up one final play. Tunkel evaded the pressure and found receiver Josh Jovanelly, who dove and made the catch in the left corner of the end zone for the game-tying score.
On the point after, receiver Dave Dulberg caught Tunkel’s pass to seal the 39-38 win for the Daily Trojan and save the streak.
The large contingent of Daily Trojan staff rushed the field to celebrate perhaps one of the greatest Blood Bowl victories in history. Some of the Daily Bruin players were reportedly seen weeping after the devastating loss.
Hey everyone,
Let me congratulate you on that HUGE victory. Hate to date myself, but I remember breaking a long losing streak to the Daily Bruin back in 1996 in the first battle of the wiffle ball bats (doubt you guys still do that today). Anyway, you will treasure this win forever. In fact, somebody asked me about it at the game Saturday at the Coliseum and the next thing you know, about 10 people stopped watching the game and were listening to hold court about our come from behind win. (Granted the game was rather boring).
Perhaps the best moment, besides celebrating with fellow staffers, was coming back to campus and telling Mona about it. Watching her face light up was the best.
Again, congratulations on keeping the tradition alive and putting your stamp on this legacy!

Playing out of rhythm and with a limited bench, the USC men’s basketball team saw a 12-point second-half lead slip away against Loyola Marymount on Saturday and lost 67-59 in its second game of the season.
Following a season-opening victory against UC Riverside, the Trojans (1-1) looked sluggish to start the game against the Lions (2-3) and fell behind early.

Having lost a large contingent of starters from last season, offensive cohesiveness was a concern, but in its dominating wire-to-wire victory over UC Riverside the team’s coordination was a non-issue.
On Saturday, however, the team’s inexperience and lack of depth was exposed as the Trojans fell behind 16-8 early. Led by forward Drew Viney and guard Jarred DuBois, the Lions were able to get open looks on the offensive end.
LMU also limited the Trojans’ go-to option, senior forward Dwight Lewis, who was held to four points in the first half.
After more than 10 minutes had elapsed in the first half, the Trojans finally found their rhythm on the floor and went on a run that put them up eight points heading into halftime.
Point guard Donte Smith led the charge late in the first half in the redshirt junior’s second career start at the position. His nine points on four-of-seven shooting were key in helping the Trojans rebound from their early funk.
Coming out of the break, the Trojans looked like they were headed toward another double-digit victory, especially after sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic’s dunk with 17:09 remaining in the game put the Trojans up a dozen on the suddenly tame Lions.
But after senior guard Dwight Lewis missed a corner 3-pointer that would have put the Trojans up 14 clanked off the side of the rim and redshirt junior forward Kasey Cunningham went down with an apparent leg injury, the flow of the game began to turn.
Smith, who was so integral to the Trojan’s success early in the game, saw his opportunities disappear as the Lion defense locked down on the point guard. Smith was unable to make a single field goal in the second half.
USC coach Kevin O’Neill blamed the second-half letdown not only on increased pressure from LMU, but on fatigue as well.
“They hounded Donte and he caved under pressure a little bit,” O’Neill said. “When you get tired and you haven’t played those kinds of minutes before, you get tired quicker.”
Loyola Marymount took advantage of the suddenly quiet Trojan offense and went on a 16-4 run, turning an eight-point Trojan lead into a four-point deficit.
Vucevic, who finished the game with career highs in points and rebounds, helped the Trojans tie the game at 54, converting a layup and then ripping away a rebound off a Lion miss to set up junior guard Marcus Simmons, who drew a foul and sank the free throws.
The Trojans were never able to claim the lead, however, as the Lions went on another run, outscoring USC in the final minutes 13-5 and closing out the victory.
“We had a chance to put the game in our control,” O’Neill said. “We kind of caved in a little bit.”
With a chance at starting the season 2-0 squandered, O’Neill was still mildly pleased with the effort put in by his depleted roster.
“Our guys played hard, we just didn’t do enough to win the game, and defensively we had a letdown near the end of the game,” O’Neill said. “You just can’t let that happen.”

Coming into the weekend with only one Pac-10 road win all year, the No. 15 USC women’s volleyball team had something to prove in its last two away matches of the season.
The Women of Troy did just that.
Killer setup · Setter Kendall Bateman (12) had 40 assists against the Ducks on Saturday to lead USC. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
Behind the strong play of their middles and a solid defensive attack, the Women of Troy swept away both No. 18 Oregon and Oregon State at the Galen Center to show the rest of the conference that USC might just be peaking at the right time.
“These wins were pretty big, especially because we played extremely well,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “We have self-confidence. We’re more physical and we’re focused.”
Led by junior middle blocker Audrey Eichler and senior outside hitter Jessica Gysin, USC (19-9, 8-8) swept the Beavers 3-0 (25-21, 25-19, 25-17) Saturday to finish its weekend sweep.
Eichler and Gysin both had 13 kills to lead the team against the Beavers. Eichler and fellow middle blocker sophomore Lauren Williams provided a dominant effort for the Women of Troy, as they played strong in the middle to help set up USC’s defensive attack. Williams hit .667 on the evening with nine kills.
“Eichler is not as powerful as Williams, but she is an excellent blocker and continues to improve her offense. Williams is really physical,” Haley said. “When they play well, that just puts so much pressure on the teams that are big outside hitting teams.”
Sophomore setter Kendall Bateman produced another consistent effort with 40 assists and five digs while outside hitter Alex Jupiter recorded a double-double with 11 kills and 10 digs to go with four blocks (three solo).
Jill Sawatzky and Rachel Rourke had 10 kills each for Oregon State (12-16, 3-13).
The sweep was the second in two days for the Women of Troy as they defeated the Ducks 3-0, (25-22, 25-18, 25-19) Friday night behind the strong play of Jupiter.
The sophomore racked up 22 kills, 12 digs and four blocks to lead her team to its first win in Eugene, Ore., since 2006.
Bateman, who leads the nation in assists per set, set the pace for the USC offense with 40 assists, five digs and three block assists. Williams had eight kills to go with seven blocks (one solo, six assisted), and Gysin added eight kills and eight blocks.
Katherine Fischer and Heather Meyers had 11 kills each for Oregon (16-9, 6-9), but Meyers had 11 hitting errors on the night.
Jupiter started a key run in the first set at 17-17 as USC scored four straight for the eventual win.  Williams and Jupiter stuffed a Meyers kill attempt in the second set to make it 13-10 and would close out with the 12-8 run.
Gysin’s kill broke a 14-14 tie in the third set, setting up a 20-16 lead to finish the sweep of the Ducks.
“We’ve upped our game,” Haley said. “From the second week of October, we’ve gotten better every week. I was really impressed with our blocking and our defense, and Bateman is really the real deal. If she’s not the best [setter] in the country, she’s certainly one of the two or three best.”
USC, riding a four-match winning streak, concludes its season this weekend when it hosts Arizona and Arizona State at the Galen Center. Following the matches, the NCAA selection committee will draw tournament positions on Sunday.
Your headline was final two road games which are matches or sets, then you have these contests at the Galen Center so please do your homework.

The senior class delivered on Senior Day at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, handily defeating UC Irvine 15-9 on Saturday and helping the USC men’s water polo team complete a fifth straight undefeated home record.
Yet, for all the gratification of their final regular season victory, the No. 1 Trojans (22-1, 8-0) know they have bigger games in the not-too-distant future.
Senior salute · Two-meter Jordan Thompson and the rest of the USC seniors have never lost a game at McDonald’s Swim Stadium. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
“This victory is a moot point to us,” senior two-meter J.W. Krumpholz said. “We have three much more important games coming up next week at MPSF.”
Winning the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament would mean an automatic berth in the NCAA Championships. The Trojans used Saturday’s contest against the No. 7 Anteaters (15-11, 3-5) to prepare and iron out some of the wrinkles exposed in their overtime victory against Stanford last weekend.
Having already clinched the MPSF tournament’s top ranking, the Trojans were able to play a squad of mainly seniors, and the group got out to a fast start.
Sprinting out to five goals in the first quarter, senior two-meters Jordan Thompson and Krumpholz both contributed goals in the first period to help the Trojans take a 5-2 lead at the game’s first break.
Led by senior driver Justin Rappel’s two goals, the Trojans came out for the second period just as hot as they were to open the game ­— and scored five more — racing out to a 10-4 lead that the team would not look back from.
Both teams locked down on defense after the halftime break, as the Trojans were only able to convert scoring opportunities when playing with a man-up advantage, an area in which the Trojans have been strong all year.
“Getting two-meter opportunities and earning ejections are both very important for us,” sophomore driver Peter Kurzeka said. “Six-on-five is our strongest area, along with our counterattack offense.”
Kurzeka would finish the game with a hat trick.
By the time the fourth quarter rolled around, the Trojans were up a commanding seven goals, allowing some of the other seniors to get opportunities to contribute as their regular season careers came to an end.
The seniors and backups continued the team’s strong performance, giving up just three goals and scoring two, including redshirt freshman two-meter Brian Boswell’s score from up close midway through the final period.
Although the Trojans were able to win by six goals, the nine goals scored by the Anteaters were still too many in the Trojans’ point of view.
“Our offense was connecting today, but on defense, we’re still not exactly where we want to be — to hold teams to four goals or less,” Kurzeka said.

The shock of last week’s embarrassing 34-point loss to Stanford has had a week to sink in.
The Trojan faithful want to forget about that game and move on to a new one. But I’m not talking about UCLA, the Trojans’ next opponent.
Hot seat · Trojan fans are not satisfied with playcaller Jeremy Bates (center), but finding one person to blame is not so easy in football. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The Trojans’ biggest opponent right now is the blame game. Because people want answers.
With a week to rant and rave about every aspect that has gone wrong this season for the usually dominant USC football team, it has become ugly.
When a team that has been the standard of college football excellence for the entire decade starts falling apart, fans need a scapegoat. In the case of the Trojans, fans are taking shots at everybody, whether the complaints are justified or not.
Already, people are calling for first-year playcaller Jeremy Bates’ head. For all the complaining Trojan fans did about former offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian last season, they’d probably do anything to have him back now.
Bates isn’t creative, people whine. Bates is too NFL. Bates is too conservative.
Last time I checked, USC had given up a combined 102 points in its last two lopsided defeats. Unless I wasn’t notified, Bates didn’t switch to defensive coordinator those games.
Then it must be defensive coordinator Rocky Seto’s fault, right? He’s the one that ravenous fans can hang in effigy.
But isn’t he running the same schemes that USC has been running throughout its dominant decade? Aren’t they the same ones defense-first coach Pete Carroll engineered and has complete control over?
Seto shouldn’t be held accountable then. He’s not inventing new defensive schemes every week. He’s sticking to the book, doing the same things that got USC to the golden pedestal it was just dethroned from.
Bates is in the same boat. Even though he is in his first year with the Trojans, he’s still running the same offense that Sarkisian ran before him, and Lane Kiffin before that.
It must be the players then, right? The best guys must not be getting playing time. Yet the field is still packed with blue-chip recruits from all over the country and the top recruiting classes keep coming in year after year.
But still, fans want heads to roll.
Maybe it’s human nature. When things go wrong, it’s natural to want to know why.
But when it comes to football, arguably more than any other sport, there’s never a simple answer.
As much as people may want to point to one reason and say, “If we do x, then everything will be back to normal,” it just never works that way.
Plus, when the Trojans are losing games by more than three touchdowns, a different play call here or there wouldn’t have made the least bit of difference.
Football is the consummate team sport. From all levels of the coaching staff and the depth chart, everyone contributes. And everyone must be on the same page for football team to run smoothly.
We saw firsthand Saturday how easily that can change from week to week. Stanford looked like it could win the national title based on the way it came into the Coliseum and crushed USC last week.
One week later, it all came crashing down against Cal.
That is just the nature of the game. Stanford found out what USC has been accustomed to for some time now: It’s hard to keep all those elements together week in and week out.
But fans have a hard time understanding that. We’d rather start a website promoting the firing of our coach the second things go wrong than give him time to work out the kinks.
Maybe Carroll will fire some of his staff this offseason. Maybe some duties will be reassigned. Maybe he’ll take back more control.
Or maybe he’ll leave it all alone. The pieces are all there for the Trojans, they just need to come together. One new coach or one new player is not going to change that.
As much as fans may want to find the one cancer that is causing USC to become mortal again, they won’t. The Trojans are all in this together.
So if you’re going to point fingers at who’s really to blame for USC’s recent troubles, you’re going to need a lot more hands.

Finger pointing is natural when things go wrong but sucess starts at the top with coaches. In the case of business, the top means Managers. Because so many key coaches were stolen by Stark and many retained the same title and responsibilities when transferring to Washington, it probably came down to more money. If this were the case, USC football revenue brings in so much revenue with TV and Merchandising, there shouldn’t have been a problem with giving these guys significant raises. Hopefully SC tried to retained them with  counter-offers. Secondly, players should share in the responsibilities. Given the right direction by the coaches, coaches can’t play the game for them. They can only guide them. Nonetheless, football is a complex game but given the four and five star talent, we should do better. With USC football, there is no such thing as a rebuilding year. The fans and alumni can’t wait. Because Pete gets the big bucks, now is the time he’s got to be creative. I support him because we haven’t had a run like this since McKay and Robinson. Fight on against UCLA.
Trojans be proud – If a team whoops ass somewhere, and then gets his ass whooped someplace else, it means the teams are getting better. Lets just hope the same way we whoop our pac-10 asses, we can whoop some SEC / big 12 butts. Then the BCS rankings will take us more seriously.
For now, lets campaign for a playoff system. All that is needed is enough money to sweeten the deal.
Trojan fans!! Let’s give thanks for all the PAC 10 championships, the National Championships, BCS Bowl games,
and Heisman winners.  Thank you Coach Carroll for all those wonderful years!  We support you and let’s FIGHT ON!! From a true TROJAN FAMILY!! GOOOOOOOOOO SC!
Nice. I’ve definitely heard way too much of, “If only we just _____ we would be going for triple championships again!” or some crap.  Of course there are issues to work through, but I’m even slow to say we need to jump on things and do a whole lot of fixing.
I’m convinced that football programs just go through cycles; Oklahoma’s had a much harder fall from glory this year, and that’s probably due to Bradford being out a bunch, but our problems are similarly just something to work through. S*** happens. We have these first-year coordinators on either side of the ball, as well as a freshman quarterback whose only real issue is getting spooked and throwing interceptions. Nothin’ a little experience won’t help.
I’m willing to let things pull together next year. We’re in a growing time of the cycle, and the best thing to do would be to fight on, stick by our team, and see them back into the very upper echelons of college football.
…so, advice? Don’t empty the Coliseum out in the 4th quarter. Am I allowed to blame the fans more than anything the team has done?
Couldn’t have said it better myself.  Real fans DO NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE END OF THE GAME!  We are the 12th man – didn’t anybody teach you people anything?  Stand by your team, win or lose.  Fight on!

Fans at the Galen Center who are usually cheering for the Trojans on the basketball court sang a different tune Thursday night — one that included lyrics from The Fray’s music.
As The Fray opened its second show at USC with “You Found Me,” the most well-known song from the self-titled sophomore album the group released in February, the audience had no trouble showing excitement over the piano-driven rock band’s return to campus. All it took was a “Come on Trojans, on your feet” from one of the The Fray’s lead vocalists, Isaac Slade.
Frayed not · Joe King of The Fray perform at the Galen Center Thursday. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
After opener Dose of Adolescence’s over-the-top rock style — the kind in which you can’t understand a single word the lead vocalist is singing or, rather, yelling — it is no surprise that the audience was eager to take in The Fray’s much subtler, more captivating musical talents.
Playing a mix of songs from its first and second albums, the band demonstrated that not only does its music have the ability to sell records, but it can also translate into an enthralling live performance.
While some artists use elaborate backdrops, costumes or movement onstage to capture the audience’s attention, The Fray played against a plain black curtain on a makeshift stage.
Aside from a few instances where intriguing lighting was used, it was the simple combination of Slade and guitarist Joe King’s mesmerizing voices and the instruments that all four band members skillfully play that kept all eyes and ears in the arena entranced.
Especially captivating were the songs that brought out the purity of Slade and King’s voices by placing them against the accompaniment of a single instrument or a simple instrumental backing, as was the case in “Happiness,” which Slade sang with both passion and perfection.
As Slade and King alternated between singing and playing the guitar and piano, while Ben Wysocki and Dave Welsh accompanied them on the drums and guitar respectively, the group’s love for music radiated endlessly throughout the arena.
The Fray’s inevitable inclusion of “How to Save a Life,” the song for which its first album was named, took the level of audience engagement and interaction to a new height.
Because it was obvious that nearly everyone in the crowd knew every word to the chart-topping song, Slade held out his microphone at the end, allowing the many voices that filled the sold-out arena to finish the song for the band members — a reminder of just how big the band that decided to come back and play another small show at USC had become.
Amid outstanding live renditions of many of its own songs, the foursome included in its repertoire a cover of Kanye West’s “Heartless,” a rendition the band recently recorded that is arguably better suited to the song’s message than the original.
The Fray’s only fault in its Thursday night show at the Galen Center was that the band wasn’t on stage long enough — or at least, that is how it felt. The hour the band did spend on stage, however, was jam-packed with flawless, heartfelt performances.
Among the three songs in The Fray’s  encore was the slower “Never Say Never,” which was performed with such vigor that it could have served as the show’s conclusion.
But the show closed on a more upbeat note with the band’s widely known “Over My Head (Cable Car),” which had the entire audience back on its feet and animatedly singing along.
If anyone in the audience wasn’t already a fan of The Fray, the show opened their eyes and ears to the great aptitude that the group holds. To be able to perform songs that you’ve played countless times with the same level of passion and perseverance as if it were for the first time, as The Fray did on Thursday night, is the mark of a truly talented group of musicians.

Hip-hop isn’t just about the moves; it’s about the attitude and passion. You’ve got to bring it to the audience, so it too will sway along to the beat as you pop, lock and break every joint and limb.
And  did USC’s Hip-Hop Showcase bring it.
Pop and lock · The acts at USC’s Hip-Hop Showcase on Friday ranged from break dancing to lyrical hip-hop. - Amaresh Sundaram Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan
Break Through, USC’s premier hip-hop dance organization, presented its fifth biannual dance production on Friday in Bovard Auditorium with four guest performers: Vanguards Crew, Chaotic 3, iGroove and USC Fly Girls. Together with rapper and poet Marc Payne as the emcee, the performance attracted many students to the packed auditorium.
The show began with an introduction video showing the Break Through team during its rehearsals, revealing to the audience how much hard work the members put into this performance.
The showcase was then divided into 20 segments, 16 of them performed by Break Through.
Guest choreographers Jackie Shentu and David Yi, professional dancers who teach classes for Team Millennia Performing Arts, contributed to three dances. But for the rest of the acts, it was fair game for any member to contribute in whatever way they could.
Simply defined, hip-hop dancing is the grittier version of cheerleading. While cheerleaders draw on the audience’s delight and camaraderie to cheer for a sports team, hip-hop dancers rile the audience’s rebellious spirit.
Because this was a showcase of hip-hop, there was no specific theme or style. Some of the dances were fast-paced with a lot of funk-inspired movements, particularly popping — a technique in which the dancer contracts and relaxes muscles in a jerky movement that causes a controlled spasm throughout the body. Sometimes these pops were sudden and static; other times, they were smooth and fluid.
The first dance was classic hip-hop, with the dancers divided into two teams jeering at each other. Occasionally there were gymnastics stunts like back flips, handsprings and round-offs, but mostly there was hair flipping and hoodies as the music blared.
But hip-hop has a softer side, too. Some of the songs played were ballads, in which the dancers swayed gracefully to the music, with a hint of sexual suggestion.
In the dance “I Saw That Going Differently,” the female dancers wore short black dresses and spiky high heels, while the male dancers were bare-chested except for a loose vest, which they later stripped off. In another sensuous dance, “Set The Mood,” six dancers dressed smartly with fashionable hats and clicked their fingers to jazzy moves to the tune of Justin Timberlake’s “Set The Mood Right.”
Another unique dance, a lyrical hip-hop, used creative, graceful and ballet-inspired moves as the dancers untwined, careened and floated with smooth, fluid movements.
The showcase was highly entertaining, which was obvious by the wild screams, whistles and cheering from the audience.
“[The show] was absolutely fantastic,” said Geoffrey Lin, a freshman majoring in accounting and contributing choreographer for the show. “Being on stage with everyone, I felt the energy coming off from each and every one of us. We definitely did better than we did on any of the rehearsals.”
The USC Hip-Hop Showcase proved that the art form isn’t just fixed on a specific style or attitude, but is composed of an eclectic and dynamic mix of flowing trends and styles.
Friday night’s performance displayed a great showcase of it all, with an infectious attitude that no doubt left the audience grooving a little on its way out.
But man, the kid could use a cheeseburger.  I mean eat something!
Agreed…he stood out against everyone else and took everyone’s focus when he was onstage…his choreography is also on another level and any dancer would be lucky to work with him.
It is obvious Ms. Lee was not there!
anyone who was there saw Sam Allen steal the show and was far and away the best performer up there!

Since the advent of Facebook, the term “creeping” has become rather mainstream. For all you non-stalker types, Facebook creeping generally involves adding someone as a friend, browsing all 863 of their tagged photos, committing their favorite quotes to memory and then performing an advanced Google search on anyone you suspect could have been his or her ex.
But long before Al Gore and the Internet, the same fundamental skills of Facebook creeping applied to real-world interactions — on the playground, in line at your neighborhood Dairy Queen, and, of course, at the office.
Some modern-day creepers opt to kick it old school with the in-person approach, while others prefer creeping from the privacy of their home computers.
My very own in-office creeper was the facilities clerk, Pinkie. Pinkie was an unabashed creeper — a sort of no-holds-barred type — with agoraphobic tendencies, slimy pink fingers and the wardrobe of a stagehand.
One day, out of sheer boredom and minimal curiosity, I asked him how to pronounce his German surname.
His response? “You can pronounce it any way you’d like when we’re married.” Thanks, but no thanks.
But his creeping didn’t stop there. When those oh-so-subtle advances proved unsuccessful, he decided to take it up a notch.
I took a long beach weekend for the Fourth of July holiday, during which I came across a Cosmopolitan article warning readers of real-life stalkers who, after barely knowing a girl, would threaten to kill her if she so much as politely declined an invitation to hang out with them.
When I returned to work, I had plenty of copy jobs waiting for me. As I watched each page slide in and out of the machine, I began reflecting on the Cosmo article. As I recalled each horrifying detail about the twisted stalker mind, Pinkie snuck up behind me and whispered, “I missed you while you were gone … and not just because of work stuff.”
Let it be known, I missed one day of work. One.
Even though that exchange scared the living hell out of me, I’m not in a position to give Pinkie a lot of flack for his creeper tendencies. After all, the man taught me everything I know about what it takes to be an office creeper.
My first summer working at the law firm, one charming, though married, attorney was the target of all my stalking efforts. From here on, I will refer to this man as “Sexy Can I” after the Ray J hit single I listened to everyday on my morning commute.
On my last day at the office, he sent me a one-line email thanking me for all my hard work and wishing me luck at school.
Before heading out for good, I waited until no one was near the printing station and printed out his message, which to this day hangs proudly in my apartment bedroom.
When I got home, face wet with the tears of lunacy, I immediately opened my laptop and got down to business.
After performing an advanced Google search, I saw his name was listed on Classmates.com but realized I couldn’t gather any more information unless I was a member of the site. I was starving for information and thus, did not hesitate in creating an account under the alias “Sameer Patel.”
Even with a membership, none of the listed information would satisfy a full-fledged creeper like myself so I returned to the tried-and-true Google search.
That is when I stumbled upon a true creeping gem: an entire website created by and devoted to him and his wife. Suddenly, there were hundreds of pictures at my disposal — some I wanted to see (him tanned and smiling on his boat) and others (him in a mortarboard cap, swim trunks, marching band uniform or any combination thereof) I wish I hadn’t.
But in the end, it was this seemingly unhealthy behavior that helped me get over my massive, and unattainable, crush on a man 11 years my senior. Knowing that I had access to hundreds of pictures of him at any given moment finally allowed me to stop my frenzied search.
The truth is, everyone creeps — just to varying degrees. A mild creeper might look you up in the White Pages, but would never have the courage to call. A full-blown creeper would move into your apartment complex, memorize your laundry schedule and somehow always end up removing and folding your unmentionables in order to use the dryer (even when there are four others not in use).
But creeping is not a choice as much as it as a curiosity-driven human instinct. Because we’re all guilty at one point or another, the best thing we can do is laugh it off as long as it’s within the limits of the law.
In the case of schoolgirl crush v. psychotic stalker, it is the judgment of this column that you should you choose to creep, your methods must be kept stealthy. Let’s hope my co-workers don’t perform a Google search on me — if they do, the first link will lead them to this incriminating column.

In a crowded coffee shop, an unassuming microphone stands alone on stage.
As 20-somethings huddle in groups, others sit isolated, sipping espressos and reading paperbacks. The lights suddenly dim, chatter stops and music begins to play.
Young Kim | Daily Trojan
Two female students take the stage and perform an original song. Next, a male student sits on a stool and plays the guitar.
The evening continues with a piano piece followed by a comedian and a poet.
No, this isn’t a night at a trendy Silver Lake, Calif. hangout, but just another successful Open Mic Night at Ground Zero Performance Café.
Every Monday night, Ground Zero, the on-campus coffee shop that resembles an underground club with its black walls and plush couches, is taken over by performers of all kinds.
At 9:30 p.m. the show begins and performers take the stage for slots of seven minutes each. The performances include guitarists, singers, pianists, comedians and poets. Some weeks it is all regulars, other weeks there is a new group of performers. There are a few non-USC performers who come for the atmosphere and to test new material. Students, however, make up the majority of the audience and performers.
“It’s really interesting to see the way other students express themselves,” said Wesley Fulkerson, a freshman majoring in business administration.
Open Mic Night draws regular performers because of its amiable environment and receptive crowd.
“It’s a really good place for people to hang out and show their talents,” said Arielle Oh, a sophomore majoring in fine arts and the organizer of Open Mic Night. “Overall, the whole thing is really welcoming, there’s no pressure.”
Open Mic Night has shown that USC has a lot of talented people who love to perform, as these students come back every week to try out their material.
“I really love to write and I wanted to get an audience’s reaction,”  Fulkerson said.
Other students perform either on a whim or to settle a bet, which can lead to a range of reactions — everything from cheers to boos — from the audience.
“Sometimes in college you need to do something you wouldn’t do otherwise. So, I just went for it,” said Pierre Tasci, a student comedian majoring in computer engineering and computer science.
Students are not the only performers that grace the stage; each week, non-USC performers come and hope that there will be room on the list to perform their material. These aspiring entertainers sometimes get applause, but are usually received with an awkward silence.
Despite the audience’s reaction, Ground Zero is able to attract a wide variety of musicians and serve all its performers and their needs.
“Out of all the coffeehouse venues, it has the best stage equipment and is just a good environment for a performer,” Oh said.
And the rules of this coffeehouse aren’t like most coffeehouses around. Ground Zero allows its performers a great deal of freedom. Each performer has seven minutes to perform anything he or she wants to.
“We have basic house rules; you just have to have a shirt on,” Oh said. “There were kids who lost a bet and they had to sing a cover of The Fray song. During the song, they took their shirts off. It was really awkward.”
With this carefree attitude it is no surprise that Open Mic Night has had its fair share of outrageous and unexpected performances. Last week, for example, a young boy took the stage and told his life story in seven minutes.
No matter what the people perform or who is performing, an audience of 70 to 80 people fills Ground Zero on Monday nights from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. With a full house, performers come and try to impress the audience and their friends, hoping to gain a following and further themselves in the music world.
After many performances, students and professionals alike plug their name and a website to follow them and their careers.
Although there are a few students who step up to the mic just for fun, most are practicing in hopes of making a living off their talents.
“I like the whole experience — it’s a good way to build confidence and gain experience,” Fulkerson said.
Although Ground Zero is known for its out-of-this-world milkshakes, Open Mic Night deserves the same hype. Each performance is different from the next, and the entertainment is endless.
The next time you go to Ground Zero on a Monday night for a milkshake, you might think about staying for Open Mic Night.

Hugo Chavez is looking for attention again.
The Venezuelan president is known for his frequent politically charged outbursts, which in the past have included calling George W. Bush “the devil” and touting socialism as the true path to economic success.
Since President Barack Obama’s election, Chavez has taken a much warmer attitude toward the United States. Still, his most recent comments in a speech to international socialist politicians last week show that, ideologically, the two nations remain very far apart.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
According to the BBC, Chavez lauded Venezuelan Ilich Ramirez Sanchez — nicknamed “Carlos the Jackal” — as a “revolutionary fighter.” Sanchez was the mastermind of a series of terrorist activities in the 1970s, which included deadly bombings, assassinations and hostage situations. He is currently serving a life sentence in France, where he was jailed in 1994 for killing two French intelligence officers and an alleged informer.
Chavez is obviously not worried about enraging the French, despite the fact that French companies buy significant amounts of Venezuelan oil every year.
Granted, Chavez doesn’t need to worry too much about the consequences of his words — mainly because there won’t be any. As one of largest petroleum exporters in the world, Venezuela has an economic stronghold over every country that depends upon it for energy resources.
Whether they like Chavez or not, Western leaders are going to have to maintain diplomatic ties with Caracas; after all, we’re not really in any position to go overthrowing any more unfriendly dictators.
This is yet another example of the detriments of relying on foreign oil. It compels us to keep silent.
But Chavez’s enthusiasm for dictators and political dissidents is not to be contained. In the speech, he went on to hail President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe as a brother and he bestowed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran with the same fraternal moniker.
Since Mugabe’s election in Zimbabwe, another kingpin in the foreign oil tug of war, that country has fallen into a cycle of corruption, economic stagnation and national bankruptcy. The AIDS epidemic, drought and food crisis in recent years have left Mugabe’s government with one of the worst track records in modern history.
One would think that this is hardly the type of individual with whom a leader should claim national brotherhood.
And who could forget Ahmadinejad’s recent speech at the United Nations, which lambasted capitalism and ran the gamut of controversial issues, from critiques of American foreign policy to the conflict in Palestine?
For someone who claims to want to repair relations with the United States, Chavez certainly hasn’t thought his friendships through.
At least there was some logic to the Ahmadinejad reference. The two countries share membership in Organization of Petroleum Supporting Countries, and Chavez has some interest in vocalizing a commitment to positive relations.
Chavez has always shown himself to be bombastic, and many times, foreign policy simply comes down to the individual’s personality.
Nevertheless, he did mention that he realized his comments would not be well received in Europe, particularly on the issue of Carlos the Jackal. It seems as if he can’t miss a chance to irk Western capitalists.
If the United States needed one more reason to end foreign oil dependence, it has found one in the self-aggrandizing Venezuelan leader.
Chavez knows he can say what he wants, without consequences or repercussions. At the end of the day, oil speaks louder than words.
Rosaleen O’Sullivan is a junior majoring in English and international relations. Her column, “Global Grind,” runs Mondays.
I’d probably put oil in as just one of his many tools for asserting his identity internationally (as immature as it comes across). He’s pulling stunts like North Korea, jumping up and down and just yelling “Look at me!” I mean, Mugabe, rebels, and Ahmadinijad? He’s not particularly good at finding ideologically-consistent men to worship.  North Korea has it’s ballistic missile tests, and Chavez has his oil, but both of them have the same tendency to grandstand and throw some tantrums.
Mrs Rosaleen O’Sullivan, you failed to frame the real context of these words. The settlement of 7 brand new military bases form US into neighbouring Colombia with fire capacity to drop nuclear attacks, and quick deploy of forces almost any corner of South America, plus state of the art spy equipments, made the weigh of his words quite different. He is calling for attention into the big trouble created by US with a permanent threat over any sovereign government that decide to turn self-centred, out of  alienating US gravity. The reason is to highlight the fact that before US + Europe strike against any country, they need to vilify the enemy, and that is what is going on with Venezuela. Chavez questions is: Are all the bad guys really bad? or are they western convenient exaggerations to keep the justification to undermine their governments. Perhaps, we’ll never know for sure but the evidence point into clear possibilities. What is obvious in the last years, a huge media campaign that is running like a circus to soften the idea that Chavez is so terrible that have to disappear. And that is against the very core value of our modern civilization of sovereign democracies, much more important than the oil market.

The City of Angels celebrated a paltry victory on Thursday when the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations released its annual Hate Crime Report.
The findings demonstrated a 4 percent overall drop in hate crimes in the Los Angeles County area, but found that hate crimes against the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community increased by 21 percent. The report also found that hate crimes against members of the GLBT community tended to be more violent than hate crimes driven by religion or race.
The report links the increase in part to the passage of Proposition 8, the contentious ballot measure that outlawed same-sex marriage in California.
But ultimately this pattern of discrimination is not a new development. The statistics put a number on what has been a visible swell in hate crimes against the GLBT community in the past few years. The Oxnard, Calif. shooting of an openly gay student in February of 2008 is just one example of the statewide problem.
Other commendable federal and statewide strides have been made to decrease discrimination — including the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which endured more than a decade of revisions before it was successfully pushed through the House and Senate in October.
But though federal legislation is important, the issue of hate crimes shouldn’t be tackled retroactively. The best place to introduce a strong message of nondiscrimination is in the Los Angeles County public school system.
All schools already support anti-discrimination policies, but administrators should make a concerted effort to create programs that cement these laws into the student mindset. Student organizations like Gay-Straight Alliances are good way to foster a nondiscriminatory attitude.
There’s not denying that money is tight for California public schools, but the statistics reveal a need for action. Let’s start from the bottom up.

This article is weak and ineffectual. Sorry.
Maybe we should just oppose “crimes” instead of deciding that their importance depends on what privileged class the victim falls into.
