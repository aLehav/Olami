Four USC professors discussed immigration and the implications of current rhetoric on the issue for immigrants in a panel hosted by USC Dornsife on Friday.
Alexandra Ting | Daily TrojanTear down that wall · Assistant Professor at the USC Gould School of Law Emily Ryo argued against Donald Trump’s immigration plan.
The panel, part of the Fall 2016 USC Dornsife Thematic Semester program, featured Sol Price School of Public Policy Professor Dowell Myers, Dornsife College Professor Manuel Pastor, Gould School of Law Associate Professor Emily Ryo and Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism Professor Roberto Suro. It was open to students and staff alike and was held in the Mark Taper Hall of Humanities.
The USC Dornsife Thematic Semester program is a series of panels each week discussing a different aspect of law and politics. Its goal is to educate students on the facts and figures behind government actions and policies. The current program theme is Electoral Commons, which  features weekly panels pertaining to the presidential election.
“My hope is that this panel is a starting point for students to really think about these issues of immigration, specifically how it pertains to the upcoming election,” Ryo said. “An hour is not long enough to give a nuanced understanding of the whole issue, but it will be enough to get students to start thinking more critically about the election as a whole.”
The four professors took six minutes each to focus on one aspect of the immigration issue and concluded the panel with a 30-minute question-and-answer session. Some of the topics discussed included the potential enforcement of Republican Party Nominee Donald Trump’s proposed wall, the economic ramifications of mass deportation, the process of naturalization and the public opinion on immigration.
As to why immigration is a topic USC students should better understand in the upcoming election, Ryo stated that it was an issue of personal importance.
“We have 11.3 million undocumented immigrants. But that’s not counting legal immigrants, many of whom are making up a huge segment of our working population. These legal immigrants are our neighbors, our friends. They’re in our own school — they’re not a separate population, but they’re part of our own lives,” Ryo said. “As these people impact our personal lives and networks, this issue should be something of personal interest to students.”
For Myers, the public discussion about immigration has become less about the issue and more about political power.
“I think immigration is a sideshow in this election because it’s been turned into an attention-getter by the losing candidate — but we don’t actually know what his real policies are,” Myers said. “For immigration especially, it’s important for USC students to understand this issue because they read about it in the newspaper and hear the campaign rhetoric, and it’s not enough to inform them. They need hard data to better see through the smoke screens in this election.”
Kurt Weatherford, a freshman majoring in international relations and the global economy, Weatherford commented on the importance of such programs.
“I thought it was amazing to be in the presence of such knowledgeable faculty that I don’t think would be available in a lot of spaces, but at USC, it’s nice to have access to this,” Weatherford said.
Following the panel, several students and staff members raised questions of their own to gain a better knowledge on topics of their specific interest; some included the legal protections illegal immigrants have against workplace abuse, the details of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s “comprehensive immigration reform” policy, what might happen to immigrant-heavy sectors without immigrant workers and the outlook on the U.S. population in the next two decades.
“As far as who I’m going to vote for, this panel didn’t change my views, but it did change my viewpoint in the sense that I became more educated on the issue of immigration in specific,” Weatherford said. “It also allowed me to understand a different perspective of the election.”

Located in the San Bernardino Mountains, USC’s Camp Kesem helps give children with parents who have cancer the chance to be children.
This August, Camp Kesem’s fourth year in operation, the camp hosted 20 more campers than the year before.
The Camp Kesem mission is “to support children through and beyond their parent’s cancer with innovative, fun-filled programs that foster a lasting community.” The organization was started in 2000 at Stanford University and now has over 80 chapters in 38 states across the country.
The USC chapter of Camp Kesem was founded in 2013. The camp supports children in the Southern California community by providing a week-long summer camp experience. It also gives campers year-long peer support, even after summer’s end.
The Camp Kesem chapter of USC is an entirely student-run organization, from fundraising to camp counselors to staff. Students raise money annually to cover the cost of camp so that every child can attend for free.
“We want them to enjoy it without the financial struggles because they’re already going through a lot at home,” said Ryan Cenicola, a sophomore undeclared major and Camp Kesem counselor.
The Camp Kesem organization reports that over 3 million children are affected by their parent’s cancer, highlighting the need for more support for the children. USC’s Camp Kesem serves 75 students annually. This year, the organization raised $65,000 to cover costs. Staffers say they hope to expand their outreach to serve more campers and eventually raise enough funds to host two camps each summer.
“[We] have been supporting children through and beyond their parent’s cancer for the last 3 year and looks forward to making the magic happen every year going forward,” the USC Camp Kesem team said in a statement.
The week involves typical camp activities such as nature hikes, canoeing in the lake and talent shows, but it is also designed to address the needs and struggles the campers are facing, according to the organization’s website
“Just for how mature [the children] have to be, it’s really unfair how quickly they have to grow up but that’s what’s amazing about Camp Kesem,” said Ryan Ballard, a sophomore majoring in human biology and a Camp Kesem counselor. “We give them a chance to not have to grow up so quickly.”
For Ballard, the Cabin Chats, when the children talked about and reflected on what they are going through in a group setting, allowed him to really hear about what the campers were facing at home.
35 student volunteers work together to make this experience possible for campers. The program is not just for the children — the student volunteers said that it impacts them as well.
Nana Sarkodee-Adoo, a senior majoring in policy, planning and development, started out as a counselor before becoming a volunteer coordinator.
“What’s so cool is [to see] a 16 year old who is having such a difficult time at home but will still make time out of their day to check on all the people around them, check on all the counselors who should be checking on them,” Sarkodee-Adoo said. “That just inspires me to [make] sure the people around me are having a good day and finding little ways to spread magic in their lives. There is nothing that I have done at USC that has changed my life more.”

Undergraduate Student Government hosted its first-ever Welcome Back Festival in McCarthy Quad on Saturday. Approximately 100 students attended the event, which explored the theme of “Uniting the Trojan Family.”
Thirteen organizations participated, including the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, Asian Greek Council, Black Student Assembly, Environment Student Assembly, Habesha Student Association, International Student Association, Interfraternity Council, Latina/o Student Assembly, Multicultural Greek Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, Queer and Ally Student Assembly and Women’s Student Assembly.
“There are so many unique groups of students at USC, which are represented by these student organizations,” USG Senator Daniel Million, who helped organize the event, said in a statement emailed to the Daily Trojan. “Each and every organization that will be present at this event has carried out amazing and impactful events that they do throughout the year. This festival will give them all another opportunity to work together on one collective event that will show new and returning USC students that USC is moving towards a more united Trojan family.”
According to Million, USG held the event to bring diverse groups of USC students together at the start of the year.
“Many students on campus feel as though they are not connected with different groups on campus,” Million said. “The focus of this event is to improve the inclusivity of the USC community.”
USC Assistant Vice Provost for Student Support & Advocacy Lynette Merriman explained that all of the performers were USC undergraduates who had a chance to display their talents to the public during this festival.
Million said that he first conceived the idea when running for the Senate.
“I reached out to the assemblies, and together, we came to put on the event,” Million said. “When I first ran [for Senate] as a student on campus, I felt a little underwhelmed about the lack of representation on campus, regardless of race or class. [The festival] was a good opportunity to connect to everyone on campus and share different ideas and cultures.”
Million said that he plans for the event to be a staple within the USC community for many years to come. He also noted the help that the different cultural assemblies on campus provided when planning the festival.
“I felt it was impossible to have this happen without them,” Million said. “The sponsoring was vital, and I was happy to gain that for years to come.”

Kenneth Hall, a USC School of Cinematic Arts professor and the Ken Wannberg Endowed Chair in Music Editing, passed away on the night of Aug. 25.
Hall joined the faculty in 2005. He taught and oversaw many classes on sound, including CTPR 473, “Directing the Composer.” Students, most of whom have no musical background, learned the fundamentals of film music in the popular class.
According to a recent press release from the School of Cinematic Arts, his class had such a close-knit community that alumni of the class would come back every year for a reunion.
Hall edited over 950 TV productions and films during his career, including E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial and Mulan. He received two Gold Records for his work on these two films.
In addition, he was nominated for the Motion Picture Sound Editors Golden Reel Award for seven films: First Knight, L.A. Confidential, Executive Decision, Mr. Baseball, The Ghost & the Darkness, Star Trek: First Contact and Mulan. Many of the films went on to be nominated for and win Oscars.
Hall worked with distinguished film composers, including John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, Alex North, Henry Mancini, John Barry, Bill Conti, Maurice Jarre, Lalo Schifrin, Marvin Hamlisch, Lionel Newman and Miklos Rozsa.
He brought his passion to the classroom and was loved by all who worked with him each day.
“Ken was beloved by all of us — students, faculty and staff. He will be deeply missed as an artist, a teacher and a friend,” SCA Dean Elizabeth M. Daley said in the press release. “Ken brought an incredible passion and sense of fun to the classroom and his love of teaching touched the lives of countless graduates. Our thoughts are with his family.”

This upcoming Saturday the Trojan football team will face its most significant litmus test in years in Arlington, Texas. Opening up against the Alabama Crimson Tide, USC has a chance to see how they measure up with the best of the best.
Tal Volk | Daily TrojanTides of change · A football game between USC and Alabama in 1970 was pivotal in the desegregation of the Alabama football team. Now, one of the biggest controversies facing college football players is compensation.
Twelve years ago, USC was in Alabama’s position. Coming off of a national title, they started the season against Virginia Tech at another NFL stadium. USC beat Virginia Tech in a closely fought battle. Though the Hokies lost, their valiant effort set the stage for a successful 10-win season and a Sugar Bowl appearance.
While no Trojan fan is looking for moral victories against Alabama, the game offers a template for success, win or lose. With that being said, USC is certainly more talented than that Virginia Tech team and has the ability to beat Alabama. With strong line play on both sides of the ball, USC can win on Saturday.
It seems the best way to beat the Crimson Tide is to turn the game into a shootout with exceptional performances from a quarterback or tailback. Ole Miss, Oklahoma and Ohio State have all demonstrated the controlled and measured game plan it takes to outscore the imposing Tide.
It will be a tall task for redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne in his debut as a starter, just as facing off against Auburn was for former Heisman trophy winner Matt Leinart. With a stellar offensive line and a stable of great running backs and receivers, it’s possible that Browne can recreate history 12 years later and beat another excellent SEC foe.
While this game is a national headline of two storied programs facing off in the newly minted cathedral of football, its implications will probably be limited to the college football landscape. This was not the case 46 years ago, when USC faced off against the Tide in Alabama in 1970. That game reverberated well beyond the confines of the gridiron, catalyzing a monumental shift in race relations for the Alabama football team.
In that game, USC brought an all-black starting backfield into Alabama and pummeled the all-white Tide team, winning 42-21. Led by fullback Sam “Bam” Cunningham, the Trojans were too big and too fast for the Crimson Tide. Many attribute that game as the seminal moment and tipping point for coach Paul “Bear” Bryant of Alabama integrating his football team.
In Alabama, this was a monumental step for race relations. In a place where football is a religion to many, such a significant shift transcended the sport and echoed across the social stratosphere.
Last semester, I had the pleasure of watching the documentary that chronicles this event in Professor Jeff Fellenzer’s Sports, Business and Media course. In addition, we also heard from some of the key figures in that game: Cunningham, as well as former linebacker John Papadakis. I was stunned and amazed by the sheer magnitude of impact that one game had on an entire culture.
Sitting in that class, I also thought about how this year’s game could have been a platform for players to initiate progress in a different realm. While not nearly as pernicious or widespread as segregation, the exploitation of college football players is a serious issue.
Last year, sports agent and lawyer Donald Yee, wrote an op-ed before the college football championship. He suggested that if players were to boycott the game, they could instigate cascading effects of social and economic change. He even referenced the 1970 game between USC and Alabama as evidence of the power sports have to accelerate progress in society.
Obviously, his advice was not implemented before that game, nor will a boycott probably take place on Saturday. The incentives are not just there for the majority of players who are fringe NFL prospects at best. There are too many tangible immediate reasons not to boycott, with potential remote benefits too far in the future for players to justify such a move.
While a game like Saturday’s, and many in the upcoming future, provides the perfect platform for such a courageous act, boycotting would deprive many players of an opportunity for national exposure.
I’m uncertain about a definitive solution to fix this exploitation of college football players. I’m not solely talking about college sports as a whole, or even including basketball. Football alone generates millions of dollars for cable networks, conferences, schools and, of course, the NCAA. Players put their bodies and futures on the line for entertainment and don’t even receive a fraction of the proceeds. I don’t have the solution, but if you get enough of the brightest minds in the sport together, I’m sure something can be worked out.
I understand the need for amateurism in some sports, but NCAA football is not an amateur sport. If I was a star player at USC and generating millions of dollars for the school, I would be irate that I didn’t receive monetary compensation. A scholarship and stipend is great, but there needs to be more.
It probably won’t be Saturday, but sometime soon, a player or players will take the brave stand to sacrifice for the future of their sport. I don’t think I could do it if I was a player, but there are those out there with the conviction and fortitude to bring awareness and scrutiny toward this issue. Much like how the Missouri football team last year served as the tipping point for change, so too can a team ruin a national broadcast and hit the bottom line of the networks and the conferences.
This college football season, I hope for two things: For USC to beat Alabama and start a run toward the playoff and for someone or some team to catalyze a new progressive era. It may not change social institutions like the USC-Alabama game did 46 years ago, but such an action would have a profound impact and ripple across the college football landscape for years to come.

Tal Volk | Daily TrojanNot quite set · Former setter Baylee Johnson’s absence has left four players competing for the starting setter position as the season begins.
The women’s volleyball team hosted the Baden Tournament at the Galen Center for their first games of the season this weekend. At the tournament, the Trojans faced Marquette on Friday and Santa Clara and UC Irvine on Saturday. The Women of Troy lost all three matches.
The Trojans came out strong in their first set against Marquette, even without their key starters from last year. Despite a strong start; the team would go on to lose to both Marquette University and Santa Clara in four sets and then to UCI in three sets.
“We felt that with these matches, we lost them,” head coach Mick Haley said. “The other teams didn’t beat us.”
The Trojans had more than 20 attacking errors and more than 10 service errors in two out of their three matches. With that, they were handing out points without making the opposing team earn them.
Without former setter Baylee Johnson, who is academically ineligible, to control the speed of the team’s attacks and flow of their offense, USC’s need for a consistent setter has become evident. Along with returning senior setter Alice Pizzasegola, junior transfer Nikki Leonard and junior Reni Meyer-Whalley, Haley has also brought in senior Alexa Strange, who is most known for her skill on the sand for the beach volleyball team, all to compete for the starting setter position. Haley was constantly rotating all of his setters in the three games, looking for one that can do the job.
“We have four people vying for position, and nobody’s winning,” Haley said. “It’s hard to play during the season and have a competition, but now we are in it, and we have to deal with it.”
The uncertainty at setter has only been one of the problems Haley was forced to deal with during this tournament. The team’s passing was not as strong as it was last season throughout the games, causing the setter’s timing to suffer and ultimately leaving the hitters to settle for roll shots in order to salvage plays.
“The setting and the passing are critical,” Haley said. “We have a bunch of players that we need to decide who is going to play what position and score.”
While USC’s struggles were too much to overcome in this tournament, they had key moments that showed the great potential they have. One of the brightest stars of the tournament was freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier. In the second and third match, Lanier had a total of 30 kills and 15 digs.
“I thought Lanier finally got over her stage fright that got her [against Marquette],” Haley said. “She took a pretty good load on [against Santa Clara], which was good to see. She is going to be a workhorse for us. We just need to rally around her play.”
During the game against Santa Clara, Lanier led USC’s attempt at a comeback in the fourth set as she scored three points in a row off a kill, a block and another kill. Lanier’s play has been reminiscent of former standout Samantha Bricio’s incredible performance last season.
At one point during the Santa Clara game, Haley had to hold Lanier back from diving into the stands on a play for the second time in the match. Her passion and drive proved that she came to USC to play and give every match 100 percent of her effort.
Even with Lanier’s positive influence, the team suffered a set loss by a margin of 14 points, the worst loss for the team in years.
“We are at USC, and we aren’t prone to be underdogs,” Haley said. “We are prone to expect to win, and this is very disappointing right now.”
More than anything, Haley wants the team’s starting setter to be decided and for the team to move on from this tournament and progress into the team he knows they can become.
The Trojans will host the Radisson Classic next weekend. They will play Kentucky on Friday at 8 p.m. On Saturday,they will play the University of Northern Iowa at 10 a.m. and Creighton at 8 p.m., respectively.
Time for Coach Haley to retire along with two useless assistant coaches. A disappointing, pathetic performance against lower echelon teams. A disgrace to the program losing on your home court in that manner . Showing no spirit getting swept twice after winning the first set, then completely swept in the third match. This from an obvious over ranked squad by the experts. Looking to emulate the Men Volleyball of last season who won seven matches total.

The women’s soccer team broke into the win column for the first time this season after a 3-0 victory against the Pepperdine Waves on Sunday. The team rebounded after a stunning loss to unranked Long Beach State on Friday night.
Work for the W · Senior midfielder and defender Savannah Levin and the No. 11 Women of Troy (1-2) earned their first win of the season on Sunday in a 3-0 shutout of No. 20 Pepperdine after a Friday night loss to LBSU.
The No. 11 Women of Troy (1-2) took a 3-goal lead in the first half and did not give it up, shutting out the No. 20 Waves. Senior midfielder Morgan Andrews scored her first goal of the season, and the first goal of the game, in the tenth minute.
Andrews was followed by junior midfielder Sydney Sladek and freshman forward Taylor McMorrow who each scored their respective first goals of the year.
The Women of Troy rebounded after they fell to the 49ers despite outshooting them 13-5 and holding possession for a majority of the game on Friday night. Andrews led the Trojans with five shots, and redshirt junior forward Alex Anthony had three shots. A total of seven different players had at least one shot.
The 49ers scored the go-ahead goal in the 66th minute on a counter attack that led to a corner kick. After the goal, USC generated six more unsuccessful shots.
Head coach Keidane McAlpine called the loss a heartbreaker after the game but credited Long Beach State for their preparation and coaching.
“We had one moment where we lost concentration, but I give a lot of credit to Long Beach State and their coaching staff on tactically doing some great things tonight,” McAlpine said. “At the end of the day, it comes down to executing and finding ways to win games, and we didn’t do that.”
Redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme had three saves in the loss.
The team next heads to the South where they will face Georgia (in Auburn, Ala.) at 2:30 p.m. on Friday and Auburn at 4 p.m. on Sunday.

On Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Council passed a vote to insist that Gov. Jerry Brown declare homelessness a state emergency. The Council’s vote affirms a bill demanding an emergency declaration, which the California Assembly passed last June and the state Senate will evaluate in a pending vote. Concerned officials cite California’s 116,000 homeless residents — the most of any state — as evidence of needed reform. Many are young college students, struggling to mitigate the effects of displacement, while balancing the demands of higher education. In contemporary culture where college is treated as a necessity yet priced as a luxury, homeless students comprise a particularly burdened group to which universities, including USC, owe greater responsibility.
According to a study, about one in 10 of California State University’s 460,000 students are homeless, and about one in five does not have regular access to food. The rising cost of college tuition throughout both the state and the nation has exacerbated this growing trend. Since the 1980s, the price of higher education has increased at a rate twice that of medical care, and three times that of food or shelter. The exorbitant cost of higher education, compounded by staggering rental rates, have left these students without appropriate, permanent housing.
In the absence of a comprehensive response from state legislators, some public universities in California have taken initiatives to address this crisis. Eleven of the CSU campuses now offer some form of assistance to displaced students, be it a support center or a pantry containing food and other necessities.
In 2007, Congress broadened the definition of “independent student” on the FAFSA to include homeless youth, thus allowing homeless high school students applying to colleges to acquire grants and loans without financial documentation from their parents. However, Congress failed to address other outstanding issues, such as year-round housing. When school breaks for summer or the holidays, homeless students living in college housing then have nowhere to sleep. Although international students and athletes are typically offered the opportunity to stay on campus during these times, few universities extend this offer to homeless students.
The Department of Education decided this summer to ease FAFSA restrictions yet abstained from mandating that schools provide homeless students with any kind of housing. If the Higher Education Act is reauthorized this year, lawmakers could approve legislation mandating housing for homeless students receiving federal financial aid.
If such a scenario occurs, the federal government would force both public and private universities to provide homeless students with housing. Further, this possibility means that the federal government would require USC, a private university, which does not have year-round housing for homeless students, to comply.
As partisan politics delay reform, USC must take this initiative into its own hands. The right to housing is not only a fundamental human right but also an absolute necessity for students expected to perform at the highest level in their courses. As a university that values social justice and human rights, USC, regardless of federal mandate, must act.

The National Labor Relations Board issued a decision last week granting graduate students in private universities the right to unionize. The case originated at Columbia University, where a group of students filed a petition to join the United Auto Workers, an action vehemently opposed by Columbia and several other universities in a joint brief to the NLRB. The ruling overturns a 2004 precedent that graduate students were not considered employees, a reversal with far-reaching implications for student-athletes and undergraduates on work-study.
In response, Columbia officials sounded the alarm over the academic repercussions of the ruling, citing concerns that union negotiations would intrude upon academic issues such as class size and degree requirements. They argue that the ruling degrades the student-faculty relationship by equating it to an employee-employer relationship. Despite these lofty ideals, however, it is an insult to academic freedom to scapegoat it in favor of perpetuating a system of modern indentured servitude.
Private universities’ hand-wringing over unionization is surprising, given that graduate students have been allowed to unionize at public universities in many states for decades — and the sky still hasn’t fallen. In a 2013 Cornell University study, researchers analyzed the effects of graduate student unions on public universities, and found that unionization often improved student-faculty relationships both personally and professionally and had no effect on academic freedom. Giving students a voice in their working conditions only enhances job satisfaction and motivation.
The shadowy arrangement between graduate students and universities has long served as justification for universities to deny graduate students the rights afforded to employees. Generally, graduate students are given free tuition and a stipend in exchange for work in the classroom and in the lab. However, Ph.D. students typically only take classes for the first couple of years, rendering free tuition hollow, and their stipends are inadequate for the essential, highly skilled work they provide. Graduate students are tasked with much of the work that allows universities to function, including grading, teaching and supporting faculty research. In fact, graduate students do much of the same work as university faculty, albeit at a lower level.
The work that graduate students are expected to perform also runs counter to the central purpose of their academic program — to conduct their own dissertation research. Heavy teaching and research assistant workloads distract from the process of earning their own degree. Few people would argue that teaching experience is necessary for a doctorate, and doing menial tasks for a professor’s own research is no substitute for learning to become an independent researcher. The work that graduate students do is entirely separate from their academic training. The reason that graduate students serve as research or teaching assistants is not to “gain knowledge and expertise,” as a Columbia spokesperson claimed, but to earn money. In other words, graduate students are employees.
Collective bargaining makes it possible for graduate students to be adequately compensated for the hard work and long hours they put in. New York University, the only private university to voluntarily recognize graduate student unions, saw a dramatic improvement in the status of graduate students after unionization. At NYU, where graduate students were previously expected to live on just $12,500 a year — in New York, no less — collective bargaining led to the university eliminating health care premiums and doubling graduate student stipends.
It is disgraceful to see so many prestigious universities — not only Columbia and Stanford, but the entire Ivy League — oppose unionization solely to avoid fairly compensating graduate students. Universities have long exploited the gray area between academia and business for their own gain. When USC raises tuition far beyond what families can afford and pays its administrators like CEOs, it’s because college is a business and students can’t expect colleges not to maximize profit. But take that principle further and suggest that graduate students or college athletes should be able to unionize, and immediately universities turn defensive and claim finances are corrupting academia.
Allowing graduate students to unionize is an important step, but progress shouldn’t end here. If universities are willing to profit off student labor, then there must be some mechanism to correct the power imbalance and protect students. The services that students provide are too lucrative for universities to be expected to protect their students’ worker rights without leverage. Like it or not, college is a business — it’s time we treated it like one.

Photo courtesy of The Broad MuseumAll of the lights · Yayoi Kasuma’s Infinity Mirrored Room is a mirror-lined chamber housing a dazzling and seemingly endless LED light display.
The Infinity Mirrored Room – The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away has been a popular social media attraction for visitors at the Broad Museum. Yayoi Kasuma, the Japanese artist behind the exhibit, will present his new installation, Yayoi Kasuma: Infinity Mirrors, at the museum in Fall 2017. This will be The Broad’s first visiting special exhibition and will feature six infinity rooms. All rooms will showcase Kasuma’s signature psychedelic kaleidoscope alliance of color and light in an immersive environment.
Yayoi Kasuma is an artist who has explored a variety of mediums such as sculpture, painting and environmental art. She has been acclaimed for her special ability to portray abstract landscapes and concepts using her avant-garde style. Her artwork has been widely exhibited in Europe and America during the late 20th century. Kasuma’s fame in the ’60s ballooned through her antiwar activism and her active feminist stance.
Yayoi Kasuma: Infinity Mirrors will expand on the thematic environmental art of transformative light and polka dots. The exhibition will begin with Infinity Mirror Room — Phali’s Field. First unveiled in 1965, the exhibit is a  room that features a dizzying sea of white and red polka-dotted tubers. The polka dots continue in Dots Obsession — Love Transformed into Dots, in which larger-than-life pink and black sculptures encroach the room. Other exhibitions such as Aftermath of Obliteration of Eternity, spotlight LED environments such as her current exhibit at the museum.
The new Broad exhibition in Fall 2017, running until 2018, will be an opportunity to explore Yayoi Kasuma’s work that garnered her fame in the 1950s to the present.
“Our Infinity Mirrored Room has become a cultural phenomenon and many of our visitors are extremely passionate about Kusama’s work,” said Joanne Heyler, founding director of The Broad. “The timing is right for an exhibition that contextualizes the infinity rooms and brings Kusama’s contributions to 20th- and 21st-century art into deeper focus. We are thrilled to present this unprecedented special exhibition at The Broad next year that engages seven decades of work by a phenomenal artist.”
The hashtag,   #InfiniteKasuma, marks Kasuma’s most significant tour on the West Coast. Only five museums will showcase the #InfiniteKasuma tour — Smithsonian’s Hirshhorn Museum, Seattle Art Museum, The Broad, Art Gallery of Ontario and Cleveland Museum of Art.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the exhibition will include paintings, works on paper and sculptures from the early ’50s to the present. The exhibit will not be free.
The upcoming exhibition will open in Fall 2017, and it marks a special opportunity to expand Angelenos’ obsession with the Infinity Mirrored Room.

For most of my adolescence, I believed the lie that a lighter skin complexion was more worthy and signified greater beauty. As someone who grew up as a dark-skinned Asian, I knew I did not fall into that category.
It was the first thing that anybody would ever point out whenever they saw me. I remember very clearly, on a family vacation to Hong Kong, a stranger saw my mom and me and stopped us.
“Hi little girl, are you Native American?” he asked me, smiling. His voice was condescending and high-pitched. “Why is your mom so pale and why are you so dark?”
He asked my mom in Cantonese, unaware that I speak fluent Cantonese, if I was adopted.
I remember running to the bathroom and sobbing in a stall because I did not want anybody to know and also because I couldn’t hold the tears in.
I was only 7 years old, but at that moment, I knew that there was more than one way to look “Asian.”
The homogeneity of East Asian beauty is startling and in a way, unsettling. If you look in any Korean, Japanese, Chinese or Taiwanese magazine, every girl has the same porcelain skin, small pink lips, straight eyebrows, dyed straight hair, and big eyes with double eyelids. Their bodies are petite and have super slim figures.
However, if you asked any millennial what the American beauty standard would be, chances are it would be along the lines of tan skin, full or thick lips, a curvy physique but with a nice flat stomach and arched and well done eyebrows. White people actually pay to get darker and make trips to the beach just to tan and pale means that you didn’t go out much.
Whenever some of my friends suggest to go to the beach to go tanning, I think about if I ever went back to Taiwan, my grandparents would be encouraging me to stay in the shade so I don’t get too “dark.” Whenever some of my friends talk about wanting a bigger booty, I think about how that would have been viewed negatively in Asian media. I have realized that, as an Asian American, I will never be completely homogenous to the beauty standards of both of the worlds that I am from.
Over the years, my skin has lightened naturally, possibly due to the fact that I hate playing sports and prefer indoor activities. However, there are still parts of my body that are darker than others, and I still tan extremely easily, especially in the summer.
But guess what? I take it with a grain of salt. How can I hate myself, when God has made me the way that I am with my best intentions in mind? It’s great that it doesn’t matter to me anymore. But I can’t help but wonder — if it has taken me so many years of self-loathing and self-doubt to come to this conclusion, how many other girls in the world currently hate themselves because they don’t meet a certain physical and cultural beauty ideal?
I think of my younger self, the one who thought that drinking milk or bathing in lemons would make herself feel less worthless and more beautiful, who cried in the bathroom, and I would never want any other young teen girl to hate herself because she is bombarded with these standards of beauty that she can’t live up to.
It’s too late to go back and change where it began, but it’s not too late to change the way it will end. What’s the solution besides the advice that everyone gives, like “love the skin you’re in and love who you are?” The solution is not only limited to practicing self love, but also with diversity in media and acceptance within our own community. There are almost no celebrities in Asian films and television who are darker skinned unless cast as the villain or a derogatory role. Being beautiful and being light are not mutually exclusive, and we can all work toward shattering this belief by viewing and treating every person of every hue equally and calling out other people who promote colorism. Nobody deserves to feel like a foreigner in their own culture.

Photo courtesy of RCA RecordsOops, she did it again · America’s favorite pop princess is back and better than ever with her ninth studio album, Glory. Glory is her ninth studio album. Her hit single off the album, “Make Me,” features G-Eazy.
Against all odds, Britney Spears is back and better than ever. After her uninspired and generic last album Britney Jean scraped in career-low sales, critics predicted the beginning of the end for the pop princess, whose flat offering signaled a dangerous decline into irrelevance, desperation and even a loss of passion for her craft. However, three years later Britney has once again proved her staying power with Glory, a fresh, well-produced, even at times beautiful, monster-sized album of 17 tracks. Albeit stubbornly impersonal and flawed, Glory embraces current musical trends of EDM while also maintaining Spears’ distinct sound.
Glory’s tracks mostly fall into two categories: downtempo EDM and radio-friendly dance-pop. The album enjoys a polished ambiance thanks to its many talented producers who have worked with industry giants such as Kanye West and Justin Bieber. Dreamy songs like “If I’m Dancing” and the minimalistic “Just Luv Me” ride today’s club music wave and thrum with echoes and whispers. Listeners looking for more energized material will enjoy dance-pop offerings such as “Better.” Bangers like “Liar” and “What You Need,” also effectively make use of traditional instrumentals like strings, brass and harmonica.
Many of Glory’s tracks also display a willingness to experiment; “Man on the Moon” uses a marimba sound to great effect, “Just Like Me” contains acoustic guitar and “Change Your Mind (No Seas Cortes)” and “Coupure Électrique” dabble in foreign languages. These offerings mostly work thanks to Glory’s producers, who ensure that the album’s more unusual choices are inspired and well-integrated. Overall, Glory runs the gambit from mesmerizing jams to radio-friendly bangers and succeeds with a dash of experimentalism, successfully embodying the album’s goal to be acutely aware of trends while not being confined by them.
This does not mean, however, that Glory does not suffer from some of the same problems that plagued Britney Jean. At times, the album embodies the generic sound that reeks of a single-minded desire for radio play, particularly on the uninspired “Love Me Down.” For all of Glory’s mostly stellar production, there are also several missteps in songs like “Clumsy,” “Do You Wanna Come Over?” and “Hard to Forget Ya,” which overwhelm the listener with a cacophony of sound and layer so many effects on Britney’s voice that it is unrecognizable.
In terms of vocals, Glory is also mixed. Britney has never exactly been a vocal powerhouse. Her trademark crooning warble is immediately recognizable but has a rather limited range. Her vocal shortcomings are painfully apparent when she tackles EDM, a genre which often requires stronger singers are overwhelmed by powerful, soaring instrumentals — just look at Sia’s vocals on “Titanium.” Britney’s limited range is especially conspicuous on the track “Invitation,” in which the producers attempt to make up for her limited range but instead render her voice unrecognizable. However, on a brighter note, the singer’s delivery throughout Glory sounds more invested than it has in years, which partially makes up for her vocal shortcomings.
The most disappointing deficiency of Glory, however, is its stubborn insistence on being impersonal. For all of Britney Jean’s flaws, it was also a promising attempt at making Britney’s songs more intimate — she gave the listener a window into her struggles and had a hand in writing every song. In Glory, Britney is credited as a writer in less than half of the tracks, and it clearly shows. Nearly all of the songs portray her as a one-dimensional sexpot with three modes: pursuing sex, discussing sex or actively having sex. In “Make Me…” the chorus consists almost entirely of sex moans. Glory may represent a promising new musical direction for Britney’s career, but her persona is disappointingly stagnant. Songs like “Slumber Party” and “Private Show” simply present her as a sexually aggressive caricature. Glory fails to match its uniqueness of sound with a corresponding effort placed into its lyrics, and it is a real missed opportunity.
Overall, Glory is a fresh, fun and well-produced album that reflects a return to form for Britney. She has a great team behind her, a knack for being both trendy and experimental and a mature new sound. In terms of musical style, Glory promises to make Britney relevant again and put her career back in gear. Her album let listeners learn more about the person behind all of the hits and comebacks, a good reason why this icon who keeps dusting herself off and getting back in the business. Welcome back, Britney — Let the princess reclaim her throne.

Hey, Daily Trojan readers!
My name is Allegra, and I host Radio Gumball on KXSC, a weekly show devoted to new and local music. I also book concerts at USC and around LA, and am in an indie rock band that plays shows and releases music. 
Basically, I live and breathe music, and at a certain point it gets to be too much inside my head and I have to let it all out and tell other people about all the awesome stuff going on in LA and around the world.
So this column, Tune View, will be a biweekly roundup of everything new and cool in music— that is, my specific favorite areas of music, because I don’t claim to be musically omniscient.
I’ll try to keep a focus on USC events and musicians as well, as there are so many talented students and alumni as well as amazing events featuring them on- and off-campus.
Carly Rae Jepsen – Emotion Side B
Carly Rae, queen of pop, has delivered unto us a magnificent companion to last year’s divine Emotion. Emotion Side B, contains 8 tracks’ worth of candyfloss bops that, even as B-sides, are better than 90% of the actual pop album material being released.
LIYL (Listen If You Like): Ellie Goulding, J-Pop, living your best life
Glass Animals – How To Be a Human Being
You probably heard “Gooey” from Glass Animals’ last album when it was all over alt radio a couple years ago, and you’ve probably been hearing “Life Itself” (their new album’s title track) all over alt radio all summer. Their full sophomore album is out now, and it’s worth a full listen— a blurry and blissed-out maze of ropy synths and reverberating vocals, creating surreal scenes with ease and agility.
LIYL: The Avalanches, Alt-J, taking LSD in a jungle while eating Cheetos
Young Thug – No, My Name is JEFFERY
The 21st century’s resident court rap-jester has released his new mixtape, whose title is a reference to his birth name (Jeffery Lamar Williams) and whose striking cover features the artist stunting in Italian unisex couture. Young Thug’s infectious delivery and melodic production makes for the perfect late-summer soundtrack.
LIYL: Future, Travi$ Scott, going tf off
KAYE – Honey EP
Though she’s recently found sucess as the lead singer of San Fermin, Charlene Kaye has always had a knack for empowering, catchy solo material that hits the sweet spot between grunge and pop. Her new EP under the moniker KAYE, Honey, is 17 straight minutes of feminist fire. 
LIYL: Ingrid Michaelson, Shura, singing into a hairbrush in front of a mirror
Miya Folick – Pet Body
If you’ve never heard of Miya Folick, now’s the time to get acquainted. Judging by the fevered reaction to each song she releases and the growing crowds at her tiny shows, she’s going to be the next big thing in alternative music. Her new single “Pet Body” is a rollicking, raucus 60s-style punk jam featuring some truly indelible imagery.
LIYL: Mitski, Torres, getting sweet revenge on everyone who’s ever hurt you
Zipper Club w/ Nova Darlings @ The Satellite Mon, 8/29
Zipper Club’s debut single “Going The Distance” was produced by The Smashing Pumpkins’ James Iha, and it is very good. They rock the last night of their Satellite residency with USC pop band the Nova Darlings. Free show!
vōx @ Skybar Mondrian Tues, 8/30
LA resident Sarah Winters’ musical project vōx (pronounced “wokes”) is making some serious vibey waves. She just played the Play Like A Girl showcase at the Echo, and now she’s playing the hoity-toity Mondrian’s Tunesday series. Free with RSVP!
KNOWER, Thumpasaurus, Max Ox @ YONI Fri, 9/2
It’s all going down at YONI. KNOWER is the most searing band to ever emerge from USC’s jazz program, and Max Ox is a VERY close second. And Thumpasaurus will follow closely behind once they graduate. $5 at the door.
Rough And Rushed Fest Sat, 9/3
It’s a festival on a rooftop, what more could you ask for? Some really great bands are gonna tear it up— most notably Kid Cadaver, Ramonda Hammer, and Tennis System. $15 in advance, $20 at doors.
Beating Lights Presents: Kaleidoscope Sunday Sun, 9/4

Bird & Thorn, Night Talks, Bird Concerns, Tone in Georgia @ The Hi Hat Weds 9/7
The Hi Hat never fails when it comes to weeknight local indie rock gigs. Two of my all-time favorite LA bands, Night Talks and Tone in Georgia, share the stage with two avian-named groups (one of whom, Bird & Thorn, is celebrating their album release). 18+, $5. 
Deep Sea Diver, Gothic Tropic @ The Bootleg Sun 9/11
Deep Sea Diver’s electrifying and intense Secrets was one of the best indie rock releases this year. They play the cozy Bootleg Theatre, with the fantastic Gothic Tropic opening up the show. 21+, $10.
