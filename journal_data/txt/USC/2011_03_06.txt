After a week of competition, the USC men’s swim team took home third place at the Pac-10 men’s swimming championships in Long Beach, Calif.
The No. 7 Trojans finished behind No. 1 California and Pac-10 champion No. 2 Stanford.

After the first day of competition on Wednesday, the Trojans were in third place behind the two Northern California teams.
As the meet progressed through to Saturday, USC kept that  spot while Stanford remained in control of first place. With its win at Pac-10s, the Cardinal won its 30th consecutive Pac-10 title.
“We did not really match up with those two teams [Cal and Stanford] because they have so many more people, so many more seniors,” said freshman Vlad Morozov. “By next year we will match up with them better than this year.”
Several young USC swimmers displayed strong performances that helped bump USC past Arizona for the third place spot. Sophomore Clement Lefert was awarded medals in three events, taking first place in the 500-yard free and third in both the 200-yard free and 200-yard fly.
Sophomore Charlie Charlesworth took second in the 1650-yard free, while freshman Dimitri Colupaev won his first Pac-10 title when he took first the 200-yard free. Morozov finished second in the 50-yard and 100-yard free, barely being beaten by Cal’s senior Nathan Adrian in both.
“I got second in the 50-and-100 free, but I didn’t think I would be that close to Cal’s Nathan Adrian, a 2008 Olympian,” Morozov said. “I don’t think anyone thought I’d be that close, so at NCAAs I’ll keep my head up and see if I can beat him.”
Despite not taking home first place at the Pac-10 championships, the Trojans did well based on the goals they had set for themselves before the meet.
“We knew Cal and Stanford were out of our reach so our focus was on beating Arizona and taking home as many individual medals as we could,” Lefert said. “We haven’t finished third in Pac-10s since 2005 so it was a good job. We have a young team — a lot of freshman and sophomores — and they stepped up.”
Looking toward the NCAA competition at the end of March, USC is focused on its next goal: placing in the top five.
“Our relays are going to be a major factor in reaching that goal,” Morozov said. “At NCAAs we are going to break some records.”

Down three points with 15 seconds left in the game, junior guard Jacki Gemelos made the kind of decision that keeps coaches up at night.
Rather than work the ball around for an easier shot, she launched — and drained — a contested 28-foot three-pointer. After a tense final seconds that saw the teams combine for three turnovers, the game went into overtime deadlocked at 53.
“We have a lot of confidence in Jacki’s ability to score,” said USC coach Michael Cooper. “She is one of her best shooters from that type of range.  It was a great shot.”
In the extra period, the teams matched each other basket for basket until Gemelos pulled up for another three, this one from much closer, to give the Women of Troy a 62-59 lead they would not relinquish.
“It’s a testament to this team that they were able to pull it together and get the win,” Cooper said.
Junior guard Briana Gilbreath blocked a layup attempt in the final minute to seal the 65-61 victory for USC on senior day.
“I wish it hadn’t been that close but it was a great win and a great game,” said senior center Kari LaPlante.  “Hopefully we can keep this momentum for [the Pac-10 tournament].”
Emotions ran high for the Women of Troy during a pregame tribute to its two graduating seniors,­­ LaPlante and forward Michelle Franco.
None of that emotion was present in the opening minutes for USC, however.  Seeming content to launch contested jumpers, the Women of Troy came out flat and found themselves in an early 7-2 hole.
But USC, led by LaPlante and Franco, clawed back into the game, passing up outside shots in favor of post opportunities. An offensive rebound turned into a three-point play for Franco, and LaPlante beat her defender off the dribble for a layup.
Gilbreath capped a frustrating first half by picking up a late technical foul. USC’s leading scorer missed all eight of her field goal attempts in the first half and finished the game with 12 points on just 3-for-17 from the field.
Gilbreath did collect 10 rebounds and six assists in the game.
Gemelos and freshman forward Cassie Harberts paced USC in the first half with eight and seven points, respectively. Gemelos’ layup just before the halftime buzzer gave the Women of Troy a 28-20 lead going into the break.
Up 37-22 early in the second half, USC was seemingly on its way to a comfortable victory before sloppy play and poor shooting allowed the Huskies to end regulation on a 31-16 run.
With younger, less inexperienced players inserted into the lineup, USC struggled.
“Call [the run] a coach’s decision,” Cooper said.  “We wanted to get some kids some playing time at home. The momentum was going our way. If I had to do it over again I’d probably do it a little bit at a time instead of all at once.”
Gemelos led the Women of Troy with 15 points,  including four three-pointers, and started at point guard in place of junior guard Ashley Corral, who was suspended two games for violating team rules.
In their final home games, LaPlante and Franco added eight and three points, respectively. As a team, the Women of Troy shot just 33 percent but made 17 of their 30 free throw attempts.
Down three with fifteen seconds left what easier shot would that be knowing you need a trey to tie. Gemelos had enough room from the defender to launch the shot. I was looking right at the play to see a clear opening, slightly long distance, there was really no choice. Are you serious with your last statement that the field goal % was only 1/3 while making 17 of 30 FTs was somehow good being 56+%.

The most intangible difference between two teams with similar talent this weekend was the Trojans’ ability to close out competitive games while maintaining their relaxed demeanor.
Strong play · Junior middle blocker Steven Shandrick finished with 15 kills and 13 blocks over the weekend, leading USC to two wins over BYU. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team left no questions unanswered this weekend as to which team sits atop the NCAA volleyball pyramid, eking out two five set victories over No. 2 BYU,  25-21, 17-25, 25-17, 21-25, 15-12 and 25-18, 23-25, 25-16, 22-25, 15-10.
“We showed a lot of heart these past two matches,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “These were big-time matches. Every time we punched them, they punched us back; we traded sets back and forth both nights.”
An unsung role player for most of the season, junior middle blocker Steven Shandrick managed to emerge as All-American senior opposite Murphy Troy’s primary sidekick Friday night, registering 10 kills at a blistering .667 clip with a healthy five blocks. For his part, Murphy Troy hit 22 kills at .526.
Saturday night, Shandrick was relatively quiet until the Trojans were down 5-2 in the fifth set. Then, Shandrick nearly single-handedly won three consecutive points, registering a “roof” block, kill and ace in succession. Once the set was tied, the Trojans never looked back.
“That was a great team, and it really speaks volumes about our ability to execute that we won two nights in a row,” Shandrick said. “They were a challenge to block. We’re very similar teams. We both like to run quick offenses. I want to go best-of-five.”
A wrinkle to the Cougars’ game plan on Saturday night was their implementation of a different setter, junior Joe Kauliakamoa, against whom the Trojans had no experience. Kauliakamoa exhibited a fair amount of guile throughout the match, not only amassing 45 assists, but also hitting four quick kills which caught the Trojan defense off-guard.
“We settled down and adjusted to [Kauliakamoa] in the third set,” Ferguson said. “He was a lot tougher to read, but our blockers finally focused a little bit better and were able to limit him more as the match went on.”
Although Ciarelli’s hitting this weekend was not up to his usual standards, Ferguson quickly singled out Ciarelli’s sure-handedness on defense as crucial to the Trojans’ success.
Ciarelli was pitted against BYU junior opposite Rob Stowell both nights and limited the prolific scorer to a combined 37 kills on 88 combined attempts. Stowell’s hitting percentage did not reach .300 on either night.
“[BYU is] is just a good team all around,” Ciarelli said. “They have two middles and two outsiders who can put the ball away. When they’re in system, they’re really tough to beat.”
The Trojans continue their homestand against UC San Diego on Friday at 7 p.m.
FIGHT ON!! Keep knocking them down Trojan Volleyball!

In an unsettling era — when arbitrary decisions are often rendered by college athletics’ governing body, unintended consequences tend to emerge.
In 2006, the NCAA implemented a new bylaw originally enacted to allow it to exercise greater control over college football recruiting.
Specifically, bylaw 13.1.8.9.4 prevents Football Bowl Subdivision coaches from attending any independent football camps or combines showcasing prospective student athletes at any location at any time.
Coaches may only be present at “scholastic” activities such as games and practices. Even then, they must be permitted by the respective high school athletic association.
In response to such restrictions, college football programs have resorted to soliciting the assistance of various scouting services such as XOS Digital, which in turn, can provide programs with film and analysis of various high school prospects.
Think a $99.95 annual subscription to Rivals.com on steroids.
With coaches grounded, an increased need for data and information about potential prospects has emerged.
USC uses multiple scouting services, as do the majority of major FBS programs. It seems customary these days.
But because the NCAA has forced schools to increase reliance on such independent scouting programs, there has simultaneously been an effort made by some schools’ to push the envelope in their payment of “scouts.”
Despite helping to foster this climate, the NCAA eventually will want to take action against these rogue scouts.
Based on recent events, it appears Oregon is going to allow the NCAA to clean up after it.
To clarify: Last week, multiple media outlets reported NCAA officials have begun investigating a $25,000 payment made by the university to Will Lyles of Complete Scouting Services in Houston, according to the State of Oregon expenditure records.
“This is no different than services purchased by a number of colleges and universities throughout the country,” read a statement issued by the school.
But then again, there are some differences. For starters, Lyles, a former athletic trainer, is alleged to have had a “mentoring relationship” with current Ducks freshman running back Lache Seastrunk, who coincidently was a highly-rated recruit coming out of Texas in 2010.
And the $25,000 price tag is also significantly higher than most scouts charge.
“For $25,000, it better provide a hell of a lot,” said Scouting Evaluation Association founder Dick Lascola in a story published on SI.com on Friday. “That’s an exorbitant amount of money to pay for something.”
In fact, the $25,000 package was not even made available on Lyles’ website until Friday, one day after allegations surfaced.
Previously, the site listed a “JUCO price list” for $3,000, a multi-state region package for $5,000, a “trifecta package” including any three states for $8,000 and a “national package” for $15,000.
That Lyles’ $25,000 package was unavailable insinuates the service was offered only to Oregon, raising questions as to the legitimacy of his scouting.
If, in fact, Lyles was used to recruit Seastrunk to Eugene, Ore., it would constitute an NCAA violation, since Lyles would be deemed a booster, as noted by Yahoo! Sports.
And considering Lyles’ payments came shortly after Seastrunk signed his national letter of intent in February 2010, such a scenario appears all the more likely.
But regardless of Oregon’s guilt, it’s going to get hammered, because the NCAA needs to make a statement regarding this issue.
It’s a problem the organization helped create, but, it’s going to send a message regardless.
In recent years, the NCAA’s decisions have been largely motivated by a desire to address certain issues it deems unsuitable for the sport.
When the topic of student athletes looking to profit off their own images (see: Reggie Bush, Terrelle Pryor), it took action. In essence, it made an example of USC, and, to a much lesser extent, Ohio State.
The same goes for the recent developments in Oregon. Despite helping to cultivate this culture, the NCAA is on the warpath and looking to punish Lyles and his top client.
At this point, Oregon’s relationship with Lyles is suspicious. On paper, they look guilty.
But until conclusive facts emerge, it’s still a relative unknown.
Regardless, an activist NCAA is looking to drop the hammer and address the issue of street agents in college sports. And when the NCAA wants to do something, whether right or wrong, it usually does it.
We’ve seen this movie before.

The USC baseball team is officially on the schneid.
Following  a 3-1 start to begin the year, USC has now dropped seven straight games, including all three games of its weekend series against No. 7 Cal State Fullerton.
Including Sunday’s showing against the Titans, five of the losses have come by three runs or less, and four have been by one run.
“I don’t think anyone who’s watching us play can say we aren’t competing,” said USC coach Frank Cruz.
Sunday’s  game was a pitchers’ duel with both starters lasting into the eigth. USC senior starter Logan Odom threw 104 pitches over seven and two-third innings, giving up two runs (one earned) on three hits, while walking just one and striking out three.
Odom was overshadowed by Titan starter Colin O’Connell, who threw eight shutout innings, allowing one unearned run on just three hits, all without walking a Trojan batter.
Both pitchers were so dominant the game finished in one hour and 52 minutes — USC’s first sub-two hour game since March 4, 2007.
“I felt good,” Odom said. “But it’s hard to feel good about a whole lot right now.”
Both teams went down in order in the first two innings until a two-out hit, a steal and an error led to the first run of the game and a 1-0 Titan lead.
Fullerton scored once more in the fourth with a leadoff triple and a sacrifice-fly, but that would be it for the scoring until the bottom of the eighth.
With two down, junior first baseman Matt Foat singled to center and advanced to third when the ball got by the center fielder. Junior left fielder Brandon Garcia followed up with an RBI-groundout to short, and the Trojans were on the board.
USC did threaten in the ninth, but at that point, it was too late.
Junior preseason All-American first baseman Ricky Oropesa was up with two down and speedy freshman pinch-runner Omar Cotto Lozada on first as the tying run, but the Fullerton closer got Oropesa swinging on a full count to end the game.
The first two games of the series were played on Friday and Saturday in Orange County, and the results there were no better for USC.
USC was down 2-1 in the fourth when its took its only lead of the series.
Oropesa doubled with one down and advanced to third on senior second baseman Joe De Pinto’s single. A passed ball allowed Oropesa to score and De Pinto to move up to second. A wild pitch moved De Pinto to third, and he gave the Trojans the lead on a Foat RBI grounder.
But Fullerton put up a four-spot for the second straight game. In the fifth, junior starting pitcher Austin Wood allowed a leadoff walk and then balked, advancing the runner to second. From there, it all fell apart. After a double and an error, Wood was lifted following four-plus innings and four runs (three earned).
Junior Ben Mount was brought in to minimize the damage, but it was not his day. He walked the first hitter, allowed a two-RBI single to the next and then allowed a run on a wild pitch before finally getting out of the inning with four on the board and the Trojans down 6-3.
The Trojans went down in order in three of their final five innings, only once managing to put a runner in scoring position. Fullerton scored once more in the eighth to make the final 7-3.
The opening game in Fullerton on Friday was even worse, as the Titans dominated in every way.
Preseason All-American pitcher Noe Ramirez threw eight innings of one-hit ball, walking two and striking out eight.  USC went down in order in six of its nine turns at bat, getting just four men on base the entire game.
“Friday we played really, really bad,” Cruz said. “That was our worst game of the season so far.”
The Titans jumped out in front early, plating four in the third against junior starter Andrew Triggs, all with two outs.
USC didn’t even get its first hit until the fifth, leading to its only run of the game.
But the Titans got the run right back in their half of the fifth, and put two more across in the sixth. Following USC’s second error of the game, Triggs was pulled after tossing five and one-third innings and seven runs, but only four earned.
Fullerton got three more in the eighth behind a pair of wild pitches and allowing the Trojans’ third error of the game to make the 10-1 final USC’s worst loss of the season.
“It’s tough right now,” De Pinto said. “But we gotta focus on ourselves and things will turn around.”
The Trojans finally face some unranked competition this week when they travel up the coast to Santa Barbara to take on the Gouchos at 3 p.m. Tuesday.
Hey Nick, how can a run score with two outs when the batter grounds out to shortstop to end the inning. Nobody
proof reads their work anymore or has someone else check it for them.

USC ended the regular season with a 62-60 win at Washington on Saturday, clinching the fourth seed in the Pac-10 tournament at Staples Center. USC won five of its last six games of the regular season.
Stepping up · Junior guard Jio Fontan poured in a game-high 20 points to lead USC to a win at Washington.  With the win, the Trojans clinched the No. 4 seed in the Pac-10 tournament and will face California on Thursday. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The Huskies (20-10, 11-7) lead the Pac-10 in scoring, averaging 84.9 points per game, but the Trojans (18-13, 10-8) controlled the tempo, holding Washington to 60 points, which was four points above its season low.
After falling behind early in their loss to Washington State on Thursday, the Trojans were determined to get off to a fast start Saturday. Junior guard Jio Fontan scored USC’s first five points as the Trojans started the game on a 7-2 run.
USC made its first six shots of the game, and led by as many as 15 points in the first half. At halftime, the Trojans led 36-26, and had outrebounded the Huskies 18-9.
Employing full-court pressure, Washington managed to battle back in the second half.
With only six Trojans playing more than eight minutes, USC appeared fatigued late in the game.
After making their first 12 free throws, the Trojans only made seven of their last 12.
The Trojans’ inability to make free throws late in the game allowed the Huskies to reduce USC’s lead.
Washington’s Scott Suggs scored with two seconds left in the game to cut USC’s advantage to two points, the smallest margin of the second half, but the Trojans were able to inbound the ball and hold on for the win.
Suggs had 14 points off the bench for the Huskies. Washington’s bench outscored USC’s reserves 18-6.
The Huskies’ leading scorer, guard Isaiah Thomas, had 16 points, but he missed eight of his 13 shot attempts.
Washington leads the Pac-10 with an average of 39.7 rebounds per game, but the Trojans managed to win the battle on the boards, 36-25.
Fontan had a game-high 20 points and four assists for the Trojans. Junior forward Nikola Vucevic added 19 points and 10 rebounds, his eighth-consecutive double-double. Senior forward Alex Stepheson also had a double-double, finishing with 11 points and 14 rebounds.
The Trojans have earned a first-round  bye in the Pac-10  tournament.
USC will play California at noon on Thursday in the men’s quarterfinals at Staples Center.

“Greeks Gone Green” and “Green is Sexy” are some of the slogans students will be seeing on merchandise sold around campus this week.
The Panhellenic Council has organized a “Greeks Gone Green” campaign, designed to make students more aware of sustainability at USC.
Cindy Lee | Daily Trojan
Noticing the lack of recycling bins in many houses on The Row led Panhellenic to realize it should become more involved with sustainability, according to Zara Abrams, vice president of scholarship for Panhellenic. Abrams said the campaign was started by a former vice president of philanthropy.
“This year, Panhellenic decided it should be a priority to rejuvenate our efforts toward sustainability, so we’re focusing on strengthening and re-launching the campaign,” Abrams said.
Beginning today, Panhellenic delegates from every house will be selling green merchandise such as reusable plastic water bottles, reusable coffee thermoses, grocery tote bags and tank tops.
Each item will feature a design with the popular “reuse, reduce, recycle” symbol or other nature- inspired art designed by Mallory Sparr, vice president of communications for Panhellenic.
“The idea is to promote sustainable habits through a campaign that also encourages Greek unity,” Abrams said. “We really want to emphasize the importance of working together as a larger community to make a difference.”
Claire Staggs, a freshman majoring in accounting and a member of Alpha Delta Pi sorority said she thinks this is a good campaign because it will show non-Greek students that the Greek community is focused on an important cause.
The proﬁt from the sales will be used to launch a recycling program for The Row that will include placing recycling bins in each sorority and fraternity house.
Any remaining funds will be used to purchase stickers with the phrase “These Come From Trees” to place on paper towel dispensers, just as USG has already done on some dispensers around campus.
Some students are excited that student groups have begun to take charge with environmental issues.
“Judging by USC’s last sustainability report, we need major improvement,” said Steven Alhadef, a sophomore majoring in communication and a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.
Though the university has been steadily improving, USC received a B- on its 2011 sustainability report. In 2010, the university received a C+ and in 2007, a D.
Panhellenic plans to partner with the Multicultural Greek Council, CalPIRG and the Ofﬁce of Sustainability for later sustainability efforts, which might include a tree planting program.
CalPIRG also hopes to create a competition to see which house can reduce its energy footprint the most.
The sorority and fraternity to lower its energy consumption the most would have a mixer together, according to Abrams.
Panhellenic also plans to present other environmentally friendly events throughout the semester.
Currently, Panhellenic is planning a Greek service event on Earth Day, April 22, to continue raising awareness about sustainability.
Ayushi Gummadi, president of Panhellenic, said the main goal of the campaign is to create awareness.
“If we accomplish this in a smaller form, then maybe the rest of campus can follow this lead in their daily lives,” Gummadi said.
Each house will be able to order the products online at Kotisdesign.com. Panhellenic plans to continue the sale until around March 25.
I think this is great.
Demand more recycling containers on your campus. 
Americans dispose of 300 billion bottles and can each year. 
Tell your campus facility director “Everywhere there is a trash can there should be a recycling container”!
How about every frat doesn’t use a few thousand red plastic cups every Thursday night? That would make a real difference.
It’s great to hear about college students going green!  Good for the whole Greek system and the university.  Going from a D to a B- in 4 years shows some major improvement.

Students in the freshman seminar “It Ought to be Law” successfully introduced a bill to the California state Senate that would make it mandatory for all public high schools in the state to have automatic external defibrillators available.
Senate Bill 63 has been introduced into the California State Senate by Senator Curren Price (D-Los Angeles), who represents the area surrounding USC.
The bill also stipulates all school-sponsored athletic events have AEDs available for use, schools have an emergency plan in place and school officials take a certified training course to operate an AED.
Professor Nina Rathbun and former State Sen. Kevin Murray teach the class, which has two sessions, with a combined 21 students enrolled.
“The entire class is about learning the political system, and in particular, the California state political system, through the practical experience of introducing [a] bill, and lobbying for it, and following it through,” Rathbun said.
Students were asked to brainstorm ideas for a bill the first few class sessions. They then chose the issue of AEDs as their focus after hearing about a student-athlete in Texas who experienced sudden cardiac arrest, but whose life was saved because of an AED, according to Rathbun.
“I have a friend who suffered from cardiac arrest on a football field in my neighborhood, and almost died from that,” said Emily Welch, a freshman in the class who is majoring in economics and English. “A law was passed very similar to the law that we are trying to pass … We all decided that this was something we wanted to see through in California.”
The bill was drafted entirely by students, and students conducted their own research on the subject of cardiac arrest.
Murray is USC’s politician-in-residence, and used his experience in the Senate to help students understand the legislative process.
“Senator Murray has been a driving force in pushing the students to act professionally and helping them know what the next step is,” Rathbun said.
Price introduced the bill to the Senate in early January.
The bill was referred to the Education and Health Committees on March 3, and is currently in the Education Committee.
The class is planning to fly to Sacramento on March 23 to give testimony to the Senate, according to Rathbun.
“It’s quite likely that the bill will get out of committee which is the next step, and I think that it has a fairly good chance of passage,” Rathbun said. “The major issue will not be substantive, but financial.”
The bill mandates that costs related to the AEDs will be funded by the state “if the Commission on State Mandates determines that [the] act contains costs mandated by the state.”
Students said the chance to work on real legislation has been invaluable.
“It was an incredible opportunity,” said Navtaj Singh, a freshman student in the class majoring in political science. “Creating a bill, learning the type of language used to come up with it, [learning] the costs we have to be aware of and learning about the other aspects leading up to the presenting the bill to the Committee and the Senate.”
It’s Navtej* Singh.

A non-USC man in his 20s was shot in the stomach in a drive-by shooting near the corner of 29th and Hoover Streets early Saturday morning.
The victim was shot outside of a private party at 1162 W. 29th St. around 12:30 a.m. He ran down 29th before collapsing in front of Regent Apartments, a USC-owned housing complex. Dept. of Public Safety and LAPD officers responded immediately.
Louis Wright, a resident of 1162 W. 29th St., confirmed there was a party being held at the house at the time of the incident.
Wright said he had turned several people away from the party in the minutes leading up to the shooting.
“There was a party going on and people couldn’t get in because they were too intoxicated,” Wright said. “We turned them away, and then there were some shots.”
Some students who had been at a nearby party on 29th said they had heard an argument outside just before they heard the gunshots.
Erica Dolcini, a senior majoring in policy, planning and development, said the argument prompted her and others at the party to call DPS. While they were on the phone with DPS they heard the sound of shots being fired.
“It’s kind of terrifying because it’s one of those moments where you just don’t know how quickly they were going to respond,” Dolcini said, adding that everyone in the house moved away from the windows as soon as they heard the gunshots.
Students who were in the area at the time reported hearing several gunshots in quick succession — most students said they heard between four and six shots.
Jacob Copman, a sophomore majoring in international relations and chemical engineering who was on the corner of 29th and Orchard Avenue at the time of the shooting, said he heard six gunshots and saw six LAPD officers rush to the scene within seconds.
Most officers had left the scene by 1:30 a.m.
DPS never issued a Trojans Alert about the shooting, a decision that upset many students.
“The fact that no one bothered to maybe alert me or assure me that everything would be alright I think is completely unacceptable,” said Ryan Morris, a sophomore majoring in business administration who lives in Sunset Apartments on 29th, in the same block where the shooting occurred.
“I understand that we live in an urban environment and I chose to come to USC knowing that, but it almost seems as if they were trying to conceal it by not informing students.”
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said DPS chose not to send the Trojans Alert because there was no USC involvement in the incident.
“It appears that someone was specifically targeted, and at this point it didn’t appear that anyone from USC would have been an intended target, which is why the Trojan Alert didn’t go out,” Carlisle said. “It was not considered to be an ongoing threat.”
Some students, however, said that because many students live on 29th or walk by that area, DPS should have alerted the USC community to what had happened.
“Probably 99 percent of residents on 29th Street are students, so to state that students were not involved is not responsible,” Morris said.
Additionally, students who heard the gunshots go off said they would have appreciated knowing if it was safe to go outside.
“While it may not have been an ongoing threat, if they don’t tell us that, we don’t know,” said Meg Manning, a junior majoring in cinematic arts-critical studies. “If students see police cars and streets blocked off it allows our imaginations to run wild and cause more panic than letting us know the reality of the situation. I think not informing students causes panic.”
The victim was transported to the hospital and is currently in stable condition, according to an LAPD spokesperson.
No arrests have been made in the case. The incident has been classified as non-gang related.
Lauren March contributed to this report.
Its all about USC image and keeping that overpriced tuition money rolling in.
There are so many things wrong with this situation, it’s infuriating.
Shame on DPS if they think for even a second that they were justified in not issuing an alert following the incident. It didn’t appear that anyone from USC was an intended target? What, do we wait until a USC student gets attacked before we act concerned? (Maybe some of you will recall when a student was stabbed and killed two years ago in the same vicinity — seems DPS has forgotten). So the shooting wasn’t on campus- but that doesn’t get DPS off the hook if they really are serving their purpose: “the primary goal of DPS is to provide a safe and secure environment in which the social and academic endeavors of the University community may be fully realized” (USC CAPS Website). As a student who lives in this area, I’m enraged that DPS will make it a routine to come and trespass onto our house’s private property (i.e. not owned or managed by USC whatsoever) to shut down our party over “noise complaints”, writing kids up for being disorderly (again, not on USC property, but on private property); and that they will send out an abundance of Trojan Alerts telling me that electricity in select campus buildings will be shut off for a few hours over the weekend, but when when there’s a risk of violence and USC students are in fear of their safety, no one hears a peep from them. The least they could’ve done was sent a message letting students know when the situation was safe and under control. No USC involvement my left foot– there is no excuse for failing to perform one’s duty. Have no doubts about it, DPS, you failed.
I’d feel safer if students would put together a voluntary patrol organization and walk a beat themselves.
Enraged.? I believe DPS does a good job. Managing this many students can’t be easy, ever watch the tv show Campus PD?  College students are not always known for making high IQ choices, ask the locals they are amazed by the students behavior.
Im angry at the criminals not the police or DPS. Maybe u should do a ride along with them on a busy night, u might learn a few things.
I totally agree.  As a concerned parent, it is frightening to think our children could have been placed in danger. What is the purpose of Trojan Alert if not to be used in situations like this? Hopefully more parents and students will express their concerns.
I agree. My daughter lived at 29th and Elenadale for 2 years, and it  concerns me that no one in DPS would have notified the neighboring students that there was a problem…….. Aren’t you responsible for the safety of the students?  Or is that just lip sergvice?

Defensive end Armond Armstead is being hospitalized in order to undergo tests for an undisclosed medical condition, according to USC coach Lane Kiffin.
“Armond Armstead was admitted to USC University Hospital yesterday to undergo tests for a medical condition,” Kiffin said Friday on USCRipsIt.com. “His situation is being evaluated and tests are continuing.  USC’s outstanding team of doctors is providing him with excellent medical care.”
Armstead and his family have asked that no other details regarding his illness be released.
“I saw Armond and his family this morning,” Kiffin added. “He is in great spirits and in stable condition.  He is looking forward to getting back with his teammates soon.”
Armstead was previously a defensive tackle but was switched to defensive end in 2009.
He recorded 43 tackles and three sacks in 12 games for the Trojans last season.
Armstead decided not to enter the NFL draft and will be returning for his senior season this year. He is expected to start at defensive end. Spring practices for USC begin on March 22.

Fans of Ingrid Michaelson, Sara Bareilles and KT Tunstall will enjoy the similar musical stylings of up-and-comer Katie Costello. The 20-year-old pop and alternative singer/songwriter recently released her second full-length album, Lamplight, to mixed reviews.
Searching · Katie Costello’s newest album, Lamplight, contains some hidden gems, but mostly shows her struggle to make herself stand out. - Photo courtesy of Tiny Tiny Records 
Costello’s voice is silky and her songs are beautifully melodic. Yet, on the first few listens, I couldn’t help but feel wary.
Perhaps it’s because I am a devoted Ingrid Michaelson fan, but I could not shake the thought that Costello’s sound is a shallow echo of Michaelson’s, who has endorsed the new artist.
Michaelson even tweeted, “If you are looking for a cute blonde babe to soothe you with her maple syrup voice look no further than @katiemusic. new album rox.”
Costello has blonde pixie hair and a mismatched, cool style. She is a self-proclaimed “song doodler, inter-web philosopher, absurdist and music farmer.”
It’s quirky, it’s cute and it’s a lot like the angle everybody else is taking.
Costello resembles Michaelson, Bareilles and the whole host of currently popular alternative, poppy female artists. Without their shadow, Costello would be incredibly intriguing, since her off-beat style and classic-turned-pop vocals are remarkable.
Unfortunately, this narrow genre has become too popular, and is currently ruled by the aforementioned giants.
On the positive side, Costello is notably talented in her own right and Lamplight’s 12 tracks are diverse, with several stand-outs.
“Out of Our Minds” and “Ashes Ashes” are inspired and excellent lay-on-your-bed-looking-up-at-the-ceiling kinds of songs. Costello gets the listener in a  contemplative mood as she sings let’s get out of our minds today /and take a little time to look at the stars and the moon above.
“Ashes Ashes” is more lighthearted, as Costello mimics the rhythm of the nursery school tune, “Ring Around the Rosy,” with lines like ashes, ashes, we fall and float away.
“Cassette Tape,” however, is an immature diary of social anxiety, which is entertaining at face value but becomes too  inexperienced when Costello sings, I wish there was a social excuse to make you a cassette tape.
Despite such self-indulgent statements, Costello is surprisingly affable and more mature than she gives herself credit for.
She is an observer, with deep insights into human character, as demonstrated in “Old Owl.” She sings cold by the fireplace’s haunting gold size / You are dwarfed by your own self-loathing, ambitious tendencies. It is this brand of songwriting that could help really set her apart from other similar singer songwriters.
Costello posted on her Facebook that she “writes songs that are meant to be revisited and experienced over and over again,” and that her “music seems to reward those who are searching and wanting something more than what is presented at the surface.”
Yet, Lamplight is a mixed bag that doesn’t reflect this thought process and Costello’s potential.
Her music has a pure quality, as well as an appealing honesty and vulnerability. But she needs to turn off her radio and avoid being an inadvertent copy-cat.
Costello’s sound in Lamplight reflects the comfortable niche she and dozens of other popular songstresses have fallen into. It’s tired and holding Costello back from noteworthiness.
Still, she is young and has plenty of time to settle into a distinctive style all her own.
Lamplight shines brighter than this first effort, Kaleidoscope Machine, though songs from that album have been featured on 90210, One Tree Hill and Private Practice.
Costello has a sort of captivating quality and energy that transcends her somewhat lackluster compositions. Hopefully, her next album will reflect her untapped maturity and insight on life’s deeper experiences.

D o the words “fitness” and “video game” really go together?
According to the recent craze in exercise video games, the answer is an indisputable ‘yes.’
Over the years, improved motion sensor technology has allowed the video game world to transform our lazy living rooms into gyms and dance floors.
The idea of integrating exercise with video games isn’t  particularly new. In 1988, Nintendo released the Power Pad, a mat with foot-sized buttons designed for running and jumping.
Now, instead of bulky mats or unresponsive dance pads, we have more precise and convenient tools like the Wii Balance Board and the Xbox Kinect.
But nobody wants to fork over a week’s paycheck for a video game without seeing results. And what if you only have an Xbox 360 or a PlayStation 3? What’s the best video game for your specific console? More importantly, when choosing a console, which one gives you the most freedom to build a workout and really move around?
These are the top fitness video games on the market for each of the three major game consoles:
Wii Fit Plus (Nintendo Wii)
If you own a Wii, Wii Fit Plus is by far one of the best investments you can make. Though it costs almost $100 for the actual game and the balance board, the results you see are worth the investment.
The video game uses the Wii Balance Board to measure your weight and body mass index. Players then stand on the board and select from a variety of workouts to perform, such as yoga and aerobics.
The game’s best feature is its flexibility in building routines. Wii Fit Plus allows you to take free reign of your workout regimen by letting you combine mini-games and exercises, depending on the areas of your body you want to focus on most.
Like other Nintendo titles, the mini-games are creative and exciting. One forces you to flap your wings to fly whereas another makes you hula-hoop.
The game is a considerable improvement from the original Wii Fit, with a handful of new mini-games and balance exercises that help create a fun and effective workout.
Your Shape Fitness Evolved (Xbox 360)
Balance board unappealing? Try the Xbox’s Your Shape Fitness Evolved.
The game utilizes the Xbox’s Kinect sensor, so your body alone is the controller. The sensor uses player projection technology to pinpoint millions of dots along your body, which allows you to directly interact with the elements on the screen.
Yes, that’s right, no bulky balance board, no dance pad and no controller. You get to move, dance, kick and punch your way through levels and to better health.
Like Wii Fit Plus, Your Shape Fitness Evolved comes with dozens of fun, interactive workouts, such as martial arts, dancing or tai chi. Unlike Wii Fit Plus, however, the Xbox 360 allows you to download new exercise routines to keep you from falling into a rut.
If you’re a proponent of working out with friends, Your Shape Fitness Evolved also allows for multiplayer functions via Xbox LIVE.
Zumba Fitness (PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii and Xbox 360)
For those who don’t own a Wii or Xbox 360, PlayStation 3’s version of Zumba Fitness is one of the best options on the video game exercise market.
Capitalizing on the nation’s new craze with the Latin-inspired dance system called Zumba, Zumba Fitness challenges you to move and stay in sync with the beat.
Although the game doesn’t boast a wide variety of workouts as Wii Fit Plus or Your Shape Fitness Evolved, it contains a satisfying number of interesting dance styles, from hip-hop to flamenco.
Unfortunately, the PlayStation 3 lacks the more sophisticated technology of the Wii or Xbox 360.
Playing the game requires wearing a somewhat frustrating motion sensor belt around your waist. The belt is relatively accurate but less convenient than the Xbox 360’s Kinect.
Still, priced at $40, the game is a decent alternative to the more efficient Wii Fit Plus and Your Shape Fitness Evolved. In Zumba Fitness, players follow a dance instructor.
The accuracy of the players’ moves is highlighted by different colors. Like other dance-oriented games in the past, it can be frustrating trying to stay exactly in sync with the steps onscreen. But the drive for perfection is still guaranteed to make you break a sweat.
With so many choices, it doesn’t matter which consoles you have access to. There’s no excuse not to join in on this video game exercise frenzy.

How many plays require a designated “splash zone?”
Theater fans hungry for a revitalizing thrill or hoping to convert their non-theatergoing friends cannot afford to miss Re-Animator: The Musical, which will be playing at the Steve Allen Theater all this month. 
Re-Animator: The Musical, directed by filmmaker Stuart Gordon and based on his 1985 film adapted from a story by H.P. Lovecraft, tells the story of Herbert West (Graham Skipper), a medical student who manages to bring the dead back to life with a serum he has invented. This feat, however, is marred by horrific side effects that render the undead dangerous, volatile zombies.
Needless to say, this isn’t your typical subject for a theatre production.
Gordon’s science-fiction gore fest, however, makes a surprisingly good transition from the screen to musical theater, a success owed to the interesting story, comedy and creative use of the limited stage space.
The Steve Allen Theater, which is a small, intimate venue, was packed on opening night, with people sitting on extra chairs and standing in the walkway.
Within the first few minutes after the lights dimmed, people who decided to sit in the first three rows were squirted with fake blood.
The play appeared to be charmingly — and intentionally — low-quality in aesthetics. The gory special effects and props like fake brains were hilariously conspicuous. When characters were supposed to be thrown around or torn apart they are noticeably swapped with dummies. Similarly, when Dan Cain (Chris L. McKenna) has to fight off a rabid undead cat, he is clearly wrestling with a stuffed animal.
Out of the entire cast, Graham Skipper stands out most. He is enjoyable to watch and managed to endow West’s character with multiple layers ranging from borderline insanity, to genius, ambition and creepiness, with a generous dose of likeability. Not to mention his singing is commendable as well.
It was interesting to see how the musical aspect was handled, given that the film does not tell a type of story often told in a musical theater setting.
The songs, however, were surprisingly good.
They greatly enhanced the comedy while showcasing the cast members, who, while not opera singers, were still very talented.
The song topics covered everything from marriage to basements to bringing the dead back to life.
The second act, which is the collective climax of the film, contains most of the action, including a dance by a chorus of reanimated corpses, despite clocking in at barely 40 minutes.
There is also much more gratuitous gore.
People sitting in or near the “splash zone” were drenched with fake blood as certain cast members made sure to hit their target audience as much as possible. Even Skipper accidentally slipped in a puddle of fake blood in one of his scenes.
Still, Re-Animator: The Musical is not nearly as gruesome as one might expect, at least when compared to the original film. Those who are squeamish might opt to see the play instead.
In fact, with the singing and additional comedy added, Gordon’s stage production is arguably more entertaining than its viscera-splattered source material.
Anyone who enjoys dark comedies, gore, science-fiction, musicals or who simply wants to add some life to the weekend, will enjoy the show.
The Steve Allen Theatre is located on 4773 Hollywood Blvd.

Students at a party on 29th Street on Friday night hit the ground when they heard gunshots fired around 12:30 a.m. They didn’t know what was happening or if they were safe.
And because USC’s Dept. of Public Safety never issued a Trojans Alert, those students were never given an easy way to get answers to the array of questions raised by the sound of gunfire.
DPS officials said they chose not to send out a Trojans Alert because there was no USC involvement in the shooting, which involved a non-USC male who had been attending a non-USC party.
That decision, however, fails to consider the large number of students who live in the 29th Street area and who walk down 29th on a Friday night.  It is irresponsible of DPS not to have done everything it could to inform students of a serious crime in the area.
Although the incident did not involve the university, there is no way students who were in the area at the time could have known that.
Even students who didn’t hear the gunshots noticed the heavy police presence and heard the helicopters overhead. Many wondered what had happened, but they didn’t have access to the information they needed. A Trojans Alert could have reassured students they were not in danger.
Additionally, whenever someone is shot, it would be prudent for DPS to alert students, especially when the shooter is not immediately apprehended.
One student, concerned by the sounds of gunshots and helicopters, said she called DPS and was advised to stay inside. If they were telling students who called not to go outside, why not tell the whole university community?
Admittedly, every Trojans Alert runs the risk of causing unwarranted panic. Nonetheless, student safety is paramount, and it must be the first  — and only — consideration for DPS.
Students should have received one Trojans Alert immediately saying there had been a shooting, and one later indicating the scene had been cleared and it was safe to walk down 29th Street.
Though no one involved in the shooting was affiliated with the university, the fact that it happened in an area where the majority of residents are students makes the incident USC-related, and students deserve to be informed.
This is hardly the first time dps has refused to tell us about pertinent neighborhood happenings.  Yes, we’re students.  Yes the event was not involving students.  But more importantly, we all live in the same area and interact with non-students very frequently.  Incidents like these are relevant to us!
DPS you stand by and watch enough as it is right now, so please step it up and at least tell us what’s going on where we live!  That way at least we can protect ourselves since it’s clear that you won’t do it for us.
– annoyed
Don’t worry…. if you’re at USC long enough, you’ll experience more wonderful DPS moments like this.
Case in point? I was stalked by a fellow student in my freshman year. While going through the official process and setting up a meeting with DPS, my stalker found out and decided to call the emergency line and say that I was threatening him. Guess who wouldn’t listen to me when my official meeting came around, and told me that I would face punishment if I “threatened” him again?
Needless to say, their actions in this incident don’t surprise me at all.
DPS is USELESS! They are supposed to be here for “PUBLIC SAFETY,” yet when a violent crime happens 2 blocks away from my apartment, the only way I hear about it is from other students, not the people who are supposed to be looking out for our safety. Simply pathetic!
yes, DPS should have sent out an alert to students. Finding out the next morning about a shooting that occurred at a nearby street is unacceptable.
From a USC parent:
Recent calls to USC regarding concern about off campus housing for upcoming sophomores are “dissed”.  Is it any wonder why we are concerned?  If DPS can’t alert our students, they are sitting ducks. L.A. is not the safest place for our students.
My son called me immediately after he heard the shots, which occured just two houses away.  I was stunned and very worried, of course, and then very angry that there was not a Trojan Alert to let us know he was safe.  How did any of us know the gunman wasn’t still in the neighborhood?  How did we know there wasn’t going to be a response from the victim’s friends?   Better to err on the side of too much information!
DPS is awesome! Trust me folks…
So do you work for DPS, are related to someone who works for DPS or just think this is a humorous topic?
DPS has been inadequate and non-resonsive (n any meaningful way) for all six years that I’ve had students here. Time for a change.
DPS really dropped the ball on this one. We get Trojan alerts about power outages and earthquake drills, but not about a shooting in an area where most of the student population lives? Totally irresponsible!

USC can hire some of the most intelligent, accomplished and admired professors in the nation, but if students fail to show up for classes, the net benefit to both faculty and students remains zero.
Cindy Lee | Daily Trojan
The Center for Excellence in Teaching held a panel discussion recently about how to improve student attendance overall by identifying why students choose not to attend class and giving suggestions as to how professors can improve the situation.
As a student, it seems a feeling of personal relavance could increase classroom attendance and enjoyment.
In classes in which attendance and participation do not factor into the final grade, the number of students populating the classroom always seems to decrease steadily week by week. A lecture section with 200 registered students might only host 50 by the middle of the semester.
Many experts agree attending class is crucial for doing well in a class. A 2005 study by the University of Illinois showed a significant negative correlation between grades and attendance, and other studies have produced similar results.
But the usefulness of lectures really hinges on whether or not the lecture is effective in supplementing textbook material and not merely a rehashing the required reading.
Why should I spend an hour listening to a lethargic reiteration of what I could power through in twenty minutes? I could use the other forty minutes for something truly valuable, like a nap.  
Students might choose to skip class not completely out of laziness, but because they feel nothing occurs during class that is important enough to merit attendance.
On days with midterms, I suddenly discover an additional 10-20 or so people I never knew were part of my class before.
We clearly have lecture sections for a reason, however. Lectures are a time for the professor to nuance the textbook with different perspectives, to offer his or her own angle on the subjects and to contextualize the information.
Lectures can also add a more visual or discussion-oriented setting for students to supplement reading. Class should not be designed as an an optional review session or a convenient place to nap or study for another class.
Of course, while we students are reasonably willing to sleepily wander to class if we feel it will honestly help us for the exams, it becomes much easier to drag our eyelids open at 9 a.m. if we actually enjoy the class.
We are much more likely to attend classes that we find personally relevant to our interests or particularly important to current affairs will usually have better attendance rates than classes that feature powerpoints taken word-for-word from the textbook.
For professors, there are two general methods for increasing student attendance.
Professors who allocate points for attendance usually find a consistent number of students in the classroom each time. Other techniques include giving small pop quizzes, having homework assignments due at the beginning of class, or using in-class assignments and clicker questions.
Additionally, instead of basing exams solely on required reading material,  and thereby rendering any additional information covered in lecture irrelevant, professors could design midterms to afford better holistic coverage of the course material.
Professors could also try to engage the students in more active participation through student discussions. Through discussion, students gain additional perspectives from their peers while examining the course material from alternative angles.
Increased student attendance does not only benefit students, but faculty as well.
Professors and teaching assistants receive feedback on their teaching abilities and often learn new things about their area of research by cultivating a student audience and engaging their students in critical discussions. But if they are teaching to a deserted classroom, it becomes a waste of everyone’s time.
The professor might as well return home and take a nap, too.

I don’t think that these are all of the reasons that students don’t show up for class; you’re making it sound as if the only options are lazy students or lazy staff not making the material interesting enough. From talking to my fellow classmates, I often find that many miss class in order to study for other classes or to do interviews or are simply burnt out–laziness is really not a factor in those cases.
Don’t get me wrong, lecture is really important; I mean, we are paying ungodly high amounts per unit for four units a class, so we should be there. But sometimes it’s difficult to find time to balance class attendance with doing well in all of the classes.
People are going to do what works and if they can get away with missing lecture and do well, if not better, in their classes, they won’t come. Please don’t interpret that to mean make things more difficult. :)
It’s all contingent on many variables:
-the student’s character
-the professor’s lecture style
-the difficulty of the class
-the major
etc. 
You can’t please everyone; this is college, not babysitting. I didn’t achieve a competitive GPA while a student at SC, hence I blame myself, not externals.

Lupe Fiasco went through a long waiting period for his newest album, Lasers, to receive an okay from Atlantic Records for its release.
His last album, The Cool, shot him into the mainstream scene, but Atlantic still considered it a failure. Lupe wanted to work hard to mold his next album into something really classic, authentic and different, but his label had other ideas.
“You can approach it in a very sleazy way – just throw money at it, go get a lot of the big-name artists, let them hijack it for you and just ride that wave into success,” he told The Guardian. “The label wanted to do it the sleazy way.”
Atlantic didn’t seem to be on his side at all and almost drove him to be slightly suicidal, he told The Guardian. Most people don’t know it, but “Nothin’ On You,” B.o.B.’s biggest hit, was originally Lupe’s, just with different verses. The label told him his verses were “wack” and B.o.B., who was a guest on the original track along with Bruno Mars, ended up writing new ones that Atlantic approved of.
Incidents such as that and Atlantic shelving his upcoming album drove him to thinking suicidal thoughts. Fortunately, with the help of his fans, a petition with about 30,000 signatures demanded the release of Lasers.
Lasers will hit stores this Tuesday.

Only two years ago Rubina Ali won moviegoers’ hearts in the younger role of Latika in Slumdog Millionare and was the darling of the Oscars along with younger costars from the film. But Friday night the Slumdog star lost all six trophies and much more in a fire that swept through the Mumbai slum, which according to AFP left more than 2,000 homeless.
“All my daughter’s clothes including what she wore for the Oscars were burnt in the fire.  We could hardly save anything,” the 12-year-old’s father told The Times of India.
“We spent the entire night in the railway station,” Ali said.  “So far nobody has come to help us.”
Due to the blockbuster and critic success of the 2008 film winning eight Oscars, the director Danny Boyle set up the Jai Ho Trust.
The trust is for children living in the slum of Garib Nagar and is also giving Ali an education and building her family a new home, which is still yet to be completed.
Apparently, the locals were unhappy with all the attention Ali was receiving, telling The Times of India, “[We] don’t know why people are only giving them importance.  There are hundreds of families that have lost everything and hundreds of children who are homeless.”
