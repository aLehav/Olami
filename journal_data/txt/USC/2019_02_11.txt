It’s almost that time of year again. Hundreds of hopeful high school students will soon tour USC, attend Explore USC and ultimately make one of the most important decisions of their academic careers: where to attend college. 
Naturally, many of these students consider a university’s ranking and financial aid offerings when deciding where they will spend the next four years. For many, the decision comes down to paying the least for the highest-ranked school. 
But it is not always easy to strike a balance between these factors. The main reason is that the way the U.S. News and World Report ranks colleges fundamentally puts middle class students at an admissions and financial aid disadvantage. 
The U.S. News and World Report slightly altered the way it ranks colleges in 2019, adding weight to a category they call “social mobility,” which refers to how many low-income students are enrolled and actually graduate. In measuring low-income, however, the ranking uses students who received Pell grants as its only metric. It’s true that there needs to be a line drawn somewhere between social classes and federal Pell grants are a standardized place to do so. Students who are eligible to receive Pell grants come from families that make less than $50,000 a year and most come from families that make under $20,000 per year. 
But where does this leave families with yearly household incomes of, say, $51,000? Stuck with nothing, according to data analyzed by Caroline Hoxby and Sarah Turner, economists at Stanford University and the University of Virginia, respectively. Hoxby and Turner gathered admissions data nation wide and observed how results changed from 2008 — when rankings incentives to enroll more Pell grant recipients were nonexistent — to 2016.
It doesn’t take an expert data analyst to understand how a “V”-shaped admissions curve has slowly formed. Colleges are mainly enrolling students whose families are either not well off (Pell grant recipients), or students whose families are very well-off and can pay tuition at sticker price. It should be noted that the left side of the “V” is higher, meaning there are more Pell grant students than well-off students who are enrolled. But ultimately, everyone in the middle of these two extremes is disadvantaged. 
Turner said the data shows institutions are “actively targeting Pell grant recipients,” and they are almost certainly giving their limited, additional financial aid dollars to these students as opposed to students whose families make just a few thousand dollars more. Even families making $100,000 per year, twice the income of the highest-earning Pell grant recipients, cannot easily afford to spend over 60 percent of their yearly earnings on a college tuition. 
“If you’re a student who’s just above [the Pell threshold], you still need just as much financial aid as somebody who is just below,” Turner told Inside Higher Ed. “We know that there’s distortion going on there.”
Students are told from a young age that if they do well in school, they will be rewarded for their achievements with acceptance into a top university. This path, in essence, represents what the American Dream used to. But too often,  middle-class parents all over the country have to tell their children, “We can’t afford the American Dream. We can’t afford your dream school.” 
Thankfully, some elite schools like USC offer merit-based aid, based entirely on the academic performance and ability of incoming students, regardless of family income. USC is one of few schools that has the endowment — and desire — to provide this type of aid. But USC does not get rewarded for its generosity in the U.S. News and World Report rankings, meaning there is little incentive for other universities to follow suit. 
British economist Charles Goodhart coined a theory about controlling a statistical irregularity that can be best summarized as the following: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. His theory applies in remarkable fashion to college rankings: “social mobility” — what was once a measure — is now being manipulated precisely because it has become the target.

The No. 21 USC women’s lacrosse team defeated Hofstra University 15-10 Saturday afternoon in its season opener at McAlister Field. The Women of Troy scored 10 goals in the second half to put the Pride away. 
Hofstra kept the game tight in the first half, controlling the draw 7-3. After halftime, the Trojans exploded offensively, scoring 8 out of the first 9 goals, including 3 straight goals in 60 seconds. USC dominated the draw after the break, winning 75 percent of them. 
Head coach Lindsey Munday said she was happy with the team’s second-half adjustments.
“I think it was really just pushing the pace as much as we can,” Munday said. “We got some good looks off transition, and the draw controls were the biggest difference in the second half.”
Leading the way for Hofstra were junior midfielder Alyssa Parrella and sophomore attacker Katie Whelan. Whelan led the team in points with 5 from 4 goals and an assist. Parrella added 4 goals for the Pride, but she also had four costly turnovers. Hofstra freshman keeper Jess Smith saw a lot of action, facing 26 shots on goal and managing to save 11. 
Eight different Trojans scored in the game, with freshman midfielder Katie Ramsay leading the team in scoring with 3 goals on three shots along with an assist and four draw controls, an impressive debut for the player ranked No. 47 by Inside Lacrosse Women. ILWomen No. 2-ranked freshman midfielder Erin Bakes also impressed in her first collegiate game, scoring 2 goals on three shots. 
The Trojan attack had a nice distribution, as each of the starting attackers scored 2 goals. Junior attacker and team captain Izzy McMahon controlled the offense, slowing down the pace when the team needed to settle after a long defensive possession. Senior attacker Emily Concialdi also pitched in with 2 goals and an assist. 
The Trojan defense played cohesively, forcing the Pride into four shot clock violations. Senior captain and draw specialist Jackie Gilbert led the unit with three ground balls. Gilbert said she is excited to lead this particular bunch of players.
“To be voted captain means the world to me,” Gilbert said. “To be a captain from my recruiting year is just the best feeling, and knowing I have my teammate’s support makes it that much better.”
Sophomore goalie Riley Hertford stepped up for the defense, saving nearly half of the shots she faced in goal. Last year, only the top 13 goalies in the nation achieved that benchmark. Having joined the team as the ILWomen No. 13-ranked freshman in 2018, Gilbert’s immediate success isn’t surprising. 
“Riley really stepped up, especially in the second half, and really made some huge saves that were momentum turners,” Munday said.
Next, the Trojans play San Diego State on the road Feb. 22 at 1 p.m.

After a close matchup throughout the game, USC fell to Colorado 69-65 at home due to poor shooting Saturday night.
The Trojans showcased their improved ball movement in the opening possessions of the game. After poor passing and shot selection against Utah, the Trojans appeared to bring a more patient mindset. They also played well on the defensive end, holding Colorado to 3 points in the first few minutes of the game.
The Trojans were unable to expand their lead over the Buffaloes due to a scoring slump. However, the team continued to move the ball around and force turnovers. After seven minutes of play, USC was ahead 12-11.
Both teams were held to 14 points through the first 10 minutes of the game, and their shooting struggles led to increased defensive efforts. Junior forward Nick Rakocevic was a major factor, as he was aggressive on the glass, capturing two offensive rebounds early in the game.
Senior guard Shaqquan Aaron was also a crucial facilitator as the Trojans gained a 21-19 lead over Colorado. Aaron had two straight assists, breaking down the defense and passing it out to junior Derryck Thornton for an open 3-pointer in the first instance. On the following possession, Aaron passed the ball to freshman guard Kevin Porter, who excited the crowd with a smooth reverse layup.
Aaron put an exclamation point on a strong first half performance with a 3-point play to tie the game at 26-26 with two minutes left. He drove into the Buffaloes defense, drawing contact and finishing the play with a free throw.
The Trojans tied the close matchup in the final seconds of the first half with another 3-point play. Porter attacked the basket in transition, making the layup and free throw. Overall, the Trojans shot poorly, but individual efforts tied the score at 29-29 by the end of the half.
Senior forward Bennie Boatwright opened the second-half scoring for the Trojans with a mid-range shot. He then intercepted a pass, and junior guard Jonah Mathews finished the play for a 33-31 lead two minutes in.
The Trojans continued to move the ball well with assisted scoring drives from Rakocevic and Boatwright. However, Colorado took the lead over USC with 5 straight points. The Buffaloes were ahead 44-39 with 13 minutes left in the second half.
Boatwright answered this Colorado run with a 2- and 3-pointer in consecutive possessions. The two teams battled to obtain a substantial lead, but neither could pull away. 
Colorado freshman forward Evan Battey was a strong presence from the inside. He forced physical play from Rakocevic and caused him to sit out with foul trouble. With Rakocevic off the court, Aaron stepped up and hit two big 3-pointers. Colorado continued to press forward offensively, however, and USC was down 58-55 with six minutes left in the game.
In the final minutes of the game, both sides traded layups, keeping the game close. However, Colorado pulled ahead late with two free throws, and USC was unable to make the comeback.
“We had a couple of chances to win it or at least take the lead at the end,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “[The Buffaloes] were able to get to the rim and shoot two right-handed layups.”
Boatwright had a strong night with 24 points, five rebounds and four assists. Additionally, Aaron added 13 points with crucial shots down the stretch.
Colorado shot just 20 percent from the 3-point line, but USC was unable to take advantage due to its inefficient offense. Colorado also dominated on the glass, winning the rebounding battle 38-29. Rakocevic, who has been otherwise  solid this season, had just 8 points and six rebounds.
“[This game] came down to the wire, it could have gone either way,” Mathews said. “We need to keep playing and get some road wins.”
USC will go on the road to face Stanford at 8 p.m. Wednesday. The Trojans look to bounce back from this loss and re-establish themselves in the Pac-12 standings.

Immediately after the final buzzer sounded on USC’s 69-65 defeat to Colorado Saturday at Galen Center, Colorado head coach Tad Boyle turned to the Buffaloes supporters behind him in the stands and yelled emphatically in celebration. As he went through the handshake line with the USC coaching staff, Trojans associate head coach Jason Hart confronted Boyle, and the two exchanged words. 
“Supposedly,” USC head coach Andy Enfield said, “their coach swore at us, and that’s all I know.”
It was the continuation of a feud that stretches back to last season, when Boyle called Enfield out over USC’s recruiting practices. Enfield fired back with a statement and, during the teams’ next meeting, he called a timeout with 21 seconds left and USC ahead by 12 points to presumably rub in the victory. Boyle took exception to that and made it clear how much defeating USC Saturday meant to him.
“I meant no disrespect by it,” Boyle told reporters. “But this game meant a lot to me. I don’t forget what happened last year with the timeout.”
This quarrel is a microcosm of the Pac-12 season. Here are the men in charge of two programs that have been fairly mediocre this season, hovering around .500 in conference play, drumming up beef that nobody really cares about. There is zero buzz on campus surrounding the federal investigation into college basketball, which USC was involved in after former assistant coach Tony Bland was arrested in the fall of 2017. In January, Bland reached a plea deal on charges of conspiring to commit bribery to lure players to specific agents. 
But at a school where basketball barely registers on anyone’s radar, this story generated little interest — certainly not enough for two Pac-12 coaches to act petty following victories. And yet, there was Boyle, hollering like Colorado had just won the national championship rather than improved to 5-6 in an unimpressive conference.
Boyle to Saturday’s game was like the Pac-12 to the rest of the country: flailing its arms, kicking and screaming, attempting to stay relevant. One look at the standings is all it takes to figure out that this conference is, um, not good.
Washington, which won its first 10 conference games, couldn’t even claim a spot in the AP Top 25 — and it definitely won’t after falling to Arizona State on Saturday. There are three teams tied for second at 7-4 and then USC at 6-5. It would be one thing if the parity across the league was because all the teams were good and beating up on each other, but it is a problem if the parity is because the schools are equally bad.
Unfortunately, the latter is where the conference is at. Unless another team starts picking up steam down the stretch, the Pac-12 is looking at just one bid in the NCAA tournament — a woeful outcome for a Power 5 conference.
The marquee programs are struggling, and the best school, Washington, can’t get any national love despite being 10-1 in conference play. Arizona State, which knocked off No. 1 Kansas earlier this season, can’t seem to stay consistent. Arizona and Oregon aren’t even in contention. USC has dropped three of four after a three-game win streak showed the team’s flash of promise. Things have gotten so bad at UCLA that alumni and boosters are clamoring for former Louisville head coach Rick Pitino to take over the helm.
“There are a lot of teams [that], if they play well, can beat anybody in the league,” Enfield said. “If you don’t bring your best game, you can lose to anybody in the league. So there’s a lot of teams that, on any given night, can win by 10-15 points and maybe play the same team the next night and lose by 10-15.”
That is indeed the definition of parity, but not in a good sense. USC’s last seven games are a strong example. Last month, the Trojans rolled past UCLA, Arizona and ASU and jumped to second in the conference. But in the last week and half, they suffered a road loss at Washington and brutal back-to-back home defeats to Utah and Colorado.
Those were three games that USC had a chance of winning — and probably should have won. But they came down to a couple of plays: a bounce here, a make instead of a miss there. This is what separates an average team from a good team — the ability to close out games, to emerge from a tight battle victorious. In this regard, the Trojans have no consistency.
In a 69-67 win over ASU last month, senior captain Bennie Boatwright nailed a go-ahead 3-pointer in the clutch. In a 69-65 loss to Colorado Saturday, it was Boatwright and junior forward Nick Rakocevic — two team leaders — who allowed Buffaloes guard McKinley Wright to drive right past them for two crucial layups that gave Colorado the late lead.
“I don’t know why Nick and Bennie weren’t in the middle of [the] lane and hedging on the ball screen,” Enfield said. “It’s very shocking. Those guys are juniors and seniors — two big mental breakdowns in the last two minutes of the game. Not going to make excuses for them, because I can’t.”
It may have been shocking to Enfield, but, 11 games into conference play, USC’s standing is no longer a surprise to the neutral observer. USC is merely part of the group of Pac-12 teams mired in a “meh” season, one as uninspiring as the tepid crowds that have shown up at Galen Center. 
So, the hell with it, Tad Boyle. Bring on the petty drama, the unnecessarily exorbitant celebrations. This Pac-12 basketball season could use some life, anyway.

The Recording Academy’s 61st Annual Grammy Awards, also referred to as “Music’s Biggest Night,” took place Sunday night. For 60 years, the Grammys have sought to recognize the best the music industry has to offer. It is fitting (albeit shameful) then, that very few — if any — black gay musicians were represented at the ceremony, since they are seldom at the forefront of the music industry in the first place.
Sure, certain individuals have made an effort to make the industry more inclusive for everyone, but it seems as if self-identified black and gay musicians were left behind for decades. If the music business truly seeks to expand its reach and represent some of the finest musical craftsmen of this generation, then the next wave of stars should finally present a Gayoncé: a black and gay global superstar.
Historically, queer men of color have almost exclusively aligned themselves with female pop stars, especially women of color. Artists like Beyoncé, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna create music that exudes as much sass and shared cultural knowledge as would music made by gay black men. However, societal homophobia often prevents black gay musicians from reaching the same heights themselves, driving these men to pledge allegiance to black female musicians — arguably, the artists they see the most of themselves in. 
Similarly, musical representations of the LGBTQ+ community have largely consisted of white men and women. Queer perspectives are evident in songs by icons like Elton John, Freddie Mercury and Lady Gaga, but their music lacks pointed discussions of racism that black gay men are concerned with alongside homophobia. Thus, today’s musical lineup is missing a figure for those who are caught at the intersection. 
Thankfully, there are strides being made. Today, rising stars can be seen in self-identified queer black men like Kevin Abstract (of Brockhampton), Frank Ocean and Tyler, The Creator. Black gay songwriters like MNEK have benefitted from working with higher-profile acts, and there are also some musicians — such as Jaden Smith and Young Thug — who do not openly identify as queer but actively work to dismantle gender norms and homophobia.
Creating space for black gay artists will be beneficial for everyone. Of course, LGBTQ+ men and women of color will receive much-deserved cultural acknowledgement and visibility, but the music industry is also presented with the opportunity to tap into a mostly unacknowledged market sector. 
Gay men and women, especially those of color, are often driving forces behind the popular culture zeitgeist. “Voguing,” appropriated by Madonna and delivered to the masses, originated from black and Latinx gay men in the East Coast ballroom scene; they also spawned much of the vernacular that permeates reality television. The television show “Lip Sync Battle” was heavily inspired by “Ru Paul’s Drag Race.” Barry Jenkins’ “Moonlight” instantly became a pop culture juggernaut upon release. The music industry can leverage the viability of the black LGBTQ+ market for its own benefit while giving healthy representation to those who need it.
Black gay men and women are still routinely assaulted in public, and they comprise a large chunk of the homeless LGBTQ+ youth population. Every day, black and gay children, men and women must navigate the funk of homophobia “at home” in the black community, and casual racism in the overarching LGBTQ+ community. A public figure who understands these circumstances and can speak about them through a medium as powerful and far-reaching as music can potentially transform many lives. 
Working to amplify the voices of gay artists of color will only be helpful for the industry; there are myriad possibilities for marketing campaigns, pop-up shops, music videos and even entire cities that may have more economic promise for tours than usual due to their LGBTQ+ populations — which is good for touring and selling merchandise. Rap needs a Gay-Z, and pop deserves a Gayoncé. Representation is long overdue.

Some say pain makes for the best art. Some say true inspiration comes from the cathartic process of expelling one’s demons in healthy ways. Coming less than a year after the release of “Sweetener,” Ariana Grande attempts just that on her latest album — to rid herself of a tumultuous past.
With just 12 tracks, “Thank U, Next” leaves little room for error. A tightly woven project like this cannot include skippable songs or risk losing the listener’s attention. Unfortunately, this is the case from the start. The album opener — the previously released “Imagine” — is an underwritten and overproduced ballad that laments the loss of a relationship. Grande’s vocals shine, but digging for further depth leaves listeners disappointed.
This superficiality continues on “Needy” and “NASA,” both forgettable tracks with little originality.
“Needy” revolves around Grande’s clingy mentality in relationships, while “NASA” conversely presents a frustrated Grande needing space — through a too-obvious-to-miss metaphor of NASA and literal space. 
“I’ma need space, I’ma need space / N-A-S-A,” Grande quips.
The issue with both tracks lies not merely in their shallow lyrics, but rather in their lackluster production. “Needy” features a monotonous dreamscape (the likes of which were greatly improved upon in the later track, “Ghostin”), while “NASA” offers a cookie-cutter pop cadence. Tracks like these must make up for simplistic lyrics with compelling instrumentals, but both fail to provide exciting or fresh sounds.
The first sign of excitement on the record comes in the excellent, single-ready “Bloodline,” a tropical, horn-assisted banger. Grande cleverly toys with a lover here, jesting, “Don’t want you in my bloodline, yeah / Just wanna have a good time, yeah.” It’s also the first moment on the record when Grande herself seems to be having fun. 
The midsection of the album offers almost no compelling material, with Grande hovering over subject matter like fame-induced suffocation, misdirected self-medicating and rekindling romance.
 What sounds like a compelling array of topics is watered down by slang-driven lyricism replaced by the type of pop music that digs its claws into the consciousness, whether the listeners wants it to or not. Ultimately, Grande’s songs fail to offer listeners profound insight into the life of Grande.
The track “Ghostin,” however, offers a deeper look into her psyche, vulnerably conveying her turmoil at what seems to be the end of her relationship with comedian Pete Davidson. The track is beautifully produced and well-intentioned, though its adherence to the aforementioned contemporary internet slang (like the practice of “ghosting”) discredits the otherwise artful subject matter. 
The last third of “Thank U, Next” props up the entire album. The trap-influenced “In My Head” savagely, and at times distastefully, laments a relationship Grande unintentionally manipulated into seeming like more than it was. 
“I had a vision of seeing what isn’t there,” she recalls in the second verse. 
Ilya and Max Martin assist with the album’s production. “In My Head” closes with a thought-provoking outro reminiscent of Lorde’s “Melodrama.”
The finale sends the project off on a high note with Grande’s holy trinity of hit singles: “7 Rings,” “Thank U, Next” and, most recently, “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored.” The two previously released tracks find new meaning in the context of the tracklist, showcasing Grande’s growth and healing process despite the pain evident in the front half of the project. She hints at an exciting year with the closer “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored.” It’s stylish, playful and brings out Grande’s cool confidence.
“Thank U, Next” is by no means the masterpiece that fulfills the world’s high expectations. Its lyrics encapsulate the lack of substance perpetuated in mainstream music today. The album’s production is, for the most part, decidedly standard. 
What makes “Thank U, Next” a worthwhile listen, however, is Grande’s ability to concede vulnerability and own up to her mistakes. 
Dark and honest, the slim collection paints a portrait of a celebrity in an incredibly difficult position personally and publicly. The closing moments of the album present her strength and resilience — themes that naturally bookend an album desperately trying to be more profound than it is.

Last week, Maia and Alex Shibutani, two renowned Olympic figure skaters, spoke to students and alumni on campus. The event, hosted by the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly and the Performing Arts Committee, is part of a semester-long festival showcasing Asian Pacific American history, culture and community. 
While the talk was open to the public, the audience almost entirely comprised Asian students. Event attendance like this reveals a hidden disconnect between Asian students and the rest of the student body that can lead to misunderstandings of different cultural identities — this disconnect can only be ameliorated by more diverse participation. 
Just last month, an incident at Duke University exhibited blatant disregard of cultural identities by its administration that jeopardized the safety of minority groups on college campuses. Megan Neely, a faculty member at the Duke University School of Medicine, stepped down amid backlash regarding an email she sent urging Chinese students to speak English both in and outside of the classroom, reported The New York Times. 
The professor issued the request after two faculty members complained about hearing students conversing “very loudly” in Chinese in common areas like student lounges and study areas. In the email, she went so far as to suggest students’ career opportunities may be limited if they don’t practice English fluency. In response to the incident, medical school Dean Mary Klotman asked Neely to step down and issued a formal apology to the students in the program. 
Such occurrences are unacceptable and can be damaging to all individuals involved, even to those not directly affected. Universities must be held accountable for maintaining safe and welcoming spaces for students of all backgrounds. 
That said, USC has provided ample events to give students the chance to express their cultural identities. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Week and the APASA Heritage Festival are just a few recent examples of how students can become involved. Through these events, students can express their own cultural identities and reflect on their ethnic backgrounds by partaking in various activities.
The challenge that arises from inclusion events like these is the lack of impact it has on the broader community — the majority of people not associated with these cultures tend not to attend or show interest. This furthers cultural misconceptions and can lead to disparities among groups. Under these circumstances, increasing efforts to develop cultural awareness is essential. To improve upon this, Asian Pacific American Student Services Director Jonathan Wang said campus leaders need to be active role models to encourage others to participate in and engage beyond such activities.
“That’s something I hope to see more of — our leaders beyond a week, beyond a festival or some kind of easy food event, to take the step and to move into a space that can make them feel uncomfortable but, in that uncomfortableness, really be able to experience and learn what it is like for a person who doesn’t look like you or doesn’t share many of the identities that you do,” Wang said.
Although it takes extensive effort to bridge divides between cultures, it is important to note that minority groups should not feel persistent pressure to make their voices and values heard — rather, they should be accepted for who they are by the greater community. Building on this, Wang said he hopes it’s not just the responsibility of marginalized and minority identities to accommodate others.
“We lose a part of ourselves when we are asked to assimilate into different aspects of the majority culture. We do it sometimes willingly. Sometimes we fight because we want to retain that part of our culture — it’s a value to us,” Wang said. “And in that, how others are learning about who we are and not rejecting those aspects of what we are trying to keep — sharing in those experiences is a helpful opportunity.”
Above all, faculty and administration must be aware of the cultural identities their students hold. By keeping up to date on issues facing ethnic groups or reaching out to see how students’ needs can be better met, faculty can ensure that what happened at Duke will never happen on USC’s campus.
“Faculty members [need] to really understand who their students are and celebrate the differences, celebrate the diversity … to allow for a difference of experiences of languages, backgrounds, histories, upbringings and cultures to be strengthened in overall conversation because that’s where we do our true learning,” Wang said.
While the USC community has made valiant efforts in diversity and inclusion, communication errors can still occur. If we constantly enforce the notion that it’s acceptable for others to avoid minority cultural events, our hidden disconnect will only continue to expand.

She’s a force to be reckoned with on social media platforms, behind the microphone and among the people. Armed with dry wit, she corrects her often-misinformed, conservative antagonists, shares her vision with artful brevity and keeps young Americans engaged with tangible ideas set in an achievable framework. Every young socialist is smitten with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but now that she and Sen. Ed Markey have brought the Green New Deal to the table, aspiring and current urban planners are at an impasse. 
Many of the values Ocasio-Cortez represents align with those of city planners, but, as with most infrastructural undertakings, the feasibility of the Green New Deal within its projected timeframe is unreasonably low. Nevertheless, the root is always the best place to start correcting a problem, and with issues as pressing as environmental deterioration and climate change, infrastructure is the most sensible first step. 
At first glance, the resolution lays out its goals logically and systematically. It defines the current state of affairs, both socially and environmentally, proposes possible solutions and concludes with specific plans. But it overlooks very practical counterarguments that critics and confused supporters are dissecting and debating on Twitter, discussion boards and in urban planning Facebook pages.
A large portion of the Green New Deal involves reshaping buildings and transportation to increase their efficiency and reduce emissions. It overlooks more centrally environmentalist concerns like deforestation but tries to target environmental concerns that directly affect people’s daily lives, regardless of where they live. In the section regarding transportation, the resolution aims for “zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail.” 
Net zero emissions is impossible even with current technologies. Manufacturing of any kind requires electricity, and there is not enough sustainable energy created by solar, wind and water to replace every gas-guzzling car on the street with a sustainable electric vehicle. 
City dwellers constantly combat the rising costs of public transit. High-speed rail as an alternative for air travel is far from a viable reality. California has proved that building a rail network is regionally possible, but there is quite a bit of work to do before the idea for a cross-oceanic rail to replace long-distance air travel becomes a reality. 
These three goals need heavy research, calculation, funding and planning to even make it to a legislative floor, and in this resolution, they fail to provide specific expansion on the resolution’s more general goals.
The resolution also fails to speak in layman’s terms, as Ocasio-Cortez does so masterfully. It does not acknowledge consumer-level automobiles as the “transportation” that needs to be eliminated. As a result, the resolution fails to recognize that most infrastructure development is automobile-oriented. 
It’s not enough to build more railways. The country needs to re-lay its city grid, its housing development, its power and water systems. Insufficient budgeting always leads to an inability for federally led changes, but the funding required to reimagine every aspect of our construction would be in the trillions, close to the ballpark of the U.S. foreign debt.
Beyond poor precision of language and feasible goals, this resolution ultimately lacks a realistic acknowledgement of the time it will take to implement these initiatives. Ten years is not nearly long enough to accomplish even one of the 15 closing goals of the resolution. 
Despite its shortcomings, this resolution sets the right tone for U.S. environmental policy, especially with the 2020 presidential election on the horizon and fresh voices from the last midterms calling for change. Rather than leaning in on the resolution’s flaws, urbanists should focus on ways to bring its changes to fruition and to innovate and adapt to time frames. 
But most importantly, we must remember the purpose of the Green New Deal. This is a non-binding resolution. It’s not a bill, and it’s not a law. It’s merely a request for the U.S. to recommit to the values of protecting the planet and the people who live on it. And this is the attitude we need as stewards of a dying planet, whose resources we are slowly draining.

A team of USC researchers won second place at a January pitch event for a voice-assisted, choose-your-own-adventure speech therapy game they developed for children with cerebral palsy. The event was hosted by the Consortium for Technology Innovation in Pediatrics, a pediatric advancement program funded by the FDA and led by Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.
The game, called “Amplify,” was created by Christopher Laine, an assistant professor of research at the Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy, and Brian Cohn, a doctoral student in the computer science program. Laine and Cohn said they created the game after realizing there was a  lack of cost-effective and accessible speech therapy in America.
“Cerebral palsy is the most common movement disorder in children, and nearly half of them need some form of speech therapy,” Laine said. “The problem is that not all of them get the amounts and types of therapies they need under the current system.” 
Cerebral palsy is a neurological disorder that affects movement, motor skills and muscle tone as a result of brain damage, usually from birth. Cohn and Laine said the disorder sometimes results in speech and communication challenges, especially for children. 
“For some people with cerebral palsy, [who] have a lot of troubles even to form words, end up creating a language with their parents,” Cohn said. “So they can still communicate with their parents, but with other people it’s very hard.” 
Cohn said “Amplify” lets kids create their own story by choosing different plot points and directions through speech. 
“We created a system that can deliver speech therapy through an interactive, choose-your-own-adventure audio game,” Laine said. 
CTIP Director Juan Espinoza said “Amplify” was a unique tool for children diagnosed with cerebral palsy. 
“This voice-assisted technology … combined with [artificial intelligence] to help children get speech therapy at home or at school or anywhere is a huge benefit,” Espinoza said. “Many patients have difficulty [staying at a hospital] because of financial reasons … or [scheduling] conflict.” 
Laine and Cohn said children can navigate different plots in the choose-your-own-adventure story through speech exercises. Then, the exercises will be recorded so speech therapists can analyze them through “amplify.” Cohn and Laine said they believe voice-assisted therapy, as a supplement to doctor-advised therapy, offers an interactive experience for patients to simultaneously improve their communication and have fun at the same time. 
Cohn and Laine said they wanted to create a product to help families and individuals who lack access to hospital-led therapy due to economic or location barriers. 
“It’s very hard for some of [the] patients to even make appointments because sometimes they don’t have the gas that [they] need to drive to the hospital,” Cohn said. “In most developed countries … [patients] often do receive speech therapy …  what doesn’t exist is a solution for people who are more economically disadvantaged or disenfranchised.” 
While current forms of speech therapy involve methods that help patients control and monitor breath, pitch and volume more suitable for adults, Laine said therapy should be adaptable to children’s needs.
“We wanted to find a way that motivates them to practice the exercises they need to do … because any [form of] physical therapy is about repetition and practice,” Laine said. “[Motivating a] child to practice something that is apparently … boring is why we wanted to make this a game, some kind of fun immersive experience for them.” 
Cohn said “Amplify” will start with hospital-based therapy through trials with CHLA. 
In the future, the team wants to make the game more consumer-directed, which will allow a patient without health insurance to still be able to purchase the game on their phone or laptop. 
“What I imagine this will turn into is a phone host of speech therapy exercise that’s all completely usable offline without internet connection,” Cohn said. 
Cohn and Laine also hope to create a Netflix-style library of speech therapy exercises for “Amplify.” For instance, if a patient has problems articulating the letter “R,” he or she can access specific exercises to learn that letter, they said.

A small group of students at the Leventhal School of Accounting has reestablished the USC chapter of the National Association of Black Accountants to promote representation for accounting students of color. The organization was officially recognized by the University this semester after disbanding due to lack of leadership, organization and interest in 2014. 
NABA president Paul Adams II, a junior majoring in accounting and computer science, said that even though undergraduates serve on the executive board, the organization was originally restarted by a group of graduate students. 
“Originally [NABA] was brought back by grad students, however according to USC rules grad students could not be on the e-board, so the undergraduates got to start it,” Adams said. 
Elsie Wesamba, NABA’s vice president, said she was inspired to join the organization after speaking to her academic adviser. 
“My adviser recommended that I help restart the organization, and I decided that this is what I wanted to put all my time in,” said Wesamba, a freshman majoring in accounting. “I love the idea of the community and how it connects to something that I’m interested in.” 
Wesamba said she was interested in becoming involved when she arrived at USC and is excited that NABA has relaunched as an official organization under the Marshall School of Business this semester.
“I was looking for something to take initiative at USC, and it’s not that I wanted to start my own organization, but I wanted to be a part of something I really cared about and could put all my time into,” Wesamba said.   
According to Marshall’s school profile, black students comprise 3 percent of the school’s undergraduate population, and NABA is a way to connect members of the black community. 
“Because I’m a part of NABA, I get to meet so many people who are the same as me and from minority backgrounds,” Wesamba said. 
Firdaws Hagosm, NABA’s treasurer, believes that the organization has the ability to encourage underrepresented Marshall and Leventhal students to pursue their professional goals. 
“I joined NABA because I wanted to be apart of a community that not only uplifted me in my future career but would also help other students excel in their careers,” Hagos, a junior majoring in accounting, said. “NABA’s goal is to reduce the gap of minorities in accounting or related fields. It provides minorities access to many scholarships and networking opportunities in order to bridge the gap visible in the accounting profession.” 
According to the national organization’s website, less than 9 percent of accountants are black, a statistic NABA hopes to change. 
“[The] main goal is to bridge the opportunity gap between black professionals,” said Emmy Esquerre, NABA’s public relations chair. “[NABA] offers networking opportunities, scholarships and they hold national conventions.”
Esquerre, a freshman majoring in business administration, said that NABA hopes to establish ties with the local community by engaging in outreach with nearby schools. 
“We’re hopefully going to do some volunteering and high school programs to get other students that are younger than us interested in [NABA] because we really need more diverse perspectives in this field,” Esquerre said.  
Though the USC chapter is still in its beginning stages of development, Wesamba remains optimistic for the future and said the board is planning to make an impact in Leventhal. 
“Our goal is to get it started again,” Wesamba said. “Like have it be an organization that has members and events … because we are still in our very early stages.”   
Adams said the organization is hosting a major event panel on campus Feb. 21 with all four U.S.-based major accounting firms to encourage students of color in the field. 
“The black community at USC here is just so small, and I feel like because it’s so small, we have a really hard time interacting with each other and getting together,” Wesamba said. “It’s really important that we have spaces where we can discuss what it means to be a minority in a predominately white field.” 
This story is part of the Daily Trojan’s special coverage for Black History Month. It will run periodically throughout February.
