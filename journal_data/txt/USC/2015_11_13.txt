There are countless songs that every millennial knows the lyrics to word for word: “A Thousand Miles,” “Ignition (Remix)” and, of course, the “SpongeBob SquarePants Theme Song.” In fact, before many of us even knew how to talk, we were able to recognize the theme song to our favorite TV shows. The opening notes to these theme songs instantly flood us with feelings of nostalgia, and all the memories we have of those shows. Here are a couple of shows with some memorable themes that we watched when we were kids:
1. Johnny Bravo: “Man I’m pretty.” This guy had G.T.L. down before it came to the Jersey Shore. I still have yet to see someone hit the monkey dance as smoothly as he did in the opening titles.

2. Courage the Cowardly Dog: “But creeeeepy stuff happens in the middle of nowhere …” This simple-sounding theme song is in no way a reflection of how scary this show was. I still get shivers during the episode where Eustace steals a tablet and is visited by the ghost of King Ramses. “Return the slaaaaaab.” Shivers, every time.

3. The Powerpuff Girls: “SUGAR. SPICE. AND EVERYTHING NICE.” Fun fact, the guy who was the announcer for this show also voiced SpongeBob. Also, can someone please tell me how they were able to hold stuff without any fingers?

4. Dexter’s Laboratory: The intro to this show was beautifully done: an opera-like epic that summed up everything the show was about in 30 seconds. Everyone who had an annoying older sister watched this show like it was their last. And for everyone who didn’t love this show, how can you not love a show about a kid who’s smarter than Einstein but still has to deal with the everyday struggles of being a kid?

5. The Fairly Oddparents: “Obtuse, rubber goose, green moose, gauve juice, giant snake, birthday cake, large fries chocolate shake!” Drop the mic. I think I actually wished for fairy godparents one year for Christmas. Obviously, that didn’t happen.

6. Hey Arnold!: “Move it football-head!” This show was fantastic because it was able to present a lot of complex and deep issues that kids could learn from. Helga suffers from neglect in a broken marriage, Arnold never knew his real parents and his grandparents had to step in and the Stoop Kid was afraid to leave his stoop because that’s where he was abandoned as a kid. Deep enough for you? It’s okay, the lighthearted and jazzy theme song made up for it. Come to think of it, all of the music in this show was just fantastic.

7. Rocket Power: Did anyone actually know what they were saying in the theme song? I’m still lost. Anyway, this show brought out the inner X-Games in all of us. They also gave birth to one of the greatest handshakes in history: “woogity-woogity-woogity.”

8. Kim Possible: “So what’s the sitch?” There was always a new sitch (short for “situation” if you never figured that out) for the perfect Kim Possible. Who didn’t want to save the world every night while keeping straight-A’s and essentially be the greatest human being to ever exist? I’m one hundred percent sure I would have no idea what a naked mole rat is if I didn’t watch this show.

It’s likely that your favorite show wasn’t mentioned, but it’s also likely that you came close to crying when you remembered the shows that were on this list. Hopefully this list will give you the inspiration to go on a trip down memory lane that reminds you that you’ll always be a kid at heart.

The Trojans (7-3, 5-2) overcame a 17-6 halftime deficit to defeat the Colorado Buffaloes 27-24. Redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler went 17-27 with 204 yards and three touchdowns, while Justin Davis chipped in 85 yards on 14 rushes, as the Trojans rallied for the second consecutive week.
USC looked impressive on its opening drive, marching down the field behind some big runs by Davis. The Trojans had the ball inside the five with first and goal, but were stuffed by the Colorado defense. Alex Wood converted the field goal to give the Trojans an early 3-0 lead.
Colorado responded with a touchdown of their own two drives later and then capitalized off of Kessler’s sixth pick of the season with another touchdown. The Buffs would tack on a field goal to extend their lead to 17-3.
The Trojans had no answer for the Buffs’ passing game as Sefo Liufau and Cade Apsay shredded the Trojan secondary. Apsay stepped in after Liufau went down with an injury late in the first half.
The Trojans answered with a 10 play, three-minute drive that resulted in a field goal to end the half down 17-6. The Trojans managed just 165 yards of total offense in the first half with aerial threat JuJu Smith-Schuster being limited to just one catch for 19 yards.
The Trojans came alive after the intermission, scoring 21 unanswered points.
After holding off the Buffs on their first drive of the half, the Trojans marched down the field, behind the stellar work of both Davis and Ronald Jones II, for their first touchdown of the game.
The Buffs’ very next play resulted in a fumble, forced by Delvon Smith and recovered by Antwaun Woods. The Trojans drove the ball down the field but Kessler was sacked on third and goal. Fortunately, the Trojans were bailed out by an offside call. Kessler took advantage, finding De’Quan Hampton for a four-yard touchdown.
Colorado drove down the field following two straight Trojan scores. The Trojan defense came up huge and held the Buffs to a field goal attempt. Sophomore do-it-all Adoree’ Jackson came up with a major block on the field goal try and returned the ball into Buffalo territory.
The Trojans struck immediately after the blocked field goal as Kessler found a streaking Smith-Schuster for his third touchdown pass of the night to put USC up 27-17.
The Buffs wouldn’t go down without a fight, however. After a big punt return and late hit penalty against the Trojans, Apsay found George Frazier for a one-yard touchdown to bring the Buffs within a field goal, 27-24.
Colorado got the ball back again with 4:33 left in the game, but the Trojan defense held on. After giving up a first down via a pass interference call, the Trojan defense held the Buffs on fourth and five to take over the ball with under two minutes left.
Apsay finished 18-23 for 128 yards and two touchdowns. Donovan Lee led the Buffs in rushing with 32 yards on seven carries.
The Trojans had six sacks, their second consecutive game with six. Under Helton’s tenure, the Trojans have 19 sacks, compared to just 10 under Sarkisian.
The win is the Trojans fourth in a row. Next up is a visit to Eugene to face the Oregon Ducks.

Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The women’s soccer team is on to the next one.
The Trojans defeated Cal State Fullerton on penalties after a 3-3 draw in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. It was a thriller of a contest at McAlister Field as entertaining as it was tense.
Fullerton took the lead at 19 minutes on a lovely far-post header off of a long throw in. The Titans then doubled their lead with 11 minutes remaining in the half off of another header, this time from a corner kick.
The Women of Troy were in unfamiliar territory at the interval, trailing 2-0 and looking a bit out of sorts. However, the second half turned out to be an entirely different story.
“Offensively I thought we were doing a great job,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said of his team’s first-half performance. “And so the message was kind of to continue to be aggressive and be assertive going forward.”
Just minutes into the second half, center midfielder Morgan Andrews cut the visitors’ lead in half when she hit an absolute rip from outside the area. Unfortunately for the Titans, she was just getting started.
Andrews brought USC level in the 54th minute, finishing a cross by right-back Kayla Mills.
But, Fullerton quickly responded, regaining the lead immediately after Andrews’ equalizer. The ball bounced into the box and took a hop over the head of Trojan netminder Sammy Jo Prudhomme.
USC continued to dominate possession even after falling behind 3-2, never looking flustered despite what the scoreboard said. Then the hat trick came for No. 3 in red. Mills once again fed Andrews, who steered the ball past goalkeeper Jennifer Stuart and into the bottom corner.
It was 3-3 for the remaining 23 minutes of regulation, meaning overtime was on the way. Neither team was able to find the back of the net in overtime, though, and so the match had to be decided by a penalty shootout.
Prudhomme stopped two of Fullerton’s spot kicks, helping the team to victory with a pair of massive saves. Each Trojan penalty-taker did her job, as USC went four for four from 12 yards out in the shootout.
One of Prudhomme’s stops came on the first kick of the shootout.
“I think making a save on the first one was really important for the team cause I think it just calmed everybody down,” she said.
Despite only winning on a penalty shootout, USC certainly had the better of the play against Fullerton. The Women of Troy logged 33 shots and nine corners and, in the first half alone, hit two posts and a crossbar. The Titans made the most of their few opportunities and played with tremendous fight, but USC could have run away with the game.
The Women of Troy kept fighting, even when the ball refused to go in. They matched Fullerton’s pace up top and had the lion’s share of possession in the middle of the park. Mandy Freeman’s physical presence at center defensive mid ensured that Fullerton did not have long spells of possession, while workhorse Nicole Molen played a sound game and was battling all over the pitch.
Though Andrews was the hero with her three goals, center-backs Ally Prisock and Dominique Randle were also outstanding in this game. Randle and Prisock have noticeable chemistry and came up with a number of last-ditch challenges to win the ball back when Fullerton came with offensive pressure.
After allowing two goals in the first half, USC managed to take the game by the scruff of the neck rather than losing its flare. This team’s ability to bounce back is admirable, and much of the credit goes to McAlpine.
“Their character showed through,” McAlpine said of his team’s performance. “They could have given up and quit in the first half, but they stayed with it.”
The team exploded after the break and put Fullerton under a great deal of pressure.
“They got after it,” McAlpine said. “And it was absolutely fantastic the way they finished the game.”
The team’s camaraderie helped them to an emotional win over Fullerton. Andrews has lauded her team’s spirit this season and knows the group has something special.
“I’ve worked really hard this entire season,” Andrews said. “I’m doing what I have to do for the team, and they’re doing the same thing for me. So as long as we’re working hard together, we’re going to keep winning.”
The Women of Troy fell to Pepperdine in the first round of the NCAA Tournament last season. Ironically enough, USC lost that game on PKs. This is a different team, though, one that looks more than capable of contending for the national title this season.
USC now prepares to take on either Boston College or Princeton in the Round of 32.

The sign above blogger Palak Patel’s bed reads, “Stay Healthy.” Palak Patel | Daily Trojan
“Stay Healthy” 
These words are printed in my own messy handwriting, and hung above my bed. But after weeks filled with too many midterms and too much coffee, I’m often tempted to ignore it. I’ve made it a point to devote anywhere from a few minutes to an hour each day to maintaining my physical and mental health. Here are some of my favorite ways to keep myself performing and feeling my best.
Blogilates
Blogilates is a YouTube channel run by the ever-enthusiastic and inspirational Cassey Ho. Her workout videos are short, often less than ten minutes, and allow you to choose a workout that targets a specific area. I’ve found that one of the best ways to start my morning is with a short workout, and Blogilates lets me do that and still be on time to my 9 a.m class
Visit the USC Farmers Market
Every Wednesday, USC hosts a farmers market in McCarthy Quad. If you have an hour between classes, I recommend dropping by to both grab a bite to eat, and do some grocery shopping for the week ahead. The vendors sell everything from organic honey to dragonfruit, and picking out your fruits and vegetables is a great way to get yourself excited about eating well. 
Keep a journal
Most people associate journals with elementary-school crushes and middle-school drama. However, spending just a few minutes before bed putting pen to paper can help release pent up emotions. It can also put things into perspective, and you’ll be surprised at the number of positive things you can pick out, even on a terrible day.
Tune it out
Listening to music is one of the best ways to mentally decompress. I recommend creating a playlist of some of your favorite songs, and listening to them in the 20 minutes before you go to bed. By putting all your work away and focusing on your music while you get ready to fall asleep, your brain is cued in to the fact that it is time to unwind and relax.
Dress the part
Studies have shown that people who spend a few extra minutes on their appearance in the morning report higher levels of satisfaction with their lives. So take the time to put on whatever it is that makes you feel good about yourself, whether that be a killer pair of boots or some winged eyeliner, before heading off to class. You deserve it.
Being healthy involves more than just taking your vitamins, and these tips are some of my favorite ways to keep myself well both mentally and physically. Try them out, you’ll be surprised at the difference they make.

The weather is finally getting colder, and the days are getting shorter. You know what that means? We’re finally getting to the best part of the college football season. Teams are jostling for conference supremacy and a shot at the playoffs. Last week did not disappoint with quite a few high-profile matchups, and this week is no different. We might have an away game this weekend but grab your popcorn and bacon-wrapped hotdogs: It’s football prediction time.
No. 12 Oklahoma at No. 6 Baylor (Spread: -17.5)
At this point in the season, all of the Big 12 matchups for both Baylor and Oklahoma are win or go home. Oklahoma faces No. 6 Baylor, No. 15 TCU and No. 8 Oklahoma State. Meanwhile, Baylor faces No. 12 Oklahoma, No. 8 Oklahoma State, and No. 15 TCU. Both teams definitely have unenviable schedules to close out the season.
Despite their tough remaining games, fans should be comforted by Oklahoma’s impressive recent offensive performance. The Sooners have produced more than 300 passing and rushing yards in each of their last few games.
But, in case you haven’t been following along, having an impressive offense is practically a requirement for Big 12 teams. Last weekend, Baylor freshman quarterback Jarrett Stidham had a solid outing with three touchdowns and 419 yards against Kansas State. All in all, things are looking pretty good for Baylor. Baylor is 8-0 hosting ranked teams in the last three years and has blown out Oklahoma in the past two previous meetings. When you add the fact that Baylor is excellent at home — outscoring most teams by more than 20 points per game this season, it makes sense that ESPN and our model have Baylor as the winner this weekend.
No. 2 Alabama @ No. 17 Mississippi State (Spread: 15.5)
Oh boy, Alabama better get ready for the Mississippi State cowbells. While the fear of getting a cowbell-induced headache is very real for Alabama, Mississippi State has played a relatively easy schedule. Alabama showed its defensive dominance last weekend, holding Heisman front-runner, LSU running back Leonard Fournette, to just 31 yards on 19 carries.  At this point, Alabama controls its destiny in the SEC after Ole Miss’s loss to Arkansas (The 4th and 25 miracle). For Mississippi State to have a chance at upsetting the Tide, the Bulldog’s quarterback Dak Prescott, who’s responsible for 2,351 yards and 18 touchdowns this season, needs to tear apart Alabama’s secondary.
Our model agrees with ESPN that Alabama is the favorite in this one. But even after their statement win last weekend against LSU, Alabama will need to bring that same stone-wall defense this weekend.
No. 21 Memphis vs No. 24 Houston (Spread: -17.5)
While this ACC showdown has lost a little of its shine with Memphis’ loss to Navy last weekend, this matchup is still going to a be shootout worth watching. This season, Memphis has been excellent through the air — Paxton Lynch has more than 3,000 passing yards, 19 touchdowns and only two interceptions. On the other hand, Houston is more balanced with more than 250 passing and rushing yards per game.
Houston fans should take solace in the fact that it has a better defense, especially versus the run. Houston has allowed less than 100 rushing yards per game and has allowed 10 less points per game compared to Memphis. So if Houston can disrupt Memphis’ pass-heavy offense, they should have a shot at pulling off the upset. While Memphis is the higher ranked team, both our model and ESPN have Houston as the favorite for this matchup.
USC at Colorado (Spread: 17)
Once again, USC is a big favorite to win, but as we’ve seen, that really doesn’t mean much. Last weekend, our offense was running on all cylinders and wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster had yet another monster game with eight receptions for 138 yards. The key for USC this weekend is consistency.
Meanwhile, Colorado has a productive offense that has amassed more than 400 offensive yards per game. But Colorado’s defense has also been allowing more than 400 yards per game, hence their less-than-ideal record. Considering the Buffaloes joined the Pac-12 in 2011, they have been improving year over year, which is a difficult feat in a tough conference like the Pac-12.
Short of a major offensive breakdown, this matchup looks like it will be an easy win for the Trojans.

We are witnessing the rise of a new phenomenon:  the “campus crybully”.
Campus crybullies are crybabies that have learned to weaponize their status as victim, a coveted label by the Left.   They have two calling cards, race and gender.
Race came first. In 2001 Harvard president Larry Summers suggested that Cornel West— an African American Studies professor — get serious after West produced a rap CD called “Sketches of My Culture.” Summers also asked West fight a then-growing grade inflation scandal at Harvard, where one of every two grades was an A or A-.
Chaos erupted. Black professors at Harvard threatened to leave— Mr. West moved to Princeton. The leftwing editorial board of the New York Times criticized Mr. Summers, who quickly recanted, calling it all “a terrible misunderstanding.”
Then came gender. In 2005 Mr. Summers spoke at MIT about diversity. He speculated on why there aren’t more women scientists at elite universities. He touched on several possibilities: Maybe there were “patterns of discrimination” at work.. Maybe women preferred family over career. Or maybe, just possibly, it had something to do with “different availability of aptitude.”
Women professors blew a fuse. “I felt I was going to be sick,” wailed Nancy Hopkins, a biology professor at MIT, who left. “My heart was pounding and my breath was shallow, low,” Ms. Hopkins said. “I was extremely upset.”
Once again, Summers recanted. He published an open letter. “I deeply regret the impact of my comments,” he wrote, “and apologize for not having weighed them more carefully.” It was too late. By May 2005 his faculty had returned a vote of no confidence 218 to 185, with 18 abstentions. By February 2006 he was forced to resign.
These two incidents,having happened at Harvard, marked a turning point. The pleasures of aggression now were added to the comforts of feeling aggrieved, or victimized.
The toxic fruits of this development are on view not only at Yale and Mizzou, but throughout the higher-educational establishment, where spurious charges of “systemic racism,” “a culture of rape” and sundry other imaginary torts compete for the budget of pity and special treatment.
Amherst College is currently exploding with nonnegotiable demands from a student group that the president apologize for white supremacy, colonialism, anti-black racism, anti-Latin racism, anti-Native American racism, anti-Native/ indigenous racism, anti-Asian racism, anti-Middle Eastern racism, heterosexism, cis-sexism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, ableism, mental health stigma, and classism.” Really, you can’t make it up.
Weak, liberal university presidents are capitulating. Yale’s president told “student crybullies” who complained that they did not feel “safe” at Yale that “we failed you.” Yale College dean found himself “surrounded by a sea of upturned faces and fighting back tears” so he apologized for the administration’s silence on allegations of racial discrimination.
When the brilliant conservative lawyer Amy Wax spoke at the Yale Political Union last week, a group of students stood up, turned their backs on her, and raised their fists in the air in protest. “Several students,” the Yale Daily News reported, “cried during her speech.”
A few days later, Dean Holloway and other university administrators met with about 100 students at his home and sacrificed his self-respect to serve the progressive “crybully” culture. “I have disappointed you and I’m really sorry,” he said.
The confrontation “just broke my heart,” Mr. Christakis added. “I care so much about the same issues you care about. I’ve spent my life taking care of these issues of injustice, of poverty, of racism. I have the same beliefs that you do . . . I’m genuinely sorry, and to have disappointed you. I’ve disappointed myself.”
Groveling by progressive administrators to crybullies with far-fetched social justice claims is the “cool” response.
These episodes—embarrassing to any person of self-respect and many of which might be inspired by Maoist public-shaming events—underscores the surreal and silly quality of life at some American colleges now.
For the “campus crybully”, reality takes second place to progressive ideology.
The truth is that American universities are the safest and most coddled environments ever created by man. But “campus crybullies” have given up any hope of acquiring an education — they are often liberal arts majors who see no hiring once they graduate — so they focus on staying at college to push grievance and hoax racism, even manufacturing and growing slights into major race bigotry.
“Campus crybullies” are about timid moral self-indulgence.
There are encouraging signs. When a dean at Claremont College resigned on Thursday after “camopus crybukllies” accused the dean of racism because of a carelessly worded email, some brave students at the Claremont Independent published a dissenting editorial in which they berated hypersensitive students for bringing spurious charges of racism and the dean and the president for cowardice in not standing up to the barrage.
“Lastly,” they wrote, “we are disappointed in students like ourselves, who were scared into silence. We are not racist for having different opinions. We are not immoral because we don’t buy the flawed rhetoric of a spiteful movement.”
Courage is nearly non-existent on campuses today. Operating under the rubric of progressive saviors, these social justice warriors lack such courage. Open-minded students at Claremont provided a breath of fresh air. It will be interesting to see if it penetrates the fetid atmosphere that has settled over so much of American academic life.

Following protests on campus earlier in the day, student leaders and key authors of the campus climate resolution passed by the Undergraduate Student Government on Tuesday met with Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and Provost Michael Quick at an open forum Thursday evening in the United University Church.
“I’m the highest ranking academic officer at this University,” Quick said. “This is the most critical academic issue of our time. I’m accountable.”

Issues of race and discrimination are roiling college campuses across the nation. At noon, a rally was held on campus in solidarity with the students of the University of Missouri, which escalated when protesters moved to Bovard Auditorium, demanding that Quick come out and speak to students. Carry told those assembled that the provost would be available at 4:30 p.m. Later in the day, organizers of the rally announced that the forum would be held in the UUC.
Mykaila Williams, executive director of the Black Student Assembly, and Moira Turner, director of USG Diversity Affairs both gave statements at the beginning of the forum, with Turner’s directed to President C. L. Max Nikias and Quick.
In her statement, Williams noted the unrest at both Mizzou and other campuses and the role that student activists have played.

“The recent victories at the University of Missouri including the resignation of their president remind us all that we can make a difference and that we should continue striving to hold university leaders accountable when they are indifferent to the issues affecting their students,” she said.
Turner noted examples of racism at USC’s campuses, including an incident in May 2013 where LAPD officers in riot gear responded to a party held by black students, which she said the administration refused to acknowledge as racially motivated. She also cited an incident in February 2014 where a flier was mailed to the office of the Asian Pacific American Student Services, which she said the administration dismissed citing the diversity at USC.
“The events that are occurring at Mizzou are reflective of a larger issue present on college campuses nationally,” Turner said. “As students united we demand resources, not reports. We demand a culture of care, not of compliance. As students united we demand that you, President Nikias and Provost Quick, adopt the campus climate resolution and work with us to reach a strategic plan to achieve these goals listed in the resolution by the end of the year.”

Quick said that diversity was one of his foremost priorities as provost, noting that he hired three women of color to his office when he assumed the position in April.
“Diversity, inclusion, access and opportunity is one of the wicked problems of our time,” Quick said.
Quick said that he had read the resolution and that he was working with his team and the administration to formulate a University response that has action items around the issue, which he hoped would be released “very shortly.”
Carry said that one problem was communication between students and the administration. He said that numerous conversations have taken place regarding issues of diversity, but the administration has not done enough to communicate the work being done.
“We haven’t updated students, and that’s my bad,” Carry said.

Carry said he didn’t think any of the requests in the resolution were “unreasonable” and that he was committed to a continuing dialogue. Carry and Quick agreed to have biweekly meetings with the resolution authors to discuss its implementation.
The discussion then moved to specific provisions in the resolution, specifically the hiring of a vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion. Quick said there could be an issue with consolidating the responsibility entirely under one person and that the different schools should have some flexibility. Turner responded saying that the resolution includes the hiring of a vice dean for each of the schools and that having a single administrator responsible would increase accountability and the resources available to students.
Students also asked that specific administrators be appointed to deal with the provisions of the resolution. Carry and Quick said that they would be responsible for the whole resolution and that they would be happy to meet next week to assign specific administrators to address the various provisions.
The next provision discussed was the hiring of an additional Title IX investigator. Carry said that the Office of Equity and Diversity has 12 people working in it, with eight assigned to deal with faculty cases and four to student cases. Carry said that the allocation could change to six and six.
Shyann Murphy, executive director of the Women’s Student Assembly, said that USC has yet to name a Title IX Coordinator since the former coordinator, Jody Shipper left. Murphy said that in the interim, Kegan Allee has been both the Title IX coordinator and investigator, which has led to some cases taking six to eight months to resolve, rather than the federally suggested two months.

Carry said that the new Title IX coordinator would be responsible for making staffing changes. He said the search for Shipper’s replacement is ongoing, but that he is committed to reducing the wait time to 60 days. Carry said he hoped to have the position filled by the end of the semester.
Turner then mentioned the difficulty students had accessing high-level administrators. Quick said he made a concerted effort to make himself available.
“Within two hours of you asking for this meeting, I’m here,” he said.
Carry and Quick agreed to hold more open forums and to both hold office hours.
Carry also agreed that the University could do more to increase transparency with bias reports, including releasing a summary of the data at the end of each semester.
The conversation moved to the provision of the resolution regarding diversity in course curricula and diversity training for students and faculty. Quick said that students should meet with the Academic Senate because faculty are given a great deal of autonomy to decide their curriculum.

“We give a lot of freedom to faculty to design how they teach,” Quick said.
The final topic discussed was the issue of cultural resource centers being understaffed and under resourced. Students said that such centers should not be places where students merely receive information and paperwork, but also spaces for them to gather.
Carry said that he was looking into spaces in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center for cultural resource centers, most of which are currently in the Student Union.
Turner asked if Carry would commit to having space allocated in the new University Village. Carry said that he was open to continuing conversation, but since the Village would only be completed in Fall 2017, the campus center was the most viable space in the interim. Carry also said that he would be open to revisiting the repurposing of the Innovation Lab, currently in the Student Union, which was being considered as an expansion for the LGBT Resource Center.
Quick commended the students who organized the forum.

“What I’m so impressed with, is that students are passionate about this issue, as they should be, that they want to work with the administration, they want to work with faculty to figure this out,” Quick said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.  “It’s not just about making symbolic gestures, people are really ready to roll up their sleeves and work, as this University should, to figure these things out.”
Turner said that, overall, she thought the meeting went well but she hopes that the meeting will translate into tangible action from the University.
“I think it went OK, I think we can do better, but I am [optimistic], and I’m looking forward to our meeting on the 23rd,” she said.

I hate you, but I’m absolutely in love with you. Why are you one of the first things I think about when I wake up in the morning? Did I ever say that you could get inside my head and sweep my off my feet? You make my body feel so alive! Unfortunately though, I think we need to break up.
Nope, not talking about bae. It’s coffee.
After 18 years of living in a coffee-free world, I got addicted the start of my sophomore year. It might have had a little to do with being in college and the fact that you do a million things and get absolutely no sleep. I found myself constantly sleep deprived, only catching up on rare weekends when I was free or on break at home. Now, at the ripe age of 20, with the maturity of a junior, I feel like I know how to live my life (lol).
After far too many mornings of waking up and craving this brownish blackish beauty, I am slowly starting to cut ties.
Don’t get me wrong — coffee has a number of positive health benefits. It can wake your body up, keep you focused, aid in digestive health and give you loads of antioxidants. In my opinion, it’s also pretty tasty. But while these things are true, it’s also an extremely addictive stimulant that can cause negative health outcomes down the road. The caffeine in coffee can have several negative effects. According to Mayo Clinic, it triggers a host of problems, from insomnia and nervousness to stomach issues and rapid heartbeat. Not to mention, it dehydrates you like crazy.
There are many alternatives that can suffice and provide us with more health benefits as well as the much-needed boost of caffeine when we really need it.
When it really comes down to it, you don’t always need a food or beverage to give you that burst of energy. Try doing 20 jumping jacks right when you get out of bed, hop in a cold shower and turn up your tunes high. Drink a huge bottle of refreshing water. There are so many ways to get that natural energy boost that will get you through the morning and off to a great day.

The women’s soccer team will take on Cal State Fullerton in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Friday afternoon at McAlister Field.
The Women of Troy enjoyed a tremendous regular season, going 14-5-1 overall and 9-2 in the Pac-12. The team was rewarded for its efforts by being named the No. 4 seed in its quadrant of the bracket.
Cal State Fullerton is a strong side that won 16 of its 20 games this season in the competitive Big West Conference. The Titans come into the game as the clear underdogs, but USC expects to be ready and will certainly not underestimate its opposition.
The Women of Troy were ousted in the first round of the tourney last season, falling to Pepperdine on penalty kicks.
With that serving as motivation, along with the fact that this is the first ever women’s soccer postseason match at McAlister Field, head coach Keidane McAlpine and his team figure to be reasonably fired up.
USC is in the same quadrant of the bracket as Virginia, Rutgers and Notre Dame. If the Women of Troy take care of business against Cal State Fullerton, they will face the winner of the Boston College-Princeton match in the Round of 32.
