The USC Racing Team is completing its race car for the 2012 Formula Society of Automotive Engineers Western Conference Competition this June. The competition, held at the Lincoln Airpark in Lincoln, Neb., will involve more than 200 teams from around the world.

The racing team spends one year designing and building the car from the week after the competition until mid-April. Within the Racing Team, there are four primary sub-teams that focus on different aspects of the design and assembly process, said Tyler Makin, USC Racing Team public relations chair.
“We have the power train team, which works on the transmission and engine; the electronics team, which tunes the engine; the chassis team, which connects the frame and the body; and the aerodynamics team which determines the most aerodynamic way to build a body around the frame using full carbon fiber,” Makin said.
Each team submits one car to the competition in either the static or dynamic category.
“The static events are comprised of a design presentation, a business presentation and a cost analysis report about the car,” Makin said. “The dynamic events see the cars actually get on the road and race.”
This year the team is implementing a pneumatic system of changing gears, which utilizes air pressure and requires the driver to only push a button to change the gear, Makin said.
Elias Izpisua-Rodriguez, president of the USC Racing Team, said at this stage in the building process USC Racing is poised to deliver its best showing in the competition.
“We’ve all been putting in a ton of work and I’m pretty confident we’ll be in the top 20 or top 10, which is something USC has never done before,” Izpisua-Rodriguez said.
The USC Racing Team was founded in the 1980s and now has approximately 70 members on its roster, Makin said. The team works on the cars in the machine shop on the bottom floor of Parking Structure A.
The USC Racing team is open to students of all majors, although a majority of the club’s members are mechanical engineers.
“Being a part of the Racing Team definitely allows us to apply what we’ve learned in the classroom to the real world in very hands-on ways,” said Mike Kennedy, vice president of USC Racing. “Being a part of USC Racing has definitely been the most educational part of my experience at ’SC so far.”
Kennedy said that, in addition to the practical experience USC Racing Team provides, the team is also a tight-knit community.
“There’s a certain sense of camaraderie that comes from spending hours together in the shop and that’s probably my favorite part of the team,” Kennedy said.
Though the team does receive some funding from the Viterbi School of Engineering, most of the team’s budget comes from fundraising efforts.
“We contact potential sponsors and explain that they’ll get publicity and even possibly future engineers in return for support,” Izpisua-Rodriguez said. “Some of the larger companies give monetary donations, but many just give us different car parts that we can use.”
Assembly of the car is scheduled to be completed by mid-April. Approximately 12 team members will travel to Lincoln for the 2012 Formula SAE competition in June.

Monica Valencia, a junior majoring in sociology, has made USC history, by becoming the university’s first female veteran to win the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship.
Recognition · Monica Valencia, a junior majoring in sociology, is the first female veteran at USC to receive the Mellon May fellowship. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
The fellowship is a national award granted to identify, support and mentor highly qualified underrepresented undergraduate students interested in diversifying faculties in higher education. The objective is to support students’ pursuit of a doctorale.
USC’s MMUF program is a partnership between the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the Office of the Provost and the Division of Student Affairs.
Before attending USC, Valencia served in the armed forces as a military police officer to help support her family.
“[The military] was pretty much my only option,” Valencia said. “I grew up really poor and I needed to support my family.”
Valencia spent a total of six years in the armed forces — three in North Dakota, learning about nuclear defense, two in Germany and one in South Korea.
Valencia said her tour in South Korea was the toughest.
“We were always alert,” Valencia said. “We wore chemical warfare suits and participated in real war simulation.”
Valencia said being a woman in the military is difficult and required her to work harder than her male counterparts.
“It’s quite difficult,” Valencia said. “It’s a male-dominated entity, especially being a military cop. Being a military cop is five times harder than working in medical or the military administration. You have to do everything better just to keep up and be respected and considered for promotion.”
USC is a Yellow Ribbon school, meaning it covers Valencia’s entire tuition and fees associated with her education.
“Being at USC is such a humbling experience,” Valencia said. “I know it sounds cheesy, but there are no other words to describe it. Being at USC is a dream come true.”
MMUF selects around 3,700 undergraduate students annually from across the nation for the award. More than 90 percent of recipients receive baccalaureate or doctoral degrees.
As a recipient of the fellowship, Monica will have the opportunity to gain practical experience by working alongside members of the USC faculty.
“This is an incredible opportunity to be paired up with faculty, conduct your own research and prepare for grad school,” Valencia said. “I want to be a professor and add to diversity in academia, especially in faculty.”
Valencia said she wants to research indigenous migrants from Mexico, specifically the Oaxacan people, and how negative reception hurts their upward mobility in a modern context. She will begin her research this summer and be mentored by Jody Vallejo, a USC assistant professor and faculty research specialist in immigration.
“Over the summer, I’m excited to work with an indigenous group in Oxnard conducting interviews and surveys,” Valencia said.
Valencia said she is surprised to see how far she has come given the circumstances of her upbringing.
“My parents didn’t even finish high school,” Valencia said. “I’m not supposed to be where I am right now. I beat the odds.”
Thank you all so much for your support!! No of this would be possible without having such a wonderful support system. Mil gracias……
Hola Chica, Monica, very proud of you, to know you is a humble opportunity. So glad you got it, and the first for you La Chicana…..let me know when you have a break, we got to celebrate….
talk about affirmative action.
Monica, I’m so Proud of you . Putting your mark on USC Campus i can’t wait to see you make your mark on the World. I Wish you the best in school and everything else.
Im very proud of you on what you have accomplished. Like your mom says you are true Valencia lol. Women in our family’s work hard to be on top. As myself I am working on master program.. I wish you the best in your studies ;)

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department confirmed that a body found Thursday floating in the Dominguez Channel in Carson, Calif., is that of 23-year-old Elgin Stafford, a former USC graduate student who went missing from his home in Carson on March 20.
As of Sunday, the cause of death had not been determined. The Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office is waiting on lab results that could take six to eight weeks to process.
According to the Daily Breeze, Stafford’s body was spotted in the channel area between Avalon Boulevard and 213th Street in Carson.
Stafford enrolled in the graduate program for public diplomacy at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism in fall 2011 before withdrawing in January. He received his undergraduate degree from UC Berkeley.
The Sheriff’s Department said Stafford had exhibited erratic behavior before his disappearance.
Michael L. Jackson, vice president for student affairs, said the university expresses its condolences to Stafford’s friends and family.
“We are very sad to learn about the death of Elgin Stafford,” Jackson said. “He was an important member of the Trojan Family and our hearts and prayers go out to his family. Every student is very precious to us and has great potential. We are sorry that Elgin’s life journey has ended in such a tragic way. We will do our best to support his family, friends and the Annenberg school community during this difficult period.”

Undergraduate Student Government and The New York Times are teaming up to increase print readership at USC.
As part of The New York Times’ efforts to reach out to universities, it agreed to have a one-month trial of free newspapers on the University Park Campus starting Monday.
There will be 40 newspapers distributed in five racks across campus. The locations of the racks are still being finalized.
“Where you can walk around and pick up a Daily Trojan, you’ll be able to walk around and pick up a more national newspaper like The New York Times,” USG President Monish Tyagi said. “The idea there is you get your campus news and you have your student newspaper, but students also have access to a broader, more worldwide covering newspaper as well.”
The trial is meant to increase readership and gauge student interest in world news, Tyagi said.
“It’s important for students to be aware of what’s going on in the world,” Tyagi said. “This is one small way in order to help do that. I read the Daily Trojan every single day and there’s a little coverage of what’s going on throughout the world on a larger scale, but this way students will be informed not only about what’s going on on campus but also kind of a bigger picture of what’s going on outside.”
Ali Blair, a sophomore majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, said providing free newspapers to students will be beneficial considering rising subscription fees.
“I recently unsubscribed to the Los Angeles Times because it just costs too much, but as a journalism major, I would love to have access to a national newspaper through school,” Blair said. “It’s [the university’s] job to give us the best education, and access to news is a part of a good education,” Blair said.
If students show enthusiasm about the availability of The New York Times around campus, the program could be instituted permanently next year, USG Assistant Director of Academic Affairs Jason Wei said.
Wei said it would also need to secure additional funding to extend the program.
“If The New York Times is willing to work with us next semester on the cost and we’re able to find funds, then we’ll be able to continue the program,” Wei said. “If it gets the majority of the student population to really enjoy the program and put their support behind it, then the administration might be persuaded to fund it.”
Michelle Crisosto, a sophomore majoring in communication and art history, said she will take advantage of the free newspapers.
“There’s nothing that compares to a real newspaper,” Crisosto said. “I get the news online every day but still have a respect for traditional print, and if it was provided by the school, then I don’t see why I wouldn’t pick up a copy on my way home from class.”

On an emotional Senior Day, the USC women’s water polo squad soundly defeated California 10-7 in a match not as close as the final score would indicate.
Not that close · Despite the score, sophomore two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist and No. 3 USC’s victory over California was never really in doubt Saturday. - Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
The No. 3 Women of Troy (17-3, 4-1) used a flurry of three goals in 80 seconds midway through the second quarter to take a 5-2 lead, and never looked back against the No. 5 Bears (16-6, 3-2).
“Our plan is to always do the little things right,” USC assistant coach Casey Moon said.
“[You] keep your head on a swivel and focus on the fundamentals, and you’ll win out.”
Junior driver Dominique Sardo led the scoring for the Women of Troy with her second hat trick of the season, while sophomore two-meters Kaleigh Gilchrist and Colleen O’Donnell each contributed two goals to the scoring effort.
Both teams started slow, with the Women of Troy taking a 2-1 lead after junior two-meter Nicolina McCall nailed a lob shot in the upper left corner two seconds before the end of the first quarter. After Cal tied the score two minutes into the second quarter, USC’s offense changed gears and rolled off three straight goals, two by Sardo, and added another point on a long-distance skip shot by freshman driver Monica Vavic to take a 6-3 lead at halftime. Cal would not get any closer than this.
“We came together as a team, saw our open players and hit them perfectly,” senior captain and driver Nadia Dan said.
The team outscored Cal 3-1 in the third quarter, ending the quarter with a lob shot goal by Sardo to complete her hat trick, and took a 9-4 lead heading into the final quarter. In the fourth, O’Donnell hit a long shot to make the score 10-4.
Following this, Cal reeled off three straight goals, capped by utility Remington Price’s close-range strike with 12 seconds to go.
“We did a good job of playing defense in practice all week and it showed in the match, but we still need to focus on our transition defense and need to always be moving in the right direction,” Dan said.
Before the match, USC honored seniors Dan, utility Kara-Leigh Huse and goalie Morgan Vickers with bouquets and a ceremony for Senior Day. While this year’s class has only three seniors, they will leave behind a legacy of being crucial in developing team chemistry and changing the squad from just a team into a family.
“It’s bittersweet,” Dan said. “I can’t believe it’s over”.
The Women of Troy’s season, however, is not. The squad travels north next weekend to take on San Jose State and Stanford, and then will close out the regular season at home against Cal State Bakersfield on April 20.

Loyola Marymount proved to be no match for the Women of Troy, as the sand volleyball team defeated the Lions 5-0 at Annenberg’s Community Beach House on Saturday. The win improved USC’s record to 5-1, and dropped Marymount to 0-3.
It was the second time the Trojans defeated the Lions, as both teams met earlier this month in a momentous first match for both schools in USC’s brand-new NCAA sport. USC also took the win that day, winning every single match in a 5-0 sweep over the Lions.
In Saturday’s second matchup between the two teams, USC did not drop a single set during the morning’s team games and won all five matches in doubles play.
USC’s No. 4 team of senior Kendall Bateman and sophomore Sam Hirschmann took the first win with a 21-8, 21-10 score, and USC’s squad of freshman Kati Duddridge and graduate student Megan Thornberry quickly followed, defeating the Lions 21-7 and 21-11.
USC’s No. 1 team of sophomore Sarah Shaw and graduate student Geena Urango then defeated Marymount’s Litara Keil and Betsi Metter with scores of 21-12 and 22-20.
The afternoon’s pairs tournament saw Shaw and Urango defeat Bateman and Hirshmann in the quarterfinals with scores of 21-15, 21-17.
They went on to win their next two matches in the  semi-finals and finals, ultimately defeating USC sophomore Kirby Burnham and graduate student Kelly Irvin to claim the doubles championship of the day.
Loyola Marymount’s only victory of the match came in the pairs quarterfinals, with Marymount’s Keil and Metter beating USC’s Duddridge and Thornberry with scores of 21-19 and 22-20.
USC next visits Pepperdine on April 7, and will prepare to compete in the USA Volleyball Beach Collegiate Challenge in the coming weeks.

USC’s road trip to Washington and Oregon marked not only a successful start to conference play, but also to a notable milestone for the Trojans’ longtime head coach.
With two sweeps over No. 22 Washington (12-5, 0-2) on Friday and No. 59 Oregon (14-3, 0-2) on Saturday, the No. 1 Trojans (21-0, 2-0) gave USC coach Peter Smith his 200th victory in his 10-year tenure with the team, which has won 41 straight matches since last February.

“It’s a crazy journey,” Smith said. “It’s a wild place to coach because of all the expectations, and I look at that as a great challenge and I love it.”
Clinching USC’s win over the Ducks and Smith’s landmark was freshman Roberto Quiroz, who defeated Jose Izquierdo 6-4, 6-4 and notched his 10th straight singles win.
Before Quiroz’s clincher, the Trojans had a quick 3-0 advantage over Oregon following a sweep in doubles and two straight-set singles wins from No. 2 senior Steve Johnson and No. 23 sophomore Ray Sarmiento on courts 1 and 2, respectively.
On courts 3 through 6, the Ducks managed to stay close in the first sets, but every Trojan pulled away for straight-set wins except No. 53 sophomore Emilio Gomez, who ousted Daniel Sardu in three sets to finish the 7-0 sweep.
“You always want the best for your team, but I want close matches. I want us to be challenged,” Smith said.
Before their five-hour car ride to Eugene, Ore., the Trojans began conference play in Seattle with a 7-0 win against the Huskies on Friday.
After a 3-0 finish in doubles and two wins from No. 13 senior Daniel Nguyen and No. 38 Yannick Hanfmann, the Trojans earned their first Pac-12 victory with Gomez’s 6-0, 7-6 (3) win over Viktor Farkas.
With USC’s 20th win of the season in hand, Quiroz, Johnson and Hanfmann defeated their opponents to round out the sweep. In the marquee matchup between Johnson and No. 14 Kyle McMorrow, Johnson prevailed with a 6-3, 6-3 finish.
After the road trip, Smith had a chance to reminisce on his time with USC and share his belief that he will remain the Trojans’ coach for a long time to come.
“I’m very happy here. There’s nothing I really see out there. You never say ‘never,’ but this is my home,” Smith said. “I feel like I’m a Trojan, and this is where I want to be.”
Johnson, who has played under Smith as a key component of USC’s three consecutive NCAA titles, voiced his appreciation for his guidance throughout the years.
“It’s been an honor and a privilege to play for him. He’s been a big part of my life and my future,” Johnson said. “The guys are working hard and everyone is believing in him, and he’s been a great coach.”
With two conference wins in the book, the Trojans will travel to Salt Lake City to battle Utah (11-6, 0-1) on Friday, followed by a trip to Tucson to face the University of Arizona (5-11, 0-1) on Saturday.

Let’s get this out of the way: We’re going to see a playoff in college football.
Not this year or even next year, granted.
But at some point in the future — and it’s not all that far off — we’re going to see it.
Since January, Bowl Championship Series leaders have been discussing the potential of adopting a four-team playoff, similar to the plus-one model that has floated around for years.
And last week, following an all-day meeting Monday at a hotel near Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, the BCS released a statement declaring that their “talks have entered the ‘brass tacks’ level.”
“For every concept that enjoys broad support, there are a host of intricate details that we’re talking through,” it read.
The statement also posed a series of logistical questions. Hey, it’s the BCS after all.
“For example, if we change the current format, would we play some games on campus or all games on neutral sites? If some games are on campus, is that too much of a competitive advantage? If all games are at neutral sites, would fans be able to travel to two games in a row? How would teams be selected? By a committee, by the current ranking formula, or by a different formula? When exactly would games be scheduled, considering finals, holidays and our desire to avoid mid-January games?”
Either way, the concept of the current BCS structure is under review, and quite possibly, within the next five years or so, it’ll look slightly different.
We’re likely not going to see a full-fledged eight- or- 16-team style playoff — similar to the Football Championship Subdivision level. The odds of that are about as good as the Big East keeping its automatic bid. But a four-team seeded playoff system is gaining traction — a lot of traction.
For USC, and other college football titans, this is only a good thing.
In part, the shift toward a playoff carries populist sentiments. A structured four-team playoff would, in theory, allow for smaller schools such as Boise State, which come from a non-BCS conference, to play for a national title, by playing its way into the top four — a far more likely occurrence than landing as the No. 1 or No. 2 team in the final standings. Remember, no team from a                  non-BCS conference has ever played for a BCS national title.
So, yes, a playoff would in fact help the Broncos out, along with a litany of other schools from Conference USA, the Mid-American Conference and the Mountain West Conference, among others.
Perhaps, however, USC stands to gain more than anyone.
Generally, playoff systems reward teams that finish toward the upper echelon of the standings on a consistent, annual basis. In short, teams don’t have to finish undefeated with a No. 1 ranking. More than anything, they simply need to land in the top five, or the top 10. And statistically, no other program does that more frequently than USC.
Over the last 10 years, the Trojans have finished the season ranked in the top 10 of the Associated Press top-25 poll eight times — tied with Ohio State for the most among any program. The next closest are LSU, Oklahoma and Texas, which each have six finishes since 2002.
But not only is USC accustomed to finishing near the top of the rankings, it also plays some of its best football during the latter half of the year, suggesting that it might thrive in a four-team playoff, as well.
Since 2007, USC has gone 15-3 during the month of November, and last year, it went 4-0, including a three-point upset victory against Oregon in Autzen Stadium.
In 2008, it lost in late September at Oregon State, then reeled off 10 straight wins, including a two-touchdown win over Penn State in the Rose Bowl to finish 12-1. The year before, it stumbled twice in October before reeling off five consecutive victories to finish off the year with a Rose Bowl victory.
And in 2002, it finished with eight straight wins and a No. 4 ranking in the final AP poll. Think those teams might have liked the idea of a playoff?
We’re still a few years away from any significant changes to the college football postseason, granted. But nonetheless, as talks about a four-team playoff heat up, any changes toward a playoff unmistakably benefit ’SC.

Wasn’t this a campaign promise by Obama in 2008?
“The odds of that are about as good as the Big East keeping its automatic bid.”
huh?  Do you seriously think Conference USA, Mountain West or Conference USA/Mountain West merger is going to get an automatic bid instead?  Sure Big East is towards the bottom of the totem pole, but it’s far better than the other conferences.
Who cares, just get it done.  A lot of college football treams since the 20’s & 30’s base their reputation solely on National Championships that were given to them by a local newspaper deeming them so.  No two teams have benefited more from that than USC and Notre Dame.   Keep it simple, play the four teams at the higher ranked teams’ site, play the National Championship at a rotated bowl like it is– that part is not broken.  You don’t need 20 attorney’s to figure it out.
Let’s see, imminent means not this year or even next year?

The USC football team wrapped up its second scrimmage at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday. The scrimmage, which was open to the public, emphasized the immense competition occurring during spring practices.
As spring practices come to a close in two weeks, USC coach Lane Kiffin emphasized the need to continue individual skills development. “I don’t really think there is any real big thing but just continuing with individual development,” Kiffin said. “Guys like Tre Madden have come over with not a lot of experience there and continue to develop them in their roles.”

ω
Aside from major roster changes, like Madden switching to running back, much of the spring practice attention has been fixed on who will be the back-up quarterback. Following Saturday’s scrimmage, Kiffin stated that he would be confident playing either of the quarterbacks [Wittek and Kessler]. Yet Kiffin is not sure who will earn the number two position.
“I would be very comfortable with both of them. I think they are doing a great job,” Kiffin said. “Neither of them has gone beyond the other to know who the No. 2 is yet.”
ω
The quarterback competition for the coveted backup position has not phased redshirt freshman quarterback Max Wittek.
Wittek believes that the quarterback competition is necessary to prep for the future.
“If you go out there trying to compete to be the backup, that is not going to serve you well in the future when Matt is gone,” Wittek said. “You have to compete to be the starter every day.”
As emphasized by Kiffin, players are using spring ball as an opportunity to work on their individual skills before the season officially commences.
ω
Redshirt junior offensive tackle Kevin Graf has been switched to the right side during spring practices.
“Right now, I’m focusing on my game and getting better at it,” Graf said. “You can always get better at everything. Most specifically, I have been working on my run-and-pass game.”
Entering the 2012 season, Graf is asserting himself as a leader on and off the field.
“I am one of the older guys and one of the leaders now,” Graf said. “I’m trying to be vocal and I am trying to be that guy that is always there for everybody, hyping them up, if they ever need help giving it.”
ω
Though the scrimmage was open to the public, having family and fans in the Coliseum seats does not worry the USC Trojans.
“I don’t think it makes much of a difference at all,” Wittek said. “We come out here and practice whether it’s over at USC or here in the Coliseum. I think we take it as it is and the more people that come out, the better it is because we have to get used to playing in that environment.”
The Trojans have two weeks remaining in official spring practices before returning to the Coliseum for the spring game on April 14.

With the late-season Mountain Pacific Sports Federation race heating up, the USC men’s volleyball squad considers every match a must-win bout, especially against Stanford, who was looking for revenge after the Trojans swept the then-top-ranked Cardinal late February in Palo Alto, Calif.
Homecourt advantage · Junior outside hitter Steven Molchalski and the Trojans are undefeated at the North Gym this season. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Luckily, the Trojans went two- for-two this weekend by defeating Pacific and the Cardinal to cap their successful stint back in their old stomping grounds in the North Gym.
The No. 2 Trojans (18-4, 14-4) swept the No. 11 Tigers (7-16, 4-13) with a score of 25-18, 25-16, 25-22 Friday night, then swept the season series against the No. 5 Cardinal (15-6, 12-5) in a 25-22, 25-20, 15-25, 25-20 victory Saturday evening.
The team extended its winning streak to 13, passing last season’s mark of 12 in a row. They now have the longest Trojan winning streak since 1990-91, when the team won 30 in a row over two seasons.
Redshirt sophomore opposite hitter Tanner Jansen led the way with 17 kills against Stanford while having a .519 hitting percentage, while senior co-captain and outside hitter Tony Ciarelli added 12 kills and freshman middle blocker and national blocking leader Robert Feathers hit .889 while contributing a match-best seven blocks.
After pulling out close victories in the first two sets Saturday night, the Trojans lost their first set in five matches.
Stanford’s serving and passing overtook the Trojans in the third set, and the Cardinal trailed after giving up the first point of the set.
After that, the Trojans found a new energy in the fourth set and showed their ability to fight back after being knocked down. The Trojans started the final set slow, trailing 10-12.
From there, they hit their stride, rolling off six straight points in an 11-3 run that put them up 21-15, and didn’t look back.
“We saw the trees in the forest and not the forest in the trees,” said Ciarelli when asked about what changed in the final set after the Trojans dropped the third. “We didn’t dwell on the result of the game or the match, but focused our intensity and took every point as it came. This game was a testament to our will to come back.”
The consensus MVP of the game was Jansen, who seemed to be everywhere on the court and had timely kills and blocks for the Trojans down the stretch.
“Every time we needed a crucial play, T.J. was there,” coach Bill Ferguson said.
“He never gets rattled and was ultra-aggressive and hitting the ball exceptionally well.”
On Friday night, the Trojans went out and proved why they’re near the top of the conference standings and Pacific is not. After a failed chest bump in                   pre-game introductions by junior outside hitter Steven Mochalski, not much else went wrong for the Trojans. Ciarelli ended the first set with a brutal ace that knocked Pacific’s star player Taylor Hughes back a couple of feet, and the rout was on.
Mochalski led the way with 11 kills, while Jansen and senior     co-captain and middle blocker Steve Shandrick had 10 kills each with Shandrick hitting .533.
The Trojans’ defense was the star of the match though, holding the Tigers to .145 hitting and having 10 blocks to Pacific’s 8.5, defeating the Tigers at their strongest facet. The Trojans will return to the Galen Center this week after playing the last two weeks on their old court at North Gym.
After top-ranked UC Irvine was swept Saturday night against UCLA, the Trojans are positioned to take over the No. 1 national ranking.
This sets up for a clash between the top two teams in the nation Saturday night as Irvine comes to town after the Trojans host UC San Diego on Thursday at 7 p.m.
The Trojans did not sweep Stanford up there. The match went five sets. Your continued mis- information
has become annoying with other articles. How hard is it to get the facts correctly?

Every time a girl realizes she must attend another outing, another date or anything in between, the search for the perfect outfit is on.
And when it comes to dress hunting, the situation is even stickier. Oftentimes finding the perfect dress proves nearly impossible, but fashion figure Shareen Mitchell makes it easy.
The vintage curator, stylist and designer transformed a space near Chinatown into a shopper’s paradise. Shareen Vintage on Spring Street deserves a spot among Los Angeles’ truly hidden gems.
Nestled in an area surrounded mostly by residential houses or industrial buildings, the space takes advantage of its large warehouse-like locale to house hundreds of dresses. When shoppers search for the address, they might stumble upon a closed door with a sign directing them to the back, already creating an air of intrigue.
Naturally, mostly women will journey to the store, but even if men want to browse — or accompany their sweetheart — they cannot go inside. When you enter the store there is a sign blatantly stating no men allowed.
Though it might seem sexist, it’s because of the very relaxed atmosphere of the store, in which shoppers change near the racks — they find a dress and put it on right there. The store also provides many places to sit down when shoppers grow weary. Not to mention, if they burn too many calories walking through the large space, the shop also provides snacks.
The store’s two floors are divided into different sections. There are new arrivals, original Shareen designs, separates, dresses with some damage, mini-dresses, high-end dresses and more. One part of the store organizes the dresses into racks labeled with the time period their styles embody.
Upstairs shoppers can also browse through containers labeled with words such as styling, children, ethnic and home, revealing plenty of different materials and outfits.
For instance, one item in the “styling” container was a bumblebee-like outfit, a striped black and yellow top with a bright yellow tutu bottom. In fact, there are plenty of tutus to be found around the store in a wide range of colors.
Despite being a vintage store, there are plenty of clothes to satisfy even the most modern of tastes. In fact, Mitchell told The New York Times that she was not “interested in vintage for vintage’s sake.”
This updated vintage feel comes across in the store’s description of its content: “Vintage and eclectic clothing for the urban gypsy,” a statement that fits well with the clothing but also the overall image of the store.
At Shareen Vintage, you can find anything from rave clothing to prom dresses to theater costumes. And the customers vary in age, as the store is very welcoming and has clothing to fit any taste.
Besides eclectic clothing and couches, the store also has mirrors decorated with accessories like hats and gloves.
These, along with the hanging paper lanterns, give the impression that you’re walking into another world.
And if a shopper falls head-over-heels in love with the locale, the store is open to make bookings for birthday parties and other major events.
If you don’t want to trek to the store you can shop online or check Facebook for photographs of new arrivals.
The surrounding area doesn’t give any sense that inside a door there lies a huge collection of every dress, tutu, corset or separate imaginable.
You don’t need to travel to a mall or a well-known block of stores; Shareen welcomes shoppers to spend as much time browsing its impressive collection.
Driving is probably the best mode of transportation since no bus stops exactly in front of the store, but even if a shopper doesn’t walk away with her new favorite dress in hand, she can at least say she gave it a good try. And she might’ve walked out of her new favorite store.
 
Shareen Vintage is located on 1721 N. Spring St.

Greek mythology has three chief components: guys with mommy and daddy issues, guys with chips on their shoulders and guys who can’t resist a pretty face.
These standards have inspired some of the greatest works in literature but have also inspired a bunch of cheesy sword-and-sandal flicks. Wrath of the Titans, the sequel to the 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans (1981), falls into the latter.
Heroic tale · Though Wrath of the Titans is grandiose in theory, it fails to deliver enticing action sequences and is instead dull and lifeless. - Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
Ten years after the events of Clash of the Titans, Perseus (Sam Worthington) is a single dad trying to raise his son Helius (John Bell) to be a respectable fisherman; viewers are left to assume his canonical firstborn son, Perseus, died of colic or something. Meanwhile, the gods are losing their powers as humans cease their worship, which makes it difficult for them to contain the imprisoned Titan Kronos.
Considering that Zeus (Liam Neeson) and his brothers overthrew Kronos — their father — in the first place, this is cause for concern.
Alas, family rivalries make children of us all. Ares (Édgar Ramírez) whines that his father Zeus favors his bastard son Perseus, while Hades (Ralph Fiennes) hates ruling the Underworld. Instead of teaming up to stop Kronos, Ares and Hades betray Zeus and transfer his powers to Kronos.
So it’s up to demigod Perseus to rescue his father from Tartarus and stop Granddaddy Kronos from destroying Greece. Of course, a hero’s journey would not be complete without an entourage, and Perseus teams up here with Poseidon’s lay-about demigod son Agenor (Toby Kebbell) and warrior-queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike).
Mythology nerds might be feeling a prickle of apprehension about this. In traditional mythology, Agenor was a king of Tyre long before Zeus made whoopee with Perseus’ mom, and Andromeda was one of legend’s first damsels in distress. Canonical accuracy doesn’t get better than this.
As Perseus, Worthington has a heroic jawline — but that’s about it. Otherwise, he’s just a scruffy guy in a skirt. Pike and Kebbell try their best, but the Getty Villa’s museum cards have more character development than the film’s screenplay does.
The supporting cast, at least, adds a bit of spark. Fiennes crafts Hades as a mix of Voldemort and King John. He’s the only character who changes in the film, and thus is the most interesting. Bill Nighy appears all-too-briefly as a schizophrenic Hephaestus, and he’s much better comic relief than Kebbell as Agenor. And though the film strips Zeus of his pettiness and lechery, Neeson always has a commanding presence. Still, even good actors can’t do much with a bare-bones script.
The characters have legitimate grievances, which are all the kindling needed for interesting character interactions. As it is, though, the relationships are tepid. In mythology, Oedipus’ daddy issues lead to eye-gouging and unintentional incest. Here, Ares’ daddy issues lead to hissy fits and self-righteous fury. Horribleness can have its own kind of glory, but Wrath of the Titans is worse — it’s boring.
Wrath of the Titans’ trailers promised nonstop action and adventure. It might deliver in body, but a spirited reading of The Odyssey will have far more thrills than the film. Despite beautiful vistas and a $150-million budget, the action stays cold and anemic: A giant two-headed chimaera setting itself on fire is a dull affair, and the actual fight with Kronos was done far better in Star Wars.
At one point, the film shudders to life: Two gods put aside their differences and unleash a wave of divine wrath on their enemies. All too short, this scene stands above all the others. Why couldn’t the entire movie be about overpowered guys blowing things up? It worked fine in 300.
In that regard, the film had two possible paths. One could have focused on the pathos of Greek mythology — the human elements of gods and divine heroes that have so enriched historic literature. Exploring Hades’ resentment of Zeus, Ares’ hatred of his father’s bastard children and Kronos’ vengeance against his offspring could have made a rollicking and engaging film.
Or, had the film ditched these obligatory “character-building” scenes and focused on over-the-top fights and pulse-racing action, it could have been ridiculous popcorn fun — not a bad thing if done right, à la 300 and Hard Boiled.
Instead, the film tries to take the Lord of the Rings approach of strong characters and glorious action. Though the film’s cast is far more varied in ability, the action scenes are stiff and blurry and the run time is 99 minutes. Lord of the Rings, it is not.
Wrath of the Titans has an epic enough premise — Greek mythology remains with us to this day for a reason, in archetypes and cultural memes.
Bloated blockbusters, however, do nothing to make ancient heroes more appealing to the youngsters — or amuse their better-read parents.
I only liked this movie because Sam Worthington and Liam Neeson was in it.

Racial profiling should be banned nationwide. 
USC is located in the heart of Los Angeles, in a predominately black and Hispanic neighborhood. The Free Demographics Data of 2011 demonstrates  the dramatic differences between the inner-campus and off-campus communities. According to this data, the 90007 zip code, which immediately surrounds  USC’s campus, is 58.2 percent Hispanic, 16.1 percent white, 12.4 percent black and 10.5 percent Asian. USC’s campus community, accounting for the undergraduate and graduate student bodies, is 74.6 percent white, 39.1 percent Asian, 24.7 percent Hispanic and 10.8 percent black. Blacks and Hispanics often face racial profiling, and are reported as suspicious persons that do not belong by law enforcement officials and community members.
With that in mind, the question raised is: How can someone make the determination that a person does not belong? What, to them, is considered suspicious or not belonging when clearly the demographic representation of the community is predominately minority?
Until federal laws outlaw racial profiling, members of the USC off-campus community will be victimized due to race or skin color.
Recent media attention surrounding a young black man, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, has shaken up and outraged the nation. Martin was gunned down on February 26, 2012, by a white and Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer, 28-year-old George Zimmerman.
According to The Nation, on the night of Martin’s tragic death, Zimmerman spotted Martin and followed him in his car before placing a 911 call to report a “suspicious” person in the area. Zimmerman told the 911 operator, “This guy looks like he’s up to no good, or he’s on drugs or something.” Immediately, Zimmerman began forming a biased opinion about Martin. These details leave many wondering if Martin would have been shot if he had been white.
Ending racial profiling begins with the passage of the End Racial Profiling Act of 2011. The goal of the bill is to eliminate racial profiling in law enforcement and governmental entities.
The nation needs to work on getting this bill passed. Racial profiling harbors serious consequences and has claimed the lives of many innocent minorities.
Martin stands as an unfortunate example of the serious consequences of racial profiling. How long before we have to watch as one of our fellow community members is subjected to the same injustice?

I like being safe on campus. Profile away, DPS!
To Anonymous:
I hope that you are NOT a USC student, because your comment is a disgrace! It’s real easy to be racist when you are anonymous.
I totally agree Karin. That was the point of the article.
Assuming that Trayvon Martin was guiltless before the completion of the ongoing investigations into the case ruined any legitimacy that this article would have had even if it hadn’t advocated stopping one of the most effective crime-prevention measures that any law enforcement group can take.
I’m sorry to inform you that I am. My most sincere apology for making a statement supporting a (perhaps unwritten) policy whose efficacy has been demonstrated time and time again.
Most of the richest people at USC are white….and thus the money that is donated to USC is meant to protect folks from USC which the majority of them are white….
not white + hoodie = suspicious in amerika

Many health experts decry technology for encouraging a sedentary lifestyle. The phrase “couch potato” comes to mind.
But when used properly, technology can help people stay on top of their health.
Public health experts need to start using technology as a tool to help people be healthier, and people need to start using the resources they have at their fingertips.

There is no denying the role that technology plays in the obesity epidemic. A 2008 study using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey found that obesity is positively correlated with the amount of time spent in front of a television or computer screen each day.
Though technology tends to make going out and jogging less appealing, it can also give people the tools and information to get fit.
For example, calorie trackers help people monitor their food intake on a daily basis. While there is the appropriate time to indulge, it is also important to be aware of the calories you are consuming. Livestrong.com/MyPlate allows you to find out what’s in that piece of pizza you ate at your club meeting. Livestrong also allows you to monitor your fitness goals, your nutrient intake and your water intake.
If you’ve ever wondered how far the walk is from your apartment to campus, you can easily find out with the MapMyRun application or website. The application monitors your position and shows your pace, elevation, the distance covered and workout time. If you find a particular route you want to remember for later, you can save your workout. If you do not have a smartphone, you can always go on the website to manually log your workouts.
Technology isn’t just for meals and weekend runs. It can also improve your sex life.
The Internet can combat the dearth of safe-sex education in public schools. Many websites serve as resources for teenagers and young adults who are figuring out their sexual preferences and needs.
Information is now at the fingertips of women who are eager to learn more about their options for pregnancy prevention.
Bedsider.org is a clear, concise encyclopedia of all the birth control options available. It spells out the positive effects, the negative side effects, whether the method protects against STIs and where you can get these methods — some from a provider, some over the counter.
In addition, the website allows users to set up text or email reminders about doctors’ appointments and birth control usage.
Online resources aren’t limited to women. LuckyBloke.com provides a service for people who often find themselves without condoms when they really need them, or for people who are embarrassed about buying condoms at a store.
LuckyBloke allows you to create a custom package of condoms based on a large variety of brands, shapes, sizes and lubricants. A package arrives every month — so there’s no excuse not to have them around. Ten percent of profits go to charities such as It Gets Better and Clean Water.
Though phones, televisions and computers have the potential to promote a more sedentary and unhealthy lifestyle, some applications and websites can do quite the opposite. From ordering a personalized monthly supply of condoms to monitoring workouts, these tools can help promote your health.
Of course, they’re only tools. All the applications in the world won’t help unless you eventually step away from the couch.
