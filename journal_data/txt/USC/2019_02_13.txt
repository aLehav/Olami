Trenton Stone and Mahin Tahsin won the 2019 Undergraduate Student Government election for president and vice president, respectively, beating out two other tickets after a contentious race.
The results of the election, along with the official voter turnout numbers, were announced at a USG meeting Tuesday. Stone and Tahsin ran against the Michaela & Meagan and the Maxwell & Grayson tickets.
The Trenton & Mahin ticket had 2,189 votes, the Michaela & Meagan ticket 1,807 votes, and the Maxwell  & Grayson ticket 554 votes. 267 students abstained.
“As write-ins, it was a huge time pressure,” Stone said. “Going into it, we were so confident that we’ve done the best work we can. I’m happy that it pulled off the way it did.” 
Stone, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, and Tahsin, a junior majoring in business administration and economics, both previously served as USG funding directors.
“It’s definitely been a very tough campaign,” Tahsin said. “We’ve done all of this within three weeks. Trenton and I learned a lot about ourselves and each other.” 
Stone and Tahsin’s campaign focused on increasing civic engagement throughout campus by funding student-run organizations and initiatives. Their platform also included a plan to create an online system that would allow students to interact more directly with the University. . 
“The next thing I want to focus on is getting the right people in USG to accomplish not only our own platform, but the platform of the school and the platform of the student body,” Stone said. 
The two will officially begin their term in early April.
Sen. Meagan Lane said the election rules were unfair, which affected her  campaign with Michaela Murphy. 
 “I don’t think [the election] was set up for us to be successful,” Lane said. “May the best candidate win, but in order for that to happen, the rules have to be fair. I hope that that’s reevaluated, at least in my absence from the organization next year, which I want to make very clear.” 
At the beginning of Feburary, a complaint was filed against Lane’s ticket, alleging that it had violated the USG Elections Code. The USG Elections Commission voted unanimously in Lane’s favor.
Lane and Murphy were initially the sole candidates running for the executive position, until Stone and Tahsin, along with Maxwell Brandon and Grayson Adler, entered the race as write-in candidates. One write-in ticket dropped out before the first debate. 
“Three other tickets were permitted to enter the race without any stipulations,” Lane said. “We found that a lot of the platform points seemed to be oddly reminiscent of some that we had already maybe thought of and published. They got the same money, the same benefits, the same everything. Their names weren’t supposed to be on the ballot, per the Elections Code, but they were.” 
According to the 2019 Elections Code, write-in candidates are permitted to submit their candidacies by Feb. 1. Such candidates’ names are allowed to appear on the ballot if they meet the deadline, the code said. Both the Trenton & Mahin and Maxwell & Grayson tickets submitted their write-in candidacies in late January. 
The USG Elections Committee gathered Friday when a canvasser for Stone and Tahsin allegedly took a student’s phone and voted for them. The Elections Commission unanimously voted against the complaint, stating that a violation of the Elections Code had not occured. 
Brandon, a junior majoring in business administration and accounting said that regardless of the election outcome, he’s hopeful that Stone and Tahsin follow through with their campaign promises.
“I think we gave it a good run,” Brandon said. “It would’ve been nice to win, but we had a lot of fun along the way … We didn’t have have much time to organize, to do as much groundwork as we would’ve liked to do.” 
Brandon and Adler were the only presidential and vice presidential candidates without USG experience. They are both members of the USC chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, the student group responsible for bringing conservative commentator Ben Shapiro to campus in October.
“[Stone and Tahsin should] reach out to the student body, reach out to every individual that [they] can and make sure that all the voices are heard,” Adler said. “I’m sure that Trenton is just as capable, if not more capable to do that.” 
The results of this year’s senatorial race were also announced on Tuesday. The USG 2019-20 Senate comprises Sarah Khoshniyati, Emily Donahue, Haley Garland, Hailey Robertson, Angela Chuang, Emily Johnson, Benjamin Shiff, Ben Rosenthal, Christopher McMorran, Randi Anderson, Omar Garcia and Rose Ritch.

The day after Brenda Ingram was hired to serve as director of USC Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services, the Los Angeles Times broke the story of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall. 
“That told me that USC had a need for [these] services,” she said. “For me, this was the best time to come to USC.”
Since then, Ingram said she has been working to increase the visibility of RSVP on campus. She hopes to create open spaces for students to have safe and honest conversations regarding sexual consent.
“We will sell a hamburger [using] sex but won’t talk about sex,” Ingram said. “Sex is a natural part of life. Just like the air we breathe and the food we eat, it’s a part of the life cycle, but we don’t talk about it. That’s a part of the culture here in the United States.”
Ingram has been working with sexual and domestic abuse survivors for decades, beginning with her undergraduate studies at UCLA, where she received a degree in psychology. She then went on to complete a graduate degree in social work from Sacramento State University, and a doctoral degree in education from the University of Phoenix.
For one of her first internships, Ingram worked at the women’s county jail in Sacramento, where she was exposed to the trauma caused by sexual and domestic violence. She credits this experience as one of the first moments during which she understood the pattern of abuse and the lasting impact it can have on a person’s life.
“My role as an intern was to provide re-entry services and support women into the community,” she said. “So as I listened to their stories, all of them told the stories of how someone in their families had sexually abused them.” 
Shortly after, she began working with the Berkeley Police Department, where she served as a liaison to the domestic women’s shelter and helped with cases of family violence.
When Ingram returned to Los Angeles, she began working in emergency psychiatry, where she noticed that the people with the highest rates of psychiatric emergencies were also trauma survivors. She also noticed that members of marginalized communities, such as people of color and those who come from low-income backgrounds, had higher rates of trauma.
“If you are poor and black, you’ve got two strikes,” Ingram said. “If you’re a poor black woman, you’ve got three strikes. It has a lot to do with racism and classism … the deck, societally speaking, is stacked against you.”
She began to ask herself how to break these patterns of abuse, and what she could do to help end the cycles of trauma.
“Rape culture is what keeps people silent when these happen,” she said. “If women don’t think that the powers that be are going listen to them, then they are not going to report.” 
As RSVP director, Ingram hopes to bring an inclusive perspective. In addition to improving the relationship between RSVP and campus cultural and leadership organizations, Ingram said she is training the LAPD officials to help them become more sensitive with issues of sexual assault by having them understand their unconscious biases. 
“For young women of color who are students on this campus, to see someone like Brenda be in the position she’s in, it kind of creates safer spaces for us to address issues of intersectionality when it comes to our experiences on this campus,” said Sahar Pirzada, a third-year graduate student studying social work.
In the upcoming weeks, RSVP and the University are conducting an initiative called Bringing in the Bystander, in which they will train student leaders, faculty and staff on how to intervene if they see sexual violence on campus.
“I think the collaborations are important to make sure that we’re being mindful of how these conversations can land with survivors in our communities,” Pirzada said. “But I think it’s also about having the events on campus … to make [the services] accessible to the campus community.”
Next fall, RSVP will be training incoming freshmen on affirmative consent, which will teach students how to ask for sex, what consent is and how to be respectful sexual partners. Ingram hopes to help usher in a new era where students are more informed about sexual safety on campus.
“My goal is to make you comfortable talking about sex,” she said. “Because we until we get comfortable talking about sexual relationships, we’re not going go to anywhere stopping sexual assault.” 
This story is part of the Daily Trojan’s special coverage for Black History Month. It will run periodically throughout February.

USC faces yet another legal battle — this time with accusations against former campus doctor Dennis Kelly. Six former students, who identify as gay or bisexual, have filed a lawsuit against the University and doctor, claiming Kelly committed sexual battery, sexual harassment and gender violence against them, according to the complaint. 
Kelly was the only men’s sexual health doctor at the Engemann Student Health Center for nearly 20 years. The physician resigned in August 2018, according to his resignation email, which was obtained by the Daily Trojan. The complaint was filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court by Kellogg & Van Aken LLP, a San Francisco-based firm specializing in civil litigation for sexual assault and abuse cases. 
Kelly is accused of  sexual battery, sexual abuse and discrimination in an educational setting, gender violence and sexual harassment. The lawsuit also claims USC was responsible for fraud, along with negligent hiring and retention. In a statement to the Daily Trojan, a University spokesperson said USC is aware of the lawsuit. 
“We’re working to understand the facts of this matter,” the spokesperson said. “We care deeply about our entire Trojan family, including our LGBTQ+ community, and take this matter very seriously. We will provide more information as it’s available.” 
According to the lawsuit, Kelly subjected patients John Does 1 through 6 to unnecessary rectal examinations. He instructed the plaintiffs to undress in front of him and sit on their hands and knees on the examination table while naked from the waist down. 
“Despite Plaintiff John Doe 1’s lack of symptoms and lack of sexual activity since his last men’s health visit, Dr. Kelly insisted that John Doe 1 have a rectal examination,” the suit read. “John Doe 1 was alarmed and he protested the rectal examination … Dr. Kelly insisted it was necessary … making John Doe 1 feel exposed and extremely uncomfortable.” 
The lawsuit said Kelly refused to give “standard medical covering, drapery or robe for privacy” to the plaintiffs who requested it. 
“Plaintiff John Doe 2 asked Dr. Kelly if he could have some privacy while he undressed or if he could have a robe to cover his body, to which Dr. Kelly refused and made the disturbing and inappropriate comment that it was ‘just us’ and that he was ‘going to see it anyway,’” the lawsuit read. 
During some of the examinations, Kelly used his fingers and medical devices to penetrate the patients’ anuses without providing reason for the treatment, the lawsuit alleged. Kelly used the examinations to “satisfy his own prurient sexual desires and/or to shame, humiliate and embarrass Plaintiffs as a result of their sexual orientation and sexual practices,” it read.
According to the complaint, when plaintiff John Doe 2 saw a female physician during one of his appointments because Kelly was unavailable, she allowed him to undress in private and provided treatment while he laid on his side rather than his hands and knees. The suit said John Doe 2 felt “safe and comfortable” during this meeting, but was told he would have to see Kelly for the remainder of his treatment when he requested to see the female physician again. The lawsuit also alleged Kelly did not subject straight male patients to these examinations. 
Kelly is also accused of discriminating against the plaintiffs because of their sexual orientations, and questioning their sexual history by using “derogatory” terms when he asked about their sexual practices.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, attorneys Mikayla Kellogg and Kelly Van Aken, who represent the six plaintiffs, said they hope USC and Kelly will be held accountable for their actions. 
“Our clients have shown incredible courage in coming forward with their private and sensitive experiences with Dr. Dennis Kelly and are committed to holding USC accountable for failing to protect its students,” the attorneys wrote. “We call on USC to come forward with the truth about what they know and when they knew it. We further call on them to conduct a thorough and independent investigation of these serious allegations and USC’s failure to protect its students.” 
The firm claimed that Kelly took advantage of the campus’ LGBTQ+ community. 
“LGBTQ students are an especially vulnerable population on college campuses,” the firm wrote. “Many of the gay and bisexual men who saw Dr. Kelly were inexperienced with sexual health visits and some were seeing a doctor without a parent present for the first time. We allege that Dr. Kelly took advantage of their vulnerability and inexperience to discriminate against gay and bisexual men and/or to satisfy his own sexual interests.” 
The students listed negligent hiring and retention among the damages listed in the complaint against Kelly. The firm alleges USC was made aware of the allegations and failed to investigate the claims, according to the lawsuit and statement. 
“Despite receiving repeated complaints regarding Dr. Kelly’s misconduct, USC actively and deliberately failed to investigate, discipline or address Dr. Kelly’s sexually abusive and discriminatory behavior and instead continued to employ Dr. Kelly for years,” the suit read. 
One sophomore, who identifies as a gay male but asked to remain anonymous for privacy reasons, said he had his first sexual health checkup with Kelly last spring. He said Kelly asked about his use of dating apps, which two of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit cited as reasons for their discomfort. 
“I felt like he asked me a lot of weirdly invasive questions about the type of sex I was having and how often I was having sex that in my opinion I felt weren’t necessary,” he said. 
He said the emerging details of the lawsuit have made him consider coming forward, but that he wants to wait to hear more about the allegations. Kellogg & Van Aken LLP currently has a page on its website for former patients of Kelly to report their experiences including instances of inappropriate touching and invasive questioning. 
“[The new lawsuit] put my experience into perspective and [made me feel] that my feelings were valid,” he said. 
Kelly has worked as a men’s health specialist at Cal State Northridge since 2002. Though he is still employed by CSUN, the university’s Media Relations said he has been placed on administrative leave.
“At this time, we are not aware of any complaints against Dr. Kelly from any member of the CSUN community,” CSUN said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “The health and safety of our students is our top priority. We take the disturbing allegations by the former USC students, as well as any sexual assault, battery or harassment allegation against anyone at the university, seriously.” 
Kellogg & Van Aken LLP is asking individuals who have experienced abuse or discrimination and want a consultation or information to contact the firm via its website.

Following the end of the 2019 Undergraduate Student Government elections, 4,817 students voted, a 4.1 percent increase from last year’s 4,627 votes.
This year’s elections deviated from last year’s  downward trend when voter turnout for the 2018 election decreased by 800 votes from the  2017 election.
The Trenton & Mahin ticket won the election with 2,189 votes. The Michaela & Meagan ticket earned 1,807 votes and the Maxwell & Grayson ticket earned 554 votes. No one ticket garnered over 50 percent of the votes. Approximately 45.4 percent of student voters chose the newly elected presidential ticket.
Of approximately 20,000  undergraduate students, 24.1 percent voted in the election cycle.
“As students, we’re the [ones] paying tuition,” said voter Kelsea Nanan, a freshman majoring in neuroscience. “It’s our school for four years. I think students should be more informed about what the student government is doing for us and how they’re changing the campus climate that [affects] the way that we live every day.”
Out of the elected senators, Sara Khoshniyati, Emily Donahue and Haley Garland received the greatest amount of votes with 1,442 votes, 1,419 votes and 1,409 votes, respectively. Rose Ritch narrowly clinched the twelfth and final senatorial seat, beating Gabriel Savage by three votes. Ritch received 1,046 votes and Savage received 1,043 votes. 
Of those who voted for a presidential ticket, 584 students abstained from voting for senatorial candidates. 
Students were able to cast votes last week online via the USG elections website or in person at USG booths located throughout campus. 
USG also incentivized students to participate in the election by offering free In-N-Out to students who voted on the final day.

The Undergraduate Student Government introduced a resolution Tuesday that will require all recognized student organizations to send representatives to an annual bystander intervention training for student leadership. This follows recent incidents of sexual harassment and assault at USC, including alleged sexual misconduct by former campus gynecologist George Tyndall.
“Bystander training is a really effective tool in combating those causes,” said Co-Chief Diversity Officer Shany Ebadi, who co-authored the resolution with senators Diviya Gupta and Jillian Halperin and senator and Speaker Pro Tempore Matthew Crane. “[We need to take] a step back and [realize] what is the environment, what are the factors that are cultivating the environment for sexual harassment and assault to occur, what communities are perpetuating it and how we can better educate each other and ourselves and [make] sure it doesn’t happen.” 
According to the resolution, current sexual assault intervention training standards are not applicable to much of the student body. The proposed training will require RSOs to send representatives beginning in Fall 2020, the resolution said. One individual will be able to represent up to two RSOs. Crane said there will be multiple training sessions throughout the school year to accommodate the over 1,000 RSOs on campus.
“Priority No. 1 — always protect your students because if they’re not protected, how can we learn? How can they grow?” Sen. Shayan Kohanteb said. “How can they make friends? How can they do anything? So, I think it was the first step that was so needed — years ago. This is going to be what really propels us into fixing the process of making this a safe place for students.” 
USC is expecting 15 student leaders and 25 faculty and staff members to attend the Bringing in the Bystander event on Feb. 23. The program will focus on providing an evidence-based, train-the-trainer model to teach bystanders how to intervene in high-risk situations.
“We’re going to have professionals come in and train key student leaders and then hopefully have those student leaders pass on their knowledge to their organizations and hold everybody accountable,” Ebadi said. “Knowing we can have a point person at each RSO that is certified and are able to combat that kind of assault is going to be really helpful for us.” 
The resolution has received support from 67 student organizations, including the Academic Culture Assembly, Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment and the Black Student Assembly. It has also received support from Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services.
“The University of Southern California has seen recent institutional turmoil through a number of scandals involving response to sexual assault or sexual harassment and has resolved to respond through institutional reform and policy development,” the resolution read. 
USG intends to transition leadership of the initiative to RSVP and the Student Affairs Goal 4 Committee during the 2019-20 academic year, the resolution said. USG will put $5,000 toward funding the initiative.
“As soon as we started participating in that conversation, it became clear that just doing small things wasn’t gonna be enough,” Crane said. “We had to really tap into existing social structures with student organizations. We want to make it wide-reaching. RSVP was a huge partner for us … They helped to fund it.”

After spending several weeks in the No. 2 slot of the conference, the men’s basketball team is looking to bounce back from a losing skid at home with a pair of road games in the Bay Area. 
The Trojans will take on Stanford and Cal, facing off against two of the lowest-ranked teams in the Pac-12 with the hope of maintaining the edge of a winning conference record. The team has already faced and beaten both teams this season, but it will have to repeat that feat on the road to continue fighting for a spot in an extremely balanced Pac-12 conference.
The Trojans will start out in Palo Alto on Wednesday against Stanford, a team which holds a 5-6 record in conference play. When the teams met earlier this season, the Trojans cruised to a 77-66 win, with forwards junior Nick Rakocevic and senior Bennie Boatwright combining for 45 points. The Cardinal have gone 5-4 since the loss, most recently suffering a 23-point defeat to Oregon.
Next, the team will face Cal, which has yet to win a Pac-12 game. The Trojans beat Cal when it visited the Galen Center earlier this year, but the 9-point victory wasn’t especially flashy for the Trojans, who leaned heavily on Rakocevic to sneak out the win. On the road, the Trojans will need an early lead to put away the Bears, who are desperate to notch a win in the second half of the season.
With a record of 1-4 over the past two weeks, the Trojans fell to the middle of the conference rankings after the weekend’s games. USC struggled at Galen Center over the weekend, falling to both Utah and Colorado by less than 10 points. In post-game interviews, Enfield seemed unfazed by the pair of losses.
“It was a typical Pac-12 game,” Enfield said after the Colorado game. “It’s usually close at halftime. It was a matter of defending and executing. We didn’t play a bad game, but they had a lot of layups.”
His attitude was more severe after the first loss to Utah, which Enfield described as the team’s “worst effort in a long time.” Against Utah, the Trojans only tallied 12 assists, their worst statistic of the season. Both Enfield and the team recognize the necessity for change, especially late in the game, to continue clinching games that stay close into the final minutes.
One major change over recent weeks has been the return of freshman Kevin Porter Jr., who was sidelined with injuries and a suspension throughout the season. When he had time on the court, Porter demonstrated himself a potent shooter, dropping 14 points in his post-suspension debut against Arizona. Still nursing a thigh bruise from several weeks ago, the freshman is working to get back on his feet, but his continued presence offers another outlet for the team to expand its depth in close games, Enfield and Porter said.
“Our team is very contagious both ways,” Enfield said. “When we’re sharing the basketball, making the extra pass or driving or posting up, everybody starts to do it. When we start taking bad shots, it seems like everybody starts taking bad shots or contested or rushed shots.”
With only seven games left in the regular season, the Trojans have officially entered crunch time. The team is ranked No. 5 in the conference, but three teams are tied for second, meaning that a winning streak to close the season could leave the team well-poised to take a top spot in the Pac-12. In a mediocre season with nothing but parity, the Pac-12 title isn’t out of reach for USC — but the path to it will be paved on the road.

The USC baseball team looks to bounce back from a below .500 2018 season and reclaim its spot at the top of the Pac-12 with the season beginning Friday against Nebraska Omaha.
The Trojans have secured 12 NCAA baseball titles, doubling the record of any other team in the nation. Over 130 seasons, they have led the Pac-12 with 38 conference championships and a .634 winning percentage.
In recent years, however, USC has suffered a different fate. The Trojans have not claimed a College World Series title since 1998, won a conference championship since 2002 or finished a season with a winning record since 2015.
USC will have to overcome the loss of three key players to the 2018 MLB Draft. Right-handed pitcher Solomon Bates and outfielder Lars Nootbaar were selected in the eighth round and first basemen Dillon Paulson was selected in the 13th. None will be returning to USC for their senior seasons.
Of course, the three players selected in the draft weren’t the only contributors in 2018, and the team will look for strong performances from its remaining key players, if they want to find success on the diamond this season. 
Redshirt junior catcher Kaleb Murphy will look to build on a 2018 season that saw him lead the Trojans with a .333 batting average and a .376 on-base percentage, fitting for second on the team. Murphy threw out 16 percent of would-be base-stealers in 2018 and will aim to increase that figure to minimize the running game against the Trojans.
Junior catcher/outfielder Blake Sabol posted a .390 slugging percentage for the Trojans in 2018 with a .425 in conference play, second only to Paulson’s mark of .500. Sabol was a mainstay in the lineup for the 2018 club, starting all 54 games for the Trojans last season. At 6-foot-4 and 215 pounds, Sabol led the Trojans with eight stolen bases for a perfect success rate last year. He made only one error for a .996 fielding percentage, cranking four home runs on the season and earning himself an All Pac-12 honorable mention.
In his first season at USC since  transferring from Georgetown University, senior infielder Chase Bushor appeared in 52 games for the Trojans in 2018, posting a batting average of just above .300. Bushor finished the season with 52 hits — second only to Sabol — 11 of them for extra bases and a .382 slugging percentage for second among returning Trojans. Bushor helped lead USC’s middle infield to 0.91 double plays per game, just a tick behind Washington State for first in the Pac-12. Bushor finished the year with an 11-game hitting streak.
Sophomore right-handed pitcher Kyle Hurt will look to fill the void left by Bates in 2019. Hurt led the Trojans with 81.1 innings pitched on the year and started 14 games for USC, accumulating a 4.76 earned run average and holding opposing hitters to a modest .238 batting average. 
Junior pitcher Connor Lunn and sophomore pitcher John Beller were integral parts of the Trojans’ bullpen in 2018, and they will play key roles on the mound this season. Pitcher Quentin Longrie will also add to the Trojans’ prowess in 2019.
According to Perfect Game, the Trojans boast the No. 16 best freshman recruiting class in the country for the class of 2018. Outfielder Preston Hartsell is the highest ranked in the Trojans’ class, coming in at No. 15 in the nation. Pitcher Chandler Champlain ranks No. 34, and he was selected in the 38th round of the 2018 MLB Draft by the Los Angeles Angels while ranked the 120th best prospect in his draft class. Pitcher Ethan Reed was the fourth-ranked pitcher in California, ranked at No. 39 overall nationally.
The Trojans add to their impressive recruiting class with infielder Emilio Rosas, ranked No. 54 by Perfect Game for the 2018 class. Pitchers Carson Lambert and Calvin Schapira and catcher/third baseman Clay Owens also ranked in the top 500 nationally.
Six other freshmen round out the Trojans’ stacked class of 2022, which ranked higher than any other Pac-12 or West Coast team.
USC kicks off the 2019 season with a three-game home series against Nebraska Omaha at Dedeaux Field this weekend. Friday’s season opener will start at 6 p.m., Saturday’s matchup is at 2 p.m. and Sunday’s finale is at 12 p.m.

Trojan baseball is coming back to Dedeaux Field this Friday in a season that can go either way for the Trojans. On one hand, USC hasn’t had a winning season since 2015 and that losing culture may prevail inside the team’s locker room, if it does not start off strong. However, there is evidence suggesting that these Trojans have the potential to prove their doubters wrong and claim their first winning season since 2015. The bottom line? There are positives for USC baseball this season.The first positive for the Trojans is that they are all returning players — except for the first baseman — who played key roles last season.The middle infield is loaded with talent from players such as senior Brandon Perez, senior Chase Bushor and sophomore Ben Ramirez. Last season, Ramirez started off the campaign strong at shortstop, living up to the hype that surrounded him after he was drafted the year before. Nothing seemed to faze Ramirez, who hit lights out and made unbelievable plays in the field until he got injured. While he struggled to come back from the injury and play at the same elite level. Ramire proved his talent in his first few collegiate games.During Ramirez’s absence, Bushor stepped up and filled the gap at shortstop. After a few games, it became evident that it was Bushor’s spot to lose, as he not only fielded well but was also one of the most consistent batters on the team, despite starting the season as a backup. He finished the year second on the team with a .301 batting average.Brandon Perez is another player worth watching. While he didn’t bat very consistently last season, finishing only .237 on the year, he earned Gold Glove honors as the top defensive third baseman in the country. If he finds a better groove hitting the ball this season, the Trojans may have one of the best infielders in the Pac-12. His leadership on and off the field will be vital to the team’s success this season.Switching over to the outfield, junior outfielder Matthew Acosta has the potential to become a Pac-12 star this season. Acosta competes at an elite level with a powerful bat and great fielding ability. Last year, Acosta failed to find consistency in performances every game, but he still showed glimpses of his true potential. If head coach Dan Hubbs can find a way to bring out more consistency from Acosta, the Trojans will have a constant RBI threat that pitchers fear. Last season, Acosta finished with a .263 batting average and 26 RBI. Acosta is capable of being the team’s go-to player at the plate, but he will have to improve those numbers first.Moreover, there is room for improvement in pitching, and some of the Trojans have already shown glimpses of brilliance. Sophomore pitcher Kyle Hurt is a prime example of a player that promises to be one of the best pitchers not only in the conference, but also in the NCAA. The sophomore was drafted two years ago, but decided to forgo the draft and play college baseball for the Trojans. He had a turbulent year, finishing at 4-5 with a 4.76 ERA. However, during the season, he managed to pitch a no-hitter as a freshman in a Pac-12 game against Utah. Hurt reaches above 90 miles per hour with his fastball. If he can find more consistent control, Hurt can prove a challenge for opposing batters.In relief, junior pitcher Connor Lunn has the ability to take care of leads and close out games for the Trojans. Lunn was recently placed on the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association watch list for top relievers in the country. If the Trojans can find a way to lead late in games, they should be confident that Lunn can finish teams off with ease.The Trojans did lose some key players last season, including Dillon Paulson at first base, Lars Nootbaar in the outfield and Solomon Bates on the mound. Paulson and Nootbaar offered powerful bats and a home run threat every time they stepped up to the plate, and Bates was the Trojans’ best pitcher. However, the Trojans will come into the year with more starters who have collegiate baseball experience. If the Trojans can start the season strong and find their momentum, they will find success. However, the Arkansas series in the second week of the season could be an obstacle for USC. If they do well in that series, the team will prove that it may see a winning season once again.

Despite the common assumption that anyone can get into podcasting because of its low barrier to entry (a good microphone and an easy-to-learn audio editing software don’t cost more than a couple hundred dollars), the industry is still dominated by one specific genre: two white guys chatting about, well, nothing. Often times, it can be difficult to find podcasts that talk about issues affecting people of color or podcasts hosted by people of color.  
As part of our special coverage for Black History Month, the Daily Trojan is highlighting four podcasts made by black producers about black issues and black stories.  
Code Switch
Hosted primarily by black American Gene Demby and Puerto Rican-Iranian American Shereen Marisol Meragi, NPR’s “Code Switch” succeeds with  the high-level production and well-researched content one expects from NPR, while also allowing the hosts to buck the “objectivity” requirements of standard journalism. In the series, the hosts employ personal experiences in their discussions of race and diversity. 
The title “Code Switch” refers to the common practice among people of color whereby individuals change the way they express themselves in different environments because of their race. It’s an apt title, because Meraji and Demby code-switch constantly throughout the podcast; they navigate a fine line between bringing racial issues to light for NPR’s predominantly white audience, while also addressing the lack of obligation they have for explaining race to a majority white audience. 
One of the podcast’s most stellar episodes, “Hold Up! Time for an Explanatory Comma,” discusses the responsibility often placed on people of color to be ‘experts’ on their respective race or culture, while in reality, they shouldn’t have to be the ambassadors for an entire group of people. Each of their projects constantly challenges listeners to rethink the ways they view racial issues, and also serves as an educational tool — a professor at the University of Texas San Antonio used the podcast as a blueprint for her class (you can hear more about it on the episode, “Code Switch Goes to College”). 
Tune in to “Code Switch” for thought-provoking and innovative conversations about race and culture in the United States.
The Stoop
“The Stoop’s” tagline is “Stories from across the black diaspora,” but hosts Hana Baba, a Sudanese American, and Leila Day, a black American, often use another one: “Yes, we’re going there.” And on most of their episodes, they talk about issues that most podcasts wouldn’t dare approach. 
On their inaugural episode, Baba and Day approach cultural appropriation; not exactly the kind you might imagine. The two discuss whether black Americans should be allowed to wear cultural, tribal clothing that originates from Africa. They talk about the issue candidly, unafraid to disagree with each other or avoid making a definite decision. 
Day and Baba use “stoop” as a verb in each episode, as a kind of catch-all word for the frank style of discussion they bring to the table. While it’s primarily a chat-based podcast, both Day and Baba are public radio journalists by trade. They bring in interviews, man-on-the-street reporting and compelling music throughout their episodes to bring life to the traditional two-person discussion format. 
Another thing that sets the podcast apart is its focus on not only black Americans, but also continental Africans; on “Back to Africa,” they discuss African immigrants who come to the U.S. only to end up returning to live in Africa, and on the episode “You Called Me African What?” they consider the perceived disconnect between black Americans and African immigrants. 
Compared to “Code Switch,”  it’s clear that “The Stoop” doesn’t restrain itself or try to appeal to a white audience. The podcast is by people of color, for people of color. 
Strong Black Legends 
From Netflix and its media initiative Strong Black Lead, “Strong Black Legends” debuted Feb. 11 this year. Although only one episode has been released, the podcast promises to impress with its experienced host, talented guest list and Netflix’s history of well-produced podcasts.
Tracy Clayton, the former co-host of Buzzfeed’s “Another Round” podcast (currently on hiatus), is leading the show. “Another Round,” a discussion show about race, gender and popular culture, was named an iTunes Best Podcast of 2015 before it went on break. 
Clayton is the perfect host for “Strong Black Legends.” She knows how to host a podcast well, and her engaging personality bolsters the show’s main purpose. Like the Strong Black Lead media initiative, “Strong Black Legends” aims to feature prominent black actors, black directors and other black creatives in Hollywood. 
In its first episode, Clayton interviews Lynn Whitfield, who most recently acted in the “Greenleaf” television series. Future interviewees include Ruth E. Carter, an Oscar nominee for Best Costume Design for her work on “Black Panther” and actress Loretta Devine, who has appeared in television shows like “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Supernatural.” 
The show promises to honor these people of color and their achievements in an industry that often makes it hard for black Americans to achieve success. While listeners might not immediately think of Netflix as a podcast provider, the streaming giant now boasts five well-created shows — “Strong Black Legends” should be no different.
Two Dope Queens
Arguably the most popular podcast on this list, “Two Dope Queens” has already seen major success. Before airing its final episode (featuring none other than Michelle Obama) last November, the titular duo, Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams, hosted a series of HBO specials and a live tour based on the podcast. 
The podcast started with a simple yet quickly popular concept: Each week, the hosts recorded a live show featuring a slate of comedians performing standup (usually people of color) all MC’ed by Robinson and Williams. The duo have an unrivaled chemistry; they’re able to laugh with and at each other while discussing important race-based issues in a comedic way. 
Robinson and Williams are irreverent and unafraid, taking control of their show in an easygoing yet commanding manner. Although the comedians featured on the show sometimes have less engaging sets, for the most part, they are just as funny as the hosts. 
As the show grew in popularity, it started featuring interviews with high-profile comedians like SNL alumna Vanessa Bayer. The hosts’ chemistry leaks into the interviews too, bringing a fresh take on the traditional interview that draws out their guests’ humor in new ways. 
While the WNYC podcast no longer puts out new episodes, its 49-episode archive is a treasure trove you can binge listen to over and over again. Moreover, Robinson started a spinoff podcast, “Sooo Many White Guys,” which directly aims to reverse the “token black woman” trope by featuring conversations with people who aren’t white and male.

A visit to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles conjures images of prehistoric creatures and brightly colored jewels. 
However, the new exhibit, “That was then. This is now.,” opens a window into a different lens on history: The postnatural forms of organisms through change due to human alterations.
The artist, Richard Pell, a professor of media art at Carnegie Mellon university, specializes in research exploring how new technologies affect society.
Located in a small room between the central corridors and its 3-D theater,  Pell’s latest exhibit presents his subjects through various mediums. Photographs hang on the back wall, depicting body parts, heads and skulls from numerous animal and plant species. 
Dead organisms inside glass enclosures line the left and right sides of the exhibit. Spread throughout the room are large texts explaining the postnatural, combined with the dimly-lit specimen to create an eerie yet powerful atmosphere.
At first glance, the exhibit seems to emit a lifeless tranquility. The subjects appear frozen in time, stuck within their cases.
 Some of the animals even have their eyes open, reinforcing the ominous aura permeating the exhibit. Others evoke fear. One of the jars contained a hairless and overweight rat. Everything seems unsettling, so much so that some visitors avoid looking at them at all.
However, upon further inspection, the technique Pell employs to bring the pieces to life becomes apparent. Antique telephones placed below each specimen allow visitors to listen to auditory explanations of historical experiments. 
The short two- to three-minute stories delve into topics that ranged from educational tales to humorous factoids. Some of the  narratives focused on the human desire to protect itself from the unknown, which eventually lead to scientific discoveries, featuring rats that helped develop alcohol addiction treatment and genetically modified mosquitoes that cannot carry the dengue fever virus. Other examples are more whimsical, such as photosynthetic bacteria that spelled out phrases such as “Hello World” by using a specialized light source.
The photographs on the back wall offer another unique viewing method, using 3-D glasses to showcase the subject matter. 
Visitors are encouraged to don tinted glasses to reveal details in these representations. 
Deformations in an alligator’s skull and spider silk inside goat tissue become visible and appear to jump off the canvas. 
Through the pictures, one can easily spot the alterations, and human manipulation shines because of their “superior power,” a term the artist uses to describe his work.
Another example of man’s control over the natural world is the Birmingham roller pigeon specimen. 
When visitors pull the telephone below the specimen to listen, a lifeless bird spins in circles inside a glass box.
This simple installation, along with the narrative, highlights the absurdity of the power humans have over other beings. Humans specifically bred the birds to enhance their ability to perform rapid backward somersaults while flying, a trait that has no purpose for the pigeons and exists solely for human entertainment and commercial value. 
While the exhibit is confined between the walls of a small space, “That was then. This is now.” holds a larger message of how human intentions affect the way the world evolves. The works provide an informal and insightful way to discuss how humans have altered the world through processes such as selective breeding and genetic engineering. 
Touching on both the positives and negatives, Pell showcases the fascinating and horrifying ways organisms both benefit from and are harmed by human interactions. 
The exhibit will run at NHMLA through April 28. Admission is free for USC students, staff and faculty with a valid USC ID.

Growing up, there was one work of art that defined my childhood memories, and I can visualize it most clearly in my mind’s eye. I didn’t know it then, but Gustav Klimt’s “The Kiss” was so much more than a framed print of two people kissing that decorated the wall in my parents’ bedroom. I remember first seeing it as a patterned, yellow blob — the man and woman, abstractly composed, are so closely intertwined that their robed bodies are practically merged as one. Some years later, I finally came to recognize them as blissful lovers, shrouded in gold. Naturally, I saw them as projections of my parents, who were the premier model of romance in my life at the time. 
In the painting, Klimt enhances the lovers’ physical and emotional intimacy through the closeness of their bodies and the realism in their expressions. Even as a little girl with negligible art history knowledge, I recognized the euphoria and obsession in their postures and faces — these were two people who reveled in each other’s presence. Naturally, I wanted what they had for myself someday. 
At the risk of sounding precocious beyond my 20 years, I’ve done quite a bit more living and learning than that little girl I used to be. Shit happens. Boys break your heart. Parents split up. Call it poor taste in partners or a symptom of having parents currently in the midst of a contentious divorce, but over the years, I have inadvertently become a staunch cynic when it comes to love. Suddenly, all signs seemed to point to the futility of love and the deceit behind Klimt’s portrayal. I can’t help but wonder if Klimt’s lovers knew their only options were to break up or die together.
Unfortunately, visions and iconography of love are inescapable — especially as the capitalistic gears of Valentine’s Day churn this week. In art history especially, portrayals of love smolder in every period and genre. Whether through tender gazes, flirtatious poses or ravenous embraces, art has long rendered acts of desire and romance to capture the all-encompassing, mind-altering effects of the drug we call love. 
Lucky for us skeptics, not all these iterations of love are as idealized as Klimt’s. Rene Magritte’s “The Lovers” alternatively visualizes the complexities of love, particularly the interactions between the mind and heart. Its subjects are a man and a woman with their lips interlocked, their heads cloaked by fabric, so their identities are erased. Despite the passion evident in their body language, the depersonalized nature of the work draws upon darker themes of frustrated desire, obstructed intimacy and unsolicited obsession. The lovers are suffocating one another, yet their lust transcends their suffering. To me, Magritte is illustrating a side of love that is no less real than the romantic stuff, even if it’s not as pretty.
Not only is real love less pretty, it can be downright dirty, according to photographer Nan Goldin’s “The Ballad of Sexual Dependency.” Goldin’s exhibition-turned-visual diary chronicles her friends, family and lovers’ struggles to find intimacy in Reagan-era New York City during the counterculture movement. The photographs document scenes of love and sex as experienced in Goldin’s underground world — a scantily-clad young couple hungrily making out with drug paraphernalia littered around them, a woman’s face bruised at the hands of her domestic abuser, a wrenching portrait of a couple collapsed in each other’s arms on a decrepit couch. The images are a meditations on the nuanced forms love and romance can take. Visceral and raw, they strip away all illusion and expose the primal human desire for affection and connection. 
At the end of the day, no depiction of love in art emerges as the truest. I have been kissed by someone who held me with the gentle infatuation Klimt’s subjects exhibit. I have ached for someone so badly that I’d sooner be suffocated like Magritte’s characters than be without them. I have performed my own ballads of sexual dependence in an attempt to make meaning of the gray areas. As it turns out, every depiction has its merits because it teaches us something new about how to love. 
My days of blindly heralding Klimt’s painting as the golden standard of love may be long over, but art reminds me that loving and being loved are what make life worthwhile. In all its forms, love is worth pursuing, having and losing. And despite my cynicism, I’m excited to experience all the soaring highs and harrowing lows my next love might bring. 
Now long forgotten by both my parents, “The Kiss” still hangs in our empty basement guest room, a relic of the flawless love I once believed in. But maybe someday, when I find the perfect person with whom to share a flawed but no less legitimate love, I’ll ask if I can have it for our bedroom wall.

NASA announced last week that 2018 was the fourth warmest year ever recorded. Following a trend of continued warming, it’s clear that things aren’t getting much better for the planet. As humans, we’re contributing to climate change with every choice we make. 
To combat this, we must reduce our carbon footprint. Cutting down on how much carbon humans emit is crucial to stymying climate change. Every decision we make affects that footprint — even those as seemingly trivial as shopping  online instead of driving to a brick-and-mortar store. 
What is the more sustainable option? Should you drive the 28 miles round-trip to LUSH on Third Street Promenade to restock on your bath bombs or order them online and have them delivered? 
The annoying but honest answer? It depends. 
Products have to be shipped regardless, whether it’s to your doorstep or to the store. But driving a passenger car 20 miles round-trip without carpooling is simply wasteful. Using a car is probably more efficient than using a diesel delivery truck. However, the delivery truck will make multiple deliveries on the road anyway. 
Also, delivery trucks are more efficient than ever, due to the correlation between efficient delivery and cost-effectiveness for companies, unless you’ve selected two-day rush shipping. Most often, rush orders require a separate delivery truck to go out, adding to the number of trucks on the road and amount of emissions released. 
According to a study from The Center for Energy and Climate Solutions, consumers can minimize the environmental impact of online shopping by choosing the slowest delivery method available. A 20-mile round trip to buy two small products consumes about one gallon of gas. But having those same packages shipped 1,000 miles in a delivery truck uses only one-tenth of a gallon, the study states. 
When someone orders a product online, each individual item has to be packaged in a separate parcel. If someone orders a bunch of things that will ship separately, which happens often with Amazon, it would mean even more wasteful packaging. 
Another factor to consider is the type of item being purchased. Clothing often ends up returned because of wrong sizes or fits. This would require an extra trip, whether the consumer ends up driving it to the store or sending it back through the mail. 
If you’re planning to buy clothes, it would be better to drive to the physical store to try on the items to ensure a good fit before purchasing. But it’s also important to consider that a physical storefront requires more energy to run the lighting, air conditioning and other systems than a warehouse. 
Ordering items in bundles and choosing standard shipping is ultimately the most sustainable route most of the time. However, if you need something within the next day or two from a store that is within 20 miles back and forth, it would be better to drive to the store and pick it up yourself. An even more sustainable option would be to hop on public transit to a local store. You could even ride a bike to get there.
Like most decisions surrounding sustainability, choosing the best option for shopping requires nuance. What is important is that you consider the impact of the choices you are making. Being aware of the impact we are having on this planet, no matter how small a decision it may seem, is paramount to thwarting climate change and saving this beautiful pale blue dot.

Despite already facing challenges in the transition from high school to college, USC freshmen often take on difficult courses such as the mandatory — and notorious — “Writing 150: Writing and Critical Reasoning – Thematic Approaches.”  
While the course intends to teach new students valuable writing strategies, it does so at the expense of obsession over letter grades and conformity in the writing process. Because these disadvantages tend to overshadow WRIT 150’s stated purpose, the University should restructure the course to help students improve their writing skills in less restrictive ways.
The course currently promises a “rich and rewarding intellectual experience” in its online description. Instead, the rapid pace and stress of the course does not allow for a natural development of writing and reasoning. It takes away from both a new student’s freshman experience at USC and the development of their writing style. 
The course description also claims to encourage creativity and a break from the typical five-paragraph essay structure taught in most schools. While it does deviate from this method, it still bases the actual writing process around a rigidity that detracts from true creativity and uniqueness.
Starting with an “invention process” as described by the course book, the writing process shifts to a rough plan, a rough draft and, finally, a final draft. Students, however, communicate their ideas differently, and although this “invention process” may be useful for some, it can be restricting for others. 
Additionally, the WRIT 150 course book corrals students into a constrictive mindset regarding essay writing. Even though the writing strategies taught are more nuanced, they often limit students to only one type of “correct” writing when there are numerous methods and approaches to creative and expository writing.
Early grades can often set the tone for a semester, and this is even more impactful during a student’s first few semesters. Getting a low grade in a mandatory course that should follow the bell curve grading expected of mandatory freshman courses is one that may be demoralizing for some students, discouraging them from thinking outside the box. This detracts from an open and creative learning space and promotes undue concern over grades. In some WRIT 150 courses, students often receive a low grade on the first essay, a moderate grade on the second essay and the highest grade on the final essay. This trend passes by word of mouth from students who have already taken the course, encouraging an obsession over an unachievable A in the course.
While there are certainly a few shortcomings with the course structure and ideology, WRIT 150 does offer students benefits not found in any other course at USC. It introduces students to academic writing in a unique environment, teaching them the skills necessary for academic success. Additionally, thematic approaches allow students to explore writing through a topic or subject that they can engage with.
Difficult writing courses are a staple of many universities, but they are often implemented in different ways. Brown University, for example, offers a range of courses that students can take to complete their writing requirement. Traditional writing courses are offered alongside different English, comparative literature and literary arts courses.
Brown’s writing curriculum helps students specialize their writing in conjunction with an upper-level course similar to WRIT 340 at USC. The University of California system, however, allows students to forego their entry-level writing requirement if they score at least 30 on the ACT English section or 680 on the SAT Writing and Language section, according to the UC Irvine course catalogue. USC should consider adopting alternatives that their peer universities are using to help enhance the writing experience and prioritize student growth. 
One of the most beneficial changes that should be made to WRIT 150 is to make it a pass/no pass class. This would help students learn academic writing with a clearer focus and give students enough agency to experiment and develop their unique writing styles. Instead of trying to write a paper with the preferences of their instructor in mind, students can feel less pressured and be more creative. Ultimately, WRIT 150 should be about helping students make progress on their writing — not about getting the perfect grade.
