With signing day now behind us, a new recruiting class in the books and a lot of optimism about USC football’s  future, I wanted to take a second to reminisce about a special someone. Someone who was always regarded as a top-notch recruiter and was loved by all. I’m talking, of course, about former USC head coach and current Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin.
When critics used to talk about Kiff’s lack of coaching prowess, they would always go back to what a great recruiter he was and how he was always able to bring all this great talent to USC amid the sanctions that arose from the Pete Carroll era.
During his tenure, Kiffin brought in superstars such as Marqise Lee, Nelson Agholor, Su’a Cravens — the list goes on and on.
But was Kiffin solely responsible for bringing in all of this talent? He received plenty of credit and was seen as a star recruiter who was able to get highly touted players to come to USC, but people forget that while coaches are influential in players’ decisions, USC’s program sells itself and should be considered its most powerful recruiting tool.
The tradition of excellence in not only USC football but all of its athletics in general is definitely a key selling point to recruits. Ten national titles, six Heisman Trophy winners, 38 conference titles, 80 Consensus All-Americans — and boom, signed. With our rich and successful history, it should honestly be that easy.
It just takes a quick visit to the newly renovated Heritage Hall to feel the aura that surrounds USC football. The athletic department has clearly put in ample time and effort to make sure that USC boasts world-class facilities such as the John McKay Center and to make sure that only the cream of the crop come to USC to experience them.
At USC, we are fortunate to be able to sell this aura and these top-notch facilities to recruits, and this is what Athletic Director Pat Haden envisioned when he took over for Mike Garrett in 2010. Ultimately, this is what sets our school apart from other Pac-12 schools such as UCLA and Oregon.
When Haden initially hired Steve Sarkisian to head the USC football program, many in the USC community were underwhelmed. A lot of people said that Haden didn’t hit a home run or it wasn’t a sexy hire, but putting all of that aside, USC has always been, and always will be seen as a sexy location to recruits.
On National Signing Day, Sarkisian got commitments from a handful of high-profile recruits, and I believe under the circumstances, with a coaching transition and limited time and resources, Sarkisian hit the 2014 class out of the park.
When the Trojans picked up official letters of intent from the “Big Three,” (No. 3 athlete John “JuJu” Smith of Long Beach Poly, No. 1 guard Damien Mama of St. John Bosco-Bellflower and No. 1 overall California prospect Adoree’ Jackson), the USC coaching staff knew that they had truly accomplished what they set out to do on signing day.
These commitments boosted USC’s 2014 recruiting class from outside the nation’s top 20 and fifth in the conference to No. 11 nationally and the best class in the Pac-12, according to 247Sports.
In the process, Sarkisian was able to address the skill positions where the team was looking to add depth, including the offensive line and the secondary. What makes it sweeter is that Sarkisian was able to beat out rivals UCLA, Notre Dame and Oregon for these players.
Sarkisian grew up in Torrance, Calif., and his acquaintance with the area has been key to his success in recruiting. Even at Washington, he was seen as one of the best recruiters of Southern California high school football players. Fifteen of the 19 signees yesterday were from the state of California.
Sarkisian didn’t do it alone, though, and a lot of credit should be given to wide receivers coach Tee Martin. As USC’s recruiting ace, Martin did his part in hauling in some of Southern California’s top recruits including five-star prospect Jackson. According to Rivals, Martin was responsible for 11 of the 19 recruits, 10 of those coming from Southern California.
With the 2014 class complete and an official end to sanctions coming Wednesday, it’s time for the USC football team to get back on the playing field and gear up for spring ball, which is only a month away. The Trojans will now field one of the most talented teams in all of college football. Though the Trojans have the potential to compete on the national level, the jury is still out on whether Sarkisian can develop his acquired talent and transform that into on-field success on Saturdays.
I’m sure that while the coaches celebrated on signing day, they will get right back to that “Recruit 365” mentality to put together their 2015 recruiting class, which will be USC’s first full 25-man class in what seems like forever.

Freshman Rico Hoey and the USC men’s golf team are off to a solid start at the Amer Ari Invitational in Waikoloa, Hawaii — their second event of the spring season. At the end of yesterday’s first round, Hoey sat in second place on the individual leaderboard, while the No. 24 Trojans finished in third place as a team.

No. 4 Oklahoma State leads a deep field at the annual tournament, edging out unranked TCU by a single stroke. The Trojans are themselves just one stroke behind the Horned Frogs at 15-under. Also in contention is No. 18 Texas, which is tied with Auburn for fourth place. Three ranked Pac-12 teams, No. 9 Stanford, No. 14 Washington and No. 15 UCLA, each ended the first round well behind the leaders. USC head coach Chris Zambri was content with his team’s effort.
“We are pleased with our start,” Zambri said. “This is a very strong field. If we are going to win, we’ll need help from all.”
Hoey, who struggled in last week’s season-opening Arizona Intercollegiate after an excellent fall campaign, led his team with an impressive 7-under 65. The Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. native was seeded second for the Trojans, falling from the No. 1 slot after his disappointing performance in Tucson, Ariz. Senior Jeffrey Kang, who won this event in 2011, followed up Hoey with a strong 6-under 66 of his own. That score was good enough for a third-place tie, while junior Anthony Paolucci’s 4-under 68 kept him in the individual hunt as well.
Oregon’s Thomas Lim has a slight lead in the individual race, just a stroke in front of Hoey. All three Trojans figure to battle Lim, TCU’s Chelso Barrett and Oklahoma State’s Ian Davis and Wyndham Clark for the top spot as the tournament continues.
Though he was excited about the individual performances of Hoey, Kang and Paolucci, Zambri knows the rest of his team must improve to win the tournament.
“We had three guys play very well,” he said. “We are looking for some help from the four and five guys in our lineup.”
Senior Ramsey Sahyoun and freshman Danny Ochoa both turned in over-par scores.
Action resumes early tomorrow morning at the Waikoloa Kings’ Course and will continue through the weekend. Results can be followed live at golfstat.com.

The USC men’s basketball team will look to avenge its first conference loss of the season, as well as bounce back from its current three-game skid, when they host UCLA at the Galen Center on Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
Big man on campus · Senior center Omar Oraby is the only Trojan to have started every game this season, but saw limited time in last month’s battle against the Bruins after sustaining an injury and later fouling out. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
USC (10-12, 1-8 Pac-12) is coming off a pair of losses over the weekend. The Trojans suffered a 76-75 overtime loss to Oregon State (13-8, 6-4), Jan. 30 and a 78-66 loss to Oregon (15-6, 3-6) on Feb. 1. Junior guard Byron Wesley led the Trojans with a combined 42 points, but USC remains at the bottom of the Pac-12.
“We had a very frustrating few weeks,” said USC head coach Andy Enfield. “This league is very good top to bottom and I’m very proud of our players. They’ve had great attitudes and they’ve been very enthusiastic and they came out and played that way tonight.”
Wesley is averaging 16.9 points and 6.8 rebounds per game to lead USC in both categories. Senior center Omar Oraby is second on the team with 6.5 rebounds per game. Senior guards J.T. Terrell and Pe’Shon Howard are the other two Trojans scoring in double-digits, with 10.4 and 10.3 points per game, respectively. Howard also leads the team with 4.1 assists per game.
“We just need to stay consistent,” Wesley said. “Look at the film, grow from that, see our flaws, see what we did well, and continue to practice hard and prepare like we’ve been preparing.”
UCLA (17-5, 6-3) split its two games against the Oregon teams last week, picking up a 70-68 win over the Ducks, but falling 71-67 to the Beavers.
The Bruins are paced by Jordan Adams, who leads the team with 16.8 points per game and is second on the team with 5.5 rebounds per game. Kyle Anderson is averaging 15.1 points, 8.7 rebounds and 6.6 assists per game, leading the team in the latter two categories.
The last match between the two schools was on Jan. 5, when the Bruins scored a season-high 107 points en route to a 107-73 win. It was the third game of the season where the Bruins scored more than 100 points, and the most points they’ve scored against the Trojans since another 107-point outburst in 1966.
Wesley led the Trojans with 21 points and nine rebounds, Terrell added 14 points off the bench and freshman guard Julian Jacobs finished with 10 points, five assists, five rebounds and three steals.
Anderson led UCLA with 23 points and 12 rebounds, as three Bruins finished with 20 or more points. Adams finished with 21, while Bryce Alford added 20. UCLA shot 58 percent from the field, including 48 percent from three-point range, while the Trojans shot 42 percent and 26 percent from behind the arc.
The Bruins lead the all-time series 134-104 and have won five of the past six meetings against their archrival. That one loss came last January in Westwood.
“[We need to] just play more as a team and be focused,” said freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic.
After their match against the Bruins, the Trojans will remain at the Galen Center to take on Utah (14-7, 3-6) on Thursday, Feb. 13 at 7:30 p.m. and Colorado (17-6, 6-4) on Sunday, Feb. 16 at 5 p.m. The Utah game will be shown on the Pac-12 Networks, while the Colorado game will be broadcast on ESPNU.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety crime/incident summary between Tuesday, Feb. 4 and Thursday, Feb. 6.
Crimes against property
At 11:28 A.M on Feb. 4, an unknown suspect went into the Eileen and Kenneth T. Norris Dental Science Center and stole a dental instrument from a secured cabinet.
At 11:oo P.M. on Feb. 4, a USC staff member reported seeing two suspects cutting the generator’s electrical cords at the Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital Research Institute.  The suspects fled when they saw the staff member and they could not be found.
At 3:54 P.M. on Feb. 4,  a USC staff member crashed a USC tram into a pole at the old DMV, causing minimal damage to the tram.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 3:08 P.M. on Feb. 4,  two students in Trojan Hall were cited to Judicial Affairs after smoking marijuana in one of the dorm rooms.
At 11:44 P.M. on Feb. 5,  nine students were cited to Judicial Affairs after being caught smoking marijuana in a dorm room in Fluor Tower.
Correction
“Trojan Vision returns to USC” (Feb. 6) misattributed the quotes attributed to Harrison Merkt. They should have been attributed to Mandi Brooksbank.
The article also mentions a show called The Flagship, when in fact there is no such show.
The article fails to mention that students need to have taken CTPR-409 to join the station.
The article also incorrectly states that Mind Games is a “stage show,” not a game show.
 
The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Ernest J. Wilson III hosted an open forum with Robert Herjavec, president and CEO of the Herjavec Group, one of the “sharks” on ABC’s show Shark Tank and author of two books, Driven: How to Succeed in Business and Life and The Will to Win: Leading, Competing, Succeeding, Thursday afternoon in the Geoffrey Cowan Forum,
Shark bite · Shark Tank’s Robert Herjavec, CEO and president of the Herjavec Group, spoke to students about his ‘journey to success’ in the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism on Thursday. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
 
Only 75 seats were available and students began lining up close to two hours before doors opened.
The forum began with a slideshow from Herjavec, where he explained his life story as well as his journey to success. The presentation allowed Herjavec to give advice that he has learned throughout his life while cracking a joke every minute or two after.
Herjavec, the son of a factory worker who escaped from jail to bring his family to the United States, was the first person in his family to attend university. When Herjavec was in college, his goal was not to be rich, he just didn’t want to be poor.
“The number one reason why I am a little bit successful, and everyone else I have met is successful, is that ability to drive through failure, through objection, through all that crap that happens to you,” Herjavec said. “Because I will guarantee you, in life, you will fail far, far, far more than you will succeed.”
After the 35-minute presentation, the floor was opened to questions, which ranged from whether or not every startup needs an investor to succeed to how he keeps his energy so high all the time.
“However busy you think you are, you can do more,” he said.
Herjavec gave three basic rules for giving “the perfect pitch:” get their attention; be very careful about blowing things out of context and know the numbers.
Dean Wilson asked Herjavec the final question.
“Tell us the most useful thing about how to prioritize,” Wilson said.
Herjavec said the first step is to be very careful with the words you choose because no one is ever good enough to lie to his or her subconscious. The skill, however, is about being “the eye of the hurricane.”
“Effectiveness is about understanding the urgent from the truly important,” he said. “The ball has got to keep bouncing because the minute the ball stops bouncing, everything stops.”
Felipe Da Paz, a sophomore majoring in business administration, already has a startup company. Da Paz will be attending a pitch competition tomorrow.
“For me, it was really cool to learn about what [Herjavec] looks at when someone is pitching at him,” he said. “He was talking about getting [the investors’] attention, and I think it is very good to have that clear in your head. You must do something to really grasp their attention.”
Nahal Aghajani, a junior majoring in public relations, was the first person in line to see Herjavec speak.
“[I am] a big fan of the show,” Aghajani said.
She believes that Herjavec is the most knowledgeable and humble of the sharks.
“He told you that the point of a business isn’t about making money,” she said. “He does it for something bigger than himself, and if you are going to start a business, it has to be for something bigger than yourself.”

Fifteen vendors from all over Downtown Los Angeles gathered on USC’s McCarthy Quad Thursday afternoon for Taste of Downtown L.A.
To dine for · Ignoring the rain, students lined up at The Melt, one of the 15 Downtown Los Angeles vendors set up in McCarthy Quad Thursday afternoon during the Taste of Downtown L.A. event. – Uracha Chaiyapinunt | Daily Trojan
 
Put on by Program Board, the once-a-semester event allowed students to sample fare from popular restaurants in Los Angeles.
This semester, Program Board Public Relations Chair Taylor Wong and Program Board Special Events Assistant Director Denise Rockstroh worked hard to bring in vendors. As a result, the number of tents out on the quad doubled from last semester.
“Its a good way for restaurants to promote themselves, so they were all really willing to come,” Rockstroh said.
Several students are used to seeing vendors in McCarthy Quad each week, selling fresh fruit and other goods as part of Undergraduate Student Government and USC Hospitality’s Trojan Farmer’s Market. This week, however, students were excited for a new event on the quad.
Students braved the rain to get samples from the surrounding eateries.
There were many different foods to choose from, including a sandwich shop and Greek restaurant, as well as boba and tea businesses. Jack McGuinn, a freshman majoring in fine arts, said the variety of food was the event’s main attraction.
“There are so many options to choose from,” Mcguinn said. “It’s great to be able to sample all of these places without having to buy a full meal.”
His attitude toward the free samples seemed to resonate with everyone at the event, as the line for food tickets stretched from Bovard Auditorium to Leavey Library within the first 30 minutes.
“The food is all great, and being a college student, the term free is always attractive,” said Abby Widtfeldt, a freshman majoring in engineering, while sampling a grilled cheese from food truck The Melt.
The stream of students stayed relatively constant throughout the entirety of the event, only slowing down in the last half hour when the rain began.
Program Board normally anticipates around 2,500 students for the three-hour event Rockstroh said.
Program Board implemented a new campaign at this semester’s Taste of Downtown LA. Students who brought Tupperware with them had the opportunity to skip up to three lines and get their food faster, which cut down the number of plates and utensils used during the event.
“After we saw how many plates were wasted last semester, we came up with this idea and got it officially approved by the Environmental Student Assembly,” Wong said.
The ESA is the newest assembly of Program Board and is committed to eco-friendly practices on campus. Wong estimated that Program Board spent about $1,000 on plates and utensils last semester. Because of the success of this year’s Tupperware incentive, Program Board was looking forward to continuing the campaign in future years.
“The Tupperware works out really well for everyone,” said Matt Kaufman, a sophomore majoring in policy, planning and development. “I get to skip lines and USC conserves waste, so it’s really a win-win.”
In the future, Rockstroh and Wong are excited to continue offering students this opportunity and they plan on expanding the event to fill the quad with vendors. Both are optimistic about the future and pleased with this semester’s turnout.
“We’re really proud,” Wong said. “And we are already starting to plan for fall.”

Upon hearing the story of the men and women working in the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives sections throughout World War II — aka the Monuments Men — who were fighting to reclaim art that had been stolen by the Nazis, I asked myself a series of “what if” questions.
Search and Rescue · George Clooney’s The Monuments Men, adapted from the book by Robert M. Edsel, tells the story of American soldiers on a mission to recover fine artwork stolen by the Nazis during World War II. – Photo courtesy of the Huffington Post
What if the Nazis had succeeded in building a super museum, the Führermuseum, and destroyed all “degenerate” art? What if they had burned modern works by the thousands, including but not limited to German expressionist, cubist and impressionist pieces? What if the millions of works that they stole had never been recovered? Most importantly, what if the Monuments Men hadn’t risked their lives to save the thousands of pieces of artworks that they did?
It might seem a bit pointless to ask these types of questions. Perhaps it’s better to focus on what exists today. But I can’t help but wonder what the art world would have been like had any of those things become a reality.
Art mirrors culture. It reflects who we are as a society at any specific moment in time. How would we understand our past if the thousands of works the Nazis had in their possession had been destroyed?
James Cuno, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, believes the art world would have survived.
“The world would be significantly lesser for the loss of such important and beautiful works of art,” Cuno wrote in an email. “That said, the surviving works of art from antiquity, say, must be a very small fraction of the total sum of works of art produced during that period of time. Thus, I am confident that the art world would have recovered if the Nazi-looted art had been lost.”
The art world constantly reinvents itself. It constantly produces new works. It surely would have been able to adapt. But because we know what exactly was at stake, I keep coming back to how great the loss would have been.
Hubert and Jan Van Eyck’s “Adoration of the Mystic Lamb,” aka the “Ghent Altarpiece,” was nearly lost to the cultural greed that fueled the Nazis. The altarpiece — made in 1432 — is considered one of the most important European works of art.
“If it had been lost, we would lose its beauty and poetry, and the evidence of the artist’s extraordinary mastery,” Cuno said.
The altarpiece is valued both for its expert artistry and religious significance. Religion, of course, is integral to art history: Many early works came as the result of commissions from the church or its patrons, and religion is the subject of some of the most famous works in the world —consider Michelangelo’s “The Last Judgment.”
I’m not a practicing Catholic, but I’m confirmed, and I recognize the importance of religious works for their artistic, academic and historical value. To me, the loss of the “Ghent Altarpiece” would be a loss of a significant piece of history.
Thankfully, the altarpiece was recovered, but I do wonder how its near-destruction has affected the way we view the piece: Has this work, and many others like it, taken on a richer meaning? Absolutely. I believe the “Ghent Altarpiece” is one of the most significant European works, in large part because it was almost lost to us.
The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History (George Clooney’s film adaptation The Monuments Men hits theaters today) by Robert M. Edsel details the recovery of these works of art. It opens with a quote from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, delivered March 17, 1941 at the dedication ceremony of the National Gallery of Art.
“Whatever these paintings may have been to men who looked at them a generation back — today they are not only works of art. Today they are the symbols of the human spirit, and of the world the freedom of the human spirit made … To accept this work today is to assert the purpose of the people of America that the freedom of the human spirit and human mind which has produced the world’s greatest art and all its science — shall not be utterly destroyed.”
Here, we see that context is everything. The works stolen and reclaimed take on new meaning. As Roosevelt said, they are more than works of art. Now, they are a source of national pride.
The risk paid off and artworks were recovered, so efforts made to save these works feel worth it. But what drove the Monuments Men to go to such extremes to preserve these works of art? Cuno has a theory.
“They must have been startled by the scale of the looting and the simple fact that the works of art they found belonged to other people and institutions,” Cuno said. “Their response to save and return the works of art to their rightful owners was honorable.”
Honorable, without a doubt, but I’m not entirely sure that I would have put my life on the line for art. And yet, I can’t imagine a world without these works either because I consider art to be that important.
“Art heightens our sensitivity to the beautiful, fragile and strange,” Cuno said. “It broadens our world and encourages our humility.”
Perhaps this is how the Monuments Men felt, and this is what drove them to do what they did. Whatever the reason, to me, the story of the Monuments Men comes down to a single, driving question: Why does art matter?
Yes, it’s a very loaded question and can’t be answered in a single column — perhaps I’ve bitten off more than I can chew — but the Monuments Men infiltrated the war because art is so significant.
My best answer is that art reflects culture, and is culture in and of itself. It is a mirror that reflects society, elicits feelings and creates experiences in its own right. When I think about the Monuments Men, it becomes more than just a story about preserving art. Rather, it is a story about preserving society.
That being said, I feel as though I better understand the motivations of the men and women fighting to save history — and to save art.

What do Muse, The Neighborhood, Adele, Coldplay and The Beatles all have in common? At first glance, not much — these bands span musical genres and decades. Yet the Vitamin String Quartet succeeded in melding the music of these five bands in its concert at The Troubadour on Wednesday.
The Los Angeles-based group has put its signature spin on countless songs since its debut in 1999. The Vitamin String Quartet has released more than 280 tribute albums, including quirky wedding compilation albums and annual covers of the year’s greatest hits. Despite its incredible pace of album releases, VSQ has shown that it produces quality arrangements. The group’s 2002 album Exit … Stage Right: String Quartet Tribute to Rush received a Grammy nomination. In addition, the quartet included original songs on its 2009 album, Vitamin String Quartet: Per_Versions.
VSQ has a devoted following and growing audience. Radio station WWHK in Concord, N.H. played their music 24 hours a day during the spring and summer of 2012. Instead of playing live concerts, the band prefers to perform behind the scenes. VSQ contributed to Danny Elfman’s reprisal of the Nightmare Before Christmas score in 2008. The band’s songs have also been used in television, on So You Think You Can Dance, Vampire Diaries, Gossip Girl and others. In 2011, the band was featured on MTV Unplugged, playing “Kings and Queens” in tribute to 30 Seconds to Mars.
The Vitamin String Quartet has proven itself to be as adaptable as it is innovative. One of the band’s greatest strengths is its ability to capture the essence of songs. VSQ’s arrangements are not simple distillations of other band’s songs; they deserve to be enjoyed in their own right. The musicians shape the pre-existing music into something wholly recognizable yet entirely fresh. They refocus the song, substituting melody and harmony for lyrics, and using strings to mimic other instruments and the result is sublime.
The concert opened with a single eerie spotlight on an empty stage. One by one, the members of Vitamin String Quartet filled the stage. As the name implies, VSQ is a string quartet in the classical sense, consisting of two violins, one viola and one cello. These musicians, however, do not adhere to stodgy classical principals.
VSQ opened with one of its most popular songs, “Clocks,” from the String Quartet Tribute to Coldplay album. This rhythmic rendition featured pizzicato, or string plucking, which sounds similar to ticking clocks. Even though traditional orchestras incorporate pizzicato, Vitamin String Quartet combines it with other orchestral techniques to produce unexpected sounds. The musicians strum, slide and slap their instruments, and also incorporate claps, snaps and stomps. This break from tradition added to the relaxed atmosphere at The Troubadour. The musicians played with unity — drawing from one another’s energy and musical cues as well as responding to audience requests and cheers.
Though Vitamin String Quartet did not formally announce all of its songs, it was not difficult to recognize popular tunes, such as “Hallelujah” by Paramore and “Dream On” by Aerosmith. This informal aspect could be seen as an annoyance to people who are unfamiliar with the string quartet but the audience seemed to consist of fervent VSQ fans, so this was not an issue. In the future, however, it could be helpful for the band to post or announce a setlist so that audience members can follow along more easily.
VSQ maintained a casual atmosphere; the musicians moved to the music and encouraged the audience to sway and clap along. The strings provided a colorful soundscape that made lyrics unnecessary. Only after repeated prompting did concert-goers sing along to VSQ’s cover of Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody.” This song was one of the most dynamic of the night and used strobe lights to emphasize abrupt changes in mood. “Bohemian Rhapsody” also featured an extended viola solo and sweeping violin scales.
Another standout was “Sweater Weather” from VSQ Performs the Hits of 2013 Vol. 1. This laid-back tune incorporated a bubbly sounding pizzicato section and enchanting harmonies. VSQ’s reinvention of The Neighborhood’s popular song made listeners consider the melodic undercurrent of this tune and appreciate the versatility of the original. “Sweater Weather” proved to be one of the night’s most well-received songs, and when the audience demanded an encore, VSQ gave a second performance.
The show highlighted the band’s versatility; they deftly switched from a sultry rendition of Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep” to the more introspective “Across the Universe” by The Beatles. This concert was a stellar introduction, or re-introduction, to the Vitamin String Quartet’s unique flair and leaves listeners eagerly anticipating the quartet’s next album.

CVS Caremark, one of the largest drugstore chains in the nation, announced Wednesday that it would halt its sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products by October in an attempt to live up to its role as one of the leading healthcare providers in country, according to The New York Times. As well-intentioned as this move is, however, it is unlikely to make any significant impact on the already dwindling favorability of cigarettes nationwide.
Design by Julien Nicolai
 
The company’s decision to stop selling cigarettes has been lauded by many as a critical first step in substantially cutting smoking rates. The anti-smoking sentiment that is trying to be achieved, however, isn’t exactly new. Eighty-two percent of Americans already view smoking as very harmful, according to Gallup. The fact that smoking has serious health consequences is universally acknowledged by smokers and nonsmokers alike. Though CVS’ decision might garner the support of those who are already opposed to smoking or indifferent to it, it’s unlikely that the ban will have much of an effect on the regular smoker aside from the potential inconvenience of having to shop for cigarettes elsewhere.
It is this lack of convenience that CVS competitors will likely take advantage of. Though many hope that CVS will pressure other large pharmacies to remove tobacco products from their stores, it is unlikely that these companies won’t take advantage of the opportunity to increase sales. CVS’ decision is estimated to curb its sales by approximately $2 billion — a minor dent in its overall profits of approximately $123 billion. But what’s considered a small profit cut to CVS might not be the case for other companies.
In fact, CVS’ decision to discontinue its sale of tobacco will only incentivize smokers to take their business elsewhere. The fact of the matter is that cigarettes are an inelastic good — they’re primarily purchased by consumers who have an addiction to nicotine. CVS’ decision to stop selling tobacco products won’t suddenly rid its consumers of their addiction. Rather, it’ll only spur them to shop somewhere else. To treat tobacco dependency like a stigma that can be cured by cutting off the supply isn’t just naive, but also a clear misunderstanding of addiction itself.
Ultimately, the exclusion of cigarettes from stores is a trend that has already been in effect in cities such as San Francisco and Boston, and one that will likely be incorporated in other cities in the future. But to think that such a decision will discourage individuals from an already unpopular practice is improbable. Regardless of CVS’ good intentions, its ultimate goal of curbing smoking is unlikely to make a serious impact.

The state should be concerned. Vast amounts of taxes come from tobacco users. Fewer smokers and lower sales mean the state will have to look elsewhere for its insatiable appetite for tax dollars.
CVS stopping the sale of tobacco products will not make much of a difference at all. With their prices typically .75 to 1.50 higher then most corner drug stores or the local 7-11 the majority of smokers, myself included, would never buy smokes from them in the first place. This will actually do nothing to curb smoking at all.

CVS Caremark announced Wednesday that it will stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products by Oct. 1. The decision shows CVS’ corporate courage that prompts the growing need for drugstores to step up as today’s healthcare providers — institutions that are wholeheartedly committed to health, not just finances.
Design by Julien Nicolai
 
Having cigarettes available in pharmacies has long been a paradox, but apparently one that wasn’t obvious enough. As pharmacies retool themselves as key players under President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, however, the perplexing contradiction has been brought to light. In a place where pharmacists counsel about wellness products and clinicians do outreach, the health agenda does not mesh well at all with the sale of tobacco products that bring about poor health.
This decision to ban tobacco is projected to cost the company $2 billion in sales, according to The New York Times. In the grand scheme of things, however, this loss is minimal considering the $123 billion worth of sales in 2012 for CVS. After all, the purpose of a pharmacy store — providing customers with care — should be the ultimate goal. It is the health of a patient that is bestowed on the company as a healthcare provider and vendor of medicine.
As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports, smoking is today’s leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Though only 18 percent of U.S. adults smoke, according to the American Lung Association, the addiction still kills more than 392,000 Americans each year. It might be a while before the numbers begin to decline, but this is a major first step in the right direction. Not only is it another sign of CVS transforming into more of a healthcare provider than a retail business, but hopefully it will make clinics more appealing as the ACA comes into full effect. With the ban, CVS will now be able to strike deals with more traditional healthcare providers as a pharmacy that strives to reduce smoking rates among patients.
In hopes of truly making a change, CVS has succeeded with regard to closing off the gateway to smoking addiction. Though this might not immediately lead to regular smokers calling it quits, the fact that such a giant in the drugstore industry is banning cigarettes should be enough to urge other retailers to follow suit.
Making cigarettes less accessible will surely have an effect on smoking, particularly among young adults. Pharmacies and mass retailers must recognize their responsibility as promoters of better health and their commitment to health care, just as CVS has. As Steven Schroeder, director of the Smoking Cessation Leadership Center at the University of California, San Francisco, said, “We’re a long way from the endgame.” Yet at the same time, it’s a significant step closer.

“People always leave,” were the famous words of One Tree Hill’s Peyton Sawyer. But the problem with TV shows isn’t that actor’s leave — it’s that shows try to bring them back.
Wednesday  Marked the 200th episode of CBS’s Criminal Minds which also saw the return of Paget Brewster’s Emily Prentiss. From the moment Brewster announced her departure at the end of the show’s seventh season, both she and executive producer Erica Messer seemed open to the idea of bringing her back for a future guest spot.
But does bringing back departed characters give audiences a chance to appreciate the dynamics of how a show once was, or does it throw salt in old wounds and leave viewers unsatisfied?
When Chad Michael Murray famously returned to the set of One Tree Hill in its final season after departing the show three years earlier, he was given just a single scene that showed little interaction with his former co-stars. The guest spot was useless. Viewers got little explanation for what Murray’s Lucas Scott had been doing the past three years and why his wife Peyton (Hilarie Burton) hadn’t shown up to her best friend Brooke’s wedding, or even phoned when she had a baby.
In that three-year period, One Tree Hill had managed to reinvent itself. With the departure of Lucas and Peyton — one of the show’s central couples — the series brought various new characters into the fold and largely shifted its focus onto other relationships. Lucas’ return served to do no more than remind viewers he had left and prove his once dramatic and comedic dynamic with his former colleague was only a shadow of what it once was.
The West Wing saw slightly greater success when it welcomed former White House communications advisor Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe) back into the fold for the series’ final two episodes. Lowe didn’t have too many scenes but the circumstances of his return to Washington made sense. The White House was transitioning to a new president and newly named Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford) wanted a friend and trusted colleague by his side. With Sam’s reintroduction, viewers sensed that the once young fresh-faced staff of the Bartlet presidency were now all grown up and ready to tackle new jobs. Sam’s return was logical, yet marginalized enough that it did not interfere with the dynamic created on the show in three seasons since his departure.
So just how did Criminal Minds make room for Prentiss at the BAU for one more night?
Putting other characters in peril seems to be a popular way to reintroduce old characters. Lucas’ return to Tree Hill — or more specifically just the Tree Hill airport — came on the heels of his brother’s kidnapping. Prentiss’ return came after the kidnapping for another former colleague and friend, JJ (A.J. Cook).
In interviews about the 200th episode, Brewster suggested that her role would be fairly large because Prentiss would have information about JJ that many other characters would not. At its core, the 200th episode was about JJ, but Prentiss was given the privilege of the opening voiceover. Though she didn’t appear until 15 minutes in, the speed with which she rushed to aid her old team suggested she was still a part of the BAU family.
It worked in Brewster’s favor that she left the show on good terms with her casemates and the audience, all of whom knew about her departure ahead of time. Likely not all departed characters would receive such a warm welcome on their old stomping grounds.
Recently fans were shocked to learn that Cote de Pablo, who played NCIS female lead Ziva David, would only appear in one episode of the CBS hit’s 11th season. Though fans have been adamant in requesting Ziva’s return, co-star David McCallum recently told DigitalSpy of his “frustration and anger that someone should just walk out on us,” adding, “I just don’t understand how a leading lady in a show that’s worldwide, who ostensibly wants to have a career as an actress, suddenly walks away from such a gem and just vanishes a couple of days before we start production.”
It seems there is a specific set of conditions under which an actor can reasonably leave a show and be invited back. Brewster’s situation is unique. She was forced to leave the show once before, amid budget cuts halfway through season six, but protests from the audience and cast members brought her back for season seven.
With Prentiss’ season seven departure, the show established a new dynamic, bringing in Alex Blake (Jeanne Tripplehorn) as a profiler, but the 200th episode cleverly avoided disturbing that new rhythm through use of flashbacks.
Criminal Minds was smart and realistic in bringing Brewster back. Some of her scenes in the episode were shot on a plane, because logically she could not have traveled from London to D.C. with lightning speed. The only time viewers saw Prentiss with her entire former team came during the celebration of JJ’s return at the end of the episode. The writers did not try to hide the changed dynamics of the team or marginalize Blake. Rather, Blake recognized it was nice to finally put a face to the name she had heard so much about.
But all good things must come to an end and Hotch (Thomas Gibson), ended the episode by asking Prentiss the question on everyones mind: “Emily how much longer do we have you?”  When she replied, “Six hours,” Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) promptly said it was too soon for her to leave, echoing audience sentiment.
Prentiss’ visit wasn’t perfect. We didn’t get to see much of the witty banter with her male counterparts that was quintessential to her time on the show, but in the context of the episode her presence worked. Though her departure will surely widen the hole in the hearts of fans already saddened when she left the first two times, it is worth that little bit of pain for a visit done right.
Ever the wise man, Rossi (Joe Mantegna) reminded the viewers and the team they although Prentiss visit might’ve been short, “It was more than we had yesterday.”
