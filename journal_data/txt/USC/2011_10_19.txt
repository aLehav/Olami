Though sea levels off the coast of California have not risen significantly in 30 years, immediate action is required to stem the effects of global climate change, experts said Wednesday.

Leaders in biology, sociology, journalism and public policy came together at Wednesday’s “Climate Change in Southern California Coastal Region: Science’s Issues and Societal Implications” to discuss what needs to be done to address the issues.
Reinhard Flick, an oceanographer from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, began the discussion with an explanation of sea level rise, which he said would impact Southern California more directly than other areas because of the topography of the coast. Though Flick said a rising sea level will not directly affect Southern California right away, the sea level is a pressing concern because it worsens other environmental issues like erosion and flooding.
According to Flick, there has not been any significant sea level rise off the coast of California for more than 30 years. Instead, a global rising sea level has disproportionately affected the western Pacific coastlines of Asia because of wind stress patterns.
Flick warned this reprieve of sea level rise might soon come to an end, as scientists predict a change in the direction of wind patterns. This would ultimately indicate ocean levels will rise more quickly.
Policies implemented because of climate change also dominated the conversation,
Daniel Mazmanian, director of the USC Judith and John Bedrosian center on Governance and the Public Enterprise, discussed policy initiatives like the Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32), which put the 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal of California  into law.
Though California’s policies have provided for the mitigation of issues related to climate change, “we don’t really have a strategy for adaptation in California,” Mazmanian said.
He suggested that California create incentives to make policies more effective because average consumers, who do not easily change their behaviors, need motivation.
“We don’t have a logic focused on future concerns,” he said. “There is no really compelling ethical consideration that makes us feel responsible for issues in the future.”
Xiao Liu, a graduate student studying ocean science, said she found the panelists’ discussion of science and policy particularly informative.
“I’m a scientist, so I don’t get a lot of information from classes in terms of the policy,” Liu said. “I’m actually thinking about taking on a second degree in environmental policy, so this is a good start for me.”
Trent Boras, an undeclared freshman, said he was glad he came to the discussion.
“It’s really interesting to come here because you learn a bunch of new things,” Boras said. “You hear people ask questions that are very interesting and they kind of give you ideas of what you can do in the future to help slow down this action of global warming.”
The discussion was informative, said Nina Zhu, a senior majoring in business administration.
“I’m here for my GE class where we’re learning about humans and our environment, so this correlates with what we’re learning in class,” Zhu said. “It also brings in new ideas and perspectives into place.”
She said climate change deserves more attention.
“All we worry about is trying to get a job and the economy,” Zhu said. “We’re not realizing how important of an issue [climate change] is. It directly affects us, more so than how much money you’re making, because this is the environment. This is our future.”

After USC expanded its alternative spring break program this year, the program received 161 applicants by its deadline at 5 p.m. Tuesday.
The alternative spring break program added three more trips this year after student participation in the program increased in the past few years.
The alternative winter break program received 66 applications.

Alternative spring break program added trips to Honduras, one to West Virginia and one to a mystery location this year, bringing the total number of  programs to seven domestic and three international trips.
The program offers students the opportunity to participate and coordinate different trips to volunteer for a variety of causes.
“One of my goals is to be able to offer more opportunities for students to go on these trips because we do get an abundance of applications,” said Joenique Rose, program manager for Alternative Breaks and Community Partners.
Rose said the Honduras trip was added earlier this year after a nonprofit organization approached her. Ten students will visit a small community to help coffee farmers.
“The idea is for students [to work] and [see] where the coffee farmers pick their coffee cherries, [help] them lay down foundations in some of their homes because a lot of them have dirt floors and [lay] some water pipes down for a well,” Rose said.
The program will give students opportunities to work with the village community and learn about the coffee industry.
“Students will be going into classrooms and doing English lessons,” Rose said. “They will be helping the whole family in their day to day life and see what this occupation does for their family.”
Ryan Rysyk, a senior majoring in psychology who has coordinated and participated in programs in previous years, said at first he participated in the program to visit a new location but ended up learning about the health system in Baltimore, Md.
“My freshman year I did not know much about [alternative breaks],” he said. “I was interested in seeing Baltimore when I first went, but it gave me the opportunity to actually see what was going on there.”
Students who go on the West Virginia trip will volunteer in the Appalachian region.
The program also debuted a new type of trip, in which students sign up without knowing where they will be sent. The trip will relate to juvenile justice and will be domestic.
“We have people apply out of interest rather than locations to see how many people are receptive,” Rysyk said. “It’s really the word of mouth from students who have participated and tell their friends that increases the number of people who apply every year.”
The alternative break program also reinstated a winter trip to Thailand, which was canceled two years ago because of security issues in the country.
The winter trip to Thailand started in 2005, in response to the 2004 tsunami, and was the first alternative winter break the Volunteer Center facilitated.
This year Lindsey Poole, a junior majoring in communication, will coordinate the trip to Thailand. She said she has received 70 applications for the trip.
She previously went on an alternative winter break trip to Belize.
“It was a great experience to step out of my comfort zone and get to know other Trojans that I would’ve not met otherwise,” Poole said. “It just gave me a greater insight to different people and how their lifestyles are so different depending on their culture. I left with a broader perspective.”
Jessie Friedmann, a sophomore majoring in policy, planning and development, is coordinating a trip for the first time this year.
Her group will be going to Orcas Island in Washington, where it will clean up streams and deal with other pertinent environmental issues.
Friedmann said some students would rather relax than volunteer during spring break.
“Spring break, you want to relax and go somewhere sunny,” Friedmann said. “Probably the idea of going to Seattle where it’s 50 degrees and raining isn’t their first choice.”
Friedmann said, however, alternative break programs are rewarding enough to be worth it.
“All of them take you out of Los Angeles and when you’re at USC you’re in a bubble,” she said. “[It’s] getting a perspective out of USC and dealing with issues you don’t see at USC and bringing back that experience.”
Ellen, I am in total support of your lifestyle choices.  No judgements from me or my bros!
and you Fratboy5, may need to learn how to spell ‘capital”, your spelling is of another context usage of the word that is incorrect. So when you made snide comments, your misspelling will surely show the source as not the brightest.
I just read that Honduras is the murder capitol of the World.   Be sure and bring lots of sunscreen.

More than 8.5 million California residents, including USC students, faculty and staff, are expected to drop, cover and hold at 10:20 a.m. today as part of the largest earthquake drill in state history.
The number of anticipated participants in the event indicates an increased awareness of earthquakes and their potential damage, said Mark Benthien, director of communication, education and outreach at the Southern California Earthquake Center.
“This drill will be unique in that so many people will be doing it as a result of informed decision making considering the chances of an earthquake,” Benthien said.
The Great California Shakeout aims to educate participants on what to do when an earthquake occurs and help test and prepare emergency response teams. USC students are encouraged to take part in the drill.
The Great California Shakeout started in 2008 when scientists said Southern California was long overdue for a 9.5-magnitude earthquake, similar to the 9.5-magnitude Great Chilean Earthquake of 1960.
“Research over many decades has confirmed we are long overdue for a big [earthquake] so this drill is more relevant than ever,” Benthien said.  “The nature of the landscape that [has] earthquake faults means we wont have a 10.0 — that is impossible, but we can have one that is close.”
USC is located directly above an earthquake fault. The fault, however, only reacts every 500 years according to Benthien.
Navid Nastar, an adjunct assistant professor of civil and structural engineering, said most USC buildings have been designed or retrofitted to satisfy the requirements of applicable building codes.
“The majority of the buildings [at USC] are expected to stay relatively life-safe in the event of a large and unlikely earthquake,” Nastar said.
He said one of the most important things to remember during an earthquake is to remain calm and to stay indoors because the exteriors of buildings normally sustain the most damage.
“The worst thing to do is to panic and rush for exits [because] the falling objects from the façade of a building can be extremely dangerous.” Nastar said.
In the event of an earthquake, USC Fire, Safety and Emergency Planning will station a Building Emergency Response team in each building to ensure the safety of people inside, according to Bill Regensburger, director of USC Fire, Safety and Emergency Planning.
Mike Mahbobian, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said he has mixed feelings about the drill.
“It’s a good way to improve earthquake preparedness, even though most people are likely to respond to their instincts rather than drill instructions,” Mahbobian said.

According to ESPNLosAngeles.com, sources close to J.T. Terrell, former Wake Forest guard, confirmed on Wednesday the 19-year-old has verbally committed to transfer to USC after spending his freshman year at Wake Forest University.
Ranked in the ESPNU Top 50 for the class of 2010, Terrell, a 6-foot-3 guard, started 18 of 32 games his freshman year, averaging 11.1 points and 1.6 assists.
He shot 37 percent from the field and 36 percent from the 3-point line. Terrell also ranked fifth among the Atlantic Coast Conference freshman in scoring.
Terrell came to USC on an official recruiting visit last weekend and was hosted by former Wake Forest forward and USC transfer Ari Stewart. Terrell plans to begin play for the Trojans during the 2012-2013 season.
Terrell, the second-leading scorer for Wake Forest his freshman year, recently withdrew from the school after he was arrested on charges of driving while impaired and driving under the influence in Winston-Salem, N.C., near the Wake Forest campus.
The DUI charges were dropped after Terrell pled guilty to the charge of DWI. He will serve a 60-day jail sentence after a year-long probation. This will not, however, affect his ability to play for USC in the 2012-2013 season.
Terrell is spending his sophomore season at Peninsula Junior College in Port Angeles, Wash., and will officially sign to USC on Nov. 9, the first day of the early signing period, according to sources.
Looks like Wake Forest is becoming a farm team of misfits for the Trojan basketball program. No word about
this player’s academic standing in the article. How about one top recruit from high school selecting USC to play
basketball. Although most likely one and done let’s see if O’neill is able to sign Muhammad from Las Vegas to
show his ability to bring someone here that is highly ranked.

Coming into the International Tennis Association Southwest Regional Championships in Malibu, Calif., members of the No. 1 USC men’s tennis have one goal in mind: to qualify for the ITA National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships next month.
The singles and doubles champions of the five-day regional competition will earn berths to the prestigious indoor tournament in Flushing, N.Y.
Unstoppable · Sophomore Emilio Gomez, who won the Battle in the Bay Classic singles title, holds an 8-0 record in singles play this year. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
USC sends sophomores No. 15 Ray Sarmiento, No. 66 Emilio Gomez, Corey Smith and freshmen Eric Johnson, Jonny Wang and Yannick Hanfmann to participate in the 128-player draw. Sarmiento, Gomez and Hanfmann are seeded No. 2, No. 8 and No. 12, respectively, and will have byes in the first round.
No. 16 senior Daniel Nguyen, who already earned a bid to Flushing by reaching the quarterfinals in the ITA All-Americans Championship in Tulsa, Okla., earlier this month, will not participate in the singles draw.
Three doubles teams will also represent USC in a 64-team draw. Nguyen and Hanfmann, seeded No. 4, will pair up alongside Gomez and Sarmiento, seeded No. 7, and Johnson and Wang.
The tournament will feature some of the top players from the Southwest region of the country, including Pepperdine’s No. 10 junior Sebastian Fanselow, who defeated Sarmiento in the quarterfinals and Nguyen in the finals of ITA Regionals last year. Because Fanselow holds the No. 1 seed in the tournament, Sarmiento will not face Fanselow unless both players advance to the finals.
“If I face [Fanselow], I want to do my best and try to get revenge for Nguyen and me,” Sarmiento said.
USC coach Peter Smith, on the other hand, hopes his players spend more of the tournament concentrating on victory rather than vengeance.
“You don’t want to hold too much of a grudge because you got to focus on what you need to do, not on who you’re beating,” Smith said. “Having said that, I hope they kick [Fanselow’s] butt.”
Gomez, fresh off a singles championship performance at the Battle in the Bay Classic in San Francisco earlier this week, believes he will be ready for a shot at a second singles title this fall.
“It’s always good to win a tournament,” Gomez said. “It gives you a lot of confidence, and I think I’m going to have a good week at Malibu. I have to be ready mentally and physically, and my game has to be at a top level.”
Despite the players’ recent successes in fall tournaments, injuries have started to plague the team.
Sophomore Michael Grant, who took home the consolation singles title at the ITA Regionals last year, will have wrist surgery today, instead of joining the team in Malibu.
Sarmiento has also dealt with shoulder problems.
Fatigue is a cause of concern amid the injuries and numerous fall tournaments, but Smith believes having such a close tournament to USC will benefit the team.
“I think Malibu is a wonderful place to visit,” Smith said. “[The regionals] are just good for these guys — just good match experience to get them better.”
The players agree, and they believe every member of the team has a chance at standing atop the bracket in Malibu.
“It’s going to be a really tough tournament,” Hanfmann said. “But we practiced a lot, and I think we should be good.”

With both teams at relative low points, the bad blood in the rivalry doesn’t quite boil like it used to (at least on the West Coast, anyway — South Bend might be a different story).
Sure, the game will receive plenty of attention with its primetime spot on NBC, and the coverage of the rivalry would have you believe it’s as intense as it has ever been.
But that’s not the case.
Even USC Athletic Director Pat Haden, who you’d expect to sing out about the majesty and tradition of the game, realizes the stakes are unusually low.
“[To the kids], if you talk to them, this is just another game in a series of 12,” Haden told ESPN this week. “I think all of us — you, me, the old-timers — feel differently than the players do.”
It’s a little disheartening to take stock of the declining value of this once-historic matchup, and as fans continue to come to grips with the reality, they’re going to look for a scapegoat.
In Kelly’s case, the blow is somewhat softened by general mediocrity among the Fighting Irish’s coaches since Lou Holtz moved out. In fact, Charlie Weis’ disappointing tenure preceding Kelly had most calling for any type of change.
And Kelly helped his case by going into the Los Angeles Coliseum last November and downing the Trojans in the rain to end an eight-year USC winning streak — with a little help from a slippery field and then-senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson’s cleats.
But for the most part, these coaches are subject to widespread scrutiny and expected to right their respective ships, returning them to the glory they once shared.
In Kiffin’s case, the pressure has to be palpable.
Losing to Notre Dame was not a good mark on Kiffin’s first season at USC, especially for a guy who just can’t seem to do right by anybody. If he goes for it on fourth down twice in a game, converting one, few are going to remember the make. Everyone’s going to remember the failure and chide his decision-making for the next week. Even I’m guilty of it.
College coaches have to deal with hopelessly irrational critics, and these two in particular deal with masses that have sky-high standards and paper-thin leniency.
It might be fair to evaluate these coaches based solely on their performance, but to judge them based on how they stack up to predecessors and how well they preserve a legacy?
That’s just wrong.
Kiffin is not Pete Carroll. Kelly is not Holtz. The 2011 Trojans are not the 2004 Trojans, and the 2011 Irish aren’t the 1988 Irish.
There’s no way to compare teams across these eras when competition, recruiting, motivation, training and so many other variables are just that — variables.
Let them shape their own programs and get off their backs about the past.
For whatever reason we tend to concentrate the blame on the one person who has absolutely no reason to do any less than his best — when you work for one of these programs, you tend to like your job.
We act like Kiffin and Kelly walk out on the field every week, pull off their blindfolds and coach a game. They’ve studied the film. They’ve evaluated the players. They’ve made painstaking preparations.
But all they hear is how they aren’t as good as the people who did it at an elite level before them.
Maybe it is a matter of talent — and not just preparation — that makes a good coach.
Maybe Kiffin isn’t as talented as Carroll, and maybe Kelly isn’t as talented as Holtz.
But why should a lower level of talent give fans an excuse to vilify these figures?
It’s wrong to trash a player just because he doesn’t excel at the level we want. It’s widely done, but it’s wrong.
Often players’ success or failure is largely dependent on how they fared in the genetic lottery. The same goes for coaches.
So if we’re going to continue to treat Kiffin and Kelly as unfairly as we do now, let’s call this game what it really is.
The Scapegoat Bowl.

Wow!  USC fans have an inflated opinion of who they are.  USC was lucky to even be in last year’s game as 4 unforced errors by a FR QB making his first road start accounted for all 16 of USC’s points.  USC got handled on both lines of scrimmage.  Expect more of the same up front again this year.  USC’s only chance is ND turning the ball over again.  If both teams bring their A game, ND wins by 2 TDs.
Pat Haden is playing the expectations game, trying to lower them as much as possible.  He knews the Trojans are probably in for trouble in South Bend, and he wants to lessen the impact as much as possible.  Haden should check NBC’s tv ratings after the game and then re-evaluate his position.
Pat Haden is sadly; truly mistaken. And foolishly so. I can tell you this for certain. There are over 150,000 troops between Iraq and Afghanistan who are very heated about this game. Even some of the Iraqi troops  see it. They sense the ‘urgency.’ And they too wish to watch the game. My buds tell me fans from NYC to LA are abuzz..
Sadly Mr Haden, a once prolific player and fine sports announcer (always fair and balanced to both squads) became lost in the din of history. This is big. Ask any fan of either team “If you could lay a beating on any team of your choosing; whom would that be?” They wouuld all identify the two playing Saturday night, Notre Dame and USC. Ask the players who’s ass do you want to torch on the schedule? And by the way, this is the greatest intersectional rivalry in history. Look at the numbers: 22 NC, most All Americans of any pair of schools, need I mention the 14 combined Heismans and on and on. No signifigance? Right. Even the soccer fans of Iraq see the signfiigance. Sadly Mr Haden and Mr ‘Sadvitsky miss the point entirely.
This rivalry is HUUUUUUGE to us. Nothing is as big of a deal to trojan football, because they arent playing for anything. GO IRISH! BEAT TROJANS!

The last time USC faced Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., — Oct. 17, 2009 — it narrowly edged the Fighting Irish 34-27, marking its eighth straight victory over its longtime intersectional rival.
Tough task · Junior left tackle Matt Kalil and the USC offensive line will be faced with slowing down Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Fast-forward two years later, and only three starters from that team remain in junior quarterback Matt Barkley, senior middle linebacker Chris Galippo and redshirt junior defensive end Wes Horton.
As the team’s other 19 starters this year look to face off against the Irish in Notre Dame Stadium for the first time as starters, many look to leave their own legacies in a rivalry that dates back to 1926.
“I went there my redshirt freshman year when I didn’t play,” junior left tackle Matt Kalil said. “It’s a pretty historic stadium. The campus is just insane. It’s a great place to go play.”
USC ended up surviving a scare against Notre Dame in the final moments that day, as quarterback Jimmy Clausen fielded the ball at the USC four-yard line, but his pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph was knocked down by senior cornerback T.J. Bryant, who is redshirting this season.
But that was the last time USC, then coached by Pete Carroll, defeated Notre Dame.
Last season the Trojans’ watched the Irish snap their eight-game winning streak 20-16 at the Coliseum, a game that remains familiar for many current starters including Kalil.
But with both teams looking to crawl back into the top-25 after being ranked at the beginning of the season, Saturday’s contest carries other implications as well. Notre Dame, which began the year ranked No. 16 in the Associated Press top-25 poll, opened the season with consecutive losses at home to South Florida and at Michigan. But it has reeled off four straight wins, including most recently a 59-point outburst against Air Force.
“This is very important for them because they can’t lose anymore,” freshman linebacker Dion Bailey said. “For us, we’re out playing for respect, because no one really respects us.”
Though Bailey and others might like to gain more respect, particularly on the national level, beating Notre Dame would appear to be high up on a list of goals.
USC coach Lane Kiffin, however, opted to downplay the significance of the rivalry and all the hype surrounding the matchup.
“Because we’re so inexperienced and so young the last thing we want to do is build it up too much and you put too much pressure on them and they can’t handle that,” Kiffin said. “It isn’t about that. You don’t all of a sudden play different because of where you’re playing or who you’re playing. You still have to prepare extremely well in all phases of the game.”
—
Though much of the talk in recent weeks has centered on the defense, as well as the receiving core headlined by sophomore Robert Woods and freshman Marqise Lee, the Trojans’ offensive line has put together an impressive first half of the season of its own.
Through six games, USC has allowed just four sacks — tied for ninth best nationally with UCLA and Nevada.
“It just shows our attention to detail, listening to the little assignments,” Kalil said. “Basically winning our matchups, our one-on-ones.”
On the season, Notre Dame’s defense has recorded 15 sacks, highlighted by junior linebacker Manti Te’o, who leads the team with four sacks. Te’o originally committed to USC before signing with the Irish on signing day in February 2009.
“We’re just focusing and doing what we have to do as a team, get our assignments done and get after these guys,” Kalil said. “They’re a great team that could easily be 6-0 right now. Notre Dame has always been a great team and we certainly have a challenge ahead of us.”
—
Injuries could prove problematic for USC on Saturday, as its injury list continues to grow. Lee and senior tailback Marc Tyler, who each sustained shoulder injuries against California last week, will be game-time decisions, Kiffin said Wednesday.
Tyler suffered a dislocated shoulder at Cal, but Lee’s injury is said to be less serious.
“If there’s any way for [Lee] to play he’s going to try to play, so we have to really watch that,” Kiffin said.
With redshirt freshman cornerback Anthony Brown out for the season because of a broken ankle and redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris still sidelined with a shoulder injury, junior cornerback Isiah Wiley is expected to start Saturday in place of Brown. Freshman cornerback Ryan Henderson will serve as the team’s fourth cornerback, Kiffin announced.
As is always the case before a political debate, Haden is just trying to lower expectations.  It’s weird and more than a little sad.
Joey-It seems Daniel Savitsky and the venerable Pat Haden disagree. They think this s just another game! Now I read your comments from the SC players and know that Dan and Pat are in a fog. I’ve read the Irish players comments-they rate this as  the game of the year. My buds back home tell me the mouths are jawjacking from NYC to LA about this game. There are also well over 150,000 soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan itching for the greatest intersecional rivalry in college football to commence. Even some Iraqi soldiers are curious about what they call the ‘Big Match’ and expressed a desire to watch the game! (Some wondered why Ireland was at war with the Trojans!) I give credit to the Irish for not caving in earlier in the year. Now they are formidable to say the least. The Trojans have likewise faced adversity with courage and dignity. It just seems that the likes of Mark ‘The Oneonta Oaf’ May, Dan, and others love to take cheap shots at these two rivals; espcially the ‘Oaf.’
This will be a smack down classic of a game.

Before every USC football season, the athletic department plasters action photographs of the team’s premier players on a poster that advertises the season schedule.
Choosing the faces of the Trojans’ defense was presumably a bit thornier this season than in years past. Junior safety T.J. McDonald was a no-brainer considering in 2010 he led the team in tackles and notched three interceptions in the process of becoming an All-Pac-10 second team honoree. Choosing a second player to pair with him proved more difficult, however, but the department settled on senior defensive tackle Christian Tupou, who, despite being a three-year starter entering the season, sat out all of last year after tearing ligaments in his left knee in the 2010 spring game.
Baby steps · Junior safety T.J. McDonald is part of a secondary that allows opposing quarterbacks to throw for 10 more yards per game compared with last year. The rush defense, however, is allowing opposing tailbacks to run for 41 fewer rushing yards per game. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Though many players flashed with potential entering 2011, many needed to convert promise into consistent production. So far in 2011, the defensive results have been mixed.
“We had a good week of practice before Cal, and we hit two pretty good teams in Arizona and Arizona State and we didn’t play very well,” USC assistant coach Monte Kiffin said. “That combination obviously wasn’t very good. But we’ve challenged ourselves, and we’re gaining more confidence.”
Despite Kiffin’s optimism, the statistics do not indicate substantial improvement over last year’s defense that ranked 84th in overall defense and 109th in passing defense, surrendering nearly 260 passing yards per game and a 59.9 opposing quarterback completion percentage. This season’s pass defense is statistically worse, as USC’s opponents have averaged 271.7 passing yards per game with a 64.7 completion percentage. To USC’s credit, the defense is allowing 41 fewer rushing yards per game in 2011 (140.5 yards per game in 2010 compared to 99.5 yards per game in 2011).
What is most troubling about these statistics is they do not yet include three of the most potent offenses USC will face this season: Notre Dame, Stanford and Oregon. The Fighting Irish possess one of the most balanced attacks in the nation, ranking 29th in passing yards and 29th in rushing yards in the FBS and scoring 32.3 points per game.
“Notre Dame’s offense is really good,” Kiffin said. “You can’t be more balanced than they are. Last year they were more of a passing team, but they’ve developed a pretty good running team this year.”
Though the defensive numbers appear grizzly, there are certain developments that indicate USC might be due for a defensive resurgence. Certain USC players at critical positions who have battled bouts of inconsistency are beginning to show upticks in their play.
Redshirt junior defensive end Wes Horton, who registered only his second sack of the season in the waning minutes of the game against Cal, indicated pass rushing is predicated on confidence — something he might have regained against Cal.
“There were two or three games where I had a stretch with no sacks and confidence is huge when it comes to being a pass rusher,” Horton said. “When I did get that sack, it definitely boosted my confidence going into this week and knowing I can beat these tackles. I knew I could beat them before, but it gets me even more confident.”
The cornerback and safety positions opposite sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey and McDonald have proved almost patchwork in the last two seasons, as USC has shuffled numerous players through spots.
After all, teams will continue to shy away from Robey’s and McDonald’s territories and instead test their counterparts until other players in the secondary prove they possess similar playmaking ability.
Junior cornerback Isiah Wiley, after predominantly playing special teams this season, will assume the role of starting cornerback opposite Robey, at least until redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris returns from a shoulder injury. Listed at 6-foot-1, Wiley, who registered five tackles and one pass break-up against Cal, offers a more physical complement to the 5-foot-8 Robey, and will likely guard Notre Dame’s elite wide receiver Michael Floyd, who is listed at 6-foot-3.
“I thought I played well, but I could have done a couple of things better out there,” Wiley said. “Once I got more reps, I started reacting faster. Starting off, it was almost like a shock to my system because I’m used to playing with athletes who aren’t as good as me in junior college, but once I got here, all of the athletes are good.”
Junior safety Jawanza Starling, who has sometimes struggled with tackling — notably against Arizona State on 70-yard touchdown run by running back Cameron Marshall — was praised for what Kiffin termed his “best game as a Trojan” against Cal.
“I left one, if not two, interceptions out there,” Starling said. “I still got room to improve a bit. You can’t be satisfied with just one game. Every week I’ve gotten better at understanding my responsibilities and my role. Wherever I am, I still need to make plays. Not having any missed tackles was big for me.”
Despite looking impressive at times this year, the defense understands it needs to get better, starting  Saturday against the Fighting Irish.
“We have to make sure the younger guys realize the importance of this tradition and make sure that there is a sense of urgency this week,” Horton said. “It’s a huge game. [Notre Dame] beat us last year in the Coliseum. I think a lot of people were embarrassed after that game, so we have to go up and make plays this weekend.”

Art cannot be confined within a gallery or museum. It can, however, interact with the major icons and movements of popular culture and the music world.
This year’s gala at the Museum of Contemporary Art, for instance, will feature Debbie Harry, the frontwoman from the group Blondie, as the special performer. Though it might seem like a strange choice considering Harry was a much bigger star in the 1980s than she is today, she is actually the perfect fit, as she exemplifies just how musicians can transcend the music world and reach into the world of art.
Because MOCA and other museums will always want to feature the most exciting artists, especially considering the whopping minimum $2,500 price tag for the gala, it might seem the apperance of famous musicians is only meant to draw attention. Harry’s appearance at MOCA is significant not just for her performance and fame but for the fact that she is a significant part of music and art history.
Harry’s relationship with the art world started three decades ago. As a rock star, she was a perfect subject for another celebrity — Andy Warhol.
Warhol asked Harry to pose for him, which Harry admitted decades later she was more than happy to do. The result was a series of iconic portraits, including a pink 1980 silkscreen that recently sold for $5.9 million.
Harry’s interaction with the art world doesn’t stop there: In Blondie’s 1981 track “Rapture,” Harry raps Fab 5 Freddy told me everybody’s fly, a reference to her friendship with the iconic hip-hop and street art figure she met at a club. The music video also features appearances from Jean-Michel Basquiat and Lee Quinones, two equally iconic figures in the street art and graffiti movement.
Today, musicians still have close links to the art world. Devandra Banhart, Beck and Brazilian artist Caetano Veloso performed at last year’s gala.
But it was Lady Gaga’s performance at a MOCA gala two years ago that managed to fuse the creativity of so many different artists. Gaga premiered her tune “Speechless” on a piano painted by Damien Hirst, best known for his piece “The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living,” a full-length tiger shark in a container filled with formaldehyde. Given Hirst’s unconventional artwork, it only makes sense he and Gaga would find some common ground and collaborate.
But that’s not all. Architectural legend Frank Gehry joined in the fun by creating a complex hat for Gaga. Francesco Vezzoli, an Italian artist who designed the dancers’ costumes and who has photographed Gaga before, was also involved in the production.
Vezzoli also recently teamed up with feisty rapper Nicki Minaj for an upcoming issue of W magazine, in which Vezzoli placed Minaj in the traditional settings of Rococo, an art movement of the 18th century. Vezzoli counteracts Minaj’s usual depiction as a sexualized female rapper in scandalous clothing by portraying her in the famous portraits of the more conservative time period. The project allows Vezzoli to show off his skills in depicting Rococo scenes using a very famous subject and lets Minaj show a softer, more classical side.
Depicting a famous musician or having them play a piano you designed are powerful ways to get people to check out your work. Likewise, casually name-dropping an icon, such as Fab 5 Freddy or featuring artists such as Basquiat and Quinones in your video, only makes you that much cooler to music fans and art lovers.
Though Harry’s involvement in the art world started decades ago, the trend of musicians intrigued by the art world continues today. Creating explosive collaborations like these can benefit both parties. After all, the art and music worlds will continue to face new challenges as they evolve.
They might as well stick together while they do.

The theatrical production of To Kill A Mockingbird, an adaptation written by Christopher Sergel, directed by Michael Cooper and presented by the Sierra Madre Playhouse, maintains the original integrity of the book.
Though the novel was published more than 50 years ago, novelist Harper Lee’s message to see beyond appearances is as powerful as ever. Sergel and Cooper’s adaptation remains generally faithful to Lee’s storyline.
The novel thrives on endless details of small town life that present a grander picture by the story’s end. And the play adroitly translates the most important aspects of the novel to the stage.
The first page of Lee’s novel projected onto a large screen as audience members take to their seats. Once the lights dim, Maudie Atkinson (Diane Kelber), the Finches’ neighbor, walks out to remove the mock page and begin narrating the play.
Unlike the novel, which is told from the perspective of Scout Finch, the story’s young female protagonist, Maudie narrates the play through occasional asides to the audience. As opposed to Scout, who allowed readers to perceive the events from an innocent child’s perspective, Maudie’s narration is mature and pithy, giving the play a slightly different feel.
The stage was constructed to resemble the Finch family’s neighborhood in Maycomb, complete with Scout’s porch swing set and Boo Radley’s, Maycomb’s mysterious recluse, formidable front door. At times, the set seems too crowded to accommodate all of the actors at once, especially during the courtroom climax.  In a sense, however, this clutter succeeds in evoking the smothered feel of a sweltering Southern town rife with social and racial tension.
The chemistry between cast members gives credibility to their portrayal of a town whose citizens know each other all too well. Many of the performances stand out as fine representations of Lee’s complex characters, especially those of Atticus Finch (Christian Lebano) and May Ella Ewell (Lindsay Faye Wagner).
In what is arguably one of the most heated courtroom scenes, the climax of To Kill A Mockingbird occurs during the trial of Tom Robinson. For those who haven’t read the novel, Robinson is a black man accused of raping May Ella, a white woman.  Naturally, this causes a social uprising in the generally prejudiced Southern town of Maycomb. Here, Atticus and May Ella beautifully deliver their memorable monologues.
Atticus is an honorable lawyer who stands up for what he knows is right in an attempt to set an example for his children and to encourage his town to question its perspective. Lebano pulls off the character effortlessly, portraying Atticus as a man with an inherent nobility yet tender kindness. Atticus’ famous speech in Tom’s defense sends chills down the viewer’s spine; there were audible sniffles in the crowd as Lebano recited the words that define what it means to see beyond black and white.
This pivotal scene manipulates stage direction to evoke emotion as Atticus often faces the audience when he delivers his final appeal. This conscious effort to include the audience members pulls them on stage, making them feel like they’re sitting on the jury. Though innovative, this production decision can also make the audience feel it is being blamed for the trial’s inevitable decision, an effect that is compelling and simultaneously off-putting.
As for May Ella, Wagner represents the character’s inner conflict beautifully; when the lines call for defiance toward Atticus, her anger toward her abusive father is clear. Likewise, her visible bitter anguish at being caught in between social classes makes the audience pity her.
Other standout performances include Brighid Fleming’s precocious Scout, Robert Manning, Jr.’s defeated yet dignified Tom Robinson and Tara Thomas’s compassionate Calpurnia.
Harper Lee’s compelling story about the loss of innocence and the duality of human nature will be performed on weekends at Sierra Madre Playhouse until Nov. 12.

The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary  Symphony Concert
 This year marked the 25th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda video game saga. Released in Japan in 1986, the first video game, The Legend of Zelda quickly became a gamer staple, and created a cult following in the United States — a following that is still growing.
To celebrate the game’s legendary success, Nintendo is putting together a symphony concert at the Pantages Theatre set to include handpicked songs from the Nintendo composer Koji Kondo.
Performing will be a 70-piece orchestra, a choir and the acclaimed producers from Jason Michael Paul Productions Inc. — who produced “Play! A Video Game Symphony” and have toured the world performing music from video games.
Even if you aren’t a huge gamer or Zelda fan, executive producer Jason Michael Paul promises the concert will still be engaging and entertaining.
If you’re a music aficionado, a Zelda geek or both, check out this once in a lifetime anniversary special.

Downtown Los Angeles has become saturated with Italian restaurants, which is exactly why the owners of the 20-year-old Pasta Primavera on Seventh Street decided to do away with its original concept and bring a new kind of cuisine to Restaurant Row. The result is Citybilly, a cuisine described as “modern American comfort food with a twist,” which opened Sept. 22.
Glimpses of the Italian restaurant are still visible in the space’s Italian-inspired molding and art, but for a new opening, the eatery is off to its own unique start. Waiters wear suspenders with jeans and a button-down, a look that could be kitschy but works in the understated ambiance. The service is friendly — an escape from loud city life.
South burger · New restaurant Citybilly melds the taste of the South with trendy L.A. cuisine. It features a vegetarian portobella burger topped with walnut pesto sauce, smoked mozzarella and fresh baby arugula. - Theresa Huffman | Daily Trojan
The menu is the real star; every item is designed to bring a little bit of city to old country classics. The Mac’n’Cheeses, served in an iron skillet, is made with three cheeses, blended with distinguishable white truffle oil and topped with bread crumbs to give it a slightly upscale flair. Then there are two variations on the twice-baked potato: The City Potato with goat cheese and truffle and the Billy Potato with cheddar, bacon and chives.
Owner Grace Beck takes extra care to include organic, homegrown produce, which is evident in many of the menu items. The pomegranate lemonade is made with Meyer lemons hand-picked from her own garden and the Herb’n’field-style Greens Salad, which can be ordered as a meal or a side, is full of garden fresh flavors.
Other plates also rely on fresh produce to merge Southern cooking with classic Californian and Asian cuisines. The tuna tartare appetizer is accented with pear, avocado and mint aioli, while one of the chicken entrees is topped with yuzu vinaigrette, a dressing made with a traditional Chinese fruit.
Vegetarians who might feel left out at traditional meat-heavy Southern eateries can find hearty flavor in the portobella burger, a meatless twist on a cookout favorite.
The mushroom is topped with smoked mozzarella, walnut pesto, roasted pepper and baby arugula, all sandwiched between a brioche bun.
With solid lunch and dinner menus and a wine list full of bottles from small vineyards, Citybilly is now focusing on possible weekly specials such as burger and beer Mondays or fried chicken and champagne nights, to draw customers with various and even unexpected combinations.
The restaurant is also working on opening a coffee bar stocked with single-origin, hand-dripped coffees as well as organic teas and fresh pastries for the morning work crowd. The space already lends itself to a coffee shop setup; a bar and a glass case sit on one side of the restaurant, separated from most of the tables by a glass partition. If the chocolate blueberry cake available on the regular menu is any indication, the baked goods rival those of well-known nearby pastry shops.
The restaurant has a separate pastries chef, who is currently working with the management to create sweets that look as good as they taste and reflect various cultural elements. For instance, the apple pie in the works is somewhat of a cross between a French tart and an American classic pie, with perfectly placed apple slices and a shiny glaze.
If your schedule doesn’t allow for a trip Downtown during morning hours, try stopping by for lunch between 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. The lunch menu offerings are very similar to those at dinner, but with a cheaper price tag. Still, the pricing is not unreasonable. None of the appetizers or salads exceeds $10, and the entrees are all less than $20.
Everything, from the creative dishes down to the bill, which takes the form of a miniature tin bucket secured with a clothespin, conveys Citybilly’s subtle whimsical nature.

Though the presidential election is still more than a year away, citizens are starting to get a taste, after the Republican debate Tuesday, of who might be running against President Barack Obama as the Republican nominee.
Could it be Rick Perry? Mitt Romney? Michele Bachmann? I omit the others because some unforeseen event must occur for them to resurrect their hopes in the race.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Despite efforts from the spectrum of candidates who have set forth their intentions of defeating the Obama administration, only two have any chance of pulling ahead of the Democrat whose support is slowly dwindling.
Perry and Romney seem to be the only candidates so far to whet the appetite of the Republican Party — Perry for his conservative ideals, and Romney for his mostly moderate, yet charismatic, standings against Obama.
Both are governors, and this is what makes them ideal candidates. Both have dealt with state legislatures, making deals and forming policies.
Members of the executive branch of our federal government should have the qualifications and experience necessary. No questions asked. At the state levels, governors learn to deal with state legislatures and courts. Therefore, it is natural for a governor to be more qualified than other candidates to run for president.
These candidates are pulling ahead and taking voters from Obama and other GOP candidates because of distinct factors that separate them from the rest of the pack.
Candidates who are House representatives, or even our current president, a former senator, are the people who began the bipartisan nature of our government that is in desperate need of fixing.
With Democrats and Republicans now ignoring the issues just to win the next election, this election calls for someone who can handle the pressure of leading the country.
For this country to be run properly and effectively, it should be run by a former governor — Republican or Democrat. A governor who takes the presidency will more likely be able to appease and negotiate smoothly with the other two branches of government — as opposed to a representative or senator who only knows the tricks to getting their party’s way.
A president should be flexible and understand the opposing party’s view. Yes, they can hold and stand for their ideology, but ultimately, they should stand for the country as a whole and work to bring the country’s diverse political stances together.
We do not need more bipartisanship. We do not need more political games. We need a governor as president who will heal our country and make it the great and powerful entity it used to be.

You’re the 99 percent.
Thanks to the Occupy Wall Street protests, that statement is now full of negative connotations: debt, joblessness, misery.
Still, look at the number — what does it actually say?
It’s easy to see why statistics are appealing. They have the power to make broad claims seem concrete.
In a tidy manner, they tell us the scope and seriousness of the problems we face.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Unfortunately, people often arrive at those tidy figures in a disorganized fashion. Few people are dishonest enough to completely falsify their numbers, but many popular statistics create a deceptive picture of reality.
Because new media proliferates statistics at a greater rate than ever before, all levels of education need to address the issue of misleading statistics. Students should come to college with basic skills in statistical analysis.
Take the divorce rate for example. If you’ve heard (and believe) America has a 50 percent divorce rate, you’re not alone. I took that statistic at face value for a long time, having read it again and again.
Recently, though, I came across an article that debunked it. According to The New York Times, this particular statistic determines the divorce rate by calculating the amount of new marriages that end in divorce.
The article estimates that the actual percentage has never been higher than 41 percent.
New media compounds the problem. Though journalists do make mistakes, legitimate media organizations have a system in place to fact check and correct falsehoods that have already been printed.
The same can’t be said for bloggers, who, with a few clicks, can make misleading statistics available to anyone with an Internet connection. Most gossip sites aren’t any better. There’s a better way to filter bunk statistics — getting in touch with our inner skeptics.
Bunk statistics with particularly juicy implications have gone viral. In July, Gawker.com posted a chart showing the White House’s top 21 pay raises. The employee at the top of the list got an 83 percent increase. This statistic was surrounded by familiar inflammatory rhetoric: Government employees cash in while everyone else sizes down.
In August, FactCheck.org put Gawker in its place. The University of Pennsylvania-based nonprofit reviewed White House data more closely and found 19 of the 21 staffers received raises because they had been promoted.
Of those 19, 14 were promoted into existing positions; six were paid the same amount as their predecessors, and five were actually paid less. The chart wasn’t wrong. But taken out of context, it made the government seem like it was just tossing money around.
Social media websites can be even more problematic. We’re more likely to trust information that comes from familiar faces, even if the level of familiarity is low.
Of course, people have long passed on misleading statistics in day-to-day conversation, but idle chatting doesn’t instantly reach 500 people.
Now, the process goes more like this: Someone finds a shocking statistic, he becomes fascinated and he shows it to everyone from his ex-girlfriend to that camp friend he hasn’t actually communicated with in six years.
There’s a missing step, though: asking questions. Where did the numbers come from?
Imposing censorship on blogs and social media websites would be blatantly unconstitutional.
Basic education on the nature of statistics should start at the high school level.
Social science classes should incorporate lessons on rudimentary statistical analysis when students learn to write research papers. It’s important students realize early on that numbers don’t always tell the whole story.
Moreover, high school teachers and college professors alike should encourage students to supplement their news intake with media monitors like FactCheck.org.
Media monitors perform the kind of in-depth analysis most people don’t have the time for. The good ones take transparency seriously; they take readers through the reasoning process.
We can’t debunk every statistic that comes our way, but in the name of knowledge, we have to try.
What is the 99 percent?
 
Maya Itah is a senior majoring in communication. Her column “From Behind the Screen” runs Thursdays.
Wow, you have got to be kidding me… how many crazy lunatics can there possibly be at USC, let alone comment on one post!  Somehow this has turned into some neo-Nazi Holocaust denial convention.  
Please for the love of God can some sane, rational people not filled with hate and disdain for Jews comment on this?  The author must be sickened with embarrassment for what is appearing on her page, even though it’s through no fault of her own.  
Who knew people were so stupid?
So I see this story about questioning statistics has been hijacked by the revisionists and conspiracy theorists.  Oops, did I call names?  Sorry, but I call them like I see them.  Oh, how they love to use scientific terminology and quote “scholarly” works to “prove” their point.  This interaction is actually quite useful to young students reading this thread.  There will ALWAYS be a segment of EVERY society that will go to great lengths to distort the truth with “statistics” and “scientific findings” of their own.  Educate yourselves with basic quantitative analysis, scientific methods, and pay special attention to history so that people who try to snowball you will melt away.
Call whatever you like, but you seem to be missing a point here: it’s not the revisionists who are ‘conspiracy theorists’. If anyone, that would have to be the ‘believers’ – like you, apparently. Because, fact-wise, the ‘Holocaust’ is nothing more than a ‘theory’ of a German ‘conspiracy’ to murder all Jews in Europe.
“(…)with “statistics” and “scientific findings” of their own”
Scientific findings are characterised for being disprovable and reproducible. Which all revisionist findings are. Don’t trust there’s no trace of gas chambers in Auschwitz? Go there, reproduce the experiments and publish your findings, or find some fault with the method used before. THAT is science. Putting words in single quotes is not.
“Educate yourselves with basic quantitative analysis, scientific methods, and pay special attention to history so that people who try to snowball you will melt away.”
This is good advice. Perhaps you could also heed it yourself!
I would not take anything a Jew said about the holocaust, history, Hitler, God or Mickey Mouse as fact.
Any book written by a Jew would be suspect.  I have been studying the holocaust topic for 15 years and have come to the point when reading the “witnesses” accounts and I must say I wouldn’t believe half the things they say.. Either they have embellished others stories, or they have been paid off to tell the story the Holocausters want you to hear or they are delusional.  It would be nice to get these liars and embellisher’s to tell the whole history of the “camps”.  
The cams were set up to make people LIVE not die. They had fumigation chambers for clothes, WHY? To let people die or live? They had showers, they shaved the hair off to prevent typhus, WHY? To make people die or live? You only get half the story when a Jew tells their experience of the “camps” 
If a Jew was in the Japanese interment camps in the USA you would bet that stories of them being made to soap, gassed, experimented on and other so called “horrors” would be rampant. Thank God we we’re saved from the part of history by the Japanese who told the truth. Have a Jew tell the story and forget it.
Joe
CCFIILE.com see holocaust links
Joe: it is obvious that you, like me, are animal (goy). It is not ours to question (despite urging of this article) any statistics quoted by a statistician who said his Kol Nidre.
Our choice is to obey and be rewarded with Civi-LIE-zation or not and end up with Extermination.
As for internment camps, I think it is fair to refer to the entire USA as nothing but a giant internment camp, that all outsiders, especially the Muslim ones, envy because they hate our freedoms (as per the sentence above).
@Honestly:
I get the feeling that you have never delved into the subject of the Holocaust, else you might have questioned the 6  million number.
Where did you discover “…the “fact” that 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust?…”
Where did you get the naïve idea that “…It’s reasonable to question that number…”. Reasonable or no, it is de jure illegal throughout Europe
1. To question the number
2. T o demonstrate conclusively through the science of anatomy; physiology; inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry; geology; hydrology; ballistics; logistically and good ole fashioned common sense that the death of millions of  Jews in gas chambers as recounted by Holocaust survivors is impossible, or
3. Though notwithstanding that  literary tons of National Socialism documents were were collected in the waning days of WW II and subsequent, NOT ONE DOCUMENT HAS EVER BEEN FOUND to show that there was in place a policy for the systematic extermination of Jews.
4.
State publicly or publish any of the above in Europe, and one will find oneself severely deprived of wealth by heavy fines and  a long time of  “three hots and a cot” is some jail in just about any country in Europe. ( More than 11,000 have been so charged in Germany.
And if you think you’re safe outside of Europe, think again (Have you ever stop to think – and then not been able to get started.). “Holocaust denial” which covers a number  thoughts and expressions spoken, published in hard copy or on the net that the Chosen Exceptionalists  find distasteful is a violation of Israeli law for which Israel can seek extradition. It is unlikely that most countries would comply. However, with the “special relationship” that Uncle Sam aka Onkle Schlomo der Schmuck has with Israel WTF you’ll find yourself in the cargo hold of of a Lear Jet paid for by Goldman Sachs heading for Tel Aviv.
Or you could very well be set upon by Jewish thugs, no less evil that Hitler’s Brown shirts or Mussolini’s Black Shirts, as was poor Robert Faurisson, who was nearly beaten to death. Or your warehouse of documents dealing with holocaust revisionism burned to the ground with total destruction of it all. Crime remains unsolved as authorities did a cursory investigation.
Further, if you knew the REAL MEANING of the Magical 6 Million, you would know why it is so important to zionasties around the world and nut cake christonasties here in America that the number remain sacrosanct. Surely, you do not think that Jews pulled that number out their nether parts? So important is that number that as the numbers of deaths as memorialized at Auschwitz was reduced not once but twice, instead of rejoicing over this fact that fewer Jews had died, the Chosen added the subtracted numbers to deaths by gas at  other camps mainly Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka.  
The methods of killing described by “witnesses” is so incredible in  absolute unambiguous definition, that gassing by carbon monoxide generated from the Diesel engine became the agreed upon method. The problem here is that lack of any real knowledge of automotive engineering, the witnesses didn’t know that the exhaust from a Diesel engine, where very stinky IS NOT LETHAL EXCEPT UNDER RARE CIRCUMSTANCES AND A LENGTH OF TIME  THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED GAS CHAMBER DEATHS TO HAVE CONTINUED INTO THE 1970’S IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE MAGIC NUMBERS. Moreover, pumping Diesel fumes into hermetically sealed rooms would caused have at a minimum the roof to blow off. Some witnesses claimed that after the victims were crowded into then hermetically sealed rooms. This would have resulted in the building even if made of brick or concrete to implode. This is elementary high school physics and math.
One would have to have the intellect of the ovine and bovine which is exactly as Talmudists describe goyim.
As Casey Stengel used to say,
Yaah, cud (no puns intended) lookit up!  (Yes. I did intend)
I did and Jett probably did too.
It called critical thinking. It is really important to the learning process. It is verboten to give any critical  thinking to any aspect of the Holocaust unless it passes through the filter of Specialized Jewish Historiography where up is down, mass grave site magically are expanded to accommodate imagined hundreds of thousands of bodies, where bodies are buried in mass graves 10 meters deep in areas where the water table is approximately 5 meters or less as describe by internees attempting to tunnel their way out.
You could look that up, too.
The only thing preventing you from know what Holocaust Revisionists know, is intellectual and cultural sloth.
I mean this in a nice way, of course
Babylon, the Romans and then the Nazis were the destroyers of civilization. Therefore belief in the Holocaust is the founding basis of our modern civilization. Anyone who questions that six-million Jews were exterminated by the Nazis is a DENIER who DENIES CIVILIZATION and must in turn be exterminated as an example of the atrocity that the NAZIS DID and AS AN EXAMPLE TO ALL NEO-NAZI HOLOCAUST DENIERS. For the good of civilization all anti-Semites must perish. NEVER AGAIN!
Perfect!
Thanks.
Is the ” Holocaust ” a ” Religion “?… I have to belief in!
It is highly doubtfull that Babylon,  the Romans and the Nazis are the destroyers of civilization! Is there eventually something else, who would be capeable to help to destroy the leftover of our
almost completely corrupted endtime civilization? What law justifies the extermination of a
” DENIER “?  Where can I find more detailed informations about the six – million Jews, exterminated by the NAZIS?
Honestly, where would you draw the line, if 1 million victims is just as deplorable as 6 million? Let’s keep dividing the number until you finally agree that, Yes, this number is less deplorable.
How about 100 victims, is this just as deplorable, in fact, at what number does the “genocide” tag kick in?
Jett’s comment was about TRUTH, not DENIAL.
Is it not deplorable to play fast and loose with facts, inserting highly questionable claims like soap+lampshades made from dead Jews and prosecuting the skeptics (this has now been totally debunked, yet no one issued a public retraction)?
If not, let’s ramp it up, e.g., golf balls made from human eyeballs, is this deplorable or ridiculous or sacred?
On the other hand, Lancet reported some while ago that over 1 million Iraqis were killed (which by this time probably increased to 2 million, i.e., possibly TWICE the number that is so “tragic, disgusting, or deplorable” to you) by the US occupation.
Would this, well researched FACT, qualify for the same level of compassion, not to mention the reparation claims as the Holocaust? If human life is worth the same everywhere on Earth, then the answer should be YES, yet I do not see it.
I hope you are starting to see the point and if some Iraqi starts claiming that 15 million were killed by Allied invasion and occupation forces, would you say that it makes no difference?
If TRUTH matters at all, how do you arrive at it if you are stigmatized for checking and verifying the claims?
@Honestly, there are a LOT of FACTS in play in this matter. There are Facts concerning numbers (X millions).
There are Facts concerning this Genocide thingie (WHAT): intention to murder a race/class/group on the one hand, versus desire to remove them from one’s “own” living space/enslave them in an existential defense effort against invasion.
There are Facts concerning WHO: not only Who the victims were, BUT Who the perpetrators were: the German invaders, or the vengeful local populace resentful at a group among them who oppressed and harassed them for years prior to the Germans’ arrival.
I already mentioned one of the Facts concerning How (gas chambers).
You can concern yourself, if it somehow suits you, with what I might believe/suppose/doubt, or WHY, or WHO I am, or think I am, or want to be thought (here we go again), OR you can join with me and others in as honest-as-possible an investigation into ALL the evidence for and against various Facts that are alleged or otherwise detected.
And if you’ve REALLY got guts (this is optional), when various previously announced Facts (e.g., the Katyn Massacre, at 15,000 perhaps not a “genocide,” and no Jews for that matter) turn out not to be facts, you can concern yourself with where the misinformation came from, and go right back into the Who, How, When, Where, Why.
It’s all very interesting. But all I’m asking for is a stop to the name-calling, recriminations, and the hairy eyeball.
Nice words here from Mr. Jett Rucker. Comes off as very open minded, but manages to distort several important components.
1) Mr. Rucker presumes no discussion is allowed on the Holocaust, specifically the number of victims and how such a figure was achieved. Academic discussion IS allowed regarding the Holocaust. It takes place everyday here in the United States, as well as around the world wherein new evidence and theories are raised regarding such a horrible event. Those who deny the event (as Mr. Rucker wishes) are allowed to voice their views, but their ARGUMENTS are not deemed serious by the overwhelming majority of scholars.  
2) The issue and definition of “genocide” is also still in debate among those in the field of genocide studies. It is my understanding that when one group targets another and acts to  “remove them from one’s “own” living space/enslave them in an existential defense effort against invasion”, such would not be regarded as genocide by many scholars; instead perhaps a form of ethnic cleansing or the like. It should be kept in mind, however, that while Mr. Rucker would like to view the Holocaust as just such an event -non genocide- such is simply not supported by the wealth of eyewitness, documentary, and material evidence.
3) Questions of ‘Who, How, When, Where, Why’ are indeed important topics to consider for any type of critical analysis on a theory. Such questions provide a helpful litmus test in weeding out fanciful theories berefit of evidence, as the case of Holocaust denial.
SO GLAD to encounter your inclination to discuss matters (notwithstanding your imputations of beliefs/motivations to me)!
Genocide is a label, used to demonize the intentions of a group (a group’s INTENTIONS CANNOT be treated as a single thing, even IF an individual’s can). Discussions about its definition remind me of disquisitions about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.
I deny NOTHING, except (tentatively) the construction/use of gas chambers AND a genocidal INTENT, and I’m willing/eager to consider evidence to the contrary.
DO  carry on! Discussion/debate is the point, and at the point where we’re doing that, I’ve gotten what I want.
Mr. Rucker,
I didn’t intend to insinuate any motivations towards you besides those which you seem to be actively supportive of, particularly the denial of gassings as a form of extermination, which is serves as an integral component of the Holocaust. You later state that you deny the construction/use of gas chambers, as well as genocidal intent by the Nazis. I wouldn’t accuse you of being a Nazi or whathave you, if that is how you took it-apologies.
I appreciate that you are eager to discuss the evidence for these matters. I do enjoy debating the topic as I do enjoy challenging my own views and reinforcing them with research and information. We can strongly agree. A debate over the necessary evidence is likely to be inappropriate to the USC forum.
I would suggest CODOH’s own discussion forum but debate is highly restricted at that site. I myself was permanently banned from the site, despite having constructive discussions with a number of revisionists, including Dr. Nicholas Kollerstrom. As you are affiliated with CODOH, might I ask why that is so? I laud your free speech and open debate ideals but paradoxically this is not so within your own ‘back yard’ or so it appears.
Yours truly,
Ray
Here, our poster (among other things) demonstrates a critical activity at the heart of what we often hear is the purpose and function of the academy: DISCUSSION – in this case, of an iconic statistic.
There are other statistics just as iconic, and more-hallowed, that you’re NOT ALLOWED to discuss, NOT EVEN in the academy, or at USC in particular. Take, for example, the Six Million Jews said to have been killed during World War II by the Nazis. No Discussion of THAT one!
Take issues like whether the Nazis designed, built, and used gas chambers to rack up that sacred statistic. UH-UH! Discuss THAT one, and you’ll have Hillel and the Anti-Defamation League (which DEFENDS the defamation of Germans) all over you!
In fact, I’ll be surprised if this comment even makes it past the censors. Maybe you’ll never see it, proving my point. And you’ll go on thinking that you’re free to discuss the statistics people use on each other.
Wow, didn’t see where that post was going right away.
But yeah, if private groups want to go after you for questioning a statistic, I suppose they can. It will be hard, also, to get any grant money to research the claim, since most people don’t want to touch it with a 39 1/2 foot pole. You can see the difference why, though, when it could be construed as questioning genocide or Israel’s right to exist. Indeed, you’ll raise some hackles.   Talking about divorce rates and wealth distribution isn’t nowhere near so touchy (though even the 99% talk brings up cries of “class warfare!”).
So yeah, I think if you can go find a funder for a rigorous, peer-reviewed investigation and ignore the complaints of the ADL, go for it.  Until then, though, that one is accepted conventional wisdom and playing the holocaust-denial game gets you in hot water.
Jett, I get the feeling that you do not believe the “fact” that 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust?  It’s reasonable to question that number as long as you are not attempting to deny the FACT that a genocide occurred and that genocide in unacceptable under any circumstances.  So what if that number was exaggerated and ONLY 3 million innocent men, women, and children were killed because of their religion?  Or how about 1 million?  Would it be any less tragic, disgusting, or deplorable?  To most people, the answer is NO.  The exact number is not nearly as important as the meaning behind it.
Professor Arthur Butz gives the definitive comment on the “Holocaust” in his book “The Hoax of the Twentieth Century”:
“The Jews of Europe were not exterminated and there was no German attempt to exterminate them.  The Germans resettled a certain number and these people were ultimately resettled again in accordance with Allied programs.  Although various statistical details are missing from our analysis, it was possible to reconstruct quantitative aspects of the problem to a satisfactory degree.
   The Jews of Europe suffered during the war by being deported to the East, by having much of their property confiscated and, more importantly, by suffering cruelly in the circumstances surrounding Germany’s defeat.  They may even have lost a million dead.
   The “gas chambers” were wartime propaganda fantasies completely comparable to the garbage that was shoveled out by Lord Bryce and associate in World War I.  The factual basis for these ridiculous charges was nailed down with perfect accuracy by Heinrich Himmler, in an interview with a representative of the World Jewish congress (Dr, Norbert Masur) just a few weeks before the end of the war.”
   ‘In order to put a stop to the epidemics, we were forced to burn the bodies of incalculable numbers of people who had been destroyed by disease.  We were therefore forced to build crematoria, and on this account they are knotting a noose for us.’  (Source: Gerald Reitlinger, The Final Solution).

On Oct. 17, the music world went up in arms as two of the most anticipated albums of the season were leaked online a week before their intended debuts. Kelly Clarkson’s Stronger and Coldplay’s Mylo Xyloto are the latest victims of the bittersweet Internet album leak.
Both albums were slated for release Oct. 24. Clarkson has been extremely vocal about leaking songs on the Internet and has taken to her personal website to communicate such disapproval to her fans and colleagues. The singer has even adopted a defensive self-leaking strategy she hopes will curtail the leak of her entire album. She has been releasing her “own leaks” slowly to build anticipation for the new album.
But it seems the damage has already been done.
Famed blogger Perez Hilton posted a negative review of Clarkson’s new album on his Twitter a week before the album is due to hit stores. The blogger succinctly stated “Sadly, Kelly Clarkson’s album leaked today and while it’s not BAD BAD, it’s far from good and mainly just boring. #Bummer.”
The staff at Clarkson Camp are hoping that these early negative reviews don’t harm first week sales any more than the leak already has impacted them. Plus, it’s no help that the first Stronger single, “Mr. Know It All” was a dud for Clarkson’s standards.
On the other hand, Coldplay’s album has been garnering generally positive reviews. The album is being seen as an step away from Viva La Vida and previous records, taking on more of an electronic-synth sound and toning down the stadium rock elements that have made the band such a success.
A definite single from the album, “Princess of China,” has also been getting a lot of attention on the leak-circuit. The track, which features Rihanna, has been multiplying on Youtube and attracting rave reviews and music video requests.
While the two acts will go on to promote their albums like nothing ever happened, its clear that the leaks will have an impact on their bottom lines. And while fans might enjoy having the album for free a week before it goes public, the artists are the ones who are losing here.

McDonald’s is intriducing its own TV channel — the company announced Oct. 17 it will begin establishing it in about 800 McDonald’s outlets in Central and Southern California in the near future.
McDonald’s Channel will target its dine-in customers. It will broadcast local news in addition to entertainment programming. Vimby, a Van Nuys-based digital production company, will be one of the major content providers.
According to ChannelPort Communications, the LA-based entertainment technology company managing the latest implementation, the channel will now be able to reach out to 18 to 20 million people every month.
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Alison Trope, an Associate Professor at USC Annenberg, noted, “It used to be that the television didn’t move. Now corporations can tap into anyone’s consumer behavior at every of the day and brand their message.”
The channel, to be streamed in HD, will be visible from about 70 percent of the sitting space. The remaining regions would be classified as “quiet zones,” to be used by customers who do not wish to be disturbed.
Of an hour-long broadcast, eight minutes have been marked out for advertising. McDonald’s own advertising will be restricted to only 90 seconds of that duration.
Leland Edmondson, founder of ChannelPort, told the Times, “The intention is to catch and engage the customer, and then enhance their experience. This network is not intended to be all about McDonald’s. It is all about the consumer. The McDonald’s customer is everyone, and we want not to be passive viewers but to be active and participatory with this network.”

On Oct. 18, Philadelphia police began seeking some 50 people potentially victimized by Linda Ann Weston, the woman who recently held four mentally handicapped adults captive in an apartment basement.
The prisoners and two small dogs were shut in a 15-by-15 foot boiler room behind a steel door, in which one victim was chained to the boiler pipe. The only nourishment was a container of orange juice, and a mayonnaise jar served as their toilet.
The landlord of the apartment building found the individuals malnourished in the room this Saturday after investigating complaints about suspicious activity near the basement. The victims struggled to communicate to the authorities how long they were held in the room, but police estimate around 10 days.
The discovery of Social Security cards and other documents found in Weston’s home have spawned a new police investigation. Drivers licenses, Social Security cards and power-of-attorney forms were found, forcing authorities to look into whether these people were kidnapped or if the documents were stolen. Police are also looking into the possibility that Weston was possibly receiving money from the victims’ disability checks.
The Inquirer reported that Weston imprisoned 25-year-old Bernardo Ramos in the closet of her Philadelphia apartment in 1981. She served eight years in prison for starving him to death after he reportedly refused to support her sister’s unborn baby.
Weston, 51, along with two other men, Eddie Wright and Gregory Thomas, face charges that include criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, kidnapping, criminal trespass, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment. Their bail was set this Monday to $2.5 million each, according to CNN.
The victims were hospitalized after being discovered, and have been listed in stable condition with malnourishment as their only injury. A preliminary hearing on the charges and evidence in the case is set for Oct. 24.

This year’s installment of the tradition-rich USC-Notre Dame rivalry features two of the more prolific offenses in the country to date.
Despite starting the year 0-2, Notre Dame has rebounded well, vaunting itself into the top 25 ranked offenses in the country. The Irish stand at 22nd in yards per game with 467. While USC has thrived on the passing game so far, Notre Dame features a solid, balanced offensive scheme. Sophomore gunslinger Tommy Rees has the Irish ranked 32nd in the country with 277.8 passing yards per game. By contrast, USC is 25th nationally with 301.5 ypg.
The Notre Dame ground game has also done its part, offering an exceptional compliment to the passing game. The play of California native Cierre Wood (650 yards) and steady senior Jonas Gray (395) have the Fighting Irish ranked 30th nationally in rushing yards per game with 194 per game. USC’s rushing stats pale in comparison to Notre Dame’s, with the Trojans posting just 133.5 rush yards per game, good for 77th in the country.
What does all this mean? Well, as good as USC’s offense has been this season, Notre Dame’s has outshoen the Trojans’ through the first six games. To make matters worse for ‘SC, starting running back Marc Tyler, freshman phenom wide receiver Marqise Lee, and corner back Torin Harris are all recovering from shoulder injuries and remain questionable for Saturday’s contest.
Rees has Notre Dame rolling the past two weeks, guiding the Irish to back-to-back 500 yard performances while tossing 6 touchdowns and no interceptions in the process.
If the Trojans are to pull off a victory in South Bend this weekend, they must limit the production of Notre Dame’s offensive assault. USC is used to shootouts, and another one could be in store this Saturday.

Patients lined up early Monday morning to receive wristbands that serve as a ticket to the clinic later in the week – only 5,000 were available and all were quickly snatched up. Each wristband signifies a day and time to arrive at the clinic, and organizers hope to serve approximately 1,200 each day.
“When people are here at the crack of dawn, it makes the point in a very demonstrative way that there is an increased need for health services for the uninsured and underinsured,” L.A. County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas told the Los Angeles Times.
Cardiologists, podiatrists, vision specialists and dentists will volunteer this weekend to provide free examinations, check ups, screenings and information on follow-up care.
Many of the patients who waited in line Monday are unemployed, uninsured, employed but don’t receive benefits and even undocumented immigrants who don’t qualify for state or federal health care aid.
“It’s really expensive,” Gladys Menendez told the Times. “A week’s pay won’t even cover a [dental] filling.”
This is the fourth clinic of its kind that CareNow has hosted in Los Angeles. The non-profit organization aims to increase health care access to those in need.
Im not going to say what everyone else has already said, but I do want to comment on your knowledge of the topic.  Youre truly well-informed.

The USC women’s golf team rode a strong debut from freshman Doris Chen, who notched a score of 4-under 67 in her opening round to help lead the shorthanded Women of Troy to an eventual sixth place finish at the 2011 Stanford Intercollegiate in Palo Alto, Calif.
Participating in its second tournament of the season, USC finished play with an overall score of even 852, ten strokes off the lead. The Women of Troy watched crosstown rival UCLA record its second straight tournament victory, as the Bruins finished first at 10-under 842, followed by Vanderbilt and Washington.
In the final round, Lisa McCloskey recorded a score of 1-over 72 and finished tied for 10th at 2-under 211, the highest standing among the Women of Troy. Rachel Morris recorded yet another strong tournament finish, reaching a tie for 16th at even 213. Chen, who struggled to 4-over 75 on Sunday, nonetheless finished tied for 20th at 1-over 214, a laudable result for her USC debut. Inah Park also shot 1-over 72 on the final round to finish tied with Chen and three others at 1-over.
Washington’s SooBin Kim led all players in scoring, finishing with an impressive 13-under 200. Rounding out the top three were Oregon’s Cassy Isagawa at 9-under 204 and Vanderbilt’s Marina Alex at 6-under 207. Park was USC’s best player and finished 6-under 207, but played individually and thus did not see her scores count toward the team’s total.
On Saturday, there was an overall improvement for the Women of Troy from the first day, but it also came at a high cost. Sophia Popov, the reigning NGCA Freshman of the Year, suffered a wrist injury and bowed out of the tournament, leaving the already undermanned team with a big hole in its lineup.
Despite Popov’s injury and freshman Kristen Park’s scores counting only individually, the Women of Troy rebounded to finish play Saturday tied for fourth. McCloskey channeled five birdies into a final score of 4-under 67, tying teammate Inah Park for ninth place.
Chen, who rode her hot hand to a 4-under standing after 12 holes, struggled to 3-over before finishing strong at 1-over. Inah Park jumped 11 spots to 23rd at even 142, while a strong second round aided Morris to a 26th at 2-over 144.
Chen tallied an impressive four birdies in her first round, and recorded pars on the remaining 14 holes. Seniors Inah Park and Lisa McCloskey both finished tied for 34th at 1-over 72 with four and two birdies, respectively. Sophomores Popov and Rachel Morris tied for 43rd at 2-over 73.
The Women of Troy have a quick turnaround and seek to improve upon their last two tournaments this weekend as they conclude the fall season with the Pac-12/SEC Challenge in Knoxville, Tenn.
