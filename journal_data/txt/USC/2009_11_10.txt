If you were asked to name the most prominent figure on the USC campus, you probably wouldn’t think twice.
This is no knock on long-tenured professors, school deans and university presidents, but USC coach Pete Carroll is the face of not only the illustrious football program, but of the entire university.
Winning philosophy · Writer Steve Bisheff gets to the core of what makes USC’s football team so successful: Pete Carroll’s competitiveness. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
He is the ultimate symbol of success, the epitome of hard work and dedication, and a modern-day legend who transformed himself from a last-resort head coaching candidate in 2000 to this decade’s most prolific collegiate coach.
While Carroll’s tenure at USC can be summed up with staggering numbers, rarely have Trojan fans, alumni or even the casual enthusiasts had the opportunity to understand the man beyond the on-field fame.
Steve Bisheff, a USC alumnus and sports writer for the Los Angeles Times was given exclusive access to the well-oiled machine that is the Trojan football program. Over the course of the 2008-2009 campaign, Bisheff was treated to an experience that featured everything from summer meetings to locker room celebrations, to one-on-one interviews with Carroll.
With this access, Bisheff wrote Always Compete, whose title is based on Carroll’s 2007 banquet speech. Always Compete not only chronicled the 2009 Rose Bowl championship team, but allowed readers into the complex mind of the “ultimate competitor,” Carroll himself.
On the surface, Always Compete, which hit bookstores this past September, looks like the typical thrilling season recap of a team’s search for the often elusive championship a la Jim Dent’s Resurrection: The Miracle Season that Saved Notre Dame, or Jack McCallum’s Seven Seconds or Less.
And while the outer tale of Bisheff’s story revolves around the trials and tribulations of the Trojans’ season, what makes this book a must-read are the core chapters of the story, known as “Pete Profiles.”
These candid sections shed light on the activist, the family man, the free spirit and the unique motivator that makes Carroll “the most revered sports personality in Los Angeles along with Kobe Bryant.”
Although Bisheff’s book pays tribute to Carroll, his national powerhouse football team and his non-profit organization, A Better LA, Bisheff emphasizes that “this is not a cheerleading book gushing about the coach.”
“I tried to write it as an objective journalist in the third person and it addresses what many see as Carroll’s faults,” Bisheff writes.
Although many consider Carroll’s short tenure at USC on par with some of the game’s greatest leaders, including Bear Bryant, Woody Hayes (who Carroll had the privilege of meeting in 1979 while on the Ohio State coaching staff) and Joe Paterno, the book’s most compelling profile, “No, He’s Not Perfect,” stresses Bisheff’s message that his piece doesn’t solely celebrate the competitive nature of the highly decorated coach.
Throughout the chapter, Carroll’s deficiencies are put under the spotlight, and the author expertly humanizes a man who, by the standards of the Trojan faithful, may be closer to a god-like figure than your everyday college football head coach.
From detailed explanations about Carroll’s inability to win against lesser conference foes to his style — which, at times is overly controlling — that tumultuously forced out offensive mastermind Norm Chow, this “Pete Profile” reveals a side to Carroll that packed crowds inside the Coliseum couldn’t comprehend by watching his weekly dominance on the gridiron.
After covering the coach throughout a full season, Bisheff admits that each and every second of Carroll’s life is a competition within itself.
“He’ll compete at anything, including a pickup basketball game or how many Mountain Dews he can drink in his office,” Bisheff writes.
While anecdotal stories preaching Carroll’s eccentric competitive nature are prevalent throughout the book, it is Bisheff’s knack for interweaving these insightful stories with the coach’s touching relationships with family, players, coaches and alumni that make the underlying story even more compelling than the actual blow-by-blow account of the 2008 season.
The book is a must-read, not because it is synonymous with a perennial Pac-10 championship team or because its central figure is a living legend who continues to etch his mark into university lore each Saturday.
Rather, it is the poignant and at times humbling lens through which Bisheff depicts all parties involved that makes Always Compete a rare treat for readers.
Although Bisheff says there are no life lessons or profound teachings that stand out in the book, his 237-page account of a year inside the USC football program is an instantly gratifying experience that everyone can relate to.
From the proud father to the community organizer, and from the top recruiter to the awe-inspiring coach, Always Compete doesn’t miss a beat with its factual, humorous and yet heartfelt portrayal of USC’s most recognizable employee. In doing so, the book promotes Carroll, flaws and all, not only as a local hero but as a national icon.

Paul Rockower walks the USC campus decked out in bling from around the world.
“This is from Tibet,” Rockower said, fiddling with a metal bracelet that looks like it was formerly a decorative silverware handle. “I traded a Chicago Cubs T-shirt for it in Shigatse.”
Common bonds · Displaying now through May 2010, Paul Rockower’s exhibit, 21st Century Family of Man, represents the masters of public diplomacy major’s last 11 years of traveling the world as a student, journalist and explorer. India, Israel and China are among the countries he has visited. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The USC master of public diplomacy student also sports an array of necklaces — a charm from a shrine in Pakistan, another from a sheik temple, Brazilian nuts dangling from knotted twine, a simple silver Star of David — collected during the past 11 years of exploring the world as a student, journalist and explorer.
In the second-floor Annenberg Gallery, Rockower’s travels are documented in a more accessible form. Selected from thousands of images taken during his adventures around the globe, 21st Century Family of Man exhibit features a lobby and conference room’s worth of professional-grade photos documenting the commonality among the people and places Rockower has encountered.
“The overall connection is that family is family wherever you go,” Rockower said. “You can be anywhere in the world and find similarities.”
As the first student to utilize the space, Rockower also hopes that 21st Century Family of Man will turn the Annenberg Gallery — primarily an outlet for working artists — into a student arena. Previous exhibits have showcased Pulitzer Prize-winning photo essays, editorial cartoons and 1960s political posters, but never student works.
“You make your opportunities by asking for it and hopefully more students will see it and take advantage,” Rockower said.
Both the exhibition’s title and subject matter are throwbacks to the groundbreaking 1955 New York Museum of Modern Art show titled The Family of Man. The original Family of Man featured 503 black-and-white photographs taken by 273 amateur and professional photographers from around the world.
Like a mirror reflecting images of the world back onto itself, the exhibition brought striking photos of the human existence to viewers living in a tumultuous post-war era. The message of basic cultural similarities was so strong that The Family of Man spent the next eight years touring the world, eventually showing in 37 countries on six continents.
But a lot has changed since 1955.
“The original Family of Man was very much an element of the generation it came from. At the time, the pictures were universal, but now, they look dated,” Rockower said.
Advancements in commercial travel and information technology have created a post-postmodern world smaller than the one captured in the original MOMA exhibit, and though human commonality is still a reality, it was in desperate need of a visual update.
Through both 35mm film and digital photography, Rockower’s 21st century revamp captures the essence of our new common bonds if not through lush, color images of Nigerian children wearing Britney Spears shirts, then by virtue of the exhibit’s creation.
“Fifty years ago, you needed [about] 300 photographers to capture the world,” Rockower said. “Now, because of changes in communication and travel, I can do what it took [about] 300 photographers to do.”
Although the diverse display of cultures is Rockower’s first major exhibition, the self-taught photographer’s goals for sharing his Picasa Web Album are loftier than simple bragging rights. As a student in the country’s first and only public diplomacy program, Rockower hopes that by bringing the images of the world to USC, he can create a two-way dialogue that will inspire students to travel and see for themselves how alike humanity can be.
“Traveling is an investment in yourself,” Rockower said. “It’s so easy, it’s so much fun and it’s so beneficial.”
The self-proclaimed “bohemian, Orientalist Zionist” grew up on the East Coast, but found a rush in traveling at a young age. During high school, his involvement with the Young Judea group took him on a summer trip to Israel. Wanting to learn more about the country, he spent a year studying in Jerusalem and then backpacked around Europe for six weeks.
“It was such a mind-blowing experience because I was 19 and here I am wandering around Prague,” Rockower said.
After graduating from Brandeis University in Massachusetts with a bachelor’s degree in Islamic and Middle Eastern studies, Rockower nabbed a job at the Israeli Foreign Ministry in Houston and spent time exploring the diversity in his own backyard.
“I treated Texas as a study abroad experience. It’s got such a different culture and I could appreciate it as something different,” Rockower said. “I could call myself the Israeli Ambassador to the Republic of Texas.”
Through a rotary fellowship, Rockower ended up in South Africa, reporting on Jewish communities in remote villages for the Jerusalem Post and continued to alternate between traveling and working until finally deciding to relocate to Los Angeles to attend USC. As of this past summer’s trip to Japan, he has been to 45 countries.
The 21st Century Family of Man showcases 70 photos of somber adults, happy children, obscure cities and recognizable monuments, documenting a period of Rockower’s life that has made him who he is today.
“I want people to see the world and realize how similar we are and how rewarding it is to take those steps,” Rockower said. “It’s a matter of trying to understand the way the world is, but you can’t understand it if you don’t see it, taste it or hear the music.”

When a small independent film achieves mainstream success through several festival wins and early critical praise, a tidal wave of backlash is almost inevitable.
Usually, the innocent underdog is tossed on a pedestal so fast that Oscar purists are quick to call sabotage before the hype can smother anybody else. Slap the names Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry into the marketing campaign, and the skepticism concerning the film’s “indie cred” continues to spike.
Oscar contender · After a strong showing at the Sundance and Toronto film festivals, Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire is becoming one of the leading, and most unlikely films of the 2009 Academy Awards race. - Photo courtesy of Lionsgate
But with its kitchen sink realism,  Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire is the antithesis of everything you’ve ever known about award-winning films, which seem to adhere to a rather formulaic set of conventions: biopic, political drama and period piece.
Yes, Precious is the only film in history to have won both the prestigious Grand Jury Prize at Sundance and the People’s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. But if you asked Precious herself what she thinks about these superfluous awards, she’d probably repeat the first words we hear her say out loud in the film: “Shut the fuck up.”
Precious tells the story of a 16-year-old overweight African-American girl living in Harlem in the late 1980s. Adding to her hardship is her pregnancy with her second child — the result of an abusive father — and the fact that she is stuck in a crowded public high school where she is either ignored or tormented.
Her home life is even worse: Her mother, Mary, lives off fried pig’s feet, cigarettes, Jeopardy reruns and stolen welfare checks.
Precious’ only saving grace comes in the form of an alternative school called Each One Teach One, where she learns to read and write and make her story known to her classmates and teacher, Ms. Rain. If this sounds grotesquely cavalier, then you don’t know Precious well enough.
Even though many viewers might feel the unfortunate lifestyle thrust upon Precious is exploited, the film is saved by director Lee Daniels — who produced Monster’s Ball — and his decision to present the film the way Precious sees her world. Told with elaborate fantasy sequences, upbeat jazz music and plenty of humor, the film is a rare, strikingly balanced mix of anger, dread and, ultimately, hope.
Precious is just as much of a fairytale as it is a documentary. Although many obstacles — which seem especially horrific if you know nothing about Harlem in the ’80s — are thrown at Precious, she maintains a sense of optimism because this is the only environment she’s ever known.
She deals with rape and incest in the same way suburban white kids deal with getting their lunch money stolen. It’s this breezy tone that makes Precious’ life and emotions so relatable.
Also carrying the film is brilliant acting by the unlikely casting of Mariah Carey (Glitter) and stand-up comic Mo’Nique, who gives an honest, jaw-dropping performance as the abusive yet mentally ill mother responsible for making Precious’ life nothing less than a lucid nightmare.
Newcomer Gabourey Sidibe gives a subtle, calculated performance as the title character, managing to invent an individual we have never before seen on the silver screen, yet still somehow feel like we’ve known our entire lives.
Precious is not an easy film to swallow, but it is necessary for every American to digest. As an indie favorite, it’s going to be very easy for the public to classify the film as a Sundance gimmick trying to infiltrate the mainstream circuit, but part of the film’s message is about looking past the extraneous and focusing on the truth.
With a shrug of the shoulders, Precious eradicates the naïve deception of so-called poverty porn in the same way that it proves a hurricane of hype might mean the film is — surprise — actually worth seeing.
I agree that the situations and acting present in Precious were very realistic, but I feel that Daniels ruined this realism by filming the whole thing with such self-conscious bombast (those fantasy sequences were awful) and eyes for lurid detail. It’s a very heavy handed movie that had the potential to be a seriously jarring, unforgettably powerful film. Just imagine if someone like Charles Burnett had  directed.

Walking around USC, a student passes about seven fast food or chain restaurants that serve cheap burgers or beef tacos for every one eatery that can make an edible salad. Such is the sad state of accessible food in most American cities.
For those students who test the waters of vegetarianism, there is a dearth of options. But with USC’s sustainability grade still lagging at a meager C+ on the Sustainable Endowments Institute’s College Sustainability Report Card, student health wouldn’t be the only thing to gain from more vegetarian venues.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
With an annual per capita average of 270 pounds, Americans are the world’s biggest meat consumers. Granted, meat tastes (really) good, but the main two reasons for adopting a vegetarian diet are too important to ignore.
Without mentioning ethics, eating meat has been found to cause deadly illnesses and contributes greatly to pollution and global warming.
High cholesterol and heart disease have long been foes of public health, but they have become of particular concern as obesity rates continue to climb in the United States.
Researches at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary found that fruits and vegetables contain salicylic acid, a chief ingredient in aspirin, which has been found to decrease risk of heart disease and breast and lung cancer.
The researchers then compared an otherwise homogenous group of vegetarian and meat-eating monks and people from the community, and found that the vegetarians had bodily levels of salicylic acid that were 12 times higher than in non-vegetarians.
Animal protein has also been linked to numerous types of cancer. Dr. T. Colin Campbell, a professor at Cornell University, has conducted experiments in which he substituted plant-based protein for animal-based protein.
The results showed the substitution helped halt or even reverse the advance of cancer in test rodents.
Larger-scale studies on meat and human health have yielded similar results. A National Institute of Health study followed 500,000 individuals between the ages of 51 and 70 for eight years. Those who regularly consumed red meat had rates of  esophageal, colorectal, lung and liver cancer that were between 20 to 60 percent higher than those who ate little or no red meat.
The consumption of meat impacts not only one’s own body, but the entire society and ecosystem we live in. A lengthy 2006 United Nations report identified many hazardous environmental problems directly resulting from animal farming.
Animal agriculture was found to contribute to 18 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, compared to the 13.5 percent that is emitted by the much more publicized transportation sector’s emissions.
Animal farming produces 65 percent of all human-produced nitrous oxide and 37 percent of such methane, which are estimated to each have at least 21 times more effect on global warming than carbon dioxide.
For those stragglers who still don’t believe in global warming, the UN report also cited meat production as a “massive” water and land polluter and likely the number one contributor to water pollution in third world countries.
Worldwide, 70 percent of fresh water usage goes towards animal agriculture.
Additionally, the meat industry plays a major role in global deforestation and the spread of animal-born diseases.
This is not to say that every time somebody eats a burger, they starve a child in India, raise the ocean levels an inch, spread the flu, contract cancer and have a heart attack. But there is evidence that meat is a primary contributor to many global problems.
Naysayers will claim that one person altering their diet won’t change anything. But if you vote in political elections, avoid littering or turn off your lights when you’re not home, you probably do believe implicitly that your actions have an effect on the world.
Avoiding meat in college can be especially difficult, as cafeterias don’t always have a good variety of vegetarian dishes. USC recently began an initiative called V2O that is meant to increase vegetarian, vegan and organic options in cafeterias, but has so far not declared a vegetarian-only outlet where students can spend their dining dollars.
Such a restaurant would have many benefits for USC and its students. It could buy produce exclusively from the many local farmers’ markets in the area, thereby supporting local agriculture and ensuring fresh food.
This in turn could boost USC’s C+ grade, which it’s held for three years.
With the addition of a healthy and accessible food outlet, new students might find it easier to keep off the dreaded weight gain that accompanies new college-level stress.
Most importantly, an exclusively vegetarian restaurant at USC would send a strong message that vegetarianism is a viable diet option.

YES!! About time someone puts what I’ve been thinking in an article. I’ve been a vegetarian for two years, and so far, it hasn’t killed me. Gosh, I’ve forgotten what meat even tastes like (but my sister says my veggie meat tastes quite a bit like the real deal, usually). It really is a pain to get vegetarian food around Porterville (my crappy hometown). Burger King (bless their soul) is the only fast food place where I can get something other than fries or what they say is a salad (though I’m not entirely convinced). I wish we had a Chipotle here in P-Town. That place makes the most delicious (and planet conscience) food. Their salads are to die for, just saying. I’m glad USC is working to promote vegetarianism. Not just because it’s wrong to eat another living being, but because it’ll help our planet. Oh goodness, now looking back reading my comment, I sound like a liberal! Horrid.

It’s been a long time since Facebook — like shower sandals, cheap beer and pretentious art posters — was associated exclusively with college students.
I don’t think anyone begrudges this transition, though it is always alarming to see your mother comment on the sweater you wore to “LAS VEGAS TRIP(PY) Part Deux.”
But whereas it once might have been strange to see a status update from your professor regarding his favorite bar, or a wall post from your 10-year-old cousin, the site’s shift toward the mainstream was always inevitable.
The passionately joined and casually abandoned groups with names like “REMOVE THE NEWSFEED OR WE’RE ALL GOING TO FRIENDSTER” — rest in peace.
Surely, one of the most important reasons there has never been a mass Facebook exodus is that the site has never allowed its users to plaster their profiles with blaring music, nauseating wallpapers and animated jpegs of dancing kittens.
Bumper stickers and graffiti had their moment in the sun, but since becoming a network for everyone, Facebook has kept it relatively classy. With one glaring exception: social gaming.
If you’re racking your brain as to what this is, it’s because you would only recognize it in this context:
“Tobias found a sad Ugly Duckling on their farm. Oh no! Tobias was farming when a sad, Ugly Duckling wandered onto their farm in FarmVille. This poor ducky ran away from his old home because the other ducklings made fun of him. He feels very sad and could use a new home.”
Next to this strange paragraph, there is generally a picture of a purple duck with big, sad eyes. And next to that picture is the profile picture of your most socially obtuse and sun-deprived friend.
FarmVille, and others like it, constantly barrage news feeds with bizarre and jarring updates like, “Gretchen sold a harvest of Guavas, Persimmon and Blueberries for 8230 coins. Yay!”
The status updates are designed to lure in new users — users with the interests and reading levels of third graders, and, most importantly, users with credit cards.
These social games don’t just exist to make your newsfeed look as though it was written by a children’s book author with a Twitter account and Kid Pix. They also scam users into giving up their credit card numbers and paying hidden fees without realizing it.
A report on Technorati.com points out that unless users opt to pay upfront to play the games, they have to earn “coins” or other currency by filling out surveys or signing up for free trials, which inevitably result in them purchasing unwanted subscriptions to Netflix or DVD learning programs.
Facebook has a policy against these kinds of scams but they have yet to take a stand against them, perhaps because social games are such a big profit maker for the site.
So the next time you see a MafiaWars status that says, “Brett helped Julie gun down an enemy crew at the airport and wants you to help too,” click hide.
It won’t do anything to stop social gaming, but it will make your newsfeed look a little more normal.

Rating: PG
Length: 96 min.

When film critics and audiences alike believed no animated film could top the incredibly innovative and heartfelt WALL-E, Pixar Animation Studios upped the stakes — again — with Up, the colorful, slightly more mature tale of misanthropic 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Edward Asner).
A former balloon salesman left alone an disgruntled after the death of his wife, Carl attaches thousands of balloons to his unassuming two-story house and sails into the air, his sights set on South America. What Carl doesn’t account for, however, is the company of a motor-mouth of a boy scout, Russell.
Between Russell’s irritating but well-intentioned mannerisms and the presence of the spunky canine Dug and protective jungle bird Kevin, Carl’s hardened heart gradually cracks, turning the wild adventure through the Amazon into an emotionally complex journey.
Although it’s difficult to capture the film’s visual beauty on the small screen, much of Up’s breathtaking cinematography  is preserved in the DVD’s widescreen format. The one-disc DVD set also features a couple bonuses, notably the feature-based short film Dug’s Special Mission and the theatrical short Partly Cloudy, which was screened in theaters prior to the film.
The Ugly Truth
Rating: R
Length: 105 min.
Now available
Katherine Heigl (Knocked Up, 27 Dresses) and Gerad Butler (300, P.S. I Love You) star in this clichéd romantic comedy that doubles as a slapstick battle of the sexes. Heigl plays Abby Richter, a high-strung morning TV show producer whose program is in danger of cancelation because of low ratings.
To garner more viewers, the station hires the rough, brash and pseudo-misogynistic TV personality, Mike Chadway (Butler), who almost instantly clashes with Abby’s control-freak nature. Mike begins to teach Abby how to relax and find her inner femme fatale, Abby teaches Mike a little bit about relationships, the two slowly put aside their differences, acknowledge their sexual chemistry and fall in love — fade to black, roll credits.
Like the film’s trite plot, the DVD includes the expected: alternate endings, deleted scenes and an exclusive gag reel. Perhaps the only feature worth-watching is “The Truth is Ugly: Capturing the Male and Female Point of View,” something the film tried — and failed — to do.
 The Merry Gentleman
Rating: R
Length: 110 min.
Now available
Unlike its title, this intense indie drama is anything but merry.
The Merry Gentleman, which stars Michael Keaton (Batman, Beetlejuice)  and Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald (Trainspotting, Choke), first premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival to lukewarm reviews.
The film, which is Keaton’s directorial debut, follows Kate (Macdonald), a young woman who flees her abusive policeman husband and moves to Chicago. There, she meets Frank, a depressed hired killer, and the two kindred spirits find themselves connected almost instantly. As their connection grows, the pair must come to terms with who they are and what their lives have become.
The DVD is released in widescreen format.

Ask anyone what first comes to mind when they think of Los Angeles, and he or she will mention the glitz and the glam, the celebrity tabloids, Hollywood mansions and palm tree-lined freeways.
But the more experienced Angelenos might tell you a different story, one involving obscure religious organizations and spiritual sites unknown and unheard of to the public.
For $58 a ticket, the tour company Esotouric will take you on a guided bus adventure visiting these peculiar religious sites in the greater Los Angeles area.
The tour, called “Maja’s Mysteries: A Magical Excursion into Secret Los Angeles,” is one of many guided excursions offered by Esotouric, which specializes in exposing the truths about everything from rock ’n’ roll history to true crime to Raymond Chandler and Charles Bukowski.
Founded in May 2007 by a couple of UC Santa Cruz graduates, Esotouric bus adventures mix the knowledge of renowned lecturers and theorists with a few unexpected spoonfuls of fictional quirkiness to educate both newcomers and natives about the rich culture of a city too often dismissed as superficial and soulless.
“Maja’s Mysteries” began in Downtown Los Angeles at Clifton’s Cafeteria on the corner of 7th Street and Broadway where a small woman named Chinta wrote out the nametags of passengers (or as the guides call them, “gentle riders”) and instructed everyone to board the bus. The diverse and eager crowd consisted of everybody from tattoo-covered gothic couples wearing black capes and colorful wigs to curious preteens craving an adventure.
A blond-haired woman then boarded the bus wearing four-inch platform shoes with white spandex and introduced herself as Maja D’Aoust, a librarian, lecturer and teacher of Manly P. Hall’s Philosophical Research Society —  and the tour guide for the day.
D’Aoust was born and raised on a small island off the coast of Washington called Vashon, which has a large community of artists interested in counter culture and alternative religions.
Her interest in spirituality began after she read religious books on theory and art from around the world given to her by her mother, which lead her to pursue degrees in biochemistry, oriental medicine and transformational psychology with a focus on shamanism.
“I was pretty much surrounded by images of Tibetan Buddhism, Vedic Myths, Christian renaissance art, pagan and Greek myths and many other forms of the material through the form of art and symbol,” she said in a later interview.
D’Aoust first became involved with the Esotouric company two years ago and has previously hosted two other tours.
She is among many tour guides selected by Esotouric founders Kim Cooper and Richard Schave, including acclaimed novelists, critics and a creepy, grease-painted clown named Crimebo.
As the bus headed north toward its first destination, D’Aoust explained the influence of magic in spiritual history — how hope is the basis of consciousness in the material world and how our ability to be tricked by simple magical illusions is representative of the entire universe as a deception.
Many of these theories were supported by controversial occultist, Aleister Crowley, who wrote The Book of the Law — which would later become the basis for the organization Ordo Templi Orietis, and, coincidentally, the first stop on the tour.
Located in the basement of a dry cleaning service in La Crescenta, the OTO Star Sapphire Lodge was composed of two rooms — a library of magical writings and a more secluded area of velvet curtains, checkerboard floors and drippy candles lit during a procession in front of the inquisitive gentle riders.
The members are mostly men, but the organization is led by a woman named Sorar Sophia, who demonstrated a ritual known as a “banishing.”
The ceremony began with her facing the sun and folding her fingers in the shape of a triangle before shouting Greek adorations to OTO aspirants.
Once completed, all members of the OTO chanted, “Love is the law, love under will,” before retreating behind the curtains and guiding us to our seats in the back room for a reading from The Book of the Law.
Concerning the OTO’s rule that all members must be older than 18, Sophia stated they didn’t want any “problems with liability.” Perhaps this has something to do with the nine steps of initiation, which include at the very end a practice known as “sex magic,” which Crowley described as the release of sexual arousal or energy accompanied by a mental image of a desired result.
Crowley believed that sex was the supreme magical power and as a result, included it in the OTO’s inception and manifestation. Sophia said the initiation process of the OTO often takes years to complete and many of its members have not yet reached the ninth step of sex magic.
After the bus left the OTO and professional magician Jeff Parks performed for a half-hour inside a train station that inspired several Raymond Chandler novels, the adventure bus headed back to Downtown where Maja’s magical bus riders took a tour of the landmark 1927 Theosophy Hall before heading back home.  The fancy architectural structure is home to three floors of study rooms, an intricate library and a large auditorium where services are held — all of this only a few blocks from the USC campus on 33rd Street and Grand Avenue.
D’Aoust compared Los Angeles as a spiritual territory with other US cities, saying that magic can be found everywhere in Hollywood — even in its name.
“In olden times magic wands were made from Holly wood [from the Holly tree] and it’s no coincidence that Hollywood waves a spell of illusion over the rest of the world,” she said.
Thanks to D’Aoust and Esotouric, the complexities of this magic can be fully explored and discussed with “gentle riders” looking for an adventure slightly off the beaten path.

As universities across the country show an increase in cases of the H1N1 virus, studies show students, who fall under the highest risk group for contracting the virus, are among the least likely to seek out the vaccination.
Reported cases of the swine flu have increased in college students over the past few weeks.
Skeptical · A student speaks with a health official at last week’s flu shot clinic at the Lyon Center. Many students are choosing not to get flu shots. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
During the week ending Oct. 30, there were 9,128 new cases of swine flu at universities across the country that report to the American College Health Association, indicating a 2 percent increase in new cases from the previous week. At reporting universities in California, there were 394 new cases.
Despite this increase, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey shows that while nearly 70 percent of the population wants the H1N1 vaccine, in young adults the numbers drop to about 40 percent. A Washington Post-ABC news poll also found that nearly seven out of 10 people in the 18-to-29 age group said they did not plan to get vaccinated.
There are many different theories surrounding the reasons why students who fall under the CDC priority group do not see the importance of getting vaccinated. Health officials said an attitude of invincibility is one of the major factors for the low levels of college students getting the vaccine.
“I don’t really get sick very often and I’m a healthy guy,” said Scott Sternad, a junior majoring in civil engineering (building science), who was not planning to get the vaccine. “I feel like if I did get [the swine flu] I’d be able to fight it off.”
Others have also attributed past experience with the seasonal flu as reasons to forgo the new vaccine.
“I’ve never gotten a flu shot and I’ve never gotten the flu, so I don’t see a reason to get [the H1N1 vaccine],” said Serena Virani, a freshman majoring in psychology.
Such views could be problematic, according to Dr. Jeff Goad, director of student outreach for community health and an associate professor at the School of Pharmacy, since students are not major targets for the seasonal flu, which usually affects the elderly and people with pre-existing health conditions.
College students are, however, among the highest risk group for contracting the H1N1 virus, because their immune systems have not been exposed to a similar strain of the virus that spread in the 1970s, according to Amanda Aldridge, a spokeswoman for the CDC.
But the problem is not simply in students’ attitudes. Some students who said they want to get vaccinated can’t do so because the vaccine is in short supply and students can end up waiting in line for hours for a shot.
“If there was an easy opportunity to get [the vaccine], I would,” said Scott Macklin, a junior majoring in astronautics and space technology.
According to Dr. Lawrence Neinstein, executive director of the University Park Health Center, the university received only enough doses to vaccinate 10 percent or less of the student body, which led to lines and long waits on days the vaccination was offered for free.
Neinstein added in an email, that the school has given about 800 doses to students so far.
Additionally, the media has also played a role in influencing students’ decision to get vaccinated. Aldridge said the media’s treatment of the disease was a possible reason students doubt the threat of the flu.
“The swine flu doesn’t seem like a serious issue,” said Ryan Madsen, a junior majoring in business administration.
Some students have also become wary of the vaccine after hearing stories about some people who have had severe negative reactions to the vaccine.
“I don’t feel comfortable putting [the vaccine] in my body,” said Chandler Rabens, a sophomore majoring in communication. “The shot hasn’t been out long enough to see the side effects.”
Health professionals are working to counter widespread false information regarding the safety of the vaccination, Neinstein added.
“In 10 million doses of the vaccine there has not been one serious complication,” Neinstein wrote.
Other officials added that the benefits of being protected outweighed the risk of getting sick, saying it is especially important to get the vaccine for better protection, since students live in close quarters.
“Getting vaccinated now can help [students] in the future,” Goad said. “This is likely to be the new flu and we will be living with it for years.”
But what about the cost of it as well? We can’t all afford that. Plus, as you even mentioned, there is not enough of the vaccine to go around, so how would that even work out?

As most seniors plan their schedules in preparation for their last semester, some seniors are looking for jobs and getting ready for graduation.
“If you’re done, you’re done,” said Gabe Bucsko, a senior majoring in cinema-television production. “The only reason I would stay is if I was scared.”
Bucsko is graduating a semester early — a choice that is becoming increasingly common at USC.
In four years, the number of students graduating early has grown steadily, increasing from 6.9 percent to 9.1 percent, according to Ray Gonzales, director of research and reporting for the Office of Academic Records and Registrar.
Gonzales could not point to any one factor that has led to this increase, though he said the economy likely has played a role.
“The economy — it’s definitely a confusing time for us,” Gonzales said. “We don’t have the same economic climate as in previous years.”
Gene Bickers, vice provost for undergraduate programs, said the reason for graduating early varies from student to student.
Some, like Bucsko, are choosing to leave early to save money. Though the job market is daunting, Bucsko said he’d rather try to get a job than pay for an unnecessary semester of school.
“It’s not the best time to be going into any industry, really,” Bucsko said. “But I want to get a job — I have an internship right now that will hopefully turn into something.”
Maryann Wu, an assistant director of undergraduate advisement in the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, said she has seen more students wanting to graduate early in recent years.
But Wu, who graduated a year early from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, said she would rather have stayed in college longer.
“During the time I was at Miami, I didn’t know why I was in such a rush, and I wish I would have spent my four years to pick up another major or minor or study abroad,” Wu said.
Wu speculated that more students might be graduating early because it’s becoming increasingly common for students to bring in a lot of transfer credits earned through Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate scores.
Michael Saleeb, a senior majoring in political science and communication, said it was easy for him to graduate a semester early because of all the AP credits he earned from high school.
“Originally, I was going to graduate in three years, but I had to pick up another degree in order to have enough credits to graduate from the university,” Saleeb said.
Saleeb said he recommends that students understand what their options are in terms of class selection and course requirements if they want to graduate early.
Katie Reid, a senior majoring in theatre, said she is graduating in December because she took the maximum number of units per semester for the semesters she’s been at USC and because she planned her course schedule well.
“I didn’t go into college planning to graduate early, but because I planned my semesters ahead of time and took the classes I needed to take instead of wasting my units, I was able to graduate a semester early,” Reid said.
Reid said she already has a job lined up for January from a previous internship. She said she thinks her early graduation may have made it less competitive for her to find a job.
“The weakened economy has made it super-competitive,” Reid said. “I don’t think I have as much competition because there are fewer graduates in December, and most of the recent graduates with whom I’m competing are from May 2009.”
Wu said some of her students choose to graduate early to get a leg up on the job market competition, among other advantages.
“The pros of graduating early include saving money, getting a head start on the job market and having more time to prepare for graduate school,” Wu said.
But Wu said it was important to note that every student has a different situation — the bottom line was to help students pursue their interests at USC.
“USC has so much to offer and it’s important to make the most of your experience here,” Wu said.

In less than two years, 15 USC start-up companies have raised about $115 million in financing for their businesses, as a result of the efforts by the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation.
The numbers, announced at First Look LA — an investor event held in conjunction with UCLA and Caltech — represent the work of the university-wide institute, which was designed to harness the creative thinking and innovative work of all of USC’s 17 professional schools. The institute, based in the Office of the Provost, promotes entrepreneurship through competitions, investor events and providing resources for students.
Innovation · Students display their creative research at last year’s Undergraduate Symposium for Scholarly and Creative Work. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“The impressive funding activity of USC spinoffs is especially interesting when considering the current economic climate,” said Elisa Wiefel Schreiber, director of communications for the institute.
A report released by Dow Jones VentureSource last month called 2009 the worst investment year since 2003, and start-ups across the country have seen a significant drop in venture capital over the past year.
As a result, the Stevens Institute has focused on
helping the start-ups tap other sources of funding — including private investors, overseas investors and government grants.
Schreiber added that the fundraising success of the companies could be an indication of their future potential.
“These investments are fueling new businesses that are poised to make an ongoing impact in the next decade through new products and job creation,” Schreiber said.
The institute aims to help develop the innovator as well as the work on the company itself, by utilizing educational programs,
community-building events and showcase opportunities, according to Schreiber.
“[The showcase opportunities] in turn provides a central connection for industries seeking cutting edge innovations in which to invest,” Schreiber said.
One of the 15 start-ups, BigStage — a technology company for interactive entertainment developers — was recently ranked 18th out of 20 in Forbes magazine’s list of America’s Most Promising Companies, and has raised more than $10 million within the last two years, according to their
website. Other companies in the list include Box.net, a content-sharing platform and Flixya.com, a video sharing website with ad revenue for users.
The institute does not actively participate in the fundraising process or distribute funds to the start-ups, Schreiber said. A license to a patent is given to an entrepreneur, which then creates a business around that patent and seeks their own funding resources, although the institute does provide assistance and advice in how to go about the process.
“The credit goes to our start-ups for their resourcefulness in raising funds from creative sources during these tough times and building innovative companies that can attract these investments in the first place,” Schreiber said. “We can only encourage, coach and connect; the real heavy lifting in this economy is being done by the entrepreneurs themselves.”
According to Schreiber, the success of these companies is a validation from the private sector of the quality of the research at USC and an early indicator of USC’s new strategic focus on the innovation process through the institute.
“Having the USC Stevens Institute creates a ‘halo effect’ for USC,” said Schreiber. “It’s something the students can be proud of and see as an indicator that USC is competitive with institutions such as the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and other innovative universities.”
Students said they were inspired by the success of the companies, and were pleased to know there was an on-campus resource for those planning to start their own companies.
“This is a great opportunity to expose students to these possibilities that are out there,” said Hugh Garvey, a freshman majoring in business administration. “These numbers lay a solid foundation for the future — it makes me optimistic.”
Elton Kwok, a sophomore majoring in civil engineering, also expressed enthusiasm about the institute.
“Seeing this success makes me excited and motivated to strive harder and follow in their footsteps to create my own business,” Kwok said. “This sets a precedent which says it can be done.”
