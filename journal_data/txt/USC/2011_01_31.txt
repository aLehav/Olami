Students have started to check out movies from DVD Rental Stations in New/North and the Pardee Tower lobbies, as movies were put in the weekend before last.
The stations, which were added over winter break, came as part of a USG initiative from USG President Chris Cheng’s platform. Movies cost $2 per night to rent and a credit card is required to check one out.

“It’s nice having it there because a lot of time we want to watch movies in the dorms, and it has a lot of brand new releases,” said Jessyka Linton, a freshman majoring in political science who lives in the South side. “I’m excited to start renting movies from it. Hopefully it’ll also start taking USC IDs instead of debit cards in the future, because that’d make it more convenient.”
Tim Sae Koo, USG Director of Student Affairs, coordinated the effort with USC Housing.
“Our President and Vice President [Nehi Ogbevoen] ran with the platform that was to put one in each side of campus — Southside, New/North, Parkside and the West side, Webb and Fluor — in central locations there to make them accessible to all students living on campus,” Sae Koo said.
During the 2009-10 school year, there was a rental station in New/North, which was taken out last semester because of renovations.
“During winter break, they installed one in Pardee and Marks and one in New/North,” Sae Koo said. “Right now, they are seeing how well the response is. If it’s positive, USC housing will go from there, based on student feedback, to put one in Parkside and one in the Westside.”
Cheng said he was excited to see this part of his platform put into effect.
“Our goal is always to make student life here convenient and enjoyable and to enhance the student experience,” Cheng said. “There are Redboxes at supermarkets —  there’s one at the Ralphs for students who live off-campus —  but there weren’t any convenient places for freshmen to go.”
Sae Koo said that this was just one example of USG working with USC administration to improve student life.

Former USC defensive end Everson Griffen was tased and apprehended by LAPD after assaulting an officer at a traffic stop near USC’s campus at around 4 p.m. Monday.
Police officers were performing a routine traffic stop at the intersection of 30th and Hoover Streets when they pulled Griffen over.
He did not have a valid ID on him and became aggressive when questioned by officers, according to an LAPD spokesperson. Griffen attempted to run away and then assaulted one of the officers who was pursuing him.
The officers tased Griffen, then arrested him on a charge of felony battery.
Griffen, who was selected by the Minnesota Vikings with the 100th overall pick in last April’s NFL Draft, had been on campus earlier in the day to visit coaches and players.
As a junior, Griffen recorded 45 tackles for the Trojans before giving up his final season of eligibility to declare for the draft.
During his first season with the Vikings, the former five-star recruited appeared in 11 games, recording 11 tackles. Minnesota finished just 6-10 overall.
Monday was not Griffen’s first run-in with the law.
On July 4, 2009, Griffen, along with former USC linebacker Jordan Campbell, was cited by the Nantucket Police Department for a noise violation at a party.
Neither Griffen nor Campbell was reprimanded by the university. They were, however, asked to write letters of apology.
why did he run? was he drinking, had drugs on him. He need to make better decisions in tight situations. Now he is just in worse trouble.
Somethings just never seem to change.  They just have to learn the hard way.  Somehow, I don’t think this will be the last time he makes the wrong choice with law enforcement.

Thomas undecided in commitment to USC
Despite his verbal commitment, five-star recruit De’Anthony Thomas (Crenshaw, Calif.) is reportedly wavering in his decision to play for USC next year.
Thomas told Scott Schrader of FightOn247.com on Monday that he will announce his final decision Wednesday at a 5 p.m. press conference to be held at L.A. Live’s ESPN Zone.
“Tell everyone to come out for the announcement,” Thomas told Schrader.
Thomas, ranked No. 5 in the Rivals100, visited the University of Oregon this weekend, a move that has left USC with some unanswered questions.
The tailback from Crenshaw High is verbally committed to the Trojans, but until National Signing Day Feb. 2, he could switch his commitment to any other team.
Though the Trojans are still under sanctions, their Jan. 22 appeal meant that the restrictions on recruiting have not yet kicked in.
USC coach Lane Kiffin has 25 verbal commitments, including Thomas, and USC’s recruiting class is ranked No. 5 in the nation according to Rivals.com.
While Thomas might or might not still join the team next year, the Trojans’ other five-star recruit, George Farmer, is reportedly steady in his decision to play for USC.

Turene decommits
Kent Turene’s (Lauderdale Lakes, Fla.) verbal commitment to the Trojans has been uncertain for some time, but now it’s official that he has decommitted from USC.
Now, the three-star linebacker is considering Nebraska, Texas Tech and Georgia, in addition to USC.
“Nobody is leading right now,” Turene said. “I’m just making sure that I am doing the right thing for me.”
Turene initially had committed to USC last July, but now says he will make his decision Wednesday on National Signing Day.
“I want to do this the right way and respect the process,” Turene said. “I want to make sure I’m making the right decision and I want all the programs that are recruiting me to understand where everything stands.”

Gomez and Troy recognized for strong play
Murphy Troy of the men’s volleyball team and Emilio Gomez of the men’s tennis team were named USC Credit Union Student-Athletes of the Week.
The senior opposite hitter helped lead the No. 1 Trojans to two more road victories against No. 6 UC Santa Barbara and No. 4 UCLA.
In a sweep against the Gauchos, Troy hit .632 and finished with 12 kills. Against the Bruins, Troy had a match-best 26 kills to go along with five aces and seven digs.
Troy’s play has been instrumental in USC’s 6-0 start, which is its best since 1994.
The freshman Gomez has been off to a perfect start as he has opened his college career with a 4-0 mark in singles play and a 5-0 record in doubles play.
In matches against Florida State, San Diego State and Indiana, the freshman came away with three singles and three doubles victories, helping the Trojans to a 5-0 start on the year.
For his stellar play, Gomez was also named Pac-10 Player of the Week.

USC men’s water polo coach Jovan Vavic was named National Coach of the Year Monday, becoming the first coach ever to receive the award in three consecutive seasons.
Vavic was presented with the honor following his team’s third-straight NCAA title this past December.
USC is the first program to accomplish such a feat since 1980.
Winning tradition · USC coach Jovan Vavic has coached the Trojans for 16 years and compiled a 367-61 (.857) record during his tenure. - Daily Trojan file photo 
“It’s satisfying when your peers recognize that you are doing a good job,” Vavic said. “The credit goes to my players and assistant coaches, big time. The head coach gets the credit, but it’s the people behind the scenes who make this program really successful.”
Vavic has won the award for the men’s team and the ninth time altogether, as he also won the award for coaching the women’s team on three occasions.
In his 16th year, the Trojans’ coach led the team in was, in many ways, a rebuilding year, after many stand-out seniors graduated from the 2009 championship team.
His team quickly dispelled that notion, as it won every tournament it entered this past season, and downed California 12-10 in overtime in Berkeley, Calif. to secure its sixth national championship under Vavic’s watch.
Although a little premature, a fourth consecutive National Coach of the Year award might soon follow, as the Trojans are returning virtually every starter from this year’s team. In fact, Vavic believes that this is the most formidable the water polo program has been during his tenure.
“The last few years we have really established ourselves as the measuring stick for many of these other teams,” Vavic said. “I would definitely say that we have never been stronger. As a matter of fact, it looks like we are going to have the No. 1 recruiting class in the nation again.”
Unsurprisingly, Vavic enjoys little downtime. Amid signing players for his men’s water polo team, Vavic is preparing the women’s water polo team to defend its national title as well.
The Women of Troy’s season begins this Saturday at the Stanford Invitational, commencing Vavic’s  quest for yet another NCAA title.

Recruiting is the lifeblood of every college football program.
With national signing day coming up Wednesday, prepare to hear the recruiting news spewing across every sports media platform.
You’ll hear which team has the best incoming class, which teams missed out, which teams did the best at what positions and so on.
Your appetite for arbitrary rankings — a specialty of college football — will be satisfied.
You’ll hear who Rivals.com says got the top class and who landed the most of ESPNU’s top 150 players.
You’ll be seeing stars, likely three, four and five at a time.
My advice: Do not get too excited one way or the other.
In fact, you would be better off dismissing the ridiculous rundowns of rankings as soon as you hear them.
Everyone will tell you recruiting is inexact, especially in football.
In sports like basketball, where one individual can have a much greater impact, the odds are much better. Kids sometimes start getting recruited as early as middle school.
If a basketball player has the size and the skill set, chances are he’ll pan out at whichever college he chooses (and then, of course, jump ship to the NBA after one season).
Or, at least, there’s a greater chance the basketball player will pan out than a football recruit who seems to have the same level of qualifications; so many factors always weigh in.
There is greater competition for playing time, which usually means a longer delay before seeing action. Plus, football is so much more of a physical game that top recruits sometimes either cannot keep up or are derailed by injuries.
These recruiting misses are not limited to one sport.
But they don’t seem to stick out as much in other sports as in college football, primarily because of the frenzy that accompanies each recruiting cycle.
Hindsight will always reveal each year’s booms and busts. ESPN.com just took a rear-view mirror look at the class of 2007 and, not surprisingly, the discrepancy between the rankings then and how the players actually panned out is huge.
USC landed 10 of ESPNU’s 150, which gave the Trojans the honor of being named the top recruiting class that year.
Then-coach Pete Carroll landed the top three prospects in the nation: running back Joe McKnight (No. 1), linebacker Chris Galippo (No. 2) and running back Marc Tyler (No. 3). The class also included quarterback Aaron Corp (No. 33) and receiver Ronald Johnson (No. 47).
In 2007, you would have thought that by grabbing the two top running backs and the top linebacker, the Trojans would be primed for greatness on both sides of the ball by now.
But you never know which way the football will bounce.
McKnight was a solid presence in USC’s backfield, yet despite his ability, he never emerged as a game-changing player.
The New York Jets selected him in the fourth round in last year’s draft, but his USC career ended far below expectations.
Galippo struggled with injuries early in his career, then was a Butkus Award semifinalist in 2009 before losing his starting spot for part of 2010 and finishing the season with 29 tackles.
Galippo could still redeem himself with a breakout season in 2011.
Tyler came into USC with a broken ankle and then battled more injuries, but he is coming off his best and most complete season.
As a result, he could be set for a big 2011, when he will almost certainly be the featured running back.
Then there’s Corp, formerly known as the fifth-best quarterback recruit in the country.
He lost the starting job to then-freshman Matt Barkley, had an awful performance in his only start of the year and then ingloriously transferred to Richmond.
Meanwhile, Cam Newton, who began his career at Florida, was ranked No. 58 by ESPNU.
Sure, it took him a few transfers and a little fatherly direction to land at Auburn, but you can’t argue with a Heisman trophy and a national title.
You get the point by now.
No matter what hype a kid brings to his college campus, there is no guarantee he’ll pan out on the field.
Forty-yard dash times and high school touchdown totals lead to scholarships, but they don’t necessarily amount to success.
That being said, USC’s prospective recruiting class is currently ranked No. 5 in the nation by Rivals.com, No. 6 by Scout.com and No. 4 by ESPN. And the Trojans’ class includes eight ESPNU150 signees.

The courting of high school prep stars culminates Wednesday with National Signing Day, when prospects from around the country will sign their letters of intent and fax them to their future schools.
By signing the letter, student-athletes are bound to attend the university with which they sign.
Can’t be stopped · Despite NCAA sanctions, USC coach Lane Kiffin has managed to gain several committments from top-notch recruits for the 2011-2012 football season. - Daily Trojan file photo 
In return, the athletes are guaranteed financial aid.
On June 11, 2010, the NCAA handed down scholarship restrictions against USC allowing it to only carry 75 scholarship players over the course of three seasons.
These penalties, however, have yet to take effect because of the school’s pending appeal, creating some confusion as to how many players the Trojans can actually sign Wednesday.
The USC coaching staff has not revealed its exact strategy for the 2011 recruiting class.
On the one hand, USC coach Lane Kiffin could sign a full class of 25 and build up the roster to maximum strength before the penalties begin.
On the other hand, it is possible he could sign 20 players and hope the appeal is successful. In the latter scenario, 2011 would be the first year USC would serve its three-year reduction.
In the face of sanctions, Lane Kiffin and his staff, nonetheless, have solicited several commitments from high-ranking prospects.
According to Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com, the Trojans possess the fifth-best recruiting class in the country with 17 verbal commitments in addition to the eight who have already officially signed letters of intent.
Notable commitments include wide receivers George Farmer (Gardena, Calif.) and Victor Blackwell (Santa Ana, Calif.), defensive end Greg Townsend, Jr. (Beverly Hills, Calif.), defensive tackle Antwaun Woods (Woodland Hills, Calif.) and athlete De’Anthony Thomas (Los Angeles).
USC is currently tied with four other schools for the second most five-star commitments.
Only LSU, who has three five-star players, has more.
Last year, USC closed with a fury as some top undecided prospects chose the Trojans.
With several uncommitted prospects still on the board, the Trojans could pick up some very talented players Wednesday.
Five-star offensive lineman La’El Collins (Baton Rouge, Louis.), four-star guard Aundrey Walker (Cleveland, Ohio) and four-star offensive tackle Troy Niklas (Anaheim, Calif.) are among some of the top names that could land at USC.
Despite the job the coaching staff has done, the last 48 hours have shown how fragile a recruiting class truly is.
Over the weekend, three-star linebacker Kent Turene (Lauderdale Lakes, Fla.) decommitted from USC and re-opened his recruitment.
Sunday night, rumors swirled that highly prized five-star athlete De’Anthony Thomas (Crenshaw High) is considering switching his longtime pledge to USC in favor of Oregon.
yea duck losers..not only can you NEVER win the big game and bring home ANY real hardware, your also too stupuid to know that USC never paid a dime to Bush. but you did go to that lowley rated joke of an academic school in Eugene, so your stupidity is not a surprise. I have never seen such a jealous fearful insecure buch as I see in Oregon fans…lol!!!
VICTORY!!!!
School of cheaters?  How easily you forget about your crooked QB stealing laptops, how your RB punches apposing players, how your other RB punches his girlfriend, etc.  Ducks apparently lack long term memory… Where would you be without Phil Knight?!  You’d be Oregon State.  Once Phil is gone, good luck!!  Fight On!!!
The school of the cheaters! How much will your kid take to come play for my program? GO DUCKS!!!
GO DUCKS!

Late last week, Tim Gunn, the Chief Creative Officer of Liz Claiborne, Inc., cancelled his keynote speech for the Career Fair, which was supposed to take place at Bovard on Thursday.
Tim Gunn, well known as an on-air fashion mentor for Project Runway, is also the Honorary Chair of Fashion Design at Parson’s New School for Design. Thanks to Gunn’s direction, Parsons now has one of the leading fashion design programs in the world. His widely-published interviews, articles and TV appearances have made him a fashion guru.
Jeep Hauser, Director of IT & Communications at USC’s Career Center, is in charge of coordinating this year’s Career Fair. He said Gunn had to cancel for a conflicting speaking appearance.
“He will be on Oprah this Thursday,” Hauser said.
According to Hauser, the fashionisto was deeply apologetic and asked if he could come to speak next semester.
Students previously looking forward to attending the sold-out event are disappointed.
Tess Goodwin, the VP of membership for the Fashion Industry Association here at USC, said she was the first in line when the speaker was announced.
“Even if you don’t know anything about fashion, you’ve heard of Tim Gunn because of Project Runway. When I heard he was coming I was really excited,” Goodwin said. “It was an event that I felt really passionate about going to.”
So far Tim Gunn’s slot has not been filled, and organizers say it is too late to find another relevant speaker for Thursday evening.

Out of all the award shows in existence, the Oscars is probably the most anticipated.
Yet the announcement of the 83rd annual Academy Award nominations last week came about just as critics predicted, with only a few, not very notable exceptions.
Winter’s Bone filled what some saw as the wild card slot in the 10-film Best Picture category. In addition, the indie film’s John Hawkes got an unexpected nod for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.
Javier Bardem snagged a spot in the Lead Actor category for his role in Biutiful, beating out Blue Valentine’s much praised Ryan Gosling.
And while Christopher Nolan’s dream-within-a-dream psychological thriller Inception was nominated for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay, Nolan himself was snubbed for Best Director.
Overall, this awards season has been predictable. If all goes according to plan, Natalie Portman will take home Best Actress for Black Swan, Colin Firth will win Best Actor for The King’s Speech and The Fighter’s Christian Bale and Melissa Leo will take the Supporting Actor and Actress categories.
With its Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay nominations, Toy Story 3 has little chance of losing Best Animated Feature.
The King’s Speech could pull out ahead, considering its recent slew of wins including the recent Screen Actors Guild Awards.
The real drama on Oscar night will be the battle between The King’s Speech and The Social Network, which has officially kicked into high gear during the last week and a half.
Starting with an unexpected win at the Producers Guild Awards Jan. 22nd, The King’s Speech has won the highest honor from each of the various guilds, including an upset win for director Tom Hooper at the Directors Guild Awards and Outstanding Cast at Sunday’s SAG Awards.
With 12 nominations, it received the most Oscar nods of any film this year, while The Social Network tied with Inception for third at eight nominations each. The King’s Speech is starting to look unbeatable.
But wait a minute. Wasn’t The Social Network the infallible film of the year?
It started awards season by receiving top honors from practically every major critics association, from Los Angeles, New York, the National Board of Review and countless others. The film also earned Golden Globes in the Best Picture, Director and Screenplay categories. Upon its October release, David Fincher’s film about the founding of Facebook was hailed as the film that defined the “Facebook generation,” as we are sadly called. It was heralded by almost every major media outlet as the best film of the year. Have people simply lost enthusiasm for the film in  the last three months?
Even with The King’s Speech’s PGA win, many thought that Fincher, whose painstaking precision at the helm of The Social Network is evident in every scene, had a lock on the Best Director award. In fact, the DGA has predicted the Oscar winner in that category for all but six years of the DGA’s existence since 1948.
The last time the Academy differed from the DGA was in 2002, when Rob Marshall took home the DGA Award for Chicago but Roman Polanski won the Oscar for The Pianist.
Even with the guild’s good track record and Hooper’s upset win, Fincher’s uncanny ability to render scenes of people sitting before computers oddly thrilling could still be recognized by the Academy.
The Producers Guild of America is a less consistent prognosticator, but it has predicted the Best Picture winner for the last three years. Interestingly, the PGA gave this year’s David O. Selznik Achievement Award to The Social Network and True Grit producer Scott Rudin, the first producer in more than 30 years to have two Best Picture nominees.
The race between The Social Network and The King’s Speech pits Rudin against fellow Oscar behemoth Harvey Weinstein, who executive produced the historical drama.
Both The Social Network and The King’s Speech should be boring films. One is about a moody king receiving speech therapy and the other is about a moody computer wiz making a website.
But ultimately, the first is an uplifting tale of overcoming adversity to lead a nation in need, while the latter emerges as a cynically accurate portrayal of this generation’s technology-induced isolation.
Whether the winner Feb. 27 reveals something about the American zeitgeist or simply reminds us which film had a later release date, the Best Picture race is the one to watch.

Black Dub, the new musical project of Daniel Lanois and Trixie Whitley, might have gestated from a chance alignment of like-minded souls in the right place at the right time, but one can’t ignore its tangible strength.
Like family · Trixie Whitley’s relationship with her fellow Black Dub bandmates dates back two decades and creates a palpable chemistry. - Photo courtesy of Gihan Salem 
The partnership between Whitley, a 23-year-old blues artist, and Lanois, a multi-instrumentalist and renowned producer for U2 and Neil Young, unfolds like a musical fairy tale 20 years in the making.
As the daughter of the late Chris Whitley, a blues-rock guitarist with deep roots in the music world, the soundtrack to Whitley’s childhood spanned several genres.
She remembers hearing everything from soul to West African tunes to blues musician Muddy Waters, and singing along to the funk-psychedelia of Sly and the Family Stone.
“I wasn’t very aware of my voice as a kid. I always sang, but it wasn’t like I necessarily wanted to become a singer. But I absorbed everything I listened to,” Whitley said. “And, you know, being around my dad as a kid, it’s undeniable that his voice soaked into my skin.”
Her father also introduced her to a variety of musicians. One of them was Lanois, whom Whitley met when she was three years old during her father’s 1991 recording sessions for his track “Living with the Law.”
“My dad just got signed to Columbia [Records] and he recorded his first record at Dan’s studio, which was at his house in New Orleans. I lived at the house for about a year,” Whitley said. “Oddly enough, I was around all the people that Dan still works with, like the engineers and [jazz musician] Daryl Johnson. They were changing my diapers.”
Despite getting in some hours behind a drum set as a child, musicianship remained on the back-burner for Whitley.
At age 12, she traveled to Europe with a professional acting troupe, which later led to a stint in an eclectic modern dance company. It was through dance that Whitley reconnected with music.
“Dance and music are very similar, because how I relate very much to music is rhythmically, and rhythm is something that really runs through your body,” Whitley said. “I’m very much aware that that’s how I create my music, even vocally, and perform.”
But it was not until age 17 when Whitley, splitting her time between Belgium and the United States, decided to settle in New York City, delving into songwriting and making it the focal point of her life.
Writing and producing EPs and waitressing to pay the bills, Whitley decided to visit her mother in Belgium.
While she was there, the two attended a festival featuring a performance with Lanois. Although 20 years had passed since their last meeting, Whitley says Lanois instantly remembered her when she popped backstage for a quick greeting.
Two weeks after the festival, Whitley received a call from Lanois inviting her to the Berklee College of Music, where Lanois held an artist-in-residency position. Lanois and Whitley, along with drummer Brian Blade, recorded a demo of Whitley’s, “I’d Rather Go Blind,” more for experimentation than anything else.
“Nothing was really clear. I had no idea what I was going to be doing in Boston besides meeting him and hearing what he had to say,” Whitley said. “That first recording session was a big leap into understanding that we were really able to work together.”
The recording session at Berklee led to another in Toronto, where Johnson joined the trio and produced “I Believe in You.”
Although Whitley says she and Lanois approach songwriting differently — she takes an autobiographical approach while Lanois crafts stories around fictional people and events — the pair found harmony in their blues sensibility.
“Despite not knowing Dan personally for 20 years, he and his music were always such a big part of my life. The first songs I started writing were to his ambient instrumental records,” Whitley said. “It felt like a long-lost friend that I found again, even though we didn’t really know each other. It always felt like family — like I was home.”
But that home, like her memories of Lanois’ musical safe haven in New Orleans, is bittersweet for Whitley.
The memory of her father and his legacy still linger as she fervently crafts her own music.
“It’s quite a trip finding that balance and embracing that family history, but also trying to break free,” Whitley said. “I’m definitely not the type of person who would try to use [my family history] at all. I’m really trying to have my own identity and not step in the same footsteps of my father.”
Still, Whitley believes that emotionally, her relationship with Lanois “was a lot more complex than it would be without such a close background.”
Indeed, the aural evidence of that background makes Black Dub thrilling to listen to, as emotionally charged as it is technically compelling.

Oops. Michael Cardenas did it again.
It’s only been two years since he opened the hit restaurant Lazy Ox Canteen, named 2010’s Best New Restaurant by Angeleno Magazine.
Now, enter Cardenas’ latest project, Aburiya Toranoko, which made its debut last Wednesday, right next door to Lazy Ox at San Pedro Street. Apparently, there are at least two more projects on the way.
Sophia Lee and Murugappah Aroonachalam | Daily Trojan
Cardenas’ plan is clear — turn downtown into a hot, sizzling gastronomical sensation.
Cardenas has found success in all the haute cuisine areas in Los Angeles as head of the Innovative Dining Group, which conceptualized and owns high-scene, celeb-spotting restaurants such as Sushi Roku and BOA Steakhouse.
But he takes a different approach downtown.
Like Lazy Ox, Toranoko is considerably downscaled. Squeezed underneath a Little Tokyo condo complex, Toranoko is compact and inconspicuous, yet evokes an unaffected elegance.
The atmosphere is banquet- hall-meets-izakaya, a Japanese after-work drinking place. The narrow, rectangular dining room squishes an open sushi bar against the back wall, while several tables are pushed together in the middle of the room to form a long strip of canteen-style eating surfaces.
The communal buzz at Toranoko mixed with dim lighting and flickering candles makes one expect to be seated on tatami mats and sip sake next to akachōchin the traditional red lantern of all izakayas.
Yet the brick walls, splattered with brilliant graffiti art by local artist Prime, and the mural behind the sushi bar, boldly painted by local tattoo artist Jiro, lend Toranoko a sublime balance of humble and hip.
The menu is reflective of Toranoko’s creative image. Many dishes could be found on a typical izakaya menu, but are slightly retooled with new ingredients for different modern tastes. Everything is served tapas-style, meant to be shared between sips of Sapporo Beer or sake.
One should expect to see a few unfamiliar Japanese terms on the menu. Thankfully, everyone at Toranoko is eager to help, chef and servers alike.
The chef was also careful to emphasize that the food is “farm to table” style, meaning that all the ingredients are sustainable and appeasing to the growing “locavore” movement.
Nothing is extraneous or substandard in Toranoko’s dishes. Executive chef Hisa Kawabe and kitchen chef Taku Sugawara were both trained at Nobu Matsuhiba, and the same Nobu emphasis on simple ingredients radiating complex tastes can be found in their dishes.
Even a simple eggplant is elevated to caramelized, umami-rich candy by basting in red and white miso.
The humdrum onigiri, a rice ball familiar with school lunch boxes, is baked into a toasty, crusty shell with sticky rice filling.
If you want true izakaya cuisine, make sure to order the okonomiyaki, a fried pork and vegetable pancake that arrives sizzling on a hot plate, speckled with dancing, paper-thin bonito flakes and drizzled with Japanese mayonnaise and a thick, tangy sauce. Even the strips of pickled ginger are spectacular — sour, pungent, yet intriguingly sweet.
Still, not everything at Toranoko earns high marks.
The mountain potato fries were thick sticks that did not quite crisp up, and the plum aioli, though satisfactory, seems to be just regular aioli mixed with Chinese plum sauce.
For a tiny stack of six short potato sticks, it is hardly worth the $8, even if the ingredient quality is superb.
The same can be said for the chawanmushi, a steamed egg custard served in a small ceramic cup. Though the ingredients were fresh and flavorful, the ratio between egg and broth was questionable, resulting in a rather watery pudding.
Dessert, however, was perfect. Though the dessert menu changes daily, get the green tea pudding if available.
Light, creamy and perfectly smooth with the characteristic bittersweet notes of high-quality matcha, the pudding was a delectable finish that will tempt you to order more.
Toranoko does not just seek to send diners off patting their stomachs with glee. It titillates taste buds with edgy and luscious yet rustic food.
It brings strangers together to one table, rubbing shoulders and clinking beer cans. It instills a sense of pride in the local community and a growing excitement that downtown is experiencing a major culinary turnover.

No one would contest that USC is a competitive school. We have the academics. Most days, we have the athletics. We’re diverse, philanthropic and we boast some mean a cappella groups.
So it doesn’t quite follow that with our prominent location in California, the state that always seems to be pioneering the nation’s environmental advances, USC would fall short in sustainability.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
The Princeton Review’s Guide to 286 Green Colleges for 2010-2011 lauded select schools for their environmental awareness and commitment to clean energy. The University of Colorado at Boulder accepted its usual accolades, including props for a budget of more than $90 million for environmental research as well as a “sculptural installation of recycled materials and a highly visible wind farm.” UCLA was described as “going green from head to toe.”
USC made the cut. We might not have been as lavishly praised as UCLA, but the review cited the university’s progress and commended its strides in helping cut down Southern California’s pervasive smog.
We’re not yet competitive with the environmentally elite, but we’re aware of where we stand. In the last few years we’ve taken baby steps in the last few years toward becoming a more eco-friendly, and we’re starting to dream bigger.
The USC Office of Sustainability recently published a report chronicling USC’s greenhouse gas emissions from 2001-2009.
The office said it is important not only to keep track of the emission levels, but also for students and faculty to have access to the data and be able to make inferences between the ratings and their possible causes.
Releasing such a report — the first of its kind at USC — was undoubtedly a progressive move. The public won’t see the baseline emission numbers as flattering, but it will see them. This opens the floor for discussion, for collaboration and, hopefully, for innovation.
It can also be a source of encouragement for the environmentally conscious; the report shows that our greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by 3 percent since 2007.
USC’s drive toward sustainability isn’t just on paper. A university-wide Energy Institute was created in 2008 to explore ideas for water conservation and renewable energy, among other things.
Our college sustainability report card finally jumped to a B- last semester after a string of C+’s. And as recently as last year, the USC Board of Trustees pledged to make every building on campus LEED certified.
When this goal will actually be realized is hard to say, but it hasn’t proven to be an empty promise so far.
The Ronald Tutor Campus Center is already LEED-approved, with the School of Cinematic Arts building and the Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine hopefully following in its wake, according to the Office of Sustainability’s website.
The university is picking up speed, and there’s plenty of room for student involvement for those who want to get on board.
USC Sustainability offers green workshops and certification programs, and the numerous on-campus environmental groups, from Beyond Coal to CalPIRG, are always looking for fresh ideas.
USC is continuing to slowly increase its focus on sustainability and environmental education.
The topics are already off the back burner, and the time seems ripe for the university to make its next move.
Whether that means exploring ways to go carbon-neutral or something less traditional like installing wind turbines on the roofs of campus buildings, á la Arizona State University.
“We’ve been sort of behind the curve on sustainability issues, but we’re catching up,” Mark Bernstein, managing director of USC’s Energy Institute, told the Daily Trojan last fall.
UCLA has set a standard with an organic garden. USC has greenhouse gas emissions three percent lower than what they were four years ago. It’s not our coup de grace, but it is progress.
Soon, it might even be competitive.

From the beginning of January through the end of February, most college seniors are faced with job applications, endless phone calls and desperate Internet searches, trying to land the perfect job.
But rather than waiting for January, students should be proactive about their job searches by starting early with internships before their senior year.
Many career advisers across the country suggest that the best way to increase your chances of finding a job is to start the job search early. Students will find success if they choose to get a jump on things.
The good news is that the U.S. job market is looking up in 2011. The economic tide is turning and highly sought after companies appear to be expanding their employment opportunities.
That’s great news for Trojans. After all, part of why we come to USC is because it attracts the nation’s top employers.
Students not only want to learn how to land a good job, but also how to stick their necks out in the field as early as possible.
The Career Planning & Placement Center plays a “helper” role by providing an array of programs associated with job searching and career strategies. This week, the Career Center is hosting a week-long series of events that focus on how to be successful in the job hunting process.
Students would be remiss not to take advantage of these events.
Bottom line: If you want your ideal job, you need to start early. That means getting help from experienced professionals.
But the programs will not be the only factor in determining whether or not you do, in fact, receive that job. Taking a hands-on approach in every aspect of your job search will be that deciding factor.

The official USC twitter announced that a foursquare venue was created for President C.L. Max Nikias’ state of the school speech tomorrow.
The “President Nikias’ Address to Students”  venue has one tip, which reads, “Student Trojans, turn out for this first-of-a-kind event with USC President C. L. Max Nikias, February 1, 4 p.m. at Bovard Auditorium!”
Foursquare allows its users to “check in” to real-world places and read “tips” from people who have been there previously, and also can cross-post to Facebook or Twitter. It is available as an application for iPhones, Blackberries and Android phones, or users can post via text message.
USC is also encouraging those on Twitter to use the hashtag #uscnikias if they attend the speech.
USC made heavy use of social media during Nikias’ inauguration, holding a biweekly trivia contest on Facebook, and offering prizes through Twitter and Foursquare.

Former USC defensive end Everson Griffen was tased and apprehended by LAPD after assaulting an officer at a traffic stop near USC’s campus at around 4 p.m. Monday.
Former USC defensive end Everson Griffen was arrested near campus Monday.
Police officers were performing a traffic stop at the intersection of 30th and Hoover Streets when they pulled Griffen over. He did not have a valid I.D. on him and became aggressive when questioned by officers, according to an LAPD spokesperson. Griffen attempted to run away and then assaulted one of the officers who was pursuing him. The officers tased Griffen, then arrested him on a charge of felony battery.
Griffen, who was selected by the Minnesota Vikings with the 100th overall pick in last April’s NFL Draft, had been on campus earlier in the day to visit coaches and players.
As a junior, Griffen recorded 45 tackles for the Trojans before giving up his final season of elgibility to declare for the draft.
Monday was not Griffen’s first run-in with the law.
On July 4, 2009, Griffen, along with former USC linebacker Jordan Campbell, was cited by the Nantucket Police Department for a noise violation at a party.
The police around USC are nothing but thugs, I cant see any reason the man would want to run because of a stupid traffic violation, do you?  I bet anything they were trying to shake the guy for a few bucks by virtue of threat.

Trojans’ weekend brunch plans need no longer consist of Denny’s “moons over my hammy” or Everybody’s Kitchen’s exotic breakfast array.  Finally, USC can claim a delectable, all-day breakfast café.  Behold the rising era of Jacks N Joe.  Quaint and whimsical, this café-diner haven beckons from a backdrop of neighboring Popeyes and fast food foolishness.
Jacks N Joe is all about USC and for USC.  Opened by a 1992 USC architecture alumnus Mark Vednorz, the space is inspiring.  Over-sized utensils, prints of the Coliseum and of dogs adorn the walls, fostering the space’s creative cool.
Get ready to belabor your meal selection.  FlapJACK highlights include the peanut butter and banana covered “Pudgie Elvis”, “Totally LA” thin crepe-like cakes with berries and sweet lemon butter, and the “WTF?!” featuring an assortment of crazy pancake shapes topped with sweet cream cheese.  Yes, they’re down with college lexicon. With these quirky selections, it’s surprising that JNJ is not capitalizing on the late-night “drunchies” crowd. (JNJ hours are 7am-9pm Monday-Friday, 8am-8pm on weekends.)  Pessimists, this is not one of those places that sacrifices taste for the sake of inventive food.  Everything is as delicious as it is fun.  Also, look into the understated, delicious breakfast sandwich, “Boulder, not Denver” omelet and exotic French toasts.
Every Jacks N Joe creation is beyond exciting, inducing giddiness and Trojan spirit, which I’ll willingly admit, I live for.  Plus, it’s cheap!  Bask in proud Trojan culture over a Fight On! breakfast.  Jacks N Joe is the new happening spot.

Announced last Tuesday were the four contenders for best song: “We Belong Together” from the childhood favorite Toy Story 3, “If I Rise” from the gripping 127 Hours, “I See the Light” from the fantasy-filled Tangled and “Coming Home” from the twangy Country Strong.  
So who will take home that well-respected and highly desirable gold man we call an Oscar?  
Alas, previous winners give no indication of the chances of this year’s nominees given their eclectic nature, eliminating the option of any kind of pattern to follow.  Take for example, 2005’s “It’s Hard out Here for a Pimp” from Hustle & Flow in contrast to  2008’s “Jai Ho” from Slumdog Millionaire a fun, fast-paced Bollywood number meant for entertainment purposes and so much for emotional depth.  
But Randy Newman’s “We Belong Together” seems to be the frontrunner.  It’s characterized by upbeat horns that you can’t help but hum along to and charming lyrics regarding friendship and love.  In the endearing Toy Story fashion, the song states, “the day I met you was the luckiest day of my life and I bet you feel the same/ least I hope you do.”
 Newman won in 2001 for Monster’s, Inc. and seeing as Toy Story 3 is likely to win best animated film, this childhood classic seems to be taking the lead.  
“Coming Home” by Tom Douglas, Troy Verges and Hillary Lindsey does, however, seem to be a close contender given its emotionally charged and dramatic instrumentals as well as its relatable theme of returning home.  
In addition, this countrified number has its own unique style with some edgier pop vibes, reminiscent of Lady Antebellum that make it appeal to the masses and give it a fighting chance for the Oscars.  
“If I Rise” is calm and melodic in the typical Dido fashion but it doesn’t have much substance beneath its melancholic hymns.  “I See the Light”, on the other hand, contains sweet and fantastical romance, but it isn’t anything new, especially when comparing it to the classic Disney princess movies.  
With the end of Toy Story 3 and Randy Newman’s tried and trusted credibility as a songwriter, “We Belong Together” is likely to take it home.  Consider that when filling out those Oscar pools.

With the 2011 Sundance Film Festival over, here is a list of some of this year’s highlights.
James Franco wearing drag?  Not quite:  The soon to be Oscar host was spotted wearing a long blonde wig to a 70’s themed after party for his upcoming project Three’s Company: The Drama.  The recreation of the 70’s TV show isn’t a movie, but instead takes an analytical view at sitcoms.
The other Olsen:  Elizabeth Olsen, the Olsen twins’ younger sister, made her Sundance debut with two films.  First is the winner of U.S. dramatic directing award, Martha Marcy May Marlene, which tells the story of a woman and her struggle to cope after leaving an abusive cult.  Her second film is the psychological thriller Silent House.   She will next be featured co-staring with Robert De Niro, Signourney River, and Cillian Murphy in Rodrigo Cortes’ thriller Red Lights.  Sounds like the younger Olsen prefers the darker roles over her sisters’ cuter roles.
Another Earth: The film won the 2011 Alfred P. Sloan Feature Film Prize, which includes receiving $20,000 in cash. Directed by Mike Cahill, the drama stars another break out star Brit Marling, who also co-wrote and produced the film.  The science fiction romance revolves around the discovery of a duplicate earth and the intertwining lives of two strangers.
The Son of No One, the film no one liked:  Although featuring an all-star cast including Al Pacino, Channing Tatum, and Katie Holmes, according to The Hollywood Reporter, the film couldn’t even fill a theater.  The response was so negative that not only did people start leaving early but they also barely deemed it worthy of an applause.  Hopefully the film won’t be left as an orphan and will find a buyer.
Like Crazy won the grand jury dramatic prize:  Directed by Drake Doremus, the drama features a bittersweet love story between Jacob (Anton Yelchin), an American college student and Anna (Felicity Jones), a British student. Jennifer Lawrence, last year’s “it” girl at the Festival, and winner of the grand jury prize, co-stars.  Jones was also presented with a special jury award for her gritty and emotional performance.   The film will be released nationally later this year by Paramount and Indian Paintbrush.
How to Die in Oregon won the grand jury prize for U.S. documentary film:  Peter Richardson directs this rather depressing and shocking documentary that tells the story of Oregon and its decision to be the first state to legalize physician-assisted suicide.

Junior forward Nikola Vucevic was USC’s leading scorer Saturday against Arizona with 18 points, but that’s not the only reason he made the news.
The 6-foot-10 junior told reporters after the game that he was disappointed in USC’s 82-73 loss in Tucson, saying he thought the team “played like women.”
“We didn’t play hard at all. Every single one of us just played like women,” Vucevic said.
On Sunday, Vucevic apologized for his comments, according to the Orange County Register, saying he had the “utmost response” for female athletes.
“I didn’t mean to offend anybody,” he said in a phone interview. “It sounds bad. If somebody got offended, I apologize.”
He explained that he meant to say USC “played soft,” a phrase that didn’t translate from Serbian — the Montenegro native’s first language — to English.
“I respect women’s sports as much as men’s sports. Our women’s team is doing a great job. I respect them, I watch them and I’m good friends with them,” Vucevic said in the same story. “That [disrespecting women] is the last thing I would do.”
Vucevic’s mother was a star on the Sarajevo club basketball team Zeljeznicar in the 1970s, and also was a standout on the Yugoslavian national team. His girlfriend also plays volleyball in Montenegro, the Register said.
USC coach Kevin O’Neill said Vucevic’s comments were not representative of his character.
“He’s one of the most sensitive, good guys there is. I think he said it without thinking, and I know for a fact he regrets it very much,” O’Neill said. “What he said wasn’t what he intended, but obviously it wasn’t the right thing to say.”
“He’d be the last guy who’d be disrespectful to women, or anybody for that matter.”
