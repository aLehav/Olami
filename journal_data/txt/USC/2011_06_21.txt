With the summer releases of Thor and X-Men: First Class behind us and Captain America, Transformers: Dark of the Moon and Cowboys & Aliens on the way, 2011 looks to offer the perfect summer for comic book movies. Green Lantern should fit right in, but instead it fails miserably both on its own merits and when compared to the previous successes of Thor and X-Men.
Green Lantern is based on the 1940s DC Comics series and is set in an alternative universe where Green Lanterns, human and alien alike, each possess a magical power ring that is fueled only by the wearer’s strength of will and can generate anything he or she can imagine. They are members of the Green Lantern Corps, an intergalactic band of peacekeepers led by Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) charged with protecting the universe.

There are aliens, extraterrestrial worlds and battles of good vs. evil, yet bafflingly, there is nothing interesting about the film. The plot is lethargic, the casting is terrible, the special effects add no life and the dialogue is dry and stilted.
Even the couple of half-interesting fight scenes could barely rouse viewers from their popcorn comas. A single component, however, cannot be pinpointed for the film’s lack of quality, rather all the thematic and technical components combine to explain the film’s failure.
Ryan Reynolds plays protagonist Hal Jordan, a self-assured test pilot who starts off as little more than a smug man-child. Hal is certainly not a bad person, but his flippant irresponsibility and arrogance cause him to clash with many of the adults around him, including Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), a fellow test pilot and the object of his affections.
Hal must rise to the challenge of becoming a hero when he is “chosen” by the power ring of dying Abin Sur to replace the alien as a Green Lantern.
Though it’s fair practice to ask audiences to suspend their disbelief to facilitate the enjoyment of a superhero flick, there are limits to our compliance. Any audience member who doesn’t happen to personally belong to the Green Lantern Corps almost certainly lacks the willpower to believe that out of all the possible people on Earth, the ring would choose him.
Reynolds plays Jordan as if he’d rather be somewhere else. The character’s emotional range and likeability are definitely lacking and he seems incredibly tired throughout the film.
Green Lantern has a wide array of compelling and sometimes odd source material to be developed from, and yet it’s surprisingly generic — the artificial sweetener of superhero movies: It looks, smells and tastes like a superhero movie, but turns out to be a fake and leaves a bad aftertaste.

The tired, rehashed dialogue doesn’t yield a single memorable line, while begrudgingly pushing along the even more tired plot. The handful of small, comedic moments that should brighten up the dialogue are nothing more than cheap, calculated winks at the audience. Only one short bit of humor is endearing, lampshading the ridiculousness of an eye-mask being able to conceal a superhero’s identity.
In keeping with the trend, the villain is generic and one-dimensional as well. Parallax, which sounds like an over-the-counter drug administered to hyperactive children, was once a Guardian of the Universe until he was exposed to the yellow energy of fear, turned evil and consequently imprisoned by Abin Sur. Now, he has broken free and has a thirst for revenge. His presence is limited, however, and when he does appear, he looks like a big mass of black and yellow energy with a face: evil for the sake of being evil.
It’s odd that, with all the money poured into the film, it could turn out to be such as mess. The CGI work is mostly standard, except for the emerald suits that look like cartoons. Also, releasing a film based on the Green Lantern was a gamble in the first place, as while the hero does have a solid fan-base, mainstream moviegoers aren’t as familiar with the franchise as they are with figures like Batman or Superman. Warner Bros. would have been better off choosing John Stewart as the protagonist, who played the Green Lantern in Cartoon Network’s recent Justice League series. Better yet, Warner Bros. should have simply put some effort and enthusiasm into its expensive endeavor.
In the end, the film is such a nonentity that it’s not even a disappointment, except perhaps to diehard fans. Green Lantern is nothing more than a copy-and-paste superhero film, and whether it’s brightest day or blackest night, there are an infinite number of things to do instead of see this film.

With the June 20 premiere of RuPaul’s Drag U’s second season, school is already back in session for the eager pupils of the popular Logo network show. Despite the comparatively early start date for the new semester, the recent ‘draguates’ don’t seem to mind getting a head start on their new lives.
You better work · Drag Race season three runner-up Manila Luzon (right) instructs her protége Rhonda in the art of glamour and excess. - Photo courtesy of Aaron Young for Logo 
The unconventional makeover show is a spinoff of RuPaul’s Drag Race, a season-long competition pitting female illusionists from all over the world against one another as they vie for the title of America’s next drag superstar, with winners and runners-up from that show helping (anatomical) women, all dullness and frump, unleash their inner diva — something the drag queens from Drag Race have more than ample qualifications to teach.
Expectedly, the same academic conceit from the show’s debut season is trotted out for this one as well. Viewers are reminded even before the opening credits roll that “Deep in the Lake Titicaca Valley, a school was formed by drag queens to help biological women … change their lives through the miracle of drag.” The familiar (if heavily made-up) faces from Drag Race return in the capacity of professors, complete with every arbitrarily appended academic-sounding prefix and suffix imaginable — professor, Dr. and Ph.D., just to name a few. The school even has a dean of drag, female illusionist icon Lady Bunny.
Notebook paper motifs crop up with sufficient frequency and there’s more than enough fake cherry wood paneling on the set to evoke a collegiate feel, but as with anything in the drag world, it’s all camp from beginning to end. The barrage of academic puns featured in the show’s promotion campaign (yes, spring break is over; we get it, class is back in session) is executed with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek self-mockery that there’s no doubt as to whether RuPaul’s Drag U takes itself too seriously in any way, shape or fashion: It does not.
In each episode, three drag professors coach three ordinary women through the entire process, from the moment the woman first sees an age progression-like projection of what she could look like as a full-fledged glamazon (through the miracle of RuPaul’s patented Dragulator 2.0  technology) to the eventual ‘draguation’ ceremony at the end of each episode. In Monday’s season premiere, generically titled “Bringing Sexy Back,” the three professors were Manila Luzon, Shannel and Raven. Only one-third of this week’s faculty was drawn from the recently wrapped third season of Drag Race — offering a some solace for Drag Race fans who were left jonesing for their Manila fix in the aftermath of the May 2 season three reunion special. Fan favorite Manila Luzon was the runner-up in season one — and many thought a shoo-in to win — while Shannel is a season one alumna and Raven appeared in season two.

For all its campy bells and whistles, the program’s guiding message of promoting confidence and self-worth is undeniably positive. Beyond the dispensation of such sagacious proverbs as “You pluck a chicken — you tweeze your eyebrows” (wisdom courtesy of Raven, Ph.D.), the professors are also charged with bolstering their students’ self-image. In her entrance exam, one of the housewife contestants selected “short, fat and ugly” as the three words that best described her. In that sense, Drag U is offering a valuable service in the rich tradition of the PSAs of yesteryear (kind of).
By the time the frumpy ex-military homemaker Lisa was transformed into “Rai’zon de Rossi,” Rhonda became “Summer Night” and Denise’s dragulation into “Cha Cha Mizrahi” was complete, all three women showed substantial improvements in the way of attitude adjustment, the final component of the D.P.A. scale (Drag transformation, Performance and Attitude adjustment) on which their transformations are assessed.
If the remainder of Drag U’s sophomore season follows through on the implicit promises made by Manila’s Cookie Monster-inspired outfit and the delightfully awkward phone sex competitions to which the contestants were subjected, viewers are in for some uncharacteristically empowering and entertaining reality television.

It’s hard not to fall into the trap of playing the numbers game when discussing Les Misérables.
Seeds of change · Led by the charismatic intellectual Enjolras (Jeremy Hays), a band of students bent on revolution attempt to rally support for an insurrection using the death of a sympathetic government official. - Photo courtesy of Deen van Meer 
The pride and joy of London’s West End has been translated into 21 different languages, has spawned 33 cast recordings and has seen productions staged in 291 cities in 42 countries. The show has played to more than 10,000 audiences in London alone since its 1985 opening, and with most performances weighing in at approximately three hours, the world’s longest running musical just so happens to also run pretty long. Most incredibly, it’s estimated some 55 million people globally have seen Les Mis in one incarnation or another.
But attempting to quantify this show’s greatness is a fool’s errand. You wouldn’t try to explain the appeal of a painting to someone who hadn’t seen it by giving the dimensions of the canvas; in much the same way, the power of the magnificent 25th anniversary production now playing at Downtown’s Ahmanson Theatre has to be seen — or felt, rather — first-hand.
Cameron Mackintosh — legendary producer of the original London version of Les Misérables as well as the only two other longer running Broadway musicals, Cats and The Phantom of the Opera — is again producing the show, the touring version of which is being hailed as a “spectacular new production.”
“Spectacular,” certainly: Matt Kinley’s elaborate sets make for an utterly immersive experience for theatergoers; co-directors Laurence Connor and James Powell’s inspired blocking and staging transported audiences from one unforgettable tableau to the next; as always, Claude-Michel Schönberg’s timeless music somehow manages to carry an emotional weight commensurate with the grand melodramas unfolding onstage.
“New,” however, is another matter. The cast certainly isn’t suffering from any shortage of Les Mis veterans — Justin Scott Brown (Marius), Michael Kostroff (Thénardier), Shawna M. Hamic (Madame Thénardier) and Jeremy Hays (Enjolras) all have prior experience with the show, and with this current production, J. Mark McVey is returning to the lead role of Jean Valjean for just about the 3,000th time (literally). None of the actors gave performances that felt stale in any way, only studied and familiar.
Vocally, the cast in residence at the Ahmanson holds its own against any of the great ensembles featured on the numerous cast recordings in circulation. As devoted distance-mother Fantine, Betsy Morgan delivers the show’s most famous number “I Dreamed A Dream” with all the vocal power and heartbreaking disappointment that audiences have come to expect from the song. Chasten Harmon as Éponine offers a subdued take on “On My Own” to great effect; even Hamic as the sleazy wife of a sleazier still drinking man backs up a consummate comedic performance with a strong vocal showing. And though it probably doesn’t bear saying at all, McVey as Valjean is unimpeachable.

Perhaps the most remarkable innovation in this quarter-centennial anniversary tour was, in fact, Kinley’s set design. Citing inspiration from the paintings of Victor Hugo, the 19th-century French author whose novel was the basis for the 123-years-subsequent musical, Kinley’s stylized background projections afforded the entire production a lush sensuality. The hazy delineations and watercolor effects were infinitely better suited to the show than any crisp Parisian scenic imagery would have been, but in any case, the rear wall projections enabled certain theatrical effects that wouldn’t be possible otherwise. Specifically, the technology allowed for more fully realized representations of motion when it was most needed. Instead of staring at a bloc of actors marching in place and having to will yourself to see a mob of Parisians who have taken to the streets, the receding cityscapes create an astonishingly effective illusion of just that.
In adapting the source material for the stage, librettist Alain Boublil committed some of the most egregious violations of Aristotle’s ‘classical unities’ — those being the unity of action, place and time — ever perpetrated against the ancient philosopher’s vision of what drama should be. The show’s epic scope completely obliterates the idea that the span of time covered in a play’s action should nearly approximate the play’s actual runtime, as well as the suggestion that one set representing one location is all that any audience should be asked to accommodate.
Of course, no fines are incurred from the dramatists’ guild for violations of Aristotle’s classical unities, but it’s worth pointing out — especially to those unfamiliar with the show — how thoroughly Les Mis breaks from those standards is one of its greatest delights. The sweeping tale spans nearly two decades and hops from one French location to the other in the course of telling Valjean’s lengthy game of cat-and-mouse with his single-minded pursuer, Inspector Javert (Andrew Varela), and the development of revolutionary sentiments in poverty-stricken France. Newcomers might be intimidated by the grand scale of the musical, but those who invest the necessary time and attention in this epic production of Les Misérables will almost certainly leave the theater as the joyful ones.
I am going next month – thank you for the great review. I was curious if this new version would hold up the great tradition.

Confidence is often considered key to the success of ambitious students and professionals alike.
Now, a study reveals that not only has the message hit home for the newest college students, but also that confidence is at an all-time high among incoming college freshman, a result researchers categorized as an increase in “overconfidence” among students.
The study, released in the British psychology journal Self and Identity, revealed that in 2009, 60 percent of participants believed their intellectual ability was “above-average.”
Driven · Students have shown greater self-confidence in their ability to achieve academically in comparison to students in prior generations. - Summer Trojan file photo
Data has been collected on intellectual and social self-confidence, among other traits, by the UCLA’s Cooperative Institutional Research program since 1966, and the data collected in 2009 represented the highest percentage of students who described themselves as having high intellectual confidence in the study’s history.
Darnell Cole, associate professor of education, noted the trend of self-confidence among the newest college students stretched beyond academia.
“College students particularly have high levels of self-confidence across the board,” Cole said.
Jean Twenge, psychology professor at San Diego State, described the increase as more than an increase in student’s abilities.
“It’s not just confidence. It’s overconfidence,” Twenge, who led the study, told the Associated Press.
Cole also noted that intellectual self-confidence has been connected with gender and academic major.
“Women typically come into college with slightly less self-confidence when compared to men,” Cole said.
The authors of the study argued the increased confidence might be a result of grade inflation, or assigning higher grades to work that would have received a lower mark in the past to bolster academic achievement. The study noted that in 1966 only 19 percent of students surveyed earned either an “A” or “A-minus” grade average in high school, in comparison to 48 percent in 2009.
In 1966, only 39 percent of students surveyed said their intellectual self-confidence was above average.
“Often, if you’re getting good grades all the time, then you tend to think you’re doing well,” Cole said. “If there is, indeed, grade inflation, then there is a higher sense of intellectual ability than is warranted.”
Once students get to college, self-confidence built by performance in high school can play a major role in their experiences.
“A correcting factor comes into play, there’s an adjustment,” Cole said. “For many [college students], college isn’t as easy as high school, so we do see adjustments to their intellectual sense of self.”
I loved getting hammered down at USC in my Science and Anthropology Classes. Casual interests can remain just that and confidence in a career direction expounds. If everyone believes they’re great in everything, only flounders will be created and degrees really are just pieces of paper. ‘SC doesn’t let this happen.  FIGHT ON!
I read somewhere that the Ivies implemented GPA deflation sometime during the 1960s, and many other respected universities did likewise. It’s ridiculous to think that everyone could earn a 4.0 GPA.

The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission would be unable to gather the $60 million required to make the promised renovations to the Coliseum, leaving USC and university officials to ponder the school’s future in the 88-year-old stadium.
Tradition · USC has played its home football games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum since the venue opened in Exposition Park in 1923. - Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Trojan 
In the days since the report, officials from both the commission and the university have remained confident their working relationship can continue without issue.
Kristina Raspe, associate senior vice president for real estate and asset management said the university intends to work with the commission to make the renovations and keep USC at the Coliseum.
“USC remains committed to working with the Coliseum Commission to find a way to achieve the improvements needed for the Coliseum to become a first-class stadium once again,” Raspe said in a
statement.
The Coliseum, which hosts all USC home football games, is under the authority of the commission, a nine-member committee comprised of city, county and state officials that oversee the sports complex and is funded solely by the revenue from its facilities.
The commission and USC agreed to an extendable 25-year lease in 2008, which allowed for USC to continue playing in the stadium while portioning 8 percent of ticket sales and $1.8 million to the commission annually as well as giving USC the right of first refusal if an NFL team were to propose relocation to the grounds.
The 2008 agreement also provided a list of renovations the commission committed to achieve.
Los Angeles City Councilman Bernard Parks, a member of the Coliseum Commission and councilman for the USC area, also stressed the continued strong relationship between the university and the commission.
“Once the [2008] lease was signed, we’ve had a very smooth relationship with the university and created a better environment,” Parks said.
Parks also noted the commission’s efforts to continue to keep the interests of all parties involved in the Coliseum ­— the university as well as the city, county and state — in mind and at the forefront of the commission’s decisions moving forward.
If the commission is indeed unable to meet the expectations of the renovations, under the terms of the current contract between the parties, the university could pay for and implement the renovations to the noticeably aging Coliseum on its own terms. If USC were to take over the renovation work, the contract would relieve the university from paying rent to the commission, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The university could also ask for a master lease on the Coliseum, which would transfer the responsibility for repairs and maintenance to USC while requiring the university to pay rent to either the commission or the state. Both options would allow USC to continue to play at the stadium.
Conversely, USC could elect to end its long-term residency at the Exposition Park facility and move to another location, as it threatened to do during tenuous negotiations with the commission in 2007.
The commission is expected to have a $302,000 operating loss for the fiscal year ending June 30, but the commission’s books would be stable for at least the next 12 months, according to the Los Angeles Times.
A new $6-million electronic scoreboard to be unveiled during the 2011 season was recently announced as part of the planned renovations.
Parks said the improvement to the scoreboard was chosen by the commission to help modernize the Coliseum’s fan experience.
Maybe if they allowed EDC to be there this year, the Coliseum wouldn’t be in as big of a financial pickle…
We could threaten to leave the Coliseum, but what alternative do we have?  The Rose Bowl?  Build a new stadium in Irwindale?  Please.
Maybe that new field that’s going to be built by AEG next to the staples center?

College is a time to be ambitious, discover passions and take adventures. Beyond classes, it allows us to find out what matters to us, and pursue it. Maybe it’s defending a cause, or working for an idea. Unfortunately, when it comes to that kind of activism, students are sometimes at a loss.
Jovanna Tosello | Summer Trojan
In Cairo, Egypt, youth were a major part of the revolution at the end of January that resulted in then-President Hosni Mubarak stepping down.
“College students are at the center of the uprising,” said Mohamad Elmasry, assistant professor of mass communication at Qatar University, to The Houstonian at the time of the revolution. “This has been termed the ‘Youth’s Revolt’ because the overwhelming majority of protesters and organizers are young people.”
The revolution followed a similar one in Tunisia and sparked protests all across the Middle East and North Africa. The so-called Arab Spring has been a political and social tsunami, and a shining example of what college students can do when they commit to a cause.
In Egypt now, more than four months since Mubarak stepped down, students are still taking action. While I study abroad at the American University in Cairo, I see students — many of whom participated in the revolution — discussing the next steps for Egypt.
These discussions include organizing political parties, protesting the interim rule of the military and even searching for solutions to seemingly acute causes such as environmental policy and social programs for the poor. The Egyptian youth are civically engaged, socially aware and possess the will to change the status quo.
Why aren’t we more visibly concerned with and vocally supportive of the causes we believe in.
We don’t have a dictator to overthrow, but in the United States, and Los Angeles specifically, there is a large wealth gap, with many people living on the streets. There’s pollution, people going hungry, a struggling education system and, as we saw in Bell, political corruption.
Los Angeles also possesses countless ways to get involved and work to solve these problems. On campus alone, there are opportunities available for every student to accommodate wide-ranging interests.
So here’s an idea: Let’s get active this year. That doesn’t mean everyone has to paint their faces Braveheart-style and loudly shout slogans against the system, but why not support a cause?
That does not necessarily mean joining one of the college’s political clubs, though USC College Republicans and USC College Democrats both offer ways to get involved. If politics and local elections are your interest, dive right in and go to work. These groups can find you campaigns to volunteer for or internships with politicians.
Activism shouldn’t be limited to just party platforms. Talk to those clipboard-carrying people wandering campus during the day. They might have an organization that appeals to you. You could find a way to benefit the group with your talents while participating in something that interests you.
At any given day, there can be representatives for environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace, or food drives trying to find new avenues of support to help feed the poor. The representatives want to talk and are typically more than happy to field any questions.
A visit to the USC Volunteer Center will give you varying dozens of options. These opportunities range from simple activity days of feeding the poor to helping plant a neighborhood garden to the Jumpstart Corps tutoring service designed to help ensure children enter school prepared for learning the course material. It’s a great way to find out what is available around campus and how to join in.
Maybe you’re studying overseas and witnessing community activism. Or maybe you’re on campus at USC and wondering what to do. Well, now is the time to take action. The revolutions of the Arab Spring show that students can make a difference. Activism doesn’t have to be limited to political radicals or that one-week overseas alternative break. Students can work to help others any time of the year.
It doesn’t matter if you’re one person volunteering your time at a local school or you are one of dozens of students working to clean up the streets of trash (although the more the merrier, and more effective you can be). Our opportunities are endless, and our ability to change the world is limitless.
Students are more powerful than we like to think. Our peers overseas are risking it all for what they believe in. Let’s use that as inspiration to make impactful changes to matters that concern us.

The USC women’s golf team was ranked No. 1 throughout its 2010-11 season, and part of the reason for its success was the play of two golfers.
Greatness · Lizette Salas earned Pac-10 Player of the Year for the second time in her career and is USC’s first-ever four-time All-American. - Photo courtesy of Sports Information 
Senior Lizette Salas was awarded the Pac-10 Player of the Year award, and freshman Sophia Popov was named the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year. Salas’ award marks the third year in a row a Woman of Troy has been named player of the year and the second time Salas has won the title. Jennifer Song won it in 2010.
“It was a complete shock,” Salas said. “I had no idea I was considered, especially since I didn’t win a tournament this year. I played pretty decent all season and I had great teammates and they brought out the best in me.”
Salas and Popov were named 2011 National Golf Coaches Association first team All-Americans in May, thanks to their performances at the NCAA competition, and were also named members of the All-Pac-10 First Team.
Salas had been ranked as high as No. 2 during the regular season and is USC’s only four-time All-American. She holds the fourth-best season average in school history, and her 14 career rounds in the 60s is second-most ever at USC.
While Salas’ impressive career at USC is ending, Popov’s is just beginning. She was also named the NCGA Freshman of the Year last month and won three titles this year, including the Pac-10 title.
“I knew she was going to get freshman of the year, just because she won three times and she is a great player and very intense on the golf course,” Salas said.
In addition to these two golfers, USC coach Andrea Gaston was named 2011 NGCA Coach of the Year.

The “one more year” chants echoing throughout the Galen Center on Senior Night and the smile breaking across Nikola Vucevic’s face as he prepared himself at the foul line told me everything I needed to know.
Vucevic leading the Trojans as a junior was merely a pleasant wish; his final home victory was the perfect send-off in accomplishing what he hoped for in coming to USC.
Nothing could hold him back.
Not the hope of an NCAA tournament run, not a bunch of gold-clad students pleading for him to stay, not even negative evaluations from NBA scouts. He was leaving school a year early and entering the NBA draft.
Summer Trojan file photo
And it just didn’t feel right.
Vucevic and the 2010-11 USC men’s basketball team were a group of players you could endear yourself to because they were like the average college kid: talented and full of promise, but still vulnerable to the trials of growing up.
They fought each and every game to find a groove, only to have to start all over again after their path was derailed by adding new players to the mix or general lapses in play.
Vucevic was the leading scorer (17.1) and rebounder (10.3), and the Trojans’ most dependable and effective weapon.
And he led a rather young team.
Rather than dazzle or dominate, Vucevic was a quiet force that could only have been made louder with another 365 days of nurturing in the Galen Center’s womb.
He was a clash of worlds — part finesse, part power, but neither side breaking out into the extraordinary. Instead of wowing with dunks, 3-pointers that barely touched the net and screams that rang into the upper deck, he used a variety of solid, tough post moves and hustle plays to go along with a refined perimeter game.
He wasn’t rangy and athletic like the projectable American big men that scouts drool about, nor did he show a nasty streak by swinging elbows under the basket.
He also lacked the mystique —  and subsequently inflated draft stock — typically attributed to the players cut from his mold. Skilled and savvy big men from overseas are lauded by scouts for their potential as matchup nightmares.
Contrarily, the state of the school’s basketball program helped prop the exit door wide open for the Montenegro native.
Three of Vucevic’s fellow starters would be graduating, a group of integral counterparts to his fundamentally sound game.
Donte Smith’s dangerous outside shooting was gone.
Forward Marcus Simmons’ departure took the team’s best perimeter defender away.
Alex Stepheson’s departure took away the frontcourt-mate and muscle that allowed him to roam a little bit more, have a little more space to operate on offense and an anchor with him on defense.
With three of his longest-tenured and most talented teammates leaving school, it seemed as if Vucevic’s decision to enter the NBA draft was coaxed out of him by the task of rebuilding instead of deciding to leave on his own terms.
Upon his declaration, he was projected as a second-round pick — those drafted in the second round are not guaranteed rookie contracts. With a labor dispute in the making, Vucevic could have been left jobless, hoping for negotiations to finish as soon as possible.
But thus far, he has proven me wrong.
In the last few months, Vucevic’s stock has skyrocketed. He was the tallest and heaviest player to enter the draft, measuring at just under 7 feet and 260 pounds and now projects as a legitimate NBA center, a scarce resource in today’s game.
He has also shown improved quickness, shooting ability and offensive moves.
With the draft coming up tomorrow, Vucevic has been projected to be picked as high as seventh to the Sacramento Kings and figures to be drafted 27th by the Spurs at the lowest.
He has also worked out for seven teams like the Charlotte Bobcats, Houston Rockets, Philadelphia 76ers, New York Knicks, Denver Nuggets and Boston Celtics.
The Trojans’ most valuable player’s name will be called early Thursday evening, and he should have the whole student section cheering for him again.

With the Staples Center just down Figueroa Street from the Galen Center, playing in the NBA does not seem out of reach for most USC basketball players.
Talented · Forward Nikola Vucevic has impressed scouts at pre-draft workouts and could be taken in the NBA draft lottery on Thursday. - Summer Trojan file photo 
The dream will be even closer Thursday for several former Trojans who hope to hear their name called during the NBA draft at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J.
Nikola Vucevic is expected to be the first Trojan to go in this year’s draft.
After averaging a team-high 17.1 points and 10.3 rebounds per game last season and being named First-Team All-Pac-10, Vucevic decided to forgo his senior season to enter the draft.
And his stock has been rising in recent mock drafts.
Although most universities exaggerate the size of their student-athletes, USC modestly listed Vucevic at 6-foot-10, 240 pounds. At the annual NBA draft combine in Chicago, Vucevic surprised scouts by measuring just under 7 feet when wearing shoes, making him the tallest player at the combine. Vucevic also weighed in at a muscular 260 pounds and recorded the highest standing reach and the second-longest wingspan.
Vucevic also impressed the scouts with how much his offensive game improved from when he averaged 2.6 points and 2.7 rebounds per game as a freshman.
“Nikola’s great advantage is that he is going to be able to guard [NBA power forwards and centers], which very few people can do,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said during Vucevic’s press conference in April, where he declared his eligibility for the draft. “He is going to have to become an NBA 3-point shooter. The lines on an NBA court are considerably longer, and it is a huge adjustment.”
Sports Illustrated’s Sam Amick and DraftExpress.com predict Vucevic will be picked 16th overall by the Philadelphia 76ers.
Alex Stepheson transfered from North Carolina to USC for the 2008-2009 season. - Summer Trojan file photo
Playing alongside Vucevic in the frontcourt for two seasons, Alex Stepheson, a 6-foot-10, 250-pound forward who transferred to USC from North Carolina, worked out with the Charlotte Bobcats.
As a junior, Stepheson led the Pac-10 with an average of 3.4 offensive rebounds per game. As a senior, he averaged 9.8 points and 9.2 rebounds per game.
Senior Marcus Simmons also has professional aspirations. The 6-foot-6, 220-pound guard developed a reputation as a lock-down defender, often guarding the opposing team’s best player. As a senior, he was named the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year, averaging 5.1 points and 2.8 rebounds per game.
Simmons had workouts with the Los Angeles Lakers, Milwaukee Bucks, New Jersey Nets and Toronto Raptors.
No Trojans were selected in the 2010 NBA draft. DeMar DeRozan and Taj Gibson were first round picks in the 2009 NBA draft.
I just wanted to add that Alex Stepheson has had more than one workout.  He has worked out with the Charlotte Bobcats, Toronoto Raptors, Sacramento Kings, and Minnesota Timberwolves and has an upcoming workout with the Los Angeles Clippers.

For college athletes, conventional wisdom says when it comes to deciding whether to head to the professional ranks or stay in school, injured players should choose the latter. There’s too much at risk and too much to lose by turning pro. Or so the thinking goes.
Perseverance · Pitcher Chad Smith struggled as a sophomore but turned his play around while pitching in the Alaska Summer League and as a reliever for USC last season. After undergoing Tommy John surgery, Smith was drafted by the MLB’s Detroit Tigers. - Summer Trojan file photo 
USC junior closer Chad Smith is facing that dilemma.
The 6-foot-3 Los Angeles native, who injured his right elbow during a mid-April home series against Oregon, underwent Tommy John surgery May 20 at the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Clinic in Anaheim, Calif.
Because of the serious nature of the procedure, in which a ligament in the elbow is typically replaced with a tendon from the knee, and the lengthy rehab process, Smith would be sidelined for the entire 2011 college season, provided he returns to USC.
“It would be a great honor, just to be a captain my senior year and really finish what I started,” Smith said. “But with me being out all of next season, it’s now a different situation.”
In a surprising turn of events, the hard-throwing right-hander was recently selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 17th round of this month’s MLB draft — 527th overall.
Smith had anticipated his draft stock to plummet in the aftermath of the injury, considering the extent of the rehab process.
“I talked to a lot of teams and knew I would get drafted,” Smith said. “But for them to pick me up in the 17th round was really a lot higher than I expected.”
If Smith chooses to remain at USC, he will be on track to graduate in spring 2012, fulfilling a promise he made to his parents in high school, but he would be forced to watch every game from the dugout.
Signing, as a result, which must be done before the MLB Aug. 15 deadline, remains a particularly intriguing option. Smith could finish summer school before leaving for the Tigers’ spring training facility in Lakewood, Fla., for a rehab session until fall classes begin. This would leave him just a couple courses shy of graduation.
After the semester, Smith would be able to continue recuperating in Lakewood before playing Class-A short season in Connecticut, which begins in June.
Despite some of the advantages of going pro, Smith remains mum on his future.
“I’m really just going to wait and see how it goes and see what they want to offer,” Smith said. “I’ve still got some good options.”
Before the injury, Smith’s future looked like it was falling into place.
Smith, who throws a fastball and a hard slider as his out pitch, finally found a role he was comfortable in this season, thriving in the closer role after originally coming to USC as a starting pitcher under then-coach Chad Kreuter.
In 2009, Smith posted a pedestrian 3.40 ERA in four starts, before regressing as a sophomore in 2010, finishing with a 4.47 ERA through six starts.
“I would throw a great four innings, and then I couldn’t get out of the fifth inning,” he said, recalling some of his past struggles. “And that happened to me quite a few times. I couldn’t keep that focus.”
Playing for the Peninsula Oilers of the Alaska Summer League in summer 2010, Smith came out of the bullpen for the first time and watched things turn around, finishing with a 0.46 ERA and three saves in 14 appearances.
“I really liked coming into a game, throwing strikes and just getting outs,” said Smith, who expects to be a reliever in the Tigers’ system should he sign. “There’s nothing better than closing a game out.”
His performance last season indicated as much for the junior, when he held opposing batters to a .216 average while sporting a 2.66 ERA and four saves — until the injury.
“From a selfish perspective, we knew it’d be tough to move on considering we were losing one of our better arms,” said senior starter Andrew Triggs. “But also as a friend, it was real tough to see him go down like that.”
Smith, who still hopes to play professionally at some point, admits the injury has changed his outlook moving forward.
“I had never been hurt before,” Smith said. “I was always thinking baseball would be there, baseball would be there, but once it’s taken away, you have surgery, you undergo rehab, you realize how great you really had it.”
