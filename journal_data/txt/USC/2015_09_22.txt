The Sol Price School of Public Policy is offering a new bachelor of science degree in real estate development this semester. Price is offering the new undergraduate degree almost 30 years after it became an industry leader by founding one of the first graduate real estate development programs in the country in 1986.
Director Christian Redfearn emphasized the importance of wanting to “change the culture of real estate.” Redfearn expressed his interest in opening up 21st century educational opportunities to undergraduates.
“We wanted a larger real estate community. The world has changed and [the real estate] industry has changed so much,” he said. “We sat down and talked to potential employers in the field and created an academic plan to submit to the dean which was approved. We are [still] tweaking — we took the building blocks from the graduate program and asked, ‘How do we build around them?’”
Associate Director Sonia Savoulian said the bachelor of science degree intends to introduce students to the world of real estate development.
“[The undergraduate program is] much more about laying a foundation, while the master’s in real estate development is really more about adding advanced training intended to be for people who have already been working in the [real estate development] field,” she said.
Specifically the undergraduate program starts with a broader prerequisite track than the more advanced and specified master’s program. The undergraduate real estate development program also relies heavily on finance and accounting training, while the undergraduate policy, planning and development relies heavily on courses related to policy and governance issues.
Redfearn believes that the undergraduate program provides a well-rounded approach in preparing not only graduate students but also undergraduates for the rigors of the real estate profession. Redfearn stressed the fact that the undergraduate real estate development program should rely heavily on an interdisciplinary tradition.
“We want to produce really good thinkers. [Our program] is not finance and it’s not architecture — it’s a very interdisciplinary degree,” he said. “Many students don’t realize the large range of subjects and issues that are covered by real estate development.”
Redfaern said it is crucial for students to be able to synthesize large amounts of information.
“There are all of these trends — you are essentially making a bet on the area and the city [at large],” he said. “I want our students to consider the bigger picture.”
Savoulian reinforced the importance of the bigger picture the real estate development major takes into account.
“Our students are curious about the nature of cities,” Savoulian said. “While financial knowledge is important, in the big picture, they want to play a role in creating places in cities, they want to understand the urban context.”
Samantha Schroff, a freshman majoring in real estate development, said she was drawn to the new program because of her diverse interests.
“I had so many varied interests in real estate, business, finance, community service and philanthropy, and I really had no clue how I was going to be able to bring them all together,” she said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “And then I attended the Price reception on Admitted Student Day, and Professor Redfearn and Managing Director Sonia Savoulian, announced the real estate development bachelor of science [degree]. I felt a huge sense of relief and excitement because the [program] just really seemed to fit all of my criteria and was going to be able to join all of my diverse interests into one cohesive program of study.”
At the beginning of the semester, Redfearn took the new students in the program to explore downtown Los Angeles.
“We took 25 incoming undergrads on a tour,” Redfearn said. “We started at Grand Park, [and] we talked about the role of public transit in cities. We visited the real estate property manager for the L.A. Times, [and] we thought about why Whole Foods is coming downtown and the demographics of cities. By the end of the day, 25 students who thought they knew what real estate was were blown away. We raised their awareness.”
Schroff said the tour reinforced her decision to pursue the new degree.
“It was awesome to see how planning, finance, city leaders and real estate professionals all come together to work on a development project, and it is neat to see how DTLA is having a revitalization similar to downtown Santa Ana in Orange County,” she said.

Students gathered in front of Tommy Trojan on Tuesday for National Voter Registration Day, a nationwide event that aims to promote greater participation in elections.
The event featured remarks by Alex Padilla, California Secretary of State, as well as Dan Schnur, director of the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics; Dean Logan, the Los Angeles Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk; Dean Florez, a former California state senator and current legislator-in-residence; and Rini Sampath, Undergraduate Student Government president.
“A lot of students say, ‘Why should I care? Politics, why would I want to involve myself with it? I can’t relate. It doesn’t represent me, reflect me, my values or my issues,’” Padilla said. “I’m here to tell you that’s exactly why you need to register and that’s exactly why you need to vote.”
Speakers stressed the importance of encouraging young, college-aged people to become involved in the political process by registering to vote. Logan said that in Los Angeles alone, there are nearly 1.2 million eligible voters who are not registered to vote.
Padilla noted that of this bloc of eligible voters in Los Angeles, the largest group was young people from 18-24 years old and that the number of those eligible who are unregistered swells to 7 million people when considering the state of California as a whole. In 2012, California’s voter registration rate was ranked No. 41 in the United States.
Turnout was steady throughout the event, which took place from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Students could also receive a free slice of pizza after registering. At the booths set up for registering new voters, students said that they were looking forward to engaging in the political process.
“The reason why I’m registering to vote is because people our age generally don’t try, and they complain about it,” said Reiana Requena, an undeclared sophomore. “So instead of just complaining about it, I want to actually try and change policy.”
Five hundred and forty-nine students registered to vote at the event. According to Schnur, this number is nearly double the amount of students who registered at last year’s National Voter Registration Day event.
Greater student interest has perhaps been sparked by a robust start to the 2016 election cycle with a wide array of candidates running for president.
“It’s clear that some of the candidates for president have attracted an unusual amount of attention,” Schnur said. “But once students have finished paying attention to some of the candidates, they stick around to participate in the broader conversation. Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders and some of the more notable candidates may be attracting student interest, but it’s the conversation about their future that’s keeping USC students involved and engaged in the conversation going forward. They show up to listen to Donald Trump, but they stick around for more substantive conversation after that.”
Sampath, who became an American citizen in 2014, spoke of her personal appreciation for the right to vote but added that there is more work to be done.
“There are still some communities that are disenfranchised by modern barriers to voting,” she said. “So as young people, it’s more important than ever to appreciate the right we have to vote and the power that comes with it.”
The Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk also awarded USC a proclamation recognizing it for its involvement in National Voter Registration Day.
Hosts of the event included the Unruh Institute, the L.A. County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk, USG, the Korean American Coalition, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, Political Student Assembly, USC College Democrats, USC College Republicans, the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, Latino Student Assembly, CALPIRG, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority and Program Board.
Other students who registered said they wanted to exercise their newly realized right.
“I just turned 20, and it’s the first time I can vote, so I’m becoming interested in politics and getting involved in voting,” said Mineh Badalians, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering.

Jenny Di, director of the Political Student Assembly, accepted an award on behalf of USC for the school’s participation in National Voter Registration Day Tuesday morning at the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors meeting.
“The L.A. County Board of Supervisors wanted to recognize USC because it’s an undergraduate university where the young people are a demographic which we target when it comes to elections either on a local or national level,” Di said. “This award will show that we are making great strides to engaging our whole campus in politics.”
The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, along with other student political groups, all contributed to USC receiving the award.
“They were leading the effort in voter registration and PSA along with the Black Student Assembly, the Undergraduate Student Government and a lot of different groups on campus sponsoring and co-hosting the registration event,” Di said.
USC received this award for its continued political involvement, especially in regard to its emphasis on voter registration. Today, an event was held on campus in front of Tommy Trojan.
“We know that there is a level of civic engagement on campus, and we wanted to tie that in to national voter registration and mobilization day,” said Mark Ridley-Thomas, supervisor of the second district in Los Angeles County. “We want to acknowledge those entities that can and should be involved in the life of our communities.”
The presentation of the award took place at 9:30 a.m. as part of the meeting. Dean Logan, the  registrar-recorder and county clerk who organized the event, was responsible for giving the ceremonial scroll to USC through Di.
“In the act of being registered voters, we all have the opportunity to influence and participate in our elections process,” Logan said.
Unruh Institute Director Dan Schnur also presented the award to USG President Rini Sampath at the National Voter Registration Day event at Tommy Trojan several hours later, allowing students to see the prestigious recognition.
Ridley-Thomas, who is also a USC alumnus, hopes that honoring the University will help reverse the trend of decreasing voter turnout.
“[Recognizing USC] essentially puts a fine point on the fact that voter registration and voter turnout is down and acknowledging those entities that can and should be involved in the civic life of our communities,” Ridley-Thomas said. “We put a spotlight on motivated students, faculty, administration who want to say that Los Angeles has the highest concentration of voters in the entire state and can lead the nation. And what better way to do that than to acknowledge one of the premier institutions in our region to accomplish that.”

Shyann Murphy, director of the Women’s Student Assembly, defended the organization’s mission statement to the Undergraduate Student Government Senate at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Tuesday night.
Murphy, a junior, showcased some of their signature events for this year. These include FemFest, which gives space to musicians and artists of marginalized backgrounds; Take Back the Night, which allows sexual assault survivors to speak and heal while advocating for a safer campus; and the upcoming Body Love Week, which encourages “radical self love.”
“The focus of Body Love Week this year is to recognize that body love is an ongoing process, so we’re having a lot of events that focus on healing and learning to love your body and learning to appreciate your body,” Murphy said. “As people, we’re constantly invaded with these messages that we’re not enough if our bodies are not enough.”
Murphy also explained that being a student at USC is a “huge social privilege,” and that the student body should challenge “oppressive structures of power.”
“An oppressive structure of power, in my mind, is anything that discourages and puts a barrier to the success that a group is capable of having,” Murphy said.
Murphy cited sexual assault as an example, arguing that women who fear being assaulted are negatively impacted in academic settings, with many victims dropping out of school.
USG Residential Senator Giuseppe Robalino said that the description of WSA on its online page sounded too forceful.
“I read a description of your group … where you say that you ‘work to dismantle oppressive structures of power,’” Robalino said. “Now my concern … is that considering that all the other programming board assemblies that have been featured on our page, the tone of their mission statement and descriptions are very much about inclusiveness, education, empowerment, but the wording [in the WSA page] could come off as fighting words.”
Murphy responded that the reason certain student sectors need inclusion is because they are being oppressed.
“By shying away from things that are oppressive structures of power, you are ignoring those structures and allowing them to continue,” Murphy said. “When I look at the campus survey and I see that … women who were sexually assaulted didn’t report their sexual assault because of the structures we have at USC, you don’t encourage them to report. Then that’s a structure of power.”
Murphy emphasized that she doesn’t mind the aggressiveness.
“I see my position and my budget as a way to dismantle that structure,” Murphy said. “Those might sound like fighting words, but when there are people who don’t feel comfortable and safe on our campus, then it is appropriate to have that fight.”
Furthermore, she expressed the importance of not caring about the tone of crucial ideas.
“There is this term called ‘tone policing,’” Murphy said. “It’s the idea that when somebody has a certain tone, you’re putting them down or saying my emotions and my tone and the way that I choose to express things doesn’t make my point any less valid or legitimate.”
After the meeting, Lena Melilo, WSA assistant director, said that microaggressions are one of the significant ways oppression manifests itself.
“You might not even notice them, but all these microaggressions add up,” Melilo said. “If you hear rape jokes on campus, and people say, ‘That’s just a joke,’ that makes you feel unsafe on campus. Or if you’re in a class, and the syllabus only has straight, white, upper middle-class men, then you might not feel like your voice is being heard.”
Murphy agreed that sometimes concerns about being too politically correct must be questioned.
“There are a lot of concerns about being ‘PC,’ and I think that sometimes [they] come from a place of not wanting to be challenged on everyday things that we just kind of assume,” Murphy said. “So it’s important, especially if you’re concerned that you’re being silenced, for you to question why it is so necessary for you to say that.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Sen. Giuseppe Robalino said the wording on the WSA page could come off as exciting. Robalino said it could come off as “fighting words.”  The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Blogger Michelle Lee showed her parents around her new home in London (including trips on the Tube) last week. Contributed by Michelle Lee | Daily Trojan
Last weekend, I took my first trip out of London to the lovely city of Amsterdam. I spent the weekend there with my parents before returning to London to show them around my newfound home. Reflecting on this experience, I feel like I learned a lot about the process of not only studying abroad but living abroad. You learn a thing or two when you suddenly become a tour guide of a city you’ve only lived in for a month, and it truly is an enlightening experience.
Amsterdam is a beautiful city, with canals running through the center of the city and many museums and sites to see. We, of course, went to the famous “I am Amsterdam” sign and took a relaxing boat ride through the canals. A tip to future Amsterdam-bound travelers: Watch out, because everything (including signs to buy train/bus tickets) is entirely in Dutch and is super confusing, especially coming from London where you don’t have to deal with a language barrier. It is a lovely city, but a small one — so you can see most of the attractions in one day. It’s hard for me to describe the feeling of returning to London after my first trip outside the city. It was so great to travel and become a tourist once again, but it was also amazing to come back home to London. It’s still a little strange for me to pair “home” and “London” together as I’ve only been here for a month, but it really did feel like returning back to my hometown after being gone — even though I was only away for three days. It was so comforting to return back to my flat, my friends, the familiar places and streets — everything that made it feel like home.
Michelle Lee | Daily Trojan
Another element that contributed to my feeling of being at home in a new city was having my parents come visit me. It was great to see my parents again, but the pressure of showing them around the city I wasn’t entirely sure I knew myself yet was overwhelming. I learned that I can’t make it as a tour guide quite yet, after I got us lost multiple times. However, afterward, it really made me feel like I knew the city, and, as my own tour guide said, I am now a true Londoner.
I took them to all the popular tourist sites, including Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Tower Bridge and many more, and I guess the true test of what makes a place home is when you’re no longer taken aback and in awe by these places. Of course it’s lovely, but it felt very nonchalant to casually drive by Trafalgar Square, a world-famous tourist destination. It was a feeling similar to not being wowed by any of the popular Los Angeles landmarks because I’ve been there for so long.
As I said goodbye to my parents today on their way back home, I truly felt like I was home in London. It reminded me of why I chose London as my study abroad destination, and how we all choose our place for a reason. A large part of my reason to come here was to be able to have a “second home” in London. Today marks a full month in London, and I am so happy to be here, at home, where I’m supposed to be.

USC women’s volleyball kicks off Pac-12 play on Wednesday, as the team travels crosstown to take on rival UCLA. The Women of Troy take a perfect 12-0 record into Pauley Pavilion and have dropped just two of their 38 sets so far this season.
The team is coming off of another impressive tournament showing in Norman, Oklahoma, to cap off its dominant preseason. Wins over Oklahoma and Maryland boosted USC into      No. 3 in the nation, and the Women of Troy have rocketed up the rankings after starting at No. 22 less than a month ago.
Though the squad is undoubtedly talented, not many were expecting USC to be such a force this season. Head coach Mick Haley admitted that he was also a bit surprised — not that he’s complaining.
“We really thought it would take a little bit longer for these young kids to get acclimated,” he said. “But they’re pretty volleyball savvy and they’re competitive.”
Conference play, however, will pose a new kind of challenge to the Women of Troy. The players will be pitted against opponents they face year in and year out and who are more aware of their tendencies on the court as a result.
“They are going to be familiar with you,” Haley said. “They know your coaching styles; [Pac-12 teams] study each other all the time.”
While the Women of Troy have been busy studying the Bruins in preparation for the game, Haley knows the Bruins are aware of his team’s weaknesses as well.
“They’ll attack any weaknesses that we have, and they’ll attack them ferociously. It’ll be interesting to see how our kids hold up,” he said.
The Women of Troy actually find themselves at an advantage in this regard going into their Pac-12 matchups. Since USC overhauled its system after last season, other teams in the conference will have less tape on the squad’s playing style leading up to a match. Coach Haley hoped this would give his team the edge.
“[UCLA] really haven’t played against a USC team that has this kind of speed and this kind of scoring potential,” he said.
UCLA will aim to prove Haley wrong on Wednesday night. The    No. 13 Bruins have also gotten off to a strong start in their 2015 campaign and have not dropped a match since August. Their last loss came when they fell 0-3 to Loyola Marymount. UCLA responded well to the early season loss, winning its next eight games by a combined score of 24-3.
The Bruins will play their first game of the year in the Pauley Pavilion when the Women of Troy visit; they played their first two home games of the season in the John Wooden Center.
USC will have extra motivation for Wednesday’s contest, as the Women of Troy fell to the Bruins in both their meetings last year. The Pac-12 opener at the Galen Center finished 0-3, and the team finished its regular season with a 2-3 loss in Westwood.
Haley said that he “could not fathom” losing two years in a row to UCLA but was confident that this year’s team would snap the skid.
“They have a completely different focus,” he said. “They may be young, but they are certainly hungry.”
This 2015 squad looks different from last year’s. At this point in 2014, the Women of Troy limped into their Pac-12 opener against the Bruins having lost three of their last four, and they would go on to start a three-game skid with a loss to UCLA. Now with a new look and newfound confidence, USC will try to turn the tables this season. The game will begin at 7:30 p.m. with TV coverage on the Pac-12 Network.

Blogger Maya Anderman’s first trip outside of London, even with people she hardly knew, was a success. Maya Anderman | Daily Trojan.
For students who decide to study abroad, part of the appeal of coming to a place like Europe is the opportunity to explore other countries during their free time. A quick train ride to Paris, a short flight to Rome— it all sounds lovely and luxurious. But what people rarely discuss is the fact that you are essentially planning to travel to all these places with complete strangers.
Of course this is not always the case, but at a school the size of USC chances are you are not going to know most of the people in your study abroad program. Besides my roommate, I knew no one coming into this semester. We all arrived here and talked about different places we wanted to go, accepting the fact that we practically knew nothing about each other but were still willing to travel the world together.
This was all put to the test this past weekend, as my suitemates and I made our way to Scotland. I am happy to report that after three days, we all came out alive!
Scotland was a great first place to travel. Only a four-hour train ride from London, the journey proved quite easy for us. This may be in part due to the adorable baby sitting next to us on the train who kept us entertained the entire way there.
Soon after our arrival, my flat mates and I decided to climb Arthur’s Seat in Holyrood Park, perhaps the most touristy thing we did all weekend.
As beautiful as it was, I don’t think any of us knew quite what we were getting ourselves into. We cheerfully moseyed along to the park, none of us in appropriate hiking gear, only to realize after an intense 40 minutes, that we were climbing to literally the highest point in all of Edinburgh. Besides the grueling trek up to the top (I may have complained a bit more than my fellow travel companions), it was completely worth it. It was one of the most beautiful views I had ever seen. The only thing I can think to compare it to is “The Sound of Music” (and yes I did repeatedly and loudly sing “The Hills Are Alive” almost the entire way up).
The rest of the weekend included a visit to Edinburgh Castle, Greyfriars Kirkyard where J.K. Rowling picked up a few inspirations for Harry Potter names, and a walk around the University of Edinburgh (in which we saw dorms that could be mistaken for castles and subsequently all questioned our decision to stay in the U.S. for college).

On our last night, we all partook in a pub-crawl, in which over the course of six hours we visited seven different bars and clubs. All I will say in regard to this is that it was a very fun and memorable evening, but the train ride back to London was much less pleasant than the train ride there.
When you’re traveling with other people, there are two things I learned quite quickly: You have to be patient and you have to be willing to compromise. I have tons of friends back home whom I love and get along with very well, but I would never travel with them. When studying abroad, you don’t really get much of a choice as to who will be joining you on these journeys. You usually just end up traveling with the other people in your program.
As idealized as it may seem through pictures, traveling is intense and who you go with can make a very big difference in the outcome of your trip. When planning these weekend getaways together you’re taking a leap of faith because you really don’t know how you are all going to function together as a group. Everyone is different and has their own personal tastes and methods of traveling, and it’s more than likely that you will occasionally clash over some matters.
Luckily, my flat mates and I are a perfect balance of different personalities, which allowed us to get along just fine (and I say this wholeheartedly, not just because I know they’ll read this). In the end as a student studying abroad you never really know what type of people you’ll be exploring the world with. Keep in mind that things are never going to be perfect, because with traveling they never are. Just remember to be patient and willing to listen, and in the end, just make the best of it.

Let’s all just take a deep breath.
I know, it was a tough one to sit through. I was there, too. And go ahead, make that one last nerd joke if you really think it will make you feel better.
But now that we’ve had a couple days to sleep on it, let’s remember what actually happened last weekend and where it stands in the grand scheme of things.
One game. Not the end of the world, and not even the end of USC’s season. There are still plenty of chances to make up for it and a lot of football left on the schedule.
Of course, it was not a good start to the conference slate. The road to the top four is certainly much harder now. The Trojans got halfway there after starting at No. 8, and climbing to No. 6 going into Stanford, but fell all the way to No. 19.
But it wasn’t as bad as you probably think. Neither the game itself nor the implications of the result seriously changed my outlook for the season. The Trojans, without a doubt, still have the possibility and capability of making the College Football Playoff.
In fact, the advance statistics on USC are still very positive even after the loss. ESPN’s Football Power Index ranks USC as the  No. 7 team in the country. That’s best out of the Pac-12, as the Trojans rank ahead of   No. 15 Oregon, No. 17 Stanford and No. 18 UCLA. The FPI also says USC still has the best chance of winning the conference. It gives USC a 34.2 percent chance, with Stanford in second at 25 percent, Oregon with a 16.1 percent chance and UCLA with a 15 percent chance. The AP sees it a little differently, with UCLA at No. 9, Oregon at No. 13 and Stanford at No. 21, but I think the FPI is very much worth noting.
As expected, there was a lot of criticism directed at USC defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox for the team’s performance. I usually like playing devil’s advocate for unpopular on-field coaching decisions, and I think any calls for his termination, or even demotion, are very premature at this point.
My personal perspective on the game is that USC didn’t have any huge problems in the game plan. Plenty have said it was too conservative and didn’t adjust in the second half, but I think a lot of that is unsubstantiated generalization. Part of the first half, I think USC played too much zone coverage, but I remember a lot more man coverage in the second half. Likewise, I can remember enough plays where USC brought five or six guys to pressure the quarterback.
What the game comes down to is that Stanford’s offense greatly exceeded expectations. Kevin Hogan had one of his best performances as quarterback. He showed uncanny mobility, with three runs of over 10 yards, two of which were on long third downs and several plays where he escaped pressure to make big throws. Complement that with a strong, well-established running game from Stanford, and you just have to tip your cap to the Cardinal. Stanford was firing on all cylinders.
The interesting thing about the result is that in recent history, Wilcox had actually had a lot of success against Stanford. During the three previous meetings, going back to his time at Washington,      Wilcox-led defensive units held the Cardinal to only four touchdowns and four field goals. This obviously indicates that Wilcox’s bend-but-don’t-break philosophy is not inherently flawed against power teams. Stanford head coach David Shaw, who himself receives a lot of criticism for conservative play calling, was unusually successful at distributing the ball to all his playmakers. If an evenly matched opponent finally figures out how to beat you after four tries, that doesn’t mean you don’t know what you’re doing. We could just as easily criticize coaches who adjust too early and aren’t “sticking to what got you there.”
It’s crucial to acknowledge Stanford as a rival. The program has been to two more Rose Bowls than USC has in the past six years, and now holds a 5-2 series advantage since then. USC is still a better team this year, and the Trojans should have won, but the loss shouldn’t have been shocking to anyone. The Stanford student body probably would not have stormed the field if that same result had happened in Palo Alto. The fact that Stanford lost to Northwestern is indication that good teams often underperform at the beginning of the year — not that Stanford is not a good team.
The biggest thing to take away from the game is that it’s too early to say anything conclusive about the defense. It was the first real game for many of the talented freshman starters. Stanford’s 8-12 third down conversion rate is still a really small sample size.
In fact, it’s too early to say anything about anyone. No. 1 Ohio State was almost upset this weekend by Northern Illinois, No. 3 Ole Miss was gifted five turnovers by Alabama but still only won by one possession, UCLA’s quarterback Josh Rosen looked very much like a freshman against No. 22 BYU and Oregon has since switched starting quarterbacks since its three-point loss to No. 2 Michigan State. The conference, and national playoff, is wide open.
With all that being said, USC has a uniquely difficult road. FPI ranked USC’s remaining schedule the third toughest in the country, and only gave the Trojans a 4 percent chance of going undefeated the rest of the year.
But the Trojans very much still control their destiny. Winning out guarantees the Trojans will at least win the head-to-head tiebreaker against anyone in the Pac-12 South. Losing to Stanford, a North division team, is honestly not that significant. The Trojan’s matchup with Arizona State this weekend is without a doubt more crucial.
The Trojans would possibly earn a rematch with the Cardinal in the Pac-12 championship game if they take care of the Pac-12 South. That game just might be a de facto quarterfinal in the national playoff, and I would feel really confident in this team in that rematch.

The Trojans responded to their first loss of the season with one of their most lively practices yet. It was visibly louder, as coaches and players shouted words of encouragement to each other.
“I can help the run game by being a vocal guy to get the offensive line together,” said redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler, after Tuesday’s practice. “I think getting in on the sideline and getting them pumped up, which I have been trying to do a lot.”
After a 41-31 loss to Stanford, this close-knit USC team is stressing accountability as key to moving on.
“Guys admit that they are wrong and learn from it and then move on,” Kessler said. “And it’s cool, you can call them out in the meeting room, and then they respond to it. Instead of putting their head down or being upset, they stand up and let the guys know that they will fix it. And that is what you need to be successful after a loss.”
Kessler continued his impressive play this season against Stanford, completing 25 of 32 passes for 272 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions. Unfortunately, his counterpart, Kevin Hogan, did as well. Without adequate pressure from the Trojan defense, he completed 18 of 23 passes for 279 yards and two touchdowns.
“The problem, when we missed [Hogan] our rush lane integrity was not good, and we allowed for him to escape the pocket whether it was on the perimeter or through the b-gap on a couple of other instances that he took advantage of and hurt us on,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “So that is what we need to clean up. We are trying to go sack the quarterback, and we are going to continue [making] him uncomfortable.”
Not only did the Trojans allow Stanford to throw the ball, they also allowed their rushing attack, led by freshman Christian McCaffrey, 115 yards. The USC defense allowed Stanford to score on seven of its nine possessions and convert eight of 12 third down conversions.
“I just felt like in the run game, we didn’t knock back the line of scrimmage enough,” Sarkisian said. “I felt like the game was played too much on the line of scrimmage or on our side of the line of scrimmage. We didn’t have enough tackles for losses or penetrations. We had a couple, but not nearly enough against a quality opponent on first and 10.”
Along with Kessler’s performance, another positive takeaway’s from Saturday’s game was evidently USC’s run game, which the coaches emphasized last week was essential in defeating Stanford. Though the game plan worked well early on, as USC scored touchdowns on three of its first four possessions, Hogan’s play on third down often left the USC running backs on the sideline. The Trojan offense scored only 10 points over the final 39 minutes and 29 seconds.
Third downs continued to be an issue for the USC offense too, in a game that Stanford dominated in time of possession and number of plays run.
“I thought we got a little bit better on third down with the 40 percent, on four out of 10. But our mark is always 50 percent or better,” offensive coordinator Clay Helton said. “Our job right now is to score every time we get the ball, and that is what we tell the offense. Our job was to score 42 that night.”
While the Trojans did score 31 points, they will have to prepare for games with similarly high scores in the pass-happy          Pac-12,  which will certainly be a challenge against an Arizona State pass defense that is ranked ninth in the nation.
“In the second half, score more points, double the opponents score and establish the run,” said running back Tre Madden, when asked how USC’s offense can improve heading into the desert. “Being physical and being able to put the game away. And that is what we are going to focus on.”
“We didn’t expect to lose, but it’s football,” said Madden, who left Saturday’s game with a calf injury.
Madden said he will be fully able to play against Arizona State.
“They wanted to win, obviously, and we just have to move on and focus on this next Pac-12 South game, because all of our goals are still in front of us,” he said. “We’re just trying to take it week by week.”

With midterm season just around the corner, and campus activities heating up, the stress of balancing academic and extracurricular commitments may have already begun creeping up on students. Ambitious, and motivated by a multitude interests — the average USC student may find that their key problem when it comes to extracurricular activities isn’t finding them and joining them, but rather struggling to participate in all the activities that interest them. While it is never a bad thing to have a variety of interests, too large a myriad can leave a student overstretched, and potentially unable to adequately participate in each activity to the extent that they had anticipated. A balance between your extracurricular activities and academics is necessary for all ambitious Trojans. Here are some tips to make sure you maintain this balance throughout the semester:
1. Study with your organization
Chances are high that you’ll share classes or a major with at least a handful of students in the organizations you belong to. Take advantage of this, and study with your organization. You will be able to bond with your fellow club members while getting important classwork completed. Even if no one is studying for the same classes as you, reserving a study room and working together can be equally as efficient, and infinitely more enjoyable.
2. Choose different organizations that both align and deviate from your area of study
Participating in organizations associated with your academic studies will allow you to extend the lessons you learn in class to real world practices or interactions. Pre-med students can benefit from joining organizations such as the pre-med fraternity Alpha Epsilon Delta, or the Emergency Medical Services of USC to gain networking skills and hands-on experience. In some cases, these major-related extracurricular activities could also count for class credit or extra credit, allowing students to simultaneously work toward academic and extracurricular goals.
While students may intuitively choose activities that align with their majors or intended career paths, it is important to explore other interests that deviate from the topics covered in classes . Joining a cultural organization, dance team or sports team can help students take a break from their academic areas, and help them develop different skills or just have fun.
3. Quality is always better than quantity
Your resume may appear more robust and the list of organizations you’re involved with may run on like movie credits, but stretching yourself too thin, across too many activities may prevent you from reaching your goals within each organization. It is always better to become invested in the organizations and activities that add the most to your college experience, and allow you to grow as a student rather than sporadically participate in lots of activities and struggle to become invested in any one of them. As a plus, your resume will look even more impressive when it’s supported by your strong commitment to a few organizations that exemplify your passions.
4. Have a rest day (or two)!
While it may seem like all your extracurricular activities perfectly line up in a tight mosaic of meetings and events, having a full week of back-to-back classes and meetings may leave you too exhausted to study, finish homework or socialize with friends and family. Having rest days when you can take a breather and relax are important for mental health and happiness. Sometimes the best way to fulfill your academic and extracurricular goals is to spend time regrouping and relaxing so every once in a while remember to take a nap, eat Korean BBQ with friends or sit down with a good book!

It’s hard to pinpoint The Mantles’ exact sound. In their latest album, All Odds End, the music transports listeners back to the Beach Boys-era with lead singer Michael Olivares’ easygoing voice while simultaneously keeping the songs alive with backbeats reminiscent of tracks by The Strokes or The Flaming Lips. In a time when the alternative music genre is being taken over by the electronic dance music industry, All Odds End puts indie music lovers’ worries to rest with its eclectic style and vivid lyrics.
Back with their third album, The Mantles prove that their infectious cheer is a running theme in their music. All Odds End starts with “Island,” an upbeat song that brings out Olivares’ unique voice. The lyrics, however, reveal a deeper meaning behind the optimistic melody. With “No address to the island / New address now you ought to / Learn to read the stars again / Wait, they’ve burned out,”  “Island” highlights the vulnerability associated with feeling isolated.
Another highlight of the album is “Lately,” a song about unrequited love. The track is weaved with a slower beat, less reminiscent of the hopeful disposition the album starts out with. “Lately” highlights lead guitarist Justin Loney’s ability to showcase his runs. The subject of “Lately” might make the average listener feel jaded, but the lyrics add dimensionality to what would otherwise be a sappy song. The chorus chimes, “On and on the edge of you calling / What’s small enough to keep / Can I find you out there / Lately, it’s not likely.”
But the standout song of the bunch is “Police My Love.” Showing off keyboardist Carly Putnam, “Police My Love” echoes the current revival of the ’80s pop sound. Loney also ties in the song together again with his guitar backdrop, emphasizing the band’s cohesion. As Olivares croons, “From the bottom rising up / The untamed human heart / Can you release my love? / Can you police my love?” listeners will be reminded of David Bowie.
Other than “Police My Love,” the most distinctive song of the album, other tracks from All Odds End start to blend together after listening through the album once. Though some might think that this makes the band’s third effort quite flat, the consistency allows for a strong album overall. Some albums feature a couple memorable singles, while others are an enjoyable album altogether. The Mantles have achieved the latter.
Over the past couple of years, The Mantles have bubbled under the music industry’s radar. With their newest album, All Odds End, they are sure to impress alternative music enthusiasts who are seeking a new, eclectic sound.
All Odds End comes out on Oct. 16.

Tucked away on Broadway and 9th Street, Pilates Plus is a hidden gem amid the hustle of its busy Downtown location. Despite its position across from the Orpheum Theatre, the studio is easy to miss without a keen eye on the lookout for its gray and yellow signage. One of the first businesses on Broadway, Pilates Plus was opened by owner and instructor Judy Hong in 2008. Hong admits that the location was a big risk that has since paid off. The area developed quickly and is now full of restaurants, businesses and apartments. Pilates Plus attracted quite a following, so much so that Hong and co-owner Joy Plas opened a second location in Long Beach several years later in 2011. The urban location hasn’t hindered the business of the studio, as most clients live or work around the area, and those who travel usually find metered parking or park in a multitude of lots nearby.
Pilates Plus follows the LaGree system of Pilates, equipped with the Megaformer, a modified Reformer designed by Sebastien LaGree. Through this intimidating contraption, Pilates Plus is able to offer challenging and strong workouts without damage to joints. As Judy explained, the workout minimizes injury but is also great for people with injuries, as exercises can be easily modified according to each client’s needs. Pilates maintains form and principle, promising an intense workout for clients no matter their fitness or experience level. Each class caps out at about 10 students, ensuring individual attention while maintaining the energy of a group setting, The 50-minute-long classes are filled with people who have limited time but still want a killer total-body workout.
The studio offers three different classes: standard Pilates, which I took; Pilates Form & Technique, recommended for both new and experienced clients hoping to shape and perfect their technique; and Pilates + Rev Cycle, a combination class of Pilates and indoor cycling. Classes run seven days a week to accommodate any busy schedule, with weekday classes ranging from 6 a.m. to 5:30 or 7:30 p.m., depending on the day. Pilates Plus offers a special rate for USC students: $189 for unlimited classes per month instead of the normal $229 per month, as well as a buddy special through which new clients’ first month of unlimited classes is $99 when they sign up with a friend. The studio offers new faces their first class for free, but classes can also be bought by one, 10 or 20 sessions.
I admit I severely misjudged the workout. Never having done pilates before, I asked friends what to expect, to which one friend described pilates as “yoga but with more abs.” I liked this idea and pictured my experience as some sort of group stretching, surrounded by mood lighting, candles and soothing sounds. I could not have been more wrong.
Upon entering the small studio, it was clear that Pilates Plus meant business. The space was neat and clean, with everything in its place. Megaformer machines lined the mirrored wall to my right, with indoor cycling machines toward the back of the studio. Though I expected the class to be small, I was surprised and intimidated to discover I was one of only two students in the class. A third joined us later. I could tell the other student was experienced, so I felt nervous about being the newbie — I’m not usually a fan of individualized attention. My instructor, Juliet, however, was very kind and patient with me in explaining the basics of pilates, the machine and the mechanics of the class.
After asking if I had any injuries she should be aware of, Juliet explained that if I was going to take anything easy, it should be the arm portion of the workout because the leg exercises were where I’d really feel the burn. I happily agreed and carefully climbed onto the Megaformer, unaware of exactly what I was about to encounter. Juliet started us off with some lunges and leg stretches, which seemed easy enough until it was my turn to do it. It wasn’t until Juliet pumped up the music and came out with a headset several minutes later that I truly realized what I was in for.
Like yoga, pilates has a lot of terms for its positions and exercises. One of these names is pulsing, which consists of swaying or pushing in and out of a lunge or other exercise. Pulsing quickly became the death of me, as I’d try to push my limits on Juliet’s cue. A few minutes into the workout, and my legs were already shaking like a leaf trying to hold a lunge and keep correct form, the core of the pilates workout.
Things got serious when Juliet announced it was time for pilates burpees. I’m not a fan of burpees in general, so I knew this would be a personal accomplishment for me. One by one, I looked in the mirror to see beads of sweat quickly forming on my forehead; I was convinced this was the hardest workout I’d ever done. Though she was very kind in giving me personal attention and tips for modifying the exercises according to my skill level, just as I thought I had gotten the hang of an exercise, Juliet would come by and tell me to straighten my leg, raise my back or push it just a little bit further.
I had never felt so relieved when Juliet announced the end of class. I had pushed myself to the limit, and I had spent the class on the easiest resistance level. My legs felt like they could barely support the weight of my body, but that was exactly what I wanted in a workout. My class at Pilates Plus was brutal and completely intense. In just 50 minutes, I felt like I had worked harder than I ever had before. As Juliet informed me, it usually takes people around five classes to get a hang of this intense total-body workout, but until then, “Advil helps.”

Located in an obscure corner of 1st Street in the Arts District of downtown Los Angeles, Osso can be easily missed when walking by. Previously known as One-Eyed Gypsy, Osso — which means “bone” in Italian — has reopened with new owners and an entirely new vibe. While One-Eyed Gypsy was focused more on bohemian extravagance, the new owners took down many of the old decorations for a more modest feel. The restaurant and bar now exude an ambiance that is both intimate and relaxed, created by the dim lighting and upbeat music playing at a low volume.
The restaurant’s menu consists of traditional American comfort food such as fried chicken with potato salad, more eclectic and decorative dishes such as the foie gras torchon and smoked yellowtail toast and a variety of snacks such as onion rings, beef jerky and popcorn to be shared around the dinner table. Chef Nick Montgomery prepares Osso’s American dishes in a unique way, drawing influence from both the South and his various experiences cooking in restaurants across the country, including Momofuku in New York City and Blackbird in Chicago.
The fried chicken, Osso’s most famous dish, tastes as delicious as it looks and smells. The skin is crispy and tantalizing while the meat on the inside is smooth and juicy. The potato salad serves as the perfect side dish to the chicken with its delectable barbeque sauce and paprika seasoning. By contrast, the carrot top tortellini in broth is equally satisfying in a more subdued manner. The tortellini, stuffed with chicken thigh and foie gras, with hazelnuts and carrot confit sprinkled across the bowl, makes for a dining experience so enriching that diners would think they were in a five-star French restaurant instead of a Downtown hole-in-the-wall.
Unlike many restaurants in downtown Los Angeles, Osso’s dishes range from affordable to pricey, a reflection of its menu’s many options. In addition, Osso prides itself on being a fair wage restaurant by adding a 20 percent service fee to every customer’s check but not requiring a tip. Customers will find that Osso is not a restaurant that targets a certain demographic; its broad price range and eclectic menu attract visitors from all ages and income levels.
In addition to its exceptional menu, Osso’s customer service is a well-balanced combination of attentive, but not overbearing friendliness. The water jug will never be empty without someone rushing to fill it for you, and the waiter will bring you the check before you ask for it.
Those who are not already won over by Osso will be intrigued by its plans to incorporate more live music in the restaurant. With a stage leftover from the One-Eyed Gypsy era, customers can look forward to live music performances. Much like the decor of the rest of the restaurant, the stage gives off a rustic style that many visitors might describe as unkempt, but that ties in with the theme of the restaurant perfectly.
Though many college students might not be old enough to try Osso’s well-known cocktails and beer, the restaurant has many other highlights such as its pleasant food, various flavors and exceptional service. With its one-of-a-kind menu and relaxed modern bohemian atmosphere, it is a restaurant that any foodie, or fried-chicken lover, must try.

Oftentimes when we scroll through the headlines, we see titles such as, “Acai berry: How to lose weight quick” or “Quinoa: The way to a healthier life.” We are introduced to so-called superfoods that promise to do magical things, all the while thinking, “How is that possible?” Soon enough, we find ourselves on the fifth day of our kale-salads-for-lunch diet, growing more irritable, hungry and confused as to why our daily dose of the latest sensational superfood didn’t do the trick. Well, the so-called trick to getting the most out of superfoods is getting to its core – the nutrients in these foods that make them so exceptional. For college students, especially, chia seeds is a one-of-a-kind option. 
Packed with omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and fiber, chia seeds are one of a few foods that can rightfully claim the title of “superfood.” Chia seeds come from the South American plant Salvia Hispanica, and its role in cuisine dates back to the Aztecs and the Mayans. 
Though Chia seeds are relatively new to American culture, they have already found their way into our hearts – literally. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential in reducing blood pressure by cleaning up our arteries and lowering cholesterol. Chia seeds also have antioxidants, which serve to protect cells from free radicals which are the natural, but harmful, byproducts of aging. Studies show that while antioxidant supplements have not been connected with decreased cardiovascular risk, natural sources of antioxidants in foods, such as chia seeds, reduce the risk of heart disease. Fiber, the majority of the carbohydrates in chia seeds, makes you feel full and and also aid in digestion. 
Catherine Ulbricht, co-founder of Natural Standard Research Collaboration and researcher warns, however, that chia seeds have not been connected to weight loss and that people suffering from high blood pressure should ask a physician before adding chia seeds to their diet. 
Chia seeds are not recommended for weight loss, but college students can easily incorporate chia seeds into their daily regimen to add nutrients without changing their diet too drastically. For example, start the day by adding chia seeds to your yogurt at breakfast or sprinkle chia seeds over your salad at lunch. If you have extra dining hall swipes, stop by Café 84 and try their new selection of chia seed drinks.
Though food fads often lack true scientific basis, chia seeds offer the unique combination of nutrition, affordability and convenience.

In early September, a Tumblr account run collectively by Roski M.F.A. students since December 2012 was mysteriously and abruptly shut down. The blog followed the resignation from the incoming class of first year M.F.A. students from the Roski School of Fine Arts earlier this year. When the class resigned, the students published an open letter citing concerns over not knowing what the curriculum would be, “other than that it will be different from what it was when [they] enrolled and is currently being implemented by administrators outside of [their] field of study,” as well as not knowing whether they would graduate with twice the amount of debt they had anticipated upon enrollment.
When one of the students sent an inquiry to Tumblr after it removed the Roski blog, they learned that the popular blogging platform had been contacted by one of USC’s lawyers, who had requested the site be taken down. The Roski administration released a statement justifying their move on the basis of copyright infringement and said the page could have been mistaken for an official one, since the school name and address appeared on the bottom of the blog. Taking down the blog, however, effectively removed public dissent.
The same collective of students has since reconstructed the same blog with a slightly different URL.
For the most part, the content of the blog includes pictures of M.F.A. students at work in the studio, of their completed projects and of informational posters about thesis topics and presentations. As a senior looking into graduate programs myself, albeit not M.F.A. programs, this is exactly the kind of information a prospective applicant might be interested in. The blog contained content curated by actual students going through the program, rather than carefully orchestrated advertising content put out by the University itself.
However, some of the content on the blog may have seemed subversive to the school’s administration, therefore heightening their interest in shutting it down. In addition to the letter from the incoming M.F.A. class which unanimously withdrew all the students’ enrollment, the blog posted a letter and petition addressed to the USC administration condemning its actions since the class’s withdrawal in May. The petition demands the resignation of Dean Erica Muhl and, as of September, it has received over 880 signatures.
The top of the post containing the letter to the administration reads “Demand USC’s accountability for its administrators’ actions. Sign the class of 2015’s petition now,” with the last sentence linking to the petition. Another post, entitled, “Letter to our Supporters,” expresses a desire for “greater transparency and equitability in the increasingly corporatized system of higher education.” Both the call for administrative accountability and the concern about increasingly corporatized higher education probably resonate with millions of other university students in the United States who are graduating with increasingly high rates of debt.
Whether one believes in online petitions as possible agents of social change, these posts are important public records of dissent. A university has everything to gain by portraying themselves in the most positive light, even if this sometimes means inaccurately conveying real experiences and, worse, erasing the voices of its actual students.
This upcoming Saturday, USC’s Visions & Voices program is scheduled to host a lecture and workshop on “Art as Social Practice,” which is apparently an appealing theory to the University in the context of neighborhood revitalization and community engagement — a relatively innocuous message aimed at a broad audience. But when students paying a salary’s worth of yearly income to study art try to make institutional changes, the role of artists as activists is apparently no longer appealing.

Citizens often see university education as an economic equalizer, a way for lower class underdogs to meet richer academic peers in the laureled halls of America’s finest institutions, regardless of wealth and status. Admits to prestigious colleges are touted as people who’ve “made it”; through blood, sweat and tears, they’ve independently paved paths for a better life.
Recently, however, glaring inequities in the compositions of top schools’ student bodies have raised questions over many top universities’ claims to economic, racial and gender diversity on their campuses. Administrations of select elite American universities create hoards of money, putting endowments in investments while student financial aid remains stagnant.
A recent article in the New York Times displayed metrics comparing the ratio of top liberal arts schools’ endowments with the percentage of their students on Pell Grants, or need-based federal grants awarded toward the pursuit of undergraduate study. Results are mixed; top-tier universities such as Princeton, Yale and the California Institute of Technology boast endowments upwards of $700,000 per students, but admit relatively few (between 12 and 14 percent) of low-income undergraduates. In contrast, some universities with relatively smaller endowments such as Wesleyan, Susquehanna and Saint Mary’s boast student populations with substantially larger economic diversity. At USC, a school with an endowment that can serve each student around $118,000, about 25 percent of undergraduates receive Pell Grants, the fourth highest rate in the nation. A recent report published by Stanford professor Caroline Hoxby and Harvard professor Christopher Avery provides more proof that high-achieving, low-income students don’t even apply to the top-ranked universities they’re more than qualified for.
People attribute this gap mainly to a lack of knowledge rather than issues with instruction quality. Follow-up studies highlighted substantial increases in low-income applicants from schools that recruited at low-income schools or even left stacks of fliers at counseling centers. Despite public debate, educational equity involves more than tinkering with acceptance rates. It includes the support of an involved pipeline for underserved communities from high school applications to college graduations, involving services ranging from high school outreach and recruitment to academic services once students enroll. Unfortunately, fierce debates about affirmative action sometimes pave over student needs both before and after matriculation into universities. Even today, first-generation college students experience obnoxiously low graduation rates and struggle with adjustment at four-year universities.
Though educational studies often agree that equity depends on a support network from high school to college, universities at the forefront of American rankings rarely recruit from underserved districts. A recent NPR interview with Malcolm Gladwell, author and New Yorker writer, notes large swaths of top-tier schools’ massive endowments are earmarked toward private equity fund managers. One of the biggest alleged culprits was Yale, where only $170 million of the university’s $24 billion endowment went toward student financial aid. Almost triple that was spent on equity fees themselves. Similar trends were seen at Harvard, Princeton, Stanford and the University of Texas, all elite schools receiving massive gifts from wealthy donors. University endowments, however, are exempt from corporate income taxes, and citizens continue to subsidize funds through tax breaks while students remain paying large sums for tuition.
Educational equity is more than an issue of passing an affirmative action bill, debating over racial quotas or changing admissions standards. It’s a holistic approach toward educational equity that recognizes achievement and provides developmental resources during students’ college experience. Currently, colleges obsessed with income from tuition actively recruit students who can pay full price rather than those with talent. Universities across the country may struggle to find solutions for providing full services to students, but schools with near billions in the hands of private fund managers should not be retracting from using that money to recruit from lower-class communities, mainly of color, who need it. At the very least, American citizens should not be subsidizing that money with tax breaks; tuition money that students funnel should empower the communities around it, not sit in hoards as student services for minority groups remain stagnant.
Especially at USC, one of the largest research institutions in the nation, diversity is a selling point that attracts the second-largest international population in the nation. The administration hangs 107 flags at the Von KleinSmid Center and boasts of its diversity on buildings and pamphlets alike. Organizations such as Troy Camp, the Joint Education Project and USC Science Outreach offer valuable services for increasing student retention and recruitment in the Los Angeles community. The school, however, can take a stronger stance on diversity; with only 2.2 percent of the University’s endowment directed toward undergraduate scholarship aid, we can all agree that too many students graduate with too much debt. Approaching endowments with students in mind, both at our school and beyond, may create a diversity that truly empowers communities rather than being another selling point or check mark.

Foo Fighters delivered a timeless performance to fans at The Forum this past Monday. Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
The Inglewood sun is setting and the sky takes on a blood orange hue. It is a dramatic scene fit for an evening with the Foo Fighters at The Forum, a venue that bears uncanny resemblance to the Roman Coliseum.  
The average age of the concert-goers is predictably a little older than, say, that of a Drake concert. Still, the wide-reaching appeal of the Foo Fighters is made apparent by the mix of young, old and really old faces. One bearded man in his ‘70s wears a giant smile as he walks around, beer in hand, in a Motorhead T-Shirt. A few feet away a young girl proudly displays her “Dave Grohl is My Hero” shirt. 
I get a $13 cheesesteak and wait for the show to begin. Entering The Forum, I’m immediately reminded that the Foo Fighters are one of the biggest rock bands in the world. Stadium rock is still alive. Hanging over the stage is a giant wall of speakers, menacingly facing the audience, threatening to melt everyone’s faces off.
With no warning, the lights dim.
The small portion of the crowd that is actually inside the stadium howls their approval. The opening act, blues-rocker Gary Clark Jr. takes the stage and without hesitation jumps into a heavy-hitting jam session — pure, unfettered rock ‘n’ roll. The audience is transported to the deep south as Clark churns out his soulful blues licks. The bassist to his right wears a poncho and cowboy boots, completing the pastoral aesthetic. Clark’s shrieking guitar finds its way into your bones, and the rhythm of the bass drum becomes your heartbeat.
Clark transitions from high octane blues rock to smooth ballad and back again as the crowd steadily fills the stadium. During his finale, Clark kicks his fingers into overdrive and delivers his most impressive solo. Yellow lights turn on and move through the crowd. Then, just as unceremoniously as they entered, Gary Clark Jr. and his band exit the stage.
The lights come on and a Foo Fighters flag tumbles down. The crowd roars. They eagerly anticipate the arrival of former Nirvana drummer and current Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl and his crew.
After a 20-minute intermission, a familiar scream pierces the audience’s ears. The lights dim. The crowd goes wild as the curtain drops and the Foo’s break into “All My Life.” The tour is called the “Broken Leg Tour,” simply because Grohl has a broken leg. What does Dave Grohl make out of the situation? As usual, he makes it the stuff of legend. Center-stage Grohl sits on a magnificent throne, rocking harder than some singers with two fully functional legs. There could be no better symbolism for the Foo Fighter’s endurance. Many bands have come and gone since 1995, but the Foo Fighters have persisted. For the last two decades, they have been one of the most consistent bands in rock, never failing to produce another hit, another great album.
Dave’s throne glides from the main down a runway to a mini stage in the middle of the mosh pit. It is a ridiculous and hilarious spectacle. Dave relishes it. He pauses takes a look around. The crowd eats it up. The Foo Fighters jump into their next song.
Dave’s singing has also held up surprisingly well. He still has a killer scream, which he shows off any chance he gets.
Relentlessly, the Foo plays hit after hit — “Learn to Fly,” “Times Like These,” “My Hero,” and more. They are obviously not tired of playing these songs, and their fans are not tired of hearing them. They sing along with songs released in 1997 and songs released just last year. It doesn’t matter — Foo Fighters will always be Foo Fighters.
During the interlude of the 2007 classic “The Pretender” Dave’s throne is transported front and center once again, and he begins interacting with the crowd, as he is known to do at concerts.
“I love it when a crowd this big makes me sweat so f—-g much.” 
“Turn the lights up I wanna see you.” The crowd rages and throws their Dio horns up. Dave approves and does a little broken-leg dance, while guitarist Pat Smear revs up a solo.
“I wanna see the energy like this all night. Can we do this all night?” The crowd roars in deafening affirmation.
When the song finally ended after three minutes more of jamming, the audience gave a solid two-minute ovation. One would think the concert just ended. The crowd more than fulfilled its promise of keeping the energy high throughout the night.
“I almost had to cancel this tour because of this little incident,” Dave tells the crowd towards the end of the show. “But that wasn’t gonna happen. I got a throne, and here we are.” The crowd shows their appreciation. “Kids, make a band and get a throne. Because in my 20 years of touring with the Foo Fighters, I’ve never had more fun.”
And he meant it. It’s been 20 years, and the Foo Fighters show no sign of letting up.
