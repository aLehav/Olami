A USC student and professor were recognized this weekend for their work helping children receive life-saving heart surgery in developing countries.
Rachel Lester, a senior majoring in cognitive science, received The Save A Child’s Heart Foundation’s Young Leadership Award Sunday at the foundation’s third annual West Coast gala. Carol and Gary Winkler presented the award to Lester, whose video “Superman’s Got Nothing On Israel,” featuring Save A Child’s Heart, won first place in the international Israel Video Network contest in March.
Save A Child’s Heart is an international nonprofit organization located at the Wolfson Medical Center in Holon, Israel. The foundation provides cardiac surgery to children who may not otherwise be able to afford it. To date, the organization has saved the lives of over 3,400 children from Africa, South America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
Lester first heard about the organization as a freshman, when SC Students For Israel, a club she was involved in, hosted a fundraiser for SACH. She officially joined one and a half years later.
“I took fall semester of sophomore year off to volunteer on Israeli army bases, and while I was there, I started hearing about SACH again,” Lester said. “Since I had already been feeling like I wanted a change of pace from my program, I made the spur-of-the-moment decision to contact SACH about volunteering with them. A week later, I was living in the house with 16 Ethiopian and Tanzanian kids.”
Lester also spent a week as a live-in volunteer at the SACH house in 2014, an experience she has cherished ever since.
“It was one of the best weeks of my whole life,” Lester said. “The kids were so kind to each other and to me.”
The second USC honoree was professor Brandy Hattendorf, who received the International Humanitarian Award. Hattendorf serves as a board member for the SACH West Coast Advisory committee, and is working with the SACH Israeli team to create American/Israeli medical teams and expand the SACH international efforts.
Isabel Shanahan, who works with Save A Child’s Heart as a public relations representative, spoke about the two USC honorees and their work for the organization, as well as how other USC students can get involved with the organization.
“The organization selected them for the amazing work they have done,” Shanahan said. “Hattendorf has worked with the patients for years, and Rachel … is such a great advocate. USC students can get involved by going online to Save A Child’s Heart’s website and just contacting them and going to their events.”
Nancy Pardo, who serves as the West Coast Young Leadership Director for SACH, said Lester’s hands-on volunteering efforts in Israel as well as Hattendorf’s work at the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles made them ideal candidates for the awards they received.
“Lester has been involved with the organization for years,” Pardo said. “We met with her and were in awe with her accomplishments. Hattendorf … was a superb person to be honored.”
Additionally, the Compassionate Heart Award was presented to actor and comedian Jamie Kennedy for speaking out about his own heart health issues.
Correction: A previous version of this article contained errors. It stated that Rachel Lester was presented the Lauren Winkler National Young Leadership award by Chloe Lukasiak. She received it from Carol and Gary Winkler. Lester also did not join SACH her freshman year, but officially got involved a year and a half later. Finally, Isabel Shanahan has not personally worked with SACH for three years.

Students, faculty and government officials gathered to discuss the future of California Wednesday morning at Town and Gown. “Economic and Political Challenges Facing California,” hosted by the Sol Price School of Public Policy, was part of Dean Jack H. Knott’s first Policy Breakfast Series.
The event featured California State Treasurer John Chiang and was moderated by Rodney Ramcharan, an associate professor of public policy and the director of research at the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate. The Price School’s Athenian Society, a philanthropic organization, organized the event. 
“The impetus for this discussion is to convene civic and business leaders to share their in-depth expertise on critical policy topics and highly debated issues facing our communities,” Knott said. “Our aim is to inspire constructive dialogue and foster a community of engaged and informed citizens.”
After Knott outlined some of the issues California currently faces, including economic inequality and other fiscal challenges, Ramcharan began the dialogue by asking about Chiang’s economic background and the duties that ensue as the overseer of California’s investments and finances. 
Chiang explained that he is the state banker who is responsible for California’s daily investments. 
“On a daily basis, we are investing about $80 billion in short-term cash, and our principal statutory charges is to make sure we don’t lose capital,” Chiang said.
Chiang stated that as the child of immigrant parents, he has experienced discrimination from an early age, which inspired him to work in public service. He established himself as a liberal with strong values that focused on the themes of love and support, which propelled him make a difference in improving lives. 
“Equal rights are important, and what’s bad about liking and valuing each other? I get to to make laws that try to help people,” Chiang said.
Ramcharan asked Chiang about climate change and the impact it has on California and its funding. As an agricultural state that commonly experiences droughts, California, Chiang explained, should expect regulatory and legislative changes that would allow the state to more efficiently use its water. Chiang also said that the state needs to consider pricing mechanisms and market intervention in order to fix the issues it faces.
Ramcharan also inquired about DebtWatch, an award-winning website Chiang created in 2015 that enables the public to view three decades of debt-related information issued by state and local governments. 
“I put up the history of $1.5 trillion worth of borrowing by all levels of government in the last 30 years in the state of California,” Chiang said.
Chiang stressed the importance of transparency in the current economic and political situation, stating that governments need to be held responsible for their policies and actions. 
“People need to know how much is being borrowed, how much is being used properly and what is being paid back on time, because there are implications for our sustainable financing,” Chiang said.

Ellice Wang | Daily TrojanSpeak out · USC and UCLA students walked out of class Wednesday afternoon to express their dissatisfaction with the election of Donald Trump and the surge of hate crimes that took place shortly after Election Day.
USC and UCLA students held a joint walkout across their campuses Wednesday afternoon, urging administrators to provide a space for minority communities and anyone else affected by the election to voice their opinions and frustrations.
About 100 USC students gathered around Traveler at 3 p.m. to express their opinions about President-elect Donald Trump and speak on related issues of discrimination, white supremacy, immigration and cultural identity. In addition, organizers of the walkout provided a petition for USC Student Affairs to create a sanctuary campus at USC for undocumented students. The organizers also provided letters to sign and send to the electors to change their vote before it is cast on Dec. 19.
Tomas Mier, an organizer for the walkout and a writer for the Daily Trojan, said it was important to give a chance for members of the diverse USC community to have their voices heard.
“USC is a place where there is a lot of different colors of skin, different ethnicities, races and sexual orientations,” Mier said. “I feel like it’s important to stand up to the divisive rhetoric that was spread by the president-elect.”
Many students came to voice their frustrations on the outcome of the election. Nicole Hajiwara, a junior majoring in communication, was not only upset by the election results, but also by the number of people who voted for Trump. She hopes to make a change by signing the petition for a sanctuary campus.
“It was kind of a shock to me, this whole election, not that Trump won but that so many people in this country have so much hate in their hearts,” Hajiwara said. “The fact that he ran his entire election on hate, it is really disappointing to me.”
Others came to speak out against speeches Trump has made and the people he has appointed to his cabinet, including Steve Bannon, an editor at Breitbart news, who has made statements promoting white supremacy.
“It’s a very scary time,” said Kenia Gomez, a junior majoring in psychology. “It’s uncomfortable just to stay home and be upset about it, so I’d rather be united and in solidarity with people who feel similar.”
Even those who were not part of a minority community came to stand with those who were fearful, including Constant Williams, a junior majoring in creative writing.
“I just want to show support for all of the marginalized people being affected by this presidency,” Williams said.
After allowing a few minutes for the crowd to gather around Traveler, Mier opened the walkout with a quick speech.
“Let’s make it clear that Trump is not our president,” Mier said, starting a chant of “Not my president,” which turned into “Si se puede,” Spanish for “yes we can.”
For the rest of the time, those in attendance took turns sharing their opinions and fears from the top of the Patsy and Forrest Shumway Fountain. One student was especially worried about Trump’s climate change policy, or lack thereof.
“He’s attempting to put a man in charge of the transition of the EPA who doesn’t believe in climate change,” said Grace Bandeen, a junior majoring in international relations and cinematic arts, critical studies, to a chorus of boos. “Our planet is in such dire condition right now, and the next four years, the next 20 years, the next hundred years are going to make a huge impact.”
For the next hour, students talked about practicing activism in the classroom, getting advice from teachers, demanding that the University appoint a Chief Diversity Officer and explaining their fears about a Trump presidency. By the end of the hour, protesters marched to Bovard Auditorium to submit their petition for the University to become a sanctuary campus.

The No. 1 USC Trojans are set to play in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championship Tournament this weekend at UCLA’s Spieker Aquatics Center.
After an 8-7 upset over the previously No. 1 UCLA Bruins in the season finale, USC will be tested once again against Stanford, Penn State Behrend and — if the Trojans win their first two games — potentially Cal or UCLA.
Junior driver Blake Edwards, who netted the game-winning goal over UCLA in the final frame last Saturday, is excited about a potential rematch with the Bruins at their own pool. 
“UCLA is a fantastic team, and they really set the benchmark for all competition. The physicality of that game just demonstrated how difficult it was to beat them,” Edwards said. “You can never write off UCLA. Coming off the loss, they’re going to be extremely motivated. Playing them at their home pool will be a whole different story.”
Against the MPSF this season, USC holds an untouched 3-0 record with victories over Stanford, Cal and UCLA. 
USC’s lone loss, however, did come against Cal in the Mountain Pacific Invitational, which was deemed a non-conference tournament. 
Since then, the Men of Troy have rattled off 10-straight victories by an average margin of victory of over 11 goals. 
Junior goalie McQuin Baron, the MPSF Player of the Week, has played lights out during that stretch, with a per-game average of 9.75 saves and just 4.42 goals allowed. 
Baron was especially clutch in the Trojans’ win over the Bruins as he capped off a nine-save performance with a save in the final seconds to secure a narrow one-goal victory. 
As much as Baron and the USC defense have shut down opposing offenses, freshman two-meter Matt Maier and the Trojans’ scoring attack have been equally as dominant down the stretch.
“We felt pretty confident coming off our big win against Cal,” Maier said. “We had a feeling that our time is now. We came into [the game against UCLA] with the intention of getting back at them for beating us the past two years.”
Against Stanford, a team that has allowed 6.18 goals this season, the Men of Troy netted eight goals thanks to Maier, Edwards (2), junior driver Grant Stein (2), freshmen drivers Thomas Dunstan and Marin Dasic and junior utility James Walters. 
Coming off of three-straight one-goal losses to top-ranked programs UCLA, Pacific and Cal, the Cardinal are hungry for an upset. Offensively, the Cardinal have averaged 11.1 goals per game as Blake Parrish (40), Mitchell Mendoza (29) and Cody Smith (29) continue to put up big numbers.
Stanford goalie Oliver Lewis has impressed with an average of 10.0 saves and 6.83 goals allowed per game.
As for USC’s second opponent, the Penn State Behrend Lions are still winless after 23 games this season. 
Along with averaging 7.69 goals on offense, the Lions have given up 428 total goals this year (18.6 goals per game). 
Opposing offenses have scored 20 or more goals in seven of the 23 games. 
Penn State Behrend nearly overcame Caltech with four goals apiece from Andre Sardaryzadeh and Isaak Hatopp, but lost the contest due to the Beavers’ offensive surge.
Ultimately, USC’s focus will be on winning the MPSF Championship game in order to advance to its 12th-straight NCAA tournament appearance. 
“We have to treat every game like it’s the biggest game of our careers,” Maier said. “If we go into a game with that 7 and prepare the same way, if we can maintain that attitude, we can beat anyone.”

Anvay Ullal | Daily TrojanMoney Metu · Sophomore forward Chimezie Metu delivered his first double-double of the season on Sunday against Omaha in the win.
To say everything is bigger in Texas is a fitting statement when looking at the men’s basketball team’s upcoming Friday matchup with Texas A&M. The Trojans will take to the road for the first time this season as they travel out to play against the Aggies in College Station, Texas, in a non-conference contest. 
The game will undoubtedly be the biggest test on the young season for both USC and Texas A&M — both teams enter the game at 2-0, coming off of consecutive double-digit victories. USC is coming off of a 82-72 victory over Omaha on Sunday, while the Aggies are coming off of a 76-53 win over American on Monday night.
Friday night’s big game against a solid SEC opponent in Texas A&M will also pit USC against the Aggies’ large frontcourt — which features players averaging 6-foot-10 in height and 231 pounds in weight.
Leading the way for the Aggies’ big men is Tyler Davis, who currently leads Texas A&M in scoring (averaging 16.5 points per game) through two games. At 6-foot-10, 270 pounds, with a diverse offensive skill set, Davis has proven to be a matchup nightmare for opposing defenses. 
“We’ve just got to find ways to deny [Davis] the ball defensively,” said USC sophomore forward Chimezie Metu, who recorded his first double-double (15 points, 11 rebounds) of the season Sunday against Omaha. “When he does catch it, we’ve got to play him straight up and be physical with him.”
Over the course of its first two games against Montana and Omaha, USC needed second-half surges to outlast opponents for the victories. In the season opener against Montana last Friday, USC found itself trailing by 11 points early in the first half before storming back for the 75-61 win. In its victory over Omaha Sunday, USC trailed by three points at the half before outscoring the Mavericks 48-35 in the second half for the win.
“Against a really, really good team you don’t want to get down early, because they might be able to keep you down for the rest of the game,” junior guard Jordan McLaughlin said. “Especially on the road you always have to get off to a good start that way you can keep the crowd down as quiet as possible — we have to get off to a good start.”
The Trojans are coming off of two double digit victories to commence the new season. In these impressive, come-from-behind victories, the youth of the team has been highly involved and has shined on several occasions. 
Freshman guards De’Anthony Melton, Jonah Mathews and forward Nick Rakocevic all saw significant playing time during the first weekend of their collegiate basketball careers. 
Melton averaged 9.5 points, 8.5 rebounds and three assists and totaled a team-high five steals through the first two games. 
“I love playing defense. Defense is what gets me going because it can lead to easy buckets on the other end,” said Melton, who had a game-high three steals against Omaha. “It makes [our opponents] more hesitant on offense, they have to think about making passes more.” 
Texas A&M has also been the beneficiary of strong contributions from freshmen early on, as freshman Aggies forward Robert Williams scored 10 points against American on Monday and has totaled seven blocks through his first two college games. 
Both USC and Texas A&M have had solid showings on the glass early on in the season. USC has, on average, outrebounded opponents by a margin of 8 RPG; the Aggies have outrebounded opposing teams by 9.5 RPG this season. Extra possessions earned on rebounds may play a pivotal role. 
“I’m just trying to fill the void that [former players] who aren’t here anymore left behind rebounding-wise,” said Metu, who is averaging nine rebounds per game. “I think it’s going to be a really fun game … [Texas A&M] is a good team, we’re a good team — it should be a competitive one.”

While USC’s latest ranking at No. 13 in the College Football Playoff is impressive, there are two things that are still quite frustrating about the whole situation. First of all, and most importantly, the Trojans don’t control their own destiny. Second, the CFP rankings are already inconsistent and filled with human bias.
Despite the hand of redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold that has saved their season, the early season losses destroyed any hope that this surging team could be in the conversation for a playoff spot. Of course, in hindsight, we can speculate that had Darnold been named the starter from the beginning of the year, it’s quite possible that USC would be just a one- or two-loss team, but the blame can’t squarely be placed on redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne or head coach Clay Helton.
Since both quarterbacks wear the non-contact jersey in practice, how could Helton have known of Darnold’s exquisite ability to connect with receivers when under pressure while Browne struggled so much in similar situations? Changing quarterbacks undoubtedly saved USC’s season, but no one knew how great the transformation would be. 
As in life though, everything comes with a price. A mistake made at the beginning of the season is still a mistake, and still haunting the Trojans who need a lot of help the next two weeks if they want to make it to the Pac-12 Championship game. 
Granted, probably no one thought we would be having this conversation after week four when the team was strapped with a 1-3 record; but now we are. In college football more so than in other sports, every single game matters because you only play each team once. There will be no chance of redemption against Stanford with a new quarterback or Utah in a game that isn’t Darnold’s debut. These things hurt.
However, the CFP committee has looked upon the Trojans with great favor and it is reflected in their ranking. Thirteen is a lot higher than anyone thought USC could be ranked after week four, but how much does the committee’s own bias contribute to this? Is it possible that a small factor in their decision — whether conscious or unconscious — is based on USC’s reputation and brand as a football team?
If the argument is that USC is a completely different team and has turned their season around from their early woes, then that’s fine. But why is Washington State still ranked so low? The Cougars’ record has undergone just as dramatic a transition as the Trojans, if not more so since they are undefeated in conference play. With two tough games coming up against a ranked Colorado and a ranked Washington, they will have a terrific chance to prove their worth, but shouldn’t they be getting more respect as it is?
USC is the highest ranked team with three losses, and maybe part of that is because the Trojans lost at the beginning of the year, to ranked opponents and away from home. The committee has placed an immense emphasis on strength of schedule, but doesn’t seem to consider quality of win or loss in their calculations.
For example, sure Clemson has a great record, but they don’t have to play as tough a schedule as other teams, and they are barely escaping with wins. Three of their last four games have been decided by a touchdown or less. They beat NC State in overtime by 7, Florida State by 3 and lost to Pitt by 1. This doesn’t make for an impressive resume. 
Of last week’s top four teams, three of them — Michigan, Clemson and Washington — lost last Saturday. Washington was the only one who lost to a ranked opponent, but they dropped the furthest, falling from No. 4 to No. 6 while Michigan and Clemson remained in the top four sitting at No. 3 and No. 4, respectively.
Human bias is there, and that is why the playoff committee consists of people who have the capacity to think instead of computer algorithms. But they aren’t being consistent in their job and are letting their biases affect the rankings.
Surely anyone who has watched a lot of Pac-12 football this season knows that no one would want to face this current USC team, but the Trojans are the fourth-highest Pac-12 team. No, there is never a clear-cut answer, and nothing will ever satisfy everyone, but in an attempt to not only make the playoff as fair as possible,  but also including the best teams in the country at the time, human judgment needs to be put at a higher priority instead of the reputations and egos that are on the line.
The Trojans blew their chance to be included in this conversation. No matter how well they are playing at the end of the year, with three losses they won’t make the playoff. However, with a little help, they could still find their way into a great bowl game, and maybe next year, when they can hit the ground running, they too will be in the conversation for the top four spots in the land.

USC football continued Rivalry Week preparations on Wednesday, taking to Howard Jones Field for the team’s penultimate practice before facing archrivals UCLA on Saturday. After what seemed like a season-killing 1-3 start, the Trojans have proceeded to win six straight games, and they now find themselves at No. 13 in the College Football Playoff rankings. A win over the Bruins would keep their Pac-12 championship — and Rose Bowl — hopes alive.
Veteran Leadership
In the midst of the season’s grueling stretch run, head coach Clay Helton praised the Trojans’’ old guard for setting an example for the squad.
“You can see it on this practice field: how fast they’re playing and how much it means to them to finish what we’ve started,” he said.
One of USC’s oldest leaders is actually a fresh face: redshirt senior Stevie Tu’ikolovatu, who transferred to Troy from Utah this fall. Since his arrival, the 25-year-old has become a sage-like presence on the practice field.
“We’ve grown up because of that guy,” Helton said. “He is, without question, one of the more respected players on this football team, and I think a lot of it has to do with the maturity he has.
“He’s a professional ready to go to the next level, and our guys see that and want to be that.”
Tu’ikolovatu has undoubtedly made a large impact on the program, despite only spending one season at USC, and Helton was excited to see where he would go after this season.
“Yes. No question,” Helton said when asked if he expected to see Tu’ikolovatu in the NFL. “It’s hard to have that size and that athleticism and that quick twitch. He’ll be in some camp someplace with an opportunity.”
Time to Hibernate
In Westwood, UCLA remains in the hunt for bowl eligibility even after losing first-string quarterback Josh Rosen for the season in October. The Bruins snapped a four-game losing streak last weekend against Oregon State, as fifth-year senior Mike Fafaul threw for 281 yards en route to a 38-24 victory over the Beavers.
Fafaul may not be “Chosen” Rosen, but that doesn’t mean the Trojans are underestimating him.
“He can make all the throws that Josh Rosen can make,” redshirt junior safety Chris Hawkins said. “But he has a turnover problem, so we’re going to try to take advantage of it.”
The USC defense has been enjoying themselves in recent weeks, racking up three sacks in back-to-back games, and Helton praised the unit’s work ethic.
“To be an elite football team, there is extra work that needs to be put in,” he said. “Credit to the kids: They come in on their own, sit in their defensive team room and do a great job of studying the opponent.”
Hawkins has been a leader on the defense throughout the season, and he summed it up simply.
“We know that we’re a good team,” he said, “so we have to prepare like a good team.”
Forget the Records
Preparing for a rivalry game, the Trojans were wary of getting too amped up — as they arguably did leading up to the season opener versus Alabama — and the squad has been working hard to maintain an even keel throughout the week.
“When you get on such a roll like we’re on right now, it’s hard not to feel confident,” Hawkins said. “But at the same time, you must be humble. If a loss were to happen and you hit rock bottom, how would you recover from that?”
This is an exciting time of the year, with the Pac-12 South race going down to the wire, but Hawkins insisted the team’s eyes remained squarely on the weekend.
“We’re not looking forward right now: We’re focused on UCLA,” he said. “Hopefully we win and let everything else take care of itself.”
Helton was also quick to remind everyone: There is no point in looking ahead if the Trojans don’t emerge victorious this weekend.
“No matter how it swings Saturday, the fact of the matter is, we’ve got to line up and play a good UCLA team,” he said, “and if we’re not all there, we’ll get our butt beat.”

After a strong 32-point victory in their season opener against Hawaii, the women’s basketball team looked to expand their strong start to the season against UC Riverside on Wednesday night. While the Trojans did defeat the Highlanders 67-49, it was not as easy of a victory as head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke would have liked.
“I wasn’t happy with how we played.” Cooper-Dyke said, “but I’m happy that we won the game. We did what we needed to do in order to come away with the victory.”
The Women of Troy had a rough start to the beginning of the game with only a few of their shots falling in the first quarter. Luckily for the Trojans, the Highlanders were also struggling to find their shot, which allowed USC to obtain a one-point lead at the end of the quarter. 
“When you miss baskets, it’s not fun,” freshmen guard Minyon Moore said. “But when you dwell on the baskets you miss, you will continue to miss baskets, so you have to shake it off and get onto the next play.”
With their defense taking over the game in the second quarter, the Trojans were able to pull ahead with eight fast-break points compared to two for UC Riverside. Both teams continued to miss shots, but the Women of Troy increased the intensity of their defense to create turnovers that they would capitalize on for the rest of the game.
“You have got to come out and play hard from the beginning, even when your shots aren’t necessarily going in,” Cooper-Dyke said. “For us, we like to play defense and let our offense fed off our defense.”
USC’s bench allowed them to pull even further ahead in the second half as it scored 42 of the team’s 67 points. Moore led the charge in her career high game with 20 points, six assists and six steals.
“We have players that are ready to step in and help out with the win and help get us on track both offensively and defensively,” Cooper-Dyke said. “It is great to see our players coming in off the bench and contributing in the way that they did tonight. It is important to have a deep bench, especially for games like this, where you don’t necessarily get off to a good start.” 
Rejane Verin led UC Riverside’s fight to take back the lead with 15 points, but USC never allowed the Highlanders back into the game. The Women of Troy’s defense frazzled UC Riverside’s offense, forcing 29 turnovers. USC scored 41 points off of these turnovers, which heavily contributed to their victory.
“One of the adjustments we made at halftime was defensive intensity,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We really stepped up our defense and started trapping. It really got us started.”
With yet another win under their belt, the Trojans will head to Las Vegas to take on UNLV on Saturday. This tough win not only allowed the team a chance to defend their home court, but also get rest before two long road trips.
“It is important to come away with this win before going out on the road where we will encounter the opponent’s home crowd,” Cooper-Dyke said. “But it also allows us to have a taste of what it feels like to struggle in a game, to not have your shots fall, but to still come away with a victory.”

Last year during Thanksgiving, I sat around the table at my sister’s house in Santa Monica while sporting my “Gobble Veggies Not Turkeys” red PETA sweatshirt. Following this mantra, my vegan brother, Zack, and I delighted in the delicious plant-based dishes I prepared: a cranberry salsa dip, green-bean casserole and pumpkin pie. To my surprise, my non-vegan family loved the dishes so much they had to resist devouring our portions. 
My sister, Thea, intrigued by my newfound animal rights activism, asked me to explain why I decided to become an activist. As a newbie to the animal rights movement, I had recently begun my internship at PETA’s Bob Barker Building; I passionately spat out all the information and reasons that I could possibly think of. 
I fervidly explained how all sentient beings deserve to live their lives free from suffering and exploitation. Animals, just as humans, have the same capacity to feel fear, pain and frustration. Of course, we can’t treat animals the same way as we would treat humans, as we have different interests; animals deserve what humanitarian philosopher Peter Singer coins as “equal consideration.” If you wouldn’t eat a child, you shouldn’t eat a cow and if you wouldn’t eat a dog you shouldn’t eat a turkey. This ideology is based in non-speciesist morals — that is, the interests of our species shouldn’t override the interests of others and we also shouldn’t prejudice between different species of animals.
Thea stared at me and then at Zack, who proceeded to explain his reasons to go vegan, mainly environmental. Observant of Thea’s icy body movement, I thought about how inherently controversial veganism is and how vital it is to remain reasonable while impassioned to gain the opposer’s respect and maintain credibility.As Thea criticized our claims, I figured she perceived Zack and I as unreasonable extremists, as contrarians neglecting to adhere to the status quo. Although slightly agitated, family gatherings usually incite malaise anyways, and I was enjoying the discussion of ethics with the support of my well-versed vegan sibling.
I continued to stand my ground, reminding myself that Thea and the rest of my family enjoyed the dishes I prepared — a testimony that vegan food is delicious, and of course, healthier and spares the lives of animals. 
When Thea began to prod me about my sweatshirt, I explained the horrors that turkeys face every year. So much for the “preachy” profiling of vegans. This time, among many others, my talk of veganism was spurred by someone’s genuine curiosity.
According to Farm Sanctuary, an estimated 46 million turkeys are killed every year for Thanksgiving alone. These turkeys are raised in overcrowded, dark, and fetid sheds and routinely have their beaks cut off absent of painkillers so they can’t peck each other to death. The stress incited by these inhumane conditions is the culprit of death for some turkeys. At only 5 or 6 months old, with their legs breaking under the pressure of the weight of their genetically bred bodies, the turkeys are thrown into crates and taken to the slaughterhouses. 
So, this Thanksgiving, I ask you to promote compassionate dinner plates. Bring plant-based dishes, sport animal rights attire and engage your families in turkey conversation — and no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump. Though it is easy to shy away from engaging with ideological differences, the only way to incite change is to speak up for the voiceless who so desperately need our help.

Thank you, Tessa! I agree with you: Giving “thanks” by eating an abused, slaughtered bird who had a family of her own is no way to honor the essence of the holiday.
Thanks so much for sharing your story! I’ve been vegan for 24 years and my immediate family celebrates a vegan Thanksgiving with me. But it wasn’t always this way. It takes a while sometimes–keep up the great work spreading compassion!
Thanks for being an advocate for turkeys and other animals, Tessa! I’m sure your compassion is having a positive impact on your family, even if they aren’t fully “there” yet. It’s amazing how kindness is contagious! :)
Nice piece, thank you.  I always leave family dinners with a bloody tongue from biting it.  I have kind, generous, informed family members who know the horrors of factory farming and yet they still eat dead turkey parts and other animals.  I cannot wrap my head around it.  I appreciate your efforts to “get through” to your family.

What was originally a textbook in the Harry Potter universe, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has become its own film in the Harry Potter cinematic universe. Fantastic Beasts, which was originally mentioned as a textbook commonly read by the students of Hogwarts, became an actual published book in the “Muggle world” shortly after the release of the series’ fourth installation.
Author J.K. Rowling has now set her sights on expanding the Harry Potter universe through Fantastic Beasts, the first of five standalone films to be released in the future. David Yates, who previously directed the last four Harry Potter films, made his return to the universe with this installation. 
In the past, J.K. Rowling has overlooked the production of the film and the writing, but has now moved on to be the sole screenwriter for the film. The dynamic relationship between Yates and Rowling has also created one of the darkest films in the franchise yet. With new characters and conflicts, Rowling and Yates shifted from the more family-oriented PG Potter films to a serious, gray-toned, PG-13 movie. 
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them uses brand-new characters in a 1920s gothic version of New York City, the first Harry Potter film to take place outside of the U.K. Though it is a standalone movie set about 70 years before Harry Potter was born, the movie still pays homage through several references within the script. 
The film began with protagonist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a zoologist for beasts and his journey through New York. Scamander bumps into Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), an everyday factory worker who aspires to be a baker. Scamander’s beasts eventually lead them to work together in order to find the beasts that fled them. Along the way, the two find Tina Goldenstein (Katherine Waterson), a wizard that specializes in detaining evil beings, and her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) who has the ability to read minds. These four then adventure throughout 1920s New York in order to recapture all of the beasts as a deal with the the magic ministry of the United States, whose main purpose is for the No-Maj, or humans without magic, to not know the existence of Wizards. Through this arc, Credence (Ezra Miller) were then brought in with Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) acting as detective-like characters throughout the film. 
Fantastic Beasts finds its strength with its veteran cast and unique story within a different time period. Redmayne was a fantastic, naive, beast fanatic complemented by Dan Fogler, whose charm made the audience fall in love with him instantly. Redmayne used his emotions and and body movements to fully portray his story.
One thing that sets Fantastic Beasts apart from the other Harry Potter movies is that there was no need for a comic relief, as every cast member had their moment to shine. Fogler, however, stole the show with the way he portrayed Jacob Kowalski’s obliviousness to the wizarding world, all while being caught in a romance. Farrell and Miller paired together perfectly, though Farrell dominated most of the scenes in which he appeared. Miller had few words in the film, but used his emotions and actions to portray his character well. His more serious role was a crucial asset to advancing the storyline.
J.K Rowling’s screenwriting made for great chemistry between the actors on the screen. Not only was the acting spectacular, but the set design was also visually stunning. Every scene in the film felt realistic, as if it were actually New York in the ’20s. The architecture, costume design and technology  created a true escapism into the Potter universe. One of Fantastic Beasts’ only weaknesses was the little background story that each character had prior to their appearance in the film, which made it a bit difficult for viewers to be fully engaged.
The intensive use of CGI effects used throughout the film truly showcased the film’s $180 million budget. From the beasts to characters to the magic, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them truly showed the power of CGI effects as a main trademark of Harry Potter movies.
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them pays homage to those who want to explore more of the iconic wizarding world that J.K. Rowling created, while introducing brand new characters to the franchise. Rowling’s fantasy lore will continue to expand throughout the next five films including characters referenced in the book, such as Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) and yet to be announced, Dumbledore.

The annual Conquest event will be held Thursday night on McCarthy Quad to commemorate this Saturday’s football game against crosstown rival UCLA. The University Student Government Program Board, alongside Campus Activities, Concerts Committee and Trojan Pride, will kick off the event at 5 p.m. with food trucks, photo booths and a Ferris wheel.
This year’s student hosts Chris Wodniak and Omete Anassi will lead the rally at 7 p.m. The Trojan Marching Band, Song Girls, football team and other student organizations will take the stage to hype students up by recreating game day vibes with performances and spirit chants.
Attendees will witness the popular Bruin bonfire and fireworks show organized by Trojan Pride to officially heat up the CONQUEST! celebration. As students will engulf the wooden bear in flames as tradition, the football team hopes to snuff out their opponent and gain an 8-3 lead in the PAC-12 Conference.
“We are expecting a large turnout as UCLA is such a large rival and USC football is looking pretty good right about now,” said Kira Stiers, director of media for Concerts Committee. “It’s also just about the study break opportunity. People can come visit the food trucks, ride the Ferris wheel and hear some good music.”
Following the rally and bonfire, Concerts Committee will have musical guests AlunaGeorge and Majid Jordan perform starting at 8:30 p.m.
Lead singer Aluna Francis and instrumentalist George Reid form the British electronic duo AlunaGeorge, who became popular in 2012 with their breakout single “You Know You Like It.” In 2015, the DJ Snake remix of their song landed the No. 13 spot on the Billboard Hot 100. Their second album will be released in the spring, featuring EDM topliners Flume and Zhu.
The next duo from Toronto, Majid Jordan, rose to fame with the help of fellow Canadian Drake and his song “Hold On, We’re Going Home,” which soared to the Billboard Top Five in 2013. Majid Al Maskati and Jordan Ullman later signed with OVO Music and have since released an EP in 2014 and a self-titled album last February that climbed to No. 20 in Canada and No. 69 in the U.S.
“I think Majid Jordan will bring people out because they’re an R&B duo from Canada signed to OVO and people respect that label,” Stiers said. “AlunaGeorge has a unique sound and have played Lollapalooza to Hard Summer so the name will probably attract a lot of people.” 
USC students are admitted for free with their school IDs and can bring guests with government -issued IDs.

USC students have recently and proudly participated in protests against abuses that they fear will result under the incoming Trump administration. Student groups on campus have become more active in order to provide solidarity and solace for their members and to encourage their fellow millennials to continue to fight for their beliefs using political pressure and the democratic process. Our generation is preparing to faithfully defend human dignity here at home. Yet, with all of the fanfare during the 19-month election cycle, we have forgotten the places where even basic human rights are nothing but a memory.
This week, The New York Times reported that Saudi Arabia has also been participating in something important for 19 months: a campaign against Shi’ite Muslim rebels in Yemen. The military intervention by Saudi Arabia and its allies has failed to oust the rebels, however, and has resulted in shocking damage to Yemen’s struggling economy and populace. Compounding matters, Saudi and allied fighter-bomber pilots have operated with reckless abandon, bombing food manufacturers, hospitals and schools. Even weddings and a funeral have been hit by bombs dropped from Saudi planes. Major cities are pockmarked with craters and the civilians beg in the street for sustenance. The United Nations has cried foul at what appears to be the Saudi coalition’s indiscriminate bombing of civilian infrastructure and its interference in providing aid.
Not even a leading international disaster relief agency, the Iranian Red Crescent Society, was safe from needlessly abhorrent endangerment. Early in the conflict, Saudi planes bombed the entire Yemeni capital’s airport to prevent a single aid plane from the IRCS from landing, destroying the runways, the control tower and a civilian airliner in the process. Most shameful of all, the Saudi coalition is estimated to be responsible for twice as many casualties as the rebels they are fighting. Clearly, this is a humanitarian crisis, and the United States government needs to act.
Except it already has. It sold Saudi Arabia and its allies the F-15 and F-16 fighter-bombers that they are using. It taught the Saudi Arabian pilots how to use those planes and provided bombs that were dropped on civilian targets, violating international law. It even offered to refuel Saudi planes in mid-air. And the United States continues to sell arms to the Saudi military, all the while claiming that the airstrikes it is enabling are needlessly escalating the conflict.
The United States did this in order to not upset the delicate balance of Middle Eastern powers in the Arabian Peninsula, especially after warming relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia’s religious and political nemesis. Despite hundreds of factories being destroyed and about 10,000 Yemeni deaths, the United States has shown no willingness to sensibly delay fulfilling arms deals with the Saudis until the conflict concludes. What the United States has shown through its example is that convenient geopolitical considerations are more important than the lives, livelihoods and rights of thousands of innocents. Bear in mind that this has been allowed under the auspices of a Democratic administration.
Enabling such a horrific tragedy to continue to play out is certainly worthy of protest. Yet, no student group has publicly spoken out in recent months against the United States’ role in perpetuating the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. No arguments have been made in lieu of regularly-scheduled class discussions like what has been occurring because of the election. The Daily Trojan published a pair of articles on the conflict when it began, and that appears to have been both the beginning and the end of the discussion on campus until today. Compare that to student fear of and discussion about Trump’s xenophobic policy recommendations while the conflict in Yemen has raged on and you see the problem. When we fear that our rights may be violated, we mobilize. When it happens abroad, we seem to sip our tea and shake our collective heads, if anything at all.
If human rights and dignity are truly human, students need to address where our government violates them -— not only at home, but abroad, too.

President-elect Donald Trump is no stranger to having his old tweets dug up. During the presidential debates, many Twitter users began retweeting statements Trump had made throughout the years that contradicted what he was saying on stage — like the now infamous tweet about China inventing climate change. This week another one of Trump’s tweets from years ago went viral. Almost exactly four years ago, Trump tweeted, “The electoral college is a disaster for America.”
Matt Pearce, national reporter for the Los Angeles Times, posted a screenshot of that tweet next to one of Trump’s tweets from the last week: “The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!” Although votes are still being counted, the Associated Press currently has Clinton winning the popular vote by almost 1.16 million votes, according to the Cook Political Report. Trump has always been the candidate of self-interest not principles; so, this deep hypocrisy is not surprising. But an important lesson can be taken from Trump’s Electoral College flip flop: In this time of great uncertainty and insecurity, we must be following important, deeply held principles instead of being bogged down in partisan politics, advocating solely for what helps the party or candidates we support. 
When the Electoral College has caused two out of the last five elections to go to the candidate with significantly less votes, people have a right to be outraged, to question the justifications for our election process. But those of us who hold up signs that read “Abolish the Electoral College” should ask ourselves, would we still be protesting this system if Clinton has won enough delegates, but lost the popular vote? The Electoral College should be abolished because it is deeply undemocratic, not because it didn’t result in the President I wanted.
Similarly, while the anti-Trump protests on this campus and in cities across the country have brought up important issues surrounding immigration, Islamophobia, sexual harassment and police brutality, we must not allow these to become contextualized as only a problem in Trump’s America. The buzzword this week in news outlets, blogs and social media was normalization. The argument goes that Trump and his supporters have mainstreamed, or made more acceptable, bigotry, white nationalism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc. And to a certain extent that is true. Social media sites have been extremely useful platforms for people across the country to share their experiences with racism, homophobia and other forms of discrimination, immediately post-election. And according to the FBI, in the last year, U.S. hate crimes, many against Muslims, have surged 6 percent. Trump’s rhetoric is undoubtedly toxic and must be disavowed. 
However, we must ask ourselves where were we when President Obama was deporting record numbers of undocumented immigrants. Where were we when Obama fully embraced drone strikes. It is important to be vocal in the face of a Trump presidency, but we must also remember that what we are protesting goes well beyond Trump. Professor Crystal Fleming, assistant professor of sociology and Africana studies at Stony Brook University, tweeted this Wednesday, “There are a lot of people condemning Trump’s white nationalism who never condemned the white nationalism of the ‘founding fathers.’” 
In order to truly comprehend and struggle against a White House administration that welcomes anti-Semites, misogynists, racists and homophobes, it is imperative that the U.S. grapple with its history. Despite Washington Post articles that claim “Trump’s campaign made it safe to hate again,” we must remember that, in America, it has always been safe to hate. The United States is a country founded on white supremacy and patriarchy. The United States is a country that put Japanese Americans in camps fewer than 80 years ago, The United States is a country where almost 1,200 people, mostly people of color, were killed by police in 2015. The U.S. is a country where it is legal to fire someone based on sexual orientation or gender identity in 28 states. 
The anti-Trump protests must be about far more than saying “f-ck Donald Trump.” And they must be about more than finding fault with the GOP.  Rather, we must recognize discrimination in all of its forms, on the right and on the left — discrimination that in certain ways has been normalized by Trump, and in other ways has always been normal. We must remember that the things we are protesting now, would have had to have been protested under any administration. Police brutality, unjust immigration laws, transphobia and ableism are not exclusive to one party. The struggle to make America more equal, more just and more inclusive cannot start and end with Trump.

I always thought writing was what I would pursue after graduating college. Or maybe I would go into publishing — if I couldn’t be a published writer, I would publish writers. I worked on my high school newspaper for two years as an editor and a writer and later on as Editor-in-Chief for some time. In my own time, I wrote short stories, poems, and articles for my blog. It seemed natural that I should seek out a job that honed in on these skills.  
My first experience as an intern was for a publishing company in Los Angeles. As an editorial intern, my responsibilities included proofreading, fact checking, and preparing manuscripts for publication. I worked directly with the lead editors and publicity directors in making sure the formatting, style, and content of the writing was ready to be sent out to printing companies and sold to various independent bookstores. During my time as an intern, I saw several books I had worked on go through the publishing process from start to finish, all the way from the typos to the bookshelves. A few months after I had left the company, I remember walking into Skylight Books in Los Feliz and seeing a book I had reviewed sitting on the bookshelf, waiting to be purchased and read. At that moment I realized the work I had done carried meaning and it wasn’t just another unpaid internship I could slap on my resume to impress employers. I had contributed to a writer’s work, however small of a contribution it may have been. 
While I enjoyed my experience as an editorial intern, I knew that publishing wasn’t my calling. I wanted something more exciting, more challenging. I needed a job that would present me with a new problem every day. I also wanted to be on the other end of the publishing process; I wanted to be the writer. 
Now in my junior year of college, I still don’t have a clear sense of what I will be doing in two years. I don’t regret my internship — it was more of a positive learning experience as it helped me decide what I don’t want to pursue in my work life. Not all internships will follow a linear path to the life you’ve been planning and preparing for. It may take one job to make you realize what you don’t want, bringing you one step closer to what you do want.

On a warm day in early April, a group of USC students stood in the center of campus chanting and protesting the most recent hike in tuition fees.
“Nikias, step off it, put students over profit,” they shouted into a megaphone just a few feet from Bovard Auditorium, where President C. L. Max Nikias’ office is located. 
The 11 students convened were speaking out against the most recent $3,000 tuition hike for the 2016-2017 school year, putting USC’s price tag ahead of other universities like Stanford University and Harvard University as one of the most expensive colleges in the country. 
The cost of USC can quickly become prohibitive for lower-income students even if they take on a job, an issue that the University has been attempting to address for centuries. As far back as the 1960s, the students and faculty of USC were exploring ways to broaden perspectives and open up the Trojan Family to people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. 
USC’s tuition increase follows a growing national trend. Tuition costs for private universities have been outpacing inflation since before the turn of the millennium, and the average cost of attendance at a private four-year university is now $38,762 compared to $18,573 in 2000, according to U.S. News. Given the rising cost of attending college, the University tries to help students plan for the future.
“From the financial aid perspective, we’re consistent in our message that the University does increase tuition every year and that the average tuition increases so that people can plan for it,” said Dean of Financial Aid Thomas McWhorter.
For many students, this warning is not enough, and they would like more specific information about where the extra money is going. The University’s full financial statement is available online with details about assets, investments and the operating budget of the institution. However, it is a difficult document to digest for the average viewer and doesn’t include an easy way to visualize changes in the budget over time as tuition costs increase. 
Between the rising cost of tuition, fees, housing, books, transportation and other expenses, the current estimated price tag of the USC experience is around $69,711 per year. The Undergraduate Student Government is looking to change this and has been working with the administration to find a way to communicate these changes to students.
In response to tension and protests regarding the homogeneity of the undergraduate and graduate student body, the University passed a student-initiated referendum in 1970 called the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund to provide scholarships for qualified low-income students. The program required all students to contribute a modest $4 fee to the fund each semester, a small price to pay for a program that would bring new perspectives onto campus, particularly from the neighborhoods surrounding USC.
In 1993, the Los Angeles Times wrote an article about the students who had benefited from the NTSAF. One student said, “this diversity is what America is going to look like in the future.” Fast forward to today, and the NTSAF still raises funds for scholarships — now with an $8 instead of $4 fee — but the University has developed many other opportunities to make the Trojan experience available to people of all backgrounds. 
While answering questions of how tuition is being used, Nikias is also working to raise money so that students don’t have to pay as much.
In 2011, Nikias launched a $6 billion fundraising campaign with the vision of strengthening USC’s impact on the community and the world. Part of this vision involves providing more opportunities for students, as a significant portion of these funds will go directly into the endowment for student scholarships. According to McWhorter, the increase in funds could open up new opportunities for students with need.
“With more money at our disposal, we could be more generous in how we analyze need,” McWhorter said. “We could provide less financial aid package in loan, and also provide more merit scholarship opportunities.”
Additionally, though USC stands out as one of the most expensive schools in the country, it also stands out as one of a limited number of schools in the country to offer need-blind admission, meaning the school does not consider financial circumstances while evaluating applicants. The financial aid system also meets full demonstrated need, theoretically making the USC experience available to people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. The question though, for students such as those protesting outside Bovard Auditorium, becomes whether low-income students have access to the same USC experience.
An important part of the USC experience involves student organizations. There are hundreds of student organizations on campus and many of them require dues that range anywhere from $80 to $3,000, which can be a formidable barrier for low-income students. USG President Edwin Saucedo understands the struggle for low-income students joining organizations with expensive dues.
“I am a low-income student and so I am at USC on a full ride,“ Saucedo said. “However, that full ride applies to my studies, applies to my housing, applies to some expenses, but it doesn’t support being able to get involved with these types of organizations. So having to pay $2,000 in dues every semester would have to come from my pocket, and some people just can’t afford to do that.”
Even students from a financially secure background face barriers to joining these student organizations. Jeff Fischer, a senior majoring in psychology, does not receive financial support from his parents beyond the estimated cost of attendance. As a result, he works at local restaurant Study Hall to pay his fraternity dues, housing and social expenses. He said the balancing act of working and completing school work has been difficult but rewarding.
“It’s a burden, and it’s a lesson,” Fischer said. “I have to work to maintain the social life that I want at USC, but then I don’t take it for granted because of the fact that I do earn it.”
However, students are also worried about where their money is going, regardless of how much of their tuition they are paying. USG has also been fighting for tuition transparency to alleviate students’ concerns about the steadily rising price of their education. 
“It helps students understand that if they’re getting an increase in tuition, where is that additional money going to?” Saucedo said. “Is it going to the professors or simply into the pockets of the administrators? And I don’t think it’s the latter, but I think a lot of students are skeptical that it is. So that’s really what we’re trying to prove.”
Tuition costs will continue climbing and students will continue to struggle with how to finance college. But the administration and USG have both set forth a goal — to keep money from being a prohibitive factor to anyone who hopes to someday become a Trojan.

Following last Tuesday’s election results, hundreds of USC students and faculty members, along with local middle school and high school students, marched on Trousdale Parkway to protest President-elect Donald Trump. Protesters gathered in peaceful protest next to Tommy Trojan, holding signs emblazoned with slogans reading “Not my President.” 
Over the week, thousands of protesters congregated in the streets to rally against Trump, shutting down traffic and making it clear that the President-elect is not their president. The city became a soapbox for the frustrations of liberal and some conservative Americans in response to the recent elections, leaving conservatives at USC feeling stranded and exiled. 
According to exit poll data from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, approximately 55 percent of college-age voters chose Clinton, whereas Trump received only 37 percent of their votes. 
Like many colleges, USC is a primarily liberal environment, according to an assessment of administrative policies, campus groups and faculty members by Campus Reform. With the country so divided, many conservatives feel that the USC campus cultivates an environment where it is difficult to openly support a conservative candidate.
“I had a [Trump] flag in my room,” said Connor Fugman, a junior majoring in business administration. “Somebody actually came into my room, stole the flag, spray painted it and put it in a toilet stall.” 
Fugman still doesn’t know who did it, making him worry that it could’ve been one of his friends. 
Mike Feehan, a junior majoring in business administration, had a similar experience. He was wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap at a fraternity party, when people started grabbing it from his head and yelling “F-ck Trump.”
Feehan retrieved his hat and put it back on, but when he turned around, someone else took it off his head again.
He found his hat the next day stepped on and ruined.
It was a small incident in the course of a tumultuous election cycle, but for Feehan, it made him realize his opinions weren’t welcome at USC. 
With party politics dividing the nation, the sentiment crossing partisan lines is a deep fear of the opposing side.
According to a Pew Research Center poll, 86 percent of Democrats view Republicans unfavorably and 41 percent see Republicans as a threat to this nation. The same poll also stated that 91 percent of Republicans view Democrats unfavorably and 45 percent see Democrats as a threat to the nation. 
This tension captures the sentiments of a frustrated America where many are realizing that their neighbor might not see eye-to-eye with their own beliefs.
With opinions falling outside the popular range of the political spectrum on campus, in addition to being in a liberal environment, some students find it challenging to express themselves for fear of being attacked by their peers. This has caused many students to refrain from sharing their thoughts, especially on the Election Night viewing at Wallis Annenberg Hall.
“I realized on the day of the election that my friend is a Trump supporter,” said Angela Ho, a junior majoring in fine arts, who attended the Annenberg viewing. “I didn’t want him to cheer in the midst of everyone’s mourning because I knew it would create a strong, negative response. My friend and I were not only afraid of his safety, but ours because we were associated with him.”
In the days after the election, classroom political discussions also felt like an unwelcome environment for students with differing political beliefs. 
“As someone who voted for Trump. I get extremely uncomfortable,” said Jacob Ellenhorn, a USC law student and former president of College Republicans. “The professors make it seem as though his election is a calamity of epic proportions, but I think having a Republican in the White House is good.”
Liberals on campus have also noticed the discord, but some said that they hope to work with conservatives on campus to create more discourse.
“In this election we certainly learned that we don’t do a good enough job of positively engaging with those with whom we disagree,” said Nick Fiorillo, political director of USC College Democrats. “While as liberals, we need to continue to call out bigotry, prejudice and oppression, we would be well-served to think about how to do this in ways that change minds.”
Outside of campus,  Trump supporters also feel attacked online. It is difficult for Feehan to feel accepted in a political environment, even on the internet.
“The sad truth is there’s too many times where I have had people who have unfriended me off of Facebook just because I said I support Trump,” Feehan said. 
However, Feehan is not afraid to express his opinions and support for a Trump presidency.
“I guess some of my friends might feel that way,” Feehan said. “But, I know what I believe in and could [not] care less if others don’t want to be my friends or want to challenge me.”
Despite Trump’s comments on sexual assault, immigration and race — which received criticism from many millennials — there is still a large number of college-aged students who strongly advocate for him.
“I am tired of the political establishment. I do not want a politician in office anymore, I want to build a wall to protect our nation,” Feehan said. “I value the economy, and I feel Trump has proven business experience to make it great again, and I want taxes to be lowered which they will be under his presidency.”
Political tensions are high in Los Angeles, a city with largely Democratic leanings, and the separation between a variety of stances has not been reconciled after the outcome of the election. But conservatives on campus are hopeful that as time goes on, their fellow students will begin to be more understanding and accepting of their viewpoints.
“The Democrats and Republicans are too far apart on important issues, but hopefully that will change,” Feehan said. “Time heals tension. Time will heal everything.”

Ana Mercado was in fifth grade when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents came knocking on her door. They were looking for the owners of the house she was living in at the time with her parents and siblings, not for Mercado herself. But when she looked at her mom, Mercado saw she had turned pale. She watched her mom hold up a finger to her lips as the agents shouted for them to open up, and stayed quiet until they eventually gave up and went away.
“I could see the fear within her,” Mercado said. “She was afraid not just for herself but for her children.”
Students and faculty members gather for a meeting of the USC IDEAS Movement, which stands for “Improving Dreams, Education, Access and Success.” During the meeting, students discussed fearful questions of how to protect themselves and their families from the threat of deportation.— Photo by Trevor Sochocki
Mercado didn’t understand at the time that her mom reacted this way because she, her older brother and both of her parents were undocumented. She came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 3 years old, and had lived in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles for her entire life, so she never felt like her American identity was in question. But for Mercado, now a sophomore majoring in contemporary Latino studies and sociology, the memory of this incident stayed with her as she grew up, applied to college and witnessed the topic of immigration play a larger role in American political discourse. 
As an undocumented student, Mercado is not alone on campus. The USC Financial Aid Office works with as many as 46 undocumented students, and there could be any number of others who do not voluntarily reveal their status or do not seek aid from the University. However, they are a group that largely lacks resources despite facing unique challenges, from college affordability to the threat of deportation. And with rising anti-immigrant sentiment and open threats of mass deportations from President-elect Donald Trump, many are beginning to fear that the lives they have worked hard to build may be in jeopardy. 
Facing barriers
The reasons a student may be classified as undocumented are diverse, as are the demographics of the people that fall into this category. They came to the United States from countries as far apart as Mexico, Brazil and Cambodia, for reasons ranging from fleeing gang violence to seeking better economic opportunities. Some of them tried to apply for citizenship, but found that the process could take years to complete. Others were brought here as children, and didn’t learn about their undocumented status until they had already lived in the U.S. for most of their lives. 
Most undocumented students, however, share a narrative of hardship that encompasses the struggles of all immigrants — adjusting to a new culture, learning the language and missing home — while also facing unique difficulties from a lack of legal documentation. Without a Social Security Number, those who are undocumented cannot legally work, obtain a driver’s license or apply for a loan. 
This also makes applying to college more difficult. Felipe, a graduate engineering student who declined to use his last name in order to protect his status, immigrated from Brazil when he was 15. He said that when applying to USC, he had questions unique to his situation. Should he apply as an international student? How would he get around having to provide a Social Security Number? None of these had easily accessible answers. 
“Navigating school is already hard. You come in as a freshman and you don’t know what to do. There’s all these documents you have to fill out,” Felipe said. “Coming as an undocumented [student] is way harder because you cannot just go get the information. You have to meet people and find [your own] way around.” 
Paying for USC is difficult as well, mainly because undocumented students are not eligible for federal financial aid such as Pell Grants or student loans. The California DREAM Act provides some relief, allowing certain students to apply for in-state public and private assistance, which includes University grants. However, this aid is limited. Though USC promises to meet the full demonstrated need of students eligible for federal funding, this category doesn’t apply to undocumented students, leaving some struggling to fill the gap. 
“Financial aid at USC is a partnership between the student, the parent, the University and the federal and state government,” said Thomas McWhorter, the dean of financial aid at USC. “In the case of an undocumented student, they’ve never been able to access federal student aid … which is why we are asking other departments and scholarship providers if we can help these students. Clearly we’re making it possible because there are a number of students who are here.” 
These other methods can include merit funding, special University programs like the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, scholarships from outside agencies and “self-help” options, including student jobs. Students who qualify under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals act, which applies to undocumented residents who were brought to the United States at a young age after 2007, can receive a temporary Social Security Number, which allows them to work, obtain a driver’s license and apply for loans. 
Many undocumented students work several jobs at a time in order to make up the difference that state or University aid doesn’t cover. But others are forced to take a leave of absence because they cannot afford to pay, according to one undocumented student who preferred to remain anonymous. 
Reaching for resources
In order to address these challenges, numerous organizations at USC have made a special effort to reach out to undocumented students. While many of the cultural centers on campus are prepared to address these students’ questions, El Centro Chicano is particularly active in this area because of the large number of undocumented students that come from Latin American countries. The center, according to El Centro Director Billy Vela, provides emotional support as well as more concrete resources and connections. 
“What they can get is a welcome to the Trojan Family, and love and support and excitement … in effect, some normalcy,” Vela said. “After that, we can go somewhat deeper and find out their particular story.” 
Students can also find that feeling of community through the USC IDEAS Movement, which stands for “Improving Dreams, Education, Access, and Success.” Mercado currently serves as president of this organization, which holds weekly meetings on topics specific to undocumented students. And since last year, they can even find a collection of online resources on the Undergraduate Student Government website, thanks to the efforts of Sen. Sabrina Enriquez. 
But what many students lack, according to USC Rossier professor Kristan Venegas, is a set of formal resources offered by the University, including specialized financial aid options. Venegas has been helping undocumented students at USC informally for the past decade, passing along information through word of mouth and helping connect students to scholarships or mentors. But she said many students can still slip through the cracks because the University does not provide outreach programs or otherwise acknowledge the existence of its undocumented population. 
“If you’re smart enough to get into USC, you clearly have the academic potential to make it just as much as any other student next to you,” Venegas said. “To me, what differentiates you is your ability to access aid and other daily needs. If you’re having to work … you might have to slow down your pace.”
‘Uncertainty and fear’
The need for increased resources has become all the more urgent, Venegas said, in the face of increasingly anti-immigrant rhetoric employed by many individuals and Republican politicians. Most notably, President-elect Donald Trump has called for the mass deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. as a central part of his platform. 
Students have been affected by these statements as well. Mercado said she is concerned by the number of people that openly support Trump on campus. As a result, she has been afraid to talk about her status in public. Others, like Kimberly Alvarado, a sophomore majoring in psychology, have felt the impact of Trump’s call for a special “deportation force” to round up undocumented immigrants on a personal level. Alvarado, who came to the United States from El Salvador when she was 4 years old, said that she fears what will happen to her family and her future if Trump follows through with his promise.
“I’ve worked really hard to get where I am, putting all stereotypes and expectations aside,” Alvarado said. “And right now, I feel like I’m not a part of this country though I call it home, [because] all of that can be taken away so soon. My two younger sisters look up to me, and what if I’m not here for them? What if all this work here was for nothing?”
Vela, however, is hopeful that the rhetoric employed by Trump and his supporters can serve to unite, rather than divide, the student body at USC. 
“The election season has brought up a lot of prominence about the discussion,” Vela said. “I think the response to it has been very fierce and very strong and I feel like has really galvanized people who are both undocumented and allies to push even harder for people to take another look at the community.”
Moving forward
More resources have become available to undocumented students at USC over the past few years. IDEAS was founded in 2011, and USG’s Undocumented Resource Guide was created last year. But students such as Mercado believe that more work needs to be done, starting with formal recognition by the University. 
“I feel like there’s a lot [USC administrators] can do, especially now,” Mercado said. “They speak about ‘diversity’ and providing assistance to all these different cultures, and yet they haven’t done much [for undocumented students]. For one, they need to provide legal assistance — we need to have someone here on campus that we can go to to ask our questions, explain our concerns and get some sort of guidance.” 
Others, such as Enriquez, have fought to create an Undocumented Resource Center, a model that already exists in the University of California system. Plans to implement such a center were included in the Campus Climate Resolution that USG passed in 2015, but the University has yet to act on them. Administrators also have not yet agreed to declare USC a sanctuary for undocumented students, despite an online petition that has garnered over 4,700 signatures from students, faculty and alumni as of Tuesday. And until they do, Mercado said that the responsibility falls on undocumented students to defend the lives they have built in the U.S. in the face of legal and financial threats.
“I feel like the biggest thing is learning,” Mercado said. “Learning about the laws, ways to protect ourselves, gaining that knowledge of everything we need to ensure that we are ready to fight if we have to, that we’re prepared to defend ourselves against whatever comes.”

The Row is filled on a Monday night with girls in dresses and boys in dark suits headed to weekly chapter meetings. These two residential blocks on 28th Street are known for many things — blockbuster parties, all-you-can-eat fundraisers.
But the Row and the students who inhabit it are often criticized for a more prevalent issue — a lack of diversity.
It’s a standard stereotype. The Row is mainly white, wealthy and straight, representing an exclusive caste of society. But in the wake of nationwide criticism of Greek life — and on a campus known for its diversity — the Row is striving to create an accepting environment for all students.
According to Director of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development Jenell Lanski, the Trojan Greek Community Standards define how the Greek Office should match the needs and goals of the USC community.
“Diversity, inclusion and cultural competency are the standard of fraternity and sorority membership,” Lanski said in an email statement.
The Standards, however, are 14 pages long and mention diversity only twice. And despite setting out a goal for leaders to “develop and broaden their knowledge of diversity,” the document is vague about how this goal can be implemented.
That ambiguity leaves a lot up in the air for Greek leaders. Julian Mowatt, an executive board member for Beta Theta Pi, believes the nature of the Greek system creates an exclusive environment that is hard to escape.
Mowatt is a gay, black fraternity man, an outlier on the Row. Beta has been an accepting and loving home for him. But his home on the Row is also where he has heard the most homophobic and racist language in his time at USC. He believes this is because the members of Greek life are sheltered in a homogenous community.
“It’s so easy to get sucked in and never really interact with anyone who’s all that different from you,” Mowatt said. “It makes sense, those are your people, you know, your best friends. But if you don’t interact with anyone outside that environment, then you’re not really getting the full experience of understanding other people.”
The houses themselves are segregated into “tiers,” which are formally ignored but widely accepted across campus. Typically, fraternities only mix with a few sororities in their tier, and vice versa, which Mowatt believes creates a sheltered environment. This system of self-segregation starts as early as recruitment.
“I wouldn’t say that it’s a racist system, but it’s definitely a prejudiced system,” Mowatt said. “And we start that prejudice from the very first week in rush. It’s such a quick week, and you don’t really get to know anyone deeply during that week, but that’s what the rest of your time [in Greek life] is based on.”
Throughout the country, sorority recruitment in particular draws ire, resulting in hundreds of articles criticizing the glitter-infused, kiss-blowing superficiality of the week-long selection process. Videos and pictures from the process often create a wealthy, whitewashed picture of sororities.
It’s an image that the Panhellenic Council is attempting to erase from Greek culture at USC.
“The University of Southern California Panhellenic Council’s mission is to create a unified, multi-faceted Greek community by empowering women to discover their fullest potential,” Panhellenic Council president Alaina Hartley said in an email statement. “One of our priorities is developing a more diverse community.”
This year, the Council implemented a “Values Based” recruitment plan to attempt to create a more accepting experience for potential new members. The plan banned smaller details of the process — such as hair flips during chants and catered food on certain days — and required potential new members to wear T-shirts for the first two days.
In the week before recruitment, Panhellenic released a “Panhellenic Perspectives” series highlighting women from each chapter who come from diverse backgrounds. And each chapter participated in diversity training during Rush School, focusing on issues of gender, race and sexuality in a sorority environment.
These changes were made to create a more authentic vibe for a week that sophomore Delta Gamma member Carlota Rodriguez says can be overwhelming. Rodriguez rushed as a freshman, but as an international student, she entered the process completely unprepared for its intensity.
After three days, Rodriguez dropped out of rush, certain that sorority life wasn’t for her. She focused on school and became an active member of the executive board of the Expat Society. But after befriending three fellow freshmen who were each in a different sororities, Rodriguez began to reconsider.
The communities that attracted Rodriguez were strikingly different than what she’d seen during rush — close-knit, driven groups of women absolutely foreign to the superficiality of recruitment. She decided to give rush another shot.
Since joining her sorority, many of Rodriguez’ friends have joked about her new Delta Gamma backpack, remarking that she doesn’t seem like a sorority girl. And maybe that’s true, Rodriguez said, because she certainly doesn’t fit with the image shaped by pop culture. But Rodriguez is quick to point out the Greek life at USC isn’t all like the movies.
“I think most girls come into rush with this idea of what being in a sorority is like,” Rodriguez said. “And most of those [ideas] aren’t really true to what it’s really like.”
The important thing, Rodriguez and Mowatt both say, is that there is good and bad to Greek life. This community provides supportive houses where members live, study, volunteer and bond with close, lifelong friends.
But that community isn’t always open for everyone. And while it’s a harsh truth, Mowatt believes that by accepting it, Greek life at USC can improve and grow in the future.
“I really think [the Row] can become that inclusive environment where most of the students on campus feel comfortable,” Mowatt said. “It’s not that now, but it can get there. And if you’d asked me that same question back in the ’80s, I would have said no, there’s no way. But now, I think there really is that hope for the future.”

When the word “fraternity” is mentioned around USC, it can often be marred by the words partying, privilege and controversy. One term that isn’t tossed around as often, however, is diversity.
 This isn’t the case for the 26 multicultural fraternities and sororities recognized on USC’s campus. These organizations strive to add some new terms to Greek life: inclusion, tolerance and community.
 Every fraternity and sorority at USC is overseen by a national governing body. The organizations on the Row are all overseen by either the Interfraternity Council or the Panhellenic Council. However, these organizations do not oversee multicultural fraternities. Instead, three different councils exist for these groups, each one catering to a different ethnic demographic.
 The Asian Greek Council oversees the three historically Asian sororities and two Asian fraternities on campus. The Multicultural Greek Council oversees 12 fraternities and sororities which are predominantly Latino (one of the fraternities overseen by MGC, Alpha Gamma Alpha, is historically Armenian). And the nine historically African American fraternities and sororities at USC — a group colloquially referred to as “The Divine Nine” — is overseen by the National Pan-Hellenic Council.
 According to Kathrina Ruiz, the anti-basileus (or president) of National Pan-Hellenic’s Sigma Gamma Rho, one of the main differences she sees between traditional Greek organizations and multicultural fraternities and sororities is a greater focus on community service. The work is often specifically focused on causes important to minorities. A commitment to community outreach was one of the main reasons why Sigma Gamma Rho was more attractive option for her.
 “I felt [Panhellenic] didn’t do as much community service as I wanted to do,” Ruiz said. “They do great at throwing ‘fundragers’ and stuff like that, but I don’t see them on Skid Row too often.”
 Cesar Rivas, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention and an active member of the MGC-overseen Sigma Delta Alpha, said that he never even considered joining a fraternity when he first arrived at USC. However, it was SDA’s commitment to service that made him want to become a part of the community.
 “I feel like fraternities as a whole get a very negative reputation, but particularly what I liked with Sigma Delta Alpha was what they were about,” Rivas said. “Our purpose was to graduate and spread the words of our culture — to be able to help out communities around the area and see what their needs are. That to me was really important.” 
Although having three different governing bodies may suggest that these organizations operate independently of each other, Ruiz said that this is not the case, and that many of their community events blur council lines. NPHC chapters will often partner with MGC and AGC — and occasionally with IFC — for programming each semester.
 Although these chapters coordinate with one another, Rivas believes that a focus on community service is part of why the multicultural Greek community has a lower profile than many other organizations on campus. In comparison to large parties on the Row that sometimes reach capacity after an hour, lower key events held by the multicultural fraternities draw from smaller groups of people.
 Ruiz believes that when people on campus talk about fraternities and sororities, the organizations overseen by AGC, MGC and National Pan-Hellenic are considered separate from “typical” Greek life.
 “I feel like not a lot of people know, and I feel like it comes from the fact that when people talk about ‘Greek life,’ they’re referring to the Row primarily,” Ruiz said.
 But the multicultural Greek community is much greater than just USC. According to Rivas, the network created by membership of one of these organizations transcends state lines, and can be useful. With chapters located throughout California and the U.S., members of these organizations can find a network and a community across the country.
 And this network finds its way back to USC. Oscar Salinas, an alumnus of an MGC fraternity at Arizona State University, visited USC’s campus to watch a cultural performance event put on by the Multicultural Greek Council and its members. He said that becoming a member of a multicultural fraternity means becoming a member of something much bigger — even as an alumnus.
 “I was born and raised in Arizona, I have my fraternity brothers all back home at Arizona,” Salinas said. “But I get to come to USC’s campus and see all of these Greek organizations — some of which also have chapters at ASU — and it feels like I’m at home. It feels like I’m an undergrad.” Rivas said that, despite not maintaining the highest profile on campus, he feels like the multicultural Greek community at USC is continuing to grow. Mostly, he is excited to see the Greek community continue to become more and more diverse in the future.
 “I think the future is definitely bright,” Rivas said. “I hope to see a future where we have not just a lot of people of color or Latinos and such in our fraternities and sororities, but a very diverse community.”

Last year, to address incidents of discrimination on college campuses, student leaders at USC ratified the Campus Climate Resolution. The series of recommendations, introduced in October 2015, called for administrators to implement a variety of measures to promote equity and inclusion. The Resolution created greater conversations for the student body, drawing large crowds and greater student involvement at Undergraduate Student Government proceedings.

Since then, student leaders behind the initiative feel the momentum gained throughout the semester the Resolution was instated has stalled. 
“Dialogue is action, but the change we want to see result from action is produced by momentum and engagement,” said Alex Kanegawa, a senior majoring in policy planning and development, who was one of the founding members of the Campus Climate Coalition. “Our biggest fault was focusing too hard on advocacy and policy and losing the external pressure that an agitated and passionate student public provides, giving our demands weight.”
Conversations about diversity and acceptance are particularly prevalent at diverse colleges such as USC. Of the 44,000 students enrolled at USC in Fall 2016, white students make up 33.1 percent, Hispanic students make up 13 percent, black students make up 5.6 percent, Asian students make up 17.6 percent, Native American students make up less than 1 percent while the remaining six percent are students of ‘Other’ backgrounds, according to USC Facts and Figures.
According to Gisella Tan, a senior majoring in psychology and one of the authors of the resolution, these stats are met with a disparity between positive demographics and negative experiences for minority students.
Tan joined the coalition because she wanted to be a representative of the international student body. A student from Hong Kong, Tan noticed a disjunction between USC boasting of the second largest international student body in the country and the lack of resources for these students. After the Office of International Services was shuffled from building to building in the span of just a few years, Tan felt she needed to voice the concerns of international students.
“I thought I needed to provide a voice to the things that needed to be improved, specifically for international students because they were who I was representing,” Tan said. “The resolution gave us a platform to talk to administrators, especially since it didn’t get a lot of support. It gave us leverage to speak to everyone on campus.”
A year after the passing of the Resolution, Tan has identified areas in diversity in which USC needs to improve. According to Tan, to ease the transition of adjusting to a new country, a space, much like APASS, tailored to international students, needs to be created. This would facilitate mentorship and community for the people who are at a disadvantage of creating family on campus.
Undergraduate Student Government President Edwin Saucedo, though not a part of the original campus climate coalition, said that looking forward, USG has plans to keep up the momentum of the previous administration and maintain a focus on diversity issues.
“We’re looking at ways we can improve our practices,” Saucedo said. “One of the biggest things we’re focused on is identifying individuals, faculty and students to serve on another board that would create a campus climate survey … to gather data in a more holistic way.”
Saucedo said that, in addition, this new board will evaluate the five-year plans to foster diversity created by each individual USC school’s diversity liaison. 
“Our council will be the first people reviewing [the diversity liaisons’] plans, creating a rubric, setting measurements for which we hold different schools accountable on how they’re going to address this topic for the next five years,” Saucedo said. 
However, some underrepresented students say the current efforts aren’t doing enough to encourage an inclusive campus environment.
“I don’t feel safe on campus,” said Vanessa Diaz, a USC student of color. “Understanding how other people [at USC] see me and understanding that in their eyes, I’m not welcome here, is something that I’m constantly thinking about.”
For Ozodi Onyeabor, a senior majoring in communication and a Master’s in communication management, USC does not represent a safe space. This is especially true for her after two black USC students reported being called by racial slurs on separate occasions in the aftermath of the presidential election.
But Onyeabor feels that this level of prejudice extends beyond the University. In a country racked with conflict over issues of bias and discrimination on a daily basis, she believes that the problems USC students face reflect a nationwide pattern that could define the future of the country.
“Even though, students on campus have been harassed and walk around in fear, it’s not any better outside these gates,” Onyeabor said. “I am from Dallas/Fort Worth, TX. Growing up, I faced microaggressions and I saw the dark side of [the] South. But now, since hate is emboldened with no fear of repercussions, I’m terrified to return home for the holidays. Period.”
Correction: A previous version of this article included a longer interview with Vanessa Diaz: 
“And she was disappointed to discover another truth – that diversity as reflected by numbers does not mean actual interaction between the different communities of students. According to Diaz, however, these minorities often choose not to overlap, remaining in their own homogenous bubbles. And when these groups do intersect, the result isn’t always a positive interaction.”
Once Diaz addressed inaccuracies in the aforementioned statement after publication, the interview was removed. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Senior swimmer Steven Stumph first told his teammates he was gay the summer after his sophomore year at USC. He remembers being nervous and sweating, his heart pounding heavily the entire time.
It turns out he had nothing to worry about.
“We just laughed about it like, ‘Why did I hold it in so long?’” Stumph said. “There was no reason to. All my fears of wanting to hold it in were all for nothing.”
 Stumph is part of a community of LGBT athletes and coaches at USC, ranging from openly gay athletes to those who remain closeted. Most gay athletes, coaches and administrators generally describe USC as an inclusive school for LGBT athletes, who feel safe and supported by their teammates and peers, but the University is always trying to make strides to become more accepting.
 Though athletes understandably feel apprehensive about opening up about their sexual identity, the culture at USC is welcoming to those who do, according to those at the University who have come out.
 Lypheng Kim, a junior majoring in human biology and member of the club dragon boat racing team, has been out since he was 17. As the captain of his high school track and field team, Kim said he had gained a “level of respect,” but was still a bit nervous about coming out.
 Those fears, though, were quelled when his high school coach sent him a message reading, “We are here for you to support you.”
 When Kim came to USC, he found his club team to have a similar reaction.
 “Everyone was kind to me,” he said. “They didn’t use sexuality as a basis to determine how they would treat you.”
 —
 In her four years working with LGBT athletes as a clinical and sports psychologist at USC, Nohelani Lawrence has never seen an issue regarding a player or coach based on how they identify.
 “My experience with athletes who identify as gay is they feel very supported by their teammates,” she said. “They feel free to express themselves and feel supported by their coach.”
 Lawrence is the director of the LGBT committee at USC, a group that meets to improve the treatment of LGBT athletes on campus. When she took over the committee three years ago, one of her first projects was creating a “You Can Play” video, featuring former Athletic Director Pat Haden. Rather than simply seeking acceptance of LGBT athletes, Lawrence wanted to take a step further toward appreciation.
 “Initially, there was a lot of talk about accepting student-athletes who identify as LGBT, but even accepting has a negative connotation because that implies there might be something wrong,” Lawrence said. “Our goal was to really let student-athletes know that we appreciate their presence.” 
According to Lawrence, one of the biggest complaints from the athletes she works with is trying to find other LGBT people to date. It’s a minimal issue compared to other schools, but that doesn’t mean she and LGBT athletes don’t have ways to further increase inclusivity and support on campus.
 Lawrence wants to spur the discussion on how to support transgender athletes, which she thinks is an area that hasn’t gotten much coverage. Stumph would like to see an organization for LGBT athletes where they can share updates and concerns, similar to one that exists at UC Berkeley. And Kim lamented the fact that he doesn’t see other Asian-American athletes come out, noting that he is often the “token Asian” in the room.
 “Sometimes, you just have to put yourself in that uncomfortable setting for others to speak up,” he said. “That’s been the theme of coming out as an athlete. Putting yourself in uncomfortable situations to allow others to be more comfortable to come out.” 
When Stumph was a freshman, two seniors on the swim team were openly gay. He admired that they were proud of their sexuality and didn’t let it affect their presence on the team, but he wasn’t quite ready to come out himself.
 Reed Malone, a member of the LGBT committee, is also a senior and a teammate of Stumph’s on the swim team (Malone does not identify as gay). He recalls Stumph trying to figure himself out during freshman year.
 “He was quiet. He was pretty reserved,” Malone said. “For our freshman class, there were six of us. He hung out, but liked to be on his own a bit.”
 Finally, Stumph came to terms with it.
 “I was just tired of holding it in,” he said. “It was like a big relief was lifted off my shoulders. There was nothing holding me back. No secrets.”
 The decision has made him more comfortable as a person and a teammate, more open to talk about any kind of subject and coming into his own.
 It was more of a seamless transition than an abrupt announcement for his teammates.
 “He never sat everyone down and said, ‘Yeah, I’m gay.’ He just lived his life and ended up hooking up with guys,” Malone said. “It wasn’t a huge deal to anyone.”
 —
 They didn’t say it to his face, but Kim could sometimes hear the whispers, the homophobic slurs from his teammates and competitors on his high school track and field team in Philadelphia.
 “When I hear things like that, I obviously feel uncomfortable because I question their intentions,” he said. “I question their level of awareness. I give them the benefit of the doubt, even though they’re saying those things and they’re conscious of the impact that it has. Words hurt. Words can make a huge dent on someone’s mental health or mental capacity.” 
Such incidents are far less common at USC and its neighboring schools in the liberal West Coast demographic. It’s one of the reasons why some LGBT athletes, including Stumph, chose to attend USC.  But Stumph, who is from Moraga, California — about 13 miles east of Oakland — said he would not feel safe attending a swim meet at a school like Auburn, which is located in a region that is less tolerant of the LGBT community. He noted that there are some schools where the culture is not yet ready to accommodate people like him.
 “Here I’m totally comfortable to tell anyone that I’m gay,” Stumph said. “I don’t fear for my safety.”
 Stumph is aware of gay athletes at schools on the East Coast who don’t feel comfortable coming out to their team because they fear they will be ostracized and the coach won’t put them in events.
 Then, there was the time he posted a photo to social media while visiting a friend in Austin, Texas, tagging his location.
 “Some random person wrote a very discriminatory comment on my photo,” he said. “I think that has to do with the region. In L.A., for the vast majority, people don’t care whether you’re gay or not. In Austin, it’s a bigger deal.” Stumph admitted he is more “reserved” about telling people about his sexuality in places such as Texas, where a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll last year found fewer than half of the state’s residents support gay marriage. It’s an indication that USC is far ahead of the curve in comparison to other parts of the country.
 Lawrence noted that while USC celebrated National Coming Out Day last month, passing out T-shirts for coaches and athletes to wear (they ran out by noon), some schools on the East Coast didn’t because they feared it would negatively impact recruiting and publicity. Last year, LeTourneau University, a Division III school in Longview, Texas, banned “same-sex dating behaviors” as well as advocacy for same-sex marriage for student athletes.
 For its part, the NCAA has been swift on denouncing anti-LGBT legislation. In September, NCAA President Mark Emmert took action in the wake of the so-called “Bathroom Bill” in North Carolina — which requires transgender people to use public restrooms that correspond to their gender given at birth  — by pulling seven championship events from the state in the 2016-2017 season.
 While L.A. natives may be accustomed to inclusivity, some people from other parts of the country may not be aware of the accepting environment. Lawrence, who grew up on the East Coast, said she didn’t know what to expect when she took a job at USC. She heard from people who thought the University was “extremely conservative, especially within California.” 
“I wasn’t sure here how accepting athletics would be toward LGBT athletics,” she said. “I’ve been pleasantly surprised.”
 Creating a nationwide culture of acceptance for LGBT athletes is somewhat of a dilemma. While there would be progress if more gay athletes came out, some are just not willing to take the risk to put themselves out there.
 “It’s a gradual change that needs to occur socially,” Stumph said. “I’m sure it was the same [at USC]. When the first athlete came out as gay here, it was a huge shock. As more and more come out, people realize it’s normal and not a rare occurrence.”
—
 The end goal, ultimately, is for the entire discussion over LGBT athletes to become a moot point. It’s one thing to make note of an athlete who identifies as gay. But, according to Kim, it’s another to make their sexuality the headline.
 “That title in a way perpetuates the notion that sexuality comes first before athleticism,” he said. “Sometimes, it’s a good thing and sometimes it might not be. People are so focused on the sexuality aspect that they forget about who the athlete is.” Stumph is a perfect example. The senior is much more than an athlete who is gay; he is a team captain and one of the top swimmers in the Pac-12, playing a key role for USC in dual meets and postseason action. His sophomore year, he broke the school record in the 200-yard breaststroke to help claim the first Pac-12 title in 37 years for USC.
 Outside the pool, Stumph likes to travel and cook. A self-described food connoisseur, he invites friends over and converts his apartment into a “pop-up restaurant” complete with waitresses and hostesses, cooking seven-course meals for them. Each one has a theme, from Mexican to Mediterranean to even a Halloween a few weeks ago.
 “It’s amazing food,” Malone said. “The presentation is unbelievable. Unlike everything I’ve ever seen.”
 This seemingly insignificant display represents Stumph’s transformation from shy freshman to a senior who has come to terms with who he is and beyond, showing that there is more that defines him than simply being gay. It’s part of what USC is continuously striving to improve on — making sure LGBT athletes are not just accepted, but also appreciated for more than just their sexuality.
 “He travels the world and he cooks,” Malone said of Stumph. “Being gay is such a small part of him that it doesn’t even matter.”

It was an unusual day for freshman Yash Bhartia. 
Suite 2004 was a little quiet, and still a bit unfamiliar. For the first time in his life, Bhartia felt the full weight of his distance from home sink in. He had left everything behind — his friends, family and loved ones — to pursue his education at a university more than 7,000 miles away from home in Guwahati, India. 
He missed it — the fragrant smell of turmeric in the air, the heat pressed against his skin and the taste of the pav bhaji, a vegetable curry and bread dish, that his mom made often.
So, he got out of bed. He convinced his suitemates Lance and Richard to come with him to Jitlada, a restaurant he had been dying to try since coming to USC. After eating the spiciest chicken curry in Los Angeles and watching his suitemates cry from the heat, Yash was glad he got a small taste of home — and that Lance and Richard did too. That spontaneous adventure was just the beginning for Suite 2004.
Yash Bhartia and his seven suitemates — Paulo Dela Cruz, Alvin Li, Daniel Xu, Lance Azusada, Jack Zhao, Richard Xian and Talman Fortune  — have found a home with each other, despite coming from eight different backgrounds.
Chinese, Filipino, Indian, white, gay, straight — those are just some of the unique identities that these eight suitemates carry. Those identities have shaped and strengthened the boys’ friendships with one another.
Though none of them originally applied to live at the International Residential College, the eight freshmen ended up together through randomized housing assignments. 
“It was very interesting meeting all of my suitemates,” Azusada said. “I come from Palmdale, where the majority of people I knew were Hispanic or black, so it was amazing coming to USC and living with people from so many different places and backgrounds.”
At first, these differences weren’t apparent. 
As a 17-year-old from Guam, Dela Cruz didn’t think much of the people he would later call his suitemates. For all his life, he had grown up with the same people — some Filipino, some Chamorro, the indigenous people who live on the island. Familiarity was a way of life on the island, but after arriving at the University, he realized that things were about to change. 
Living with a group of strangers from all different corners of life was a new and strange experience for him. And differences had to be set aside. 
“There’s been a lot of lessons learned during my short time here,” Dela Cruz said. “I knew there were things I had to change about myself to figure out my way in college.”
Dela Cruz knew there were things he needed to sort out with his suitemates. He knew himself too well to dismiss his own identity to the people he was living with. It was the little things, from his faded purple hair to the way he dressed, and he understood that he needed to remain true to himself in order to mature. So, after being out to his friends and family, he decided that it was time to come out to his suitemates.
Initially, things were awkward. Coming from India, Bhartia found it difficult to understand his suitemate’s circumstance. He experienced a new form of culture shock. He never had these conversations back home, where homosexuality is generally considered taboo.
“At first, it was really difficult because there were just things that [Yash] wasn’t used to, especially because of his background,” Dela Cruz said. “I really wanted to show him that even though being gay is part of my identity, it does not define me.” 
After speaking together privately, the two emerged with a better understanding of one another’s identities. And according to Dela Cruz, “The dynamic is back again.” 
On the other hand, Azusada began to realize he identified more with his Filipino background than he previously thought. Azusada grew up in Historic Filipinotown without knowing any Tagalog. After moving to Palmdale during his formative years, he thought he had left behind a large part of his Filipino culture in exchange for “being Americanized.” 
“Living in Hi-Fi was pretty interesting,” he said. “[My parents] did not teach me any Tagalog, so it was tough being surrounded by people who were Filipino and knew Tagalog, and feeling less Filipino than them because of the language barrier.” 
Since coming to USC, Azusada has joined Dela Cruz in Troy Philippines, the only Filipino culture club on campus. Reconnecting with his culture, he was reminded of the values his family raised him with — Filipino values, to be precise. And for him, it’s the little things that matter.
“I still take my shoes off when I come back into my room,” he said. “I ask my friends to do it as well whenever they visit. In the Philippines, there’s a lot of poverty, so a lot of Filipinos take cleanliness very seriously. I’m one of those people.”
Xian didn’t come from one neighborhood like Azusada — he grew up all around the world, from China to Philadelphia to South Africa. One thing was certain though —he had never actually experienced Indian culture. 
Despite crying and sweating for several hours after trying a spicy curry dish at Bhartia’s insistence, he was not apprehensive about wanting to learn more about his suitemate.
During the last weekend of October, he decided to spend Diwali with Bhartia. Diwali, which took place on Oct. 30, is a Hindu tradition that celebrates light and goodness. Though he did not wear any traditional garb, Xian took this opportunity to get to know his roommate better.
“I asked questions about what people do on Diwali, how they dress,” Xian said. “I was interested, and from my experience, it was a lot of fun getting to learn more about Yash and his traditions.” 
Learning and understanding each other’s cultures was a common theme when it came to creating relationships in Suite 2004. After getting comfortable with each other, however, the suitemates went beyond learning to experiencing.
Despite being Chinese, Xu made a conscious decision to join the Korean American Student Association with his suitemate Paulo. Like many other students who come to USC, KASA is a melting pot of identities — and it isn’t uncommon to have students of all different backgrounds, Asian or non-Asian. Participating in an annual competition called Dance Off, Xu began to learn more about not only Korean culture, but also those of many of his peers. 
He also reconnected with his own heritage.
“Being away from family and not speaking Chinese as well some other people here made me realize that maybe it’s time for change,” Xu said. 
Xu has been looking into taking Chinese courses for spring semester. Though these steps are small, he hopes that he’ll be able to come out of college with a stronger connection to his family, and to his Chinese heritage.
The eight attribute many of their learning experiences, about their own cultures and others, to each other. 
“My suitemates and IRC have taught me a lot, and also have driven me to be a better student,” Azusada said. “Coming here, I had a lot of stereotypes and expectations about what I thought USC would be like. But everything’s been very different from what I anticipated, and I’m glad that my suitemates have shaped my experience as a student here in some way.”
There seems to never be a dull night in Suite 2004. Since becoming suitemates, the eight have learned a lot about each other, from Bhartia’s obsession with American television to Li’s extreme study habits. It’s not only the way they live, but also the conversations they’ve had together, that truly allowed their relationships to grow beyond IRC. 
“We can go hours on end talking to each other about literally anything and everything,” Xian said. “On some nights, we just gather in Daniel and Yash’s room to eat and talk about life for probably about three hours until we realize that we should have done our homework.” 
Like any other first-year students and their roommates, the eight have created a dynamic friendship together. For them, it isn’t just about going to parties together (though they still do) or being around each other all the time. Even though their majors and extracurricular activities all differ from one another, they share one thing in common — their excitement to come back home to IRC every night. 
“We might be the same, and we might be different in some ways,” Xian said. “But we see each other beyond our beliefs and our cultures. We see each other as suitemates, as friends and as people.”

Panelists discussed the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election and speculated about the next four years under a Donald Trump presidency at the “Road to the White House: Final Thoughts” event at the Davidson Conference Center on Tuesday evening. 
Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, co-moderated the panel with Daily Trojan Editor-in-Chief Matt Lemas. 
The panel featured: Tim Clark, Southwest U.S. political coordinator at Donald J. Trump  for President; Brian Calle, vice president and opinion editor for The Orange County Register; Bill Burton, California managing director for SKDKnickerbocker; Wendy Greuel, a commissioner on the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority’s Board of Commissioners; Ben Austin, board member for Students Matter; Mary Perez, vice president of the USC College Republicans; and Anthony Boulahoud, finance director for USC College Democrats. 
“My interaction with Trump is fundamentally the interaction that you have with the CEO of an organization, and I believe that what you’re going to see from President Trump is a CEO,” Clark said. “My interaction has been with somebody who has a hunger for knowledge for this organization, someone who has a knowledge for what potential fixes are, is looking at data and making decisions.”
Calle conveyed more skepticism than Clark for the potential change the Trump presidency can bring. 
“There is potential for Donald Trump to be a very good president; there is potential for Donald Trump to be a very bad president. There is potential for Donald Trump to be the last president,” Calle said jokingly. “But my sense of Donald Trump is this: I think [he] is going to moderate himself and measure himself a little bit. Donald Trump has a brand that people are familiar with, so I think Donald Trump is going to be Donald Trump.”
Calle added that Trump has already started to take a less brash approach to politics, a change from his campaign trail persona. For Calle, that is a positive sign of more changes to come.
Perez explained the need for Republicans and society as a whole to develop a more inclusive mindset.
“Going forward, we want to craft a message that says, ‘hey, we are the party for all people, for all Americans, we want to represent all minorities, all races, all religious practices, all sexual orientations,’” Perez said. “But, at the same time, we don’t want to lose sight of working class, white-collar Americans who came out for Mr. Trump and their interest in the equation too. They’re an important part of our electorate.” 
Perez added that there needs to be an end to labelling those with conservative views as xenophobes, bigots and racists. 
“I know that there are [xenophobic, bigoted and racist conservatives] out there, but if we can unify and work together without labeling people, that’s going to be the most constructive and important thing that we can do continuing forward,” Perez said.
Boulahoud emphasized the necessity of unity after the election and how the party should continue to strengthen.
“We need to move forward and we need to progress together. And we believe that means starting at the local level and working our way up,” Boulahoud said. “We probably need to lean more towards the center, so that we can bring people together. That’s probably the best thing to do.”
Greuel addressed the surge in hate crimes that have taken place in the aftermath of Trump’s victory.
“I think that Donald Trump is starting to stop the different things that are happening,” Greuel said. “[This is] a very critical time for our future and the diversity of our country to say we are a nation of a lot of people. When you get elected president of the United States you represent those that voted for you and those that did not vote for you,” Greuel said.
Concise. Balanced. Perfect. Great reporting, Sofia Bosch!

Undergraduate Student Government Senator Kate Oh, along with Senator and Speaker Pro Tempore Paul Samaha, introduced a resolution calling on administration to designate USC a sanctuary campus during Tuesday evening’s USG Senate meeting. 
The resolution states that “USG calls on the university administration to explicitly label the University of Southern California a sanctuary campus, publicly and unequivocally declaring the University’s support for and protection of undocumented students, staff and their families on campus.” 
It also calls on the University to make sure that students who have utilized the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program will retain aid and support, regardless of whether the program is slashed. The resolution further requests that the university administration not release information about student and staff immigration status and not yield to authorities who attempt deportations or raids.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has already designated L.A. as a sanctuary city, which does not have a specific legal meaning, but rather signifies that the city will take steps to ensure that undocumented people living within it will not face federal prosecution by that city’s officials simply due to their immigration status. There are, however, other steps that a city, or by extension USC, can take to provide shelter for immigrants.
“One thing [the administration] is considering is having legal aid for undocumented students, staff, et cetera,” Senator Sabrina Enriquez said. “That could also mean having an undocumented [students] resource center, or renewing the lease on the university church; it is the only place on campus that has autonomy currently, which means federal agents could not enter the church, as it is a sacred space.”
Enriquez also brought up that historically, USC has made a different choice regarding the safety of at-risk groups on campus. During the World War II era, Japanese and Japanese American students and staff on campus were not provided sanctuary by then President Rufus B. Von KleinSmid. Rather, Von KleinSmid supported the internment of these students, and also prevented them from being able to transfer to Midwestern schools by preventing their transcripts from being sent, according to Enriquez.
“We heard what happened with the Japanese internment camps, how USC complied with that, and we don’t want to be on the wrong side of history again,” Samaha said. “We have a chance to help lead a wave of schools that will protect their undocumented students and to help lead a national change as well.”
Oh also gave an update on her projects, including the implementation of an Asian Pacific Islander and Desi American special interest floor next year in Birnkrant Residential College. She also plans to work with Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services to have a more thorough discussion about consent with students.
“Title IX works on prevention and education, but I really did not see that happening,” Oh said. “Especially as an RA; usually RAs take their residents during Welcome Week to have a discussion of consent, but that didn’t happen this year.”
USG President Edwin Saucedo gave a report on the projects he is working on. He first brought up the possibility of expanding available resources for first-generation college students, proposing the possibility of a resource center. Saucedo said that many of the current resources available for students who were the first in their families to go to college are specifically aimed at those who either have scholarships or are of certain ethnicities. 
Saucedo also brought up the ongoing discussion around the possible addition of a fall break, separate from the one during Thanksgiving. The proposed break would take place around the eighth week of school, when there is an increased number of students visiting the counseling center. 
USG Senator Emily Lee gave a presentation on a few initiatives she has been able to implement, including recycling bins in USC housing, extended dining hours at Parkside Cafe and Grill and a public Senate voting record. She is looking into possibly banning styrofoam use within USG and figuring out a way to help residents in first-year communities who are required to purchase full meal plans but are unable to afford meals during breaks when dining halls are closed.
If USC violates our immigration laws, its students and USC will face total cutoff in both financial aid and NIH funding, among other federal funding.  This would have disastrous effects on the students who need financial aid and USC research.  The USC administrators — and USC’s alumni and donors — are not that stupid.  Instead, USC can offer some assistance for the students affected by helping them complete the paperwork needed to remain in the country legally.

Christian Eder, a graduate of the USC Marshall School of Business and the current head of finance at a startup in San Francisco, grew up in Austria before coming to the United States to pursue his education. Eder said that though he had exciting opportunities to study and work here, during the first few months, he faced difficulties adapting to living and studying in the U.S., especially when it came to understanding international work visas.
Eder and a team of international students with professional careers founded Interstride with the purpose of tackling this problem for a new generation of international students. The free service matches students who text “hello” to (415) STRIDE3 with former international students who can then provide help and resources. 
Eder explained that though many schools have international student offices, they are often already working on other much-needed services, leaving limited resources to be provided for personal consulting. Even if schools do offer consulting services, students need to take time out of their busy schedules to meet face-to-face. Interstride hopes it can solve this problem by serving as a complimentary service to what international student offices are currently providing. 
Eder said that the counselors Interstride provides can easily be reached for guidance on a variety of topics, including culture shock, language barriers, work visas, homesickness, housing issues and problems fitting into the new environment. He explained that since professors and recruiters judge students equally, international students have to work harder to overcome certain obstacles that local students don’t face, such as language barriers and issues getting a work visa. 
“Our consultants, who are all volunteers, have real-life experiences on how to effectively resolve all these difficulties and can provide advice and resources [through] the convenience of texting,” Eder said. 
Eder said that his team chose texting over phone calls as a means for reaching out to students because of the convenience and accessibility of texting.
“[Our] counselors are busy working professionals who commit a few hours a week, and texting is easier than scheduling a phone call,” Eder said. “There is also plenty of research out there that millennials prefer texting over voice or even face-to-face interactions, so we believe that this channel fits our solution best.” 
Anita Dushyanth, an equity research analyst and volunteer consultant at Interstride, said that when she first came to study in the United States, she was overwhelmed by the difficulty of adjusting to American culture and keeping up with the rigorous academic curriculum. She explained that many international students find getting a job after graduation while maintaining a legal immigration status to be challenging. 
“It is a tough reality for internationals to navigate the immigration system, which can be downright confusing,” Dushyanth said. 
Dushyanth said she hopes that with her expertise in such areas, she can provide support and guidance to the many international students that deal with the problems she also faced. 
Interstride is planning on getting the word out to schools where its volunteers are alumni. Eder also said he hopes Interstride will become the first national helpline where former and current international students can connect through texting.
“My family is many time zones away, I still have an accent, and I still do mental math in German,” Eder said. “I feel lucky about my career in the U.S., and I want to give back to the international student community.”
