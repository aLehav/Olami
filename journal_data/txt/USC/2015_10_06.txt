Students gathered on Tuesday evening in Doheny Memorial Library to discuss the drought in California with a panel of distinguished speakers at an event hosted by the Speakers Committee.
The panel included USC professor Kelly Sanders, who is part of Forbes magazine’s “30 Under 30” list of distinguished persons; UCLA professor and USC visiting professor Matthew Kahn, who authored several books on environmental issues; Steve Scauzillo, a writer and editor for the San Gabriel Valley News; Massoud Pirbazari, a professor of civil and environmental engineering; and Ian James, a reporter for Desert Sun and the winner of the Knight-Risser Prize for Western Environmental Journalism in 2014.
“It’s currently the fourth driest year in the history of California,” Kahn said. “Technically, a drought is, by [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] standards, when water levels reach below a threshold of average rainfall.”
The panelists discussed issues related to the drought, such as pollution of existing water, fracking, climate change and ways to control California’s water supply.
“I think that’s why early action is very important,” Sanders said regarding what could be done about the drought. “I think we have to get more efficient [with] the water that we use locally so I think water recycling is absolutely key. We need to learn to use more of the water that is in the system already and we have to get better at collecting storm water.”
Pirbazari said California could do more to address the drought.
“What other countries across the world are doing to combat droughts really puts California to shame. We must innovate and adopt techniques that will help us survive in this drought,” Pirbazari said.
Sanders remained optimistic.

“California will prevail,” Sanders said after the event. “I think this drought is really going to force us to rethink a lot of the ways that we manage our water and the ways that we interact with our water.”
The event was moderated by Kevin Kassel, the founding president of the club H2O, which aims to increase access to clean water.
“I thought the discussion was pretty interesting, as there were many different perspectives on the same issue,” Kassel said.
Measrainsey Meng, a first-year environmental engineering doctoral. student, agreed with Kassel, noting the diversity of the panel speakers.
“I thought it was a really great panel because it had panelists from different disciplines, so there were two engineers, two writers and one economist, and I think each person brought a different perspective to the table.”

This event was the latest installment in the Trending Topics series, and was co-sponsored by the Political Student Assembly and the Environmental Student Assembly.
Trending Topics is a new series started this semester by the  Speakers Committee and aims to shed light on current events that students think are most relevant.
Co-director of Trending Topics, Melissa Feldman said that the topics were chosen by USC students themselves through a survey that the committee sent out over the summer.

The directors of the Academic Culture Assembly presented their plans for the upcoming Mental Health Awareness Month last night at the Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The MHA Month will run from Oct. 12-Nov. 20.
Hannah Nguyen, executive director of ACA, discussed the event’s importance.
“This is the first even mental health awareness month at USC,” Nguyen said. “We really felt that mental health was a growing issue on our campus that affects so many students, but there’s such a stigma around it that nobody really talks about it.”
Nguyen stressed the importance of recognizing mental health issues at USC. She said that ample research shows that mental illness is more prevalent on college campuses.
“[This is] not only because of stress due to midterms and exams and school, but also just the pressures for marginalized students that are first generation or who identify as queer, trans or gender nonconforming,” Nguyen said.

When entering into an environment where they feel unsafe, Nguyen explained, these students have a greater chance of having their mental health adversely impacted.
“We really wanted to approach this issue in a nuanced manner to really have these types of conversations around mental health throughout our programming,” Nguyen said.
Some of the signature activities in the month-long event include a Student Stories Panel; a Resource Fair, where students can learn about resources both on and off campus that they can access if they are struggling with their mental health; a Counselor Meet & Greet, where students can “mingle and speak to counselors in a casual setting about what they do”; a slam poetry night, where students can “express their experiences” with mental health; and weekly de-stress workshops where “students can unwind during this midterm season.”
“We’re having [the de-stress sessions] every Monday at Tommy Trojan, except for one Monday where we will be at McCarthy Quad doing yoga,” Nguyen said. “It’s kind of hard to do yoga on the concrete.”
Another event will be a puppy-petting session, when a person from the Disability Students’ Association will talk about the differences between emotional support dogs and therapy dogs.
Luis Vidalon-Suzuki, ACA’s assistant director, explained that one of key characteristics of the MHA month is its comprehensive approach to addressing mental health.
“We want to emphasize the importance of collaboration with the cultural assemblies because … mental health is not a box. It intersects so much with students’ identities,” Vidalon-Suzuki said. “There isn’t just one narrative behind mental health awareness. There isn’t just one manner to tackle this. There are so many factors involved. We have a holistic approach to mental health awareness.”
Nguyen also talked about ongoing work to ensure a more welcoming campus community.
“The experiences that marginalized students face have serious implications for their mental health,” Nguyen said. “Efforts to create safer spaces, efforts to prevent sexual assault, efforts to provide gender neutral bathrooms and housing for gender nonconforming students, efforts to fight racial bias and sexism and homophobia on our campus, have everything to do with mental health and need to prioritized.”
Another major event in MHA month will be the screening of Silver Linings Playbook on Oct. 15 in McCarthy Quad. The film deals explicitly with mental health issues.
“We’re having Sprinkles cupcakes that are fall-themed,” Nguyen said. “We’re gonna have hot cider, hot chocolate and hot tea, all the good stuff. But hopefully, the screening will really provoke discussion about the topic of mental health.”

At a registered party hosted by the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity on Saturday night, a drone managed by the event planning company Extreme Greeks fell on a party attendee, causing her to be transported to a local hospital.
According to a Department of Public Safety report, the person in question was a non-USC female who suffered a cut to her head after the drone, which was being used to take aerial photos of the event, fell from the sky.
“I’m glad to say that the girl is doing fine after what happened Saturday night,” Pi Kappa Phi president Austin Horton said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We are working with Extreme Greeks to determine what caused the drone to fall.”
Events of this magnitude are officially cleared with USC and DPS, which helps ensure a quicker response time when incidents like this do occur.
“Companies like Extreme Greeks provide added security to make a safer environment for social functions at USC,” said Jake Simon, president of the Interfraternity Council.
Both IFC and Pi Kappa Phi declined to address whether the company would be facing any legal action as a result of the incident.
Extreme Greeks also declined to comment on the incident.
The Delta Chi fraternity’s fall register this Saturday is also employing Extreme Greeks. However, the fraternity’s social chair, Spencer Gilbert, has confirmed they will not be using drones.

Alumnus Johnny Strange, a well-known BASE jumper, mountain climber and surfer, died while attempting to BASE jump off of a mountain in the Swiss Alps last Thursday. He was 23.
Strange crashed into the side of a mountain around noon, ending a life that was filled with daring risks and daredevil stunts.
Strange lived a life dedicated to adventure and adrenaline. By the age of 17, he was the youngest person to climb the highest mountains on all seven continents. In his sophomore year at USC, Strange completed the final leg of the Explorers Grand Slam — climbing mountains on all seven continents and visiting both poles — by skydiving from 8,000 feet in the North Pole.
Strange came from a family of adventurers. His parents, Brian and Dianette, trekked around the world to compete in adventure races that involved hiking, climbing, rappelling and kayaking. Strange and his two sisters, Brianna and MacKenna, followed their parents, and the family’s adventurous spirit rubbed off on Strange.
The first activity that Strange became involved in was mountain climbing — something that used up the abundant energy that often drove his parents wild when he was younger. Soon, climbing became more than a hobby or an afternoon pastime for Strange, and he began to pick up other interests. He became a martial artist, a big-wave surfer, a scuba diver and a paraglider. It was the final activity that cost Strange his life, but his lifestyle was one that he cherished greatly.
“If I can say anything about Johnny, it’s that he really did live every day to the fullest and not in some cliche way. He never did what he didn’t feel like doing unless it was for our family, and he was really the best in the world at his sport,” Brianna Strange said.

Strange had always been one to take risks. His sister recalled a story of the day he decided to break the world record for speed on a skateboard. He held onto the back of a truck by one finger and reached 102 miles per hour on the highway, skateboard wobbling under his feet from the speed. When the board flew out from under him, Strange launched himself into the back of the truck to save himself from crashing.
“That was Johnny,” Brianna Strange said.
The day that Strange died, his plan was to BASE jump off of Mount Gitschen in Switzerland. Winds were powerful and choppy, something Strange noted before his jump. He had posted several videos of other jumps in Switzerland in the days leading up to his death. Besides poor conditions, it is uncertain what caused Strange to crash.
Strange is one of 25 BASE jumpers to die while jumping this year. One of the other BASE jumpers was Dean Potter, a world-renowned climber and adventurer who Strange openly admired. After Potter’s death in May, Strange posted on Instagram, mourning the loss of his idol.
“See you on the other side,” he wrote in the post.
“I made the mistake of reading the first few comments on one of his articles, and what I realized people don’t understand is that Johnny and people like Johnny have a certain hunger for life that is actually unstoppable,” Brianna Strange said. “Even if we could’ve taken away his wings and stopped his plane to Switzerland, and even if we could’ve grounded him forever, he would’ve found another way to go fast and to push the limits of what anyone thought was physically possible.”
While at USC, Strange majored in international relations and dedicated his free time to his two advocacy efforts — stopping genocide and curing Parkinson’s disease. He often used his status as a world-famous adventurer to raise awareness for both campaigns, holding signs that read “Stop genocide” while posing on top of mountains and then posting them on his Instagram. This effort reflected Strange’s approach to life: always attempting to make a difference in as many ways as possible. A passionate Oakland Raiders fan, Strange also commonly donned a Raiders helmet while skydiving.
Strange was also a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, where he met Brett Linkletter during rush sophomore year. Linkletter remembers that they were a little worried that Strange’s propensity for risk would cause him to hurt himself, but Strange quickly became one of his closest friends.
“He was a puppy dog,” Linkletter said. “He constantly needed excitement, needed to infuse even the most boring things with energy and life and adventure. He was incredible to be around.”
After college, Strange often stayed with Linkletter in between his trips. Linkletter took pictures for Strange and advised him on how to manage his digital presence properly. The night before he died, Strange texted Linkletter a picture, asking if it looked “epic” enough to post on Instagram. Linkletter told him yes, encouraged him to post it and then went to bed. Linkletter woke up to a phone call from a close family friend with the news. For an hour, he refused to believe it. It was only when a second friend, another fraternity brother, called him that it sunk in — Strange was gone. Linkletter admits that it’s still hard to think about.
“It’s one of those things that your brain refuses to process,” Linkletter said. “He was always doing what he loved no matter what. He knew the dangers behind it, people encouraged him not to do it, but he never fell to traditional pressure from other people. He knew what he wanted to do, and he enjoyed it. That rubbed off on me a lot.”

Linkletter spoke to the Sigma Chi fraternity about Strange on Monday night. He told them about the legacy that Strange leaves behind, one that goes beyond world records and incredible stunts. He told them that what he remembers most of his friend is a young man who refused to let others define him, who stayed humble despite his accomplishments and  challenged the fraternity to live on in the same way, with that same pride and confidence. Strange inspired him to live an extraordinary life, to start his own marketing business and take risks. That passion and free-spirited nature is best summed up in a quote Strange gave earlier this year — a quote that Linkletter hopes to honor for the rest of his life.
“The day I let my fear deter my ability to follow my dreams, I have already died,” Strange wrote in a blog post on his website. “I will, as well as everyone else die someday, but on this day, I was more alive than I had ever been before.”
The Strange family will host a memorial service next Monday to honor Strange. The family will wear black and gray to support Strange’s favorite team, play a game of football and share stories from Strange’s life. Though he only lived to 23, family and friends agreed that Strange lived more in those years than most live in 80 or 90. His memorial will be a celebration — not a mourning — for a life well-lived and filled with purpose and adventure.
Strange is survived by his mother, father and two sisters.

Reversion is a movie that will likely pass over most viewer’s radars and fade into the pit of forgotten films. First, it is a small-budget production of only about half a million dollars. It is also written and directed by the virtually unknown Jose Nestor Marquez, whose other two films, Isa and Ana Maria in Novela Land ,were released in 2014 and 2015, respectively. These factors make it rather unfortunate because this film, though perhaps not the most astute piece of cinema to grace screens this year, is a clever and entertaining movie that is definitely worth watching.
Reversion follows protagonist Sophie Clé (Aja Naomi King), the daughter of a very wealthy medical researcher (Colm Feore) who has decided to expand his horizons and develop a new gadget called the Oubli. The Oubli looks a little like a gold wishbone that rests behind a person’s ear. Accompanied by an all-too-real looking app, the Oubli enables consumers to revisit their happiest memories with incredible clarity (“with just one tap you can experience the greatest moments of your life”), and a seemingly positive side effect is that troubling memories might temporarily fade. Early in the movie, Sophie is kidnapped by an anonymous individual who claims that Sophie’s father is not the benevolent benefactor he claims to be. What unfolds is an action-packed film, filled with truly unexpected twists as Sophie battles to regain control over her own memories.
There are, however, some fundamental weaknesses that point to an inexperienced director. To begin, the title sequence stretches on for several minutes, accompanied by nothing but blurred images and background music. In this way, Marquez begins to lose the audience’s interest no more than five minutes into the movie. Additionally, the relationship between Sophie and her father, which forms the backbone of the plot, is often wooden and awkward. Though King and Feore individually play their roles reasonably well, their dialogue with each other is forced and uncomfortable, pointing to really poor chemistry. This is first illustrated through a conversation they have at the beginning of the movie, which is positively agonizing to sit through. The music, however, does a lot of the heavy lifting. The score is impressive and does an excellent job of building up tension and suspense; however, the music is often used in place of sub-par acting or a rather banal shot of a character running or looking scared. In this case, it is so blatantly clear that it becomes more of a burden than a simple addition to the chemistry of the movie.
At times it feels like Marquez is trying too hard to be too artsy and clever with his filmmaking, awkwardly using obscure shots and camera angles where they are not needed. It also seems as though the vast majority of the film is spent in close-ups of King’s face, and though she handles the weight of the film admirably, it often feels intrusive and even boring to spend so much time simply focused on one face.
Despite this, the movie still explores some interesting themes and raises a lot of questions about the ethics of technology. Specifically, the movie forces the viewer to question our ownership of our own memories in a society ruled by social media and the concept of human emotion as a commodity. Once again, the suspense in this film is truly excellent — even if the music is a heavy contributor to this. It is unclear what the intention of any character is, so the audience questions everything and trusts no one. Flashes of Sophie’s deceased mother in her final moments penetrate the narrative at unexpected times, adding an element of horror to the story.
In the end, Reversion is a movie that will keep people entertained, and, at times, on the edge of their seats. It has its problems and is unlikely to achieve much notoriety. Still, it is an enjoyable movie. It forces the audience to question how much  they would be willing to give up to technology and how much power they are willing to sacrifice. There’s also the question of how memories and emotions can be bought and sold. Ultimately, any movie that questions the technologically-driven aspect of society is definitely worth a couple of hours of time.

Tucked away near Los Angeles International Airport in what initially looks to be an industrial warehouse on Aviation Boulevard, Aerial Physique has transformed a 10,000-square-foot space into a silk performer’s dream. The studio moved to its new location on Oct. 4, after spending almost three years at its previous location it shared with a pilates studio in Santa Monica. One look inside, and it’s clear this space is meant strictly for silk — the only other classes held at the location are silk classes for kids through Le Petit Cirque. Beautiful silks in red, blue, teal and purple drop from the 26-foot ceiling. The reason for the big move? Owner Jill Franklin’s clientele was quickly expanding and she was in need of a bigger space.
Though Franklin didn’t get into aerial performance until her 20s, you’d never know it by her strength and grace on the silks. She started ballet when she was three, and originally wanted to be a prima ballerina. After moving to New York to try her hand at Broadway — a dream that didn’t work out — she switched her focus and put her energy into trying something new: aerial yoga. Almost nine years later, Franklin has published an aerial tutorial book entitled Beginner’s Guide to Aerial Silk, maintains a hit YouTube channel and her own clothing line, all along with her own studio, Aerial Physique.
My class at Aerial Physique started off with some basic warmups. Franklin was present at the studio — she had just taught two more advanced classes before my introductory class — but my class was taught by Kylie, who had been doing aerial for several years. Because classes require a lot of instruction and understanding, each aerial class is capped at six students. To start the class, we all gathered in a circle on the mats for introductions and some stretching. As we introduced ourselves around the circle, it became clear that this was a different kind of class; we were all going to be working very closely together. I quickly noticed the varying degree of flexibility around me, and it was clear that I was the least flexible of the group. Though aerial is more collaboration than competition, I had trouble holding back my competitive spirit as Kylie led us into lunges and splits. Envious of other people’s flexibility, I pushed myself further and further into a lunge; I’m pretty sure I pulled my hamstring trying to keep up.
After warmups, Kylie transitioned the class to the silks with climbing. Climbing a silk might be very similar to climbing a rope, but I hadn’t climbed a rope since my seventh grade gym class and was not too keen on starting again now. I stayed back to observe the first round — as a class of six, we took turns on three silks — working up my confidence. I was nervous when my turn came around, but took solace in the support of the class. To my surprise, once my arms got over the initial shock of carrying my own body weight, climbing was a breeze. With every inch I climbed, I gained new confidence for the rest of the class.
The first half of the class consisted of silk fundamentals. Kylie taught us how to tie a hammock knot, wrap our wrists, flip our bodies into an upside-down straddle and tie our feet into single-foot locks. Watching Kylie perform each move looked like a beautiful magic trick, but the art of silk mastery really lies in practice, with a surprisingly quick learning curve. These moves are considered the basics of silk, but require a lot of upper body and core strength that were by no means easy. My body seemed to give up on me as I struggled to flip into an inverted tuck — I cheated a little by propelling my feet off of the silks mid-air — and then extended my legs into a position called candlestick, which looks exactly like it sounds.
Once we got the hang of moving with the silks, we finally learned some beginners’ tricks, which included the side-hip lean and the lay-back arch, both combining several of the moves and knots we learned at the beginning of class. The choreography of silk was probably the most difficult part for me, as each move was like learning a new dance, and we could say I have two left feet. I would get myself into a position only to forget what came next, and though I felt as graceful as Kylie had looked during demonstration, upon analysis of some pictures, my lines were hardly elegant, and my form was not great. Regardless of my lack of personal grace, the class was an absolute blast. My arms and core killed me, but I felt like a circus performer and total rockstar in mid-air.
Franklin recommends that clients come twice a week to see continuous progress in their aerial skills. For interested students, Aerial Physique offers introductory, beginner, intermediate and advanced silk classes, as well as a class in Aerial Lyra. Students can take anywhere from two months to two years to progress to the next level, and the studio encourages students to go at their own pace. A single group class costs $30, but the studio offers both private and group packages for a variety of prices. As for the benefits of aerial yoga? Increased flexibility, a mind and body workout, a great time, and if nothing else, Jill says, “The yogis say that being upside down prevents gray hair!”

Back-to-back · Junior Karen Chung led the Women of Troy to a fifth place finish at the Windy City Intercollegiate. She has kicked off the season with the Women of Troy’s best back-to-back performance since 2013. – Courtesy of Sports Information
On Tuesday, the men’s and women’s golf teams concluded tournaments in Portland and Chicago, respectively. The men’s golf team finished three days of play in the Nike Golf Collegiate Invitational with a tie for second place, while the women’s team finished in fifth place at the Windy City Collegiate.
Senior Andrew Levitt had a career-best performance, tying for fifth place and shooting a 67 in his final round. Sophomore Jonah Texeira tied with Levitt in the fifth spot to lead the Trojans to a second place finish. Levitt and Texeira tied for fifth at 9-under 206.
Wake Forest finished in sole possession of the title while USC and Duke tied for second. The Trojans combined for a 34-under 826. Four Trojans shot a combined 12-under on the final nine holes to come close to Wake Forest, but could not catch the Demon Deacons, who led the entire match.
Levitt and Texeira stayed mostly even during the first nine but really gained momentum on the final nine holes. Levitt had six birdies on the final nine holes to shoot for 5-under. Texeira had four birdies to shoot 4-under.
“Andrew had a great summer. We are proud of him for getting through a rough patch with his golf and coming out the other side,” head coach Chris Zambri said. “We definitely wanted to win and are disappointed that we did not. That being said, there were some really great things out of everyone, but especially Andrew and Jonah.”
Sophomore Sean Crocker shot 6-under and tied for 16th place, junior Rico Hoey shot 5-under to tie for 19th and freshman Justin Suh finished in a tie at 39th at par 215.
The men’s golf team will play  Oct. 16-18 at the U.S. Collegiate Championship in Alpharetta, Georgia.
Junior Karen Chung led the Women of Troy to a fifth place finish in Chicago with a tie for second place while junior Tiffany Chan tied for 14th place.
The Women of Troy were in the hunt for a consecutive win to open the season but fell short in the end of the match. Northwestern, Arizona and Georgia finished in a three-way tie for first at 12-under 852 while Arizona State took fourth at 11-under 853.
Chung opened the season with a win at 12-under last week and followed that up with a tie for second at 7-under 209. It is USC’s best back-to-back finishes since senior Kyung Kim opened the 2013-14 season with a win and tied for second at this same event.
Chan tied for 14th at 2-under 214 while junior Gabriella Then tied for 19th at 1-under 215, each finishing in the top 20 for the second consecutive tournament.
The Women of Troy will next play at the Stanford Intercollegiate on Oct. 18-20 at the Stanford G.C.

Run, Rogers, run · Junior wide receiver Darreus Rogers has been limited in practice due to a hamstring injury he suffered during USC’s win at ASU. – Tal Volk| Daily Trojan
Head coach Steve Sarkisian called Tuesday’s practice a “thinking day,” as the Trojans polished their game plan for Washington. He appeared pleased, remarking that the team looked focused, and where they need to be.
Tuesday morning, Sarkisian showed his players a video of the Seahawks’ Kam Chancellor to express the importance of punching the ball out and never ending the play. USC has stressed creating turnovers all year, and they hope to build off their successful outing against Arizona State, where they had four.
“We think we can be unique in that way — at creating turnovers,” Sarkisian said. “I just don’t want to back off it. I want to make sure we are attacking the football defensively, and we are doing everything we in our power to take care of the ball on offense and on special teams.”
Thursday’s game dramatizes the paradoxical problem that is being a student-athlete.
Sarkisian said that some players are being bussed from the team hotel to campus to take midterms, and then being taken back to join the team before the game.
“I think that it is a great venue for us. We take pride in playing there,” Sarkisian said. “I think that people were trying to figure out: What is this new offense? When are we supposed to cheer? When is the band supposed to play after a first down? But I think that everyone is starting to catch on and that our students have been tremendous. I know everybody is excited about tomorrow night’s ball game.”
Sarkisian understands the plight his players withstand for the better of the team, on and off the field.
“We’ll handle it really well. We’ve got really good people in place to take care of our guys to make sure they are getting everything done, whether it is on field or off the field,” Sarkisian said. “I think that this is just another cool opportunity for us to show who we are and what we are about, and how we can handle more than just playing the game between the lines.”
At this point in the season, Sarkisian said the Trojans have figured out a few things about themselves. Though he admits that he expected “growing pains,” as a result of playing younger players as much as possible early in the year, he anticipates the                 in-game experience will develop the team’s depth going forward. And though they suffered a loss to Stanford, the college football landscape has shaped itself in a way so that USC just needs to keep winning to reach its ultimate goal of winning a championship.
“The best way to get better is if you have game experience and sometime through game experience we are going to have to live with some mistakes,” Sarkisian said. “But that is how we should get better. And over time, we should improve as a team, and I am more than optimistic that is what we are going to see here.”
Sarkisian said that though it is easy to want to celebrate after wins, players must keep learning and building from their game experiences.
“One of the themes we’ve been really hammering is ‘sharpening our sword’ because you can come out of a game and feel like you just beat a good Arizona State team and you can relax,” Sarkisian said. “But we have to continue to sharpen our sword. It has to happen every single day in practice so that we can use the sword on gameday, and we can perform to the best of our abilities.”
Sarkisian also said that cornerback Kevon Seymour will play his first game of the season Thursday.
Defensive lineman Claude Pelon was walking in a boot during practice. He has a high ankle sprain and X-rays came back negative. Sarkisian says he will be tested significantly tomorrow.
Darreus Rodgers is a                         game-time decision. Sarkisian says that he was running today, but he will also be assessed tomorrow.

Clash of the coaches · Steve Sarkisian (above) and Chris Petersen are each in their second year of coaching at their new respective universities. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
It was not too long ago that I thought Chris Petersen might become the next head coach of USC football. Two seasons ago, when former head coach Lane Kiffin was fired after the implosion at Arizona State and Ed Orgeron’s title as interim head coach had an emphasis on the “interim,” Athletic Director Pat Haden launched a national search for someone to become the full-time head. Petersen, then the head coach at mid-major Boise State, frequently came up whenever name-brand programs were in search of someone to reestablish that brand. Of course, the Trojans’ search ended with Steve Sarkisian, then the Washington head coach, and Petersen filled the void for Sarkisian at Washington.
When Petersen and Sarkisian step into the Coliseum together on Thursday night, the sports world will get to see an interesting case study on executive leadership. The head coaches have a lot in common, so they make good partners for comparison about the future of our respective football programs. Along with their similarities are some significant and noteworthy differences.
Should the Trojans have hired Petersen over Sarkisian? Probably not, and I say that mostly because I have faith in the Athletic Department’s judgment. Additionally, the two have only completed one season at their second major head coaching destination, so time will tell if there’s any significant, long-term impact the respective coaches have on their programs. But it’s always fun to speculate, and there’s enough history these two have had in the game to have a legitimate argument about it.
When looking at the two’s resumes before the 2013 season, one is clearly more impressive in my book: Petersen.
Petersen took a                 middle-of-nowhere school into the national spotlight. The Broncos had consistently won the Western Athletic Conference before he took over in 2006, but no one could have predicted the success he would have during his eight-season tenure in Boise.
The team had two undefeated seasons, three undefeated regular seasons, three BCS bowl wins and a four-year stretch between 2008-2011 of going 50-3, the most ever wins in that span by an NCAA football team. That the College Football Playoff didn’t come into existence until after Petersen’s tenure is a national sports travesty. While the Broncos’ in-conference schedule never compared to the Power Five teams playing for the national championship, Boise State consistently had big wins early in its season over big, non-conference opponents like Virginia Tech and Oregon.
Sarkisian’s head coaching tenure was much less remarkable before coming to USC. He made a Washington program that was the absolute bottom feeder of the Pac-12 decent, but he earned the nickname “Seven-win Sark” for never taking Washington to the next level during his five-year stint. When Sarkisian was hired as the head coach at ’SC, many — including myself — wondered if his hire had more to do with his success as a Pete Carroll disciple than as a head coach himself.
So what’s happened to the two since their new gigs? Again, it’s still early to make this judgment, but the Trojans have gotten noticeably better under Sarkisian, and the Huskies have actually performed worse so far. The Huskies went from 9-4 with a bowl win in Sarkisian’s last season — technically Sarkisian had left for USC before the bowl win, but we’ll still give him some credit — to 8-6, with a bowl game loss last year. They’ve already lost both of their real tests this year in Cal and Boise State, and the road doesn’t get any easier as they move into the meat of their conference slate. They also have not generated any headlines over their recruiting class.
It’s not hard to imagine USC winning the Pac-12 South this year and going on a streak of a couple years of playing for the conference title and a de facto national playoff. There might be some long term concerns regarding the future of Oregon, and there could be a vacuum in North division for a consistent, national champion contender along with Stanford, but Petersen has yet to show any evidence of moving Washington into the direction of where his Broncos once were.
Thursday’s game still isn’t a gimme for the Trojans, but it’s probably the second easiest test besides Colorado left on the schedule of a team with arguably the nation’s toughest schedule. My instinct doesn’t say “trap game.” I still think the Trojans can afford to lose one more conference game and still win the South based off of how crazy it has been so far, but there would be some real concern from me if the Trojans dropped tomorrow’s game.
But if the Trojans do take care of business, fans should be sure to appreciate it as more than just that. It’s a reminder of how hard it is to build a program in the Pac-12. Washington had a run of success in the ’90s, including a pair of Rose Bowls and national championships, but really hasn’t amounted to anything this decade. That Sarkisian kept that team bowl-eligible for most of his tenure, but that Petersen, the guy who made blue turf look legit for a couple of seasons, can’t, should reassure our faith in our program going forward. Given the tradition and recruiting hot spot to build upon, the possibilities are endless for a Sarkisian-led program.

Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
Students of the USC Environmental Core, an organization that aims to reduce USC’s environmental impact, held a public demonstration late last month to urge USC to install a system of solar panels that would allow the University to replace 10 percent of its energy with solar power by 2020. Following the demonstration, the Environmental Core sent a comprehensive business plan to administrators that summarized its research on the idea and proposed several options for bringing solar energy to campus. Both the provost’s and the president’s offices responded, thanking the students for their hard work. However, whether USC will actually install solar panels on campus is still up in the air. Considering the financial and environmental implications of bringing solar to campus and how USC influences the development of Los Angeles, the administration should install solar panels on campus.
According to Ethan Bialick, a member of USC’s Environmental Core, installing solar panels on campus could actually be financially beneficial to USC. Some solar business models allow USC to lease unused rooftop space on campus to a solar company, which would install and maintain solar panels at no cost to the University. The energy generated by these solar panels is sent back to the city. A quote from solar company SolarCity estimated that by leasing 500,000 of square feet, USC could gain $125,000 annually, or $2,500,000 over 20 years, slightly below the average lifespan of most solar panels.
Moreover, solar power on campus brings environmental benefits. Los Angeles has historically poor air quality and regularly tops the list of Most Polluted Cities in the yearly State of the Air report conducted by the American Lung Association. By installing a solar power system, USC could curb its use of fossil fuel-based energy and, thus, reduce the city’s overall pollution and carbon dioxide emissions.
In addition, being a greener campus makes the University more attractive to college applicants. According to The Princeton Review’s 2015 College Hopes & Worries Survey Report, 60 percent of college applicants and their parents reported being “somewhat, very much or strongly” affected by “a college’s commitment to environmental issues” in their decision to “apply to or attend a school.”
Facing these convincing numbers, one might wonder why USC hasn’t already implemented solar power on campus.
“USC is a very risk-averse institution. There are potential risks from solar that they want to avoid. For instance: What if solar intensity is lower than expected? What if the solar panels stop working optimally?” said Bialick, who said he has been in several talks with USC administrators about the Environmental Core’s proposal. “When I spoke to the energy manager last time, the economics were not the problem; the problem was  the potential that something could go wrong unexpectedly.”
A reluctance to accept risk should not be the deciding factor in USC’s choice to implement solar. Yes, the University should take into account the potential failures and technical bugs that come with implementing any new technology. But as a leading research institution that claims to “[play] an increasingly important role in the development of the nation and the world.” USC needs to lead the push for solar power. USC has played a major part in the development of Southern California for over a century, and continues to impact it today. To keep in line with its mission, the University should welcome solar technology and the increased credibility, research and education opportunities that come with it.
Other colleges have already recognized the importance of leading the way to solar and have installed solar panel systems on their campuses. These schools include Stanford University; the University of California, Irvine; the University of California, San Diego and the California Institute of Technology. A case study in the Environmental Core business plan, Occidental College has supplemented a whopping 11 percent of its energy with solar power, which saves the college $250,000 annually and cuts down on carbon dioxide output by 1,250 metric tons a year. The fact that USC is not among these universities is a detriment to its reputation as a leader in the development of the region.
USC should make a decision on solar by Dec. 31, 2016, when the Solar Investment Tax Credit, a 30 percent tax credit for solar panel systems on residential and commercial properties, will expire and likely result in higher solar electricity rates. Hopefully, the administration will take heed of the research that the Environmental Core has presented and incorporate solar energy into its new sustainability plan.

At a University of California Regents meeting last month, Regent Richard Blum suggested suspension and expulsion as imperative punishments for students engaging in activities critical of Israel. He also invoked the political power of his wife, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, which many took to be a threat of negative consequences for the publicly funded university. This, as well as numerous other instances of intimidation tactics, is cited in a recent article in Salon magazine, which draws attention to the growing difficulty activists in academia have when engaging in a critical discourse about the Israel-Palestine conflict.
Silencing activists on campus is largely made possible by conflating any criticisms of Israel with inherent anti-Semitism. Though modern anti-Semitism is no myth, such conflation is an overly simplistic reduction used against campus groups to enforce violations of free speech and stifle an expression of grievances. The active squelching of Israel criticism without any legitimate grounds is antithetical to the idea of a university as a space for critical, innovative thought.
I remember my freshman year walking uncomfortably between two adjacent groups of protesters. One group was standing near the fountain on Trousdale Parkway in front of Traveler, holding the Palestinian flag and signs with the words “occupation” and “oppression”; the other group was situated in front of Tommy Trojan, holding the Israeli flag and signs strewn with the word “terrorism.” These protests occurred in November of 2012, after the Israeli Defense Forces launched Operation Pillar of Defense, which led to numerous casualties and suffering on both sides.
Student participation in either side of this protest involves more dimensions than often represented in one-sided narratives. Frequently, students who represent organizations vocally in support of Israel do so understandably by way of their Jewish heritage and identification with the idea of Israel as a safe haven for the Jewish people, who have endured so much around the world. The USC Hillel website states, “It is very important for us at Hillel that israel [sic] will not be seen in the narrow narrative of the conflict in the middle east [sic], but have our students exposed to the culture, music [and] innovative environment that Israel has to offer.” Students who vocalize support of Palestine often do so equally understandably in solidarity with the Arab, Muslim and Christian populations abroad in an increasingly complex neocolonial landscape marked by occupation and war.
These ideological sympathies are not, despite prevailing narratives, intrinsically at odds. In a preface to the 25th anniversary edition of his book Orientalism, author Edward Said indicates that “Orientalism and anti-Semitism have common roots,” and urges the “vital necessity for independent intellectuals always to provide alternative models to the reductively simplifying and confining ones, based on mutual hostility.” It would seem that universities — institutions dedicated to intellectual thought — should be the obvious default space for the development of said alternative models. But by choking out certain arguments, they instead stagnate in the camp of mutual hostility.
My position as a bystander passing between the two protests is an apt metaphor for my relation to the conflict itself. I learn and write about Israel and Palestine from abroad and have no stake — neither of identity nor more material things — in the ongoing developments. But, as a student, I do know that many of my peers on campuses across the nation will soon be leaders who make influential decisions in the future. Perpetuating a system in which one side of a conflict has the financial and political power to intimidate, silence and punish the other into submission only ensures that the most insidious aspects of our current political system will live on for many more years to come.
Any take on the developments in Israel should be formed, as Said writes of his own activism, “with full attention paid to the reality of the Jewish people and what they suffered by  way of persecution and genocide.” But suppressing any protests against Israel’s actions as a state — or declaring an academic department’s choice to participate in the BDS movement a violation of academic freedom — only entrenches a pernicious dichotomy that already tinges so much of the discourse surrounding the conflict today.

While Ms. Woodruff described herself as a “bystander” between two protesting groups, it’s quite clear her loyalty is to the type of political correctness being cultivated en masse by liberal academic elitists.
For the record, Ms. Woodruff, there’s no such nation or country called “Palestine,” and there’s no such people as “Palestinians.”  They are Islamic militants who live in disputed Israeli-owned territories, who’s goal – fully aligned with global Islam – is to rid the world of Jews, followed by everyone else who doesn’t adhere to their “religion.”
I support open borders for Israel.
HOLD ON…
What did Regent Richard Blum actually say at the meeting on 9/17/15? And what was the context? I looked it up. The main statement that has people in a tizzy is:
“Students that do the things that have been cited here today probably ought to have a dismissal or a suspension from school.”
What exactly were the things cited at the meeting?
“Vandalism and graffiti with symbols of hate, including swastikas and nooses; questioning a student’s fitness for a leadership role based on race, religion, ethnicity, gender and other factors; and depicting ethnic or racial groups as less ambitious, less talented or more threatening than others.”
This entire debate started because of some troubling incidents this year at UC schools, including the defacing of a Jewish fraternity house at UC Davis with Nazi swastikas in January. Then in February, several student government leaders at UCLA questioned a student’s eligibility for a campus judicial panel because she is Jewish. 
So the meeting was about what to do to students who commit hate crimes.
Well, I would like someone to be punished if that person commits a hate crime. I do not think punishing these hate crimes curtails free speech.
As soon as it’s about Jews, facts are no longer relevant. It’s time to bash Israel.
…And then it’s time to make a plug for the BDS movement. 
This is so twisted.
Speaking of protests:
Why is nobody protesting ISIS’ treatment of Christians’ rights? They are being killed and displaced in barbaric ways. Why is nobody protesting Iran’s treatment of political dissenters? Why is nobody upset that Cuba is blatantly arresting and torturing dissenters…in front of international journalists? (Even while Pope Francis was visiting Cuba recently). Why do people at USC and other universities not gather with signs to protest China’s treatment of their minorities, including the Tibetans and various religious groups?
Why is nobody protesting Hamas’ treatment of its own citizens? Why is nobody incensed that children are brainwashed; they are taught to hate and kill. Money and aid is diverted to build terrorist tunnels and prepare for the next war…not to improve the infrastructure or create an educational system that will prepare people for jobs. Many Muslims and Christians living in Israel want to stay in Israel because they have opportunities they would never have in other Arab countries in the area. I know. I have spoken to many of them. 
There is so much ignorance in the world about what is happening in Israel and the Middle East. There is also a concerted effort to twist the facts and prey on young, idealistic students, turning everything into an Israel hate-fest. 
If people really want to make a difference in the lives of Palestinians, then support a Palestinian land free of the hate-filled, self-destructive, oppressive rulers like Hamas. In the Palestinian National Charter, Article 15 “urges the elimination of Zionism in Palestine and worldwide, and strongly urges the ‘liberation’ of Palestine throughout by ethnic cleansing of Jewish presence.” 
If people want peace, changing that goal is, perhaps, a first step.
Bhar, you nailed it on its head.  Thanks!
I think we should help Abbas and his dear friends and allies Hamas create a Palestinian state.  Since
Hamas is more popular than Abbas let’s call it Hamasistan.  It could be based on all the other Islamist
states.  Women would have zero rights.  Gays would be hung.  Jews would be verboten.  Non-Muslims would be killed unless they convert to Islam or pay a crippling tax that is designed just for them.  
I think this makes a lot of sense and is something college punks should march for, shout about, and pretend they care about.  The world needs another Islamist state.  What will we do without another one?  
In Hamasistan criminals will be punished by being tied to the back of jeeps and skinned to death on dirt roads until they die.  The lucky criminals will simply be pushed off rooftops, and if they’re really lucky the rooftop will be very high.
In Hamasistan they will blame all their problems on Israel that way the politicians can line their Swiss Vaults with endless international aid money and not be held accountable.
In Hamasistan they will shoot rockets into Israel during rush hour and when schools get out.  That’s the way they do things in Hamasistan.  Then they will blame Israel for making them do it.  
Yes, this will solve all the problems just ask any leftist dreaming idealist – any person who has both feet firmly planted in the air – and he/she will tell you this with no uncertainty.
While millions of people worldwide are suffering real and extreme
persecution at the hands of Islamists, it is Israel, the Middle East’s only
democracy — where no one is above the law, where citizens all have equal
rights and no one is murdered for expressing his political views — that is
targeted and bullied by these so-called “human rights activists” and
academics. Deaf and blind to the real sufferers all around the world, these
Jew-haters seem in reality just brainwashed, misinformed neo-anti-Semites.
what about the Palestinian protesters? Or the illegal relocation of Palestinians in favor of Jewish settlers…please saying Israel has a clean track record is like saying the Allies in ww2 committed no war crimes.
Michael, what planet were you born on?  “War is hell” and in the heat of war crimes are committed.  You obviously have no clue as the most intense thing you’ve probably been through was a hazing at your fraternity.
But the real issue is light versus darkness.  You insinuate that the allies were not that much different than the Nazis or that the Jews are on par with the Palestinians.  In doing so you enable darkness and evil in your insane pursuit of moral equivalency.
The Allies were no different than the Nazis…learn your history, come back when you have. “probably been through was a hazing at your fraternity” nice ad hominem attack…Do you use fallacious arguments all the time or is this atypical….Love how you don’t challenge my position that the Jews illegally claim land from Palestinian families. By your “War is Hell” statement which is broad at best. Hell has no rules like the Geneva Convention…Hell has no rules like the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons which Israel is a signatory of along with those ‘great’ countries like Pakistan and India….War is Hell…Your conception of Hell is that of someone is disillusioned. Reply back when you read up on UN reports of human rights crimes by Israel. And perhaps when you read the UN report which finds credible ties between Israel and ISIS…Oh, not to mention your new buddy Putin. Sit down and be quiet. To end it…Anti-Israel arguments are important to the global scene. By arguing against Israel we can gain two things. Either a new idea can either be the new truth through its collision with error, or our current perception of truth may be clearer because of its collision with error.
Michael writes, “The Allies were no different than the Nazis…”
Wow.  Time to pinch myself and ask:  “Earth to Arafat…Come in please…Why are you even communicating with this madman???  He who would just as eagerly have embraced Nazism as the Constitution and Bill of Rights.”
Michael, your moral relativism knows no boundaries.  You do not know this – as you do not have what it takes to see yourself for what you are – but you represent the darkness.  The darkness you see as equal to light.  This is just what the Nazis did.  They rationalized themselves into a place where doing surgery on live children without pain killers was a good thing.  This is who you support with your relativistic mumbo-jumbo.
And it goes without saying that a person like you will not have the decency to apologize or admit being wrong.  Instead you will continue to blame me for not understanding the complexity of the issue.  You.  Are.  The.  Darkness.
“They rationalized themselves into a place where doing surgery on live children without pain killers was a good thing. ” with such a claim you surely have a source? Continue to set things into basic two-component with out incorporating complexity. There is no such thing as one side is light and one is darkness. Nothing is ever that simple, the narrative is never black and white. You sound delusional. I will just sit back from this and watch the world burn with people like you at the helm.
You’re right Michael, the Nazis were actually humanitarians.  {sarc/off}
You still have not denied the human rights crimes by Israel, the fact they hide Nuclear weapons and do not want a nuclear free world, they have working operations with ISIS, and allies with a Russian state far beyond reason.
Michael, is that a picture of a Nazi officer on your homepage?  That would explain everything.
The Allies prior to and during world war 2 conducting similar experiments on mentally insane and disabled peoples. Specifically the U.S. had a large Eugenic program which did experiments on mentally housed individuals. The Allies killed more French citizens than the Germans did. After Stalingrad 106,000 Germans surrendered..6,000 made it home after the war. After the war German POWs held by Western Allies were being killed off by the hundreds through a coordinated effort to starve off the soldiers and let them die by disease. They tortured hundreds of German officers and administrative workers after the war just like how the Gestapo tortured dissenters. I restate “Allies were no different than the Nazis”
You’ve convinced me and I now understand all this more clearly.
Yes, Michael, you should become a Neo-Nazi.  No question about it.
Or, better still, you should join one of the hundred plus Islamist organizations and gang-rape women, torture gays, praise Jews killers, shout out slogans about destroying America, and all those things you are so passionate about.
“But the real issue is light versus darkness” this is relative to the person. The Palestinians believe they are fighting an oppressive zionist regime(darkness) while their political, militia, and people are the light. In your own comment you commit logical fallacies by assuming your position is the moral high ground and is automatically the good side. Thus downplaying the opposing. Learn how to be objective, take a serious self-criticism of your views then please come back. “Jews are on par with the Palestinians” No the Jews are worse than the Palestinians..Who has the tanks? Jets? Drones? Highly trained soldiers? must I go on? To say that the violence done and the potential for violence are equal to that of a modern military shows you have no concept of anything related.
Michael, if you want to believe the Palestinians will bring greater women’s rights, greater gay rights, greater individual freedoms, more respect for diversity, more respect for learning than the Jews than that is OK with me.  No doubt you also believe in the tooth fairy too.
Pure and simple everything the Jews do is in reaction to what the Palestinians do.  If the Palestinians chose peace and peaceful coexistence than the Jews would not be forced to use their superior armaments.  The problem is, of course, is wherever Muslims live side-by-side with infidels, the infidels are forced to arm themselves or die instead.  This includes, of course, when Kurds, Sunnis and Shi’ites live side-by-side for Muslims cannot even coexist in peace with different sects of their religion much less with Jews.
>Jews
>Diversity
Pick one..Last time I checked I don’t remember seeing Israel receiving any refugees….or for that fact all they do is tell Europe to accept more refugees and diversity, but they lack it themselves. 
“greater gay rights” inferring I want a greater AIDS presence in my countrY’S population..No thanks.
“greater individual freedoms” than countries like Saudi Arabia and others. Yes you do. Good job. Still does not change that I dislike Israel’s horrible human rights policies. 
“more respect for diversity” –  Israel says “Hey Europe take refugees, if you don’t your against diversity and all good stuff” Europe reply – “But Israel why don’t you take any” Jew -> “Oh, no, All the Muslims want us dead” Spare me your we respect diversity bullshit.
Given that you support the Palestinians who openly advocate Jewish genocide (see their duly elected leaders clear-cut party covenants), you correspondingly do as well. It’s hard to believe in this day and age that anyone would openly advocate the liquidation of Jews, but you clearly do and it doesn’t seem to bother you a whit.
Moreover, it would be hard to believe that anyone would support second class status for women, the honor murder of teenage girls, the brutalization of gays and the suppression of dissenters. But you, as supporters of the Palestinians who regularly practice all of the above, are therefore complicit in these sexist, racist and fascist beliefs as well.
Why are you so bigoted, misogynist, anti-gay and such hater of Jews? Please tell us pray tell.
And if to be opposed to such garbage practiced by so many Muslims world-wide makes one an Islamophobe, count me and all who believe in freedom and hate sexism and bigotry vs Jews as a proud Islamophobe.
Nice to include Edward Said quotes. And, yes, stifling free speech (that’s not A direct cause for damage or loss of life I.e yelling ‘fire’ in a theater) at universities is absurd.
Especially absurd that senator Feinstein and her UC chancellor uber-Zionist husband would put the concerns of Israelis over those of American taxpayers/citizens……………..
Not liking the part about the 2012 Gaza War where ‘ casualties and suffering on both sides’….
Really?
I guess 1000 dead Palestinian civilians is equivalent to 1 dead Israeli soldier 500 Israelis who wet their pants from being scared from unguided bottle rockets that rarely hit anything more than an open field
read the trial where Justice Homes said “Fire” in a crowded theater is an example of when freedom of speech should be limited…that case was thrown out as fallacious and the ruling and new definition of restriction it made were thrown out long since. Look up the trial and see what it was about. Doubt you will have the same feelings toward such an overrated quote as Homes gave.

The USC College Republicans are at it again, bringing a politically controversial speaker to campus on Wednesday while maintaining that other student organizations should stay away from politics. A mere eight days after the club shared a Daily Trojan letter to the editor with the comment “student dollars should never be spent on partisan politics,” the club is hosting Milo Yiannopoulos, noting in their description of the event that the speaker has been called a “rising star of the Right.” This club has some gall to give overtly political speakers a platform at USC while admonishing student groups for being even tangentially involved in politics.
In the letter to the Daily Trojan, author Giuseppe Robalino seems to argue that the Women’s Student Assembly is engaging in “divisive politics” by establishing relations with a California union that has encouraged lawmakers to support legislation that helps workers. Because the WSA gets funding from USC, Robalino says they are unethically dragging USC students into politics, even though no WSA funds ever went to the union in question. USC College Republicans applauded the author and the letter.
On the same page, the club  also encourages students to attend the upcoming talk with the political commentator Yiannopolous. The idea that student groups should not be political while encouraging students to see a political speaker hosted by a political student group is incongruous.
This is not the first time USC College Republicans has been caught speaking one way but acting another. Last spring, USC hosted civil rights activist Angela Davis for a talk on race and inclusivity.
As columnist Nathaniel Haas pointed out in the Daily Trojan at the time, the College Republicans posted on its Facebook page that Davis “has no place on our campus and should have never been invited to speak” and “shame on the groups responsible for bringing murderer communist Angela Davis to USC tonight.” Haas noted, “The College Republicans hosted Ann Coulter on campus two years ago, a speaker whose bigotry toward race, the Muslim religion and sexual orientation is well known. Viewed in the most positive light, their statements about Davis are blatantly hypocritical.” Just like this past spring, the College Republicans cannot resist telling others how to conduct their programming while ignoring its own advice.
Whatever an individual might believe about Coulter, Davis or Yiannopolous, the three can only appear on campus to speak to students because students, student groups and the University support the events. Student tuition dollars pay for the infrastructure that gives speakers lecture halls, podiums and microphones, as well as sometimes paying speakers’ appearance fees. Student groups find speakers who will educate their members and members of the Trojan Family and invite the speakers to campus. The University lends its name and credibility to the events and coordinates these efforts with administrators to oversee the process. In getting speakers to come to campus, all members of the Trojan Family play a role.
The College Republicans is being intellectually dishonest; it is applying a strict standard to other groups without applying the same scrutiny to themselves. The club should either believe that student groups should stay out of politics and cancel tonight’s event, or should accept that student groups can and should interact with all sorts of speakers. If the club cannot accept that other opinions exist on campus, it should disband in its current form and dissociate the club from USC entirely.
USC College Republicans can only exist with University and student support. USC allows the club to exist, allows the club to use the name “University of Southern California,” gives the club meeting space in University buildings, invites the club to participate at involvement fairs on Trousdale Parkway and helps bring speakers to campus.
Whatever USC College Republicans may say in the future about the ways in which it pays speaking fees — as it did this spring, when discussing Coulter’s appearance — it could not bring speakers like Coulter or Yiannopoulos to campus without USC’s support, which is paid for by tuition dollars. Certainly, the club could disband and reform as the “Los Angeles Republicans Who Are Also College Students Club,” but then they would not have the institutional support necessary to bring big-name speakers to their events. Because it exists as part of USC, it needs to recognize and accept the value that the University provides to all students who want to hear speakers on campus.
It would be tragic if USC began restricting speakers based on their political views. For the good of all Trojans, the USC College Republicans should reconsider their position on student political activism.
Isn’t there a strict difference between USC College Republicans and the WSA because WSA is a part of the student government, whilst USC College Republicans is a club?
maybe the WSA should be separated from the student government because, after all, it’s a “woman’s group” –it should be relegated to club status–student body governmental structure of a college.   college republicans on the other hand should be part of the student government because it deals with politics and government.   WSA is nothing more than a gestapo group which do nothing than crying and whining, screaming “rape” and “trigger warnings” until they get their way.
I’m not sure if I should be entertained or disappointed by all the tin can throwing going on between the two political organizations at this university. The rabble I see regularly on this newspaper is no different from what I see on TV. Blame games, name calling, rhetoric, how about working together for once? Nah, forget it, the other side is full of dumb heads!

I sit down in my three-hour lab section, and, without fail, my stomach starts to grumble. The worst thing about having back-to-back classes isn’t, as I thought, speed-walking frantically from Kaprelian to VKC in 10 minutes while dodging bikers and skateboarders. It’s the non-stop chit chat from my stomach when the clock strikes 6 p.m. For those of us that have class during our usual lunch and dinner times, the best way to cure “hangriness” is to pack a good snack.
Make use of your freebie water bottle collection and grab some almond milk from CVS. Almond milk is light but filling. Unlike regular milk, it does not have to be refrigerated yet is still rich in vitamins and calcium. For you sugar-conscious Trojans, many brands of almond milk come in unsweetened flavors. Instead of reaching for Gatorade or Coke, almond milk with added ice is the perfect energy drink to get you through your late night classes. Almond milk has a longer shelf life than dairy milk, so buy in bulk to save on this drink. 
Have extra dining dollars? Stop by Seeds before class and pick up fruit crisps or chips. Portable yet packed with nutrients and natural sweeteners, fruit-based snacks like apple chips will satisfy your cravings with a little extra crunch. As with almond milk, cut the price tag in half by buying in bulk or ordering directly from the supplier.
While there are a lot of snack bars on the market, it is important to choose wisely. Many “healthy” bars are loaded with sugar and high fructose corn syrup, keeping you awake just long enough to crash harder. Avoid protein bars, which are often coated with chocolate, and opt instead for nut bars. Almonds and pecans are high in “good” fats and make you feel full. 
If you are looking for protein-rich snacks, but want to avoid the sugar, try string cheese. A good on-the-go option, individually packaged cheese is easy to scarf down between classes and, like nuts, is rich in good fats. Some types of cheese come in “raw” forms, including certain varieties of Colby and Cheddar, which also have probiotics.
Packing a healthy snack for a long day of classes can give any overstretched student just the right boost, and by planning ahead, trendy foods like almond milk and fruit crisps can add variety to your snacking without breaking the bank.
