Following a record tying performance against Syracuse, USC quarterback Matt Barkley was named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week. Barkley threw five touchdown passes to lead the Trojans to a 38-17 victory over the Orange.
Barkley’s performance Saturday is the third time in his career at USC in which he tied the passing record of five touchdowns. He had previously done so last year against Hawaii and California in his second season as the team’s starting quarterback. Barkley shares the prestigious record along side former Trojans Rodney Peete, Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart and Mark Sanchez.
Against Syracuse, Barkley completed 67 percent of his passes. Thus, completing 26-of-39 passes for 324 yards. With his accomplishment, Barkley has moved into fifth place for career total offense at USC with 6,376 yards. Over the course of his last 27 games, he has thrown at least one touchdown 23 times. This season, Barkley is 80-of-116 for 892 yards, nine touchdowns and one interception.
Barkley is joined by two other standout players from the Pac-12. Utah defensive end Trevor Reilly and California kick returner Brendan Bigelow have also been named to the Bank of the West Pac-12 Players of the Week.

In June 2010, the Pac-10 added Colorado and Utah to expand to 12 teams. Though the conference is only in its first year of play with that number, it could be adding more institutions in the near future.
For months, rumors have swirled concerning various conference expansion options.
Though several scenarios are currently being discussed, the most likely for the Pac-12, according to multiple reports, appears to be adding Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas and Texas Tech to create a 16-team conference. As of right now, it is unclear how the divisions would shape up.
“It is my opinion that the case for the Big 12 Conference continues to be as strong today for all of our current members as it was last year, especially considering the welfare of those to whom we owe the greatest responsibility — the student-athletes,” Big 12 commissioner Dan Beebe said in a statement. “We continue to apply all effort and resources toward assuring our members that maintaining the Big 12 is in the best interest for their institutions.”
Regents from both Oklahoma and Texas met Monday to discuss conference realignment, where they cleared their respective schools to leave the Big 12 conference and explore other options.
“Beyond the Big 12, the principal focus for us is the Pac-12,” Oklahoma President David Boren told John Hoover of the Tulsa World on Wednesday.
Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott has remained adamant, however, that the conference is not actively looking to expand.
“We don’t plan to expand,” Scott told the Daily Trojan before USC’s conference opener against Utah on Sept. 10. “What’s changed is what’s going on with the Big 12.”
Expansion is not imminent, though, as there are still issues to be worked out.
Primarily, Texas’s current contractual obligations to the Longhorn Network, which was launched in August, could complicate any scenario in which Texas leaves for the Pac-12.
Currently, the network earns approximately $11 million per year, and the extra revenue generated is likely to be a point of contention with current Pac-12 schools, which have adopted equal revenue sharing under the conference’s new TV deal beginning in 2012. Because of these complications, it is possible the Pac-12 would only add the Oklahoma schools.
Over the weekend, a huge domino in the college expansion game fell, when the Atlantic Coast Conference announced Sunday the additions of Pittsburgh and Syracuse, formerly of the Big East, becoming the first 14-team football conference when the two schools begin play.
In the Big 12, Texas A&M is reportedly leaving the conference for the Southeastern Conference, which would reduce the number of member institutions to nine — threatening the viability of the league.
As a result, the rest of the members are searching for a soft landing spot should the conference collapse.
Last week, TCU Athletic Director Chris Del Conte, whose school will be heading to the Big East next year, commented on the situation.
“There are earthquakes going on all around us,” he told ESPN’s Joe Schad. “And we don’t know when they’ll settle.”
I am more interested in USC’s view on this matter. It’s a good report, but I feel something is missing.
Also, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott keeps on saying “we don’t plan to expand”, but why?
Take OU and OSU if its in ‘our” best PAC 12 interest but not Texas. They screwed their own conference members in a network deal excluding everyone but themselves… thats just bad business for conference member.  I beleive this is the reason their conference is collapsing now.
 PAC 12  equal revenue sharing  per school via Larry Scott doesn’t do this as you have already stated and all schools will have the ability to improve especially schools like Wazzu. I commend Mr Scott for his vision.
Moreover, Texas has a unrepended racist background which I don’t think is a good fit for our part of the country and group of great schools, teams, and players.
“One” case in point is the name of the their stadium presently “Darrell K Royal Stadium”  named after one of their “still Living” most cherished all time coaches. Coach Royal  spoke and enforced racist  filth during his tenure at Texas regarding “black” players for which he has never apologized for publicly,  yet present day Texas fans, Alumni, and school president Bill Powers not only allow his name to remain on their stadium proudly, but throw university related birthday parties for Mr. Royal every August. .. You can fast track some knowledge on this by watching the movie ” The Express” to see some of  Texas proud CFB history.
Even though Texas fans may argue that all America was like this in those days and that was CFB back then, this does not explain the Pedestal  and honor they secretly chose to elevate those exact SAME living people TODAY.  It does not appear that Darrell Royal is the only thing still secretly  believed in at Texas. Actions are louder than words friends.
Perhaps The SEC or independent  is a better fit for them ( also note to Texas fans that OU has way better CFB record and history then you ever had so we are not avoiding playing great CFB teams, just you)

The sophomore slump is as much a part of sports as hot dogs and cheerleaders.
The term means exactly what it says — a player, in his second year, fails to come close to living up to the enormous expectations placed on him after the success of his rookie season.
Sophomore slumps are fairly common, partly because opposing teams now know exactly what to expect and how to prepare for it, and partly because the players themselves cannot seem to maintain the levels of confidence they had the year before.
But after a breakout freshman season in which he posted 792 yards receiving and six touchdowns on 65 receptions, sophomore receiver Robert Woods seems to ignore this phenomenon altogether.
The wideout has taken his game to new levels, and hasn’t hesitated a moment to prove it. In the first game of the season alone, Woods had a record-setting 17 catches, torching Minnesota for 177 yards and three touchdowns.
In that one game, Woods matched almost a quarter of his receptions and yards, and half of his touchdowns from the entire 2010 season.
Since then, the sophomore has had two straight games of eight receptions each, totaling 184 yards and a touchdown.
Woods is on pace to reel in 132 passes for 1,444 yards and 16 touchdowns in 2011, which is enough to shatter the single-season records in receptions and yards.
He’s just the latest in a long line of star wideouts to start their legacies at USC, but Woods seems to have a step up on even those pass-catchers immortalized in Heritage Hall.
A simple glance at the sophomore isn’t enough to reveal why exactly this is — as a 6-foot-1, 180-pounder, Woods isn’t exactly Dwayne Jarret-esque. In fact, he’s one of the smaller guys on the team.
So what makes Woods so good?
You could point to his rapport with junior quarterback Matt Barkley. Barkley has already spoken of the “telepathic” connection the two share when on the field, and you’d be hard-pressed to find an instance of miscommunication so far this year.
It is no coincidence Barkley targets Woods more often than any of his other receivers and has completed more than 80 percent of his passes when doing so.
One could argue that his fundamentals — crisp route running, the fact that he uses his hands and not his body to catch passes — can also be credited for his blossoming success.
Woods is able to exploit even the smallest advantages he has over a defense and turn them into major gains for the Trojans.
Though these attributes have bolstered his skyrocketing numbers, they take a backseat to the true reason for Woods’ meteoric rise: his focus.
Woods is 19 years old, and yet he has put himself in a position to be successful from the start of his career.
In a season where the Trojans have seen their share of off-field incidents and academic ineligibilities, the kid who is still getting used to seeing R-rated movies in theaters has managed to become the role model most veterans hope to become.
Woods has made it look easy to fill the shoes of the great receivers before him, but it wouldn’t be possible without his ability to stay on track and ensure his continued development as a football player. With the common story in sports today centering on the wasted potential of athletes for one reason or another, he makes for a refreshing case study.
Though there is a lot more football to be played and a lot left to prove, Woods has made it clear he doesn’t intend on letting up anytime this season. The sophomore’s talent and fundamentals are unparalleled, and his work ethic will ensure he stays at the top of his game.
But more than anything, Woods is simply just too focused to be bothered, especially with something as ridiculous as a sophomore slump.

The USC women’s volleyball team has a habit of stacking up wins to start the season.
Juggling act · USC coach Mick Haley has been forced to make several lineup changes following injuries and the ineligibility of Falyn Fonoimoana. - Daily Trojan file photo
Before this year, the No. 12 Women of Troy (7-3, 2-1) hadn’t lost more than two of their first 10 matches since 2005, when they started 4-6 before recovering to reach the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
Much of the same was expected this year after reaching the Final Four last season, landing USC the No. 2 spot in the preseason poll behind three returning All-Americans and a top-10 recruiting class.
But after sophomore outside hitter and reigning Pac-10 Freshman of the Year Falyn Fonoimoana was declared ineligible on the eve of the season, the Women of Troy sputtered out of the gate, losing two of their first three matches, including an embarrassing 3-0 sweep at the hands of unranked Central Florida.
They won their next four matches before their home opener against then-No. 8 UCLA, which was heavily promoted by USC’s marketing department in an attempt to set an attendance record for a volleyball match at the Galen Center.
The record was set, but the 5,385 spectators witnessed the home team fall to the rival Bruins in a 3-0 sweep.
“I think we were in a funk before we ever walked in the gym, and we couldn’t get them focused properly,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “And sometimes when that happens, you try too hard when you have a crowd like that.”
The Women of Troy rebounded last weekend, however, by sweeping Washington and Washington State on the road, but their expectations have definitely been tempered since first receiving that lofty preseason ranking — the team was ranked No. 12 in the poll released Monday.
Some of those early-season struggles can be attributed to injuries sustained by sophomore middle blocker Alexis Olgard and junior middle blocker Natasa Siljkovic, players expected to compete for the starting middle blocker spot.
In their absence, freshman Hannah Schraer has been forced into the starting lineup.
Haley praised the play of Schraer, who was not expected to receive much playing time this season, but admitted, “Hannah isn’t as good as a blocker as [Olgard] is.”
Olgard and Siljkovic are expected to return to the rotation soon, but one player USC will miss for the entire season is Fonoimoana.
Fonoimoana started in 31 of 34 matches last year, and was second on the team in kills (3.34 kills per save) and points (3.93 points per save) en route to winning Pac-10 Freshman of the Year honors.
Fonoimoana was expected to be a key contributor for the Women of Troy, but just one week before the team’s first match, it was announced she was ineligible for the 2011 season.
“[The personnel losses] have affected our ability to defend,” Haley said. “We’re just having trouble defending our opponent’s counter-attack, and that starts at the net with our blocking … And Falyn is [listed at 6-foot-4], so she takes up a lot of area up there.”
Haley also pointed to the left side of the team’s counter-attack as an area in need of improvement.
Sophomore outside hitter/opposite Kirby Burnham had been starting as left outside hitter before the team’s trip to the Washington schools, before Haley decided to insert sophomore Sara Shaw in her place.
The move seemed to spark the team’s offense, as Shaw set a career-high of 15 kills in USC’s victory over No. 4 Washington, and added 11 digs to record the double-double.
Haley hopes he has found the winning lineup for the Women of Troy; they’ll endure arguably the toughest two-game stretch of their schedule this weekend when No. 1 California (13-0, 3-0) and No. 2 Stanford (8-1, 2-1) come into town.
“[The schedule] has just worked out that way,” Haley said. “It’s very challenging, but we want to beat those teams at the end of the year, so playing them early gives us a good benchmark to know what to do if we play them later.”
Haley is encouraged by his players perseverance in practice despite the disappointing losses, and is confident the team will be back to its winning ways soon enough.
“We win 80 percent of the time here [at USC], and when we don’t do that, it’s upsetting,” Haley said. “If we weren’t getting good effort in practice, I would be more concerned than I am right now. If I can get this kind of effort every day for the next two months, we’ll be very good [at the end of the season].”

Beginning the season with much attention and great anticipation, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team has surpassed all expectations — at least thus far.
Clutch · Senior driver Peter Kurzeka, pictured here during a nonconference clash with UC Santa Barbara last season, has led an impressive array of Trojan attackers with 13 goals in 2011, including three during last weekend’s NorCal tournament. - Daily Trojan file photo
The Trojans (5-0) remain undefeated even after last weekend’s NorCal tournament in Stockton, Calif., which pitted them against some of the toughest teams in the country.
USC upended No. 4 Stanford, No. 6 UC Irvine and No. 3 UCLA en route to becoming two-time defending champions of the prestigious early-season tournament.
“We played all of our players that traveled, which was 19 players,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “And every single player contributed in a positive way. It was really a team-orientated tournament. We didn’t have any major lapses. Overall, I was very impressed.”
On Sunday night, USC broke open an early 2-2 deadlock in the first quarter against UCLA with three consecutive goals — two from freshman driver Kosta Genidounias and one from sophomore driver Nikola Vavic.
By halftime, after yet another Genidounias goal, the score was 6-4 in favor of the Trojans.
Armed with a 10-7 lead with more than three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, USC managed to stave off a late UCLA surge to secure the 10-8 victory and repeat as champions.
“This really was a complete team effort,” Vavic said. “[Redshirt junior two-meter Brian] Boswell played really well. There were a lot of people who needed to step in and play because [senior two-meter] Matt Burton, our best defender, did not play in this tournament. The players that really gave us a boost when he didn’t play were [sophomore two-meter] Connor Virjee and [redshirt freshman two-meter] Jack Plaga.”
In the process, senior goalie Joel Dennerley notched 19 saves against UCLA to break USC’s all-time record of 692 saves.
“Joel broke our record in blocks and he was absolutely on fire,” Vavic said. “He really stepped up when we needed him.”
Against No. 4 Stanford in the semifinals earlier Sunday afternoon, USC jumped out to a commanding 4-0 lead after the first quarter and ballooned the lead to 10-3 at halftime, effectively punching its ticket to the final match before the second half began.
The weekend started with a Friday morning match against West Valley Junior College, a team added to the NorCal Tournament at the last moment to reach a complete 16-team field.
West Valley only trailed 4-2 at the end of the first quarter, but could not muster a game plan to neutralize the Trojans, as USC proceeded to outscore West Valley 16-1 over the remainder of the match for a final victory of 20-3.
On Saturday, USC endured a sluggish start against No. 6 UC Irvine, with both teams knotted at 2-2 at halftime.
Once play resumed, however, the Trojans, on the strength of nine different scorers, exploded for nine goals in the second half while only surrendering two, delivering an 11-4 victory.
Despite the well-rounded effort throughout the tournament, one position player stood out to Vavic.
Genidounias tallied 12 goals in four games, including five in the final match against UCLA.
“[His performance] was definitely a surprise,” Vavic said. “I knew he was an excellent player, but I have many good players play for us and not perform like this in the very first tournament.”
Though USC comes away with another tournament title, the coaching staff insists its focus is now on the next match and the team must be prepared for every team’s best shot.
“We try to focus on the game, and we have Irvine coming up this Saturday,” Vavic said. “We knew at the beginning of the season that we would be a team to beat. It’s not a secret that we are the favorite to win at the NCAAs. We know what our goal is, and we are trying to do something that has never been done. It’s not going to be easy but we are enjoying this road.”

Sometimes exploring the darker side of life makes for the best art. The most frightening, shocking pieces of art are often the most passionate and technically daring. In creating images that could very well scare audiences, artists push their art to delve into psychological layers that peaceful and idyllic art leaves alone. In other words, the darker the art, the trippier the experience.
Kraken was no doubt aware of this when he created the works in his current exhibition, at Hold Up Art, entitled “Fantasmas,” a collection of everything from posters to four-color silkscreen prints. Somehow, in his renditions of thrillingly creepy figures, Kraken makes even the most nightmarish of images stunning. Taking inspiration from things such as movies and serial killer case studies, Kraken leads viewers into a world full of intriguingly attractive but horrifying figures.
About half of the exhibition focuses on the music posters that Kraken created, showcasing his graphic design talent. And while his talent is evident, it was the less-manufactured, more creatively-free figures that came from the depths of Kraken’s imagination that sent a thrilling fear and awe into viewers’ minds.

Focusing on female figures, Kraken gives his audience everything from a pupil-less but beautiful woman surrounded by vines and her own wild, gorgeous hair to a woman who has roses for eyes. Kraken takes many images we typically associate with beauty and turns them topsy-turvy.
“Olvido,” the figure with roses as eyes, could be beautiful with such a classic flower for features, but when you look closely there is blood dripping down her cheeks. It might not be the most inviting image to unprepared viewers but Kraken’s skillful attention to detail is undeniable.
In each frightening image there is layer upon layer of detail. The figure in the forefront immediately grabs the viewer’s attention, but the many details in the background call attention to Kraken’s talent for mixing patterns and bold colors.
It’s easy to throw together various colors to make an image pop, but a true testament to artistry is one’s ability to stick to a simple color palette and still create a compelling image. Kraken expertly chooses a few colors for his figures to make them pop.
Taking a closer look, you will see his play with shadow, going beyond the basic technique of choosing which spots to make darker. “Redemption Queen,” a complex silkscreen piece, uses lines to create shadows, defining the shape of the figure’s neck with a conglomeration of lines traveling in all directions. The figure’s transfixing blue hair looks realistic because of the expert placement of black lines. But as with all his female figures, Kraken seems to warn us there is something more complex about this figure with her Byzantine art-style halo and arresting stare.
Religion is a common theme in the pieces, with Kraken adapting the image of Jesus to his elusive, sometimes frightening female figures. It’s a gutsy move, and Kraken’s affinity for halos, blood and frightening eyes makes the piece anything but easy to look at, regardless of your religious affiliation.
But the works don’t seem like a cheap attempt to break down any religious beliefs. Kraken places more emphasis on delving into the darker side of the human psyche and presents images that force viewers to do more than gaze in passivity.
For being his first independent show and including only a few pieces, the exhibition showcases Kraken’s evident talent for mixing drama, emotion and movement into an explosive aesthetic style. The more the viewer stares, the more details reveal themselves, which is a good tenet for any art, no matter the subject or style.
Kraken’s pieces can be controversial, thrilling, frightening and perplexing, but quality art will always perplex its viewers into a state of curiosity that keeps them coming back for more. From his more graphic design related works to his complex female figures, it seems this is just the start of Kraken’s developing, yet exciting style.
Great artist!  Congratulations
I am a proud owner of a Kraken’s piece. I love it, is unique, creative and beautiful. Kraken is a young revelation than I am sure will be a sucessful artist!

Though the band Bush fits into a wider alternative rock style and has experimented with numerous styles — such as electronic, metal and even gentler sounds — the band was never able to escape the initial grunge label it received for Sixteen Stone, and as a result, broke up last decade.
Now reunited — though with only half of the original Sixteen Stone lineup — the band released its first album in a decade, The Sea of Memories.
Thankfully, the record is more than just a rehashing of popular songs or a poor attempt to reclaim the old sound. Instead, The Sea of Memories shows Bush has grown artistically, but still has that creative spark that made its previous albums so strong.
The album opens with “The Mirror of the Signs,” a perfect representation of the new release. It’s a guitar-driven rocker that puts listeners right into the mix. The chorus picks up the energy, but the song flows right into it, with a natural progression rather than a sharp contrast.
The following track, “The Sound of Winter,” feels like a more traditional Bush song, with existential, allusion-heavy lyrics, backed by heavy percussion as seen with a melodic undercurrent provided by guitarist Chris Traynor.
There is something to be said for the lack of Nigel Pulsford, the band’s other creative force in its earlier days, and his aggressive guitar playing. All of the music on the album feels more nuanced, however, there are more layers to each track, and instead of simple pounding chords that drive songs forward, there’s just enough experimentation to make them more complex.
This isn’t an experimental album — there’s a clear thematic and musical focus — but it exists because of the experimentation and fine tuning the band is known for.
Gavin Rossdale’s talent as a vocalist and lyricist is showcased brilliantly. Unlike his recent solo album, which suffered from overproduction and a subdued vocal approach, The Sea of Memories lets him embrace his range and raw style. In “Stand Up,” he transforms his singing in the chorus to a smoother flow, while never making it seem at odds with the verses where he uses his more raw approach.
Rossdale still has his stream-of-consciousness, highly evocative wordplay, but like the instrumentation, it feels wizened. Throughout the tracks, Rossdale weaves in motifs of the sea and repetitions to take care of oneself and leave life’s problems behind, most prominently in “All My Life,” “The Afterlife” and then in the final track, “Be Still My Love.”
Bush also proves it can still craft good ballads. The fifth track, “All Night Doctors,” is a piano-driven, tender love song that picks up more instruments as it goes on, putting more emotional weight behind Rossdale’s singing. The gradual build from a quiet musing on love to a plea for passion is handled perfectly.
But that’s not to say Bush doesn’t rock, either. “Afterlife” and “Stand Up” are two fast-paced, rolling jams: the kind of alternative rock that melds energy with a more contemporary, melodic flow. Bush shows in The Sea of Memories that it’s good at ingeniously balancing the mix of hard rock and softer songs. What normally shouldn’t work — like the transition from “Afterlife” to “All Night Doctors” — instead keeps with the album’s natural progression.
The Sea of Memories isn’t perfect, however. “She’s a Stallion,” what seems set up to be the album’s most energetic song, falls completely flat in its execution. Despite a strong, guitar-focused opening, the song falls victim to uneven pacing. It’s strange to find so distinct a dud, especially since it’s placed between the rhythmic “Red Light” and the effective rock song “I Believe in You.”
With the closing song, “Be Still My Love,” Bush wraps up the album on a tender, tragic note. Bringing in the album’s many motifs and putting them into the most romantic lyrics on an album, focused on love and existentialism, Rossdale finds the right energy balance, ending not on a whimper or a bang but rather a mournful goodbye.
Beyond one complete flop of a song, The Sea of Memories is a very cohesive, strong album. It’s clear the band has grown lyrically and musically. The Sea of Memories not only brings Bush back, but shows that eight years after the split, Rossdale and company still have it.

Jutted at the end of Astronaut E.S. Onizuka Street and San Pedro Street, Café Demitasse seems like any other posh, modern coffee shop in Little Tokyo.
Overseas invention · Café Demitasse’s famous Kyoto slow-dripping coffee maker requires an 18-hour wait to sculpt an unlikely flavor that is clean and robust yet fragrantly sweet. The gourmet coffees are crafted with care, and taste as delicate and prestigious as fine wines. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
The first thing you see upon entering are two sets of long glass and bronze contraptions that look straight out of an 18th century science laboratory. They’re in fact special Japanese slow-dripping coffee makers that require at least 18 hours to extract a dark, smooth, chocolate-like concoction called Kyoto coffee.
The small cafe, opened by former lawyer and USC alumnus Bobak Roshan in late August, is not another Starbucks wannabe or cute-themed Asian cafe. Café Demitasse loves its coffee and takes it very, very seriously.
Unlike cafes such as Intelligentsia, which has earned a feverish fan base, Café Demitasse is stripped of all the avant-garde egoism of the new artisanal coffee places. It might showcase lots of fancy coffee-making gadgets and sleek interior design, but owner Roshan’s mission for his cafe is simple: He just wants to serve the perfect cup of joe.
Café Demitasse buys from San Rafael-based Equator Coffees and Teas and a rotating guest selection from Los Angeles-based coffee roasters. Accordingly, the menu is simple and limited; every hot beverage is ground and brewed to order, either in a siphon filter or a Clever full-immersion coffee dripper.
If you order the siphon-style coffee, make sure to sit at the Aroma Bar, a mini counter where you can see, smell and hear the ball-shaped glass carafe (also called vacpot) of water steaming over halogen light bulbs.
The 18-hour slow-dripped Kyoto iced coffee is made ahead of time, for obvious reasons, and is served in a sake bottle that separates ice cubes from coffee so the coffee is preserved as iced coffee instead of melting into coffee with extra water.
The flavor is unlike any iced coffee you can get at a commercial coffee shop. Clean and robust yet fragrantly sweet, the Kyoto iced coffee is like the bitter liquid extract of high-quality dark chocolate. If cacao beans could ever be pressed into wine, it would taste like this.
The coffees here are given the same thought and care as a good wine tasting bar. Café Demitasse recommends pairing different coffee with specific desserts. The floral tones of Tanzania Peaberry Kanyovu brewed in a siphon filter, for example, are accentuated with a Jasmine tea truffle from Compartes Chocolatier. Meanwhile, the smokiness and darkness of El Salvador Finca El Salaverria coffee becomes more pronounced with a Cardamom Pear truffle.
All desserts are purveyed from small Los Angeles-based businesses like Santa Monica’s Farmshop, Venice’s Jin Patisserie and Batch from Scratch bakery, operated by former Masterchef contestant Esther Kang.
Like a lab, Café Demitasse is always experimenting with new coffee beans, desserts and beverages. It offers seasonal menus; the current summer menu features interesting cold drinks like iced mint Cubano (an energizing mix of fresh mint, espresso and milk sweetened slightly with Demerara sugar) and iced shiso green tea (a refreshing, unsweetened blend of vibrant shiso leaves and lemon-ginseng green tea).
The cafe is currently working to perfect the lavender hot chocolate — a thick, intense blend of cocoa, steamed milk and lavender extract that tastes like melted-down lavender truffle. The drink is not yet on the menu, but the baristas will whip one up upon request.
Café Demitasse makes every drink to go as well, but take the time to sit down and relax. It’s more than a grab-and-go shop; it also doubles as a lounge where you can sit for hours and chat with baristas, or as a comfortable study room where you can take advantage of the free Wi-Fi without all the usual background noise of blenders and loud music. Plus, the mugs they serve their coffee and teas in are funky and cool.
It might just be coffee, but at Café Demitasse, the humble cup of java takes on multiple dimensions. It’s no longer just a beverage, but a unique experience of delicious and wonderful senses. Here, coffee buzzes you in more ways than just caffeine can.
Thanks for the recommendation. Sounds like quite an interesting and unique shop. We’ll definitely check it out
I’d recommend another coffee shop in the area along with this cafe.  In the Japanese VIllage Plaza, there’s a new cafe called Cafe Dulce that does a similar 18 hour cold process brew for the iced coffee as well.  Their coffee is just as delicious as Demitasse, if not better, and their pastries are creative and tasty as well.
I am going to respectfully disagree with you about Cafe Dulce having better coffee.  While it is a delightful place, their focus is set on pastries and their coffee is regular at best.  Demitasse makes a great effort to place coffee at the forefront and they do quite a humble job, despite the flashy coffee gear.
Blake, to each their own, but I will have to disagree with you.  I have seen the baristas in action at both places.  The cappucinos at Dulce seem to be closer to the right temperature than the ones at Demitasse, which seemed to be too hot.  Also, the latte art at Dulce (although I’m not sure how important that is when it comes to the customer’s viewpoint) seemed to be clearer and even.  Just my two cents.
The overall quality of the coffee and experience is just top notch at Demitasse and they’ve only been open for about a month.  This will be the De facto specialty coffee bar in the area, the owner has put a lot of heart into the place and people are noticing.  Both places are unique in their own respect, but Demitasse’s presentation and quality really do exceed this coffee geek’s expectations.
“de facto”..you sound like a lawyer..o.O
This coffee shop sounds delightful, with its unique attitude towards coffee and the various blends it’s providing for its discerning clientele.  I can easily imagine it would be a lovely place to relax and enjoy an exceptionally good coffee.

One of the main goals with any fitness plan, no matter the combination of diet and exercise, should be to maximize the body’s physical potential. That means making it stronger, more flexible and more agile. In many cases, this requires a number of different workout routines. Most sports prepare the body for specialization, not overall fitness — except one: Parkour.
In the words of Cliff Kravit, instructor at the L.A. School of Gymnastics, “[Parkour is] the art of overcoming obstacles.” It is not, despite what The Office’s Michael Scott might think, an endless display of flips and spins with no real outcome. The essential idea is to get from point A to point B as directly and effectively as possible, using all the muscles in the body. Tricks can be incorporated, but at its heart, parkour is a minimalist discipline designed for effectiveness.
The core ideas of parkour are efficiency and constant progress. This applies to overcoming obstacles — do only what you can do, and the most effective move, while maintaining the momentum — and practicing the discipline. This isn’t a sport designed to burn out the body or to cause injury.
But what makes it so great is its functionality for exercise. It truly does work the entire body. Depending on the obstacles, any parkour outing can involve running, jumping, vaulting or climbing walls, balancing across rails and other activities. In essence, imagine a combination of cardio, plyometrics, pulling moves such as pull-ups and any sort of workout designed to increase flexibility.
And most of all, parkour’s roots are urban; the rails, walls, benches, hills and other obstacles often involved are found in cities, not suburbs or farms. And in a city like Los Angeles, these challenges abound. Plus, learning to get around quickly on foot can be an incredibly useful skill.
Colleges like USC are great for parkour.
We’ve all run late to class, having to weave through crowded streets on campus to a building. Any chance to get around a small wall and out of the slow-moving crowd helps.
Parkour is a discipline based entirely on situation, personal decision and environment. There isn’t a set of routines to do that solves every obstacle or problem. After taking a few training sessions, however, it was clear there are a few core concepts that are heavily utilized. Learning to absorb impact when landing, whether from jumping down from a wall or elsewhere, is key; land on the balls of your feet, bending the knees and body to avoid injury. It’s harder than it sounds, but when mastered, it’s incredibly fun and safe too.
Other common concepts are rolls, vaulting and climbing. It seemed odd to have to learn this, but put into practice, I saw its use. It took a few tries, but then the method was clear. When going into a roll, again land on the balls of the feet, bending forward with hands out. Let one slide across the ground beneath the body, bending the torso so it pulls your shoulder and body into a roll. The idea is to avoid injury to the back or knees, and compared to rolls not done in this style, this way is much more comfortable.
“I don’t like telling people to do certain moves as it has the effect of limiting what people think they can do,” Kravit said. “They lose their creativity. It’s that creativity that really helps people figure out the ‘right’ way to get over an obstacle to best suit their individual level of progression and ability.”
That said, there are many ways to train for parkour. The idea is to work the entire body. Plyometrics like clap push-ups and box jumps are extremely effective — the former especially, as it helps with wall jumps. Running or playing soccer can help with building and handling momentum. The idea for this is strength and endurance. Even crabwalks are a useful exercise, as they work the entire body, especially if the abdomen is kept lifted the entire time.
And these definitely work. The day after your first workout, expect to be a little sore — especially in places you didn’t think you would be. Even if you’re doing a full body fitness routine throughout the week, this will test your physicality, both muscular and cardiovascular endurance.
Parkour even helps sharpen problem-solving skills by training the mind to approach obstacles in unconventional ways. Instead of looking at a wall and having to go out of your way to get around it, vault it. It destroys functional fixedness, or how the mind links certain things with only one solution or use.
“The mindset that is instilled by parkour teaches us how to approach obstacles in life and make choices to handle them,” Kravit said.
At first glance, parkour might seem like a spectacle, not an effective, practical workout. But it’s probably the most unique and flexible of any workout plan, and infinitely practical in an urban environment like Los Angeles. So go outside and do it. Find some rails, walls, anything. Go out and be active.

TOO EASY
Please do not refer to Parkour as ‘quirky.’ It requires strength, speed, agility and skill. Traceurs are some of the most dedicated athletes you will find.

Ben Rector, one of Nashville’s most audacious new artists, recently released Something Like This, an 11-track album that takes listeners on an unpredictable ride of love, heartache and spirituality.
The record starts with “Let the Good Times Roll,” a rousing opening song that bombards listeners with a strong and abrasive brass section. The impromptu saxophone lines almost make the song feel like an upbeat Dave Matthews’ song.
The song maintains Nashville-esque originality, however, similar to that of The Civil Wars, with an enchanting back-up vocal section, giving the song breadth and complimenting Rector’s easygoing melodic lines. Rector and the brass section, specifically the saxophone, have an engaging musical dialogue that reels in listeners and gives the song a gripping, ominous quality.
In contrast, “Song for the Suburbs” is intriguing but instead reaches interest through the use of melancholy vocal lines that make listeners feel like Rector is guiding them on a musical trek.
Not only is Rector’s stylistic prowess exemplified in the dichotomy of the first two songs, but his vocal virtuosity is as well. Throughout the album, Rector successfully reaches the upper register of his vocal range, with careful falsetto and artistic expression while avoiding the whiny teenage boy sound that plagues contemporary indie-pop records.
The tracks “Never Gonna Let You Go” and “Without You” seem to go hand in hand. The songs mesh thematically and musically with bluesy sounding melodies, gracing listeners with choruses that ebb like waves of palpable emotion.
“Hide Away” similarly contains great musical taste and insight, but is a strategic roadblock, impeding the album’s driving momentum. The track features a semi-gospel feel and a slow-moving choral chant, making the song stand out as a unique detour from Rector’s intense, emotional ride.
While the introductory tracks captivate listeners with ardent tones and dynamic instrumentals, the middle of the album falters as it gives the impression that Rector is trying too hard, bogging down the album’s vigor.
For instance, in “You and Me,” Rector sings a recurring “ha-ha” in falsetto that sounds more like a melodic rendition of Enya than his own personal style, and it sticks out like a sore thumb. Though Rector’s artistic expression is usually effective, it is questionable on this track.
Likewise, on “She Is,” Rector seems to emulate bands like The Fray and Maroon 5 — again not making the song his own. The song does, however, have catchy lyrics and an echoing chorus that redeems the song for some of its poor taste. The awkward stylistic homages are minor details in Rector’s overall project.
Rector does, however, vindicate himself as the album finishes. Tracks like “Wanna Be Loved” and “Way I Am” exemplify Rector’s expertise as a performer and album-maker. The songs link together fluidly, with cohesive transitions that will make listeners feel like they’re listening to an extended work of art.
“Falling in Love” also speaks to Rector’s creative touch, featuring vibrato whistling — odd at first, but sure to grow on listeners — interspersed with passionate vocals and his signature falsetto. The song is framed perfectly, setting up for the album’s finale.
“Home” closes the album with an uncanny sense of gusto and fortissimo that could easily rival a gospel choir or a marching band — or both. Rector creates a surreal vibe by giving the finale of his album sonic breadth along with touching vocal harmonies and jazzy, sweeping, keyboard passageways.
At first listen, Rector’s finale seems like a cacophony of oddly arranged instruments and harmonies, but the overall effect is unique and satisfying. By “Home’s” finish, listeners won’t feel like they’ve finished a song, but a musical work of art that spanned 11 tracks.
One of the biggest strengths of Something Like This is Rector’s ability to construct a streamlined work of art. All the songs in the album fit effortlessly together, and when listeners play the album through — from start to finish — Rector’s genius shines through.
The only qualms listeners will run into will be the repetitive drumbeats and the lack of overarching, thematic diversity. Many of the songs appear, at face value, to be about love, heartbreak and romance.
For some, this might get boring.
Something Like This, however, is an incredible indie drop; the album’s flaws are minor. Rector’s career is just beginning, and he already has an incredible amount of versatility as a vocal artist and an alarming range of songwriting creativity.
“She Is” sounds like Maroon 5?!?!?!? Are you retarded?
5 out of 11 songs aren’t really about love, heartbreak, or romance. I’d say that’s a much greater ratio than most records! I don’t understand that argument for this record.

Israel and U.S. relationship under strain 
Today marks the day the Palestinian Authority will request the United Nations to recognize the Palestinian territories (Gaza Strip and the West Bank) as the State of Palestine.
Because of the PA’s unilateral decision to go to the U.N., it has deeply worsened the possibility of future direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.
Though to the untrained eye it would seem as if Palestinians are finally just taking the opportunity to establish their own state, the real reason for going through all this trouble is to punish Israel, or as mentioned in The New York Times article, “Palestinians would be entitled to bring cases against Israeli officials.”
According to Khaled Abu Toameh, a reporter for the Jerusalem Post, Palestinians have openly admitted (on Arabs news programs) to their desire to punish the State of Israel and have devised a carefully constructed plan to achieve their goal. (These steps are also outlined in The New York Times’ “In Seeking Statehood, Palestinians Stir Concern” Sept. 11 story.)
The plan begins today when Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will apply for statehood with the United Nations Security Council. The United States, Israel’s strongest ally, has already promised to veto his request.
According to Abu Toameh, Abbas would then make an appeal with the U.N. General Assembly, where there is no opportunity for a veto and where there is a pro-Palestinian majority. Though the General Assembly cannot grant Palestinians United Nations membership, it can affirm Palestinian statehood by declaring it as an observer state.
Once Palestinians are granted statehood, Abu Toameh says they will have the ability to join the International Criminal Court and ultimately achieve their goal of punishing Israel by bringing cases against Israeli officials who allowed for the building of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
Further, Palestinians will supposedly seek to ensure Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territories, or what will by then be officially referred to as Palestine.
For years, Israelis have attempted to diplomatically work out the issues between the two conflicting nations.
By deciding to go to the U.N., Palestinians are letting Israel’s metaphorical ship sail away.
Without working together and without two sides that want peace, the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis has a significantly worse chance of being resolved.
Thank goodness for the United States’ loyalty to Israel because at this point, it’s the only hope in avoiding significantly more tension between Israel and Palestine.
That being said, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal all reported last week that not only has Israel’s relationship with former allies Turkey and Egypt frayed, but its current relationship with the United States is under intense strain.
Hopefully, Israel and the United States will stoically overcome this tough hurdle and reinforce their strong bond once again.

I haven’t read up on this as much as I should.
What does the resolution that Abbas is going to propose to the UN say the borders will be for the Palestinian state?   
If it passes, will this conflict then just be a border dispute and a dispute on monetary compensation for the refugees?   
Will the Palestinians then recognize that the newly created state will be the Palestinian homeland where the refugees can settle into and give up on the idea of flooding Israel with refugees and making it a second Palestinian state?
The Trojan protects Israel and those who embrace its mythology by, among other things, refusing a paid advertisement we sought to place in its pages promoting open debate on the historical subjects encompassed lately by the term “the Holocaust.”
The Trojan and, no doubt, USC stands solidly with Israel.
Its student body is more . . . diverse. How about Open Debate on the Nakba?
How bout an open debate on Rwanda, America’s treatment of Native Americans, or Cambodia?  Hell, I don’t think genocide in Rwanda happened at all…  Let’s debate it!
The Trojan is run by students, fyi, so I have no idea what you’re trying to say.
Why don’t you go “debate” the Holocaust with your imaginary friend and leave the real discourse to us adults.  You are entitled to your opinion, but if it is so incredibly stupid just keep it to yourself.
America stands by Israel now and forever.  
Good opinion piece, well written and articulate.
Why does the DT continue to publish BS from this girl? Every year they publish multiple inane and ridiculously bigoted articles from her and never provide a counterpoint to balance the perspective.
Ridiculously bigoted?  Grow up kid.  She was very fair and while it wasn’t meant to be an in-depth analysis, it was pretty accurate.
Why must you insult everything you disagree with?  Just say you disagree.
She was fair? She said that Israel’s been trying to “diplomatically” solve the conflict between them and Palestine for years, when in reality, Palestinians keep getting pushed out of their homes and slaughtered on the streets. (remember when they bombed and killed the people in the Palestinian red cross truck? of course you don’t….you only read articles in the LA Times written by Jews)
Let’s hope whatever you’re afraid of goes through so Palestine would have the right to take Israel to court and finally charge them with their international crimes that is only being ENCOURAGED by the US Media via censorship and bias.
its not black at white at all, and if anything its this lets the palestinians off a little too easy… they dont want to punish israel, they want to destroy it.  80% of palestinians see a palestinian state on the west bank and Gaza as teh precursor to a Palestine including all of Israel.  
If the palestinians and arabs wanted peace they’d sit down at the table and NEGOTIATE a just peace, but instead they prefer to beat around the bush and have the UN do its dirty work… and we are going to support the birth of nation that wont even talk to its neighbor?  come on… 
Palestinians you are making the WRONG move at the UN, and because of your anti-semitism, your own people will suffer the most. 
as a liberal, im appauled that the palestinians who i have supported for so long are so clearly seeking Israel’s destrcution, and have no respect for international law… i’m lost my respect and have learned they have no gratitude.
Thank you Aisha!
I too am a STAUNCH liberal and I can never understand why some liberals chose to blame Israel. You can’t possibly be a liberal and side with a people who have no respect for women or human rights of any kind against a democracy that respects freedom of speech and religion.
The world should show the Palestinians that they can’t commit wrongs and then cry for help when they lose.  Otherwise they will continue to act like spoiled children and ruin any prospect for peace.
Punish Israel? Are you kidding. 
After having EVERYTHING stolen from them on a daily basis, all Palestine wants are their rights, as a country, in order to redress the daily pounding that comes at the hands of Israel.  
Of course, Isreal  doesn’t want Palestine to have any means of  redress because it will interfere with their control over the Palestinians. If you think this is an equal fight, then you are just ignorant and there is no excuse for this. For every Isreali that is killed, 40 Palestinians are killed–it’s a fact. Let’s be clear about who is doing most of the killing here.
Israelis are no closer to God than are the Palestinians, it’s a fact.  It’s time they start acting like it.
If you think Israel is a democracy then you do not know what a democracy is. 
Instead of paying for and rubber stamping anything and everything that Israel does, the US should be applying pressure through boycotts and by witholding aid. Talk about a rogue ally. It’s time to give the Palestinians their due.
The world is tired of this one-way or the highway dialogue, time to try something else.
Everything stolen?  When you use such hyperbole, everyone knows you’re either ignorant or lying.
Guess what?  For every American killed in WWII, thousands of Germans and Japanese were killed.  Does that mean America was evil and they were good?  By you’re twisted and naive logic it would.  I’m completely fine being clear about who is getting killed, because it has absolutely no consequence on which side is right.
As for the “daily pounding” that comes from Israel, I believe you are referring to the retaliation strikes that Israel launches against terrorist groups that fire rockets into Israeli towns unprovoked on a daily basis.  Yes, shame on Israel for defending itself against Hamas.  
The world is tired of people like you trying to make the aggressors of this conflict look like the victims.
Good article!  Whether you support Israel or the Palestinians or both, everyone can recognize that the way to peace is through direct negotians, not a charade at the UN.
Nothing the UN can or will do is going to give the Palestinians a state.  They must grow up and negotiate instead of acting like spoiled children.
Are you serious? If it’s the one thing that I’ve learned at SC was that the picture is never as black and white as you imagine it to be; the truth is always somewhere in the middle. Can you blame the Palestinians after being kicked out of their home for wanting their own land back? Read the Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy by John Mearshimer and get into the IR program then write about international relations. On the other hand, you’re doing a fine job if u want a career in PR for Israel.
She didn’t say it’s black and white?  It was actually a really good overview of what is going on right now.  
Read The Arab Lobby by Mitchell Bard.  Or read about the pharmaceutical lobby, or the firefighter’s lobby, or almost any other country or profession’s lobby.  Nice try with the “Israel lobby” thing, but no one buys that anymore.
The Palestinian’s were not “kicked out of their home”.  They were encouraged to do so by their Arab neighbors who promised they would wipe out the Jews and then let the residents go back.  Read a history book.  
Both sides have committed mistakes and made wrongs, and the author doesn’t deny that anywhere.  She is simply saying that the tactic the Palestinians are using right now are not going to make the conflict any better, and is simply presenting another obstacle to peace.
Rather than rushing to judge, take a moment to think what is being said.  When you act like a crazy and shout out Mearshimer to everything, you immediately lose all credibility.  Insulting the author on a persona level just makes you look foolish. If you disagree policy-wise, then just state your opinion.  Otherwise, keep it to yourself.
She didn’t make it sound black and white at all.  It was a pretty spot on analysis and all she was saying was that what the Palestinians are doing is decreasing chances for peace.
And why don’t you go read The Arab Lobby by Mitchell Bard.  Or read about the pharmaceutical lobby, or the firefighter’s lobby, or any other profession or country’s lobby.   When you shout “Mearshimer” like a crazy whenever someone talks about this subject, you immediately lose all credibility.  
The Palestinian’s were not kicked out of their own land, as much as you would like to believe it.  Arab leaders in neighboring countries encouraged them to leave so that they could kill the Jews and then have everyone return and take all of Israel.  Both sides have made mistakes and done wrong since then, but the author is just pointing out that this latest tactic by the Palestinians of going to the UN is going to hurt them and chances for peace more than anything.
And rather than attacking the author personally, why don’t you maturely state your policy opinion and why you disagree.  Your comment just convinces people whose side is right… and guess what?  It’s not yours.

Last weekend, the Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council among other organizations held a New Member retreat, which essentially functioned as one of those high-school assemblies about alcohol awareness.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Couple this with AlcoholEdu for College, a two- to three-hour online alcohol education course required for incoming students at USC and other institutions, and it’s clear  the university’s policy toward alcohol education is to preach sobriety, rather than responsibility.  These programs’ attempted central message is not “Don’t drink, it’s bad” but “Please make responsible decisions about alcohol,” an agreeable position. The problem with the programs, however, is that they do not really seem to take this approach at all.
Isn’t encouraging sobriety, implicitly or explicitly, the ultimate goal of such supplemental education? Well, no — in fact it isn’t. The goal, just as the intended mission of educational company Outside the Classroom and the university, is to keep students informed so they can make their own responsible decisions about alcohol or to simply eradicate ignorance about a substance so prevalent on college campuses. To state neutrality, but then bombard us with videos and stories in which every encounter with alcohol ends catastrophically makes AlcoholEdu and programs such as the new member retreat seem both unrealistic and hypocritical.
It is easy then, to see why youth, who count hypocrisy among the many things they love to hate, are completely turned off by these programs.
Alcohol education is an invaluable resource for incoming college students, particularly for those who have not really been exposed to it before. Some situations presented in AlcoholEdu and other programs, however, did not serve that purpose because of the unrealistic depiction of alcohol consumption.
Situations are presented as if there is no middle ground between buzzed and trashed, that if a person is slurring words or having trouble keeping balance, they are automatically “dangerously drunk,” that drinking almost always ends in a huge fight with your best friend, roommate or significant other. The assumption is that there is always a right and a wrong answer for situations that are in fact too complicated to judge entirely objectively.
With several years of survey data behind Outside the Classroom that points to AlcoholEdu’s success, the group can be confident the program is bringing about a significant positive change on college campuses. The university has obviously seen this “success” and has tried to emulate the same message by pushing it toward the Greek system, specifically new members after the events of “Black Monday” last year.
Even if these programs discourage alcohol use, however, they are not accomplishing their stated mission of giving students the tools they need to make informed and responsible decisions about alcohol. Alcohol education needs to become simple and direct about information students really need to know. Maybe then we will see a real decrease in dangerous drinking practices and a real change in student attitude about drinking — changes infinitely more important than a percentage point or two.
 
 Francesca Bessey is an undeclared freshman.
Dear Francesca:
I read your article and would like to hear your ideas, and possibly those of your friends,  about how you think the  university can improve its alcohol education programs.
You stated,
“Alcohol education needs to become simple and direct about information students really need to know.”
Let’s talk. If you are open to it please call my assistant Maria at 740-5240 and schedule some time.

Drones, as used by the United States in military operations, belong to a class of machines referred to as unmanned aerial vehicles.
The term “drone” refers to an remotely controlled aircraft.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Drone pilots are often thousands of miles away, controlling their aircrafts in a manner akin to playing a video game.
But such separation also contributes to a very inhuman character to warfare. The moral and psychological implications of these developments challenge us to question just how “personal” warfare should be.
The use of drone warfare exemplifies the United States’ position as a continuing leader in technological innovation.
In addition to the advantages their smaller size gives them, drones keep the lives of many U.S. military personnel further from the dangers of face-to-face combat with the use of unmanned technology.
Ironically, however any effort to make war more humane will only have the opposite effect.
Drone warfare is a step towards making warfare at least slightly more humane. In 21st century warfare, fewer lives have been lost than in previous wars and eras.
By reducing the amount of U.S. military personnel on the battlefield, the implementation of drone warfare even further decreases the potential for lost lives on this side.
But cleaner bullets, more accurate explosives and more mechanized warfare do not necessarily constitute more “humane” warfare.
Standards of how “humane” warfare ought to be have long been a topic for international discussion.
Treaties such as the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Protocol have attempted to address some of the most horrendous forms of warfare seen in past wars.
Biological and chemical weapons are prohibited by the Geneva Protocol.
These agreements and discussions regarding the humanity of warfare suggest that although war is horrifying, it should only be horrifying to a certain extent.
This sentiment has been reflected in the United States in regard to post-traumatic stress disorder, in which much research, efforts and funds have been invested.
Drones obviously reduce the number of men in the field and will, in turn, reduce the amount of people who are effected by PTSD.
Improvements in making warfare more “humane” should not serve as justifications for conducting war more frequently or unnecessarily.
Though reducing loss of life and making warfare as least traumatic as possible is excellent, it must not serve as an impetus to belittle the significance of the horrifying aspects of war and loss of life in general.
Conducting combat through an LCD screen does not, in any way, make war more acceptable.
If the fighting itself is necessary and drone warfare presents itself as an advantageous tool, it ought to be implemented.
But drone warfare, detaching the United States from more “personal” encounters, should not encourage increased combat engagements.
 
Alan Wong is a sophomore majoring in East Asian languages and cultures. His column “Re-Defining USC” runs Tuesdays.
Mr. Alan Wong writes a good and generally factual letter on use of unmanned aerial vehicles, (UAVs) (he calls them “drones”) but makes a common mistake. He suggests that the existence of an effective weapon system like the UAV might cause the US President to commit our forces to unnecessary combat actions. That is not the case. The President, for a variety of tactical, strategic or political reasons, might commit our forces to combat. Sometimes these reasons have appeared hare-brained or even vicious to some.
In no case; however, has a President committed US forces merely because a weapons system like the UAV was efficient and available. He may dictate to the military that it limit itself to a specific weapon system, e.g., aircraft to support Libyan rebels, but he has not initiated conflicts simply because he had a certain weapons system.
And where “humaneness” of weapons is concerned, US military doctrine and practice have always been to avoid destroying civilian life and property unnecessarily, although this is subject to military requirements. The “humaneness” of UAV’s lies in the fact that they are very precise, guided systems and create a minimum of collateral damage. More important, they avoid subjecting US service personnel to becoming wounded and killed during strikes against the enemy. It is the military mission, then humaneness to Americans, that counts most in warlike actions, where evaluating the effects of weapons on the enemy

At around 10:15 Saturday night, I walked into Bottega Louie. This chic downtown eatery, located on Grand Avenue, is absolutely stunning. The ceilings are high, the restaurant incredibly spacious and the décor elegant.
The front is dedicated to the bakery, where colorful layers of macarons lay stacked upon each other. For just a moment, you might feel as if you have been transported somewhere far from Los Angeles; I feel it most resembles the Louvre. The place was packed, and although the hostess said my party would have to wait half an hour, we were seated in half that time.
The waiters were attentive and immediately asked us what we’d like to drink. I ordered ‘the east end,’ a cocktail composed of gin, st. germain liquor, lime, simple syrup and blackberries ($12). For appetizers, we ordered the Portobello fries and the arancini, both $9.
Though I appreciated the idea, the Portobello fries were greasy and not properly seasoned. The arancini, fried rice balls with cheese and ham, were much better. They were served on a bed of tomato sauce, and the filling had a nice smoky flavor.
For my main course, I ordered the Napoli pizza, which was topped with red onions, mushrooms, black olives, tomato sauce and mozzarella. The ingredients complemented each other nicely and the dough was perfect — not too crisp, not too chewy. It was also surprisingly light. For $18, this pizza is perfect for two when paired with some appetizers.
For dessert, I shared the chocolate soufflé, which had to be ordered 20 minutes in advance. Though beautiful, the flavor was disappointing. It was not rich or chocolaty enough, and the taste of flour lingered. Better stick with the macaroons.
Bottega Louie is definitely a restaurant worth trying. Though the restaurant’s beauty is more consistent than the food, the aesthetics alone make up for it.
