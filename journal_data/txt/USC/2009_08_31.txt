It was a tough day for the No. 12 USC women’s soccer team Friday, as it battled both the extreme dry heat and the Mexican national team. Unfortunately for the Women of Troy, both the temperature (which reached the upper 90s) and the opposing team were hot as Mexico beat USC 2-0.
Mexico controlled the ball for most of the match because its quick play and one-two balls were too fast for the Women of Troy. Senior goalkeepers Kristin Olsen and redshirt Brittany Massro played one half each for the Women of Troy, and they did their best to keep USC in the game as they came up with some big saves.

But it was two late Mexican goals, one at the end of each half, that proved to be the difference. Just as in the game against Texas A&M last weekend, USC managed to keep the ball out of its net for most of the half but was seeking the final whistle four minutes too early.
“I don’t think we dug deep enough or showed enough passion,” said senior defender Meagan Holmes. “I think that’s what it came down to because both goals were in the last five minutes of both halves.”
Coach Ali Khosroshahin started eight freshmen and sophomores with little collegiate experience in the exhibition match against Mexico. Even though USC is returning seven starters from last year’s team, Khosroshahin wanted to get some younger players playing time and give them an opportunity to show they belong on the field. But not many players impressed the coach.
“We’re very green is definitely something I walked away with,” Khosroshahin said. “There are players that got opportunities they may not get again.”
USC’s inexperience showed on the field as it tried to find some chemistry. There were times when the Women of Troy were able to string many passes together, but it was the transition from the backline to the front line where they struggled the most.
“We need to transition better. We are really having a poor time getting the ball from one end to the other,” Khosroshahin said. “I attribute it to inconsistency.”
Mexico’s forward Monica Ocampo frustrated the Women of Troy throughout the entire game. She threatened to score numerous times in the first half and, even though USC had a few shots, Ocampo and Mexico were the more dangerous team in the first half.
In fact, it was Ocampo’s goal in the waning moments of the first half that gave Mexico the 1-0 lead. Ocampo got the ball at the top of the box, dribbled around Holmes and fired the shot past a diving Olsen.
The second half was more of the same. USC didn’t create many opportunities in the attacking third and turned the ball over, letting Mexico take possession of the ball and charge at the backline without much resistance. The defense did have three new starters on the field, but they couldn’t contain the dynamic Mexican offense.
“I thought we were very, very soft defensively,” Khosroshahin said. “We just needed to win a tackle and we couldn’t do that. I tried to get players some time but it was disappointing.”
Mexico scored its second goal with just under four minutes left on the clock in the second half, as a nifty through ball by Evelyn Lopez found Tania Morales behind the defense as she slotted it past Massro for the clinching goal.
Even though the Women of Troy weren’t able to keep up with the Mexican national team, they tried to learn from the match. Freshman Kat Parker played the entire game in the midfield and saw what the Women of Troy needed to work on.
“Probably just switching sides more, finding open spaces and attacking as a group instead of individuals,” she said.
Khosroshahin knew that playing Mexico would be a tough test for the Women of Troy, and despite the problems, he took some positives out of the match.
“We don’t face too many teams that move the ball like them. We can learn from this,” he said.

They say when it comes to love, age is nothing but a number.
But what about when it comes to the USC football team, which seems to have no qualms about starting an 18-year-old kid fresh out of high school?
Considering that many Trojan fans pay more attention to this team than their lovers, I guess the same rule applies.
Coach Pete Carroll announced Thursday that boy wonder Matt Barkley will start USC’s first game Sept. 5 against San Jose State, setting Barkley up to be the first true freshman quarterback to start a season opener at USC.
Talk about pressure.
But Carroll knows that if this love affair — er, quarterback situation — is going to work, Barkley can’t handle himself like a high school kid with jitters on prom night.
And fortunately for the Trojans, Barkley appears eons ahead of his time.
Since the day he set foot on the practice field, Barkley generated a buzz around Trojan football circles. Then after Carroll began to rave about him during spring practice, the hype grew to Coliseum-sized proportions.
Now, after Barkley was surprisingly tapped as the starter over third-year sophomore Aaron Corp, Barkley is basically all anyone wants to talk about.
Yet the kid with the golden arm said he doesn’t even allow those things to enter his mind.
When asked if he felt like people were watching his every move Saturday at USC’s final intrasquad scrimmage, Barkley was unfazed.
“I don’t think about that. I try to just picture that I’m at practice,” he said. “I try to block all that stuff out.”
To be clear, pressure in sports is not a phenomenon that athletes imagine. Pressure is real — it’s tangible, it’s heavy and it affects one guy more than any other on a football field: the quarterback.
So for Barkley to imply that he easily blocks the pressure out is of course a complete falsehood. But the fact that he’s saying he does shows he’s wise beyond his years.
Being a leader is often about how you handle yourself rather than the way you actually feel inside.
There is no question that Barkley is under the most intense pressure to perform. Every interception he throws will be scrutinized. Every bad read he makes will be attributed to his age. But if the way you handle yourself counts for anything, then Barkley, despite his inexperience, has my vote of confidence.
Carroll would not have made this choice if he weren’t 100 percent certain Barkley would give the Trojans a better chance to win games than Corp. That doesn’t mean Carroll isn’t wrong — only the games can decide that — but the way Barkley carries himself offsets his age.
That includes being honest about what he needs to improve on.
“[I need to] just get everything quicker, my reads and my footwork,” he said after the scrimmage.
He admitted that he was still over-thinking things on the field a little bit, “but for the most part, I am playing and just reacting to what the defense is giving me.”
Barkley clearly has the maturity and mental capability to play quarterback right now at USC. He has all the physical tools — a 6-foot-4 stature, an NFL arm and pocket presence. He has produced in game-like situations — 156 yards and one touchdown in this most recent scrimmage.
Barkley’s biggest challenge, then, will be to simmer down his gunslinger mentality.
Barkley can draw from the example of Mark Sanchez. What held Sanchez back early in his career with the Trojans was not that he wasn’t able to make throws and reads, but that he too often tried to squeeze the ball between multiple defenders or go for the home run every chance he got.
“That’s what really kept Sanchez down for a long time when he was a young guy coming up,” Carroll said. “He kept trying so hard to make something happen and he couldn’t catch John David [Booty] because of that.”
Obviously Barkley has been able to wrangle in his inner-Mark Sanchez enough to put himself in the starting position. But that doesn’t mean the process is finished.
“That’s what all quarterbacks have to fix, all quarterbacks have to stop trying so hard,” Carroll said. “That will continue to be an issue.”
Barkley showed warning signs of risk-taking in his high school days, when he threw 18 interceptions in his senior year at Mater Dei.
Saturday’s scrimmage also pointed to some growing pains Barkley will likely struggle with early on in his career at USC. On his very first play, his foot got caught up with one of the offensive linemen as the ball was snapped, causing him to stumble as he flicked the ball to running back Joe McKnight.
“Good start,” Barkley said smiling, when asked about what immediately came to his mind.
Later in the practice game, with the offense threatening near the goal line, Barkley scrambled to his right and chucked the ball toward the endzone where it was almost intercepted.
Barkley claimed he was trying to throw the pass away where no one could catch it, but it was dangerously close to being a turnover. He later responded by throwing a touchdown to sophomore tight end Blake Ayles and running for a score as well.
When Barkley takes the field Saturday, no one should expect a mistake-free outing. He will make throws he would like to have back, he will miss reads and he may even (heaven forbid) throw interceptions.
But if his overall performance translates into victories, he will have won over the hearts and minds of the Trojan faithful.
Within the team and on the USC campus, it seems the romance has already begun.

The No. 12 USC women’s volleyball team had a shaky start at the Michigan State University Showcase tournament but managed to leave with two sweeps on the last day of competition.
The Women of Troy lost their season opener against tournament host Michigan State in five sets (23-25, 27-25, 25-18, 22-25, 15-9) but bounced back the following day, sweeping North Carolina (25-11, 25-22, 25-16) and Albany (25-16, 25-14, 25-21).
On track · Sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter continued where she left off last season, leading USC in kills in the opening tournament. - Joshua Sy | Daily Trojan
The Spartans outhit the Women of Troy .248 to .167 in Friday’s tournament opener. USC built a 17-11 lead in the first set, but a hitting error by junior outside hitter Kimmee Roleder allowed Michigan State to close the gap. USC pulled out the first set, but the Spartans responded to win the next two sets behind competitive play.
It looked like the Spartans would take the fourth set as well after the Women of Troy committed three hitting errors in a row. But senior outside hitter Jessica Gysin tied the score at 20-20, and sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter used her powerful kill and blocking to break the tie and give USC the chance to head to one more set.
The chance alone was not enough to give the USC the win, however. The Spartans ran away with the lead in the final set, despite sophomore setter Kendall Bateman and Jupiter’s best efforts.
Jupiter showcased a team-high 20 kills and 14 digs while hitting .250 in the loss. Gysin contributed 17 kills and nine digs, and Bateman had a career-high 55 assists to go along with five digs and two blocks. USC also debuted three freshman players: outside hitter Katie Fuller and defensive specialists Carolyn Hillgren and Erin Yoder.
Saturday proved to be a better day for USC. In the second game of the tournament against North Carolina, Jupiter once again led her team with 11 kills, while four other Women of Troy had eight or more kills. USC started the match with a 10-8 lead in the first set, when Roleder, junior middle blocker Zoe Garrett and junior defensive specialist Geena Urango took a lead and ran with it.
Jupiter and Garrett stole the lead from the Tarheels with a few intense kills in the second set, giving the Women of Troy a 2-0 advantage heading into the third set.
It was all smooth sailing from there for USC, as it used a 5-1 run to build an 11-6 lead and finish off the match.
The team only had a few hours to rest before it was at it again, competing in its last match of the tournament against Albany. where USC’s positive energy traveled right into the next game.
Roleder had 11 kills against the Great Danes and hit an impressive .526. Jupiter also had 11 kills and added three service aces. Urango chipped in two more aces, as well as six digs and eight kills.
USC hit .356 and recorded seven aces in the match, while holding Albany to .187 hitting.
The Women of Troy head back to Los Angeles to play their first home game next weekend, where they will host the Holiday Inn LA City Center Trojan Invitational. Their first match is Thursday against Florida Gulf Coast, 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.

Matt Barkley left the Coliseum on Saturday as the undeniable leader of the USC offense, but the team’s mock game still left the unit with plenty of unanswered questions.
Wide receiver Ronald Johnson broke his collarbone during the scrimmage and is expected to miss six to eight weeks. The injury is the latest blow to an offense that has already seen its starting line reshuffled because of various health concerns.
Unwelcome news · Junior receiver Ronald Johnson will be out for at least six weeks after breaking his collarbone in Saturday’s scrimmage- Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
Johnson was hurt in the first quarter after hauling in a 34-yard pass from Barkley. He attempted to retreat to the sideline after the play, but collapsed to the ground before being helped off by trainers.
“It’s just a crusher,” USC coach Pete Carroll said of the injury.
Johnson was one of the team’s top big-play threats last season after averaging a team-high 17.3 yards per reception. His injury will move David Ausberry into the starting lineup at split end and push Damian Williams back to flanker, where he started last season.
Brice Butler, who led all receivers with 66 yards on four catches, and freshman De’Von Flournoy are also expected to figure into the wide receiver rotation in Johnson’s absence.
“We’ll be OK,” Williams said. “We’ve still got great guys here. We’ve got to keep on pushing, but we’re definitely going to miss him.”
Barkley remained the focus for most throughout the day. Playing in his first scrimmage as the starter, Barkley completed 10 of 17 passes for 159 yards with one touchdown and one interception to help lead USC’s starters to a 36-0 win against the scout team.
The first drive proved tough for the 18-year-old, as a lineman stepped on his leg during the first play, which he salvaged by flipping the ball to Joe McKnight. But on Barkley’s third throw of the day, defensive end Devon Kennard dropped back in coverage and tipped the ball into the air, where freshman defensive back Byron Moore leapt for the interception.
Barkley eventually settled down and connected with Blake Ayles on a short bootleg pass for his lone touchdown through the air.
Carroll said Barkley “missed some chances” and that he had to continue his rapid maturation into the season.
“To think, how could he possibly be a finished product at this point? But we’re kind of expecting it,” Carroll said.
The weight of being the first true freshman tabbed to start an opener at USC was not lost on Barkley.
“It’s a great feeling, but it didn’t change the way I’m approaching anything or how I play the game,” Barkley said. “It’s great to know that everyone is supporting me and coming behind me knowing that I’m the guy.”
Aaron Corp, who entered fall camp as the starting quarterback, played two series and went 5-of-7 passing for 89 yards. The redshirt sophomore showed improved mobility from previous practices, in which the effects of his cracked left fibula were still hampering his scrambling.
Carroll said that his decision to name Barkley the starter would have remained the same if he had held off until after the scrimmage to make his decision, but he was encouraged by Corp’s recovery.
“I said to him a couple days ago, ‘When you finally take off and hook slide, I’ll know you’re ready,’ and he did,” Carroll said. “He kind of gave me a little look, ‘OK,’ which was great. He’s ready to play.”

Anyone who works in the world of 9-to-5 professionalism is forced to abide by a dress code with some basic rules that apply to employees all the way from Little Rock to the Big Apple. In many offices — my New Jersey law office included — the attire is set as “business casual.”
The term “business casual” is a bit abstract, but certain things are universally understood: no sequined crop tops, booty shorts, combat boots or assless chaps. But beyond the aforementioned obvious no-no’s, few things are widely presumed.
To be honest, it worries me to think about the wardrobe choices that my co-workers feel comfortable sporting in an upscale office with double glass doors, marble countertops and flat-screen monitors.
One such case being the top legal assistant, who seemed to think she could outsmart the dress code. She’s a single mother with two young children and she works like a dog, both at home and in the office. So perhaps that’s why no one reprimanded her for donning loungewear at work.
Peering over my cubicle, I caught a glimpse of her troubling ensemble: a ribbed sweater with a pair of swishy blue sweats fitted with adjustable bungee cords and toggles. Casual? Sure. Business? Not so much. She completed the look with a pair of black heels, presumably hoping the heels would balance out the sweat pants. In the law world, they would look at this lapse of judgment and persuade her to plead temporary insanity.
One might expect these sorts of fashion errors from secretaries, but the attorneys are equally guilty. For example, there is one 30-something attorney we’ll call Peter Griffin. There’s no special reason behind this moniker, other than a dumpy physique, wire-framed glasses and a one-note nasally laugh reminiscent of the Family Guy father by the same name.
Now being heavy, with the majority of the weight distributed in the midsection, poses problems for unevenly proportioned dressers everywhere. And if you’re fat and not particularly tall, well, now you’re really in a fix. Peter Griffin is one of millions of obese Americans who struggles to find work-appropriate shirts that don’t leave gaping holes between buttons.
So he buys that XXL Oxford shirt, but a new problem arises: the sleeves hang like wizard’s sleeves and the shirt is so long it could double as a minidress. The poor guy has to tuck in all of that excess fabric into his Dockers. Despite his best efforts, his shirttails still hang out over his flat backside. Shirt untucked and belt fastened below his gut, he tends to look more disheveled than dapper.
Other particularly troubling instances are the days when established attorneys pop into the office for only a couple of hours to tie up some loose ends. Many times they use these half-days as the perfect excuse to rock an old pair of Levis. After all, there’s no one who’s going to tell them to change when they’re only “popping in.”
And even though many of them make enviable salaries, so few seem to have purchased a pair of jeans since they graduated from law school in 1983. The law may not have changed much since then, but jeans have gone through some considerable revisions, including farewells to fringe, acid wash and the tapered leg. Sadly, the attorneys have not severed ties with these out-of-vogue styles.
Beyond being utterly outdated, the attorneys’ body compositions have likely changed some since graduation day. This means larger men are now squeezing into the same small pants of their glory days. Their man-parts are suffocating, creating the previously unprecedented “male camel toe.” And you thought the female version was offensive.
Ball-choking bottoms are an eyesore that pain the wearer physically and the viewer emotionally. Many a night I’ve woken up in a cold sweat recalling a nightmare featuring Chaz Bono sporting the male camel toe (shudders).
But the real problem with god-awful fashion in the workplace is that while it can occasionally disturb the sleep patterns of the innocent file clerk, it also indicates a lack of professionalism. To most, a sharp dresser on the outside means a sharp mind within. And what could be more important than that?
In the case of Unkempt v. Well-Kept, it is the judgment of this column that you shall be sentenced to a life term of unemployment should you dress like an escort instead of an esquire.

It’s been a long time coming — four years to be exact — but Imogen Heap has finally released her third solo album, Ellipse. It’s an event comparable to the second coming for her devoted cult following, and boy, was it worth the wait.
In recent years, the British electropop artist has become a ubiquitous, though frequently mispronounced, name in the music industry.
A lovely heap · Electropop artist Imogen Heap, whose music appeared on The O.C., released her third solo album, Ellipse, last week. - Photo courtesy of Imogen Heap
Even if you’re not one of Heap’s diehard enthusiasts, you’ve probably heard her synthesizer-heavy tunes in movies like Garden State (as part of music duo Frou Frou), The Holiday and The Chronicles of Narnia. Her songs have also graced TV shows such as The O.C. and Heroes, rendering their climactic moments hauntingly poetic.
Hollywood’s affection for the 31-year-old songstress is understandable; Heap’s inventive tunes are dynamic and densely textured, each one an auditory tour de force with emotional highs and lows.
All the recent attention, however, had many worried in lieu of Ellipse’s release: Would the new album live up to heightened expectations?
Heap’s most revered attribute has always been her audacity — her eagerness to experiment with different sounds and open up new worlds of musical possibility that we never knew existed.
Ellipse proves that Heap is still just as imaginative, inspired and, yes, audacious as she was when she first marked her electropop territory in 1998 with i Megaphone, a rebellious, attitude-filled debut. Though far from perfect, Heap’s first solo album was a courageous and innovative blip on the indie-electronic music radar.
After i Megaphone, Heap joined forces with Guy Sigsworth to make up indie duo Frou Frou. The pair released Details in 2002, a considerably lighter but still incredibly original collection of electropop songs that enjoyed a resurge of attention when “Let Go” was featured in the final scene of Garden State.
Then in 2005 came Speak for Yourself, Heap’s fearless and eloquent second solo album. The evocatively slow, vocoder-heavy a cappella number “Hide and Seek” is everything we hope for in a song: different, original and affecting. “Just for Now,” “Headlock” and “The Moment I Said It” were just a few other stirring numbers on the breathtaking album that had fans begging for more.
If there’s one big no-no in the music industry, it’s following a great album with a mediocre one. So while Imogen Heap took her time with her next album, we waited. And waited.
Now, with Ellipse released at last, the woman can sleep in peace — and we can blissfully enjoy her oh-so-sweet sounds.
The album opens with full force with “First Train Home,” a quintessential Imogen Heap number with a solid hook, catchy refrain and interesting vocal percussions.
The second track, “Wait It Out,” is elegiac and poignant, eloquently conveying a sense of impatience, longing and melancholy in its simple musicianship and lyrics. The chorus is understated but meaningful: Everybody says time heals everything / But what of the wretched hollow? / The endless inbetween / Are we just going to wait it out?
But “Earth,” an a cappella arrangement, is the first true stunner on the album. For three minutes and 35 seconds, Heap’s riveting vocal harmonies and percussions stop you in your tracks, making you wonder how so many sounds can originate from one person.
That sense of surprise and intrigue stays with you for the rest of Ellipse. “Tidal” is buoyant and optimistic where “2-1” is dark and heavy. The whimsical “Aha!” and cheeky “Bad Body Double” reveal Heap at her most mischievous, recalling the attitude of her debut album. “The Fire,” an instrumental track, acts as a pleasant surprise and breather on the record. “Canvas,” with its soft, flowing melody and gentle guitar-plucking, is just plain hypnotic.
One of the album’s quirkiest numbers is “Little Bird,” an extended, poetic apostrophe that, combined with the dreamlike synthesizer layered beneath the vocals, is completely ethereal and affecting.
Attitude and audacity aside, Heap shines the most in her simplest, quietest moments, reminding us of the recession-proven truth that sometimes less is more.
The album’s closer, “Half Life,” ends the record with a contemplative, lyrical whisper, holding you close to the very end.
Ellipse isn’t one of those albums you can put on for background music; it calls for you to drop everything and listen. Each song is a gift you have to carefully unwrap, a story you have to read from beginning to end and a work of art you have to examine from a variety of angles to truly appreciate.
In the era of formulaic, unoriginal and mass-produced songs, that, my friends, is what we call music.

Though our generation is generally open-minded, sex can still  be an uncomfortable, cringe-worthy subject for some.
Done right, sex is a safe, healthy, feel-good part of life, yet it is a subject that oftentimes leads to awkward conversations. Sex is the reason we are on this planet, however, and all discussion of the activity should be encouraged.
One of the most important steps in one’s sexual progression, whether a virgin or an expert, is being able to identify and express exactly what you want out of your sex life.  Once you know what you like, you can express this to your partner, and both of you can enjoy a healthy and satisfying relationship.
This is the core of Adrian Colesberry’s new book, How To Make Love to Adrian Colesberry, a humorous satire that attempt to broaden our current cultural limitations when it comes to sex. As Colesberry’s website claims, “No one can love you for who you are until you tell them how to love you.” The book is literally a manuscript about how Colesberry wants to be loved. It is written in third person, covering everything from what physical types he looks for to how he wants to be treated in bed. In an effort to share the joy he discovered in expressing his personal tastes with the world, Colesberry created a website, howtomakeloveto.com. The site features an exciting and innovative program that allows you, the bored and sexually curious web user, to write your own book about the one topic you know better than anyone else: yourself.
Choose “Write Your Book” from the website’s top menu bar, and the program begins by asking you some basic questions: what your name is, whether you are a man or a woman or prefer not to be identified in such polarizing terms, and whether you want the book to be written in first person or third.
From there on, the fun truly begins. You are able to write your book as creatively as you please. The introduction to your book is merely a large blank text box in which you can go wild as you express to the world exactly what turns you on and how you wish to pursue and be pursued in the sexual realm. From there on, there are more specific chapters with titles such as “Dating (Your Name)” or “Making Out With (Your Name)” that ask you to answer a series of survey questions to delve into the specifics of what you like. My favorite part of the program is the optional custom story you can add at the end of each chapter; it allows you to make your book even more personal or outrageous.
The entire book-writing process takes as much or as little time as you please, depending on how specific you want to be in your customizing process. At the end, you can choose to publish your book online. Tons of “How to Make Love To” books are stored in the system, and by clicking “Read Stories” on the top menu bar you will be directed to a random chapter in an anonymous user’s book. Reading these stories are half the fun of the website; it is fascinating to see how people describe themselves and what they enjoy in their sex lives.
Surprisingly, the questions are extremely detailed, forcing the creator of the story to evaluate past sexual experiences as well as envision an ideal hook-up. The program may induce several embarrassed giggles on the part of the participant, but I encourage everyone who reads this article to log on and give it a try (just don’t do it during class, please). It is incredibly empowering; upon completion, you will probably feel like the most sexually desirable creature that has ever walked the USC campus. In the very least, you will learn a lot about yourself, which will hopefully allow you to become more comfortable asking for what you want when you next find yourself in a steamy situation. It is important to be able to identify exactly what you like and what makes you squirm and also to be able to express these feelings to your future partners.
Howtomakeloveto.com is your own special guidebook to sex, and  I encourage you not to settle for anything less than the fulfillment of all the sexual desires you pinpoint in the writing of your first “book.”
Colesberry’s simple program is a thrilling and amusing way to pass the time, and it is also unquestionably educational. Everyone can benefit from becoming more confident in who they are both inside and outside of the bedroom. We are sexual creatures, and being able to identify exactly what we want will allow us to pursue our sexuality in the safest, healthiest and most exciting way possible. So grab your laptop, get comfortable and prepare to talk about sex for a while.

Thousands of mourners lined the streets Saturday morning to pay their respects to Shia leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, who died last week from lung cancer. Although he never chose to take an active political role within the central government, his role as leader of the major Shia group the United Iraqi Alliance, his influence and the importance of his passing in Iraq is easily comparable to that of late Sen. Ted Kennedy in the United States.
In recent years, al-Hakim has been a supporter of the United States; in taking such a position, however, he had to overcome an extremely rocky past. In 1991, when the United States ousted Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, al-Hakim and his older brother, Muhammad Bakr, led a revolutionary force in the south. When the United States failed to aid them in their attempt, their forces were brutally crushed and they lost 30,000 troops and civilians.
Then in 1999, al-Hakim’s party, Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council (ISCI), refused congressional funding. His party also openly opposed US plans for invasion of Iraq in 2002. As a result, then-Vice President Dick Cheney named the group an insurgent militia. It was not until mid-2003 that the ISCI decided to join the interim council.
This was also the year that al-Hakim truly came into his own. When his older brother was killed in a suicide bombing, Abdul Aziz became the supreme leader of the party. He proved to be tremendously important in preventing civil war between Shias and Shiites, thanks to his cool-headed leadership.
In the following years, al-Hakim played a crucial role in uniting Shia factions and leading modern Iraq as a pro-American state. In 2004 he played a leading role in the successful creation of the United Iraqi Alliance, a group which brings together 22 different rival Shia factions. The importance of this union cannot be underestimated, particularly for many Americans who rely in large part upon good relations with the ISCI to continue their work in Iraq.
He was also instrumental in assuring that relations with Iran would not further disintegrate. During the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, the al-Hakim family fled to Iran and there formed the revolutionary party that continues today as ISCI. Fighting on the side of the Iranians provided al-Hakim with connections that afforded him much-needed Iranian support, although these close ties were sometimes politically harmful in Iraq.
The al-Hakim family is revered within the Shia community for its tradition of scholarship and longtime resistance to Saddam Hussein. Over the course of the resistance, al-Hakim lost eight brothers and 36 extended family members to the cause. Over the past few months, al-Hakim’s son Ammar has been preparing to succeed his father. Thanks to the prestige his family has garnered over the years, the succession process should not prove to be contentious; nevertheless, Ammar’s leadership will need to be at least as successful as his father’s if the ISCI is to thrive in the upcoming elections.
Fortunately, Ammar al-Hakim has already proven to be a talented politician. When al-Hakim fell ill in 2007, tensions arose within the United Iraqi Alliance and positive relations between all factions were only renewed days before his death. Ammar had an instrumental role in the formation of the new ticket, which excludes the Islamic Dawa Party. This was a politically important move, because it brings into the open intra-Shia schisms before the elections of January 2010.
Nevertheless, the party’s political standing was greatly damaged by the internal rivalries of the past few years. In the coming months, Ammar al-Hakim will either rise to fill his father’s shoes, or he will make decisions for which the nation will suffer.
Furthermore, America’s role in Iraq could be greatly damaged if the pro-American ISCI falls from power. In mid-2004, young Shia leader Sheikh Muqtada al-Sadr gained control of several important ISCI holdings in Southern Iraq and sought to lead an anti-American Shia party into power. Abdul Aziz Al-Hakim neutralized the group and regained the region, but al-Sadr remains a political force to be reckoned with. If the elections fall in the favor of al-Sadr or any of his ilk, American efforts in reconstructing a pro-American Iraq could be severely affected.
Over the next few months, Ammar Hakim will be closely watched by the United States government, whether he receives international media attention or not. The world will have to wait until January to determine whether his political efforts will come to fruition or flounder, along with the party.

Back home in Tennessee, my neighbors are clinging (quite vehemently) to their guns and religion. President Barack Obama got slammed for this stereotypical description of rural America, but I live on the front lines of Appalachia (to quote another 2008 candidate, “I can see it from my porch.”) and the picture he painted is accurate, even a bit understated.
The widely popular 2008 state legislation allowing concealed weapons in Tennessee’s state and national parks was followed last month by an equally celebrated law permitting concealed weapons in bars and restaurants. As of July 14, any God-fearing (is there any other kind?) gun owner in Tennessee can decide to carry a gun down to their local haunt or IHOP — just in case.
In case of what? Bad service? Flat beer? No more country ham or biscuits on the buffet?
Many Tennesseans like myself see this latest expression of the right to bear arms as a surefire way to ignite deadly bar fights. The law’s supporters strongly disagree, pointing out a provision in the statute stating that those with concealed weapons will not be allowed to drink alcohol. Well, of course, the guy with the hidden pistol will be sipping soda water at the bar all night. So, rest easy Mom and Dad. If your nice family dinner at the local steakhouse is disrupted by a gunfight, at least a drunk won’t be firing the shots.
Wrong. The fact that these weapons can be concealed completely eliminates the assurance of the “no alcohol” policy. Bartenders are generally not going to frisk their customers before serving them pitchers of Natty Light. In addition, local Tennesseans — the voice behind this ruling in the first place — rarely take heed of the fine print of the laws set in Nashville. The main point — guns are now allowed in bars — will get through to those gun-wielding yahoos long before the “no alcohol” part ever registers.
Since some Tennessee bar and restaurant owners are a tad bit concerned about having weapons in their businesses (“the customer is always right” takes on a whole new meaning when the customer is holding a .45), some are installing metal detectors for safety. Hey, it’s only fair. Tennessee kids have to walk through detectors to get into public school each day, so why not make the adults walk through them when they go out to eat? Still others — though not the majority — are posting signs that expressly forbid weapons on the premises.
Many USC students would find this more than a little absurd. Living part of the year in Los Angeles,  we’ve watched enough news coverage of deadly shootings to understand why allowing concealed weapons in parks where children play isn’t a bright idea.
So why should we care about a silly gun law or two in the land of NASCAR?
Well, for starters, living in Los Angeles makes us believe that the rest of the country either thinks like us or wants to be us. Any law putting guns within shooting distance of protected animals in national parks has to be a joke, right? Not true. In the South, you don’t mess with a guy’s guns or religion (multiple guns, one religion) and flag or freedoms (one flag, multiple freedoms). And in case you hadn’t heard, Tennessee also has a roadkill law. You find it on the road, you can eat it. But don’t hunt using your car or pickup as a weapon. There’s a fine for that.
Second, any state’s gun laws — even in a state as geographically and culturally distant from California as Tennessee — could have an impact on us. If you’re lucky enough to score Bonnaroo tickets some year, take a road trip to visit Elvis’ grave at Graceland or drive coast-to-coast on I-40, you’ll be in Tennessee. That means the girl sitting next to you in that Waffle House could be hiding a handgun in her hoodie, or the jerk hitting on you at a club could settle the next argument in a blaze of bullets.
Tennessee is not alone in allowing concealed weapons — in fact, it is the latest in a group of states to legalize them. State laws that put concealed guns in public parks, bars and restaurants are worth our time and attention. There’s a big, old country out there, and we should feel free — and safe — enough to explore it all.

With hopes of alleviating an increasingly large housing shortage in the USC area, developers of the University Gateway Apartments will begin leasing the building’s apartments ­— opening for the 2010-2011 school year — as soon as Sept. 4 of this year.
Though leasing is beginning nearly a whole year in advance of the building’s scheduled completion date, developers said they are confident the building will be ready in time for students to move in.
Leasing · The new Gateway Welcome Center — located in the University Village — will help students view and lease apartments. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan
“We don’t anticipate any delays, and at this point. Urban [Partners] along with our builder, Clark Construction, are ahead of schedule in terms of delivering the building,” said Matt Burton, principal at Urban Partners LLC, the firm that owns University Gateway Apartments.
The building — located at the northwest corner of Figueroa Street and Jefferson Boulevard — will offer one-year leases on 421 apartments. Of the available units, 407 will be two-bedroom apartments and 14 will be one-bedroom apartments, totaling 1,650 beds.
“The more housing in this area the better,” said Christina Carey, a senior majoring in international relations. “This school is becoming increasingly more and more of a ‘go away to school’ school instead of a commuter school, and the university should be able to provide housing for all students.”
Though Urban Partners does not anticipate a huge rush immediately, leasing is opening this fall in order to generate interest in the building and to give students an opportunity to see what it has to offer, said John L. Hrovat, also a principal at Urban Partners.
“I really don’t expect a whole bunch of leasing in the first month,” Hrovat said. “I’ve got a product that nobody knows. There’s a whole process of establishing what your brand is and making sure that people understand here’s what it is, here’s what the building offers, here’s the amenities.”
Though Hrovat acknowledged that most students would not be apartment shopping seriously until next year, he added there has already been interest in the building, with approximately 100 people already on the pre-leasing list.
“Parents have called up to say, ‘I have a child with an allergy situation and I don’t want to put them in an old building.’ … There have been some people who’ve said, ‘I want to be in that building early,’” Hrovat said.
Pricing for the units has not yet been announced — those details will be revealed closer to the day leasing begins. Many students said cost will significantly impact whether they consider living in the Gateway apartments next year.
“Price is definitely the most important thing,” said Sergio Ruiz, a senior majoring in neuroscience. “Everything around ’SC is really, really expensive and being a first generational student it’s kind of hard to afford a lot of the housing that’s around here.”
Some students also expressed wariness over signing a lease while the building is still under construction.
“I think they could promise certain things to be in there and they would end up not putting them in, but you’d already be in a contract and there’d be nothing you could do about it,” said Megan Spurrell, a freshman majoring in communication and music industry. “You’d be forced to get what you get.”
Delays were also a concern for students.
“They’re promising, but you can never guarantee with construction,” said Nicole Berkanslar, a sophomore majoring in international relations global business. “Something could go wrong and then it takes another year,” But Burton said there is no reason the building shouldn’t finish on time.
The building is expected to be complete on June 30, at which point the apartments will be ready. The retail space, however, will not be finished.
Hrovat and Burton both said they expect the building to be fully leased by the time it opens.
“The student population that is our target market moves just about every year, and the project that we’re building — being sort of the newest, nicest game in town — I know will get a very, very high level of interest,” Hrovat said.

Students are taking preventative measures in light of the recent armed robbery that occurred at an off-campus apartment Thursday, but Los Angeles Police Department officials say there is no real need for concern.
Though many students living in the area of 29th Street — where Thursday’s robbery occurred — said they still feel the neighborhood is safe, many added that they are taking additional safety measures.
Chris Farro, who lives in the building where the robbery occurred, said that his landlord installed bars on all the windows in the complex Saturday.
“I don’t think they’re going to come back or anything, but we’ve been a lot better about locking our own rooms,” said Farro, a junior majoring in business administration. “I also just got renter’s insurance.”
Other students are taking similar precautions.
Michael Scott, a junior majoring in computer engineering who lives on 29th between Orchard Avenue and Hoover Street, said he thinks the neighborhood is safe because it is regularly patrolled by USC’s Department of Public Safety. Scott added, however, that he plans to take extra safety measures.
Scott said before the robbery he had casually asked his landlord to put bars on the windows, but now he intends to make sure it happens.
“It has made me want to push my landlord to put bars on sooner,” Scott said.
Megan Dickey, who lives on 29th and Hoover, said she is locking her bedroom door at night as an extra security measure.
“When we heard about [the robbery], one of my other roommates said we need to make sure that our doors are locked at all times,” said Dickey, a junior majoring in broadcast journalism.
Though LAPD officials said they are encouraging students to take these precautions, they believe Thursday’s robbery was an isolated incident.
Because they think the robbery was a one-time incident, LAPD said they advised DPS not to issue a crime report.
Capt. Art Miller of LAPD’s southwest division said LAPD officials did not think it was necessary to raise concerns among members of the USC community.
“I think it sends the wrong message,” Miller said of a crime report. “It sends the message that there are some suspects out there running rampant and doing home invasions, and that’s not the case.”
Though LAPD is still investigating the robbery, Miller said its unique circumstances have led officials to believe there is little risk of a repeat crime.
“There’s nothing in terms of this being a serial type incident,” Miller said. “If it occurred as alleged, it was probably a one-time deal.”
LAPD officials will continue to investigate the crime and will be re-interviewing the victims, Miller said. He said he could not put a time frame on the investigation, but noted residents in the area have little to be concerned about, even though no arrest has been made.
“I would say that I would not worry about it, but at the same time, I wouldn’t let my guard down on the normal activities of my life,” Miller said.
Miller suggested residents continue to lock their doors and windows and take other basic safety measures.
Though no crime alert was issued, fliers with tips on preventing home invasion were distributed to residents in the neighborhood.
“It was just a bunch of tips like, ‘Have really good locks,’” Dickey said. “I saw them all down Menlo, on cars and on 29th. It was all just common sense, nothing that I hadn’t thought of already.”
Alex Norby, who lives on 29th and Hoover, said he thinks it’s good for students to be aware and take precautions.
“I think generally most of us feel safe because we hear about stuff happening in the papers, but we don’t actually experience it. The closer you are, the more you react to it,” said Norby, a sophomore majoring in business administration (cinema-television). “Most freshman live on campus, and when they move over here they don’t realize we don’t live on campus anymore.”

While universities nationwide admitted fewer international graduate students than last year, USC bucked the trend by significantly increasing it’s international graduate admissions rate.
On average, US graduate schools saw a 3 percent decrease in international student admissions — the first decrease since 2004, according to a Council of Graduate Schools report released this month.
Meanwhile, USC, which has the largest international graduate student population of any school in the country, saw a 13.7 percent spike in their admissions of international graduate students. The university currently enrolls graduate students from 114 different countries and international students account for more than a quarter of all graduate students at USC, according to the USC International Student Enrollment Report for 2008-2009.
According to CGS, the nationwide drop in international graduate student admissions comes at a time when application rates are not growing as quickly as they were prior to 2005.
One reason for the slowing growth may be the tough global economy, said Stuart Heiser, manager of government relations and external affairs for CGS. Heiser said some international students may be finding it difficult to afford undergraduate education in their home countries, so graduate education is no longer an option for them.
The largest drop in admissions to US graduate schools — 16 percent — occurred in students from India and South Korea, where finding loans has become increasingly difficult for prospective students, Heiser said.
Some countries, however, were immune to the drop. Graduate applications from China, for example, were up 14 percent from last year and admissions rates went up 13 percent.
Chansuk Jung, a first-year graduate student from South Korea, said he thinks the global economy isn’t affecting USC because students who apply to the university aren’t necessarily worried about finances.
He said he came to USC because he wanted to be in California, where a large percentage of Chinese and South Koreans who move to the US end up living. Jung said he was familiar with the university’s reputation, before he came to the US.
Katharine Harrington, the USC dean of admissions and financial aid, said she thought the importance the university has placed on bettering its
international presence has helped admissions rates continue to rise in light of the national drop.
“[The university] has made a significant commitment to maintaining an international presence,” Harrington said.
Harrington cited the university’s international offices as an example. Currently, USC has offices in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Mexico and Shanghai, with two more offices — one in India and one in South Korea — set to open later this academic year, according to a press release.
Krati Ahuja, a first-year graduate student from India studying computer science, said she came to USC because of its reputation.
“The school of engineering is very well-known and very reputable,” she said.
Jean Morrison, vice provost for academic affairs and graduate programs, said she thinks one possibility for the drop in admissions nationwide may be because of competition from graduate schools in other countries  that have started recruiting aggressively for international students.
But USC, Morrison said, has always outperformed other US universities in going after the best international students. She said she thinks that’s why its international admissions rates continued to rise.
“It’s a competitive market, and I think we have the structures in place to compete very effectively,” she said.

The wildfires razing northeast Los Angeles — faintly visible from campus rooftops and balconies — continue to spread, forcing mandatory evacuations and threatening the homes and families of some USC students.
Firefighters battling three-digit temperatures, 80-foot flames and more than 35,000 acres of fire had only contained 5 percent of the blaze by 4 p.m. Sunday, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.

As of Sunday evening, LAFD officials had recommended evacuation in the cities of Altadena, Acton, La Crescenta, La Cañada Flintridge and parts of Glendale, and access to Highway 14 has been restricted in multiple parts of the area, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said.
The Station fire, which has been burning since Aug. 26, is not expected to be under control until Sept. 8 at the earliest, according to LAFD estimates.
Although the fire has stayed 20 miles northeast of campus, USC students with homes and families in the evacuation areas are concerned about the potential effects of the fires.
Nicolas Moura, a junior majoring in trombone performance, said his family has loaded cars in case of evacuation. From his home in the mountains of La Cañada, Moura said the sound of the firefighters battling the blaze was “like a warzone.”
“From my house we have a pretty good view of the fires,” Moura said. “I’ve never experienced fires this bad.”
Moura first heard about the fire when he was going home to celebrate his parents’ 30th wedding anniversary.
“We were watching it at the dinner table — ‘La Cañada is on fire,’” Moura said. “It was difficult to get food for the dinner.”
Sean Perry, a junior majoring in economics, grew up in Altadena, where a mandatory evacuation has been imposed.
“My home is about five miles from the fire’s present location, so I’m not particularly worried about my own house,” Perry said. “But of course I’m worried for the community.”
Perry, a member of the USC cycling team, said although he lives near campus, the smoky air from the fires has still affected his training.
“I haven’t been able to ride in a week because it’ll destroy your lungs,” Perry said.
The LAFD has launched an ongoing investigation to determine the cause of the fire.
Additional support, including eight air tankers, 12 helicopters and a Canadian Super Scooper — a massive water tanker — should arrive by Tuesday, LAFD said.
