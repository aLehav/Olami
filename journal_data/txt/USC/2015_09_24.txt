A recent incident of racism directed at Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath —  in which an undisclosed fraternity member hurled a drink at her and yelled, “You Indian piece of sh*t!” — and her subsequent Facebook post about it, have led to larger discussions of race relations on campus.
Many of the comments on the status, which was posted Sunday and has since accrued almost 10,000 likes and 1,500 shares, were students sharing similar experiences of discrimination they have had at USC.
Members of the USC community say it has brought to light an issue that has long existed here in the shadows on campus.
At a fraternity tailgate this month, Buck Andrews, a sophomore majoring in communication and a member of the greek community, said he and a friend were both called a “f*g” and asked to leave the event. Like the incident with Sampath, the house has since apologized, but Andrews says it is indicative of a persistent and widespread issue of discrimination both at USC and within the greek system.
“It’s an epidemic on the Row that is now being talked about openly,” he said. “I think Rini’s experience was just so traumatic and horrible, but now it’s finally opening up opportunities for people to speak out.”
For some, the discrimination has been bad enough to prompt them to leave the university altogether. Corey Walker, a black former USC student, says he was continually discriminated at the University based on his race, specifically during encounters with those in the greek system.
“I was walking down the Row with two other black people and heard a girl say, ‘Why are there so many n*gg*rs on the Row?’” he said. “What happened to the president is not an uncommon thing — if you ask [members of the greek community], they’ll tell you they’re not racist but the way they treat you is completely different.”
Walker relayed other similar instances of discrimination. When he was in attendance at a fraternity party, he said someone asked, “Who put a black guy on the list?’”
He transferred to the University of Michigan this past semester, citing that his status as a member of the black community never made him feel comfortable on campus.
“It was so emotionally draining being a part of that university,” he said.
The incident with Sampath has sparked a strong response from the IFC, which has worked to separate themselves from the actions of the individual fraternity member. Interfraternity Council President Jake Simon spoke out against the member’s behavior involved in the Sampath incident and said the IFC would work to combat future instances.
“Intolerance and bigotry are tragic realities of the world we live in, but it is the ardent goal of the Interfraternity Council to purge this hatred from our community,” Simon wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “The Interfraternity Council hopes to contribute any resources and efforts that it can to meaningful discussion and contributing towards [sic] the action that comes from this dialogue.”
The member has since been evicted and suspended from the fraternity.
Though last Sunday’s incident sparked campus-wide discussion, the administration and USG are looking into ways to reverse the tide on a now crippling perception: that the University is a discriminatory one.
In the 2014-2015 school year, for which numbers are most recently available, the University reported the student population was 33 percent white. Asians and African Americans are 18 percent and 5 percent, respectively, while international students make up 23 percent.
USC administration has said the numbers are indicative of an open campus, but also one more susceptible to types of discrimination.
“In many ways, we are one of the most diverse universities in the world,” said Varun Soni, dean of religious life and the de facto administration spokesman regarding the Sampath incident. “There are a lot of great opportunities with that kind of diversity, but there are also a lot of challenges, and I think it’s a shared responsibility of all of us to create a campus climate that we can all be proud of.”
Soni’s call to action echoed a similar plea by Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry in a letter written to the USC community on Tuesday and co-signed by Sampath.
“We must confront hateful speech by condemning it as a united community,” he wrote. “But such a reaction is only possible when students speak up.”
Next Wednesday, USG will be holding an open forum, “Voice of USC: The Diversity Climate on our Campus,” for members of the USC community to express their thoughts regarding the issue of racism and other discriminatory behavior at the University. They hope from thoughts and stories shared there they can formulate a future action plan.
The organization acknowledges, however, that changes won’t be sudden.
“It’s going to be hard,” said Alec White, a USG residential senator. “You can change the rules, but you can’t change an ingrained culture overnight.”

President C. L. Max Nikias was one of four recipients of the Academic Leadership Award from the Carnegie Corporation of New York on Thursday for his vision and commitment to the University and excellence in administration.
Founded by industrialist Andrew Carnegie in 1911, the Carnegie Corporation of New York pursues issues that Carnegie believed had great importance — primarily education.
“This award recognizes some exemplary leaders of those institutions, who embody the best qualities of leadership — not merely managerial skills, but institutional vision and an abiding commitment to high quality, diversity, curricular innovation and investment in their communities,” said Vartan Gregorian, president of Carnegie Corporation of New York, in a press release. “I am extremely proud to count this year’s recipients among the 20 college and university presidents the corporation has honored with the Academic Leadership Award over the past 10 years.”
This award is given every two years. Along with the award, the Carnegie Corporation of New York will provide $500,000 toward Nikias’s academic advances. These advances include his fundraising of $300 million last year for merit-based financial aid and construction projects, namely the Village at USC, investing in biomedical research and renowned faculty and expanding USC’s international outreach.
“I am deeply humbled to receive this prestigious recognition, which I accept on behalf of our entire university community,” said Nikias in a statement to USC News. “I take great pride in all that the Trojan Family has achieved together, be it through widening access for deserving students, recruiting transformative faculty or engaging with the communities that surround our two campuses.”
Nikias has been with USC since 1991, when he started as a professor of electrical engineering and classics and eventually moved up to dean, provost and, now,  president.
Nikias says he already plans to fund the USC Neighborhood Academic Initiative and the Global and Discovery Scholars program. NAI is a college preparation program for underprivileged high school and lower-grade school students, who, if they complete the program and decide to attend USC, receive 4.5-years worth of financial aid. Students meet from 7:30 to 9:30 a.m. for specialized classes taught by their schools’ teachers. USC NAI works with students and families to make sure that they end up receiving a degree.
“This award reminds us that our work can make a lasting difference, and inspires us to remain focused on the responsibilities of a global research university,” Nikias said.
Ronald J. Daniels of Johns Hopkins University, Patricia A. McGuire of Trinity Washington University and Diana Natalicio of the University of Texas at El Paso also won the award.

Two senior administrators in the Office of the Provost, Anthony Bailey and Ainsley Carry have been promoted to vice presidents, Provost Michael Quick announced in a statement Wednesday.
Bailey will serve as vice president for Strategic and Global Initiatives and Carry will serve as vice president for Student Affairs. They previously served as vice provost for Global Initiatives and vice provost for Student Affairs, respectively.
“Since joining the provost’s office, Anthony Bailey has overseen the development of several initiatives that increase USC’s global reputation and impact,” Quick said in the statement.
Bailey was instrumental in the launch of the USC International Academy and helped expand USC’s global reach, particularly in Latin America. Prior to his appointment at USC, Bailey worked for Kaplan, Inc. in the Latin American region.
Carry came to USC in 2013 from Auburn University where he also served as vice president for Student Affairs. He has previously held positions at the University of Arkansas, Temple University, Southern Methodist University and the University of Florida.
“[Carry] has provided more direct channels for students seeking support services, increased campus security measures and awareness programs, and integrated academic advising with our career center to provide more focused pathways for students once they graduate,” Quick said in the statement.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Carry said he was pleased with the promotion. He said his predecessor, Michael L. Jackson, had the title vice president for Student Affairs. In an effort to strengthen the connection between Student Affairs and Academic Affairs, Carry was given the title vice provost when he first joined USC.
“Now we feel pretty confident about that connection, so the current provost thought it would be appropriate to give Student Affairs the scope and responsibility it needs,” Carry said.
Carry said he will continue working on many of the initiatives he was a part of as vice provost including student safety, health and wellness initiatives and  campus and student engagement.

Last time the Trojans were in Tempe, Arizona, they suffered a blowout loss so bad that Athletic Director Pat Haden had no choice but to fire struggling head coach Lane Kiffin.
When the USC hosted the Sun Devils last season, many thought it would redeem the previous season’s loss, but instead  the game ended in yet another loss for the Trojans, 38-34, after a last second Hail Mary sealed the deal for Arizona State.
On Saturday, the No. 19 Trojans will return to Tempe, this time with two losses to avenge. Not only that, but after last week’s loss to Stanford, the Trojans are in a must-win situation facing a Pac-12 South opponent.
“We have a tough road ahead next week against ASU,” said redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler after last Saturday’s game. “This is the turning point in the season that can define us. It depends how the team can respond to adversity.”
Both teams enter this week’s matchup with 2-1 records. USC cruised to a 2-0 record with wins against Arkansas State and Idaho, outscoring their opponents 114-15.
It wasn’t until last week’s loss to Stanford that the Trojans showed any signs of weakness. USC’s defense seemed to be its Achilles’ heel after allowing the Cardinal to rack up almost 500 yards in total offense.
Kessler entered the season as a Heisman hopeful and has lived up to the hype.
Unfortunately for Kessler, his team, especially his defense, have not. Kessler has thrown 10 touchdown passes in three games and no interceptions. He has completed at least 73 percent of his passes in every game and has 922 yards on the season as he continues his Heisman Trophy campaign.
Sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster has assumed the role of No. 1 receiver and has not disappointed.
He has 434 yards on 22 receptions and four touchdowns already this season and leads all Power five conference teams in receiving yards and is second in catches.
Redshirt senior tailback Tre Madden, who is expected to play on Saturday night after suffering a calf strain against Stanford, is leading an invigorated run game.
“Tre looked great [today] … I feel very confident he’ll play and be a quality player for us Saturday night,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said after Thursday’s practice.
Senior center Max Tuerk heads a powerful offensive line that has done a better job of protecting Kessler since its first game.     Though the offense certainly needs to improve on third down conversions, the defense will need to make vast adjustments to end ASU’s streak.
“We have to get back up and go on the road at Arizona State and fix the things that need to be fixed and get a win in the South division,” Sarkisian said.
While the Trojans have cooled off since the start of the season, ASU has been steadily improving since its season opening loss to Texas A&M. In week two, the Sun Devils rebounded with a win over Cal Poly.
Last week, senior quarterback Mike Bercovici passed for 317 yards and three touchdowns in a 34-10 win over New Mexico. He also had a rushing touchdown against New Mexico, displaying his versatility and mobility, something Stanford quarterback Kevin Hogan used to silence the Trojan defense.
“We have to do a good job as leaders of this program so that we don’t lay in the weeds [saying], ‘Woe is me,’” Sarkisian said.
Last time Bercovici faced USC, he replaced injured starter Taylor Kelly and passed for 510 yards against a tired Trojan defense.
Bercovici’s play earned him the starting job this season, and he will look to repeat his performance this Saturday.
“I want our defense to be aggressive, fast, opportunistic, creating turnovers, getting our hands on the ball, playing with a chip on their shoulder,” Sarkisian said.
Two great quarterbacks will lead to dynamic Pac-12 offenses, and the difference in the game will likely come down to which defense can apply the most pressure to the opposing quarterback.
Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m. in Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona. It will be broadcast live on ESPN.
“I’m excited by the fact that we are eager to get back on the field,  and I think that’s a great mentality to have after a tough loss,” Sarkisian said.

The USC women’s soccer team is set to open Pac-12 play against Oregon State at McAlister Field Saturday.
The Women of Troy are undefeated in their past four games and have a lot of momentum as they prepare for the conference opener.
Not only does the team boast a 5-3-1 record, but it has also simply dominated its in-state competition thus far. The Women of Troy recorded wins against UC Riverside, San Diego, the University of the Pacific and St. Mary’s.
After a goalless draw against Long Beach, head coach Keidane McAlpine noted that his team was playing cerebral, fundamentally sound soccer but needed a goal-scoring spark.
“We’re looking for that one person who wants to take the reins and be the woman to win games for us,” McAlpine said.
Several of McAlpine’s players have stepped up and embraced the team-on-my-back mindset.
Since the 0-0 tie, the team has played two games, scoring five goals and conceding just one in the process. By playing a possession-oriented style, this team has the ability to dictate the pace of the game.
USC’s outstanding play in central midfield has been crucial to the team’s success. It is simply impossible to control the flow of play without having intelligent movement, accurate passing and diligent defending from the center midfielders.
Morgan Andrews and Nicole Molen have impressed this season, while the industrious Sydney Sladek continues to pose problems for opposing defenses.
Behind this midfield engine, the Women of Troy have enjoyed a goal-scoring explosion as of late.
Mandy Freeman, a junior from Royal Palm Beach, Florida, scored her first career goal for the Women of Troy in the 2-0 victory over St. Mary’s. Andrews, meanwhile, converted a pair of penalty kicks against the University of the Pacific in a 3-1 win.
As the team returns home for the Oregon State showdown, the need to preserve home-field advantage becomes an added variable.
“We don’t want to disappoint the Trojan fans that come out during the middle of the day to support us,” Freeman said.
Saturday’s contest should prove to be a well-contested affair, as the Beavers got off to a flying start this season after winning four of their first five games. Like USC, Oregon State is stingy on defense and has played in a number of low-scoring games this season.
This fixture is significant not only because of the importance of winning intra-conference games, but also because the Beavers appear to be knocking on the door of the NSCAA top-25 rankings just as the Women of Troy are.
There is little margin for error in the competitive Pac-12 Conference. Stanford, Washington and Arizona are all accounted for in the top 25 at the moment, and the Women of Troy will get a shot at all three throughout the course of the season.
In the short term, though, the team’s focus is on Oregon State. The opponent may be solid, but the Women of Troy are gelling as the halfway mark of the season approaches.
The back line has been stout, and goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme has only allowed six goals in nine matches.
This matchup does not figure to be a shootout, though, according to McAlpine, who also said that there might only be one goal in this game. But, the chess match will be beyond fascinating.
McAlpine has done a masterful job with his tactics and has become to be known as an expert when it comes to ensuring that the opposition can never establish a rhythm. However, he also knows that the finishing in front of goal will be crucial.
“I think sometimes you lose your focus, you get excited, you lose your patience,” McAlpine said
With possession of the ball and calmness in front of goal, USC will have a real opportunity to challenge a talented Oregon State team.
This Saturday is just the beginning of Pac-12 play, though, as away games against Washington State and Washington sit on the horizon.

The Sun Devils have Steve Sarkisian’s number — he’s 0-4 all-time against the program as a head coach.
Historically, Arizona State has averaged almost 35 points a game against Sarkisian’s teams, both at USC and Washington. USC defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox was only around for two of those losses.
Ironically, though, the Sun Devils posted the highest amount of points (53) against a Sarkisian-coached team in one of the games where Wilcox was calling the shots on defense.
Now, after dropping their Pac-12 opener to Stanford, the Trojans are forced to quickly turn around to face their first road test of the season in a hostile environment at Arizona State — a program that has not only gotten the best of USC the past couple of seasons, but also its head coach and defensive coordinator.
Great timing, right.
The Trojans aren’t in uncharted waters, though. The program has notched its first loss of the season in week three or earlier for each of the three past seasons — two of those losses coming in conference openers.
USC came into each of these games as double-digit favorites and failed to take care of business. Looking at the glass half full, though, losing so early in the season could prove to be beneficial for Sarkisian’s team because it creates a sense of urgency for the team a little sooner than most expected.
Contrary to my earlier prediction, Stanford came out to the Coliseum and not only tested the Trojans, but straight up bullied USC, while exposing holes and weaknesses in their defense in the meantime.
Justin Wilcox, you are the weakest link … for now. After allowing 41 points and over 470 yards of total offense, Wilcox’s unit can’t afford to get torched this time around and, quite frankly, it shouldn’t.
This year’s Sun Devils team is not the same offensive juggernaut it has been in years past, as it currently finds itself in the bottom-half of the FBS and Pac-12 in scoring — they’re averaging a little more than 28 points per game, while facing below-average opponents like Cal Poly and New Mexico. The only legitimate team they’ve faced so far was Texas A&M and the Sun Devils were only able to post 17 points against the Aggies.
Last year’s Arizona State teams averaged just under 37 points per game, which was good enough for 17th overall in the FBS and third in the Pac-12.
Arizona State’s offensive woes can be largely attributed to its offensive line’s struggles to protect quarterback Mike Bercovici in the pocket. Through just three games, the unit has allowed 11 sacks with nine of those coming against Texas A & M.
Hopefully, Wilcox gets the memo.
College football is a game of fine tuning and making adjustments week in and week out, but at face value, it doesn’t appear to be rocket science.
If you’re able to get pressure on Bercovici and give him a hard time, it could be a long day for the Sun Devils. It would also take a little bit of pressure off the young USC secondary, which struggled against Stanford.
Wilcox can theoretically kill two birds with one stone.
But if the defense allows Bercovici time to make plays, he is capable of posting monster numbers like the 510 yards and five touchdowns he put up against USC last season — not to mention the 46-yard “Jael Marry” he threw to win the game and break the hearts of every USC fan.
If USC is going to win, Wilcox needs to dial up more blitzes and pressure. We saw what happened last week when the defense couldn’t get to Hogan — they made him look like a god out there, while being unable to force any turnovers.
In fact, the Trojans haven’t been able to come up with any turnovers since forcing four in their opener against Arkansas State. Going on the road for the first time, it’s paramount that USC musters up at least one turnover to gain some momentum and try to take the crowd out of the game.
It’s going to be hot on Saturday night in Tempe with an expected temperature in the mid-90s around kickoff, and for Wilcox’s sake, I sure do hope that the USC defense comes out firing on all cylinders.
This game not only has the potential to be a great turnaround victory for the Trojans, but it would also give Sarkisian his first ever win against Arizona State, and perhaps provide a boost to Wilcox’s morale should the defense be able to bounce back.
A victory would also signify much-needed retribution for USC fans who’ve been haunted by memories of last year’s game against a school, whose acceptance rate is so high that not even Cody Kessler’s completion percentage (78.7 percent) — among the best in college football — can match it.
If the Sun Devils are somehow able to post 60-plus points like it did two years ago and upset USC for the third consecutive time, however, Sarkisian should just leave Wilcox behind at the airport.

Though the ambience might be similar to sister restaurant B.S. Taqueria, Broken Spanish offers a fine dining alternative for Mexican fusion food lovers. Potted plants and the abundance of wooden furniture give the restaurant a homey, welcoming vibe that makes the experience feel like an upscale dinner party.
The restaurant feels open and airy even though it is extremely dimly lit. Patrons have to make do with the flickering light from the lone candle on the table to make out the small letters on the menu. Be prepared to resort to external lighting from bright cell phone screens.
A pottery shelf, a cabinet of curios and a wall collection of black and white photographs add a considerable amount of quirkiness to the experience, echoing the concept of B.S. Taqueria.
A pre-dinner drink comes in a cazuela earthen dish garnished with citrus fruit slices and flowers. The drink, also named Cazuela ($20), is meant to serve up to two people in a adult-style milkshake-sharing fashion — though it is considerably stronger than what you might have had as a kid. With a blanco tequila base mixed with mezcal, mandarin napoleon, lime, fresh jicama and pineapple with a dash of fresno chili, Cazeula kick starts a meal in an exciting and refreshing way.
Dinner is a tapas-style affair, and the lamb neck tamales with king oyster mushrooms and Queso Oaxaca ($15) starts off the meal nicely. The tamales come in a steel pan, covered in chunks of lamb and a sprinkling of cheese. They are slightly crispy on the outside and wonderfully moist on the inside, and the tender strips of lamb neck are well-seasoned with just a hint of spiciness and a kick of fresh cilantro. The cheese gives each bite a slight creaminess that rounds off the dish nicely without overpowering the other flavors.
Next is the Chile Relleno ($13), featuring a fresh poblano pepper stuffed with potato, kale and lemon, roasted and then smothered in soubise sauce. The sweet pepper casing combined with the hearty stuffing is a wonderful combination, and the onion-based soubise decorates the dish with a richness that is surprising but welcome. The poblano is very mild, and the heat kicks in only after your taste buds register all the other different flavors in the dish. The soubise’s flavor is not too heavy but could benefit from a bit less seasoning as it is slightly too salty.
The last dish of the night, and inexplicably the largest among the three, is the chicharron ($34), a mouthwatering hunk of crispy pork belly served in a moat of citrus sauce with elephant garlic mojo, garnished with a garden of radish sprouts and pickled herbs. A bite of this dish tastes just like a bite of bacon. The pork belly is extremely tender; it is firm yet falls apart with the lightest touch, and the tangy, slightly spicy soup that soaks into the meat cuts through the richness of the fatty belly to balance out the textures. There is a slight nutty flavor to the meat, thanks to the crispy skin that may or may not be the best part.
The tab reflected the quality of the meal, but it was worth every penny. Broken Spanish takes a step into the modern Mexican food takeover on the restaurant front and proves to be a worthy companion to B.S. Taqueria.

Roland Emmerich’s Stonewall is not about the Stonewall Riots.
The movie might claim to support LGBTQ rights, but does little to show this. At its core, this film is a campy take on a coming-of-age story of clean-cut, small-town boy Danny (Jeremy Irvine). Irvine, in this role, fails to captivate the audience. If possible, Irvine’s uninspiring performance makes the character even more unsympathetic and boring than the film’s writer, Jon Robin Baitz, probably intended.
The story leads up to the revolutionary Stonewall riots, the historical demonstrations on June 28, 1969, which is often considered the catalyst for the gay liberation movement. Though the actual riots marked one of the most important events in LGBTQ history, Stonewall has one of the most treacle openers. Danny is emotionally abused by his crush, football star Joe Altman, played by an expressionless Karl Glusman. Then, Danny is thrown out after being caught in the act with Joe by his narrow-minded and angry football coach of a father, played by David Cubitt. In response, Danny decides to go to New York City, where he would have gone anyway because he coincidentally has a scholarship to Columbia University. Danny also has a spunky little sister whose role in this movie is trivialized because her sole purpose is to idolize Danny and ask him to get Andy Warhol’s signature.
While immersing himself in “colorful” city life, Danny meets a mature, older man, Trevor (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who spends the entire movie trying desperately to smolder. He also hangs out with other diverse people, including Ray/Ramona (Jonny Beauchamp), a character partially inspired by transgender activist Sylvia Rivera. Ray’s huge crush on Danny is a recurring source of cruelty throughout the film. Danny’s rejection of Ray is the final blow. Ray is made into a perpetual victim who is obsessed with Danny’s All-American wholesomeness, The only other member of the group who is memorable is Cong, who has minimal lines and steals things. Everyone else, including famous gay liberation activist Marsha P. Johnson, is an afterthought.
There are several other things that are notably missing in this film. Respectful representations of the LGBTQ community and historical relevance are all lacking. In fact, it’s just plain hard to understand why Emmerich would fight so hard for this film. The sloppiness of Baitz’s writing is confusing. The subtext behind the script conveys the message that any LGBTQ person who is not white and doesn’t look conventionally male and straight is undesirable and frightening. The film also depicts trans-people as being obnoxious. The one lesbian character is portrayed as hysterical and undermining to the cause. When present, the other women in the film are static characters and seem to be uncomfortable with actually speaking. Gay men who are not Danny or his love interests are portrayed as disgusting and pathetic. There is an uneasy parallel in their attraction to Danny that is comparable to the way in which gay men were traditionally portrayed as fantasizing about straight men.
In short, Stonewall has managed to vilify the very thing that the film and the historical event itself were trying to glorify. Danny’s disdain and fear of people who are not white and gay is horrifying. Danny’s reluctance to be associated with anything in the movement, unless white men are involved, points to Emmerich’s whitewashing of this film. Even more uncomfortable is the fetishization of the non-white characters who aren’t gay in an “acceptable” way. Often Danny’s newfound friends are reduced to one-liners and flashes of flamboyant costume. This kind of treatment of characters is as callous as the cruelties that are dealt out by society.
This is by no means the only account of the actual events at Stonewall, but it is a high-profile film. With this, there comes a responsibility that comes with depicting a historical event that’s up there with Seneca Falls and Selma. This film, which set out to represent a moment of pride in the LGBTQ community, went so wrong. It narrowly focuses on the rights of white, gay, cisgender men. In one scene, Trevor makes Marsha  P. Johnson move from the jukebox so he can change the song into his choice, “A Whiter Shade of Pale.” In the making of this film, transgender people were not only marginalized in front but also behind the camera. The blow is even harder because the film wraps itself in a blanket of good intentions. Hopefully, this movie will at least shed light on the systems of privilege and prejudice in the queer community. Ultimately, without the backdrop and name of Stonewall, this film would just be a mediocre teen movie.

Since 1982, more than 11,300 books have been challenged in schools, bookstores and libraries. These books include world-renowned and highly influential classics. Some of the novels that have been banned throughout history do not surprise me, particularly those that carry heavy political undertones and critiques, such as Catch-22, Animal Farm and Brave New World. However, some of the others are less obvious. I was surprised to find out that some of my favorite novels, such as The Grapes of Wrath, Alice in Wonderland, The Catcher in the Rye and Gone With The Wind, have been banned by various governments and governing bodies. After thinking about it for a while, however, I realized that this made perfect sense. A good book will challenge its readers’ opinions and prejudices. It will often provoke and shock. It will critique the social order and showcase the truth of life in certain cultures and under certain regimes. Of course, by taking these risks, authors will inevitably make a few enemies. Therefore, in honor of the upcoming National Banned Books Week, I’d like to celebrate various books I love that have been banned.
A lot of novels are banned in schools because of their sexual content or profanity. Of course, this is often used as a superficial reason to strike something from the syllabus when the real reason might be more complex. One of my all-time favorite books, In Cold Blood, was banned in an Advanced Placement English class in Georgia in 1966 due to a parent’s complaint regarding the sexual and violent components of the novel, as well as the profanity. What surprised me about this book’s banning was that it was part of an AP English syllabus. Students in these programs are clearly devoted to literature and are at a mature age. It is almost impossible to find a book that has not one curse word, no sexual intonation or violence that is not one written for infants. I loved the realism of In Cold Blood and compared to some of the other books on this list, it is relatively inoffensive. It is simply a gripping thriller, which also explores the human psyche in a poetic and elegant manner.
Another novel banned in schools and libraries across the nation is The Catcher In The Rye, for similar reasons to In Cold Blood. Throughout the 1950s in particular, it was labeled “filthy” and “blasphemous,” among other things. What I think is so absurd about banning this novel is that it is such an iconic American novel, one that defines the country’s cultural and literary landscape. One school or library ban will never stop people from reading it, as it is such a central part of America’s civilization that to ban it is to ignore a part of one’s own literary heritage. I understand why parents complain about certain books and why schools decide to ban them. After all, many adults want to protect and hide children and teenagers from the reality of the world for as long as possible. However, it is important to acknowledge that we are constantly bombarded by sexual and violent content in the media and in our everyday lives. Banning books does nothing to prevent this, and there is a difference between a fantastic work of literature that acknowledges human nature and this other banal content.
It isn’t just schools and libraries that ban books. Animal Farm was banned by the Soviet Union immediately after its publication in 1945 due to its thinly veiled criticism of communist values and practices. This is somewhat unsurprising, as the USSR was an extreme regime in which there was high censorship, and many other books were also banned. What is more shocking, in my opinion, is the fact that The Grapes of Wrath was banned in several parts of America, including California, due to its unflattering portrayal of the state. This took me aback not only because of the fact that this is again, one of America’s great novels, but also because America is not a dictatorship and should not have such strict censorship. This happens to be my all-time favorite book, and its beauty and power are the best showcase of this time in America’s history. To  disregard the book completely is absurd.
In the end, this is what I love about books. I love that they have something to say and that they have a purpose. They educate us about cultures and time periods, and they also open our eyes and minds to issues and ideas that we may have been ignorant of before. Most importantly, they do this with elegance, with beauty and in a way which is pleasurable to the reader. They tell us a story and enchant us, unlike any other medium really can. So, my advice to the reader is read as many books possible. Read books that have been banned and try to figure out why they were banned. What is it about this piece of literature that someone was too embarrassed or scared to let other people read? More often than not, the books that are banned are some of the most powerful and influential novels in existence, so try one of these banned books next week and see if you think they live up to their prohibited status.

As the old saying goes, one step forward, two steps back.
When USC elected Rini Sampath and Jordan Fowler to lead the Undergraduate Student Government as the first all-female president and vice president ticket back in April, it appeared the University had taken a huge step in the right direction toward progress. Not only were they the first all-female ticket to be elected in Pac-12 history, but they were both women of color.
Despite these historic achievements, recent events highlight the fact that more must be done to achieve an inclusive campus for all members of the Trojan Family.
Last weekend, Sampath wrote a Facebook post recalling an incident at a fraternity house where a member called her an “Indian piece of sh*t” and threw a drink at her. Sampath has said she will take this opportunity to channel her efforts toward addressing racism at USC, whereas the University has been notably less responsive.
If the University is to truly confront the issue of racism at USC, it needs a strong administrative statement.
It took two days for the University to respond to the attack on its student body president. Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry sent an email to the campus community which, though affirming that “there is no place at USC for intolerance and bigotry,” provided a solution in the form of redirecting students to a website to report incidents of bias. This letter was also published as an advertisement in the Daily Trojan. The fact that the response only came after Sampath’s post had garnered significant publicity also signals that it might have been a PR move to show support rather than an actual call for institutional change. And despite the language of support, administration response in the form of policy changes has been lackluster.
The University must make a bold move to finally ensure the safety of Asian Pacific American students, as well as students of all other minority groups, on campus. More specifically, it must create a vice president for equity, diversity and inclusion modeled after similar positions at UCLA and UCSD.
Moving diversity issues out of the current hierarchy of student affairs would indicate that fostering diversity and inclusion is a priority to the University and that diversity is more than just a core value or an abstract ideal.
Creating a vice president for equity, diversity and inclusion would also group together crucial services for minorities on campus — such as cultural centers, the Center for Women and Men and the LGBT resource center — and allow these resources to move out of separate sub-departments of Student Affairs and instead to a higher office which would allow for less red tape and the implementation of more important student programs to foster a climate of inclusion.
The University announced on Wednesday that administrators Anthony Bailey and Ainsley Carry were promoted to vice president of strategic and global initiatives and of student affairs, respectively. In the press release, the University stated that this action is indicative of “the expanded role their respective units play within the overall framework of the University.”
Since USC has already implemented two vice presidential roles and acknowledged the significance the departments they manage, in lieu of recent events, it seems to be the next logical step to create a vice president for equity, diversity and inclusion.
The incident with Sampath has made it abundantly clear that if any area of student affairs deserves an expanded role in the university administration, it is equity, diversity and inclusion. If USC is truly proud of our diversity and committed to forming a global community, then we need to give this issue the administrative recognition that it deserves.

Amid a prolonged effort to increase transparency for sexual assault on college campuses, Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton released a rough proposal to combat sexual assault last Monday in Iowa. The plan, which encourages implementing a sexual assault survivor network, increasing support, instituting procedures for treatment of the accused and enlarging existing programs, should inspire more concrete changes that directly address sexual assault here at USC.
Though Clinton’s plan is set in a political context, there’s no need for party politics in this discussion. The process by which policymakers and administrators tackle this issue should begin with the notion to not simply condemn the attackers and their assault, but to focus all efforts on ceasing it in its entirety. This is not a conversation that divides, but one that brings individuals together. There is a common sense of disdain for the increasing number of college students who report that they have undergone forced or unwarranted sexual acts, yet have failed to report their experience.
Last spring, USC administrators began their movement against sexual assault with the “Think About It”  series. In conjunction with these efforts, USC and 26 other American universities participated in the Association of American Universities’ Campus Climate Survey. On Monday, USC Provost Michael Quick and Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry released a comprehensive letter with USC’s troubling results.
For undergraduate students and graduate students, there was a stark contrast among reported responses for sexual assault. According to the report, approximately 66 percent of female and 45 percent of male undergraduate students have experienced sexual harassment. Most unsettlingly, however, was that 76 percent of females and 70 percent of males believed that their involvement in sexual assault was not serious enough to report. These results reveal a shocking ineffectiveness of sexual assault education programs on campus, which should inform students of acts considered as assault.
USC must recognize that most sexual assault cases occur during parties with heavy drinking. The Department of Public Safety officers who monitor parties on the Row and in the surrounding community should be adequately trained to handle these situations. But if students feel uncomfortable speaking with DPS officers, USC must offer more options. This is not limited to on-call trained representatives to handle reports of sexual assault and a safe space treatment center which has student or faculty representatives who are trained to speak to victims of assault.
The use of private university tuition funding for sexual assault response training for DPS officers would be extremely beneficial for USC. Administrators should enforce more stringent sexual assault education in conjunction with stronger support networks among students. The current “Trojans Care for Trojans” webpage should be expanded to include trained counselors and physicians on campus to respond to victims of sexual assault.
Past efforts among public policy leaders have failed to make justifiable change. At the national level, President Barack Obama worked to allow everyone to become a part of the discussion of sexual assault by announcing his “It’s On Us” plan in September 2014. But in his discussions, and for many other leading figures for sexual assault prevention, the commonly cited statistic that 1 in 5 female undergraduate students experience sexual assault needs to be pushed further — more types of studies need to be conducted with results individualized for different college campuses. And the AAU Campus Climate Survey provides a strong step forward in discussing specialized numbers for specific assault categories at top universities in the nation.
In order to make these proposed changes no longer necessary in the future, we must universally accept the concept of normative growth — the constantly ingrained conventional norms — at a young age. Clinton considers this notion by proposing early awareness and understanding of sexual assault. Starting as early as fifth grade, students should understand the importance of obtaining consent. We must acknowledge sexual assault as unacceptable and align it with societal, moral and legal implications.

Can we not with the ‘1 in 5’ myth? Let’s rephrase that whenever we feel the urge to use it by saying “roughly 20% of 19% of undergraduates who answered a survey representing about 1.3% of all 4-year U.S. universities who claim to have been sexually victimized.”

Alright, Pac-12, this week is our moment in the spotlight. Week 4 is shaping up to be a weekend to showcase all the potential our wonderful west coast teams have to offer in the postseason (Assuming we don’t eat each other alive during conference play). To be fair, Pac-12, you’ve got a tough week to follow. Week 3 was full of upsets (I’m still in shock about the Bama-Ole Miss game and that happened five days ago) and close endings (Sorry not sorry, Texas, I consider last weekend as a very roundabout form of karmic retribution for 2006).
Though we aren’t the only region with interesting games this week. The Big-12 has a game that could end up with a score so high it makes the guys who toss people in the air after every touchdown sore just looking at it. And last but not least, Auburn has another opportunity to try and convince us that it actually deserves a spot in the Coaches Poll or any poll for that matter.
Quick note about the model: It’s still holding at 78% accuracy week over week (better than NFL pundits) so at least that is something to cheer about. Without further ado, here are this week’s predictions!
#3 TCU at Texas Tech (Spread -14.5)
As the defenses of both teams prepare for the game this weekend, I want to make a plea to both teams. Think of the poor college students who decide to toss their friend in the air. I want you to think of how exhausted they’re going to be when the score is 56-42 and TCU just scored another touchdown. How is that poor student going to get homework done the next day when his arms are so sore from the night before? So play some defense, please. Do it for your fellow student.
If you couldn’t tell from that last paragraph, both of these teams have high-powered offenses and porous defenses. Lest you think I am exaggerating, here are some stats. This season Texas Tech has averaged 399 passing yards per game (2nd in the nation) and scored 54.3 points per game (3rd in the nation). Pretty impressive, right? Until you realize that they’re playing against a TCU team that has averaged 367 yards per game and scored 49.7 points per game. Once you also consider the fact that last year TCU won 82-27, the fact that our model predicts Texas Tech as a 14.5 point favorite seems a little odd. But, as last week has shown, anything can happen in college football.
Mississippi State at Auburn (Spread: 17)
I know what you’re thinking — both of these teams are unranked and Mississippi State is a big favorite according to our model. But what makes this game particularly interesting from a prediction standpoint is that Auburn is the Vegas favorite. This is not only surprising because of their performance against LSU last week, but also because Sean White is replacing Jeremy Johnson at quarterback. Though with 6 interceptions in three games, this might be a good call. From our perspective, this game could either be an uneventful Mississippi State steam roll or a chance for Auburn to remain relevant.
#9 UCLA at #16 Arizona (Spread: 0.5)
Arizona and UCLA will be opening up Pac-12 play in what is predicted by our model to quite a close game.
UCLA’s seemingly invincible quarterback is actually human, which is pretty understandable when you remember that last year he was a senior in high school. Despite Rosen’s lackluster performance last week with 106 yards, 1 TD, and 3 INT, UCLA was still able to hold off BYU and stay undefeated.
While everyone has been obsessing over Rosen, we feel that Paul Perkins hasn’t gotten enough appreciation. Though it hurts to say, Perkins is arguably the best running back in the Pac-12 with 26 carries for 219 yards and one touchdown last weekend against BYU. Note the only 26 carries. Even if Rosen still has some growing pains, UCLA’s got plenty of other weapons to lean on.
Arizona’s offense has racked up some impressive numbers. Returning quarterback Anu Solomon has thrown 10 touchdowns and has yet to give up an interception (Knock on wood, Arizona fans.). Nick Wilson adds to the Arizona’s offensive threat with five rushing touchdowns and seven yards per carry.
To add to the drama, UCLA’s linebacker Myles Jack is out for the season after sustaining a “significant knee injury”. Meanwhile, Arizona’s linebacker Scooby Wright might be back from injury this weekend. His presence alone could completely reshape Arizona’s defense and change the course of the game. This Pac-12 opener is going to quite an interesting matchup to watch.
#19 USC at Arizona State (Spread: 8.5)
Last weekend was definitely a bummer for both our football team and for our model. Sure we hung with Stanford through most of the game, but our inability to stop their run offense ultimately led to our demise. Our loss combined with several upsets in our favorite conference (C’mon, you should know I’m talking about the SEC by now) meant it was a tough weekend for everyone. But you know, last year Ohio State made it into the College Football Playoffs with one loss and that turned out pretty well for them so there is hope yet for our Trojans! But that was last week, let’s see what this week has in store.
Good ol’ Arizona State. Last time we played the Sun Devils, we lost in a last-second hail mary and two years ago, Lane Kiffin was fired on the LAX tarmac after losing to ASU. I think it’s a little early to start putting Sarkisian in the hot seat, but nonetheless our history with ASU and our current situation makes this an important game.
Our defensive struggles last weekend do not bode well, especially since we are going up against an ASU team who’s returning the same quarterback that threw five touchdowns against us last year in our last minute, heartbreaking loss. If we want to win the Pac-12 South and maybe – just maybe – get into the playoffs, the Trojans are going to need to bring their A-game this weekend in Tempe.

Don’t let all those books and reading assignments pile up! Danny Helms | Daily Trojan
Almost everyone has a bad habit or two, whether it is biting your fingernails or procrastinating on that essay about Shakespeare. A persistent habit that affects USC students at all levels of education is putting off our readings for class. Though keeping up with reading might be perceived as less challenging than a 10-page lab report in chemistry, the volume of reading assigned to any major can be challenging. Excessive amounts of reading, especially if written in a specific dialect or with unnecessarily advanced vocabulary, is rarely desirable.
As the final weeks of September come to a close, plenty of individuals have looked for anything to save them from stacks of books and handouts piling up on their desks. Regardless of why you have not completed the task, remember, there is a process to getting this done.
1. Keep Calm, and Fight On
Control your anxiety by shifting into a more relaxed mindset. There is no need to panic. Not only having perspective, but also breathing can alleviate a high stress situation.
READ MORE: Click here for tips on how to overcome your worst procrastination habits.
2. Location, location, location!
Find places where you will be more inclined to read. Whether it is the South Lawn behind Roski, or the third floor of Campus Center, there are many study locations that will allow you to be productive while crowds of students pile into Doheny and Leavey.
READ MORE: About productive places to study on campus here.
3. May The Best Class Win, Get That Page Turnin’
Start first with the reading that you find the most enjoyable. By completing at least one reading you will transition more quickly into other classes, and it’s easier to start with a subject you enjoy. Reading for class parallels Newton’s laws of physics: Students at rest will remain at rest, and students in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force. Work has the ability to draw you in, and starting is the hardest part.
4. Listen To The Music
It’s easier to focus when you listen to the right kind of music. Listen to high-energy songs that will motivate you. However, be aware of the tunes that are too catchy. For example, Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj songs can be motivating and inspirational but can also lead to readers who memorize the lyrics of “Partition” rather than finish their WRIT 150 essay.

Remember to take breaks from the stresses of college life and eat and relax with friends. Palak Patel | Daily Trojan
Four weeks in, it’s obvious that school is officially in full swing. The sudden onslaught of midterms, projects and homesickness can often leave us feeling overworked. Adding in first heartbreaks of the year can make for a nasty mix. Bad days, breakups or even boatloads of work can sometimes make you feel like your universe is spiraling out of control. However, through it all, it’s important to remind yourself that this is your college experience, and that you refuse to let anyone or anything ruin it. Here are a few tips that can help you work through those rainy days when you feel more than a little miserable.
1. Grab a bite
This may sound simple enough, but people who are experiencing sadness have a tendency to isolate themselves. Rather than holing up in your room and having everything Tapingo’d to your front porch, round up some of your friends and go out for a meal. Being surrounded by other people will distract you, and maybe even help you get out of your own head for a bit. Also, your friends might help put things into perspective.
2. Go for a run
Getting some fresh air in your lungs and hitting the pavement might not be for everyone, but it certainly does help get out some of the frustration and anxiety that a bad midterm or relationship might have left behind. I recommend heading out early in the morning or a little after dusk, when campus is less crowded and you can better cancel out all that noise buzzing around in your head. 
3. Watch a movie
Sometimes, the best thing to do is nothing at all. Instead, just grab your favorite set of pajamas and fill a mug up with hot chocolate or your favorite tea. After that, it’s just you and Netflix. Have at it!
4. Make a playlist
For many of us, it often seems like the only people that really understand how we’re feeling are on the other side of our earbuds. So take a few minutes out of your day to make a playlist that helps get you going, and blast it on your way down Trousdale. If all else fails, you’ll always have Beyoncé. 
5. Get away
Whether this means going home or going to the beach, detaching yourself from the rigors of college life for even a few hours can help clear your mind. A change of scenery will allow you to reevaluate your priorities. This will help you come back revitalized, and ready to pursue whatever it is that you choose wholeheartedly. 
6. Phone a friend
Take a minute to call your high school partner-in-crime, your sibling or even your mom. Sometimes it’s best to talk to someone who is removed from the situation. They may have insight that could help you decide how to adjust to the demands on your time and your emotions. 
College is a place where clocks seem to tick faster. Sometimes we get so caught up in our busy schedules that we forget that we need some space to breathe in order to feel our best. Take some time to try out one or more of these tips to help balance your emotions.
