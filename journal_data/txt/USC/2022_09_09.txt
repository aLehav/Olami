The interlacing of cultural elements, especially in fashion, has long been problematic in America. The line between appropriation and appreciation can be sharp for designers looking to celebrate cultural overlap — particularly when larger corporations so frequently cannibalize traditional garments with no respect for heritage or authenticity.
As difficult as it can be to toe this line, DAWANG is strutting a fearless tightrope walk.
DAWANG, a contemporary streetwear brand based in New York City, has been devoted to honoring and modernizing Chinese aesthetics since its establishment in 2018. Founder Jingwen Wang — whose friends call her Daisy — has long loved fashion, but hadn’t settled on a specific creative direction until her final project before graduating from The New School’s Parsons School of Design.
“My senior thesis was in 2017, and that was my first mini collection of how I wanted to interpret modern Chinese,” Wang said. “After that I was just heading towards graduation and I was like ‘I’m not sure what I’m doing; I know how to design, I know how to make clothes, but I don’t know how to express my aesthetics, my culture, to other people.”
To hone in on that skill, Wang spent a fifth year at Parsons pursuing a minor in fashion studies, specifically looking to develop her understanding of streetwear subcultures. In studying the hype around brands like Supreme, Wang saw parallels with the rising popularity of Asian culture in the city around her.
“When I first came here in 2013, we had one boba shop within 20 blocks of Manhattan. And when I was graduating Parsons, we had like 10 different boba shops within a 20-block radius. We can feel it, that Asian culture, our food, everything is being more accepted is becoming mainstream… then why not fashion.” 
In studying the qipao, a garment dating back to the 16th century’s Qing dynasty, Wang continued observing the combination of Eastern and Western design but was frustrated with a perceived imbalance between how Chinese and American cultures accepted each other.
“As a Chinese [person], I didn’t even know specifically that our qipao was a mix of West and East — that was the representation of Chinese people in the early 20th century starting to accept Western culture, starting to be like, ‘Oh, we don’t have to hide all our body parts, we can show off a little bit of skin, we can open the slits up a little bit’ … From that point of view, I was like, ‘Wow, look at how Western we are now … if we can accept the Western culture in such a big volume, why can’t Western culture accept us?’”
Wang describes this struggle, of creating garments that authentically accept and celebrate the combination of Chinese and American design elements, as a driving intention behind her work on DAWANG. 
“I want to showcase to people of all cultural backgrounds what modern Chinese can be, how we can appreciate each others’ culture as long as you know what we’re talking about. But that is still a problem, a line that we’re trying to slowly remove, that people are like ‘Why are you wearing our stuff? Are you appreciating it? Or are you just, you know, finding it as a costume?’ … we want to portray modern Chinese in [more of] a lifestyle, more streetwear, more approachable way.”
In just four years, Wang’s brand has built an eminent reputation in New York and Los Angeles’ chinoiserie scenes, complete with a polished online presence that one might expect from such a young designer. On DAWANG’s site, along with gorgeous velvets and brilliant patchworks sit blog posts about the history of the qipao and brocade.
Julia Lin, a senior majoring in journalism, has spent about a year helping Wang with those blog posts but was first introduced to DAWANG while seeking a piece that fit Wang’s vision. Her mother, Judge Tana Lin, who became the first Asian American federal judge in Washington state after being sworn in last December, was looking to “make a statement” at her Senate nomination hearings with a custom suit.
“[My mom] wanted to represent Chinese Americans, because she was the first one in our state in that position. And so I just DM’d Daisy, and was like, ‘Hey, like, here’s the situation,’ and Daisy was super pumped about it,” Lin said.
Lin’s work with Wang revolved around DAWANG’s “storytelling” aspects — blog posts and a social media presence which further describe the brand’s mission. While she found the experience rewarding in many ways, she particularly resonated with Wang’s aspirations behind her designs.
“Working with [Daisy] was a great opportunity for me,” Lin said. “I’m obviously passionate about the Asian American experience and representing our culture. I feel like you don’t see that a ton in the media, you don’t see that necessarily in fashion, in the ways that Daisy does it. Or if you do, it’s not by an Asian designer, or there’s some sort of weird, cultural appropriation undertones. So getting to work directly with Daisy and help her tell the stories of what these clothes mean to her and how she wants them to be accessible to everyone has been really cool.”
While the brand remains modest in size for now, fans in Wang’s circles and beyond have expressed appreciation for DAWANG’s work.
“I really enjoy seeing a refreshed look on Chinese-inspired clothes and garments,” said Annalee Swagerman, a freshman at The New School. “I know some of the work is in older, mainland China styles, but it’s really nice to see an urban version of older styles.
Most valuable for her, Wang describes receiving an immense amount of support from the Asian community in New York surrounding her work — and not just from other designers. Creators of all stripes, from seltzer brand founders to bestselling authors, have offered Wang advice, collaboration and even home-cooked meals based on their shared interest in representation.
“Because I’m doing a startup that’s related to our culture I have the opportunity to meet up with a lot of different founders — within the industry or not — who are working pretty much towards the same goal: to celebrate Asian cultural aesthetics … everybody has been so supportive, even if we are from different countries like Korea, China, Japan, but here we feel like we belong together, like we belong within one community.”
Wang expressed that this sense of belonging has been especially important during the last few years’ rise in Anti-Asian hate. While dismayed by the prevalence of such racism in America, Wang feels that the celebratory intent of her’s and others’ work has helped her find peace — a sentiment shared by fans.
“Coming from someone who is Asian and who has been at the receiving end of hatred for our culture, to see it be urbanized and really appreciated, celebrated and brought back … it’s really exciting,” Swagerman said. “I really enjoy what they’re doing as an Asian person.”
Even beyond its roots in the Chinese American community, DAWANG has much to contribute to the fashion of cultural exchange.
“I think what DAWANG has to offer is a really new perspective on what it means to wear and share your culture,” Lin said. “Especially in mainstream fashion, oftentimes when you’re seeing designs that are made by Asian Americans, it’s more traditional clothing or it’s that qipao style, but taken by big corporations — like a PrettyLittleThing or a boohoo — and done in a way where the history and cultural sensitivity is lacking. But for Daisy, I think she brings a unique, honest and young point of view.”

Queen Elizabeth II’s death marks the end of the longest reign of a monarch in the Royal Family’s history.
During her 70 years on the British throne, she witnessed, according to the New York Times, “epic social and economic change.” She was crowned in 1953 in the first coronation to ever be televised. Her reign lasted through the times in which the United Kingdom entered and subsequently left the European Union almost five decades apart. Just two days ago, she made her final public appearance by appointing Liz Truss as the U.K.’s new prime minister.
The Daily Trojan spoke with international students from some of the Commonwealth countries to gather their reactions to her death and what will follow.
In the face of increasing scrutiny over the Royal Family’s role in modern Britain and the Commonwealth abroad, the Queen was also at the head of the family during years fraught with scandal and growing departure from the Crown. This included Princess Diana’s tragic 1997 passing, the allegations of sexual misconduct against Prince Andrew, the independence of countries such as Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados removing the Queen as their head of state. 
Domingo Powell, a sophomore majoring in international relations, global business, originally from the U.K., said that he had first heard of Elizabeth’s passing after receiving texts from his mother.
A strict set of procedures created in preparation for the Queen’s passing — known as “Operation London Bridge” — has now begun. A grand funeral will be held 10 days from now, closing the London Stock Exchange for the day. Her son, now King Charles III, has ascended the throne and will be officially crowned at a coronation in roughly one year, ceremonies that will spend billions of British pounds. The BBC will be barred from airing comedic shows for the next 12 days, and a total reprint of every pound note with the new monarch’s face on them will begin to take place. Additionally, the lyrics to the national anthem were immediately changed to “God Save the King” rather than “God Save the Queen.” 
Being a British citizen, Diora Juraboeva said her country’s culture heavily involves the Queen, and that affects the way she feels about her passing. 
“In Britain, people are very passionate about the monarchy generally. Everyone really cares about it a lot,” Juraboeva, a freshman majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, said.  “Recently, we had the [Platinum] Queen’s Jubilee, and everyone cared about that a lot. We dressed up postboxes with Jubilee knitted hats and every school always did artwork for the Jubilee.”
The Queen’s death will largely affect countries’ procedures, particularly within Commonwealth nations like Canada, New Zealand, Australia and India, which will observe national periods of mourning alongside Britain. 
“The economy in the U.K. is massively weighed on the Queen’s presence,” Powell said, “and she’s also just a good person. It’s good to be able to look up to a nice figurehead.”
Juraboeva said she was surprised to hear about the Queen’s death. 
“There have been many instances where the Queen has been unwell, like she’s had COVID, , and she was completely fine, so it kind of felt like she was indestructible,” Juraboeva said.  “We knew that she was old, and she would die eventually, but it was just very sudden. Just one day out of nowhere, she suddenly fell ill and suddenly died. I guess we were all expecting it to be more of a gradual process.” 
The Queen’s state, wellbeing and activities are a source of interest for Britons, Juraboeva said, so the news of her passing deeply affected many.
“I think everyone is very involved with the Queen’s life, and I feel like a lot of people would be very upset about it,” Juraboeva said. “Personally, it is quite upsetting since she has been there my whole life, so it feels kind of weird, considering the fact that we do spend a lot of time talking about her.”
In regards to how she feels about the monarchy itself, Juraboeva offered two perspectives. 
“I don’t think it’s very practical, considering the fact that the monarchy doesn’t really do anything. They’re just like figureheads,” Juraboeva said. “But I feel like a lot of people really look up to that, even if they don’t have much of a big role in society. The Queen’s speech every Christmas is [a] pretty big deal, and everyone sits down just to listen to it, so I guess she’s a big part of the culture, but in terms of what they do, it’s very limited.”  
Reagan Wang is a citizen of New Zealand, which is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Wang, a freshman majoring in physics and computer science, found out about the Queen’s death via social media and “didn’t have much of a reaction.” 
“Aotearoa [the Maori name for New Zealand]’s relationship with the queen is a little bit weird,” Wang said. “Aotearoa is still a proud member of the British Commonwealth, but there has been some controversy surrounding both the British crown as well as the British Royal Family itself.”
His thoughts on the monarchy are somewhat similar. 
“As somebody who doesn’t live in Britain but still has the Queen as our official head of state, it doesn’t really impact us because our tax dollars aren’t being used on the monarchy unless they visit or something,” Wang said.  “I definitely do believe that monarchy is kind of outdated though.” 
As for how he imagines this will affect New Zealand, Wang said he does not anticipate much of a disruption. 
“The streets of Auckland aren’t going to be in anarchy,” he said. “As far as I know, I’m not even sure if there is any specific protocol for Aotearoa when a British monarch dies. It’s been so long since a British monarch died that I’m not even sure if New Zealand remembers how to mourn one.”

Jake Freeman, a senior majoring in economics and mathematics, bought 4.96 million shares of BBBY — Bed Bath & Beyond stock — at $5.50 each in mid-July. On Aug. 16, the day when Freeman sold his total 6.2% stake, the share reached a new peak at $20.65 each, as more retail investors participated in the meme rally to buy BBBY stocks — yielding a whopping $110 million profit for the young investor.
Freeman raised $25 million in funds from family and friends as startup capital to invest in the company, according to ABC7. He is the manager of the Freeman Capital Management LLC, a special purpose company created for the Bed Bath & Beyond transaction. 
The volume of trading in the BBBY stock increased and remained unusually high beginning in August to a peak at 395 million shares traded. 
Freeman expressed his surprise as shares of the company roared and fell at a short period in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
“I definitely had no idea it was going to be such a visceral reaction, and the market certainly took me by surprise,” Freeman said. “I certainly was not aware of some of the potential for extreme tail risk to the upside.”
Meme stock — the shares of a company that gained extreme popularity as a result of heated discussions on social media platforms such as Reddit, Twitter and TikTok — continues to attract investors’ attention. Retail investors, especially those new to the venture, communicate with each other to trade stocks that are above their estimated value. 
“Think of it as stocks that have gone viral with internet popularity,” Ratika Narag, a professor of economics, said. “There is a lot of demand for these stocks based on what’s posted on social media and there’s almost like a cult following.”
Meme stock frenzy first started in early 2021 when swarms of retail investors bought stocks of struggling companies, such as GameStop and AMC. The companies tend to be shorted on extreme scales, which means that the current investors are betting the shares will plummet. Investors borrow the stock, resell it immediately and wait for the price to drop. The transaction results in a profitable deal for investors to buy the stock later at a lower price compared to what they originally sold the stock for. 
The origin of the meme stock frenzy interrupted the plan when the collective purchasing power of the online investors drove stock prices up drastically. As the number skyrocketed, the higher level investors who were in position shorting the stock were compelled to pay the high prices for what they borrowed, which in return drove the prices even higher. 
“In recent years, we’ve really been starting to see an increase in the bargaining power of the lower level [investors] … If we bring the power back to the people and we can see that it’s highly lucrative for them,” Victor Falcon, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said. 
Indeed, Freeman profited millions of dollars selling his stake at a perfect timing — two days before the shares fell 20% as a result of a popular investor Ryan Cohen withdrawing his entire 9.8% stake too. 
Cohen is an active investor who led the way in the first meme stock mania: buying GameStop stocks. When he announced five months ago he owned stocks of BBBY, many investors followed his steps to buy the stock. His sale of BBBY stocks not only devastated the price, but it also upset many faithful followers. 
The BBBY shares continue to crash after the company announced on Aug. 31 that it will cut 20% of its workforce and close up to 150 stores. Few days later on Sept. 2, CFO Gustavo Arnal’s death only worsened the investors’ distrust of the company’s financial state.  
As the stock market fluctuates with unknown potential, USC students interested in stock exchange weighed in on the different opinions on what factors contribute to Freeman’s achievement. Ray Zhao, a junior majoring in economics and business administration, said the startup capital Freeman had played significantly into his success on the market.
“Firstly, [investors] need to have enough base money to start up their stock. Twenty million or so … I believe it’s really hard for most people to reach this level,”  Zhao said. 
Freeman said that though he was fortunate enough to raise his startup funds, his success is greater than pure luck or strong support from his family and friends.   
“A lot of people don’t really look at the plan that I put forward,” Freeman said. “The effort and coordination of that plan and to set out to be on a way in which they did remove bankruptcy from their outcomes in cases.” 
Nevertheless, Freeman cashed out with $110 million and made USC faculty proud of his achievements. 
“The economics department and especially some of my colleagues who had him as a student there, they feel really happy and I’m very happy for his success,” Narag said.

The USC football team will head north to play Stanford on the road Saturday, renewing the 117-year-old rivalry between the two elite west coast programs. 
The Trojans are off to a hot start to the Lincoln Riley era, as they blew out the Rice Owls 66-14 last week in the Coliseum. The big win vaulted them up to 10th in this week’s AP poll rankings. 
However, Stanford comfortably handled their season-opening matchup as well. The Cardinal blew out Colgate 41-10, led by a two-touchdown performance by junior running back E.J. Smith, the son of NFL legend Emmitt Smith. Trojan defensive coordinator Alex Grinch knows the challenge that a run-first offense like the Cardinal will pose. 
“I think they have an expectation to play a physical brand of football,” Grinch said, “And it’s on each defense each week to try to match that.”
The Cardinal has always proven to be a tough test for the Trojans. In the past 20 years, Stanford has beaten USC 11 times and lost nine, including in week two last season when the Trojans were ranked 14th and the Cardinal beat them 42-28 at the Coliseum. 
Stanford Head Coach David Shaw has been at the reins for a lot of that winning. Shaw is entering his 12th year as head coach of the Cardinal and holds a 7-5 record against the Trojans. As the “winningest” coach in Stanford history with 94 wins and only 45 losses, it’s safe to say that Shaw knows how to win in any situation. 
The Trojans know it’s important not to overlook the Cardinal despite their recent struggles as a program. 
“I think it’s important for us to stay focused on the week ahead, the game ahead,” sophomore quarterback Jake Jensen said. “We’ve really went into each practice trying to maximize and make that day the best.”
Leading the charge for the Cardinal is junior quarterback Tanner McKee. Following an All-Pac-12 honorable mention season, McKee started the new season with 308 yards and 2 touchdown passes. 
The Trojans are making sure to do their homework on McKee because of the potential he has shown for big games. 
“[McKee] is a really good quarterback and they have a lot of good targets. He can make a lot of throws,” Riley said. “This guy can make any throw, so you can’t let your foot off the gas at any point.”
McKee did throw a pick, however, and Colgate’s lone touchdown was a recovery of a muffed punt. Following a record-setting week for Trojan takeaways, the Cardinal’s less than stellar ball security — Stanford had four total fumbles against Colgate — is a weakness the Trojans likely will seek to exploit. 
In the air attack, senior receiver Michael Wilson seems to be McKee’s favorite target so far. Wilson had a team-high five catches for 82 yards and both Cardinal receiving touchdowns.  Smith also had five catches, yet another way the Cardinal got the ball in the hands of one of their biggest playmakers. 
Senior running back Austin Jones is one key player to watch for the Trojans. Jones spent three years at Stanford before transferring to USC this season. He will be returning to a stadium that he is very familiar with, but as a visitor this time around. Jones says that he isn’t treating this game any differently. 
“It’s just like any other week,” he said. “Those are my guys, but at the end of the day, this is a business. Go out there, get it done, go 1-0 this week.”
Trojan fans hope that similar preparation will lead to similar results after Jones’s two-touchdown performance in the Rice game. 
On the Stanford side, fifth-year senior safety Patrick Fields will face off against his former head coach, Riley. Fields was a three-year starter at Oklahoma and a captain last season. Riley had nothing but glowing remarks about Fields. 
“Pat’s awesome. He’s one of my favorite guys I’ve ever had the pleasure to coach. He did a lot for us on the field but even more for what he did off the field,” Riley said.
Many Trojan fans will have their eyes on freshman running back Raleek Brown after his electrifying Trojan debut. 
Riley said that Brown should be ready to play after suffering an ankle injury last week, along with any other Trojan injured against Rice. 
“All of those guys certainly have a great shot to play in the game,” he said, “I wouldn’t even be close to ruling anybody out.”
As for the air attack, two Trojans who were heavily involved in the passing game last week are still seeking their first touchdowns of the season. Redshirt junior wide receiver Tahj Washington led the team in receiving yards while sophomore wideout Mario Williams showed his impressive playmaking ability with 21.5 yards per catch, but neither recorded a receiving touchdown against Rice. If sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams continues to spread the ball amongst his receivers, look for those two to get into the end zone. 
On the defensive side of the ball, Riley is looking for sophomore edge rusher Korey Foreman to take another step forward as he continues to play more. 
“The longer [Korey] stays on the field, the more flashes you see and the more consistent they become,” he said. “I’d expect him to take another step and play better this week.”
The Trojans and the Cardinal will square off on Saturday with kickoff set for 4:30 p.m. at Stanford Stadium.

The leading contender in the Los Angeles mayoral race, Rep. Karen Bass, is caught up in a scandal involving the former dean of USC’s social work program, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday.
Bass — who in the latest polls holds a double-digit lead over Rick Caruso, the former chair of the USC Board of Trustees — accepted a $95,000 scholarship at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work midway through her first congressional term in 2011. Bass accepted the scholarship in line with congressional procedure and is not under criminal investigation. 
But in a July court filing, prosecutors asserted that former Dean Marilyn Flynn offered Bass admission and tuition hoping for assistance in advancing legislation that would help the School of Social Work receive more funding.
In an interview with the Times, Bass denied that it was apparent that Flynn had a legislative agenda in offering her the scholarship. 
Federal prosecutors are charging Flynn for a separate dealing in which she conspired with former L.A. County supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas to steer county funds to the University in return for admission of Ridley-Thomas’ son into the graduate school with a full scholarship and paid professorship.
Though Bass is not under investigation, prosecutors have called her scholarship and dealings with USC “critical” to the cases against Flynn and Ridley-Thomas, and their broader portrayal of corruption in the University’s social work program, the Times reported.
Bass, for her part, has asserted since 2011 — when she requested an exemption on the rule prohibiting gifts to members of Congress to accept the scholarship — that the graduate degree at USC would expand her understanding of child welfare policy and therefore help her better represent her constituents. 
“Everybody knows that the welfare of children and families has been a passion and policy focus of mine for decades,” Bass said in a recent interview with the Times. “The only reason I studied nights and weekends for a master’s degree was to become a better advocate for children and families — period.”
The congresswoman maintained that she never authored any legislation that benefited USC. Flynn and Ridley-Thomas will go on trial in November.
Bass, who would be the first woman ever elected as L.A.’s mayor, is headed into the final weeks of the mayoral election against Caruso, who served on the board of trustees when Bass received her scholarship. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University said that it quickly reported Flynn’s misconduct to the U.S. Attorney’s Office after learning of the matter in the summer of 2018.
“Marilyn Flynn has not been employed by the university since September 2018,” the University wrote. “Although we have complied with the government’s document requests, USC is not a party to the criminal case and is not privy to what or who the federal government may be investigating beyond what has been publicly reported.”

When I was on the road down to Los Angeles with my mom in tow to help me move into my new, unreasonably overpriced apartment for the upcoming academic year, we had a lot of long conversations and venting sessions about a wide range of things: unruly drivers, my future, whether or not I’ve been going to church — which I haven’t. It might just be me but the triumphant “Fight On” at the end of mass is jarring to me. I grew up going to Sunday school and I was an altar server, believe it or not. I grew up around folks, like my Sunday school teacher, who recounted almost to the point of tears about how they would go into abortion clinics and talk women out of getting abortions. 
In a post-Roe world, I wince at the thought that folks like my Sunday school teacher are in any way jubilant over the new reality that women all across America have to live with. In a lot of ways, though, I think we never put up a good fight against anti-choice advocates. When I say we, I’m mainly talking about those involved in politics and especially those in the supposedly feverishly pro-choice Democratic Party. I mean those in charge of national party strategy, the establishment, those who saw incremental encroachments on a person’s right to choose yet didn’t see anything worth getting worked up about.
Hindsight is 2020, but let me take y’all on a walk through memory lane.
Do you remember when Texas first rolled out that law that put a near-total ban on abortions and called it something inherently misleading like the “Heartbeat Bill?” That was just last year — we’re actually at the one-year mark since it was first passed in Texas. Time flies when you’re busy treating folks capable of birthing as if they don’t know what’s best for them and their health. 
But even before Texas and their fetal heartbeat bill, there were states bold enough to push the envelope on Roe v. Wade — states such as Alabama and Georgia in 2019. In 2018, West Virginia went so far as to amend their constitution, duly stating that, at least in West Virginia, there is no right to abortion. A riveting article in the Texas Tribune details how Texas’ path to their post-Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization reality was nearly two decades in the making; let’s not pretend like the Dobbs decision was out of left field or totally unexpected. 
In the case of abortion, the South has become somewhat of a crystal ball for the rest of the nation. Outlandish or incomprehensible laws from down there may make the news one day but fade into obscurity the next. After all, wasn’t that what happened when Texas passed their fetal heartbeat bill? Weren’t we all dismissive of it? I’m sure the thought in all of our minds was that the bill, and the state of abortion in Texas, would go nowhere. We were wrong. 
I fear that the willingness to brush off the seriousness of these anti-abortion bills in the past was, in many ways, due to the general idea people get whenever they think of a state that has banned abortion: probably red in the last election and somewhere in the South. It would make sense then for Democratic leaders and strategists to not even bother with building up any party or organizational structure in the South if they know it’ll be an uphill battle for them to gain votes in the next election. 
In writing off an entire region, even during campaign seasons, we’ve relegated its people to suffer the consequences of the decisions that a stark minority of their leaders are making. What’s more, we leave the South, the region with the highest percentage of Black Americans — who experience higher maternal mortality rates than any other racial group — to fend for themselves. 
We are utterly ill-equipped for and sluggishly reactionary to any sign of backsliding that comes from the South until it is too late. In doing so, we are putting the lives of Black, Indigenous and people of color in a heightened level of danger. 
I fear we may again be ignoring the signs of what might be lying ahead. Anti-choice advocates in Rhode Island have already petitioned the Supreme Court to hear a case that may outright ban abortion access nationwide. Will we ignore this sign too, and brush it off as too far-fetched to become a reality? I think we’ve thought the same about a whole range of things before — like when a certain real estate mogul was running for President — and look where that got us.
We have to start getting serious about outlandish news, bills or laws that we may be inclined to brush off. We have to start getting serious about the South, or we’ll eventually be scoffing all the way to some kind of dystopian future.

Content warning: The following article contains references to suicide and mental health.
When considering suicide as one of the leading causes of death among college-age adults, second only to car accidents, USC’s utter lack of prevention initiatives isn’t just ignorance. It’s criminal. In the state of California, it’s a felony to deliberately aid, advise or encourage another person to commit suicide, according to Cal. Penal Code 401. Having Yellow Jackets on top of the Shrine Parking Structure is damage control, the bare minimum. This isn’t something you can ignore. We are part of a community that is being challenged to commune and support each other. As National Suicide Prevention Month enters its second week, here is a small care package with six reminders for our Trojan family. 
One for yourself:
Feel the pain. Every Friday night, I look around at the themed fund-ragers I’ve Fryfted to and wonder to myself: Why don’t I feel anything? If the lights were to come on at these functions accidentally, you would uncover the real nature of partygoers. In the age we’re in, we’ve been willing to pay double digits, desperately hoping it will help us find ourselves in places such as parties where the expectation is that you will lose yourself. Stop attempting to staunch the emotions you feel — even the negative ones, especially the negative ones. It doesn’t have to be pretty. Don’t make rainbows from precipitation. Let that rain permeate you so that, when you are finally ready, you have what it takes to grow.
Also, remember you don’t have to face the storm alone. No matter how lonely you feel, somewhere in that dark crowd of partygoers, there might just be someone in the same boat you are — treading water. You are not alone. A life raft is just beyond the horizon.
One for the roommate:
Whether you’ve chosen your roommate or taken your chances on a random assignment, taking notice of your roommate’s methodology and habits is a significant part of cohabitation … but have you ever truly taken the chance to connect with them? Create and contribute to a safe environment of expression. In conversations, listen with no intention of offering unwarranted advice. Sometimes, just being the one person who cares can change everything. Learn the warning signs: feeling trapped, withdrawing, increased substance use, reduced inhibitions and self-neglect. And, if your roommate seems to be secluding themselves, find any excuse to get them out of the house. Even just a change of environment can be magic.
One for the lonely:
Mental health can be very hard to talk about. It’s isolating to feel vulnerable when you’ve meticulously curated your image to seem confident with your Instagram feeding a Pinterest-worthy aesthetic. However, 73% of students with mental health conditions have experienced some sort of mental health crisis during their college years! You’re in the majority! Though anxiety and depression can make you feel uniquely alone, there are 49,500 other students at this school who may be able to understand your struggles and stand with you! In his new PSA with the Seize The Awkward campaign, sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams says, “Pressure doesn’t have to be carried alone.”
One for the friends and lovers:
If there’s one thing more powerful than a hereditary bond, it’s one of a chosen family. No, it’s not just a phenomenal Rina Sawayama song, chosen families are the people you’ve adopted into your life. Through my experiences loving and losing people, I’ve learned two truths. When people you love pull away, fight the instinct to pull them back. Instead, meet them where they are. When you’re feeling desperate, it can be hard to remind yourself of your worth. Another truth is the power of Love Languages. Realize that the way you express love may not necessarily be the way someone else receives it! How are we supposed to express gratitude and appreciation when we don’t know what ways someone wants to receive love? You’ve promised to stay through the triumphs and the trials, so remind them of how much they are loved. If it’s what they need, kiss the homies good night!
One for the grieving:
I’m so sorry for your loss. Take time for yourself, and give yourself the room you need to breathe. It’s alright if you don’t want to or can’t talk about it right now, but when the time comes, there are people who will be there to listen. Your emotions are wholly your own. Grieve as long and hard as you need to. Reach out to your family, chosen or hereditary. You are loved, you are seen and there is a system of support for you whenever you are ready to receive it.
One for the questioning:
Hi. My name is Au, and I have been here before. It took me eleven years to forgive my nine-year-old self. It may take me 11 more to forgive the person I was at 15. But I’ve survived this far, further than I ever would have believed I could when I was at the bus depot after the worst night of my life, further than I had thought months ago during finals and the one before that and the one before that. 
We are each a tapestry of our past experiences, motivations and emotions. So, although I wish there were prescriptions and catch-alls, there is no type of rationality or solution to our feelings. Each day is a choice, each previous one a victory. I used to believe that my situation was so unrelatable and inconsequential that for a very long time, I didn’t tell anyone how awful it felt to simply exist. I was scared of judgment, being told that I was seeking attention or seeming weak.
And yet, despite the paranoias and anxieties, telling a friend what I was going through was the best idea I could ever have made. I had been very self-destructive the few months leading up to that night, pushing loved ones away and isolating myself. I deprived myself of feeling anything good because I was so scared to feel something bad. It was an off-the-cuff decision to text my friend. A simple text turned into a call that turned into a night of tears I thought had dried up a long time ago. People who I pushed away had been waiting to listen, and I felt so much love and support when I told them the truth.  
I beg of you to give yourself another chance. If not for who you are right now, do it for the you who would be proud of how far you’ve come and for the people whose lives you’ve unknowingly changed.

We are only 73 days away from the start of the FIFA Qatar 2022 World Cup and the soccer fan base knows that this edition of the most desired trophy in the world will be a special one. 
Everything seems to indicate that Qatar 2022 will be the last chance for us to witness Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo on identical playing fields competing for the World Cup trophy.
During club performance, the two current astros of the sport seem to be different from their usual selves. Messi’s passes have lost their surgical feel, while Ronaldo’s speed has dramatically decreased, relegating him to a bench spot on a Manchester team missing Champions League action. Yes, certainly the time is near where we will no longer see these two at the World Cup, since it is only a matter of time for a generational transformation. 
After more than 12 years of seeing two of the greatest professional soccer players compete in successive World Cups, we might no longer see them. The two launched their World Cup careers in 2006, representing Argentina and Portugal, respectively. 
Messi rose onto the 2006 World Cup as a kid, competed as a mature teenager when Argentina lost 4-0 against Germany in 2010 and entered as a more experienced player in the 2014 final. Messi’s run brought him as close as possible to the longed trophy, yet fell short in lifting it in front of his people. In 2018, he failed again when Argentina was eliminated by France 4-3 in the Kazan Arena of Russia.
Ronaldo shares a similar story, debuting in 2006 at age 21 under legendary Portuguese head coach Luis Feliple Scholari. Ronaldo shared the field with none other than famed Luis Figo, whom Ronaldo would later surpass in the Portuguese National Team Top Goal Scorer list by 77 goals. In 2010, Ronaldo made it to the Round of 16 only to lose against Spain by a narrow 1-0 scoreline. He later was unable to advance his team past the group stages of Brazil 2014, as Portugal lost 4-0 against Germany, drew 2-2 against the US Men’s National team and beat Ghana 2-1. He then led Portugal to their first ever Euro Championship victory in 2016, only to fall short of the 2018 Russia World Cup due to a 2-1 loss against Uruguay in the Round of 16. 
Today, you have young stars like Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappé who have started to shine with their very own light, but have not reached the level of Messi and Ronaldo. The largest sports competition in the world will not be the same without these stars amid this end of an era.  
Messi and Ronaldo will enter Qatar with great expectations of what may be their last time wearing their national team’s jersey. We would all like to see the final between these two legends in an equally legendary match between Portugal and Argentina. However, if they were to meet, it would likely be in a knockout clash before the final. We can still dream of an amazing end to a career and a sport where these two face each other in the final at the Lusail Stadium. 
Generations have continuously seen the end of soccer eras. Our grandparents saw Pelé and Maradona, our parents witnessed Ronaldo Nazário and Hugo Sánchez. Now, we are forced to say goodbye to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, which will soon leave behind a series of emotions, memories and nostalgia for “goal” chants, all of which will never be replaced. 
New history books will be written about the future of soccer, but it will be hard to match a player who was born with talent, like Messi, and one who worked his skill non-stop with ample dedication to reach the top, like Ronaldo. 
All we can say for now is, “best of luck in Qatar,” and hope that their kids reach a similar skill level for us to continue seeing the names “Messi” and “Ronaldo” on the World Cup almanacs.
