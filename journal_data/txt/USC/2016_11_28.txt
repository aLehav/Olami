A “diverse” campus should allow students to gain valuable real-world experience during the four-year road to obtaining their bachelor’s degree. Adjunct professors from minority groups have time and time again been hired for their potential to introduce a more “diverse environment” on college campuses — and then have been denied tenure for doing just that. Even more unfortunately, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, college students tend to find male professors of color “intimidating” and “unfair” — more so than white professors — when they assert themselves and enforce rules. In other words, being a firm yet fair teacher won’t get a minority male professor the course evaluation grades necessary for him to secure the job. 
According to the Chronicle, minority female assistant professors must see the same objective as an impossible feat. While male professors of color do experience backlash from being assertive in their stances, minority females are often seen as pretentious when trying to promote themselves or simply preserving their dignity. All members of academia — students, administration and faculty, including those at USC — must begin to acknowledge and address this problem if they want to maintain a commitment to a diverse educational experience.
This discrepancy has led some professors, such as a  black assistant professor who chose to remain anonymous when speaking to the Chronicle, to hire white, often female teaching assistants to act as their “cheerleaders” and lighten the heavy mood students claim they endure during class. His efforts prevailed, and he went on to receive generally high course evaluations and is currently awaiting his decision for tenure. 
Another method the same professor used to score higher on his course evaluations was engaging in what he referred to as “customer service.” He would “coincidentally” bump into his students during lunch or study hours and implore them about how their days were going. When asked as to why the professor thought up of this method, he replied, “The students feel like I care now . . . I’m not the big, black scary boogeyman anymore.” 
As opposed to a white assistant professor, who is not only expected to but encouraged to emphasize his strengths and somewhat cover up the entirety of his weaknesses, a female assistant professor of color is expected to first and foremost acknowledge her weaknesses and consequently her presumed “inferiority” and then follow up with what she could offer if given the position. 
In other words, a white assistant professor approaches his superiors with a clean slate, and then goes on to boast about himself from there. On the other hand, a minority female assistant professor must confess to her supposed lack of technical skills compared to the rest of her competition, whether it be a white or minority male, and then attempt to recover herself after an unavoidably terrible start.
In some cases, a minority assistant professor may even win the support of his or her department yet still be denied tenure by the president of the university. According to the Washington Times, Juan Rojo, an assistant professor of Spanish, felt like he had the job in the bag just before the president of Lafayette College rejected him, citing the lack of “distinction” in Rojo’s teaching methods. Essentially, she wanted him to offer even more different and radical concepts in his teachings as a minority assistant professor. This case only furthers the phenomenon that minority assistant professors must go the extra mile in every aspect of their jobs, from building a connection with their students to either highlighting or downplaying their novel lectures, in order to make it in higher education. 
The fight assistant professors of color  have to put up with has tremendous negative mental and physical side effects, such as the case of Jennifer R. Warren, who was attempting to appeal her denial for tenure at Rutgers University but is now currently seeking a job outside of higher education for the sake of her health and that of her family. Additionally, Mr. Rojo staged a hunger strike to bring awareness to and protest the implicit discrimination in the workplace of higher education. Mr. Rojo was also forced to seek work in another field after his efforts failed to bring enough attention.
Still, the fight is not all but lost, as social media has played a major part in encouraging action among college students to back up their professors of color. Twitter campaigns such as #fightforfacultyofcolor and #don’tdodartmouth have blown up over recent years, and now the problem has been and probably will continue to be addressed in school newspapers. Students could very well be the key to truly improving diversity on school campuses, because they ultimately form the socioeconomic backbone of universities and therefore will have the most influence in the long run.
The idea of diversity in higher education should not only be used to entertain, but enlighten the thoughts of college students. Assistant professors of color are often hired for the same reason they’re fired because students and faculty members alike would love to think they’re “culturally sensitive” and “open to new ideas” when in actuality they are unable to commit to being so. Many times assistant professors of color aren’t even given a chance before they open their mouths, because their physical beings don’t match up with that of a stereotypical, stock image of a college professor.
An interesting but very disturbing assertion, if Jerry Lee’s reference is correct. It would mean that white students judge instructors who are of color unfairly harshly. Whether conscious or unconscious, this would be unacceptable, of course.
So what can we do? We can think about our own perspective on our instructors! This matter provides a strong teaching moment for USC students. We need to consider how we view instructors of color, and then to take care to rate, or describe them, fairly and impartially.

In the wake of the election, California’s political leaders released a joint letter, reassuring residents of their ongoing commitment to democratic principles and values. But this commitment need not only come from government — with some existing policies coupled with new ones, USC can also emerge as a collegiate beacon of hope and progress in the face of national fear, disarray and uncertainty.
 Despite President-elect Trump’s fiery climate change-denying talk cooling down as of late, many, especially in light of Trump’s appointment of “climate criminal” Myron Ebell for the Environmental Protection Agency, remain distressed. The goal of keeping emissions down, a priority for the Obama administration, is now in jeopardy. While USC may not be able to influence national policy, it can set the tone for how universities respond. 
USC has unveiled a Sustainability 2020 plan that focuses on research and conservation, but a simple and effective commitment to renewable energy in the form of solar panels would go miles. Not only would this reduce the carbon footprint of the campus and save USC money in the process, but it would also incentivize other universities to follow suit.
The issue is also about keeping the President-elect and his policies accountable.  On the campaign trail, despite gross inaccuracies and generalizations in his statements on the matter, Trump vowed to “fix the inner cities,” promising voters that they had “nothing to lose” and everything to gain with electing him. But fast forward to just a few months before Trump’s inauguration, besides his vague promises of “bringing back jobs,” his plans for these inner cities are as ostensibly absent as his tax returns. Located in the heart of Los Angeles, USC stands ready to assume this mantle. Through its Good Neighbors Program, USC channels money, time and resources into local businesses, nonprofits and schools. But part of the onus falls on us students. Through the Joint Educational Project, the LA Urban Debate League and a myriad of other volunteer organizations and clubs, students can and should invest directly in the future of Los Angeles.
While Trump is not enjoying a smooth road to the White House, the rest of America might not be enjoying smooth roads either for awhile.  That’s because Trump’s ambitious trillion-dollar infrastructure plan has been greeted with little fanfare in Congress. Luckily, USC didn’t get the memo. As the construction of The Village reaches its final phase, 4,800 workers in total have been employed, many of whom commute from the local community. Not only has this project provided work for many, it has also provided job training that will allow these workers to continue to work on and improve infrastructure in L.A. in the upcoming years. And when the final foundations of The Village settle, the next steps for USC include following through with a commitment to invest $20 million in community benefits and ensuring that this new retail space remains affordable for local residents.
But of the greatest significance for many in the country and in the USC community: the looming threat of deportation. After touting the figure of 11 million in the campaign season, Trump looks to immediately deport 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants when he steps into office. He also plans to slash the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, “through which more than 700,000 immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children have obtained temporary relief from deportation.” This rhetoric and these policies drove students from coast to coast, including at USC, to petition their administrations to label their universities as “sanctuary campuses,” or places where school officials would not willingly cooperate with government plans to deport undocumented students, faculty and staff. Based on the concept of sanctuary cities such as Los Angeles and New York, these sanctuary campuses sound ideal on paper, but raise a number of legal questions, such as whether or not Trump could revoke federal funding from USC in retribution. In the meantime, and at the very least, USC should follow through with many recent Undergraduate Student Government proposals, such as ensuring that those who rely of Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals would still receive assistance even if Trump dismantles the program and providing legal aid to all the undocumented associated with the school. Doing so would protect fellow Trojans and send a message not only to other campuses, but also to the Trump administration.
As one of the largest private research universities with recognition both nationally and internationally, USC should continue and expand its work and reach. The time has arrived to strive further and achieve greater, not only for ourselves and our sports teams, but also for our climate, our neighbors and our Trojan Family.
Many of us hope that Mr. Trump will provide legal status to the many illegal immigrants who work, study and want to contribute as legal permanent residents, or even citizens, here someday. Mr. Trump has made some statements that make us hopeful. 
But we also hope that he carries through his promise to deport the drug cartel members and other vicious criminals among the illegal immigrants. If this comes true, it will mean only the best for any Trojans currently not here legally. They will have nothing to fear.

For graduate students, the end of October is when you start feeling the heat — you are venturing into the harder topics of your courses, the next set of exams are due in no time, and assignments are more challenging than ever. Even amidst all of that chaos, being in the U.S. makes it hard to miss the “Halloweeny” transformation happening all around you, beginning weeks before the actual night of Halloween. You notice front yards festooned with spooky spider cobweb decor, random pumpkin carving contests happening at various campus grounds, stores putting up Halloween costumes on sale, and in no time, your Facebook feed is flooded with a myriad of Halloween party invites! 
What is the point of studying abroad if you don’t let a bit of the local culture infuse your life?
With that thought, we took a break from our midterm study time and dashed to a nearby store on the evening of Halloween, bought ourselves some decent costumes and decided to check out a party hosted by VGSA (Viterbi Graduate Student Association) at USC. Except for some carved pumpkin jack-o’-lantern decor and Halloween candy, with people twirling to popular Indian music, it looked more like an Indian student gathering rather than a Halloween party. Not surprising, since Indians make up a sizeable chunk of the graduate student population here at USC. It was a bit disappointing though, since we were hoping to witness an All-American Halloween, complete with apple bobbing, punch served from pumpkins and Halloween-themed cocktails and finger food.
We headed back home hoping to get entry into one of the house parties nearby, only to find that it had been forced to shut down early. But it was quite amusing to watch people from the party stumble onto the street, trying to assemble their drunken set of friends in search of other parties. We had heard that Halloween in the U.S. is an excuse for teenagers and college students to dress up as slutty anythings — from scantily clad nurses to slutty butterflies — and there were people dressed up in all sort of raunchy costumes! 
For us Indians, October through November is also the season of the Hindu festival Diwali, one of the largest celebrations of the year. Diwali, known as the “Festival of lights,” is a celebration of the triumph of good over evil. Back home, it is celebrated with much pomp, with lamps or diyas lit up all around the house, special savories, and a spectacle of burning crackers. At USC each year, the  AIS (Association of Indian Students) organizes a night of dance, drama, and a musical gala. We realized that we had underestimated the sheer population of Indians here when we almost missed entry to the event because of limited capacity. Though we missed out on the traditional scrumptious Indian dinner, the enthralling performances — musical medleys, traditional dance, and drama — it gave us the feeling of being closer to our cultural roots. We ended the celebration by lighting up diyas at our home and savoring some Indian sweets we had carefully stacked away for the occasion.
During the past few years, I have seen my relatives and friends in the U.S. posting pictures of costume parties on Halloween and also celebrating Indian festivals with cultural communities here, and I always wondered what it felt like to be a part of a cultural mosaic. This year, I got to live it myself. It was my first time celebrating a festival of a foreign country as well as my cultural festival in a foreign land. Though neither of them were close to how they are natively celebrated, the joy of being a part of the multiculturalism made it all worth it.

Notre Dame football player Jerry Tillery issued an apology Monday evening after footage from Saturday’s game captured the defensive lineman appearing to push the head of an injured USC player with his foot and step on the foot of another USC player.
The injured USC player, running back Aca’Cedric Ware, was lying limp on the field after suffering a hit from Notre Dame linebacker Nico Fertitta, who would later be penalized for targeting, when game footage showed Tillery’s foot make contact with Ware’s helmet and push his head. 
Soon after, Tillery was called for a penalty of unsportsmanlike conduct for stepping on the foot of senior offensive lineman Zach Banner as he lay on his back after a play. 
“I want to take full responsibility for my actions on Saturday,” Tillery said in a statement released on his Twitter account. “I am truly sorry. I acted in a way that was out of character for me. What I displayed in these two instances were unbecoming and not indicative of the kind of player or person I am.”
Both Banner and Ware seemed to accept Tillery’s apology, speaking out from their Twitter accounts on Monday night. 
“Mistakes happen bro, I’m good, [Ware is] good,” Banner wrote. “You earned my respect from your apology. Take care.”
Ware expressed similar sentiments, responding simply with, “respect bro.”
In an interview with ESPN following the game, which ended in a 45-27 Notre Dame loss, Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said that he would be discussing the two incidents with Tillery. 
Tillery has been subject to controversy at Notre Dame before. Last season, he was suspended from Notre Dame’s bowl game for violating team rules, and in October, he made headlines when his Twitter account appeared to like multiple tweets that called for Kelly to be replaced by LSU’s former coach Les Miles.

Though the University’s $6 billion fundraising campaign is just $300 million shy of its seven-year goal, a report released Monday showed that USC’s endowment fell by 2 percent in 2016.
According to L.A. Biz, a study conducted by the American City Business Journal reported a decline at USC from $4.71 billion in 2015 to $4.61 billion in 2016. The study analyzed 25 private, non-profit schools with large investment portfolios, specifically universities with endowments of $1 billion or more at the beginning of the 2016 fiscal year. The 2016 fiscal year ended for most universities on June 30, though some institutions have yet to publish their most recent data. 
USC, however, was not alone. Every university analyzed — except for Boston University — saw a decline in their endowment. According to the report, the cumulative loss of these particular endowments were 4 percent of their value, or $5.3 billion. Southern Methodist University reported the greatest percentage loss at 8 percent, dropping from $1.55 billion to $1.42 billion.
The findings indicate this may be the worst year for private colleges since 2009, when the decline was a much greater 16 percent loss following the Great Recession. Fredd Puddester, the chief financial officer at Williams College, told L.A. Biz the drops could be attributed to a “particularly ugly year” in equity markets. 
The University has undergone a $6 billion fundraising campaign since 2011. The campaign aims to, among other things, raise funds specifically to increase the endowment. $5.7 billion has been raised from donations by 312,403 alumni, parents and faculty to date, according to the campaign’s official website. Of the money currently raised, $1.4 billion will be devoted to endowing faculty positions and research endowments, and $359 million will be devoted toward endowed student scholarships and fellowships.
