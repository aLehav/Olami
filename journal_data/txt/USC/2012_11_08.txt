The University Park Campus will become a sea of cardinal and gold Saturday for USC’s Homecoming Game against Arizona State, with music blasting and the smell of barbecue. There will be a tangible feeling of excitement and school pride in the air, as nearly 10,000 Trojan fans will gather around to cheer on the football team.
“As a Trojan, game day is a time to celebrate the university we all love,” said Chris McCall, a junior majoring in business administration. “On game days, we have the chance to appreciate all that USC has given us and show our collective pride while enjoying an experience unique in the realm of college football. Football is the main act, but it would not be as impactful without the Trojan Family there to enjoy it.”
The large increase in the number of people in the area has the greatest impact on the Dept. of Public Safety, which is tasked with patrolling campus and ensuring all fans remain safe and obey the rules. Football games bring unique challenges for DPS by presenting issues that are different from what officers deal with on a typical day.
“We deal with tailgating issues such as controlling amplified sound and enforcing the university’s no drinking games policy,” said DPS Capt. David Carlisle. “Other typical game day issues include illegal food vendors selling on campus, the sales of unauthorized USC merchandise, and occasional ticket scalping. On a very warm day, we routinely receive medical calls which are typically a result of people becoming dehydrated.”
Students said they have seen these problems firsthand.
“For the Cal game, it was over 85 degrees and many people were still consuming copious amounts of alcohol,” McCall said. “I believe that actual crime is a minor problem as compared to the impacts on the health of students and fans.”
According to Carlisle, all DPS personnel are required to work during a home football game. Officers are assigned either a full shift on campus or a full shift at the Coliseum. As DPS is responsible for the safety of all of the students attending the game, their primary responsibility at the Coliseum is Gate 28, the student section entrance.
“There are seats for 12,000 students. DPS, along with private security, screen the students as they enter the Coliseum to make sure they abide by the rules of attending a game at that venue,” Carlisle said. “Typical violations at Gate 28 include public intoxication, using someone else’s ID, attempting to take alcohol into the Coliseum or cutting in line. Those students are cited into SJACS and ejected from the stadium.”
The home opener about Hawaii on Sept. 1 had the most student ejections from the game, which Carlisle attributed to the fact that it was the first home game of the season and many new students had yet to learn the importance of the rules of conduct for football games. There were 30 students ejected from that game, while the California and Colorado games each had 11 student ejections.
“The biggest concern is that there is basically unlimited access to alcohol on game days, and there are many young children present too,” said Michelle Nadjar, a sophomore majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. “Even though adults are everywhere, sometimes they partake in the drinking more than the students and can’t serve as the best supervision for their kids.”
Although DPS is primarily responsible for activities occurring on-campus and students at the Coliseum, LAPD is responsible for the area surrounding campus and the general public attending the game.
“There is an Emergency Operations Center off campus which is activated on game days,” Carlisle said. “Representatives from multiple agencies including DPS, LAPD, L.A. Sheriff’s Department, L.A. Fire Department, USC Metro Line, LADOT and representatives from other agencies all work together in joint command to oversee all of the game day public safety issues from one central location.”
Carlisle said DPS has seen no change in the amount of crime that occurs on game days in recent years. The football team has played in front of a filled Coliseum almost every game this season, an increase from the last two years when the NCAA bowl ban was still in effect.
“I basically feel just as safe on game days as I do on normal days because there always seem to be tons of random people on campus,” said Mariah Robinson, a sophomore majoring in theatre.  “It just gets a little more alarming on game days because there’s a mass majority of people who are probably intoxicated.”
Other students cited conflicts between fans as a primary concern.
“I feel slightly more unsafe when there is a home football game,” said Jackie Molina, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering. “Because of the competitive nature of USC football, fans from the opposing team get very riled up.”
Although game days are not known as high crime events, Carlisle said that fans could help DPS by taking steps to reduce the most common rule violations. This includes refraining from purchasing food or merchandise from illegal vendors, consuming alcohol wisely and hiding valuables that are locked in parked cars.
“In spite of thousands of fans and students tailgating on campus and at the Coliseum and the amount of celebrating that takes place, the fans are remarkably well behaved,” said Carlisle. “For the size of the crowd, we have very few serious problems, which speaks well of Trojan fans.”
10,000 will congregate on the west endzone alone. you are orders of magnitude off.

Following last week’s on-campus shooting on Halloween night, many students questioned how the university’s Trojans Alert emergency messaging system worked. Though the crime occurred at approximately 11:45 p.m., students did not receive an email or text message about the event until 12:02 a.m.
The Trojans Alert system is run through the Roam Secure Alert Network, which allows the Dept. of Public Safety to simultaneously send alerts and instructions to an infinite number of communication devices, according to DPS Chief Carey Drayton. RSAN can also automate alerts from government institutions and news stations. Other colleges across the nation, such as the University of Maryland use this system — in fact, Maryland implemented its form of Trojans Alert a few weeks before USC.
The department has been using Trojans Alert since the 2006-07 school year, according to Drayton. The emergency system is open to anyone who signs up for it, and, currently, there are 37,239 students registered. Since DPS started using Trojans Alert, the reasons for using it have adjusted to the different safety issues that arise on campus.
“The system is now used to provide information to the community when any unusual occurrence is happening in the community, in addition to the system’s original purpose,” Drayton said.
More than 40,000 people received text messages and emails from the department the night of the Halloween shooting on campus, according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle. Each cell phone carrier responds differently to the Trojans Alert text messages, which can result in a delay from the message being sent to it being received.
The criteria to send out a Trojans Alert is based on the university’s pre-determined hazards emergency plan. Among the factors considered to send warnings to students, faculty and staff are the amount of information known and what department is leading the efforts to manage the emergency.
DPS carries the ability to monitor which groups of people receive the alerts, such as residential students, commuter students and parents.
Carlisle is one of the DPS officers responsible for sending out the messages, and based on his discretion and knowledge of the event, decides which group will receive the alerts. Previously, the system has been used to send out information about earthquakes and other safety hazards for students, faculty and staff.
“We rely on good judgment with big situations like the incident last week,” Carlisle said. “For big incidents, it is an easy decision, but with other decisions, we have to decide if we should send out an alert and to whom we need to send it to. Sometimes we have to take a moment to see if the information is accurate and then act quickly.”
Demi Coolen, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, acknowledged the efficiency of the Trojans Alert system, but was concerned about its timeliness.
“There’s a positive and negative side to Trojans Alerts,” Coolen said. “Everyone was freaking out, so the delay was really inconvenient but not super detrimental. But then again, you don’t want to get it wrong.”
Lizhi Fan, a freshman majoring in computer science, also sees the difficulty in relaying detailed information in a timely manner.
“It’s impossible to be instantaneous,” Fan said. “But it was a pretty severe event, and in those cases you want to be as secure as possible, and as quick as possible.”
DPS is working on solutions to increase the speed of Trojans Alert, according to Carlisle.
“Sometimes, we have to sacrifice accuracy for speed,” Carlisle said. “But we really don’t want to have to do that too often. So it’s really about finding a balance for informing students as quickly as possible, as accurately as possible.”
Sacrificing accuracy for speed? Perhaps in certain situations, such as something like a downed power line or gas main break. But an active shooter on campus? There shouldn’t have been more than 2 minutes delay to the time the message was sent. Granted this situation was an altercation, but a shooter could have potentially been on his way inside another building on campus had this happened during the day and been a random occurrence as has happened on multiple college campuses in recent years.

Tony Award-winning playwright David Henry Hwang spoke Thursday about his experience of being an Asian-American in the arts, the influence of the arts on the human experience and strategies for writing a good play.
Pioneer · Playwright and screenwriter David Henry Hwang discusses his experience as an Asian-American and artist Thursday. – Zhaoyu Zhou | Daily Trojan
Visions and Voices hosted Hwang, known for his play and film M. Butterfly in addition to several other works, at Town and Gown.
Throughout his speech, he noted art as being a tool for self-discovery. He pointed out, however, that what is important is the journey toward self-discovery.
“If art is a tool for self discovery, then self discovery is an art, and in all these arts there is a result, but really the experience and the richness comes from going through the process,” Hwang said. “So it is the process that is the cake and everything else the icing.”
Following this trajectory, he explored his childhood experience as an Asian American. Hwang said there was a monoculture in America and the goal of immigrants was to fit this monoculture as closely as possible.
“Growing up in the 1960s in California, I didn’t think much about being Chinese,” Hwang said. “I knew I was, but I didn’t think that it held any importance because during that period we were living through monoculturism. The goal of immigrants was to aspire to be like real Americans. In those days, the model was European.”
Hwang continued on to describe how art helped him realize his place in society and history.
“The one time I turned to writing was to try to conceptualize myself — to try to understand who I was in a larger social and historical continuum,” Hwang said.
He concluded that portion of his talk by suggesting that Asian parents need to allow their children to become more involved in arts regardless of what success they achieve.
“Often when I talk to Asian parents, I always say that it’s great that you acknowledge artists like myself who have had some success,” he said, “but what is really important is that you honor young people when they go into the arts because they are the people who really need your support.”
During Hwang’s presentation, he offered the audience some strategies he employs for writing plays. He encouraged the audience to allow the subconscious to become more prominent when they write plays. Hwang said this allows the story to become more three-dimensional.
“Lots of times when we begin to do anything, we approach it with our conscious mind, we try to control it and that’s understandable,” Hwang said. “But the conscious mind only has so much knowledge. It is only able to reach so deep. Whereas with the subconscious, you’re willing to go to the unknown, you’re willing to take risks. Oftentimes, you end with wrong turns, but other times, that’s really when your work comes to life.”
For Eun Jee Song, a graduate student studying communication management, the event was an opportunity for her to see a man she admires.
“It was really impressive, especially the part about multiculturalism,” Song said. “There was a new movement when he grew up, and he was a pioneer.”

Students weighed in on changes they believe should be made to USC’s current General Education program Thursday at a forum sponsored by Undergraduate Student Government and the Academic Cultural Assembly. USC professors John Monterosso and Marcus C. Levitt, who teach in the GE program, answered students’ questions at the event in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Changes to the GE program have recently been considered among university faculty and administrators.
The GE Faculty Committee has compiled a list of recommendations, which include increasing the number of required GE courses to a total of eight: one course in the arts, two in the humanities, two in the social sciences, one in life sciences, one in physical sciences and one in quantitative reasoning. Currently, the university requires students to take six courses.
Another proposal is to allow appropriate major and minor courses to fulfill GE requirements. Faculty from several arts and professional schools will be able to offer GE classes as well, possibly opening up more class options in the GE system. A new name, “USC Literacies Program,” has also been recommended. Other recommendations include restructuring the Thematic Option program in accordance with the new GE program.
In addition to faculty recommendations, students in the forum raised many major issues they believed need to change.
Many said GE classes lead to difficulties for students with stringent unit requirements for their majors. As a result, students said the courses become obstacles rather than opportunities. Some students, such as Al Valmadrid, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, proposed a few possible solutions.
“What if you get the students that are initially interested, and reduce the number of GE courses required,” Valmadrid said. “If you increase the number of GE courses, it goes in the wrong direction of its intent, because people wouldn’t be able to take the classes that they want. Professors can also get the students they want who have more enthusiasm.”
Some believe the proposed changes could run into a potential roadblock because USC is not a liberal arts university.
“People don’t want changes that add more to their work; they come here for pre-professional [opportunities],” said Monisha Bajaj, a sophomore majoring in communications and minoring in music industry. “That’s who we are — we’re not a liberal arts school. But if they want people to have a liberal arts education, which is something I value and I think it’s necessary, you have to change people’s attitudes towards the classes they’re taking, and one way to do that would be to change the structure of the course.”
USG Commuter Senator Adam Prohoroff said he believes the current GE system helps students transition into the real world.
“To move ahead and be able to connect with people, you need to have a well-rounded education,” Prohoroff said. “In the short term, you may look at it one way, but in the long-term, the GE program at USC is something that is really going to help students in their professional careers.”
USG’s Director of Academic Affairs, Andres Guarnizo, concluded the forum by promising to act on the many proposals for change.
“We want [students] to know that there are professors and there was a review and we also want to highlight that the student government is thinking about it,” Guarnizo said. “We’re listening and we want to make sure that it’s an opportunity to contribute through us and that we will be advocating for the changes that students proposed today.”
USG Residential Senator Jasmine McAllister told students to contact the organization if they have any concerns or opinions about changes to the GE program.
Manny, John, and Aaron,
Thank you for your feedback!
Your comments will be included with the concerns and questions brought up during the GE Forum and relayed to the GE Committee.
Please feel free to contact us with any additional comments.
Best,
Undergraduate Student Government Senate
Please don’t ruin TO by bringing it down to the GE’s current level. The program is fantastic as is. If anything, GE’s would benefit from being more inter-disciplinary like TO.
GE’s are essential. I graduated from a ‘professional’ school. It was considered an accountant factory to Wall Street. But every business major had to take 64 Liberal Arts credits before taking one business class. When I was 18 or 19 I thought that was a terrible idea. Thirty plus years later it turned out to be not such a bad idea. A lot of the information I learned in the professional classes were obsolete before the ink dried on my diploma. The Liberal Arts courses taught me how to think. 
My daughter is in a very intensive professional program in the Cinema School. When we learned what USC had to offer, I was just as excited about the Core as she was about the film school. College is about broadening your minds.  You’ll be able to do whatever you choose better with a broad mind.
OK, OK, this Dad’s gonna get off the soap box now.
GE’s produce a well- rounded education? Not in the slightest. The current GE system produces a spiky education, with a lot of depth in very specific areas on different ends of the educational spectrum.

USC hosted the groundbreaking ceremony Thursday of the Wallis Annenberg Hall, marking the launch of a $150 million fundraising initiative.
Breaking ground · USC administrators and supporters of the new Annenberg building mark the start of construction Thursday of the 88,000-square-foot, five-story Wallis Annenberg Hall. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
The hall will be located next to the Pertusati Bookstore at the corner of Childs and Watt ways, and is scheduled to open in the fall semester in 2014.
A $50 million lead gift for the 88,000-square-foot, five-story building was donated by Wallis Annenberg, chairman of the board of the Annenberg Foundation and the longest serving trustee on USC’s Board of Trustees. The hall will provide innovative technology and facilities to prepare students for an industry that is becoming more reliant on digital media.
“All the spaces have been carefully designed to be connectors and not containers, to be inviting and transparent, to encourage those passing by the building to enter the building to experiment to collaborate, to innovate and to learn,” said Dean Ernest Wilson III of the Annenberg  School for Communication and Journalism. “It’s designed to tear down the old media silos of print and broadcasting and web so it presents a converged newsroom that the students will understand. So when they get real jobs in the real world, they will have that unique experience.”
The money raised will go toward supporting new projects for the new Annenberg building, including new technology enhancements, scholarships and fellowships. The new building will include a 20,000-square-foot newsroom that will publish student work across multiple platforms, a multistory digital media tower showcasing live student programming and a 360-degree assignment desk that will help facilitate the work of all Annenberg organizations while bringing the work of print, online, web and radio together.
USC hopes the new building will continue Wallis Annenberg’s love for journalism and further her feeling of the field’s importance in society.
“To share the compelling story of our daily lives, modern journalists must be equipped with all of the technology skills and the ethical principles to do their jobs and to do this well,” President C. L. Max Nikias said during the ceremony. “Wallis Annenberg has long recognized that it is not merely enough to train journalism students how to talk about a particular subject. She understands that they must also be given a deep knowledge of the very latest digital technologies, and that’s why it’s so important for us to have this new building to house our journalism programs and to provide the state of the art laboratories and equipment that will allow them to experiment, learn and succeed.”
In a move announced in May, Annenberg laid off nine employees as part of a restructuring effort. The action led to some speculation that the cutbacks were made to save money for the new building. But, the cutbacks were not related to the building project, Geneva Overholser, director of the School of Journalism, told the Daily Trojan. The cuts, instead, were made as part of an attempt for the Annenberg School to “achieve savings in the wake of fiscal headwinds,” she said.
The funds for the building project came directly from donations, Overholser said.
Students who attended the ground breaking supported the new building, excited it would provide a beneficial experience for everyone, no matter the major.
“It will be a great, completely high-tech space for people to come together and create ideas, discuss ideas and facilitate them and watch them come to reality,” said Eric Lavis, a graduate student studying communication management.
Jenna Kovalsky, a senior majoring in public relations and international relations, said she felt proud to see the beginning of a building that would focus on bringing students together.
“I think this is an exciting time for Annenberg,” Kovalsky said. “We’ve always prided ourselves on being innovative so having this new space will be another opportunity for us to bring students together and collaborate and improve the field of journalism and communication.”
Faculty members are also looking forward to the improvements the building will have for the classrooms and the Annenberg organizations. They hope features like the converged newsroom will have a positive impact on changing the way student organizations will report and distribute news.
“The infrastructure of the school is catching up with the reality on the ground,” said Marc Cooper, associate professor of Annenberg and director of Annenberg Digital News (Neon Tommy). “That new infrastructure is going to be very useful for us and it’s also going to move all of the Annenberg media ahead because it’s going to force us to work more closely with each other, which we have already started to do but this will finalize it.”

With postseason play right around the corner, the USC men’s water polo team hopes to continue on its course toward another run at a NCAA championship. With an undefeated season in progress, the team will take on two opponents this weekend: nonleague foe Concordia and No. 4 Pepperdine.
“We still have to remain focused,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said of the team being so close to the finish line. “We have games this weekend that we could easily lose if we don’t stay focused on the task at hand.”
In Concordia, USC faces after losing three of its last four matches and is entering McDonald’s Swim Stadium with little momentum. The school’s most recent game was a 21-7 loss to No. 2 UCLA, which spells trouble given the Trojans’ talent and recent history of success against the Bruins.
“They have a few individual players with real talent,” Vavic said. “They’re going to test us. You can’t overlook anybody because that’s when bad things happen.”
Concordia’s roster is full of international players, which can often present problems. Many European players grow up loving water polo, and though the sport does not have a strong following in the United States, this familiarity with the game puts USC’s players at an initial disadvantage.
“European players often come with more experience,” senior driver Michael Rosenthal said. “They watch professional water polo a lot, so they usually come over with some tricks. It’s definitely an eye-opener when you see a roster full of players from Europe.”
Following the game against Concordia, USC will once again hit the road, this time for a short trip to visit Malibu and take on Pepperdine. Pepperdine, the fourth-ranked team in the country, is also reeling, having lost two of their last three games to tough teams UCLA and No. 4 California. Having already beaten the Waves before, USC knows what to expect in trying to stop their attack.
“We’re always prepared for them,” junior utility Mace Rapsey said. “They have a big team with some good center forwards that their play is based around.”
Pepperdine is driven by senior attackers Matthew DeTrane and Stephen Loomis, who led the team in scoring but were held to only three goals combined in Pepperdine’s NorCal tournament loss to the Trojans. Vavic expects more out of them this weekend.
“They like to run plays for their big guys in the post, especially [DeTrane],” Vavic said. “It’s going to be up to our back line to communicate and not let him get easy touches.”
With the team on the verge of the postseason, the players know that their focus is crucial now more than ever. One slip up during this point in the season could ruin everything the players and coaches set out to do. But the team is confident that their routine will eliminate the chances of a debacle.
“We’re always prepared,” Rapsey said. “[Pepperdine] has a bigger team with some good center forwards that their play is based around. We know their team pretty well, and we’re going to prepare in every way possible to take them down.”

The Women of Troy have had a difficult run during Pac-12 play so far this season, but a trip to the Mountain West to face Utah and Colorado could help them get back on track this weekend.
Last weekend, the USC women’s volleyball team (22-4, 10-4) with upstart Arizona State which had too much momentum for the Women of Troy to handle. The Sun Devils recorded just their second victory against USC in their last 35 meetings, and did it in fine fashion with a three game sweep.
Although the Women of Troy bounced back nicely with a four-set win Sunday against Arizona, despite the best efforts of outside hitter Madi Kingdon who recorded 18 kills and 19 digs, they will have to stay consistent and gain some continuity in their next few conferences matches.
“I think it was very important that we came out of Sunday’s match with a win,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “Friday night was very disappointing, and when you’re on the road, you have to win by force. Coming back after losing is pretty good when you take into consideration all the teams that lost this weekend.”
With six conference matches left to play, Haley’s group sits in the third spot in the conference rankings, tied with Washington and UCLA. Matches against Stanford and Cal loom ahead, and a rematch against crosstown rival UCLA is slated to be the last regular season match for USC.
If the Women of Troy hope to make any noise at the top of the Pac-12, this weekend will go a long way to building momentum for their tough upcoming schedule.
“We just have to continue our progress this weekend,” sophomore setter Hayley Crone said. “These teams are going to give us a fight and we just have to be prepared,”
USC will begin its trip to the Rocky Mountains in Salt Lake City against Utah (12-15, 3-11). As one of the newcomers to the Pac-12, Utah has had a tough time adjusting to the constant competition that the conference brings on a nightly basis as evidenced by its lopsided record in the Pac-12.
The Utes are looking to break a seven-game losing streak against USC and seem to have an upset on the mind after taking both No. 8 Washington and Washington State to five sets last weekend.
One thing that Utah has going for it is their strong blocking and superb play at the net. Led by middle blocker Bailey Bateman, who ranks third in block per game in the Pac-12, the Utes will look to stifle a USC attack that has sputtered against dominant defensive teams.
USC heads to Boulder, Colo. on Saturday to face off against Colorado (14-12, 4-10) and finish its road trip in style. Like fellow newbie Utah, the Buffaloes have had a hard time adjusting to the Pac-12 and they have only won one match over their last seven games.
The Women of Troy are undefeated against Colorado in the all-time series (6-0) and will look to stifle a diverse, all-around attack from the home team to extend the streak. With five players averaging at least two kills a game, Colorado knows how to spread the ball around, which should keep USC busy at the net.
The talent disparity between the two teams should be the difference-maker in this match as USC has far superior athletes led by freshman Samantha Bricio and senior Katie Fuller. Junior libero Natalie Hagglund has also been a force for USC even in its defeats, such as her 23-dig performance against ASU last weekend. The Women of Troy are starting to feel the fatigue of the season, but are changing their habits to make sure they are in their best form.
“The key was to have shorter practices and get some sleep this week to prepare for Utah and Colorado,” Haley said. “We have a fast turnaround with a lot of travel, so it will be tough. The girls are tired and we have our work cut out for us, but we have to be focused and get our bodies and our minds where they need to be.”
The Women of Troy need a dominant pair of games of wins in the Rockies, as conference play is quickly coming to a close. A three-game winning streak heading into a home against NorCal rivals Stanford and California sounds like the perfect formula for success.

Following an eventful offseason, it’s finally time to see the results of college basketball’s version of Extreme Makeover. Eight months after USC concluded a historically bad season on a 10-game losing streak, the USC men’s basketball team — featuring nine new players, including five transfers — is looking for a fresh start.
Hot seat · USC men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill received heavy criticism after the 2011-12 Trojans lost a school-record 26 games. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
That first opportunity to turn over a new leaf comes Friday night, as the Trojans host the Coppin State Eagles at the Galen Center, with tip-off set for 8 p.m. The Eagles finished 14-16 with a 9-7 conference record last season, but are being picked to finish 10th in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference after losing all five starters because of graduation.
The Eagles’ top returning scorer is Taariq Cephas, who averaged 5.7 points per game and was named to the MEAC All-Rookie Team as a freshman. Like USC, Coppin State has nine new players on its roster; Towson transfer Troy Franklin is expected to take over the role as leading scorer.
The Trojans did not practice like the team usually does on Thursday, instead using the day to watch game tape of the Eagles.
USC opened the 2011-12 season with a home win over Cal State Northridge at Galen, but coach Kevin O’Neill is mum on his expectations for Friday’s opener.
“We want to try to get a win,” O’Neill said. “You go into every game trying to get a win. In college basketball, it doesn’t matter who you’re playing. If they’re wearing short pants and a jersey, they have a chance to beat you, so we have to come every game and play the right way.”
For O’Neill and the team, the “right way” focuses on defense, physicality, and above all, total commitment to playing together as a unit.
“If you become an all-in team, you win games,” O’Neill said. “You win on hustle, sharing the ball and all of the things that come with those. That’s what we have to be.”
All four of the currently eligible transfers figure to play a role in the rotation and the fifth, 7-foot-2 Rice transfer Omar Oraby, has been granted a hardship waiver to play immediately.
For three of the transfers, Friday’s game will be their first NCAA contest in nearly two years.
“I’m a little bit nervous, but as soon as I go out there it will all go away,” said junior forward Ari Stewart, who sat out last season while redshirting after transferring from Wake Forest. “I’m just trying to make sure I get everything right.”
Another transfer, junior shooting guard J.T. Terrell, said that O’Neill’s practice style is invaluable preparation for the actual season.
“I think we might play even faster than in-game speed in our practices,” said Terrell, who averaged 24.4 points per game last year playing for Peninsula College in Washington after leaving Wake Forest following his freshman year. “We’re a lot more physical [in practice] than what the refs are going to call in the game, so we’re prepared with that.”
Despite the loss of last year’s leading scorer in guard Maurice Jones, Terrell and senior point guard Jio Fontan, who missed all of last season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, will form what could be a dynamic starting backcourt duo.
“They’re veteran players and they both play with force,” said O’Neill. “They’re both playmakers, so I wouldn’t trade those two for any other backcourt in the country.”
The Trojans set a school record for losses last season, finishing 6-26 and winning only one Pac-12 game, against Utah. In addition to the loss of Jones (now at Iowa State), forward Garrett Jackson and guard Alexis Moore also transferred to Saint Mary’s and the University of Pennsylvania, respectively. Despite the losses, the Trojans returned 52.2 percent of their scoring from last year and 56.8 percent of their rebounding.

Few athletic programs earn dual acclaim for their football and men’s basketball teams. To wit, Florida, Ohio State, Texas and Notre Dame are the only universities that really qualify. Without question, USC’s path to improving its basketball program and joining their ranks is littered with obstacles — some endemic, most brought on by poor management and the aftershocks of self-imposed sanctions levied in January 2010.
One thing is certain, though: If you want to build a sustainable basketball culture at USC, don’t follow USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s blueprint. Of USC men’s basketball’s 13 scholarship players this season, 10 began their NCAA careers elsewhere, thus prompting the 2012-13 squad’s nickname, “The Second-Chance Kids.”
O’Neill openly embraces the moniker, recently referring to his roster — himself included — as a collection of “rejects.”
But here’s the question: Is this new cast-of-rejects angle attractive to the rest of the USC student body?
Many probably assume so, given our inherent gravitation to the underdog narrative. After all, we’ve all chanted “Rudy!” at one point in our lives.
But color me skeptical that Trojans will readily embrace this team.
I want to like this USC men’s basketball team; honestly, I do. The swanky Galen Center deserves a better brand of basketball.
But even if this team wins with regularity and flirts with an NCAA tournament bid this season — a strong possibility — USC men’s basketball needs to change its DNA in order to win over its fan base.
Beyond their miserable record, the Trojans were unbearable to watch in 2011-12 because their roster didn’t teem with likable, magnetic personalities and the offense was unimaginative at its best and putrid at its worst.
USC football isn’t marketable just because of its winning tradition; it’s marketable because of affable headliners like senior quarterback Matt Barkley, sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee and junior cornerback Nickell “Real Deal” Robey. Not only do these players burst with talent, but they also beam Hollywood smiles and face scrutiny with poise.
USC basketball didn’t feature those types of personalities last season, especially after guard Jio Fontan, the face of the program, tore his anterior cruciate ligament.
The recently-departed Maurice Jones, who assumed Fontan’s captaincy, operated with a permanent scowl and often barked at his teammates in disgust. Those antics aren’t endearing when you’re Kobe Bryant, but even less so when you finish the season shooting 33.6 percent from the field like Jones did.
Junior center Dewayne Dedmon — the frontcourt’s centerpiece — bursts with NBA lottery potential, but frustrated last season with low basketball IQ, especially when he proudly pumped his chest after each hard foul he committed. Dedmon’s tenacity and length evoke images of a raw Kevin Garnett, but his lack of basketball experience leads to mistakes fans wouldn’t even make in their pick-up games at the Lyon Center.
As for USC’s lowly offense that averaged 52.6 points per game in 2011-12, to be fair, I won’t judge the Trojans after then-junior forward Aaron Fuller and Dedmon suffered season-ending injuries within two games of each other. With two walk-ons in a seven-man rotation by the end of the season, the “offense” necessarily consisted of Jones running around for 35 seconds before heaving a desperation attempt.
But even before the devastating injuries, USC didn’t run the floor and play an up-tempo game. It often appeared as if USC sought to milk the shot clock just to limit possessions, keep the game close and give itself a chance to pull out a late victory. As Trojan football fans know, tentative playcalling irritates your fan base. Moreover, it doesn’t attract future recruits who want highlight reel dunks.
O’Neill’s new glut of transfers figures to at last provide offense, but it’s still unclear whether they’ll improve the team’s likability among students and fans.
The problem with O’Neill’s revolving door of transfers and hired guns is that many of the players brought in to stabilize the program have already not worked out at their previous schools for one reason or another. He’s taking the leap of faith that they will all buy in and not become frustrated if the minutes and shot opportunities they expected to receive never come.
Former Wake Forest guard J.T. Terrell, who averaged 24.4 points per game at Peninsula Junior College in Port Angeles, Wash., will likely lead the Trojans in scoring this season. The deadly shooter comes with baggage, however, as he left the Demon Deacons after pleading guilty to a DWI charge in 2011.
Last February, junior forward Ari Stewart, another Wake Forest transfer who was sitting out the season per NCAA transfer rules, was arrested for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in Maricopa County, Ariz. on a weekend when USC was playing at both Arizona and Arizona State.
Needless to say, these are not violent crimes and young adults make mistakes, but these two explosive players will make their USC debuts Friday night at the Galen Center toting checkered pasts.
Still, for the first time in his tenure with USC, O’Neill expects to use an eight- or nine-player rotation where the drop-off between starters and reserves won’t be too severe. After a cringe-inducing season featuring a historically inept offense playing at a slower-than-molasses pace, we’re promised something better this season.
But only time will tell if USC fans will rally around and embrace “The Second-Chance Kids.”

USC fired a student manager that intentionally deflated five game balls below regulation levels in USC’s 62-51 loss to Oregon last Saturday, the university announced Wednesday.
Advantage · A student manager was fired for illegally deflating footballs that were used in last week’s game. The team and coaches deny involvement. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
According to USC coach Lane Kiffin, the Pac-12 informed the school of the incident on Sunday, and the school’s compliance department conducted an investigation immediately.
The Pac-12 announced that it had “accepted USC’s self discipline on Wednesday and has additionally issued a $25,000 fine to the USC football program.”
Before the game, officials found that three of USC’s game balls were in violation of NCAA regulations. At halftime, two more were discovered.
Each team uses its own footballs on offense, and deflated balls can be easier to throw and catch.
“We acknowledge the Pac-12’s reprimand and fine,” USC Athletic Director Pat Haden said in a statement. “We regret this incident occurred. It was unacceptable and we apologize for it. I can assure you this will not happen again.”
Kiffin said that according to the compliance department’s investigation, no coaches, players, staffers or administrators knew of the manager’s actions.
“They don’t know why he did [it],” Kiffin said. “[Senior quarterback] Matt [Barkley] was questioned in this as well, obviously. He had no knowledge of this at all.”
Kiffin said he was told that the student manager was seen on the Oregon sideline deflating the footballs before the game.
“For all the conspiracy theories that will think we’re behind this, I don’t think if we were trying to deflate balls, we’d be directing a student manager on the Oregon sideline, right in of them, to be deflating balls,” Kiffin said. “I was just disappointed because it was a distraction that nobody here knew about.”

It was more than a tip of the cap by Arizona State coach Todd Graham, when asked about No. 19 USC during his weekly Monday news conference.
“They’re very, very, very talented,” he said, toeing a line between compliment and hyperbole.
All-purpose · Sophomore wideout Marqise Lee might see time at defensive back against Arizona State on Saturday. He is second in the country in receiving with 1,286 yards and has also caught 12 touchdowns. – Sean Roth | Daily Trojan
Past the midway point of the season, though, the very, very, very talented Trojans are 6-3 overall and 4-3 in Pac-12 play, standing in second place in the conference’s south division after consecutive losses at the hands of Arizona and Oregon. They won’t catch much of a break anytime soon either, as Graham brings yet another high-scoring spread offense to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday.
Arizona State, which averages 37 points per game, good for 22nd nationally, squares off against host USC at noon.
And so the Trojans, one week after giving up a school-record 62 points versus Oregon, will be forced to hope for some sort of a quick fix on defense to contend with the Sun Devils’ unit after “everything” was wrong with their defensive performance one week ago, according to USC coach Lane Kiffin.
It wasn’t just the scheme against the Ducks. It wasn’t just the execution. It wasn’t just Oregon, either. It was, well, everything.
“If you give up those kind of numbers, it has to be everything,” Kiffin said. “You can’t give up that amount of points and that amount of yards without it being everything overall. And so it was a combination of every aspect of defense you could think of for it to get to the level it was at.”
That level has been, of course, discouraging. During the last two games, the Trojans have surrendered a total of 101 points and 1,318 yards, including a school-record 730 yards against the Ducks.
Chip Kelly’s bunch  also scored a touchdown on nine of its 13 drives against USC.
“I’ve never heard of that many yards,” said Monte Kiffin, the team’s assistant head coach for defense, on Saturday night following the 62-51 loss. “It’s mind-boggling.”
One possible solution to a seemingly growing defensive problem appears to be trotting wide receiver Marqise Lee out at defensive back.
Lee, who has caught 88 passes for 1,286 yards and 12 touchdowns this season and leads the country in all-purpose yards, is considered a preeminent Heisman Trophy contender as the result of his performances on offense and special teams. His candidacy might grow even further Saturday against the Sun Devils, by lining up at cornerback or safety.
Naturally, it might help USC’s struggling unit, as well.
“We’ve looked at some defensive situations for the first time this week with him out there,” Lane Kiffin said during his post-practice press conference Thursday. “That may present itself Saturday.”
Previously, following the Oct. 4 game against Utah in Salt Lake City, Lee lobbied the Trojans’ third-year coach for the chance to play on the defensive side, at corner. Nonetheless, he has remained solely on offense, in spite of the petitioning.
The 6-foot-1 sophomore had played safety at Junipero Serra High School in Gardena, Calif., and was recruited primarily by USC as a defensive back.
The Trojans, unmistakably, will need some sort of help in the secondary against Arizona State’s passing attack. The unit is engineered by sophomore and first-year starter at quarterback, Taylor Kelly, who has grown in the starting role. The Idaho native has thrown for 2,161 yards and 20 touchdowns on 65.6 percent passing. Not to mention, he’s only thrown six interceptions and has 383 rushing yards, which is the third best on the team.
The previous two quarterbacks to face off against USC’s secondary — Arizona’s Matt Scott and Oregon’s Marcus Mariota —  threw for a combined 673 yards and seven touchdowns to just one interception.
Arizona State (5-4, 3-3), though, is coming off three straight losses, falling to Oregon, UCLA and Oregon State during the last three weeks.
Saturday’s game is scheduled to be televised by the Pac-12 Networks. The noon kickoff is also the earliest kickoff time for a USC home game since a 1998 contest against Purdue, according to the conference.
What is the PAC 12 channel and why do we not get it????
we have direct TV and they say they are  working on it.
Why aren’t USC TROJANS broadcasted on regular TV  eg:  Fox, sportsnet,  espn  nbc  abc.
Why are the pac 12 gurus trying to block fans and allumns from watching football, basketball, baseball etc???
Please have the courtesy to respond it the Daily Trojan to these questions.
We feel very slighted.
Why a Noon start for Homecoming?? Very little time to renew friendships and check out the campus for Alums.
Can’t believe that TV once again is restricted to PAC-12 network. It is killing the support for SC football.
Hey perhaps someone can “deflate” the network!
A really sad year for all Trojan alums and fans.
The game will be over by 4…

With the election finally over, political discussion will return over the coming weeks to its usual, more manageable fervor. Though a welcome respite to most, that certainly isn’t to say that it’s time to tune out of current events completely; for anyone who consumes television, doing so would be more or less impossible. Politics and entertainment are inextricably intertwined.
Though there are certainly those who want their entertainment to do nothing more than provide a diversion from current events and complicated issues — and rest assured, plenty of reality shows, and some high-quality programming as well, cater to this particular audience —  others have no problem with their entertainment tackling meatier societal and governmental issues.
Through its characters, every story is going to make some comment on people and the way they interact, and, in so doing so, incorporates the writers’ thoughts on the world around them. This is inevitable. What varies is how obvious each story is about its encoded political messages.
On one end of the spectrum, there are the preachy pieces of media: Though existing predominantly as entertainment, television shows also have a very clear lesson that they wish to impress upon their audience. Glee often has multiple examples of this per episode with well-intentioned, but grating and heavy-handed, messages about bullying and sexuality — social issues that have, no doubt, become political in recent years.
Then there’s Aaron Sorkin’s The Newsroom, which many critics lambasted as nothing more than a soapbox for its creator’s criticisms of the media. Though he got away with depicting his ideal presidency on The West Wing, it seems that he overstepped his bounds with the revisionist news show — or perhaps his trademarks were simply starting to wear a bit thin.
On this season of Boardwalk Empire, too, every storyline contains some form of social commentary — the show discusses race relations, military veterans and prohibition in the 1920s. And its female lead, Margaret Thompson, (Kelly MacDonald) is in the middle of a personal crusade to provide women with prenatal education through a Catholic hospital.
The last is a subplot that doesn’t ring quite true, as it’s obviously inspired more by women’s issues in America today — political issues — as opposed to a realistic depiction of what was going on in the ’20s. Historical fiction is meant to use the past to reflect on the way things are now and to look at how far we have or haven’t progressed. Yet this example feels more like the writers are shoehorning modern politics into their show in a way that doesn’t necessarily fit as naturally as it could. It’s certainly not bad, by any means — like everything else on the show, it’s handled in an effective manner both in terms of writing and acting. The only issue is that it’s hard to watch without thinking of it as an overtly political exercise, an unrealistic exploration of social issues in the context of Boardwalk’s timeline.
The issue with politics in entertainment, then, is not avoiding or hiding from it, but making sure it occurs as a logical extension of the show’s world. For the best example currently on television, look no further than Showtime’s Homeland.
After its first season swept this year’s Emmys, expectations were high for a sophomore effort that could maintain the series’ quality and momentum. So far, Homeland is more than succeeding. With a team of writers who’ve all had experience running their own television shows (most tellingly, the post-9/11, real-time catharsis that was 24), this character piece about a prisoner of war who might or might not have been turned into a terrorist and the woman trying to discover the truth about him is a bit of a miracle, at least in terms of its narrative: In this second season, the show plays no games in the breakneck pace with which it propels events forward.
The last few episodes have seen the series redefine itself at least twice by way of triggering major revelations and story culminations long before viewers accustomed to serialized television have been conditioned to expect, and in doing so, it has become one of the most exciting programs to follow from week to week.
But Homeland is rooted in deeply political origins, with the War on Terror serving as the backdrop and high-ranking government figures as primary characters. The destructive nature of drone strikes, Israel’s response to the nuclear threat posed by Iran and extralegal CIA actions are all major components of the show’s dramatic underpinnings. Preaching to its audience would be all too easy. Yet, everything feels entirely natural, with multiple points of view represented and characters believably navigating the world around them, trying to do what they believe is right. In response, fans find it riveting — no matter what their own political leanings happen to be. Stark, honest, challenging but never obvious or condescending, Homeland is politically charged entertainment done right, an example from which other shows with politicizied agendas could learn.

If you hail from a moderately urban area of the country or were born in the last 30 years, chances are you have never been to a drive-in movie theater. They seem like an archaic part of modern history that only exists in James Dean movies or period pieces set in the ’50s. But, if you have ever gotten the urge to partake in this one-of-a-kind experience, look no further — a rooftop drive-in movie theater is now open in Downtown Los Angeles.
Electric Dusk Drive-In, located at the corner of Fourth Street and South Broadway, celebrated its very first screening on Sunday, Oct. 28. Founded by owners Eric Heusinger and Darryl Semira, both actors and native New Yorkers, Electric Dusk will screen one to two films every month on the second story of the parking structure it calls home.
The debut screening was 1985’s campy murder-mystery Clue, based on the board game of the same name. The Tim Curry romp was screened in honor of Halloween, and Electric Dusk invited customers to dress up as their favorite character to pay tribute to both the film and the impending spooky holiday. Many visitors came outfitted as beloved characters, everyone from Ms. Scarlett to Wadsworth, the loveable but suspicious butler portrayed by Tim Curry.
The atmosphere was, well, electric. With a snack shack set up in the back and a 24-foot screen towering over the lot, Electric Dusk feels like an authentic drive-in. This illusion is slightly tainted by the tall buildings surrounding the second story rooftop, but the city lights and vague street noise contributes to the atmosphere nonetheless.
The rooftop joint felt like a mod nostalgia trip for hipsters and cinephiles alike. And the metropolitan-hip vibe is immediately apparent from the moment your vehicle reaches the roof of the parking structure. It creates a city escape in which the city is still apparent, but far enough removed to feel like an otherworldly experience. And fear not — if you have no car, there is Astroturf set up in front of the screen, so all you have to do is bring a chair and a Snuggie and you can enjoy the drive-in experience, too.
But even with its retro authenticity, Electric Dusk is not a perfect escape. While the atmosphere on the roof is quite enveloping, a simple trip to the prison-like restrooms, located on the main floor, will remind you of the fact that you are in Downtown Los Angeles.
But in an odd way, Electric Dusk’s grimy location adds to the charm of the overall experience. Visitors are sitting on a rooftop for two hours watching a blow-up movie screen; there are carhops going from car to car taking food orders. This is not meant to be a chic, fancy event — it is old-fashioned, yet charming. Plus, there are worse ways to spend a Sunday than on a rooftop in your car with nothing but friends, junk food and a cheesy movie. And it is all part of the modest, retro vibe that Electric Dusk creates.
The employees at Electric Dusk also recognize the value of good hospitality. The customer service is quite timely, as drivers are immediately directed to their parking spot on the lot, which is distributed on a first come first serve basis, and promptly given a snack menu. Electric Dusk’s menu includes the typical movie treats — burgers, hot dogs, soft pretzels, candy, chocolate and cookies — as well as some not-so-typical treats, such as a Cup of Noodles, coconut water and an oatmeal cookie pie.
The only misfire on the menu seems to be a burger, which appears artificial and frozen. The soft pretzels, however, were par for the course. And the gourmet cookies offered were phenomenal: They were giant, chewy, extra-chocolatey chocolate chip cookies with a moist brownie stuffed inside to create one of the most luscious desserts known to this city. Surely, it was made somewhere off grounds, but it was fresh and undeniably delicious — enough so to justify its $3 price tag.
Although there were some hiccups in the timeliness of the food delivery, such issues can only be expected on the opening night. And, by the end of the night, the snack bar had expedited their system so that car hops were delivering food promptly and freshly.
By and large, Electric Dusk is sure to be a hipster-haven in the future, so go check it out while it is still Downtown Los Angeles’ little secret.
 
Tickets for the Nov. 10 screening of West Side Story are available in advance online and at the door. Proceeds will benefit the Red Cross’ Hurricane Sandy relief efforts.

Men and women lounge on blankets and rugs strewn across the floor, sporting afros and tunics. Lovers embrace and sniff flowers. Someone lights incense. The walls are covered with scribbled phrases such as “Draft Beer Not Boys” and “Make Love Not War.” Music fills the room, and suddenly the men and women begin to sing, “I got life, mother. I got laughs, sister. I got freedom, brother. I got good times, man.”
Political protest · Jade Johnson (center) stars as Sheila in USC’s production of Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical. The production heavily relies on a large ensemble, named the “tribe,” to carry the show. – Charlotte Spangler | Daily Trojan
This might sound like a documentary about the hippies of the 1960s, but these descriptions actually reflect a recent rehearsal for the upcoming production of Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical. The show follows the story of a tribe of protesting hippies in New York City and dives deep into topics of love, family, drugs and the Vietnam War.
The show is a result of 10 weeks of work by the students in the Experimental Theater Workshop in USC’s School of Dramatic Arts. Considering the proximity of the show’s opening to Election Day, there could not be a more perfect point in time for this show to be performed.
“It is apropos to the issues of the year — especially because our show runs during election week,” Dan Fishbach said, SDA faculty member and director of the show. “It is an important show for people to work on in this time in America. It’s an age of high charged politics just like the time period it takes place in.”
Many themes of Hair  are applicable to modern issues, including war, the power of young people and perhaps most importantly this week, the importance of voting and making your voice heard.
“[On Election Day] I realized how applicable it [was],” Lindsay Strongin said, a junior majoring in communication and a member of the tribe in Hair. “The show also closes on Veteran’s Day [Nov. 11] which is another interesting coincidence.”
While the cast planned their production of Hair, they frequently discussed the message of the musical and how they wanted to communicate it to the audience. During this process, the discussion often turned to the play’s themes and relevance to the cast members’ own lives.
“It is neat to watch the cast identify with the show itself and the messages of anti-war, peace and anti-establishment,” Fishbach said.
Many castmates expressed their passion for the ideas of the play, especially on the power of the young person’s voice. Throughout the show, the characters protest the government, discuss contesting the draft and work toward making a difference.
Fishbach noticed this commitment from the students, as well.
“I was surprised by the willingness of students to embrace and start to live the themes of the show. It has been cool to watch students transform into disciples of the show’s themes,” Fishbach said.
Many aspects were easy for the cast to relate to, but others required more work for the actors.
“The Vietnam draft is hard for students to relate to,” Fishbach said. “They had to ask themselves, ‘How do we make this accessible to us?’”
The challenge of appropriately communicating these issues was just one of the problems the cast had to face. The limited rehearsal time (only six hours per week) kept the group from being as prepared as they would have hoped when going in to opening night.
“It is a really big show, and we really had to buckle down these last few weeks,” Kathleen Porter said, a junior majoring in theater and another member of the tribe.
Though discussing the themes of the show was a priority, most of the class’ time was spent on the music. The production boasts 51 musical numbers, most of which involve complicated harmonies, full dance sequences and fast-paced tempos.
“It took us a really long time just to learn all the songs,” Myriam Willard said, a senior majoring in theater and another member of the Hair ensemble.
Other challenges included having to devote time to designing the costumes and set, finding volunteers to be on the tech crew and promoting the show.
“All the actors in this show also worked as choreographers, tech people, designers, etc.,” Porter said.
But despite the challenges, the cast hopes the audience is able to focus on the themes of the play.
“We want people to leave with ‘open eyes,’” Henry Boyd said, a freshman majoring in theater and another member of the tribe, quoting a line from a song in the musical.
Strongin also had hopes for the audience and the impact the show could have on them.
“The least we can hope for is that the audience has awareness and realization,” she said. “Even if they don’t leave with their eyes open, they at least have them open during the show.“
Fishbach explained that the cast constantly brought up issues during class that they thought were applicable.
“This is a show that speaks very directly to audiences,” Fishbach said. “Audiences will have a hard time not identifying with some of the issues and questions posed.”
Despite the challenges, the themes and the format of the show as an ensemble-based production helped bring the cast, or tribe as they are referred to in the script, together.
As Willard summarized on the strength of the cast: “There’s a really spiritual part of this show. We’re all connected. We’re all one.”
 
Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical runs from Nov. 9 to Nov. 11 at the Massman Theatre. Visit uscexperimentals.com for ticket information.

What made the difference between a second term for President Barack Obama and a first term for Mitt Romney? Ninety-three percent of black voters, 71 percent of Hispanic voters, 73 percent of Asian voters, 55 percent of women voters, 63 percent of voters earning a family income under $30,000 and 60 percent of voters ages 18 to 29 who voted for Obama, according to The New York Times.

This is the new reality of the United States — one with which the Grand Old Party is becoming increasingly removed from. The fact that the valid rhetoric about a declining economy and failed promises — that so many voters, both Republican and Democrat, could identify with — was trumped by issues such as immigration, women’s rights, education and tax policy speaks volumes. Post-election, it has become even more evident that the GOP must adapt its social and fiscal policies to survive and have any future success in this new America.
Across the board, election results demonstrated that the GOP platform of tradition and conservatism is no longer working. Rep. Todd Akin, who said in August that victims of “legitimate rape” rarely get pregnant (in defense of his view that abortion should be illegal), lost his Missouri Senate seat to a female Democrat, Claire McCaskill. Though Romney took more conservative stances on gay marriage and medical marijuana, both were legalized in multiple states: gay marriage in Maine, Maryland and Washington, and marijuana in Colorado and Massachusetts.
Romney seemingly chose to stick with the GOP of the past, relying on a demographic that is increasingly becoming the minority in the United States. The opinions and beliefs of that demographic are becoming the minority as well, and running between those values and an attempt at moderacy might have been what sealed Romney’s fate.
If the Republican Party wants to survive in a nation where non-Hispanic whites will become the minority by 2050, and possibly even earlier if the rate of immigration increases, it must change its policies on immigration. And as gay marriage becomes legal in more and more states, as more and more women are in positions of power in the government and as the middle class grows, the GOP must also recalibrate its stances on marriage equality, abortion and what level of income-earning Americans should bear the heaviest tax burden. This is not to say that the GOP has to abandon all of its principles, but it needs to at least take a more moderate, tolerant stance on issues that are most important to America’s largest — and growing — demographics.
Not to mention, a GOP more rooted in the present than the past America would help break some of the partisan gridlock that is hindering important progress on many of these issues. Los Angeles Times journalist David Horsley wrote in a recent article, titled “Obama’s victory is a harsh lesson for Republicans,” that Speaker of the House John Boehner is uniquely positioned to lead this change. “Just because [Boehner’s] party has gerrymandered its way into a fairly safe majority in the House does not mean he can continue to carry on as if this election did not happen,” Horsley writes. “Boehner should make it clear the time has come for compromise and deal-making. He needs to tell the tea party purists in his caucus that they had their shot and it did not work.”
Boehner is one of many Republicans in power who could lead the GOP out of its conservative, incompatible past and into a stronger future.
In the coming weeks and years, the spotlight will obviously be on Obama, but maybe the true test moving forward is for Republicans. They must choose between staying wedded to an increasingly out-of-touch past or reinventing themselves along with the America they claim to love so dearly.

In an interview with Parade magazine in August, President Barack Obama said, “A lot of the things I’ve done are things that Mr. Romney, when he was governor of Massachusetts, seemed to promote.” During the presidential race, many pundits and politicians noticed that aspects of Mitt Romney’s campaign platform were markedly different than some of his former stances as governor of Massachusetts.
They were right. Romney, generally a moderate Republican when he served as governor, shifted much of his platform to the right, trying to identify with the current petty, absolutist GOP to secure more votes rather than revive the socially progressive, fiscally conservative group of the past.
What the Republican Party needs in order to be more successful is not this attempted medium, but instead a return to its roots — when it was focused on sound, sustainable policy rather than backward social ideas.
Romney’s shift during the presidential election doesn’t make much sense in terms of earning votes. It’s not as if extreme conservatives would have voted for Obama if Romney had remained relatively moderate, so by assuming a more conservative stance he only alienated moderate Republicans and undecided voters. Unfortunately for Romney, however, he had no choice but to do so: The Republican Party has drastically changed in the last several decades, becoming stubbornly attached to overly simple solutions to national and global problems. To earn Republicans’ support, Romney had to do the same.
Some of the policies that seem to define the Republican Party today, such as lowering taxes and assuming an anti-abortion stance, were not even on the Republican agenda until the 1980s and 1990s. In 1956, the Republican platform looked drastically different — it increased social security, substantially funded public transit and proposed federally built medical facilities, among other progressive initiatives. They also supported bigger government — as long as it was fiscally sound and not too radical. Today, proposals to implement perfectly reasonable and functional policy changes, such as educational reform and birth control, are met with cries of “no new taxes.”
These kinds of absolutes have begun to ruin the party. Instead of developing well thought out policies to solve the country’s problems, Republicans resort to simple mantras and catchy phrases to appear as if they’re effecting change. Take, for example, the Tea Party’s “declaring war” on government overregulation, which doesn’t articulate anything specific and leads bills that might have a positive impact to be shot down by the House of Representatives solely based on partisanship.
In the weeks before Election Day, for example, Obama was working on a measure that would have provided $1 billion over five years to veterans and could have potentially created up to 20,000 jobs. Obama and another Democrat, Wash. Senator Patty Murray, put forward a plan to pay for the measure, using fees on Medicare providers and existing tax measures. Senate Republicans, however, shot down the measure on the grounds that it was “unpaid for.” While it’s certainly possible that Republicans only opposed the measure on fiscal grounds, it’s unlikely that they did not see the benefit of denying Obama’s legislation right before an election. Petty party divides, rather than a desire to improve the country, are driving political action.
Moderate Republicans, because of the evolution of their party, no longer have much of a voice. Supporting the Republican Party comes with the baggage of opposing gay marriage and women’s rights and knowing that members of the House are engaging in party politics that will stagnate this country’s development. Romney mentioned in his concession speech that we must try to bridge partisan divides; before that can happen, members of his own party need to remember their original roots.

Republicans?  Pfft!  Who cares?  Rather, how can the Democratic Party reinvent itself?
There are many ways the Democrats can interest more voters, thereby creating a situation where there are no more close elections!  
The Democratic Party should open wide the gates to all forms of immigration, as that would enable both legal-and-illegal immigrants, substantially increasing the number of Democratic voters.  As an added plus, the increased quantity of labor for a fixed number of jobs (as the aggregate number of jobs has not improved in 4 years) would mean wages go down for all labor as a larger pool of applicants compete for the same number of jobs (many unskilled).  Thus a larger demographic of immigrants and an increasing number of lower-wage earners means more Democratic votes.
An additional measure too ensure a larger base of lower-wage earners: taxes should be raised as that will reduce pay.  If taxes can be raised significantly that will lock-in costs, ensuring a higher-probability of lower wages, by lessening savings for investment.  With limited capital to invest, there must be limited capitalism — formation of businesses depend on savings.  Higher wages and a resultant higher standard of living (that must be taxed), disproportionately, incentivizes voters to trend Republican.  So keeping wage-growth minimized is key.
Wages can be controlled and minimized by increasing the supply of labor and increasing taxes (reducing savings, capital and a chance for capital formation).  Wage-growth can be contained further if “nothing is done regarding trade” and we continue to move factories to China and increase our trade deficit.  GATT/WTO was a great thing (thank you, Bill Clinton) as it gave us low-cost goods.  It also means that the US limits its manufacturing employment (and exportable goods) which allows for more job creation in the service sector (as entrepreneurs look for opportunities beyond manufacturing) that tends to pay lower wages.  Again, creating an environment conducive to lower wages means a lower standard of living; lower incomes will drive increased Democratic voting.
Basic Economic-Republicanism is about smaller governance: maximizing individual income (with lower taxes) and minimizing market intervention from government intrusion (with fewer rules and regulations).  But if government maximizes intervention, seeking to expand (significantly) public sector employment, then we could create more interests aligned with government and its functions and purpose.  
Seeking opportunities to expand public-sector employment with above-average pay and generous benefits will significantly incentivize a constituency to vote for the party advocating an expansion of government size, thus more Democrats!  The added benefit is that if enough public sector jobs are created (with substantial wages and benefits), the private sector that is taxed to pay for the public sector jobs will experience higher costs, creating a feeling of being poorer among private-sector taxpayers, thus creating a slight trend to more Democratic voting among the private-sector demographic (as incomes decrease, in aggregate, more voters will trend Democratic).
And this are just some economic policies to consider.  
Otherwise, there are non-economic policies that would assist in increasing a larger Democratic electorate.  As just one example, both married men and married women vote more Republican than Democratic.  If something can be done to encourage increased singleness, thus creating more unmarried men and women, then the Democratic party would not only be favored by both groups at election but trends would be heavily Democratic. 
Come on, people!  We are almost there!  We only need to accelerate trends; Democrats in 2014! in 2016! Forward!
(yes there are some horrendous typos, among other things. but regard the spirit of the ideas.)
[…] And on the future of the GOP: How should the Republican party reinvent itself? […]

At orientation, students in most majors are given sample four-year schedules detailing when to take what classes. Some freshmen have their entire college career mapped out by the second week of school.   
But what about the students who have not yet selected a major? Unfortunately for them, USC lacks an advisement system comprehensive enough to address their unique needs.  
As spring semester registration approaches, undeclared students face the usual challenge: determining from two-sentence course descriptions which classes could potentially illuminate lifelong passions.
These students, however, are given little assistance in accomplishing this task.  They are told to fill general education requirements and take courses that sound “interesting.” But there is always a significant chance that the classes selected by these students will not inspire them, nor help them receive credit towards the majors they eventually choose.
USC could do much more to help undeclared students. For example, they could offer “course samplers” in which students would explore multiple fields of study during one semester.
They could also reform the advisement system itself. Currently, the university assigns advisors to undecided students based solely on their last names. Instead, they could split these students based on broader interests, such as humanities or the natural sciences—with one category reserved for those who are utterly lost. 
Alternatively, they could train or hire specialized advisors who focus solely on helping students discover their passions.
Given the frequency at which college students change majors, it is arguable that course selection is somewhat arbitrary for any first year student. But undecided students face additional disadvantages.
Because they are not plugged in to any particular department, they often miss out on special programs and other opportunities.  They are also unable to declare minors. Specialized advisors could help in these areas as well, by identifying programs of interest or unofficially advising students on courses required for minors they like.
In the meantime, however, students struggling to find that one class to illuminate their dreams can easily become disheartened. If the undeclared advisement program was strengthened to better support students, this issue could be eliminated.
