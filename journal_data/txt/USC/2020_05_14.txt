Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs Andrea Hodge will step down from her administrative position, effective June 30. Hodge will return to focus on her professorship at Mork Family Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science in the Viterbi School of Engineering.
“I would like to express my gratitude to Vice Provost Hodge for her exemplary work in this role,” Executive Vice Provost Elizabeth Graddy said in a communitywide email Thursday. 
Hodge has served in her vice provost role since July 2016. Her tenure was marked by her work with the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund Board, where she updated the scholarship’s 40-year-old charter and expanded the program to include Topping Scholar and Fellow recipients. Hodge also worked to increase the reach of the Kortschak Center for Learning and Creativity, a center for academic and career coaching services at USC. 
“It has been a great joy to spend time with students from all schools and majors and learn about their motivation and passion for their chosen field,” Hodge said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I have also very much enjoyed and appreciated the hard work and dedication of the [Undergraduate Programs] staff, who work behind the scenes, to improve and expand the programming and services that make the USC academic experience valuable and memorable.” 
Hodge also worked with the Undergraduate Student Government to implement the transfer forgiveness program. The program was originally offered only to first-year freshmen to retake up to three classes in which they received grades of D+ or lower in their first two semesters at USC. 
In addition to her post on the provost’s leadership team, Hodge has held the Arthur B. Freeman Professor of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering position, an endowed professorship approved by the USC president in recognition of exceptional distinction, for 13 years. She also supervises the Hodge Materials Nanotechnology Research group in the aerospace and mechanical engineering department.
“Her efforts have exemplified USC’s commitment to providing a world-class education centered on the diverse needs of undergraduate learners,” Graddy said. “I wish her well in her return to the faculty.”

USC has raised tuition by 3.5% for the 2020-21 academic year, according to a University statement. Full-time students will be expected to pay $59,260. Though the change was made prior to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, it will remain regardless of whether the incoming fall semester remains online or is conducted in-person.
USC foresees increased spending in health expenditures, technology and financial assistance, according to the statement. Other universities including the University of Chicago and the College of William & Mary have announced tuition freezes amid the pandemic. 
“The reality is that the costs of running a university continue to rise each year, and tuition only covers a portion of the cost of a student education,” the University statement read. “We anticipate an even greater need for financial assistance in the coming year, and we remain firm in our commitment to meet the financial needs of our students and their families.”
The tuition announcement follows President Carol Folt’s State of the University address announcing that USC projects an operational deficit of $300-500 million through June 2021 due to costs associated with the pandemic. To help balance the shortfall, the administration implemented pay cuts for higher-up University officials, pauses on discretionary spending and hiring and promotion freezes.
The decision also comes after the University announced in February it would waive tuition for all incoming students with an annual family income at or below $80,000 beginning with first-year students entering in Fall 2020.
With the increase, USC’s tuition and fees will total more than $60,000 for the first time in University history according to the USC Schedule of Classes website. Despite the current circumstances, the University said the change in tuition aligns with rising costs of attendance at other institutions, such as Cornell University, and resembles normal annual tuition raises.
“It mirrors last year’s change in tuition, which was among the smallest percentage increases in 50 years,” the statement read. “This increase, which is in line with our peer universities, will help fund the high-quality education, broad range of outstanding academic programs and important research activities that are the hallmarks of USC.”
USC also currently faces two class action lawsuits for declining to provide partial tuition refunds for the spring semester. The cases follow a communitywide announcement from Provost Charles Zukoski April 28 that the University will not provide prorated tuition or fee refunds despite in-person classes transitioning to virtual instruction early March amid the pandemic.
