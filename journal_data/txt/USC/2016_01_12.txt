The men’s basketball team is off to its best start since the 2008-09 season. The Trojans have already surpassed their win total from last year, and matched their total Pac-12 wins. Head coach Andy Enfield seems to finally have his Trojan squad on the right path after defeating No. 7 Arizona in quadruple overtime Saturday night.
Next up for the Trojans is crosstown rival, UCLA. The Bruins have won six straight against the Trojans, including three blow-outs last season. UCLA has had quite an up and down season thus far, winning games against Gonzaga, Kentucky and Arizona, but losing to the likes of Monmouth and Washington State.
The Trojans and Bruins will enter the game with momentum after both programs swept the Arizona schools over the weekend. Unfortunately for the Trojans, UCLA has dominated them during the Enfield Era. In five games against UCLA, Enfield’s Trojans have been outscored by a total of 98 points, while never losing within single digits.
Last season the trio of guards Bryce Alford and Isaac Hamilton, and forward Tony Parker gave the Trojans fits. Alford scored 21 points with five 3-pointers in an 83-66 victory last January. Parker followed up with 22 points of his own in an 85-74 victory last March and Hamilton dropped 36 points on the Trojans en route to a 96-70 victory in the Pac-12 tournament. Alford, Parker and Hamilton are the three top scorers for the Bruins this season.
While USC has been a sub par program over the past few seasons, the Trojans deserve respect from UCLA this year. The Trojans are another year older after being the youngest team in the Pac-12 last season, and it shows. The Trojans currently have five players averaging double digits in scoring. Junior leaders Julian Jacobs and Nikola Jovanovic are having breakout years, and sophomore sensations Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart are becoming more comfortable in Enfield’s system.
The biggest difference for the Trojans this year has been their three-point shooting. The addition of freshman sniper Bennie Boatwright has helped space the floor for the Trojans. USC is attempting 21 threes per game and is converting 40.9 percent of them, good for 12th in the nation and best in the Pac-12.
The Trojans are also sharing the ball at a higher rate than in previous years. Jacobs and McLaughlin are currently first and third in the Pac-12 with 5.8 and 5.2 assists per game, respectively. That ball movement has helped the Trojans improve their field goal percentage from 42.2 percent a year ago to 46.8 percent this season.
While USC versus UCLA is always about bragging rights in LA, much more is on the line this time around. The AP released its top 25 Monday and the Trojans were the first team out at No. 26, with UCLA following closely behind at No.28. A triumph over UCLA will give the Trojans another quality win for their resume, and could help vault USC into the AP Top 25 for the first time since Nov. 17, 2008.
Tip off is set for 8 Wednesday at Pauley Pavilion. The game will be aired on ESPN 2.

It seemed like an unusual location for the USC football program to hire multiple assistant coaches. I had to double-check what conference the school was in — Conference USA — and what in the world its team name — the Hilltoppers — represented (no explanation, though Wikipedia describes its mascot as a “red, furry blob”).
But when the names of the assistant coaches from Western Kentucky who had been hired by USC came out, the move made much more sense. The Trojans are bringing in the Hilltoppers’ offensive line coach Neil Callaway along with the offensive coordinator Tyson Helton. Tyson, of course, is the younger brother of recently named head coach Clay Helton. Callaway will take over the same position for the Trojans, while the younger Helton will shift to quarterbacks coach and passing game coordinator.
It’d be easy to call the maneuver classic nepotism, and maybe the Trojans will end up having missed out on some of the best assistant coaches in the country. But the elder Helton is shaping up what will be a very strong and unified staff, which will prove to be more important than having some big-name hires.
Critics of the promotion of Helton from the interim to full-time head coach argued that it was a classic example of Athletic Director Pat Haden and the athletic department getting too caught up in nostalgia for the “Trojan Family.”
Instead of looking externally for a potential big-name upgrade, the Trojans went in-house, promoting a coach already with ties to the school as an assistant, to the program head for the third time in a row. After the legendary Pete Carroll left the USC program in some turmoil for the NFL in 2010, Haden tried both Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian, former offensive coordinators under Carroll, as head coaches, but both failed after brief stints.
Looking into the other coaching staff moves Helton and the athletic department have made plays into this idea even further. Helton promoted Tee Martin, the team’s wide receivers coach, to offensive coordinator. For the defensive coordinator, Helton brought back Clancy Pendergast, who served that role for the Trojans in 2013. For special teams, Helton also kept it in the Trojan Family, bringing back John Baxter to fill the special teams coordinator position he had held at USC from 2010 to 2013.
But there was plenty of good reasoning for all five of the major hires Helton has made.
In three of his four seasons at USC, Baxter’s special teams unit ranked in the top 10 in ESPN’s special teams efficiency metric. This past season, under that same title at Michigan, Baxter led the Wolverines to 13th nationally in efficiency after ranking 96th the year before. Anyone who watched Monday’s national championship game could tell you how important that phase of the game is.
Neil Callaway comes with an illustrious career and experience at several different levels. He was an offensive coordinator at Alabama from 1998-2000 and at Georgia from 2001-2006, winning one SEC title with the Crimson Tide and two with the Bulldogs. He’s also had head coach experience at the University of Alabama Birmingham, where he was the program head from 2007-2011. If anything, he seems almost overqualified for a positions coach and should do a great job in the role. Though the younger Tyson comes with much less experience, his Western Kentucky team did win its conference and the Peach Bowl this season, finishing 12-2. The Hilltoppers scored the fifth most points on average in the country at a rate of 44.3 per game.
In arguably the most important move, Helton made a great move in bringing back Pendergast. He was only a coordinator at USC for one season in 2013, but the Trojan defense led the conference that year in defensive efficiency, ranking sixth nationally in ESPN’s ranking. He proved he could do the same elsewhere in the conference, leading Cal’s defensive unit to the best total yardage defense in the Pac-12 in 2010 and 2011. He also brings experience from the next level, having led the Arizona Cardinals as a coordinator to a Super Bowl appearance in 2008. Given the criticism of past coordinator Justin Wilcox, the move was especially important and exciting for fans like me who were there to watch the 2013 season.
Tee Martin is arguably the biggest question mark of the hire. In a position most susceptible to second-guessing, Martin has no experience in an offensive coordinator role beyond the high school level. His best asset might be his recruiting abilities, but his most important duties will now arguably be his playcalling responsibilities. He’s had tremendous success as a college player, succeeding Peyton Manning as the starting quarterback at Tennessee and leading the Volunteers to their most recent national title in 1998, but he will have the most to prove this season.
Overall though, the chemistry and communication between the staff will surely be strong. Everyone has experience working in the Coliseum and under the pressure of the LA media market, and everyone seems to fit with the hardworking and dependable personality of Helton. Ultimately, it will come down more to the players than the staff, but the coaching staff features a savvy and motivated number of football minds that will put the Trojans in the best chance to succeed.

College Football Playoff Executive Director Bill Hancock announced Monday that starting Feb. 1, university President C. L. Max Nikias will be the Chairman of the College Football Playoff Board of Managers.
Nikias will replace former University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Harvey Perlman due to a combination of Perlman’s retirement this upcoming summer, and for Nikias’s pivotal role in the playoff committee during the 2015-2016 season.
“Nikias has been instrumental in the development and growth of the College Football Playoff,” Hancock said in the CFP’s press release. “We appreciate his leadership and continued support. He is highly respected by his fellow presidents and chancellors and he will be an excellent chair.”
With one representative from each NCAA Division I FBS conference, Nikias was a natural choice as the chairman of the Playoff Committee after USC Athletic Director and Pac-12 representative Pat Haden stepped down from his position on the CFP selection committee.
As the chairman and member of the Board of Managers, Nikias will be responsible for leading the Board of Managers and helping to govern the College Football Playoff’s business, property and affairs. The board works to create annual budgets and develop general procedures.
Among the Board of Managers are: Rodney Bennett, University of Southern Mississippi president (C-USA); Anthony Frank, Colorado State University president (Mountain West); Burns Hargis, Oklahoma State University president (Big 12); Jack Hawkins, Troy University chancellor (Sun Belt); Rev. John Jenkins, University of Notre Dame president (Independent), Mark Keenum, Mississippi State University president (SEC), Roderick McDavis, Ohio University president (MAC); Harvey Perlman, University of Nebraska chancellor (Big Ten); John Thrasher, Florida State University president (ACC); and Steadman Upham,  University of Tulsa president (American Athletic).
Although Nikias has not held any positions of responsibility in terms of sports, he has held positions of authority in the USC education system.
Since he was hired at USC in 1991, Nikias has been instrumental in many facets of USC education, serving as a professor, director of national research centers, dean, provost and president along with holding the Robert C. Packard President’s Chair, the Malcolm R. Currie Chair in Technology and the Humanities, the USC Health System Board Chair and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities Chair.
With spring football on the horizon though, Nikias and the College Football Playoff Board of Managers will be busy at work preparing for next season.

It’s more than just a new season for the men’s volleyball team. For the first time in nine years, the program has a new coach. Jeff Nygaard spent the last five years as an assistant under former head coach Bill Ferguson. Nygaard is no stranger to volleyball: he is a three-time Olympian and a two-time College Player of the Year. Nygaard won two National Championships as a collegiate player.
Under Nygaard, the Trojans will have to fill some key positions left by graduated players. Most notably at setter with Micah Christenson — a four-year starter, two-time All-American and Lloyd Ball Award winner — who now sets for the U.S. Men’s National Team. USC will also have to replace a hole in the middle left by Robert Feathers, a three-year starter at middle blocker. Opposite hitter Christian Rivera and middle blocker Chris Lischke also graduated. Outside hitter Larry Tuileta, a 2015 MPSF All-Freshman team selection, did not return for this season.
Last season, the Trojans were 19-9 and 15-7 in the MPSF for a fourth place finish. The Trojans got off to a hot start last season with eight straight wins and advanced to the semifinals in the MPSF Tournament, but the team lost in a five-set match at UC Irvine. The Trojans finished the year with a No. 7 ranking in the nation. The team is currently ranked No. 13 after being swept by both No. 10 Penn State and No. 7 Ohio State.
Despite losing key players and leaders on the court, senior libero Brooks Varni and senior outside hitter Alex Slaught are leading the team on the court as the two captains.
Other than Varni and Slaught, junior middle blocker and two-year starter Andy Benesh will look to carry the Trojans with a solid presence at the net. Benesh spent the summer playing with both the U.S. Men’s Junior National Team and U.S. Men’s National Team. He picked up a silver medal with the Junior National Team at the U21 Pan American Cup. Last season, Benesh led the team with a .394 hitting percentage and 93 blocks. After a successful summer, Benesh should continue to mature as a leader at the net for the Trojans.
“[Benesh’s] dedication to improving will make us a better team,” Nygaard said.
The Trojans also added five talented freshmen this season. Outside hitters Woody Cook, Ryan Moss and Blake Markland, middle blocker Tyler Resnick and libero Matt Douglas. Cook and Moss could also see time at opposite.
“I really think that the freshmen have done a good job of adjusting to a much more rigorous fall than we’ve had in the past,” Slaught said.
Junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder was absent from much of last season, but he rededicated himself to the sport this fall and looks to play near the form that awarded him the 2014 National and MPSF Freshman of the Year honors. As a freshman, Yoder led the team with 394 kills while having a .303 hitting percentage, 111 digs, 33 blocks and 13 aces.
For Nygaard, excellence is what he strives for the team — it’s the “norm” at USC.
“Our focus moving forward is to become sustainably great,” Nygaard said. “Our emphasis in training has been to improve our physicality, our competitiveness and our volleyball IQ.”
The charge under Nygaard has been felt since the team started practicing in the fall. In achieving the excellence that Nygaard talks about, he put early emphasis on his expectations for the team.
“Setting the expectations and establishing the culture has been at the top of the to-do list,” Nygaard said.
Varni noted about how the culture around the team has changed to more of a “business” and “nitty gritty” atmosphere.
“We’re not here to fool around and have fun, but we’re here to compete and to work really hard,” Varni said.
Nygaard’s expectations have translated well to the team. Slaught knows his coach’s expectations for hard work and determination.
“We’re going to come into the gym every day and work as hard as we can [to] give ourselves the best opportunity to be in the contention for a national championship at the end of the year,” Slaught said.

With five returning stat leaders and a strong underclassmen force, the Women of Troy are gearing up for an explosive season in hopes of capturing a fifth NCAA championship.
Finishing third in the 2015 NCAA Tournament, the Trojans had a memorable season. Coach Jovan Vavic received the Pac-12 Coach of the Century Award for winning six consecutive national championships with the men’s team from 2008-2013 (nine titles in his tenure) and an additional four national championships for the women since 2004.
Vavic was not the only one to receive awards from an outstanding 2015 season.
The Trojans who departed in 2015 include stat leader Monica Vavic, who had 100 goals in the 2015 season alone, Eike Daube, Jennifer Stiefel and Jayde Appel. Despite having four graduating seniors after the 2015 season, Coach Vavic is excited to see what the young team will accomplish with freshman goalie Amanda Longan who played for the U.S. Cadet National Team alongside freshman Brooke Presten and helped bring home the gold for Team USA in the 2015 FINA Junior World Championships.
Players to watch this season include sophomore goalie Víctoria Chamorro. Chamorro totaled 207 saves as a true freshman and received All-American and All-MPSF honorable mentions while also being selected to the MPSF All-Newcomer Team. On offense, the Trojans will be returning the Haralabidis sisters, Ioanna and Stephania, who shared a total of 114 goals in the 2015 season and played together for the Greek National Team in the 2015 FINA World Championship, and sophomore utility Hayley McKelvey who also made an appearance in the 2015 FINA Junior World Championships, representing Canada. Mckelvey scored 20 goals in 16 games in her freshman season and has also represented Canada in the 2012 and 2014 FINA Youth World Championships.
Ending the season 4-2 in MPSF and 24-6 overall, the team has been ranked 2nd in the 2016 pre-season coaches poll trailing a point behind No. 1 Stanford and one point ahead of No. 3 UCLA, indicating close match-ups to come during MPSF play.
While No. 1 seeded Stanford returned many players from the previous season, they’ve also lost three key players, Kiley Neushal, Maggie Steffens and Ashley Grossman, who took time off to embark on their Olympic journey to Rio de Janiero this summer. With key rival players out for the season, the Trojans hope to win a fifth national title under Vavic.
On Jan. 13th and 16th, the Women of Troy will face off in a series of pre-season scrimmages against Team Shanghai and then embark on their season opening match against UC San Diego in February.

USC students have a history of actively supporting worthwhile causes encompassing a diverse set of issues. Reading the Dec. 2 piece “Students advocate for solar panel installation” inspired me to voice my own opinion on campus sustainability efforts and a specific initiative we may be missing out on.
USC has already taken big steps in decreasing its carbon footprint, particularly within its Hospitality Department. USC Hospitality donates unused food, recycles kitchen grease and sources its food locally. Although these efforts are important and should not go unnoticed, there is always room to achieve more. By simply shifting mayonnaise and cookie dough suppliers, USC could dramatically decrease its environmental impact. Hundreds of universities and corporations, including Cornell, UC Berkeley, University of Connecticut, 7-11 and Google, have collaborated with a new food tech startup, Hampton Creek. Hampton Creek’s two predominant products, Just Mayo and Just Cookies, are invariably delicious, lack most common allergens and happen to be egg-free — an ingredient omission which has spared millions of grams of carbon emissions.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that animal agriculture, including egg and dairy production, accounts for 18 percent of global greenhouse emissions. In addition to reducing our campus carbon footprint even further, making the switch to Hampton Creek’s Just Mayo and Just Cookies would save thousands of gallons of water and square feet of land, accomplishments that should not be understated given the current developments in our understanding of climate change and the degradation of our planet.
With so many great sustainability initiatives having been started at USC, the nearly undetectable switch to different products seems to align perfectly with our values. Knowing our student population and progressive Hospitality Department, I have no doubt that a partnership with Hampton Creek lies in our future.

With so many sitcoms and reality shows on TV, it’s refreshing to see an original idea come to the airwaves. They don’t always pan out, but they’re so few and far between that it’s good to know that originality will never be a thing of the past. Fox’s new show Second Chance is fresh with many interesting relationships, fueled by a loveable main character, and ideas to explore.
The premise of the show is intriguing, which is enough of a reason to give it a chance. Former Seattle sheriff Jimmy Pritchard (Phillip Baker Hall) is old, retired and maintains a rocky relationship with his son, Duval Pritchard (Tim DeKay). He’s a shell of what he once was, but he’s kept a few bad traits, including his womanizing, alcoholism and my-way-or-the-highway attitude. One night, he stumbles upon intruders in his son’s house, an encounter that leads to his death, officially ending his days as Jimmy Pritchard. Or so he thought. He is brought back to life by the tech-giant billionaire twins Otto (Adhir Kalyan) and Mary (Dilshad Vadsaria) in an enhanced, and much younger body (Rob Kazinsky), and his first order of business is to figure out why he was murdered.  He also seeks to protect his son.
A good premise can only carry a show so far, so it’s a good thing that the show lays down the groundwork of many plot elements to be explored later, including the dynamics of the complicated relationships that Pritchard has made over the years, especially with his family. His son wants nothing to do with him, but Pritchard is determined to keep his son out of danger now that he has a new body that allows him to keep a close eye on him. His daughter has picked up a few of his bad habits and, unlike her brother, still loves her father.
Pritchard opens another can of worms when it comes to the new relationship he shares with one of his surrogate parents, Mary. She is responsible for keeping him alive and guiding him through this new experience. It’s a learning process for both, so there are some kinks that need to be worked through. They both need each other, but it’s unclear which one needs the other more, since Mary has inoperable cancer, and the only thing that seems to be keeping her from dying is Pritchard’s blood.
This also affects Mary’s relationship with her brother, Otto, who is the brains behind their shared tech conglomerate that rivals Google and Facebook. Otto has a mental disease that prevents him from communicating with the outside world, and instead communicates through his sister. If Mary dies, his brilliance may be lost in the world, and Pritchard finds himself in an interesting position where he has a new family that depends on him, much like how his kids depended on him a long time ago. His second chance in life gives him many other second chances: the chance to be a better father, man and sheriff.
Of course, there’s also Pritchard’s relationship with himself. He’s made plenty of mistakes in his life, and he’s undoubtedly done things of which he is not proud of. The obvious being that he wasn’t the best father to his children, but also how he handled being the sheriff of the town. His work ethic of doing what needs to be done to put the bad guys away led to his inevitable and disgraceful firing, but with his new body, he has the chance to clear his name and become a better sheriff than he was before.
Kazinsky is a fantastic casting choice. He is great at playing a man who has the body of a younger man, but having the wise mind of an older man. Kazinsky looks young enough to play the part, but it’s compelling to watch his mannerisms and the delivery of his lines that are a healthy mix of youth and old age. He’s charismatic, but he can also be a grumpy old man and it’s hard not to fall in love with the character by the end of the first episode. He’s sly, he’s brash and he plans to do things differently with the new chance he’s been given.
Second Chance is an innovative idea that’s looking to break the mold of typical shows on Fox’s lineup. Whether or not it’ll do so remains to be seen, but it looks promising. The potential in its plot points and relationships and its strong lead might lead it to greatness, but only time will tell. Regardless, Second Chance is a show that should find its way into the rotation of anyone who’s looking for something new to watch this year.

Pop music lost British icon David Bowie Sunday when he lost his battle against cancer just days after his 69th birthday. Bowie touched the lives of everyone in the arts, from fashionistas to filmmakers and musicians alike. As a singer, songwriter and producer, Bowie excelled during his 40-plus year career.
On Friday, Bowie released his 25th album Blackstar, which many are calling “a parting gift.” On Monday, Blackstar peaked at number one on the U.S. iTunes albums chart.  The album art includes hospital beds and worshipped skulls. The final two songs seem especially fitting. In “Dollar Days,” an acoustic ballad, Bowie repeatedly sings that he’s “dying to” defy expectations, followed by a reflective electronic song where Bowie sings about leaving people wanting for more.
Bowie continued challenging the public and making great contributions to music until the very end. His artistic breakthrough came with 1972’s The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars, an album that fostered the idea of a rock star as a space alien. Bowie had created a flamboyant, androgynous alter ego: Ziggy Stardust.
Three years later, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number one single “Fame.” Other memorable songs include “Golden Years,” “Let’s Dance,” “Space Oddity,” “Heroes,” “Changes” and “Under Pressure,” among others.
Bowie also pursued an acting career. He was applauded for his three-month Broadway stint in The Elephant Man in 1980, starred in Marlene Dietrich’s last film, Just a Gigolo, and appeared in Martin Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ.
He also produced albums for artists such as Lou Reed and Iggy Pop and earned a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 2006. He had maintained a low profile since 2006, re-emerging in 2013 with the album The Next Day, which catapulted to No. 2 on the Billboard 200. It became his highest-charting album.
If anyone needs any proof of the breadth of Bowie’s influence on music and culture, look no further than the many tributes that have rightfully sparked out over the last few days. Late night television paid tribute to Bowie Monday night. Conan O’Brien shared a montage of the numerous times Bowie stopped by Late Night, not just as a musical guest, but also someone eager to joke around with the host. In the clip, Bowie is victim to O’Brien’s schemes, including a photo history of Bowie’s fake onstage personas and a personalized O’Brien song.
“Such a lovely man,” O’Brien said after the montage.
Over on The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon also remembered Bowie.
“We’d actually emailed each other jokes now and then. He was brilliant and sharp and dark and funny,” Fallon said.
A number of Bowie’s friends and fellow artists also paid tribute to the star via Twitter and Facebook.
American singer Iggy Pop hailed Bowie as “the light of my life. I never met such a brilliant person. He was the best there is,” he tweeted.
New Zealand sensation Lorde also took to Twitter to describe the loss, saying, “I’ve never met a hero of mine and liked it. David was different.”
Film director Guillermo Del Toro, who has described himself as a huge fan, said, “Bowie existed so all of us misfits learned that an oddity was a precious thing. He changed the world forever.”
A memorial concert is planned for New York’s Carnegie Hall in memory of Bowie. The concert will feature 20 artists and will  include performances by The Roots, Bettye Lavette and Robyn Hitchcock.

I never used to make friends in class. I would come right on time, sit by the door and leave as soon as lecture ended. No time for chitchat. But last semester, in some twist of fate, I attracted a community of near-door sitters, who too had no time for chitchat. Somehow, chitchat we did. The bond never extended beyond the confines of the curriculum, but a camaraderie blossomed nonetheless, and out of our hesitant alliance, I developed a class crush.
The attraction was just as anomalous as the friendship had been — our interests were totally dissimilar. But I liked his hair. It was shiny and flowed like honey. I liked his voice and what he said. He was passionate, and it didn’t really matter that we weren’t passionate about the same things.
I joked about my crush keeping class interesting. I smirked and solicited advice to take our bond beyond academia. I asked questions mostly out of irony — my friends knew of my in-class social ineptitude — but I did want to make it happen and felt pretty confident that I could. I just needed perfect timing.
I wanted to flag him down after the last class and say something such as, “I find you very attractive. You have my number, call me sometime.” In my mind, I’d leave him stunned and cast a flirtatious glance over my shoulder. But I didn’t want to disrupt the table arrangements for the final. If he was put off by my advance and didn’t want to sit with me, it would stress me out during the test. His perpendicular presence had become oddly reassuring and I didn’t want to go without it while taking a final. I decided to wait.
To make it actually happen, I needed to work myself up to being as bold as possible. I went to the “guru.” The guru is the bite to my bark. Her seduction advice is infallible and she used to know my honey-haired honey. She told me I should text him at precisely 10:30 p.m., asking if he was single. According to the guru, 10:30 p.m. is early enough that you’re probably sober but late enough that you might not be. Early enough that he won’t be drunk but late enough that he might not be sober. Most importantly, it’s early enough for a rendezvous later that night but also late enough to make time another day. He may take a while to respond but he would respond favorably.
I was almost certain Honey was single, so asking seemed excessive. Instead, I crafted and drafted and stewed between study breaks but to my surprise, he texted me first. “How are you studying?” It would be so easy to invite him over and segue into not studying, that is if I was suave. But another classmate messaged us both before I had time to plot, asking to meet the next morning.
When the final time came, Honey and I waited together, early but still by the door. Toward the end of the test, I could see him fidgeting and realized he was waiting for me. We closed our blue books in unison, rose at the same time, and he opened the door for me. My chance handed to me on a silver platter.
“How’d it go?” That’s what I got out before we were no longer alone in the hallway, before we were talking to classmates, before we had places to be. Text it was.
I arranged to go out with my former roommate that night, so that the possibility of rejection wouldn’t loom so large. I had already written my message and cleared it with the guru and my old roommate, so I could just hit send later. We lost ourselves in cider, conversation and Broad City for five hours until I could send it and the nervousness dissipated. I even sent it a few minutes early. But by hour four with no word I was stressed again, scrolling through picture after picture of him with cute Asian girls on Facebook.
By hour five, I was drunk at Jack in the Box. My old roommate and I shared the sick satisfaction of devouring a large fry. That’s what mattered to me. She had been abroad with me, lived with me, split meals and coauthored many text-seductions. The guru had guided me from banter to action, giving me the confidence to follow through on my fantasies. I cherished them far more than I ever would Honey.
Finally, my phone mumbled Honey. “Thanks! I’ll keep in touch.”
Days of obsessing, drafting, polling, plotting — for that. I took a screenshot. “WRONG,” said the guru.
“He sent THAT?!!?” said the old roommate. “He did. I’m over it,” I said back, and meant it. I had no guy and no game, but I had my girls and that’s all I needed.

Marissa Renteria | Daily Trojan
New York University, under pressure following a publicity nightmare, recently restructured its application policy in order to provide fee waivers to low-income students. Even though NYU has a need-blind admissions process, until very recently, the university denied most requests for application fee waivers from disadvantaged students.  As a result, the policy prevented entry to NYU for applicants from low-income backgrounds, even though finances should not play a part in the evaluation of their merit.
The reversal in policy from NYU came only four days after the NYU Tisch School of the Arts refused to offer a waiver for the $65 application fee to applicant Joshua Jackson, who posted an email chain with an admissions officer, inciting public outrage. Dan Sanford, the director of graduate admissions at the Tisch School, explained to Jackson in an email that the original fee waiver policy was in place because “if $65 is a hardship for you, how will you be able to pay the tuition of $60,000?” As a result of the backlash, NYU changed its policy to emphasize the university’s commitment to diversity and reaffirmed that it will ensure that application fee waivers are granted to all students with legitimate financial need.
While Jackson’s actions were ultimately successful in changing NYU’s policy online, the original policy itself calls into question the commitment of the university to diversify its student body. If NYU claims to desire diversity, and also claims to have a need-blind admissions process, then it must ensure that applicants can apply regardless of their financial backgrounds.
Applications are the knock on the door to higher education — they are not a guarantee of admittance or a financial aid package. If a potential student has legitimate financial need, and a university has declared that it wants to pursue diversity in its student body, then it must be prepared to make decisions that take into account the fact that not everyone in a diverse student body can pay even an application fee out of pocket.
Running a premier university necessarily incurs massive administrative costs, and application fees exist to help offset the cost of evaluating applications. Though NYU has a $3.5 billion endowment, it only spends 7 percent of its operating budget for administrative purposes. Given that the Tisch School alone received almost 3,000 applications last year, and the individual $65 fees from each application add up to nearly $200,000 collectively, application evaluations represent a considerable revenue to the university. That being said, to some prospective students, a $65 application fee can be a substantial strain. That strain, however, does not reflect their ability as a student or their prospects post-graduation, which should be NYU’s primary concerns.
What Sanford seemed to forget in his exchange with Jackson, besides the goal of diversity, is that admittance to a university is a sign of faith in the student’s ability and a vehicle for social mobility. Simply being allowed the chance to be evaluated shouldn’t depend on potentially insurmountable financial barriers. After all, the purpose of college is mainly to advance career prospects, giving individuals the chance to escape low socioeconomic status through merit. If that chance is not extended to people because of their inability to pay an application fee, then the college admissions process at a school like NYU is not truly need-blind.
This sort of inclusivity and social mobility is why a truly need-blind admissions process is important to maintain, including offering application fee waivers. Luckily, USC is one of 103 universities that maintain a need-blind admissions process. NYU is also on the list, however, which calls into question the trustworthiness of need-blind admissions processes across the country. Universities exist to invest in the future of their students and society, much like how students invest their time and money into their own education. The primary considerations of universities such as USC and NYU should be the contributions of their students to the world and their ability to succeed on and off campus. Application fees, on the other hand, are not nearly as critical for the reputation and operation of large universities. In cases of legitimate need, they should be waived, especially if a university purports to seek diversity in its student body.
No sarcasm, but I genuinely don’t get it. “This sort of inclusivity and social mobility is why a truly need-blind admissions process is important to maintain, including offering application fee waivers.” If the application process is “need blind” does that not mean that the application process is the same for everybody, needy or not? Look at this way:  The application process should be “religion blind,” meaning that it sees no religion of the applicant. The application is not “need blind” if it provides different treatment based on the student’s financial ability to come up with the application fee. Another point:  If the fee is $65, NYU or any college has the cost of personnel, computers, etc. to process applications. Is $65 unfair? Only if one knows the cost to NYU. If they are making an inappropriately large, greedy profit from applications, maybe $65 is unfair. Finally, if no application fee because the student claims to be needy, does this not mean a lot of extra applications, costing NYU, for the needy who actually have no business applying because they are not even qualified? Please explain, if you understand. I don’t.

Larycia Hawkins, a political science professor at Wheaton College, was suspended last month for a Facebook post that read: “I stand in religious solidarity with Muslims because they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated … We worship the same God.” At the same time, she announced that she would wear a hijab as a physical manifestation of religious solidarity. In a statement released by Wheaton College, it is clear that Hawkins’s ill-advised suspension resulted from her post which grouped Islam and Christianity as one.
The actions of Wheaton College come as no surprise, given the anti-Muslim hysteria that permeated in the media after the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. As an institution of higher education, however, the college must be held to a higher standard of social responsibility. Through the lens of Wheaton College administrators, it seems as though Christian “love thy neighbor” principles do not apply to Muslims. Hawkins asked, “How well does Wheaton College care for its neighbor in Syria, in the south side of Chicago and in Soweto. And what if the neighbor in the south side happens to be Muslim?”
In fact, in doing so, the college inadvertently mirrors the very same rhetoric, image and intolerance it works so virulently disassociate from — that of Islamic clerics, fundamentalists and jihadists. The “othering” of religions separate from Islam is central to the jihadist cause, and irresponsible measures such as Hawkins’s case only work to strengthen the sentiment behind that cause.
The college also said that, “While Islam and Christianity are both monotheistic, we believe there are fundamental differences between the two faiths, including what they teach about God’s revelation to humanity, the nature of God, the path to salvation and the life of prayer.” While the truth behind this statement is questionable, the bigotry and xenophobia behind it are not. Above all else, the college’s actions have completely skewed Hawkins’s intent to show that a Christian should condemn any form of hate and discrimination of all members of humanity — Christian or not. It is important to note that Hawkins herself did not compare the practices of Christianity, as cited in Wheaton’s statement on the nature of God and Christian prayer, to that of its Islamic counterpart — but rather, like Christianity, Islam is an Abrahamic religion and deserves respect during a time of oppression and discrimination.
The nature of Wheaton’s disciplinary measures is also latent with Islamophobia. By brashly and quickly dismantling the link between Islam and Christianity, the college adds to the criminalization of everyday, non-fundamental Muslims and their image and association as followers of an Abrahamic religion. According to the college’s mission statement, the institution stands to ultimately “benefit society worldwide” — if this is the case, then why does the college fail to offer its hand in faith to Muslims? Clearly, Wheaton College sees those who follow Islam as outside of the label “society.”
At time where women wearing hijab are harassed, beaten and killed, political candidates scream for all Muslims to be kicked out of the U.S. and mosques everywhere are the target of hate crimes and sacrilegious vandalism, it is utterly heart-breaking to see yet another manifestation of discrimination. This is just one of many streamlined acts of isolation.
As a Muslim, I find it debilitating to be “othered” constantly, have to explain myself routinely and live in fear incessantly.  I am tired of people shaming Islam with prejudiced rhetoric. It is considerably irresponsible for a college with as much recognition as Wheaton, dubbed the Harvard of Christian schools, to degrade a religion instead of understanding it. I expect much more from an institution of higher education. The school must issue a timely apology to both Hawkins and the Muslim community. Instead, however, the college has begun the firing process for her.
Above all else, Hawkins should be praised for her acts of solidarity despite heavy criticism and professional repercussions. It is people like her who genuinely work to “benefit society worldwide.” Hawkins deserves to be commended for showing that Christians and Muslims alike should get what they deserve: dignity and humanity.

This post has been updated for clarity. 
It all depends on worship the same God is.  Wheaton College is a college that teaches evangelizing the lost. Most at the college believe that Muslims need to be witnessed to to convert them.  So if she believe that Muslims worship the same God but are not saved then she will be welcomed back.  If she means that Muslims do not need to be saved then she is going to have a problem staying at the College.
This target rich environment deserves a more deliberate dissection. I have snatched a copy and, time permitting, will expose the errors at Crusader’s Armory.
I condemn hatred, bigotry, intolerance, imperialism, genocide & terrorism: ISLAM.
Lida’s article might be OK, if Wheaton were a public university, or a non-sectarian one, like USC. But it has presented itself as a Christian college and need not tolerate religious declarations by instructors conflicting with the college’s religious doctrine. The instructor made such a declaration, after having pledged to live and teach consistent with Wheaton’s religious doctrine. Instructor Hawkins violated her pledge. So Wheaton College suspended her to reinforce its policy. Simple as that.
This had NOTHING to do with Islam or wearing a head scarf.  Professor Larycia Hawkins was removed from a Christian university because she signed a statement of her Christian faith and to uphold the Christian faith in her position and recent her statements rejects Jesus and she has never reversed that position.  
The god of Islam is simply not God, regardless of what Larycia Hawkins or Pope Francis may say to the contrary. It may be ‘So Racist!’ to say so, and certainly unpopular, but there no alternate routes to salvation and eternal life apart from Jesus Christ and His redemptive work on the cross.
Yes, allah is actually Satan. The Bible and the koranus make that clear.
Indeed – openly hostile to Jesus Christ and to Christians and Jews, and destined to spend eternity in the lake of fire.
Consigned there along with the beast and the false prophet (Rev. 20:10).
Indeed, and the false prophet of Islam will be there too, unless he accepted Jesus Christ as his saviour instead of denying His deity and crucifixion.
I suspect he’s already there.
I am not the judge, but I have seen nothing to suggest that he rejected Islam prior to his death.
No, his aorta didn’t either. ;-)
Yain’t seen it ‘cuz there ain’t any.
I thought not.
According to Islamic aquidah, Moe is alive in his grave, either haveing been shown his place in Jannah or Jannahm. In the latter case, being tormented in the most horrific ways as he awaits judgment day. See the chapter on Punishments of the Grave in Mishkat ul-Misabih. If memory serves, its in the first volume which you may have difficulty finding.
I wouldn’t trust anything they say. They don’t know squat and have no clue.
Its fantasy, of cuss, but they believe it.
Anyone who believes the Burak story is a deluded fool.
U mean the miraj ;)
That’s the one. Many people left his cult that day.
He was sleeping in some other gal’s house when he had the nightmare. Ibn Sa’d tells about it.
It was his cousin. He was diddling her. He snuck into her house then panicked when they got onto him. He shot out the back and they caught him there. So he concocted the story. The Prophet of Doom website has a brilliant write up of it based on the hadiths.

Aisha’s account reveals that he cursed us on his deathbead so that Abu Bakr drove them out of the Hijaz.
But Sahih Bukhari,  Sahih Muslim & Ibn Sa’d are required for the final probative evidence.
Yep.
Of what race is Jehovah a member? What is Allah’s race? Did Jehovah communicate revelations to his Prophets through “the musical instrument of Satan” as Allah did to Moe? 
Which Hebrew Prophet was demon possessed?
What must a Muslim do to be assured of salvation, according to Allah?
Hogwash! There’s no such thing.
While muslims may question the truth of “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me”, they reject that truth at their peril. Everything to do with redemption of fallen, sinful mankind, and nothing to do with ‘bigotry and xenophobia’.
Not to mention that this alleged pislamophobia is nothing but a fabrication.
It is simply a label used to deflect attention from allah’s evil scheme to hijack Creation and set itself up as ‘lord of the worlds’, instead of ‘lord of the flies’.
Indeed. Just ignore the man behind the curtain.
As so many do.
Merkel, for example.
Delve into Guillaume’s “The Life Of Muhammad” [Ishaq’s Sira]
If memory serves, pages 510-511 reveal what he prayed to and what he prayed for and it ain’t pretty.
Moe co-opted Abraham, Moses & Jesus as Muslims, but there were no Muslims prior to 610 when Moe began contriving the war cult, and in the Unholy Koranus, it is revealed that he was “commanded to be the first of the believers”,
Yes, he’s nothing but a liar.
Moreover, a psychotic barbarian warlord.
With a penchant for little girls.

Arthur Brooks’s column, published late last month in The New York Times, pulled no punches in criticizing inaction by policymakers and activists on both sides of the political spectrum. He claimed American society has fallen to “victimhood culture,” in which leaders are too busy fighting over their status as under attack to engage in productive discussions about policy solutions.
Brooks’s concerns aren’t unique; over the past year, discussions over victimhood have become a common issue, especially in American universities. Misunderstandings over “safe spaces,” forums where marginalized groups can engage in meaningful dialogue without dominant stereotypes, have fractured student bodies at universities like the University of Missouri and Claremont McKenna College. Political candidates are consistently accused of tapping into middle and lower-class Americans’ resentment of social inequality and instilling fires of political revolution. It’s not hard to view American politics as, in his words, a “grievance industry.”
Brooks’s complaints, however, fail to provide a solution and downplay the concerns of real victims behind his overarching commentary on victimhood culture. Similarly, rhetoric about victimhood culture neglects harsh political realities where marginalized students are granted less respect. Steps toward healing must begin with a recognition of victims’ stories, not a criticism of their tone.
One of the author’s most interesting conclusions instructs citizens to fight for real victims, yet conflates the safe space struggle with fatalistic complaint. This skepticism is too familiar; university administrators have consistently decried that what seems to be a new oversensitivity to offensive content censors and disrupts learning. But these arguments deny broader contextual factors, like years of resentment built up over glaring inequities across college campuses. The emphasis on student “coddling” repeatedly referenced in public media also results in shrunken cultural centers or legacy admission cycles that reify privileges of wealth and race outside of college. Neglecting victims perpetuates cycles of inequities that spill over into public discourse.
This has real implications. The “coddled collegiate” stereotype, where students are too busy policing their learning environments to actually be challenged, reflects a world where people assume all students have protected, cookie-cutter experiences in higher education. Steps toward healing begin with a recognition of victims, not a weak delineation of “true” and “fake” victim advocacy that filters out what does not want to be heard.
The opportunity to look at social change from a perspective motivated by “hope and opportunity,” as Brooks puts it, is an advantage not afforded to many, especially the underprivileged. He identifies victimhood with apathy toward progressivism, citing a social experiment where subjects wrote essays expressing how they had been wronged in their lives and then engaged in collaborative tasks. His analogy highlights a personal distance between his own narrative and that of actual victims; writing about being wronged is, in any sense, incomparable to histories of political activism. Painting this work as a selfish maneuver to police public forums is merely a refusal to believe in the accounts of the marginalized.
Most of those who proxy as the neutral chorus decrying victimhood have the luxury of describing this victimhood without attachment to their personal experience. The value of truth in victims’ claims is obvious, but a response forcing them to interrogate their own “complaints” belies a history of disrespect that denied the claims of marginalized people. For instance, stereotypes of welfare queens that dominate food stamp debates made arbitrary delineations between the “good” and “bad” recipients to justify reductions. In addition, anti-rape activism on college campuses arose from a culture in which victims’ stories were routinely discounted, not a “shutting out” of different voices. The responsibility lands on listeners to trust victims, not victims to prove themselves.
Specifically, according to a New York Times article by Judith Shulevitz, college students are not just “hiding from scary ideas” with an armor of victimhood. All too often, their ideas are discredited in public forums or by university administrators. Almost 90 percent of American full-time faculty are white, and only a third are women. Unacceptable rates of unaddressed campus sexual assault and male-dominated faculty are why some students have trouble approaching the “scary ideas” of college. A solid majority of graduates from top law schools like Harvard and Yale come exclusively from the top 10 percent of American earners. Only 5 percent come from the bottom half. University spaces are consistently uphill struggles for those without socioeconomic privilege; first steps toward reform are impossible without a basic trust in the stories of these students.
USC is not excluded from these accusations. The University is blessed to have a diverse student body and campus leaders who are passionate about respect and dignity for faculty, workers and students. Safe spaces where students have been able to fully explore their identities and the histories behind them have been integral for scholars and activists on campus. If victimhood culture means anything, it is not the locking out of voices but rather the empowerment of marginalized ones. It does not result in the reduction of people into “aggrieved masses,” but rather a charge to the “hope and opportunity” Brooks supports.

The SoCal VoCals, USC’s oldest a cappella group, performed at the White House for President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama at a holiday reception for members of the White House staff and their families over winter break.
According to SoCal VoCals President Jonathan von Mering, one of the main reasons the group was selected was their excellent track record in collegiate a cappella competition.
“We compete in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella,” von Mering said. “We’ve won it four times since 2008, and then we were invited this fall by the White House Social Office to sing at a holiday reception.”
In order to afford to travel to Washington, D.C., the SoCal VoCals presented to USG to see if they would be able to fund their trip. Professional Funding Board Director Christian Edwards noted that the determination and strong communication of the SoCal VoCals was crucial to figuring out the logistics of getting them to the White House.
“They made it very clear that they were very determined and passionate about what they were doing and you can’t pass up a unique opportunity like this,” Edwards said.
Myles Nuzzi, the president of the SoCal VoCals last semester, was the one who presented to USG about what the SoCal VoCals’ plans were to make this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity into reality.
“Their presentation was absolutely stellar, unique and outstanding,” Edwards said. “When Myles initially contacted me his initial enthusiasm was great for what he saw this would be for the SoCal VoCals and what this could do for their future in terms of the unique opportunity it offered.”
Nuzzi elaborated that he felt that the SoCal VoCals performing at the White House validated them as professional musicians instead of just a group of college students.
“I think that performing at the White House shows that we are not just a college group but a professional vocal group,” Nuzzi said. “While we are a collegiate group, we treat ourselves as a professional business of musicians and once someone sees that we performed at the White House people will understand”
The audience aided the set itself, which consisted of Christmas carols and other holiday songs. The White House staff and their families managed to keep a professional performance lighthearted and fun.
“It’s a professional setting but it was also really fun because it was a party for the staff and their families,” Nuzzi said. “So there were little kids dancing and singing along with us. We were able to have a good time while treating it like a professional performance.”
According to Becky Yim, a freshman majoring in philosophy who just joined the SoCal VoCals last fall, getting the chance to perform for the Obamas set a high bar for the rest of her USC experience.
“Definitely as a new student, I did not expect to look back on my first semester and be like ‘Wow I met the president of the United States.’ That’s pretty cool.”
And even on the other side of the country the SoCal VoCals were able to see members of the Trojan Family making an impact in the White House.
“The person basically running the whole show was a USC grad, and [the White House staffer] had told [President Obama], ‘You should tell them to ‘Fight On.’ They’ll love that’,’ Nuzzi said. “So he comes in and says ‘Looks like there’s a couple of Trojans in here!’ And we thought ‘He knows!’ Then at the end [Obama] told us to ‘Fight On’ and gave us the ‘Fight On’ sign. It was kind of cool that we go across the country and a USC grad is running the show and interacting with Obama.”

Following the passage of a resolution addressing campus-wide issues of discrimination, USC administrators, faculty members, student leaders and community members have been working to implement changes in the University’s approach towards diversity, equity and inclusion on campus.
The Campus Climate Resolution was introduced in the Undergraduate Student Senate on Oct. 20 and passed on Nov. 10; it went through in the Graduate Student Senate on Oct. 19. The initiative came in response to student activism on campus and reports of discrimination from several students, including USG President Rini Sampath.
Campus protests on Nov. 12 ended with the delivery of a letter, demanding a meeting with key administrators, to the offices of President C.L. Max Nikias. Later that day, student leaders and key authors of the resolution met with Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and Provost Michael Quick to discuss the administration’s response to student demands.
In an email memorandum sent to USC students on Nov. 16, Quick outlined the University’s official response to the resolution, including the administration’s commitment to diversity as well as the specific actions that would be taken to address student concerns. Since the release of the memorandum, student leaders have been working with administration to implement these changes, starting with the creation of a diversity task force to spearhead the effort.
The task force — which includes three undergraduate students, two graduate students and three faculty members, as well as Carry and Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni — was created to gather information and implement the action items in the resolution.
“Solving these issues of discrimination, prejudice. It’s not going to happen overnight,” Sampath said. “We need to come from a very thoughtful perspective”
The University has also committed to establishing diversity forums — monthly meetings open to all students to discuss issues of inclusion and discrimination on campus — throughout 2016, and has planned out all the topics for the rest of the year. Other ways for students to get involved, including USG Senate subcommittees and general body meetings, provide a direct channel for students hoping to stay informed with the progression of the resolution and bring in their own input and personal experiences.
Issues such as the demand for transparency, outlined in the resolution as a request to “provide easily understood flowcharts or infographics of the process for reporting incidences of bias,” have been addressed in stages. Although administrators have worked to provide minutes of task force meetings and establish a website where students can submit their personal stories, resolution authors worry that these efforts don’t receive enough student input.
“It’s a very curated, narrowly contextualized visualization of what progress looks like,” said Alex Kanegawa, a student worker of Asian Pacific American Student Services. “Although it’s modeled after UCLA’s diversity website, I think where they went wrong is that we don’t have a person who is directly accountable for this whole process.”
As a result, students fear that the website may downplay or leave out information about student complaints or issues, which would hinder progress in the long run.
“This process of creating change needs to be ongoing, so being accountable to the mistakes that we make in these conversations is really important,” said Alyssa Coffey, director of the Queer & Ally Student Assembly. “Having a way that we can look at what we’re doing, see our thought process, and criticize as we move forward is an invaluable tool to creating a process for cyclical change.”
Many of the same issues arose with the University appointment of Diversity Liaisons for each academic school; student leaders claim that although the move demonstrates a willingness to move forward and make change, it doesn’t provide the accountability that the student body needs.
“Students didn’t have any hand in choosing [the diversity liaisons] — none of [the resolution authors] were asked, even though we represent several disciplines across this University,” USG Senator Sabrina Enriquez said.
According to Kanegawa, the expansion of cultural centers has progressed slowly; several changes, however, have been implemented. The Office of International Services has been moved to an on-campus location, and the LGBT Center received a student lounge; APASS was able to appoint a new director, although it still employs only one dedicated staff member.
“There’s been an active push to move the cultural centers away from this conversation,” Kanegawa said. “With the push towards centralization, the cultural centers are considered more of a student affairs issue rather than a diversity issue.”
Many of the demands in the original resolution, however, have not been addressed by either the diversity memorandum or the work of the task force. According to Coffey, calls to establish a Vice President of Diversity have repeatedly been rebuffed on the grounds that a single dedicated position would detract from each individual student’s responsibility to uphold inclusion and diversity on campus.
“To be truly effective in improving our campus climate in the long term, it must be woven into the fabric of all we do, and be a responsibility that we all share,” Quick said in the memorandum. “Given the breadth of this university, I believe this broad approach will be the most effective in addressing these issues.”
Although the University agreed to consider the resolution’s demands to establish a Title IX coordinator, who would work in conjunction with the existing position of Title IX investigator to address violations of the law, no action has been taken. Student requests to establish a $100 million fund to support scholarships for minority students have also been denied, although Visions and Voices will direct $100,000 of its annual funding to diversity programming; calls to reinstate the diversity requirement for General Education have also been disregarded.
Although some praise the administration for responding to what many see as a long-standing problem, others maintain that the University is still not doing nearly enough to address the issues that many students continue to face.
“We are going to keep pushing,” Coffey said. “It’s an ongoing cycle – it’s not going to stop in May”

Provost Michael Quick released a comprehensive sustainability plan for the University called Sustainability 2020 in an e-mail memorandum to students. Created by the 2014-15 Sustainable Steering Committee, a group composed of faculty, staff and student representatives, the plan describes 17 sustainability goals in the areas of engagement, energy conservation, transportation, procurement, waste diversion and water conservation.
“As USC rises to meet the powerful challenges of the 21st century, environmental sustainability must take priority in our teaching, research, operations and facilities,” Quick told USC News. “Sustainability 2020 provides a framework for progress and accountability to the USC community, the greater Los Angeles area and even to the world on how we will focus our work in this critical area.”
The plan comes five years after the Campus Planning Committee of the Board of Trustees passed campus sustainability resolutions and one year after the Undergraduate Student Government formed the Environmental Student Assembly.
Noteworthy goals include efforts to increase environmental literacy in science curricula, use campuses as “living laboratories” for sustainability and increase awareness about alternative transportation, waste reduction and water conservation practices.
By 2020, the plan envisions 75 percent waste diversion levels, a 25 percent decrease in potable water use, 25 percent sustainable food purchase levels and 75 percent participation of USC departments and offices in responsible purchasing practices.
While the plan has been met with student support, some sustainability advocates on campus see the plan as a core framework rather than an end goal. Shawn Rhoads, a senior double majoring in physics and psychology and a member of the committee responsible for the plan, said that though the plan is comprehensive, the University should pursue larger objectives.
“When we see these numbers — 25 percent potable water use reduction by 2020 — we want to aim for higher than that, but that’s our baseline achievement goal,” Rhoads said. “We should be trying to increase what we want to accomplish.”
The Sustainability Steering Committee will collaborate with subcommittees and other university officials to implement the goals presented in the plan.
“This is something that requires a lot of important departments — of operations, of research, of academia,” Rhoads said. “To accomplish this vision that we see for the university, we need everyone to be on the same page.”

The 2016 election will be the first to allow Undergraduate Student Government members to vocally support any president-vice presidential ticket or senatorial candidate and candidates will no longer carry commuter, greek or residential designations.
The spring semester marks another round of USG elections. However, this year’s election, which begins on Jan. 28, will feature some notable changes.
“Prior to this election, student government members weren’t able to support or endorse candidates at all,” USG President Rini Sampath said. “This year’s student government members will be speaking out and some might even go as far as to endorse some members publicly.”
Co-Director of Elections and Recruitment Logan Dallas, who penned the revision, said the decision was popular among USG members, many of whom expressed frustration with not being able to voice their support for candidates based on their own experiences serving in student government.
“Typically a lot of people running have experience working in USG and the people they work with know them pretty well and know their qualifications,” Dallas said. “It was pretty well-supported.”
Though individual USG members will be allowed to vocally back candidates, they will still be barred from working on any candidate’s campaign. Additionally, all USG committees and assemblies, such as Program Board or the Political Student Assembly, will not be allowed to formally endorse any ticket or candidate.
With the change in designations, current Residential Sen. Aaron Rifkind said that he is confident the Senate will be able to find a balance in representation without the assigned constituencies.
“I think it’s going to shake itself out and that ultimately there will still be a decent balance among students,” Rifkind said. “It’s the first year we’ve done this, so we’re going to see how it works out.”
According to Dallas, this election season marks an unprecedented number of students who have expressed interest in running in the Senate race, particularly among the freshmen class. Whereas all 12 of last year’s Senate seats were uncontested, each seat is expected to be competitive this year.
Sampath attributed the heightened interest in student government to the popularity of last semester’s campus-wide discussions, ranging from diversity to college affordability.
“I think we had the most engaged semester this campus has seen in terms of student government and the general student body,” Sampath said. “We had the most packed Senate meetings, we had students coming to us with different initiatives and ideas — visibility was so high.”
Last semester, USG partnered with other campus organizations such as the Women’s Student Assembly and the Panhellenic Council to encourage more women to run for office. Though the number of female applicants to run in the upcoming election didn’t see a noticeable change from years past, Sampath said she is hopeful that continued efforts to encourage women to run will inspire growth in future elections.
“There are a lot of empowerment organizations for women — like the greek sororities — but we often don’t see members of these large female groups going for office whereas we may see a lot of members of these large male organizations running for office,” Sampath said. “I’m all for learning and understanding why that is the case and I wonder if we have more conversations within those type of circles maybe we can actually find the answer.”
Sampath said she hopes this election will see more representation among spring admits and transfer students, some of whom she says have reached out to her expressing interest in getting involved with student government.
Popular issues such as college affordability, diversity and mental health were among the many topics to dominate last semester’s campus conversations. Rifkind anticipates that many of these issues will continue to gain traction in the spring.
“The Campus Climate resolution was a step in the right direction, but I think students are still wanting a bit more out of the administration in terms diversity,” Rifkind said. “I still think typical issues like improving campus dining, bike rules on Trousdale and even the smaller things that Senate usually works on alongside bigger issues are still going to remain popular.”
As USG transitions to newly elected leadership later this semester, Sampath encouraged students leaders to serve as advocates for the student body.
“It’s our job to advocate for students and that means taking a stand and having an opinion on things that may not feel like the most popular or likeable idea at the moment,” Sampath said. “The only way we’re going to be able to create change is if we use our voices and the platforms that we have to speak out.”
Voting will take place between Feb. 9 and 11.

It was recently announced that the construction around the outdoor hardscape and landscape project in the Ogasawara Plaza outside of International Residence College will be facing delays.
Though initially the construction was scheduled to be completed by the beginning of the spring semester, there were several delays over winter break.
According to Manny Ocampo, building service supervisor for the area, the delays were primarily due to issues getting city permits.
“[The construction] has been going on for approximately two months,” Ocampo said. “It was scheduled to be completed by the end of break, but unfortunately, the city has lines that we have to go by and permits. It is my understanding that the city is holding us back.”
Ocampo said that city construction permits are done on a rolling basis — while construction might be greenlighted at the start of a project, if a city inspector arrives and disagrees with how the construction is being done, the construction company has to wait for a new green light.
“I am assuming, from previous experiences, [the delay] is because the construction workers do their work according to their own specifications, or the architect’s specifications,” Ocampo said. “But if the city inspector doesn’t agree with it, it doesn’t matter. Everything stops. It may be another couple months before it gets completed.”
Alfonso Casanova, building services manager for those areas said there were additional reasons for the delays.
“There were different things,” Casanova said. “The concrete was thicker than they thought. Shipment of different things didn’t come in on time, we needed certain parts — stuff like that.”
The email sent out by USC Housing cited issues with the “excavation, underground utilities, engineering conflicts and Los Angeles City code interpretations” to be the main causes for the delay but stated that many of the conflicts had been resolved and that construction would continue.
Casanova said he believes the delay in construction will not be an inconvenience to students.
“New bike racks are being put up, so that has been solved,” Casanova said. “I don’t think it’ll be as much of an inconvenience as it was in the starting, when there was a lot of noise and demolition. The demolition part is done and now it’s just a matter of putting everything in.”
Casanova said he believes the construction and whatever inconvenience it may cause is definitely worth it.
“We are building some fireplaces, some space to relax,” Casanova said. “We’re going to have more outdoor furniture and more amenities for the students.”
The projected plans are to expand the seating area in the square and improve the looks of the area by adding a fountain, a furnace with a chimney and possibly some fire pits, according to Ocampo.
Adanna Teemac, a junior majoring in social sciences and a resident assistant in PKS, said she was expecting delays in construction.
“I’m kind of used to delays in construction because USC says they’re going to finish a lot of construction by a certain deadline and then it doesn’t happen,” Teemac said. “So I think I kind of expected it not to be done over break. But it’s not really that big of an inconvenience. I’m excited to see what they do. It might look cool.”
Ocampo hopes that the construction will be completed by the end of the spring semester. In the meantime, those living on the west side of campus should continue parking their bicycles in the racks outside of Parkside.

USC filed a motion in the Los Angeles Superior Court Wednesday opposing claims in the wrongful termination lawsuit that former football head coach Steve Sarkisian is entitled to punitive damages from the University.
Though Sarkisian is seeking $30 million in retribution for the alleged breach of contract and discrimination on the basis of disability, USC has refuted that claim in its formal response.
“It is absolutely false that Sarkisian ever admitted to having a drinking problem, to being an alcoholic or needing to seek treatment,” the University stated.
Sarkisian, whose issues with alcohol started becoming questionable after he appeared visibly intoxicated during a speech at a Salute to Troy alumni banquet, was fired by USC athletic director Pat Haden halfway through the season after a loss to Washington. USC reports state that Sarkisian told Haden that he had only two light beers during the booster event, but that mixing alcohol with a medication he had been taking for anxiety caused him to become unknowingly sedated.
Sarkisian’s civil lawsuit issued on Dec. 7 cited a phone conversation in which the coach admitted to Haden after the Washington loss that he was, “suffering from depression and anxiety” and asked for professional help. The lawsuit further argued that Sarkisian was wrongfully terminated instead of allowing the time off he requested to seek the appropriate treatment.
The recent USC filing identified a clause in Sarkisian’s five-year contract that allowed the school to fire him for reasons that included the use of, “alcohol or any substance which adversely affects Sarkisian’s ability to effectively perform his duties as a head coach.”
Rather than alerting University officials of his suffering with alcoholism, the University said Sarkisian denied that he had a drinking problem, but blamed his inability to perform the essential functions of his job on, “marital stress, lack of sleep and anxiety for which he was taking medication.” The basic responsibilities that USC motion listed as essential to performing his duties as a head coach included showing up for practice and speaking events.
The University response additionally denied that  USC sports psychologist Dr. Robin Scholefield “ever treated, counseled or prescribed medication to Sarkisian as described in his lawsuit.”
Sarkisian’s lawyer, Alan Loewinsohn said in email to ESPN.com:
“Rather than just make broad sweeping conclusions, we filed a very detailed 31-page complaint that sets out much of the factual basis for Coach Sarkisian’s claims. We are anxious to have our day in Court. We remain confident that when the matter is tried the truth of those detailed allegations will be confirmed.”

College is a time to explore many things: identity, clubs and organizations, different philosophies or Los Angeles. Though USC is a great place to explore these things, it’s also a great place to explore something even more important, especially to college students: coffee. Every student has his or her favorite coffee stop, and many are found around campus.
Ground Zero Performance Café
This student-run coffee shop, located behind Marks Tower and Trojan Hall, is a campus favorite. Ground Zero Performance Café is everything people would want their college coffee shop to be, with open mic nights, slam poetry, band nights and comedy by night. It’s also a great place to relax or study by day. In addition, Ground Zero has a unique menu, the most popular items being the milkshakes, which feature many awesome combinations, including the Funfetti Cake Shake, which actually tastes just like Funfetti cake mix, Everything But the Girl Scout, which tastes like Thin Mints, and the very popular Five-Dollar Shake, which is a mix of peanut butter cups and oreos. The shakes are a must, but Ground Zero also has a variety of hot and cold beverages that’ll keep anyone wired, like the All-Nighter, which features two shots of espresso, chai, vanilla and steamed milk. Plus, it has the cheapest coffee on campus at $1.50 for hot or iced, but pro-tip: bring a reusable cup, and the cup of coffee is only $1.25.
The Café at Annenberg
The newest coffee shop on campus, The Café provides a unique experience reminiscent of a European coffee shop. Featuring the fresh grounds of illy beans, along with macarons, pastries and gelato, The Cafe has a fresh menu full of different espresso drinks that can’t be found anywhere else on campus. It also boasts of a killer menu of sandwiches, soups and salads, like the roasted chicken salad that will always be better than a Seeds salad, or the three cheese panini. Since The Cafe is fairly new, the line is never too long, so it’s definitely a great choice.
Literatea
For those that are not into coffee, don’t panic. Literatea, located behind Doheny Library, while still serving coffee, has a stellar menu of fine teas, from black to green and herbal to oolong. It also offers delicious iced tea lemonade drinks, as well as tea lattes, and other snacks and pastries. It has a cozy aesthetic that’s perfect for curling up with a book and studying, and it also has pots of tea available to share with friends either inside or outside in the courtyard, which may or may not feel like Hogwarts.
Nature’s Brew
While technically not on the USC campus, Nature’s Brew makes this list because USC students are always around. The small cafe, located on Union Avenue off of Hoover, is a great spot for well-made coffee and pastries. Everything is made fresh, from the juices and smoothies to the tasty vegan cookies, and the sandwiches and salads are always delicious. On occasion there’s live music or even comedy, usually put on by USC students, which never disappoint.
Nékter at Shop Café
Nestled in Roski, Nékter offers something that no other coffee shop on campus does: In addition to menu items such as smoothies, juice and cold brew coffee and a variety of other coffee drinks, makes Nékter an excellent stop with a fruity twist. It also offers some scrumptious pastries. However, if you’re stopping by and ordering an açaí bowl or smoothie, be sure to have a lot of time to kill or order ahead with Tapingo. Otherwise, the line might take up to 20 minutes.
Law School Cafe
Hidden in the basement of the law school, the Law School Cafe is a gem. With a full menu of food and drinks, it’s the only place on campus to serve boba with milk tea or thai tea. It also has an awesome menu of salads, sandwiches and rice bowls — a delicious salmon and avocado rice bowl only costs $8, which beats Campus Center any day. That and the fact that there’s cozy indoor and outdoor seating, makes this place one to visit. Plus, there’s never a line.
Love you a latte · Coffee Bean has three places on campus: the School of Cinematic Arts, the Campus Center and the old Annenberg building.
The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf
Be warned, the Coffee Bean can be a hit or miss place on campus. During busy hours, the drinks can sometimes be subpar, but when there’s no line and the time is put into the drinks, they usually get it right. Coffee Bean has three different locations on campus: one in the School of Cinematic Arts, one in Campus Center, as well as a cart in the old Annenberg building. The SCA Coffee Bean is definitely the top location, with beautiful outdoor seating in the SCA courtyard, providing a great view of the fountain and amazing architecture.
Tutor Hall Cafe
Tutor Hall Cafe, at Ronald Tutor Hall in Viterbi, has an excellent variety of food, from Indian cuisine to a banh mi sandwich. It’s an awesome place to grab some ramen or a sandwich with friends, as there’s indoor and outdoor seating and also a coffee bar with a variety of drinks. However, the coffee drinks here are pretty standard, with normal lattes, iced coffees and teas. Though not the best place for those who desire a specialty latte, it’s still a great environment.
Popovich Cafe
Popovich Cafe is a cozy shop inside Popovich Hall near the business school. Grab a great panini, salad, soup or even some Jamba Juice, and then order a nice cup of joe. Similar to Tutor Hall Cafe, the coffee drinks here are also pretty standard, so don’t expect an extensive menu.
Trojan Grounds
While Trojan Grounds aka the Starbucks aka Trogro, conveniently located next to Leavey Library and many of the freshman dorms, can be filled with memories of late night coffee runs, there is always a line out the door. Sorry, but Tapingo won’t help here since sometimes that has a 20 minute wait if not more. The best times to go are before 8 a.m. and after 6 p.m. to grab wide varieties of snacks, sandwiches and coffee … Even at 3 a.m.

It’s a new year and a new semester — people are looking to start fresh, with many vowing to get fit as their New Year’s resolutions. For some, working out can be a major struggle. And it’s not necessarily the physical aspects of working out that many find to be tough — it is finding the motivation to do it.
Fitness classes are a great way to maintain the enthusiasm for a healthy New Year’s resolution. In a fitness class, people can get in shape by learning from a well-trained instructor in a setting that allows them to feed off the energy of other people. Though the classes may seem intimidating at first, instructors usually make an effort to make new participants feel comfortable and remind them that they can go at their own pace.
One of the most popular workout hotspots at the moment is SoulCycle, a spinning class with locations throughout L.A. and the United States. The company’s website states that the goal of a SoulCycle class is to “guide riders through an inspirational, meditative fitness experience that’s designed to benefit the body, mind, and soul.” Though the spiritual aspect may scare some people away from the class, it is an experience worth trying.
Each class space is filled with bikes that face an instructor — instructors choose the music played during their classes, which may seem like just a way to add some excitement to the workout, but can set the entire tone of the class. In addition, well-chosen music is a great tool to motivate riders and keep them going through the hardest parts of the ride. Each instructor’s SoundCloud can be viewed through the SoulCycle app and website to ensure that each rider can pick an instructor with similar music tastes.
If working out in front of other people seems daunting, don’t fret; SoulCycle is held in a candle-lit room, which forces people to focus on their own workouts rather than their neighboring cyclists. The ambient lighting also adds to the spiritual aspect of the class, as the atmosphere is intended to give people a chance to find their “soul.”
A SoulCycle will be opening on Olive and 9th in Downtown L.A., about a 10-minute drive from USC, in 2016. At $30 a class, SoulCycle is definitely one of the more expensive workout classes out there. However, there are many other classes near campus that provide a great workout for less.
Boxing is also a great way to get a good sweat going and relieve some stress. Boxing classes are designed to work your whole body and are a great way to get toned and strengthen your core. City of Angels Boxing is just a three-minute drive or 15-minute walk from campus. Each class costs $20, or $99 for an unlimited month of classes. Considering how expensive gyms and other workout classes cost in Downtown, the cost of these classes are definitely a steal.
If you’re not sure what kind of workout class is best for you, try some out at USC: The Lyon Center on campus offers some great classes at a lower cost. The first week of classes, January 11-15, is a “Preview Week” for all workout classes and are free for students. Passes are available for purchase on a semester basis, which allows students to go to as many — or as little — classes as they choose. This is a great option for students living on or near campus who do not want to commute to other workout classes in a further location.
Make 2016 the year you follow through with your yearly resolutions — ­try some classes and find one that best suits your personality.

Los Angeles contains a plethora of cultural activities and events, with a majority of them occurring just a few Metro stops away from USC in the heart of downtown L.A. And within the core of L.A.’s cultural scene is an infinite realm of classical music, a world that is often masked by the harrowing glitz and glam of Hollywood.
Indeed, the gem that is L.A.’s classical music scene is one that is often disregarded by most Angelenos. And those who are aware seldom seem to take advantage of the thrill that these performances offer. Furthermore, fewer people, particularly students, seem to know about the Student Rush tickets that are almost always available for each performance. Student Rush tickets, which can only be purchased the day of the performance, fit within the frame of a student budget, and often cost $25 or less.
However, it would be foolish to assume that cheap tickets would suddenly boost the popularity of classical music to infinite proportions. However, for those interested in experiencing something new and exhilarating, here is a list of five essential classical music events occurring in L.A. during the winter months:
Nothing but treble · The Walt Disney Concert Hall, located at the heart of downtown Los Angeles, is home to the L.A. Philharmonic. Programs there feature classical, contemporary and world music.
Itzhak Perlman at Walt Disney Concert Hall
 
This event is perhaps the most obvious to include; virtuoso Itzhak Perlman, arguably the most accomplished violinist alive, performs with and conducts the Los Angeles Philharmonic in a program ranging from Mozart to Tchaikovsky. To non-classical music-goers, it should be noted that Perlman is to the violin as Madonna is to pop music; in other words, only a seasoned vet like Perlman could occupy four consecutive nights in a single performance space and live to tell the tale. The performances take place from Jan. 14-17 at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
 
Thomas Morse/Ken Cazan’s Frau Schindler at Newman Recital Hall, USC
 
In early February, USC Thornton Opera will present a concert reading of Morse/Cazan’s new opera Frau Schindler, with a majority of the roles being sung by students within the Thornton School of Music’s Vocal Arts Program. Cazan, who is resident stage director of USC Thornton Opera, adds “librettist” to his long list of accomplishments with this new work that centers on the ethics and morals challenged by Oskar Schindler’s wife, Emilie. The opera, which seems to contain many feminist undertones, explores similar themes brought up in Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-winning film Schindler’s List, though from a female’s perspective.
What is most striking about this performance, regardless of its content and music, its accessibility: it’s both on campus and free of charge. The concert performance will be held Feb. 5 at 8 p.m. in Newman Recital Hall, with a pre-performance discussion with both Morse and Cazan at 7 p.m. Tickets can be reserved through Visions and Voices.
 
Mozart’s The Magic Flute at L.A. Opera
 
This English language adaptation of the Mozart staple returns to L.A. Opera after a wildly successful run in its 2013-14 season. The glamorous production, conceived by Barrie Kosky and London-based performance company 1927, incorporates 1920s aesthetics with film noir-like visual projections that replaces a physical set. The cast includes many young and up-and-coming opera singers, many of whom are participants in L.A. Opera’s Domingo-Colburn-Stein Young Artist Program. The production will be conducted by L.A. Opera Music Director James Conlon and runs Feb. 13-March 6 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
 
Debussy’s Pelléas et Mélisande at Walt Disney Concert Hall
 
I am such a schmuck for Claude Debussy; the asymmetry and pathos of his harmonics are enough to make my toes curl. Though Debussy is infrequently known for his operas, his Pelléas et Mélisande remains an acclaimed jewel of 20th-century opera. Under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen, the L.A. Phil collaborates with internationally-acclaimed singers in performances of this seldom-performed piece. Performances will take place on Feb. 19 and 21 at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
 
Mahler’s Symphony No. 3 at Walt Disney Concert Hall
 
The phrase “last but not least” was perhaps coined for performances such as this one; closing out the list, and the winter season in general, is Gustav Mahler’s “Symphony No. 3”, conducted by the famed Gustavo Dudamel. Dudamel, who also serves as music director for L.A. Phil, leads the orchestra in what should be a thrilling collaborative endeavor of one of Mahler’s largest symphonies. Joined by mezzo-soprano Tamara Mumford, female singers of the Los Angeles Master Chorale, and the Los Angeles Children’s Chorus, this performance is almost a salute for the female voice. Performances will occur Mar. 3-6 at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
More information regarding performances at Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and the Thornton School of Music can be found online.

Brunch, especially on Sundays, has and continues to be a major staple in Los Angeles culture. There is no better way to decompress after a long week of school than heading out to a modern bistro in L.A. for brunch. Combining breakfast staples like eggs and sweets with the savory dishes of lunch, brunch is nothing short of perfection.
Faith & Flower
This beautifully contemporary restaurant is perfect for a morning adventure into downtown L.A. Located in the WaterMarke Tower in DTLA’s South Park district, Faith & Flower has amazing arugula and chicory salads and deviled eggs made with kimchi and Korean chili, available which are an excellent way to start the day.  For heavier fare, try their sole or hen breast. This restaurant focuses on the juxtaposition between modern day and the roaring ’20s with their decorations and ingredients. Their new and unique flavors give the classic menu items a modern flair. The cocktail menu celebrates the drinking culture of the ’20s and pairs perfectly with the inventive cuisine of executive chef Michael Hung. Massive chandeliers, mirrors and antique silverware make for an excellent dining experience.
LA Chapter
With the classic black and white tiled floor and quaint wooden tables, this spot is perfect for a brunch Instagram. Located in the Ace Hotel in DTLA, this restaurant features locally-sourced produce and uses European inspirations to create an innovative menu. The menu has odd ingredient pairings, such as duck and hazelnut and a burger with pineapple and an egg on top, that are truly amazing and thoughtful, and not to mention delicious. It has an all-day menu with items like the avocado toast, ricotta pancakes and a Moroccan scramble made with sausage, avocado, cilantro and chickpeas served on a flatbread. This restaurant is perfectly designed for brunching with friends.
Gracias Madre
This vegan restaurant has various Mexican and local influences. Head chef Chandra Gilbert uses all locally-grown, organic ingredients. The restaurant itself is absolutely adorable and has an outdoor patio with beautiful greenery, modern seating and a fireplace — an elegant rarity in L.A. and a great photo op. The brunch menu features many refreshing morning cocktails and smoothies along with a tofu scramble, plantain French toast and a breakfast torta. This vegan Mexican restaurant is extremely popular, and rightfully so. Cooking Mexican food with plant-based ingredients is extremely hard, but Gracias Madre has excelled at it.
Republique
The building was built in 1928 by the late Charlie Chaplin and architect, Roy Sheldon Price, and is surrounded by a tiled courtyard. With classic ironwork, beautiful stonework and an open concept, this place is perfect for brunch. The modern French cuisine and large communal tables are great for brunching with friends. Brunch is available Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Their fresh lemonade and morning cocktails are perfect pairings with features like Ricotta toast, Belgian waffles and shakshouka, a dish of eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, chili peppers and onions, often spiced with cumin. After brunch, stop by the bakery and bring some treats back home.
Terrine
This spectacular restaurant plates their dishes so thoughtfully, even just a photo will make all Instagram followers jealous. Their brunch menu features both savory and sweet options. Some highlights are the Croque-Madame — toasted ham and cheese sandwich topped with a fried egg, foie gras — fattened liver of duck or goose, and the Terrine Benedict — crispy veal tongue, chive hollandaise, spinach and a housemade english muffin. The head chef, Kris Morningstar, has won the GQ Magazine Dish of the Year award. He creates innovative French dishes in an absolutely beautiful setting. The dining room is decorated with stunning antique appointments and is complemented by the lovely patio that surrounds an old tree.
While these five brunch finds are unbelievably extraordinary, there are endless possibilities in L.A. This list is only a very small sampling of the hundreds of delicious places in Los Angeles to enjoy brunch. With so many different cuisines, there is a place to satisfy any want from vegan joints to the best bottomless boozy brunch. Post-brunch naps are seriously recommended.

Food trends fade in and out of mainstream culture faster than anyone can yell “Fight On!” A recent trend that’s managed to stick though is juice. And that doesn’t mean Welch’s Grape Juice. Juicing has become a popular way to cleanse, detox and hit the reset button. Packed with nutrients, cold pressed juice is one of the tastiest and most nourishing ways to satisfy your cravings while flushing the toxins out of your system.
Though this new health trend might fill you with every vitamin and antioxidant known to man, it also might drain you of every last penny. There’s an easy fix to that though: make it at home! At-home juicing gives students like ourselves, a cheaper and more personalized way to “have your juice and drink it too!”
There are two types of juices: fruit juices — which incorporate mostly fruits and come in plentiful colors — and green juices, which are made up of a variety of fruits and vegetables. A scrumptious vegetable juice may sound unlikely, but don’t knock it until you try it. The combination of fruits and vegetables allows for a wholesome, nutritious addition to your usual diet.
The easiest way to make juice at home is with a blender. You put in all the ingredients and blend it on the highest level setting, such as puree or liquefy. From there you have two options: either drink it thick with all the pulp as a smoothie, or pour it through a mesh sieve to get only the juice. The following recipes are adapted from Martha Stewart Living.
Green Juices
A lot of green juices incorporate kale because of its many nutrients, such as vitamins B6, K, A and C. It has health benefits ranging from cardiovascular support to immune boosting. If not kale, spinach, celery stalks or chard can also be used for a filling result.

Green Citrus

Beet Apple Chard
– 1 beet

– 1 cucumber
– 3 swiss chard leaves
– 10 parsley sprigs
Kale Kiwi Strawberry
– 1 bunch of kale
– 3 kiwis
– 2 cups of strawberries
– 1 inch of ginger
– ½ banana
Fruit Juices
Fruit juices are a very popular type of juice. They’re filled with antioxidants and a variety of vitamins to help keep the body nourished. These juices can help with strengthening the immune system and boosting metabolism.
Apple Ginger
– 3 Fuji apples
– 1 peeled lemon
– 1 inch peeled ginger
– ½ banana
Lemon-Lime Ginger Ale
– 1 fuji apple
– ½ inch ginger
– handful of grapes
– ½ lemon
– ½ lime
– add sparkling mineral water as fit
Twisted Apple Juice
– 2 peaches
– 1 pear
– 2 apples
– Handful of strawberries
Fruit Punch
– 1 apple
– 8 strawberries
– 1 orange, peeled
– ½ cup of raspberries
– ½ banana
Juicing is a colorful and healthy trend that continues to be on the rise. College students usually try to save as much as possible, which is why juicing at home can be so great. But for those days that you just need a no-fuss, no-mess treat, a juice bar is another great option. These fun joints can be found all over Los Angeles, whether it’s in Downtown at Juice Crafters, or on camps grabbing a quick drink at Nékter. The convenience and cleansing aspects of juicing make it an ideal break from the usual diet of a college student.
