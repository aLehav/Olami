Following a slew of coaching changes by Clay Helton, Athletic Director Lynn Swann spoke in support of the head coach on Tuesday.
In a segment on Trojans Live, Swann defended Helton, who fired offensive line coach Neil Callaway and announced he would take over of play-calling duties from offensive coordinator Tee Martin on Monday.
“I believe in [Helton],” Swann said. “I like the position that he takes. [Helton] is passionate about what he does. He is honest and real in what he wants to accomplish and how he wants to accomplish [it]. There is no false chatter in [Helton].”
After Saturday’s loss to Arizona State dropped USC to 4-4, Helton and Swann made the changes in hopes of salvaging a disappointing season. 
“[Helton] and I talked about this,” Swann said. “He told me the changes he wanted to make. I agreed with the changes he wanted to make, and we go from there.”
In a Pac-12 coaches call earlier on Tuesday, Helton talked about his decisions, which came less than 24 hours after he stated that no major changes will be made until after the season.
“I’ve had an itch to get more integrated with the offense,” Helton said. “Being in year three [as] head coach, I feel much more comfortable in the role. I know the lay of the land now, and have wanted to get more involved to help the offense continue to grow. I felt like it was the right time.”
Helton gave no indication that Martin is on the hot seat as well.
“[Martin] and I have had conversations about this decision and he was supportive,” Helton said. “He has done a tremendous job here. He will stay involved with the offense as he remains the offensive coordinator. [He will] help put together our practice and game plans and serve as my offensive eyes during games.”
When asked if he felt pressure to make the changes due to the Trojans’ .500 record, Helton tersely replied, “None.”
Swann defended his support of Helton and the decisions he made. 
“I stand solidly behind Clay to move those things forward,” Swann said. “My responsibility is to the entire athletic program. My responsibility is to try and help [Helton] be the best head coach and manager of people we can be. That’s why we talk consistently, honestly, openly. We communicate in terms of what’s going on.”
Swann continued to praise the progress Helton has made with the program, noting the state of the team when he took over. 
“Go back a couple years ago, we were 1-3, didn’t look good against Alabama,” Swann said. “We bounced back and won nine straight games.”
He stressed the inevitable learning curve that comes with hiring a new head coach. It takes them a while to build their program and figure out the best strategy to implement with the right personnel. Swann backed Helton on the positives that he brings to the program. 
“If you’re talking about evaluating a coach, look at the fact that you start off poorly and you maintain control of the team,” Swann said. “And players play for you. This team put their back up against the wall and came up fighting. [Helton] has the ability to lead this team. They believe in [him].”
Martin seemed upbeat while speaking to reporters after Tuesday’s practice, even after being stripped of his primary duties. He and Helton  previously discussed the matter in private. 
“I told [Helton], ‘You being the head coach, you have every right to do that. Go ahead,’” Martin said. “We discussed it, and moved on.”
However, Martin did not deny the fact that he is disappointed, but remained focused on the team first.
“As a competitor, you’ve been doing a job and feel like you’ve been doing a good job at what you’ve been doing, and having it taken away is tough,” Martin said. “I’m here for the team and ultimately to support my head coach.” 
Martin was also asked about his cryptic removal of all USC-related information from his Twitter page. 
“Just changing my picture, you know, wanting to post about my family,” Martin said with a smile. 
Amid the changes, Swann commented on the players’ need for support in such a crucial time.
“The coaches call plays, but it’s the players that have to execute,” Swann said. “We need the Trojan Family to stand behind this team.”

Junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier posted 18 kills Saturday in USC’s Cal victory over Cal. (Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan)
After a three-set loss to No. 2 Stanford Friday, the women’s volleyball team returned to Galen Center Sunday to edge out Cal in a four-set thriller (35-33, 25-20, 18-25, 25-14).
The first set against Cal was a battle, setting the tone for the rest of the game. 
The two teams exchanged points for the majority of the match, with neither team pulling far enough ahead. The first set was tied 24 different times, but a Trojan ace from senior libero Victoria Garrick after a kill by junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier brought the set to an end at 35-33.
“A lot of the time when we’re up in games, teams usually come back,” Lanier said after the match. “The first set was kind of a testament to that, but I’m happy that we did pull it out and stick in there.”
Head coach Brent Crouch commended his team for siding well during the first set.  
“Then we were competing with [Cal] well, and that’s the part that stayed the same with the exception of the beginning,” Crouch said.
The second set started out similarly, but would end much sooner than the last.
When USC was only holding a 1-point lead at 15-14, the Golden Bears committed three errors in a row to give the Trojans the advantage they needed to finish the set 25-20.
Crouch attributed the Trojans’ second set success to a Cal coaching mistake.
“Their best server is [sophomore setter Isabel Potter] and she usually starts the game serving,” Crouch said. “They had her serve last in the rotation in the second set. They usually score points when she’s serving, so we just were able to get a lead and maintain it.”
 While Cal seemed to lose steam at the end of the second set, the team came out of the locker room with new energy that translated into a 7-0 run.
The Trojans played from behind the entire set. Ultimately, the Bears finished the set at 25-18 and forced the Trojans to play another set. 
“The energy tonight was really good,” Lanier said. “We really did work on announcing ourselves, which was [Crouch]’s phrase this week. I think we did a good job with … establishing a team chemistry out of the gate.”
Despite losing to Stanford on Friday, the Women of Troy finished out the weekend strong. 
The team looks to improve its 8-4 conference record on the road against No. 16 Oregon on Friday and Oregon State Sunday.

Since the moment he was officially announced as USC football’s 25th head coach in November 2015, Clay Helton has dealt with a seemingly endless flood of doubt, criticism and direct calls for his termination. 
Sure, anyone who takes a major head coaching job in college or professional sports is disposed to scrutiny, but few have felt the burns from being under the magnifying glass of public opinion quite like Helton.
Time and time again, Helton has found some way to settle down a fanbase and city that demand nothing short of champions — leading the Trojans to a Pac-12 championship appearance as, basically, an interim coach in 2015. 
Helton somehow galvanized a depressing 1-3 team into a squad that finished 10-3 with a Rose Bowl victory and held the No. 3 spot in the final AP poll of 2016; and nearly running the table in conference along with dramatic victories over Texas and Stanford en route to a Pac-12 championship and New Year’s Six bowl appearance. 
Add in a spectacular recruiting record with classes that have remained ranked in the top 10 each of the past four years. And like him or not, Helton’s track record made him the best head coach in the Pac-12 heading into 2018.
Over the matter of a few months, the perception around Helton and beleaguered assistant offensive coordinator Tee Martin is that it is not a matter of if they will be fired, but when. While Helton’s decision Monday to move on from offensive line coach Neil Callaway and take play calling responsibilities away from Martin is a start, this may not be enough to an impatient USC faithful. They will need to see results or heads will continue to roll.
The massive 19-game home winning streak USC held that only trailed Alabama in length has now been broken. The team’s 4-4 record overall including a 2-2 mark in the Pac-12 South — a division in the running for the most disappointing (if not outright worst) collection of teams in college football — is well beneath the lofty expectations of a Trojan side that came into the season ranked 15th in the nation. 
In the handful of games that USC has enjoyed something close to a large national audience (visiting Stanford on Fox primetime, visiting Texas on Fox primetime, hosting Arizona State on ABC) USC has lost in often-embarrassing fashion.
Above all, a new and surprisingly more worrisome issue has popped up for USC football: fans have stopped showing up. 
Without taking credit away from the team for its 19-game win streak at home, it’s fair to say that USC fans have historically created a difficult environment for visiting teams. 
One of the largest stadiums in college football — at least before renovations began — the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum can get as loud as any field in America. Watch highlights from games against teams like Texas and Stanford in 2017, if not from the glory days in the early 2000s and this becomes extremely obvious: Teams just don’t win in L.A.
This is true unless those fans decide not to show up to the games. For Saturday’s 12:30 p.m. kickoff against Arizona State, USC reported an attendance of 47,406, which may be good among Pac-12 teams this weekend, but the 60 percent capacity of the stadium represents the second lowest among Pac-12 teams. 
With the exception of an abysmal 46 percent capacity in the Rose Bowl for the UCLA–Utah contest — a Friday night game that directly conflicted with the World Series — USC managed to produce the lowest home field advantage of any team in the conference.
While numbers have been in decline for the Trojans all season due to ongoing stadium renovations, the departure of Sam Darnold and a lack of quality visiting teams, Saturday’s display revealed a depressing truth: The fans no longer have the same faith and vigor in USC’s football program.
It is not the same excitement that surrounded the team in the early 2000s. It is not the same feeling of hope that Trojan fans had in the lead up and during the Rose Bowl in 2016. It doesn’t even match where the program was after devastating losses to Washington State and Notre Dame in 2017. As it stands now, much of USC’s fanbase has been turned off by the product they see on the field. 
Subsequently, some major recruits have cooled on the idea of being a Trojan as well. Over the course of a few weeks, USC has lost commitments from St. John Bosco standouts Chris Steele and Kris Hutson. USC currently has the 27th-ranked recruiting class in the nation, behind schools such as Purdue, Virginia, North Carolina State and Arkansas.
Now, the question is what Athletic Director Lynn Swann will do to steer USC football back on the right path. The decisions he will have to make over the coming months will undoubtedly come to define his tenure as the head of USC Athletics.
For the most part, fans have already made up their minds. Until they see real change, likely to the coaching staff, they will gladly watch games from their homes and opt to spend time and money on the many other things L.A. has to offer.
What decision will Swann arrive at? The fate of the program hangs in the balance.

On Sunday, Hasan Minhaj became the first Indian-American to host a late night talk show. The first two episodes covered sensitive topics like affirmative action and Saudi Arabia. (Photo from Rotten Tomatoes)
Past its initial awkwardness, “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,” a new 32-episode variety show from Netflix, proved to be both timely and informative in the contemporary political landscape. 
Netflix debuted the show’s first two episodes, “Affirmative Action” and “Saudi Arabia,” on Sunday and the remaining episodes will air in subsequent weeks.
Comedian and former “The Daily Show” correspondent Hasan Minhaj not only stars in “Patriot Act,” but also serves as its showrunner. In his attempt to do it all, Minhaj successfully produces striking content, yet falls short when it comes to his on-stage delivery. His appearance — from his perfectly groomed beard to his carelessly stylish outfit — in the pilot episode was too rehearsed and meticulously fabricated to feel organic. 
Minhaj’s stage presence seemed stiff and unnatural as well. Standing in the middle of a enormous stage, Minhaj used overly flamboyant hand gestures that didn’t match the topics the show centered on. 
Even his walking and positioning was rigid, as viewers could see exactly where he rehearsed to stop and speak.
However, Minhaj’s delivery was strong from the get-go, as he recited specific facts about affirmative action in a way that assumed his audience already knew the basics. He stared deeply into the camera, imploring audiences to buy into what he was saying.
After overcoming Minhaj’s learning curve of hosting a show for the first time, the pertinent content featured in the first episode became digestible. Minhaj used a recognizable format, a comedic segment with video interludes, à la “Last  Week Tonight with John Oliver,” to explain essential information.
In addition, “Affirmative Action” offered a deep dive into Supreme Court case on Harvard’s affirmative action policies.
While Minhaj skimped on reporting the bare essentials of affirmative action, he did highlight Edward Blum, conservative legal activist and founder of the case’s plaintiff, Students for Fair Admissions. Using self-deprecating humor — like getting rejected from Stanford not because of race but because of his 1310 SAT score, Minhaj cleverly explained the gist of the pivotal case. 
At times, Minhaj’s analogies fell flat — for example, comparing plaintiffs parties to The Hulk — but the former “Daily Show” correspondent got his point across in the show: Banning affirmative action would not just get rid of racial quotas, but it would also take away the holistic approach to college admissions that allows for rich, yet fair, diversity on campuses across the country.
Minhaj achieved what he set out to do — get audiences to think beyond the surface of topical political issues. He asked pertinent questions about race and identity with relation to education in the United States and sparked an important conversation about standards used for college admissions. 
In “Patriot Act,” Minhaj has taken a step toward balancing his comedic endeavors with political ambitions. But only time and future episodes will reveal if he can learn to loosen up. For now, though, “Patriot Act” is a place to learn about highly relevant political and cultural topics — that is, if the viewer doesn’t mind occasionally looking away due to the Minhaj’s awkwardness.

Jan. 17, 2017 will forever be remembered as the day Vine was put to rest. 
But since then, Vine’s post-death popularity has increased beyond when the platform was alive, solidifying Vine as a comedic force that has shaped internet culture.
Known for its six-second nonsensical videos, Vine was a looping video sharing app that launched in 2013. At its most basic function, the app allowed creators to film, edit and publish videos. 
Additionally, users could “revine” videos posted by accounts they followed — essentially a combination of Instagram and Twitter with a focus on short-form video. 
Vine quickly became wildly popular between 2013 and 2015, with some predicting that longer-form content found on YouTube would die out and be replaced by Vine. This trend, however, tapered off as Vine creators increasingly switched to YouTube and fewer users engaged on the platform. 
Though Twitter acquired Vine in 2012 for $30 million, it announced only four years later that it would discontinue the app but still keep the Vine camera available.
Creators and users alike mourned on Twitter about the death of their beloved app, with many hoping that the community outcry would keep Vine alive.  Twitter was subsequently filled with users re-sharing Vines and forming Twitter threads of old Vines. 
On YouTube, uploaded Vine compilations, which are usually upward of 10 minutes in length, easily gained hundreds of thousands or millions of views. Even after the app officially shut down, tweets about its videos  and compilations still garnered more popularity. 
As Vine reaches its two-year death anniversary, its viral videos remain a part of cultural conversations. 
The archived platform remains as relevant as ever.
Truth be told, I barely remember using Vine during its prime. I was just a freshman in high school, and I only checked the app as a last-resort entertainment option (I did, however, spend a hefty amount of time on YouTube). 
I only really invested time into it as a college freshman, when I would stay up late at night cry-laughing to Vine compilations with my roommates. 
The “USC Memes for Spoiled Pre-Teens” Facebook group also makes use of anachronistic vines, with my personal favorite complication being “USC frats as Vines.” Heck, even the nametags on the doors of my residential hall are themed with Vine references. 
Today, almost two years after its passing, I frequently engage in Vine culture, which is bizarre considering that the app no longer provides fresh content.
But, if Vine is dead, why does it still play such a prominent role in young people’s lives?
While routinely perusing YouTube, I came across the video “How Vine Shaped a Generation” by Tiffany Ferguson, one of my favorite influencers. 
A well established content creator who’s been around since 2012 and gone viral, Ferguson has actively partaken in the rise and fall of many internet trends, including Vine. In this video, which is a part of her “Internet Analysis” series, Ferguson deconstructs Vine’s lasting influence on the internet generation nearly two years after the video app’s shutdown.
“The thing about a good Vine is usually that it worked indescribably well,” Ferguson said. “You could never really explain why it’s funny, exactly what the joke is, and that’s kind of what makes Vine feel like a breeding ground for inside jokes for this generation.”
She goes on to discuss how certain common elements found in Vines — quick-witted punchlines, sudden loud noises, contorted facial expressions, self-deprecating humor — have spread to longer-form content. Ferguson describes this style of content as “Over-the-top humor, a little bit of depression [and] a side of silliness.” 
Especially as so many ex-Viners like David Dobrik, Liza Koshy, Cody Ko and the Paul brothers (dare I mention them?) have gained massive popularity on YouTube, their successful bit-style videos have given rise to new-age creators like Emma Chamberlain, who has gained popularity by adopting similar content formats. 
Viners were once the butt of the joke, as Ferguson put it, but the platform’s wide-reaching prominence has allowed it to climb to the top posthumously.
Beyond the way it has reshaped content structures on YouTube and Twitter, Vine remains popular because of its nostalgic appeal. 
Vine is a cheerful past that was shared by young people, and the simplicity of the app makes reveling in its legacy all the easier. 
Further, the app was released at a pivotal moment in the digital age, when social media was transitioning from misunderstood to legitimate, solidifying Vine as a defining component of internet culture as we know it today.
Vine may be dead, but it lives on with users who enjoy the ridiculous six-second videos and the community that surrounded them. Whether we’ll still be quoting Vines 20 years down the road is hard to say, but Vine has definitely earned its place in digital history — that’s for sure.

On Saturday night, Josh Groban played at The Forum as part of his “Bridges” tour. 
Groban, a Los Angeles native, entranced the audience with his impeccable vocals and took them through a journey of love and hope.
Special guest Idina Menzel dazzled in a silver-sequined jumpsuit that caught the light with each step. She performed a set that mixed original discography with songs from projects she’s performed. 
Her singalong moments came during selections from “Frozen,” when she turned the microphone toward the audience for backing vocals. 
Despite the warm reception, performances of “Do You Want to Build a Snowman” and “Let it Go” were awkward at best and pandering at worst. 
She crouched on the floor during her cover of “I’ll Stop the World.” Repeating the chorus, she connected the individual listeners and personalized the song. Menzel also showed off her range with an arrangement that allowed her voice to fill out the venue.
From starry-eyed “The Wizard and I”  to soaring “Defying Gravity,” Menzel commanded the stage with the presence and poise of the veteran performer that she is.
For his set, Groban strode on stage dressed casually in an unzipped blue bomber jacket.
Between songs, he delivered unscripted anecdotes to the audience, often changing direction and tone depending on what came to mind — often peppered with bad puns and dad jokes. At one point, he referred to audience members as “nuggets of specialness.” With each display of cheesy gratitude, Groban’s charm shone through.
When he started to sing, a switch flipped. The geeky and sometimes awkward man transformed into a musical virtuoso with arguably one of the best voices in contemporary music. 
Groban didn’t need gimmicks, an elaborate stage design or dancers to captivate the audience. He only needed his never-faltering voice. 
Groban offered sweeping vocals right from his opening song, “Bigger Than Us.” His face twisted with desperation, as if on the edge of the world onstage at The Forum. With an outstretched arm, he implored the audience to save him from whatever sorrow inspired the song.
Groban dedicated a portion of his set to covers from various musicals, as the stage bathed in purple for “Pure Imagination” from “Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory.” The live band pulled back as Groban’s voice transported the audience away from their seats to a magical place.  
The band jammed to an instrumental number, giving Groban time to run over to the side stage, where he continued his series of covers on a piano. 
“She’s Always a Woman” united Billy Joel’s timeless lyrics with Groban’s sincere delivery. The subtle instrumentation made the song one of the most romantic and raw performances of the evening.
For “Lullaby,” he brought out Menzel for a duet. The two powerful voices didn’t mesh as expected.
Another standout was “Bring Him Home” from “Les Misérables.” Groban reached up into his rare falsetto, and perfectly encapsulated the song’s themes of danger and paternal love.
During “You Raise Me Up,” Groban demonstrated his talent in a powerful crescendo leading up to the song’s climax. At the key change, a choir joined him on stage and, paired with Groban’s soaring vocals, created a near-religious experience. 
To close the evening, Groban performed a cover of “Bridge Over Troubled Water.” The haunting song served as a final plea to his audience to choose love over anger. As Groban belted out the final notes with bravado, many of his suspended listeners took his message to heart.

As Martin Luther King once said, “What good is having the right to sit at a lunch counter if you can’t afford to buy a hamburger?”
This is a wise question that asks more of people who want social inequality without sacrificing much in terms of economic equality. 
Next time someone says that they’re “fiscally conservative, socially liberal,” let them know that it is not a viable ideology. People who prescribe to that ideal are ignoring the stronghold that economic policies have on social justice. 
Most people who hold these beliefs tend to forget there’s more to social policies than the typical topic of same-sex marriage, abortion and identity politics. 
Every social issue — including feminism, same-sex marriage and race politics — contains fiscal elements and are therefore also economic issues. Thus, it is critical for people who want equality in this country to vote liberally, both fiscally and socially. 
The impact economics have had on so-called “social” issues is undeniable. According to Scholars Strategy Network, certain policies have historically helped minorities make gains, such as President Bill Clinton’s expansion of the earned income tax credit, which gives low income working people a tax refund check.
Other liberal policies, such as the Civil Rights Act and the War on Poverty, have boosted the incomes of unprivileged Americans. 
Deregulation of the private sector  allows for violations of worker rights, and also traps Americans in a cycle of chronic poverty by perpetuating a cycle of mistreatment and abuse by employers. The preeminence of workplace fiscal inequality demonstrates the importance of fiscally liberal policies. 
Conservative tax policies, like joint-filing, is also a stealthy way to discriminate against women, especially married women. Alieza Durana of Slate Magazine wrote that women who file their taxes jointly are often taxed at a disproportionately higher rate than they would if they were a single filer, and that makes it harder for women to accumulate wealth. 
Unfortunately, this policy is still in place. Conservative tax policies, one of which heavily taxes groceries and clothing, reinforce social norms and gender roles which, when forced, are harmful to women’s independence and freedom. 
Fortunately, economic and social liberal movements, such as fair pay acts, zero tolerance for sexual harassment in the workplace (Times Up), extended maternity leave benefits and the call to attention of the mistreatment women face (Women’s March), often incorporate elements of political activism to close the wage gap. 
They also have allowed women more equality and choice in the workplace than before. Though there is much work to be done, progress has been made. Only by voting for liberal policies that eliminate sexist structures of financial oppression can women control their own livelihoods. 
Conservative fiscal policy typically has the least forgiving tax policy for poor people, as exemplified by Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump late last year and, according to economist Greg Leiserson, will noticeably increase disparities in after-tax income by 2025. 
With economic policies, conservatives want to keep the minimum wage low, tax the rich lightly (thereby moving the burden to the lower and middle class) in the name of “promoting business,” cut spending on social programs like Medicaid and food stamps that attempt to ameliorate issues people face, and more. 
Being fiscally conservative rather than liberal fails to fix a broken system and leaves millions of Americans vulnerable to poverty. 
Here’s the bottom line: if people are poor, it is nearly impossible to be empowered. Economic equality is social equality, and the stance of being socially liberal and fiscally conservative is not only oxymoronic but actively harmful to minority groups. 
Remember that at the polls on Nov. 6.

Joscelyn Stocks | Daily Trojan
“That doesn’t vibe with you,” my roommate said as he entered our dorm to see me hanging up an American flag. 
I understand what he meant. People assume that because I believe in climate change and Texas Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke I must not love the United States — at least not in its current form as “Trump’s America.” 
Those in power may oppose nearly every moral conviction I hold, but I still love my country. 
I’m a proud patriot. I value my American identity for what I believe it stands for — not for what President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, conservative commentator Tucker Carlson or any right wing jingoist believes it stands for. 
American patriotism doesn’t require a sense of superiority to those who are different than you. It requires humility and openmindedness. 
The U.S. was built upon mixed cultures and ideas; to truly love and respect our national heritage is to cherish our diversity and our ever-evolving identity. That’s what I love about America, and that’s why I know that I’m a patriot. 
Conversely, Trump recently defined his patriotism, confessing at a rally that he’s “absolutely a nationalist,” demonstrating a much more nefarious and combative definition of national pride. 
Nationalism isn’t a love of country, it’s a supremacy complex of country; and a very specific and fictitious country at that. 
In the modern lexicon and as used by Trump, nationalism is often viewed as the inverse of globalism. Nationalism focuses mostly on how issues affect Americans, while globalism takes a more cosmopolitan approach, seeking primarily to debunk the notion that the prosperity of one nation must come at the expense of another’s. It has led to an increased interconnectivity across the planet, and many have seen that as an attack on their homogenous vision of an “American identity.” 
There’s a bigoted connotation to this new nationalism. 
When it’s combined with the Trumpist slogan, “Make America Great Again,” it implies that some essential American identity is being lost — but it is a troublingly specific version of American identity. 
It’s an identity based in the traditional, white, homogenous interpretation of America, prioritizing white Americans at the cost of any “others.” It’s an identity that clings to images of American identity, while ignoring the substantive American values of equality and classical liberalism. 
This is demonstrated by the controversy in the NFL in which nationalists declared it more important to stand for the national anthem than to listen to the majority of Americans protesting the criminalization of black people in America. 
This is the line of reasoning that gained Trump the endorsement of white nationalist groups like the Ku Klux Klan, the Proud Boys and Unite the Right, as well as allowing the political climate to breed domestic terrorists such as Cesar Sayoc and Robert Bowers. 
I find this a perverse interpretation of the American identity, and believe in a more inclusive form of national pride. I believe America’s potential lies in its ability to progress rather than regress to when it was “great” for only the white elite. 
I believe in the progressive nature of our founding documents, which canonized into governance an affirmation that there are unalienable, natural rights, and that no individual should be thought of as less than another in their claim to those rights. 
It’s common knowledge that the Founding Fathers were slave owners, and the most egalitarian line in the Declaration of Independence stated that it was only men who were “created equal” — yet I turn again to these documents’ potential. 
The Founding Fathers gave tools for the creation of constitutional amendments and their successors used those tools to adapt the Constitution to the needs of their era. Slavery was abolished, an equal protections clause was adopted and women were given the right to vote. 
These moral revolutions weren’t fought for by cynical, indifferent political agents, but by passionate patriots who wanted their vision of American potential fulfilled. Just as that desire was necessary for our entire national history, it is necessary today. 
It is a tragedy that patriotism, a concept based in love, has been claimed by hateful people. The recovery of our current sociopolitical state requires not just a legal reclamation of the moral values associated with justice, equity and progress, but a symbolic reclamation of those American values as well. 
When the tides turn, and America’s collective moral conscience once again lands on higher ground, I plan to love that destination, just as I had when it was merely a vision. I’m a frustrated soyboy, beta-cuck, snowflake, but I still believe in what New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker frequently says: “If America hasn’t broken your heart, you probably don’t love her enough.”
I have a flag in my dorm so that when America comes out on the right side of history, I will know my pride was deserved. Resistance is patriotism, voting is resistance, love is voting. Vote on Nov. 6.

The Department of Public Safety issued a sexual battery alert Monday, informing students to take precaution when using ride sharing apps like Lyft and Uber.
The crime alert comes after a student reported being sexually harassed by her driver at 1:45 a.m. on Oct. 28. 
The student requested a ride from the 901 Bar and Grill on Figueroa Street and entered the passenger seat of what she believed to be her ride share car, according to the alert. 
The alert said the student yelled at the driver, who pulled over and let her out of the car at 27th Street.
The DPS assistant chief David Carlisle said the case is currently under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department with assistance from DPS. He said that anyone who witnessed the event or has had a similar experience should contact DPS. 
Carlisle said students should take precautions when using rideshare applications, such as riding with friends when possible. Students should also verify that the vehicle they enter is the one listed on the app and that their driver matches with the photograph, he said. 
“Most ride services, as we all know, are legitimate,” Carlisle said. “It is always a good idea to be safe and probably the best first choice is USC Campus Cruiser.”
The DPS alert stated that students can use services like Lyft’s “share your ETA” function to text their estimated time of arrival with friends and a live map to track rides. The alert also said students could call a friend and stay on the line until they reach their destination. 
“Make smart choices,” Carlisle said. “If the situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t, so one should stop and think a second time, and when in doubt stop and call DPS.”

Iovine and Young Academy’s new minors will allow more non-majors to explore Iovine and Young courses. (Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan)
USC’s Iovine and Young Academy announced four new minors to be introduced in Spring 2019. 
Students will have the option of taking classes geared towards a product design, disruptive innovation, designing for experience or multimedia for designers and entrepreneurs minor. 
“[These minors] represent key elements of the Academy’s uniquely integrative Bachelor of Science curriculum,” Iovine and Young Academy Dean Erica Muhl wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We are extremely pleased to finally be able to offer them to all majors at USC.”
While Iovine and Young has offered “The Practice of Design” and “The Art of Japan’s Golden Age of Animation” as general education courses for non-majors, the introduction of these four new minors give USC students the opportunity to take more classes in the Academy. 
“The addition of minors has also been planned from the beginning, and we have been designing and launching portions of the necessary coursework each semester for several years now,” Muhl wrote.  
The product design minor gives students the opportunity to learn about the creation of consumer goods and services and the application of acquired knowledge and skills in the areas of user research, according to the IYA website. 
The multimedia for designers and entrepreneurs minor offers students the skills and knowledge necessary to become entrepreneurs, content creators and experienced designers through a developed understanding of multimedia arts. 
“It is our hope that the minors will prove even more useful to students by providing not just greater access to Academy coursework, but also to the maker and ideation spaces coming in Iovine and Young Hall in Fall 2019,” Muhl wrote.
Jean Daniel LeRoy, a sophomore in the Academy, said he recommends that students consider pursuing the new minors.
“[It is] a hands on curriculum, which is a big reason why I joined the Academy, as well,” he said.
Those who choose to take classes for a disruptive innovation minor will learn about inventions that have radically changed society. These programs will allow students to cultivate an understanding of techniques and methodologies of innovators, according to the Academy’s site.  
The designing for experiences minor introduces the field of interaction design and universal design theory to students. The minor is intended for students who wish to specialize in data visualization, app design and social media development. 
“[The minors] are an opportunity for any students to get active. There’s not a lot of awareness of what it is like inside of the Academy,” LeRoy said. “This program will help make it more accessible to everyone else.” 
To apply for the minors, students must complete a minor prerequisite courses with a minimum of a B-minus grade and be in good academic standing at the University. 
The Academy notes, however, that students have the ability to petition to substitute classes taken in another USC college to cover the prerequisite requirement.

(Left to right) Students Simon Blessenohl, Naman Kedia, Vishal Rahane, Danyang Zhang and Zhengao Dong and professor Kyle Konis helped develop TrojanSense. (Dimple Sarnaaik | Daily Trojan)
Sometimes, temperatures in USC buildings can be too low. That’s why Kyle Konis, an assistant professor of architecture, worked with seven students to develop TrojanSense, an  app that allows users to recommend temperature changes in buildings by using a virtual thermostat. 
Supported by the Green Engagement Fund, the team worked to decrease the amount of energy wasted by the amount of air conditioning used on campus. 
“The app basically gives students, faculty and everyone on campus a voice,” said Naman Kedia, a sophomore majoring in computer science and iOS developer for TrojanSense. “They’re able to say ‘Hey, this room is too cold, so I want it two degrees hotter.’ Before, there was no mechanism of doing that, so if you were cold, you would just have to deal with it.” 
According to the UC Berkeley’s Center for the Built Environment Setpoint Savings Calculator, a two-degree increase in room temperatures in Los Angeles would save 32 percent of energy in heating, ventilation and air conditioning. 
“We have essentially a city within a city here at USC,” Konis said. “[USC] can be a test bed, not just for developing sensors and technology, but also starting to learn how to engage better with the actual users of the campus.”
Since a large portion of USC’s electricity usage comes from air conditioning, Konis said the results of the temperature suggestions made by users will be reported to USC Facilities Management Services every semester. 
In this effort, the project team hopes that FMS will take the feedback into consideration when evaluating what temperatures each building should be altered to in order to increase comfort and improve sustainability.  
Some classrooms have installed beacons to automatically detect which building the user is in while on the app, according to Kedia. However, if the user is not near a beacon, there is a feature on TrojanSense that allows them to manually select the building and room number to recommend a temperature.
So far, Kedia said there is a pattern of people wanting rooms to be warmer, especially in places like Wallis Annenberg Hall lobby. 
Konis said his research prior to creating TrojanSense in Fall 2017 led to this student-driven project. He collected feedback and subjective response data from buildings in operation so that researchers could better understand how the buildings performed from the perspective of its occupants.
TrojanSense project manager Simon Blessenohl, a graduate student studying philosophy, said that although the app has already been released, the team plans on making improvements. 
“There are a lot of potentials for the development we could do,” Blessenohl said. “Right now, our main concern is outreach. We want to spread the word and see whether people find [the app] useful, whether they want to use it…. Another thing we are working on is to have a nice visualization of the feedback that people are giving. You can imagine a map of the campus and then the buildings with colors depending on if people think they’re too warm or too cold.”
Konis also said that TrojanSense is different from other smart city projects because the app prioritizes engagement and input from the USC community over sophisticated means of surveillance. By collecting app data and submitting it to FMS, Konis hopes TrojanSense will provide evidence that may make University buildings simpler and more environmentally responsive. 
“We want users to feel like they have an interface to the building that they are in or interface to  the room that they’re in, that they don’t currently have,” Konis said. “Hopefully, students feel like they’re now getting more of a means of actually participating in the temperature management of the space, but also the energy management and the sustainability of the campus.”

Senior Alexina Boudreaux-Allen won a paid trip to a music festival during the Red Bull Hack the Hits hackathon after building a mask for DJs and electronic music performers with a team of students. (Julia Mazzucco | Daily Trojan)
A USC senior and two other students from Stanford University and Berklee College of Music won an all-expense paid trip to a mystery music festival at the Red Bull Hack the Hits hackathon from Oct. 12 to 15 thanks to their instrument invention, the Beat Mask, which was built in just 48 hours.
The winning team, known as the USBs, comprises Alexina Boudreaux-Allen, a computer science student at USC, Raul Dagir from Stanford and Claire Lim from the Berklee. 
Boudreaux-Allen said that her team’s interests in music and technology inspired them to create Beat Mask, a mask for DJs and electronic music performers with a machine learning algorithm that transforms voice input into live electronically-produced music. 
“One of the things that we all had in common is that we’re all performers,” Boudreaux-Allen said. “We just wanted to see if we could find a way to make electronic performances to be more live-feeling, like for audiences.”
The product was constructed from a $4 spray painting mask from Home Depot, Boudreaux-Allen said.
Using a microphone from Apple earphones, Beat Mask picks up the wearer’s beatboxing and replicates it electronically. The USBs also installed LED lights that flash with the music and a gyroscope that captures movement and controls music effects.  
“Being able to make something that can make a electronic producer have a more engaging set with their audience, we just thought that sounded hype, because we all perform,” Boudreaux-Allen added. 
The only instruction the five groups participating were given at the hackathon was to create anything that makes sound, according to Boudreaux-Allen. However, there were a few guidelines: instruments had to be a physical product and produce sound in a musical way. 
The criteria for a winning project included musicality, innovation, usability and awesomeness, according to Julie Covello, also known as DJ Shakey, one of the five hackathon judges. 
Beat Mask managed to pull together all aspects and pulled ahead with its high technicality and visual engagement, according to Covello. 
“It did have a high technical capability, which was incorporating the artificial intelligence and all that, which is great,” Covello said. “But I don’t want to see an instrument that only does that. It also looked really weird and unique. It had blinking lights on it, and it also had synth functions:you could turn a knob and you could filter a sound.”
Matt Moldover, one of the five mentors in the music industry that helped teams over the 48-hour period, initially worried about the winning team because they spent the most time in the ideation stage. 
“Conceptualizing a mask as a musical instrument is something I don’t think I’ve ever seen before,” Moldover said. “It won in the novelty department and in the presentation department, and in the way they pulled it together.”
The team worked through obstacles with machine learning with help from mentors like Moldover and USC alumnus Mike Gao, who specializes in the area of programming and software.
“I’m a graduating senior right now, and I have no idea what I want to do with my life,” Boudreaux-Allen said. “But this hackathon … I thought it was freaking awesome  for multiple reasons, like one, you just get to like come up with an idea and just make it and see it all the way through. And that’s a really satisfying thing.”
