The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team will travel to No. 6 Long Beach State tonight in a rematch of the Trojans’ sweep over the 49ers earlier this season.
The Trojans (9-1, 9-1) methodically swept Cal State Northridge on Wednesday, winning at the Matadome for the first time in nine matches. Against the Matadors, they hit .636 for the game, with senior opposite Murphy Troy, senior outside hitter Tri Bourne and junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli all finishing with double-digit kills.
Despite 16 errors at the service line, a defense intent on stopping the bread-and-butter middle attack and a flat atmosphere, the Trojans focused and executed.
“I was really happy that we adapted,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “Since they took away the middle, we went outside and Murphy [Troy] and Tony [Ciarelli] really got better at the end of the match because of those opportunities.”
Long Beach State (8-5, 7-3) boasts a considerably better record than Cal State Northridge, good for third in the conference.
“They are going to be entirely better,” Ferguson said. “They had an off night last time. They also have a couple new guys that are stepping up.”
Long Beach State outside hitter Brad Hemmerling recorded a career-high 16 kills in a sweep over Pepperdine on Wednesday. Prior to the Pepperdine match, he had only played in eight sets this season.
The 49ers also feature one of the nation’s best middle blockers in Antwain Aguillard.
“They have a big pair of middle blockers,” Troy said. “But we won’t need to do alter anything drastically.”
Aguillard ranks third in the conference in blocks, one spot shy of Trojan senior middle blocker Austin Zahn.
“He’s an offensive threat,” senior setter Riley McKibbin said. “But we’re not going to work around him or anything. We’ll stick to our game plan.”
The Trojans have won the last five meetings against the 49ers.
“The combination of the good volleyball and the good, knowledgeable crowd is really good for volleyball,” Ferguson said. “It’s gonna be a crankin’ place.”
To add to an already raucous home atmosphere, Long Beach State will be honoring its 1991 championship team before Friday’s match. The Trojans happened to be the runners-up that year.
“I feel like every team that plays us does this,” McKibbin said. “They always honor some team that beat USC like 20 years ago when they play us. All we’re focusing on is extending our streak and keeping our No. 1 spot.”
First serve is at the Long Beach State Walter Pyramid at 7 p.m.

The USC women’s basketball team ran out of gas late against Arizona State on Thursday and dropped a game with significant postseason implications, falling 69-55 in the desert.
Missing the mark · Junior guard Ashley Corral, pictured here against UCLA, went just 2-of-7 from beyond the arc against the Sun Devils. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Trailing for much of the second half, USC (16-10, 8-7) mounted one final surge and closed the gap to 52-48 before running out of gas. When the final buzzer sounded, the Women of Troy found themselves on the wrong side of a 17-7 run.
“The team that showed up against Cal and UCLA [last week] didn’t show up tonight,” said freshman forward Cassie Harberts.  “We played really soft tonight. We didn’t execute our plays, we didn’t rebound.”
With the loss, the Women of Troy moved back to fourth place in the Pac-10, behind Stanford, UCLA and the Sun Devils (17-8, 9-6). The loss ensured that USC, which has three three games remaining, wouldn’t reach coach Michael Cooper’s goal of 20 wins during the regular season.
USC held a 39-38 advantage midway through the second half when the team lost its shooting touch.  The Women of Troy missed nine of 10 shots and saw their one-point advantage turn into a 48-41 lead for the Sun Devils.
Led by Harberts and junior guard Briana Gilbreath, the Women of Troy had one last rally left in them. The pair combined for all seven of USC’s points during the run.
Gilbreath led the Women of Troy with 17 points and six rebounds.  Freshman forward Cassie Harberts added 10 points and eight rebounds despite battling foul trouble all game. No other player scored in double figures for USC. As a team, the Women of Troy shot 38 percent from the floor.
Dymond Smith led Arizona State with 22 points, including seven points during the decisive run. Arizona State also struggled from the field, but converted 21 of its 23 free throw attempts. The Sun Devils made 15 free throws in the second half alone, compared to just 11 all game for the Women of Troy.
Neither team could get much separation in a back-and-forth first half that saw the teams trade baskets. Arizona State stretched the lead to 28-21 for a brief moment only to see USC rattle off seven straight points to knot the score back up.
“They were attacking the basket but I thought we were too,” Harberts said. “[Arizona State] was getting ticky-tacky calls. At one point in the second half we had seven fouls and they only had one.”
Next up for USC is a Saturday tilt against Arizona in a game that will determine fourth place in the conference standings.  The Wildcats dropped to 7-8 in league play with a narrow loss on Thursday.
“[Tonight’s loss] makes the game against Arizona ten times more important,” Harberts said.  “We needed to win tonight; now we need to win the rest of our games.”

This city is one that’s supposed to have eternal sunshine and always be 75, without a cloud in the sky.
But for some reason, Los Angeles decided to take a vacation last week and Seattle came and raided its house while it was gone.
But while it was tough to figure out Los Angeles, it wasn’t tough to figure out the USC baseball team.
Even rain, which causes frat houses to cancel parties, couldn’t stop the Trojans.
Yes, they went 2-1 in their opening tournament at Dedeaux Field, losing 11-7 in the championship game to perennial top-20 team North Carolina, but after a 6-3 road win at UC Riverside that brings USC’s record to 3-1 on the year, the forecast is beginning to look sunny for the Trojans.
These first four games are a sign that USC baseball is on the upswing.
The Trojans showcased some great young talent, beginning with freshman Jake Hernandez, who went 2-for-4 with two RBIs against UNC, freshman pitcher Kyle Richter, who picked up the win by pitching one and two-thirds innings of scoreless relief against Riverside, and freshman shortstop James Roberts, who has only two hits in 13 at-bats, but also has three RBIs and has started all four games.
The Trojans also have a great new coach.
USC made progress before the season even started by firing Chad Kreuter — who was a mediocre coach at best, compiling a 111-117 record in his four years at USC — in the offseason.
In stepped Frank Cruz as the interim coach, and he’s done a fantastic job so far.
The former manager of the USA baseball team, Cruz has been very proactive, getting a lot of players playing time early on so he can find the right mix while players gain experience all across the board.
But I think the biggest positive  in these first four games is that in all four games, the Trojans left something to be desired.
All weekend they left runners stranded, most of them in scoring position.
All told, USC has left 36 players on base, which averages to nine per game.
If USC can score just a quarter of those runners, it could be a very good team.
Make no mistake, the Trojans still have a long way to go before being a consistently good team.
I am aware it is still ridiculously early in the season. But they are rounding first.
With a win at Rice tonight, the Trojans have a chance to be three games above .500 for the first time since April 2009.
That just shows how bad USC has been recently.
Three games above .500 won’t win you any NCAA Championships or even Pac-10 titles anytime soon.
It might get you into the tournament.
For a team predicted to finish ninth in the Pac-10, however, three games above .500 ain’t too shabby.
To complement the young talent, USC has a solid squad of veteran players it hasn’t seen in a while.
Junior Ricky Oropesa leads the way as a preseason All-American, and he hasn’t disappointed thus far.
The first basemen is batting .267 with four RBIs, including a clutch two-out, bases-clearing double to tie the game at 7 against the Tar Heels in the bottom of the sixth inning. Senior Joe De Pinto is proving a leader as well, batting a monstrous .643 with six runs and three RBIs.
Not to be forgotten, newcomer Austin Wood has proved a steady hand.
The community college pitcher who was picked in the fourth round by the Tampa Bay Rays is 1-0 with a 3.60 ERA so far.
These three players, combined with another handful of juniors, give the Trojans depth but also stability as they look forward to this year.
They have a very big challenge with three games at No. 22 Rice this weekend.
If the Trojans can take two of three from the Owls, they will off to their best start in recent memory.
Baseball at USC is a heritage, and an honored tradition that has been missing for dozens of years.
Many current Trojans would probably find it hard to believe USC holds the record for national championships with 12, and has only won one of those since 1979.
I don’t see a championship coming in the next year or two, but I do see a program on the rise that has been in the cellar for many years.
Expect USC baseball to finish higher than ninth place in the conference this season as it begins to move toward a brighter future.
“Spittin’ Sports” runs Fridays. To comment on this article e-mail Kenny at klegan@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.
We HAVE to get back to being the Trojans on the baseball field that we are supposed to be, the one that everyone hears and reads about!
FIGHT ON!!

USC junior pitcher Andrew Triggs ended last season with a 2-7 record and an injury that sidelined him for nearly the final month of the season.
He will take the mound today at Rice University in Houston as the Trojans’ top starter.
Opening debut · In his season debut against Missouri, starting pitcher Andrew Triggs allowed three runs through four and two-thirds innings. -  Daily Trojan file photo 
“It’s a total 180 from where I really expected to be,” Triggs said. “I’m so pumped. It’s gonna be a blast.”
The Trojans (3-1) open up a three-game weekend series today against No. 22 Rice at 2:30 p.m. It’s just another typical weekend against a ranked team for the Trojans, whose schedule includes nine teams currently in the top 25.
Don’t be deceived by the Owls’ 2-3 record — two of those losses came last weekend to No. 8 Stanford. They lost to unranked Lamar on Tuesday and held off Texas State by one run Wednesday.
The Trojans certainly do not take those as a sign of weakness.
“They’re a good team, so they’re gonna be fired up,” Triggs said. “They’re gonna be ready to play. Don’t left records deceive you. It’s really early in the season, and they’re always one of those teams vying for a trip to Omaha.”
There is no doubt about the talent the Owl’s possess.
Rice infielder Anthony Rendon could easily be the first overall pick in this year’s MLB draft.
“We’re gonna have to play our best to beat them,” said USC coach Frank Cruz. “We’ll really have to be on top of it.”
As pitching goes, the Trojans have it pretty good. On the mound Saturday will be junior Austin Wood, the No. 22-ranked junior prospect in the nation and a former fourth-round draft pick of the Tampa Bay Rays.
Senior Logan Odom will take the hill Sunday after keeping the Trojans in the game last Sunday against No. 24 North Carolina.
Cruz has a new goal for his pitching staff: three walks or less for the entire game.
“Pitchers throwing strikes and executing is big for us,” Cruz said. “Against Riverside [on Tuesday] we used nine pitchers, and eight of them were pretty good.”
Timely hitting is also something USC could improve upon, as well.
The Trojans have left a staggering 36 men on base in their first four games.
But Cruz has seen improvement, especially in “small ball,” moving runners up base-by-base, as opposed to waiting for the three-run homer.
“There was some execution [on Tuesday] that I really liked,” Cruz said. “[Our] situational hitting was good. Also, offensively, we had a higher number of base on balls than we did strikeouts yesterday. And we’re really trying to focus on that a lot right now.”
There will be pressure on the middle of the Trojans lineup, particularly preseason All-American junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa, to match Rendon and the heart of the Rice order.
Oropesa exemplified situational hitting with a bases-loaded double with two outs and the count full last Sunday against North Carolina to tie the game.
“[Rendon] and Ricky [Oropesa] are two of the top hitters in the country,” Cruz said. “It will be a good series to feature the two of them.”
Defense, meanwhile, is something the Trojans appear to have down. They have committed just one error in their four games so far.
Chalk that one up to freshman nerves, as the middle infield combination of freshman shortstop James Roberts and senior second baseman and captain Joe De Pinto is about as solid as they come.
“[De Pinto’s] given me a lot of pointers,” Roberts said. “As a freshman I’m not quite as consistent as seniors are, so he gets on me. He’s definitely improved my game.”
Regardless of the outcome of its trip to Houston, the team insists that it can only stand to gain from the experience.
“Early season road trips like this weather you take a series or come up short it’s good for cohesiveness,” Triggs said. “Instead of being around guys for four hours a day you’re around them for 24 hours a day. We already have good chemistry, but these kinds of trips only help. They’re a lot of fun.”

Before the game against No. 10 Arizona, the bobbleheads of USC coach Kevin O’Neill that were handed out to the energetic Galen Center crowd optimistically nodded their heads up and down.
Inside force · Junior forward Nikola Vucevic finished with yet another double-double on Thursday night with a game-high 25 points and 12 rebounds. By comparison, Arizona’s scoring leader, Derrick Williams, was held to a season-low eight points. - Carolo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
The real O’Neill had plenty to smile about watching the Trojans (16-12, 8-7) play against his former team, as USC upset the Wildcats (23-5, 12-3) with a thrilling second-half comeback, 65-57.
Trailing 55-52 with 3:23 left in the game, USC closed the game on a 13-2 run, snapping Arizona’s eight-game winning streak.
The Trojans won the game with their defense. They held the Wildcats to a season-low 57 points, and snapped their eight-game winning streak. Arizona’s leading scorer, forward Derrick Williams, only managed to score eight points, which marked the first time this season he scored in single digits.
“What I have seen out of our guys is a resolve to play defensively,” O’Neill said. “If we keep that resolve, we will have a chance to keep winning games. If we do not keep that resolve, we can lose to anybody, anytime, anywhere.”
It is the first time that the Trojans have won three games in a row this season, after wins at California and Stanford last weekend.
“We have a lot of work left to do, but you can see there is a little bit of hope at the end of the tunnel if we keep playing hard,” O’Neill said.
Arizona was the third ranked opponent the Trojans have defeated, after wins against Texas and Tennessee.
Arizona started the game cold, only making two of its first nine shots. The Trojans failed to take advantage of Arizona’s shooting woes, however, only making two of their first six shots.
Midway through the first half, with the Trojans trailing by four, O’Neill picked up a technical foul, and Arizona went on a 6-2 run.
Junior guard Jio Fontan then sparked a Trojans rally, scoring eight of USC’s final 12 points of the half as Arizona’s lead shrank to 28-25 by halftime.
“Jio kept us in the game in the first half,” O’Neill said. “He controlled the game.”
Only three USC players — Fontan, senior forward Alex Stepheson and junior forward Nikola Vucevic — scored in the first half.
Williams, the reigning Pac-10 Men’s Basketball Player of the Week, who came into the game averaging 19.7 points and 8.1 rebounds per game for Arizona, struggled in the first half. He only scored four points on 2-6 shooting and had four rebounds in the opening half.
The Trojans came out of the locker room after halftime and started the second half on a 7-0 run. Once USC regained the lead, it held it until 10:58 left in the game.
Arizona then regained the lead and did not relinquish it until Stepheson made two free throws to give the Trojans a 58-56 lead with just under two minutes left in the game.
Two free throws by Vucevic extended USC’s lead to four points.
Arizona guard Kyle Fogg only made one of two free throws to cut USC’s advantage to 60-57.
The Wildcats decided to foul, making the Trojans win the game at the free-throw line, which they were able to do. USC made 22 of 27 free throws in the game.
“We played with poise and confidence down the stretch,” O’Neill said.
Not everything was positive for USC. The Trojans only had four points off the bench, all from freshman guard Maurice Jones, while the Wildcats’ bench scored 20 points. USC only made one of 10 three-point attempts.
Vucevic led the Trojans with 25 points and 12 rebounds, despite often being double-teamed when he touched the ball.
“Vucevic is a really great player,” Williams said. “He is a top five player in the [conference], and a definite NBA player. He averages [17.2 points and 10.2 rebounds per game]. That is better than me. He should get more credit.”
Fontan tied his season-high with 21 points, while Stepheson had 12 points and 10 rebounds.
“This win was a big confidence booster,” Fontan said. “We have to keep going. We cannot let up.”
The Trojans will host Arizona State on Saturday at 4:30 p.m. in the final home game of the regular season.
The Sun Devils (10-16, 2-12) are led by guard Trent Lockett, who averages 13.9 points and 5.4 rebounds per game.
Arizona State presents a very balanced squad, with 11 players averaging 10 or more minutes per game, compared to seven players for USC.
The Trojans and Sun Devils played Jan. 27, with USC coming out on top, 63-61. In that game, Vucevic had 26 points and 12 rebounds, helping the Trojans earn their first conference road win. USC struggled to contain guard Rihards Kuksiks, who had a season-high 22 points.
Coming into Thursday night, the Sun Devils had lost nine of their last 10 games.
Before the game on Saturday, USC will honor its four departing seniors: guard James Dunleavy, guard Marcus Simmons, guard Donte Smith and Stepheson.
Note: This story reflects an updated version that ran Friday, Feb. 25.
Unfortunately for Arizona, that’s what happens when you’re on a winning streak and moving up in the rankings. USC’s effort was great, but they aren’t consistent enough to make a run.

On the heels of a three-win week, senior Maria Sanchez and the rest of the USC women’s tennis team hit the road against in-state rival San Diego today.
Behind their recent success, which include victories against USF, Texas, and San Diego State, the Women of Troy (6-1) have garnered national attention.
Sanchez not only was awarded her fourth career Pac-10 Player of the Week award, but she was voted the nation’s top singles player.
She currently has a 15-match win streak, and holds a 20-1 overall singles record.
Despite sometimes playing in Sanchez’s shadow, sophomore Danielle Lao has continued to ride the momentum from her ITA Southwest Regional Singles Championship last fall (where she beat Sanchez in the finals) and carved out a name for herself, as her No. 25 singles rankings reflect.
USC coach Richard Gallien’s group sits at a well-deserved No. 17 in the latest ITA Rankings, as they look to improve on its 6-1 record against the No. 27 Toreros.
Coming of a 7-0 drubbing of UC Irvine, San Diego (5-2) is led by singles ace Stephanie Hoffpauir, who sits at No. 66 in the nation.
Even though USC may have a plethora of talent among its top players, there is no questioning the overall excellence that the entire team has enjoyed so far this year.
Alison Ramos and Valeria Pulido has combined to form a devastating doubles’ duo that currently ranks 11th in the nation with a 16-5 record.
While Ramos has struggled in singles play recently, she remains a serviceable player and one who has the trust of  Gallien because of her experience and tenacity.
“It’s just the nature of tennis,” Gallien said of Ramos’ recent struggles, “She’s had some heartbreaking losses and she caught some bad luck, but she’ll be fine.”
Pulido, on the other hand, has been a dominant force, winning her last seven singles matches in fine fashion.
Unheralded freshman Kaitlyn Christian, who also teams with Sanchez in doubles’ matches, has provided a rock solid presence at the No. 4 spot in singles, racking up a 15-5 record on the year. Her three-set win against UT’s Juliana Gajic displayed her ability to battle back from adversity.
With a road battle against arch-rival UCLA looming ahead, the Women of Troy shouldn’t take this match against San Diego lightly. Instead, Sanchez and Co. should use Friday as a tune-up to iron out any potential flaws and to prepare for their upcoming Pac-10 play.

Seven games into the season and the USC women’s water polo team is looking strong and maintaining their competitive spirit.
This weekend, the team is looking to have a successful tournament in front of their families at the UC Irvine Invitational.
After last week’s decisive victories against Long Beach State and San Diego State, USC remains at No. 2.
First on the docket is No. 18 UC San Diego on Saturday morning.
This weekend is important for the team as they look to continue to prove themselves in the water.
As an added push, the teams this weekend will be playing all their games close to home at UC Irvine’s Anteater Aquatic Complex, and they look to receive some added encouragement and support from their families.
“I think it’s special to be able to play in front of our families,” said senior driver Joelle Bekhazi. “Since we’re in Irvine, we’ll have a lot more friends there too. UC Irvine is usually our big tournament where we come out number one so hopefully we can keep doing it again and show every that we’re amazing.”
The girls also are looking to team bonding this weekend as they entertain the possibility of once again competing against rivals UCLA and Stanford. Their level of confidence needs to be high, and they understand their level of confidence rises the more they can rely on one another for advice and encouragement.
“I think they biggest thing here is that we’re a family. We’re together,” said senior two-meter Sarah Van Norman. “Nobody knows what we go through day in and day out with our coaching staff, with each other, and I think that’s what builds our bonds and keeps us strong. We’ve done all the grunt work and it’s going to bring us all together at the end.”
The Women of Troy (6-1) know that they can depend on one another for support, and they believe this is a large part of why they have so many rising players and a plethora they can count on to score goals and always be prepared to play.
“Coach [Jovan Vavic] is very big on being a selfless team,” Bekhazi said. “This is why we win — because we have such diverse girls and we can all shoot the ball. We all set each other up; we all work for each other. It’s not like we have just three talented girls. We have 18 talented girls. Drop off any one of us, and we’re still all going to finish.”
The diversity accounts for much of the team’s success and high goal scoring, but the team also knows that this weekend they have to play hard on both sides of the ball to be able to win their way to be Invitational Champions.

Benjamin Reese, who graduated from USC’s School of Cinematic Arts in 2010 with a degree in interactive entertainment, has a job which many on campus would envy: He works for Walt Disney Imagineering. The Daily Trojan spoke with Reese in a phone interview.
Magic · Benjamin Reese graduated last May from the USC School of Cinematic Arts, and helped create games for kids on the Disney Dream. -  Courtesy of Benjamin Reese 
Daily Trojan: What does Imagineering mean?
Benjamin Reese: Imagineering is the organization within Walt Disney Company which creates all of the attractions and experiences for the theme parks across the globe. We design, build and execute those projects. We also do work on the Disney cruise lines, so it’s actually a pretty large scope and we’re a pretty large organization.
DT: Is there any specific project you work on?
Reese: I assist in a lot of the projects in the first stage of development, a lot of conceptualization and brainstorming. I’m involved in a lot of those which unfortunately I cannot talk about. But there’s a few that I’ve been able to work on.
The new Disney Dream [Cruise]— which just launched some of the interactive games in the kids’ space —  I was involved in some of the play-testing for that, as well as a project I actually produced and was in-charge-of-ish that just got installed in Walt Disney World in Epcot about a month ago, that’s called “Compose Your Own Figment.”
It’s a little interactive kiosk experience where you create your own Figment character, and I got to be involved with that, which was a big privilege and a really great opportunity for an intern to be able to do something like that.
DT: Did you always want to be an imagineer?
Reese: I actually didn’t, I didn’t really know it was an option and didn’t really think about it too much — it just came out of nowhere. I’d always known what Imagineering was and thought that it was a really cool company, so it was really exciting to get the opportunity to work with them and work on some projects there. It’s been a great privilege.
DT: How does what you learned at USC help you at your job?
Reese: The interactive entertainment major is all about game design, and that’s something that has been very useful for me at my current job, because a lot of my job is thinking of fun guest experiences.
DT: What types of activities were you involved in at USC?
Reese: I played junior varsity hockey for the USC Trojans my freshman year; that’s a club sport. I was really heavily involved with InterVarsity Trojan Christian Fellowship on campus as well.
DT: What was your favorite class at USC?
Reese: That is a hard one. One of the ones that had the greatest impact on my personality and how I approach life was completely unrelated my major, it just affected the way I think and the way I act. It’s called Theater Games and Improvisation, THTR 122, with Eric Trules.
DT: What is your best memory from USC?
Reese: That’s very difficult. I think my consistent best memories are late-night TroGro runs.
DT: What is one piece of advice you would give to current students?
Reese: Diversify your experience. I know that’s kind of hard for some of the engineering students, but I was an interactive entertainment major, and I took classes in pretty much everything. I just took stuff that was really interesting to me.

President C. L. Max Nikias led a group of USC faculty, deans and trustees to Mumbai, New Delhi and Bangalore this week, marking the first time a USC president has visited India with an official delegation.
Networking · President C. L. Max Nikias will be in India for 10 days. USC will be opening offices in the cities of Bangalore and Mumbai. - Courtesy of USC News 
Nikias, who also met with the Indian prime minister Feb. 24, hopes the trip will help USC build relationships with civic, academic and corporate leaders.
The trip, which began Sunday, will last 10 days, and will consist of meetings, receptions, presentations and the opening of USC offices in Bangalore and Mumbai.
“Our delegation’s visit to India represents USC’s commitment to being one of the first truly global universities and having an active presence in one of the world’s most dynamic, emerging societies,” Nikias wrote in an e-mail. “We already have extensive ties to India and we feel we’re in an excellent position to strengthen and broaden those ties.”
Nikias said he hopes expanding partnerships with India will be beneficial not only to USC, but also to the rest of the country.
“Working with them to address various economic, medical, cultural and environmental issues can help us influence how societies around the planet can tackle such challenges in the coming years,” Nikias wrote. “And in this globalized era, engagement with India also offers a tremendous educational advantage to USC’s students, both domestic and international.”
The opening of USC offices in Bangalore and Mumbai will allow for enhanced student recruiting, alumni relationship, fundraising and faculty engagement. USC also has offices in Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei and Mexico City.
Arvin Varma, adviser of the Association of Indian Students, said this is a historic moment and that it shows that USC’s administration is concerned with the needs of Indian students.
“It will be great for [Nikias] to actually experience Indian culture,” Varma said. “It will help him better relate with Indian student needs and what USC can do to make them more comfortable.”
Aseem Monga, a freshman of Indian descent majoring in computer science, said he has seen USC’s increasing presence in India.
“The major reason [Nikias] went to India is because he wants to get more Indian students to come to USC,” Monga said. “We’re seeing more USC advertisements in Indian newspapers.”
“USC can do to make them more comfortable”  yup.. we need to be cradled and cuddled.. seriously?? There are more important concerns than that.. Maybe increased tie ups with Research groups/companies in India, or some thing more fruitful.. However I am afraid that the reason for the visit (may be) is just to increase the enrollment…

USC Transportation has announced that its hours of operation will be shortened to accommodate more students at peak hours.
In a statement e-mailed to students and faculty Thursday, USC Transportation said that starting Feb. 28, the Campus Cruiser service will begin at 6 p.m. every night and end at 2:45 a.m. Currently, students can call for a ride between 5 p.m. and 2:45 a.m. daily.
Service · Campus Cruiser has changed its hours of operation to accommodate more students during peak hours. Cruiser will now run one hour less than what students are accustomed to. Some students say this change will have no affect on their usage. -  Daily Trojan file photo 
USC Transportation said the shortened Cruiser hours were made to improve the quality of the service.
“This will enable us to optimize our operation by focusing our resources on our high-demand periods,” the e-mail stated.
USC Transportation could not be reached for comment.
For many students, the hour lost in service is not at a time they would normally call Campus Cruiser. Peak hours for the service are generally later in the night.
According to the statistics from Feb. 8 posted on the USC Transportation website, 57 passengers used Campus Cruiser from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m., compared to 128 passengers at the peak hour of 10:00 p.m. to 10:59 p.m.
“From my experience, the most challenging time to get ahold of Campus Cruiser is after 8 p.m., and I assume that’s the most heavily trafficked time,” said Stephanie Irankunze, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “So moving the time an hour or two doesn’t seem to be a cause for concern.”
Late at night, when more students tend to use Campus Cruiser, it can often become more difficult to find an open car.
Despite the program’s shortened hours and high demand at peak hours, many students still feel Campus Cruiser provides a helpful service.
“It is a safe and convenient way to move around at night and on the many occasions we find ourselves unable, for any reason, to operate vehicles or travel around campus without putting ourselves and others in harm’s way,” Irankunze said. “In this regard it is extremely helpful.”

Students from the USC School of Social Work got together Thursday to air their grievances against their administration for abruptly changing the time and venue of their graduation ceremony, after an e-mail was accidentally sent to students by Dean Marilyn Flynn announcing the change.
Tension · Gwendolyn Jones (left), Donny Hang (center) and Benjat Khani talked about the unfairness of the change in the graduation time and place. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
The ceremony has been moved from 6 p.m., Friday, May 13 at the Shrine Auditorium, to 2 p.m. in an outside tent on campus to accommodate Jewish students and faculty who wish to observe Shabbat, a weekly day of rest beginning at sundown on Fridays.
Flynn’s e-mail, which was not supposed to go to students, stated that the School of Social Work did not originally “choose this option, because it is not air-conditioned, the sound is not particularly good, and it is simply less attractive from a ceremonial point of view.”
When students at the School of Social Work saw the e-mail, many were outraged.
“I respect Shabbat, but at the same time other religious events need to be taken into consideration as well,” said Danny Hang, a graduate student earning a dual degree from the School of Social Work and Davis School of Gerontology.
Students said they are not as upset about the change in venue or time as they are about the lack of equality for all students at a secular institution.
“I understand that point of view,” Flynn said, “But I would also say that in a very diverse school we have a lot of hard decisions to make. This is my decision. This is how I decided to resolve the conflict as I understood it. Not everybody will agree with that, but that’s my perception and that’s my decision.”
Administrators, including Hillary Chisum, director of Special Events and Suh Chen Hsiao, director of Student Affairs, attended a graduation committee meeting yesterday to speak to students personally about the change. A subsequent meeting will be held March 1 between students and Flynn.
The e-mail was simply a mistake that should not have happened, Flynn said.
“I certainly understand [the anger,]” Flynn said. “I’m going to be meeting with the students on March 1 so I can certainly apologize for the abruptness of the change.”
Though students are upset that their input wasn’t considered, Flynn maintains that students have been very involved in the graduation ceremony process.
“We have one of the most involved student groups in the nation, and especially compared to most student groups on campus,” Flynn said. “Anybody can serve on the [graduation] committee if they want to and that committee has been planning for graduation since last year, so students have definitely been involved in that component.”
Flynn encouraged students who have been especially inconvenienced to speak to her personally.
“I haven’t yet sent a formal announcement to the students; I certainly will be letting them know directly about the change,” Flynn said. “If any student has been inconvenienced, they can meet with me and we can talk about it.”
But students were left unsatisfied after yesterday’s one-hour meeting with school administrators.
“Nothing was resolved,” said Alberto Lopez, a senior receiving his masters in social work. “No questions were answered.”
Valerie Ayala, a senior receiving her master’s degree, agreed.
“[Chisum] was very understanding,” Ayala said, “[The administration] did make a very unilateral decision, but it is about consistency.”
Students with dual degrees are also worried because the ceremony’s time change to 2 p.m. might force them to decide which ceremony to go to. For example, the Gould School of Law is hosting its graduation ceremony at 3:30 p.m.
“The original time was chosen especially so students can attend both graduations,” Hang said. “Now we have to pick which to go to.”
Flynn said students will still receive an unlimited number of tickets for guests and remains confident that the tent will adequately house the ceremony.
“I think we’ll have a good graduation experience,” she said.
Punishing plagiarism and holding deans to high standards in their decisions should not be mutually exclusive. I say we follow through on both.
Are you absolutely sure? This isn’t just rumor?
If so, then I really do think something needs to be done about it.
You obviously know some facts… Why not make this more transparent? (without giving away student’s name). We can’t ask questions or have a more serious dialog without more facts.
Did the DT cover the meeting Dean Flynn had with the students? I do not see it anywhere today. If the DT did not cover this event then good job on a big time fail DT. Here is a story that garnered more comments then many of your stories by far and you decide not to follow up on it. That is world class journalism.
That is BS. If this is true, this student should be kicked out of the program.
How can you graduate if you fail a class?  Plagiarism = Fail.
hear hear!!
I just don’t understand why such an accommodation was made for a religious observance. What makes Shabbat so important to move a graduation date? Would the same have been done for another religious observance?
I’m not for or against the move, just curious as to why.
USC offers a joint degree with Hebrew Union College (MSW/MASTER OF ARTS IN JEWISH COMMUNAL SERVICE ). While USC is secular, it is important to take into account the diversity of all of our students. There were two times slots available for graduation for the MSW graduation.  The 2pm slot ensured that more students could attend the ceremony.
Dean Flynn should run thru the events step by step that led her to decide to change the graduation plans. This is the secretive part that would be better if it was transparent. Did some alumni call her or administrator call this to her attention? Obviously something/someone must have alerted her to the conflict with Shabbat or else this would not have been scheduled when it originally was. Please Dean Flynn – explain what events led to your decision? How were you first made aware of this conflict?
???  Where do you get this sense of entitlement? Why does she have to report to you?  The graduation is now more inclusive. How about we put this energy into making our graduation awesome? Ideas, suggestions, join the grad committee, etc?
Don’t preach about entitlement when you are advocating for the observance of the Shabbat for some at the detriment of all.
I know  I have made an impact when someone on this site feels compelled to imitate me at 9:50 PM last night and make a fake post pretending I am sorry! This is great! That same person probably has his entire Jewish family donate a lot of money in the past to USC so things like the Shabbat can be taken seriously. Thank you for validating that you feel I have made to most impact to this argument since if you can not debate someone on rational terms you do what most cheap political hacks do – you try and confuse the whole ball of wax.
Remember people – the important lesson here is that it is very important to retain absolute literal interpretation of scripture! That is the key to success in the 21st Cent!
No one really needs to imitate you to highlight your arrogance, intolerance, or ignorance. You do a fine job of doing that yourself.
I am a member of the c/o 2011 and I am embarrassed by some of my peers.  Namely the obnoxious ones who have taken this whole situation to extreme levels. Fortunately, they are only a small percentage of our graduating class. The vast majority of our class are respectable intelligent professionals. I have faith that cooler heads will prevail and we will make the best of graduation.
I had been resigned to remain silent during this entire sordid ordeal – which has been blown out of ridiculous proportions I might add – but after witnessing the extensive strain and anxiety that this episode has inflicted on a friend of mine (one that some of you heated commentators have been quick to condemn as “anti-Semitic”), I had to have a word in.
      Many individuals have neglected to acknowledge how this entire situation came about, which can really be boiled down to one, solitary word: favoritism.   You do not get to display partiality toward one group over other equally valid ones.  A higher learning institution should be not permitted to unfairly cater to the needs of one specific cultural sect, regardless of race, religion, social standing, orientation, or gender.  Rather than focusing on this basic precept, a vast number of students have drawn their attention to hyper-sensitive, religious component of the story, which, though unarguably relevant, should not be placed at the forefront of the issue.  What started out a simple matter of group bias has become perverted into a religious mêlée, resulting in a series of vicious character assaults against a group of well intentioned students.  What strikes me as the most ludicrous component of this entire business is the fact that those students who are using the most caustic rhetoric are justifying their slanderous comments upon a Facebook conversation.  Yes, Facebook; the same site where you can raise an imaginary farm or pretend to hurl barn yard animals at your friends.  The entire conversation (though unquestionably ill-timed) was entirely harmless, entailing the translation of certain naughty expressions into a different language.  If I were to ask a Russian friend how to say “I want to spank your mother’s bottom” in their native tongue would that then make me anti-Russian?  Of course not, but since the language happened to have been in Yiddish (and in view of the religious affiliation of the group in question) the dialog was grossly taken out of context and labeled anti-Semitic.  Using a word like “anti-Semitic” is not only injurious a person’s social standings and vocational prospects, it also demonstrates that you do not possess the capacity to form a rational argument.  It’s like drawing a comparison between the president and Hitler.  To those individuals that continue to employ such vindictive rhetoric I say you: STOP sidetracking the main issue, STOP slandering others with groundless accusations, and above all, STOP wasting everyone’s time.
it’s interesting how it is enough when someone who posts pictures of jewish faculty on facebook blaming them for ruining graduation gets called out, but it isn’t enough when comments are made about this change being about “jewish donors” and “jewish dollars.”  if i were you, i would choose my breaking point more wisely.
Interesting – you are very wise :)
I’m sorry that I have made unprofessional, irresponsible, and downright rude comments. The thing is that I am insecure about myself and how I fit into this world. I feel better when I tear other people down to make my hollow shell of an existence feel less empty. I am actually looking forward to graduation but I regret paying all this money for my education, you know how it is, it’s easier to leave angry than sad!
lol
Personally….I will not be looking forward to this class graduating and carrying our name on their diplomas.  They have come across as spoiled lil brats that have no sense of true identity.  Where do they get off thinking they need to be let in on executive decisions?  WHERE THE HELL DID YOU GET THAT IDEA?  Do these kids understand the administration gets paid to make decisions and does not rely on students to do their jobs?  Yes, it is a good leader who listens, but that does not mean they must bow-down to its subjects.  
Is this really about graduation?  Give me a break!  My family didn’t care where my ceremony was or what time it was and I am Jewish they were just proud of me that I accomplished something worth while.  My colleague hit it on a head, “Whine, Whine, Whine”. You are acting like children not getting what you want and you call this advocacy?  Even that fact your administration agreed to meet with you…THAT NEVER HAPPENS, so even if you disagree with them I applaud them for even giving you kids the time of day.  You’re lucky your administration even thought enough of changing the ceremony due to their sense of cultural sensitivity…where is yours?
The kid who thought it would be a great idea to speak Yiddish jokingly in an open forum in serious dialog with other students, AND who posted, apparently pictures of Jewish faculty and saying they were to blame for the change of venue….THIS KID NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS ACTIONS.  I would argue disciplinary action be taken.  I’m sure there must be some ethic code for such behavior…This kid wants to be a Social Worker?  What has happened to this class and where does this sense of entitlement come from?  It’s rather embarrassing for those of us that have graduated with a sense of true worth.  Did I mention we graduated at the Lyon Center?
I am sorry to admit that the acronym “University of Spoiled Children” really does apply with what I’m hearing here.  I am also proud of those who have taken a stance and have argued against this stupid dialog.  Where is USC getting some of these students?  Have they learned nothing about diplomacy or civility, let a lone as my colleague Marc states:
* Service
* Social justice
* Dignity and worth of the person
* Importance of human relationships
* Integrity
* Competence
This is not all your battle any longer kids just graduate on the lawn like everyone else does and let the class 2012 advocate for themselves.  Personally I believe you should be happy to be leaving if it is as bad as you say.  Why do you choose to convolute graduation with other topics at once, haven’t you learned that is not how advocacy works?
This is one I can get on board with!
You describe students that are upset with the change in graduation plans as having an overblown sense of entitlement. Is this any worse then imposing someone else’s religious taboos and practices upon ALL students just to accommodate your own? It is ironic you are advocating ALL affected students to “get over it” while the people who wish to observe the Shabbat be ENTITLED to do so as they always do. I do not want to repeat my earlier post about the inane compulsion some people still have about literal interpretations of scripture and using all technicalities imaginable to appear they are still abiding by the Almighty. (The fact we still have people in the 21st century who think God will be displeased if they attend their children’s graduation a few hours into the evening is pure comedy if not so tragically true). The only counter to this point is to reply how deeply offended you are by my rational statements. Whenever a religion is challenged, rationality can carry it only so far and it becomes time to play the victim and offended card. Your dismissive attitude towards those who object to having other people’s religious taboos imposed on them is a very telling sign if you are in a good position to judge self entitlement. 
Regarding the kid who was using Yiddish to make light of this incident and posting Jewish faculty photos – wouldn’t it be better to let the court of public opinion judge him? I am sure already there is regret now as those responsible have to face eternal consequences of having to explain those posts since we know the internet does not forget. You can lead a crusade to vilify and blacklist this student professionally but that would make you and those who pursue this avenue seem like a vindictive, humorless congregation – convinced you are entitled to be free of parody. We are not the Danish and whether it is through cartoons or language, I hope we do not become a society where we decide we must proverbially behead people who offend our ever growing delicate sensibilities – even if it does include caricaturing religion.
I am a member of the c/o 2011 and I am embarrassed by some of my peers. Namely the obnoxious ones who have taken this whole situation to extreme levels. Fortunately, they are only a small percentage of our graduating class. The vast majority of our class are respectable intelligent professionals. I have faith that cooler heads will prevail and we will make the best of graduation
It is truly disheartening to read all of these comments from educated and trained social workers that are supposed to walk in a spirit of empathy and respect. As a profession, to advocate is not merely what we do but who we are be it on a micro or macro level. Those that have voiced their concerns regarding the unilateral decision by the Administration to change graduation should not by any means be misconstrued as prejudicial or racist. As a matter of fact it is an attempt to refrain from being exclusionary toward our colleagues that many voice their opinions.
The Dean’s decision to change graduation to accommodate some cultures while not considering others’ defeats her so-called intent of “attempting” to be inclusive toward everyone. It is impossible to accommodate everyone with such rich cultural and religious traditions, however, it is possible to create choice and options and allow people to decide what is best for them. That is what it means to be inclusive!
The complaint is not so much about the venue but that choice was taken away. Had the graduates been given an opportunity to vote, the change would have been much easier to swallow rather than being force fed to take what was given. Like the civil rights, women’s suffrage and other equality movements, activists fought for options; to choose to sit anywhere on a bus or restaurant or to vote if they wanted to. The injustice was about taking away free choice (exclusion) and likewise, the student’s choices were taken away by the Dean.
The bottom line is that the Dean should have made no change! It was unnecessary and counterintuitive. Additionally, the Dean’s failure to be accountable for her decision until she was confronted shows her failure as a leader; if you are going to make a decision then don’t point fingers but own it from the outset!
The Dean has single-handedly by her blatant disregard for ALL students created a school that is divided culturally which is SHAMEFUL! Accusations are being made and lies are being told about our colleagues that would have never been uttered. Many of us have spent the last 2-3 years learning and growing together and have created friendships that have now been tarnished. Danny Hang may be somewhat obnoxious and extreme but an anti-Semite he is NOT! If you knew him you would know that without question. I have personally disagreed and engaged in debate with him but despite our differences I respect him because he has heart and is not afraid to speak out and confront issues which should be commended, not stifled and is what leadership is about!
To disagree is fine but to attack one’s character is NOT what we as social workers are about! I implore every student in our program to please cease with the hateful discourse and really assess the situation for what it is. This is not about one student or culture against another but really about the Administration’s mishandling of graduation and we cannot lose sight of that no matter who decided to speak out about it. If we as a graduating class, program and school cannot do that, then none of us deserve to walk on May 13th or put MSW behind our names!
USC, as a secular institution of higher learning needs to take a stance on this issue as well. Will all future ceremonies for all Schools need to make sure it does not conflict with the Shabbat? Surely no other Dean will want to go through this tumultuous ordeal so should we now expect blackout dates/times for religious observance? Will USC produce an official list of these blackout dates or will it be a tacit agreement, something quietly whispered outside the confines of transparent policy? So much in our society already bends over backwards in deference to religion and its respective patriarch, God, Jesus, Jehovah, Allah, Yahweh, Zeus, Neptune… and I am afraid USC  is falling right into the hands of those eagerly wielding the “I am offended…” card. These are the same people eagerly willing to throw around terms like Antisemitism, Islamophobia and Jain-haters. (OK I made up that last one). What is serious however, is if you throw about these labels to someone in our hyper, politically correct society today, even if the accusation is totally false, much of the shrapnel from the accusation alone will embed itself into the personal and professional flesh of the person willing to stand up for his or her opinion. The accusers know this and that is why they are so gleefully waiting for a juicy opportunity to be offended – real or imaginary. BTW, for all those who have to pay others to do work, such as even turning lights on and off on the official days of rest – isn’t it a bit silly you have to get the Almighty on a technicality? Furthermore, would your God be so unreasonable he can not understand you need to attend a graduation ceremony after years of hard work educating yourself? Are we really still such superstitious natives cowering the wrath of the fiery volcano lest it needs another virgin? Is your god really this douchey? If USC (and the US I dare say) is too afraid to stand up and be a true institute of higher learning, then perhaps it needs to step aside and allow other universities (say, in China) lead the charge in fields such as stem cell research while we are still beholden to our superstitious taboos. If USC existed during the days of Galileo, perhaps our school would have been filled with professors, alumni and students who would be offended at the effrontery of claiming the earth revolved around the sun. When it comes to standing up against religion, how little we have come since those days ..
Where is the consistency? All of these official events put on by the University and the School of Social Work, including Community Immersion, have taken place on a Saturday… Just a lil FYI, the school has had official events held on a Saturday, where they did not take into account the observance of Shabbat…

Well said…
Like the old saying goes “never mix religion and politics” into a conversation (and decision making).
The only fair thing to do is move it back to the original time since this had already been decided (right?).  Then next year have it at an earlier time.   Alternate the times so that no one religious group appears to get preferential treatment.  To give one group an appearance of preference will definitely cause anamosity every year.
Sure some groups will be offended but life is all about challenges and compromise.  An individual’s character is built upon challenges they encounter and compromises they make.
Who will man-up and say “we understand and we are willing to compromise and we will look forward to next year for our group.”
“Sure some groups will be offended but life is all about challenges and compromise. An individual’s character is built upon challenges they encounter and compromises they make.”
I find this ironic.
But I reply with this:
I understand and I am willing to compromise – C/O 2011 – 2pm graduation on Howard Jones. We’ll make it awesome!
“Striving to Strengthen, Empower and Inspire”
Lets hold ourselves to it.
Who do I sound like?
“Waahhh! Waahhh!  Mommy, you told me that you were going to take me to Chucky Cheese’s!!”
Mom: “I am sorry son.  We cannot go because life happens.”
“Wahhh! Wahh!  But you promised!!!”
I am a Trojan from a different department.  In our department, the administrators are paid to make the difficult decisions.  And we can either like them or dislike them but they have the final say.  You are complaining that you don’t have a voice?  Give me a break.  Were you raised in a cave?  (Apologies go out to the cavemen out there.)  That is how it works.  Executives are there to make the ”executive” decisions.  
I have a good friend who is an alumni of the School of Social work and she says that there are monthly “lunch with the deans” where students can voice their concerns.  That is unheard of.  We do not have such an arena to complain to administrators.  Have you attended these meetings?  If we don’t like the dean’s decisions, we can suck it up and stay, or just leave.  There are probably hundreds of students who would love to fill your spot.  
Be resilient and get over it!  Move on and enjoy the celebration at graduation.
Stop your complaining!  Knock it off already!! Stop acting like immature children!!
Stop embarrassing yourselves and most importantly stop embarrassing USC with your childish whining!!
For my graduation, we are also under a tent.  The location does not matter to me at all.  I am just happy to share and celebrate with my family my accomplishments.  The past several years, I have worked hard and consequently ignored my friends and family because of the overwhelming school work.  Yet they supported me and graduation is the time for me say thanks.  I know my grandparents would show up even if it was held outside with no tent.  
Stay classy “social workers”!!!
And DT, how is this news worthy?
And what department are you from?
I think you point to an interesting practice at the school of social work, that the school is a top-down organization, but it is managed in a way that encourages the opposite. The organizational context does not support a bottom-up approach and so conflict and friction occurs when students who think that they are stakeholders in this process are stymied. This is further complicated when these students do not acknowledge the point that further protest, especially as it is being done here, is counterproductive to their cause.
Also you are right that any other department would probably suck it up and move on. But your interpretation that we are immature children is inaccurate and I hope you consider the following. One strength of the social work education is that we are trained to advocate for what we believe in, and that is reflected in our rich history of social change and support of progressive movements. What you are seeing now are beginning professional social workers who are living up to this tradition, albeit in a misguided way.
Well, as we are all entitled to our own opinion, here is mine. Here’s the whole story from my point of view… I saw what went down on facebook and some of the comments posted in reference to the individual quoted in this article. Speaking as a Jewish student, I did not take offense to any of it. I did not see any of it in a mean spirited or hateful kind of way, but I can certainly see how it might have been taken out of context. 
From what I read, another student posted a Yiddish insult comment on the student org. group page. The student who posted this, who I know is Jewish, seemed to have meant it as a joke to help make light of the whole crazy graduation debacle. The student quoted in this article, who I feel might even know the student who posted the initial Yiddish insult comment, responded back to the other student with an ‘OMG, lol.’ He then preceeded again by adding another Yiddish quip. The student who posted the original Yiddish post responded with another Yiddish phrase. Some people were upset by this and posted their thoughts. The original poster even posted an ‘Oy Vey,’ and to me, it seemed to say almost lighten up people, it was meant to be funny and not so serious. 
Some people reading this took this to be offensive and voiced their concerns. One individual even posted both of their names and said to ‘cut it out!’ At which point, the original poster had deleted her all of her Yiddish quips posts, leaving all of the Yiddish quips by the person quoted in his article to stand alone. To some reading that, it might have seemed offensive, but when you looked at it in its entirety, which I did, it did not. That’s certainly not to say that it was not the correct forum for both students to banter back and forth on, it might have been inappropriate.
Some people on this site are calling out the student quoted in this article saying that he’s spewing hateful words and what not, when they did not see the whole situation in its entirety. I can see how some might see what he posted as being hateful and mean spirited when his comments stood alone, which it did for some time until it was removed. If he’s taking heat, people also might want to look calling out the student who posted the original remarks, to which he responded to… I just wanted to get this out there for all to see.
Throwing around the word hate and anti-semetic are very dangerous, especially when you don’t look at the entire picture. We must remember that on facebook, words and be taken out of context and misconstrued, as educated people, we must remember to look at the entire picture.
Both students should not have used the student org. forum to post their comments, it was inappropriate. But speaking as a Jewish student, I did not see it as offensive or anti-semetic at all.
We must be very careful before we throw the words hate and anti-semetic around.
i saw this “yiddish conversation” unfold from the beginning, and i do know that the original poster is jewish – doesn’t matter.  it was still completely inappropriate for both of them to engage in such banter – especially in light of the other posts the student quoted in this article has made.  he DID post pictures of jewish faculty members on his page, telling people that this was who they could blame for the venue change.  that in and of itself warrants this student being called out as an antisemite and calling for disciplinary action against him.  the other stuff just adds to it.
If that was the case, his page would have been blown up with comments? Word would have gotten around, no? Judging from his posts on this page, he seems to only be fairly advocating, at least in my opinion. I guess when you’re in the ‘spotlight’, it’s fair game to be attacked on all ends, regardless of points of views… 
I bet now he knows what it might feel like to be a politician. But I don’t think he is spewing hate, nor do I think he’s anti-semitic. If you think he’s hateful (which I certainly don’t), and instead of you calling him hateful and an anti-semitic, why don’t you engage in personal dialogue with him and explain your point of view. Perhaps he doesn’t realize his actions can be interpreted in manners for which he did not intend to. 
As a social worker, maybe you can help convey your point of view with him and help him understand where you are coming from? That will certainly help him understand and correct his actions, won’t it? Isn’t that what we are taught and trained to do? Isn’t that the basis of our duty and profession? I’m just saying… 
At this point, let’s all work together and help one another understand differences. If I can get anything out of this whole debacle, I want to learn more about the Muslim faith.
“If that was the case, his page would have been blown up with comments? Word would have gotten around, no?”
No, because he deleted it.
That is an accurate blow-by-blow. Many people saw the full exchange, and some have screenshots of it. However, your comfort with it as a Jew doesn’t make it ok, nor does the other person’s participation as a Jew, if that is the case, make it ok. Many other students, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, found the exchange mocking and antisemetic in tone, and completely inappropriate, particularly coming from a person raising hell over changing the graduation ceremony in response to Jewish concerns.
Yes, I agree with you. I think this is a lesson for both students. I don’t think he or she meant any harm. And I don’t think he raised hell over the graduation, he along with many other students are advocating. Just so happens that out of all the pictures taken by the Daily Trojan (because I attended both meetings and also spoke to the Daily Trojan reporter), they used his…
Seems as if they felt bad about offending people, they would have apologized to the people they offended.
Do Jews ever get tired of getting offended at the drop of a hat? Is it possible to simple disagree with someone who is Jewish and not be called an Anitsemite?
Exactly.
Dump the old bag.
She’s a Zionist puppet.
Simple solution…move graduation to the following Monday
Or Thursday the night before?
Or maybe she is culturally competent and tries to consider our students and faculty? The USC School of Social Work works with Hebrew Union, there are students that are perusing joint degrees.
Shame on those students who have spewed hatred by posting comments on facebook that are not only threatening and comparing a modern day humanitarian crisis to a graduation event? Are you flippin’ kidding me! Come on guys! 
 True SOCIAL WORKERS adhere to the NASW Code of Ethics which states the following:
The mission of the social work profession is rooted in a set of core values. These core values, embraced by social workers throughout the profession’s history, are the foundation of social work’s unique purpose and perspective:
    * service
    * social justice
    * dignity and worth of the person
    * importance of human relationships
    * integrity
    * competence.
The Daily Trojan should also look into covering important  accomplishments that the School of Social Work has done in the past and the present. Those students who were quoted were obviously spewing/ projecting a lot of anger before clearly thinking how they were going to be seen by classmates, peers and future employers!
It’s sad, but in the end, they make social workers look bad and add-on to our already tarnished image by the media. So a big thank you to those students who are now the embarrassment of the School of Social Work. Clearly I will be making sure that my colleagues in the field keep an eye out for these soon to be graduates who posses little conflict resolution skills and act like spoiled children. In all, I hope my beloved Graduate Alma Matter’s administration will handle this situation before future employers begin to stereotype our graduates as children who are worthy to call themselves social workers.
Marc class of ’97
Dear Marc,
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Marc, The article did not do justice to the volume of the concerns that were brought up by students. Many students are upset because the administration has failed to exemplify or follow the values in the NASW Code of Ethics!!!! I believe the USC School of Social work currently differs from when you were a student. Much of the problem stems from the over admittance of students. Our graduating class has 400 STUDENTS!!!!! The administration admitted these students but were not adequately equipped to do so. Internships were underdeveloped, there has been a shortage of faculty, issues as simple as classrooms have even become an issue. I would like to point out that many first year students did not even have internships at all until months after the semester began. 
It is upsetting that you, a social worker, would stereotype the student who are upset with the change in graduation as “spoiled children”. I am a first generation student from a low socioeconomic background. I have struggled tremendously due to my decision to attend this university due to the high tuition. However, I made this decision because the Social Work program is ranked top 10 in the nation. As a stakeholder/student I am disappointed with the School of Social Work. This disappointment expands beyond the issue of graduation.
The administration continues to make decisions with out considering the voice of students. As an alumni – I completely understand your defense of the program however, it is not students that are tarnishing the reputation of the School of Social Work but rather the leadership (administrators) of the program. Hopefully, the School of Social Work reverts back to providing the services that the graduating class of ’97 was fortunate to receive.
I could be wrong, but it doesn’t seem like Marc was referring to students who were simply upset with the venue change as spoiled children….  But rather he seemed to be singling out the students who were comparing our graduation event to a modern day humanitarian crisis, comparing Dean Flynn to infamous dictators, etc etc – as acting like spoiled children. 
There are ways we can advocate for change, use conflict resolution skills, and still stick to our values. Throwing a hate filled tantrum is not one of them.
Unknown Trojan- Thank you for your clarification. However, please do not assume that those who are upset with the venue change do not have a valid right to do so. These student cannot be stereotyped as “spoiled children” either. There are valid points underlying the frustrations with the venue change. Although, the Dean has stated that students can invite as many guests as they want and that tickets are unlimited.-the old venue can hold a significantly larger amount of guests. Also even on the surface level students were promised the Shrine. The new venue as the dean has stated was not previously chosen “because it is not air-conditioned, the sound is not particularly good, and it is simply less attractive from a ceremonial point of view”. Although the prestige of the ceremony may not matter to some- for others it may. It is not fair to devalue the opinions of these students by labeling them as “spoiled children”.
Students who are upset with the venue change or how the whole situation was handled have the right to be upset. No one is saying they aren’t allowed to be upset.
However, those students who are resorting to hate, anti-semetism, name-calling, etc – they’re the ones who people are calling out as “spoiled children.”
Marc,
Your professional threat towards these new graduates which you are intent on having your colleagues “keep an eye out for…” is pathetic and what is actually damaging to the profession of Social Workers. If you disagree with the position of certain people you are going to extend that vendetta and see that these dissenters pay in the future? Seems these personal, childish vendettas tarnish the profession of Social Work more then a zealous pursuit to expression a certain position one chooses to have. Your weak argument that their FB page is all you need to know about their judgement in the future is such a cowardly reaction to your little temper tantrum. Shame on you.
Please do not become a social worker.  Perhaps another profession would suit you better.  One in a boxing ring perhaps?  We have no need for people like you in our profession.  Please reconsider your choice of profession.  I hear no compassion, but patronizing and condescending remarks in order for your word to be heard.
Wow, so how are the hypocritical, ad hominem attacks working for you? I imagine I am being as compassionate, patronizing and condescending with my comments as you would be if someone wanted the graduation ceremony to start at the crack of dawn because it would please their god of choice, Apollo. They would have as much evidence as the evidence for observing the Shabbat. 
Look, I do not care if you believe observing the Shabbat is important. I do care you are imposing your need to practice this to the detriment of others.
You hate Jews. We get it.
Tommy,
Actually, I find ALL religions laughable so if you are Jewish, stop feeling so special but that is neither here nor there…the issue here is why a dean of  our secular university are making important decisions affecting many students based on the consecrated praxis of a single group.
Actually – i’m an atheist.
Tommy,
Then do you come from super liberal parents that beat into your head about being super hyper politically correct to the point you can not formulate opinions if it appears to be critical of any group? Wow – you are so typical LA…
Shame on the Daily Trojan.  Not only was this reporter drawn out to the event by an overzealous hater, but then Cueva failed to acknowledge other sides of this debacle.  All of the students quoted and interviewed were the “squeakiest wheels” — I’m sure she didn’t bother to find other students to talk to. What about the numerous students who don’t feel this change is an “injustice”? And, as another poster has mentioned, one quoted student in particular, as well as others sadly, have been posting hateful messages on Facebook.  Not only do these students misrepresent the student body, but lazy reporting has misrepresented the full story.  Where’s the Daily Trojan at more meaningful — and newsworthy — School of Social Work events?  When year after year it sends the largest contingent of social workers to the State Capitol to advocate for the vulnerable and underserved?  When students held a marriage equality rally that featured the mayor of West Hollywood?  When it unveiled a first-of-its-kind virtual tool to train students to address the mental health needs of returning soldiers?  But maybe I’m asking too much.  Maybe the Daily Trojan wants to go the way of other media outlets, “reporting” only on what’s most sensational, and content with quasi-facts.  What’s next, Lindsay Lohan on the front page?
Yes! Thank you!
The voices of reason are starting to emerge!
WOW!!! Looks like the daily trojan really got this one right (that some students are upset)
   -unlike the article about outrage over a stupid venue change for orientation from ground zero to the new cc
I’ve never seen more comments (or even such long comments) on a post before.
As for this issue, just figure out which time affects more students. Either way some students will miss out/have to make a choice. If more ppl cant go to the earlier time b/c of other graduation ceremonies/muslim observances….move it back to 6, if more ppl cant make 6 b/c of shabbat, keep it as is.
This is in no way against any group, and I think the fact that it changed from 6 to 2 to accomidate religious students is totally acceptable, and was surprised to read that there was outrage over the fact that it was to accommodate jewish students, rather than over the venue change. (outrage over the principle rather than practicality) as it reads:
“Students said they are not as upset about the change in venue or time as they are about the lack of equality for all students at a secular institution.”
b/c this change was clearly TRYING to promote equality so that ppl wouldn’t miss out, NOT the other way around.

I dont think it’s necessary to be rude or insensitive to any religion or culture. We are social workers and we must remember to be culturally sensitive and advocate in a professional manner. I agree that the dean and administration handled this situation very inappropriately. We all  deserve an apology and we all deserve a memorable graduation ceremony.    Let’s be respectful of one another and work together not against each other.
Exactly!
I agree 100%!
It’s helpful to consider the source here. The gentleman fomenting this little rebellion, Danny Hang, has been caught on Facebook posting pictures of Jewish faculty and accusing them of ruining graduation (faculty who, ironically, don’t even observe Shabbat, but were painted with his hate brush nevertheless because they are Jewish), and enjoying a little mockery of Jews in Yiddish. All of which posts he has since removed, under pressure from peers who will not be associated with, or tolerate, such anti-Semitism.  
Muslim students and students of other spiritual and religious backgrounds should all make their voices heard, and have the right to do so. Furthermore, if the school does not provide that opportunity during its upcoming meeting with students, and respond to their concerns, then that is failing on the school’s part, and all students should be upset with the school about that. Laying the blame for the administration’s actions at the feet of Jews, who merely advocated successfully for themselves, is unacceptable. Just as it would be unacceptable if the situation were different, and the ceremony had been scheduled for Sunday morning, and Christians had been up in arms. Let’s try to keep arguments rational and objective, and devoid of blanket statements and other subtle signs of prejudice.
Absolutely, thank you! I’ve been so put off by some of our peers reactions to the change in graduation. Please keep it classy folks!
Thank you “Consider the source” for pointing this out.  I hope he faces disciplinary action for the hate he has spewed.
Deleting one’s comments does not make them go away. People should be held accountable. That’s what screenshots are for.
Even without screenshots or testimony, comments are always there on the FB server too.
While everyone is certainly entitled to their own opinion, publicly stating someone’s name and falsely accusing them of things that are not true is unfortunate. This “little rebellion” that you speak of is a collective of students who are coming together to advocate for themselves ultimately to address the pattern of Dean Flynn making decisions without anyone’s input.
The student who you mention above is one of many students who are coming together to address concerns and never to demean anyone’s religion. 
Students are voicing their concerns about the handling of the change. Also, aside from the graduation change, there are numerous issues that have not been addressed by administration. Advocacy should not be berated or belittled. No one is trying to devalue your opinion but falsifying statements and making assumptions about people’s intentions is unnecessary.
I hear that your upset and understand being rational and objective but if that is the case and you obviously know the person stated above, you could have just had a dialogue with him.
Actually, the things stated about this student ARE true.  The administration is aware of and has seen his blatantly antisemitic comments/postings, as have dozens of other students.  There is no hiding from this.  Taking them down does not mean they never happened.  Having such a person at the forefront of your movement seriously ruins your credibility.  One cannot have a dialogue with hate.
I agree with “actually.”
The student in question has been obnoxious. Having him as a leader of your movement  taints what you’re trying to do and the message you’re trying to send.
Who said he is the leader of our movement? Because the daily trojan highlighted his comments, please do not make assumptions. 
As I said before, students are coming together collectively with a common goal to address administration effectively. Please do not devalue the hard work that is being to voice student concerns. Assumptions about what we are meeting for is wrong. Also, do not make assumptions and state that our dialogue is filled with hate, it is far from that.
It is truly disheartening to read all of these comments from educated and trained social workers that are supposed to walk in a spirit of empathy and respect. As a profession, to advocate is not merely what we do but who we are be it on a micro or macro level. Those that have voiced their concerns regarding the unilateral decision by the Administration to change graduation should not by any means be misconstrued as prejudicial or racist. As a matter of fact it is an attempt to refrain from being exclusionary toward our colleagues that many voice their opinions. 
The Dean’s decision to change graduation to accommodate some cultures while not considering others’ defeats her so-called intent of “attempting” to be inclusive toward everyone. It is impossible to accommodate everyone with such rich cultural and religious traditions, however, it is possible to create choice and options and allow people to decide what is best for them. That is what it means to be inclusive! 
The complaint is not so much about the venue but that choice was taken away. Had the graduates been given an opportunity to vote, the change would have been much easier to swallow rather than being force fed to take what was given. Like the civil rights, women’s suffrage and other equality movements, activists fought for options; to choose to sit anywhere on a bus or restaurant or to vote if they wanted to. The injustice was about taking away free choice (exclusion) and likewise, the student’s choices were taken away by the Dean. 
The bottom line is that the Dean should have made no change! It was unnecessary and counterintuitive. Additionally, the Dean’s failure to be accountable for her decision until she was confronted shows her failure as a leader; if you are going to make a decision then don’t point fingers but own it from the outset! 
The Dean has single-handedly by her blatant disregard for ALL students created a school that is divided culturally which is SHAMEFUL! Accusations are being made and lies are being told about our colleagues that would have never been uttered. Many of us have spent the last 2-3 years learning and growing together and have created friendships that have now been tarnished. Danny Hang may be somewhat obnoxious and extreme but an anti-Semite he is NOT! If you knew him you would know that without question. I have personally disagreed and engaged in debate with him but despite our differences I respect him because he has heart and is not afraid to speak out and confront issues which should be commended, not stifled and is what leadership is about!
To disagree is fine but to attack one’s character is NOT what we as social workers are about! I implore every student in our program to please cease with the hateful discourse and really assess the situation for what it is. This is not about one student or culture against another but really about the Administration’s mishandling of graduation and we cannot lose sight of that no matter who decided to speak out about it. If we as a graduating class, program and school cannot do that, then none of us deserve to walk on May 13th or put MSW behind our names!
I see no problem stating that one Danny Hang, mentioned in this article, publicly posted pictures of all the Jewish faculty members in the School of Social Work, without their permission, and accused them on Facebook of “ruining” his graduation. That’s exactly what he did, I have seen it and numerous faculty members have seen it, and there is no “false accusation” there. The fact that he has deleted them does not in any way erase those acts, especially on the internet when these things are so easily accessible.
If a Muslim student truly can not participate in our graduation ceremony due to the prayer service than USC must address this! I hope that the Muslim student body brings this to Dean Flynn’s attention.
I wholeheartedly agree with you. But I think the issue lies in the student body of Muslim as well as other religious minority representation within the confines of faculty and staff. I applaud the Jewish community for being able to come together and rally for a change, that’s what it’s all about, and I respect that – Shabbat Shalom, Shalom Chaverim! L’chaim!
There are many Jewish students within our program and there are many Jewish faculty and staff within our program that can help to institute change and provide cultural learning and guidance on Jewish education and culture. Hell we even have a cross program with Hebrew Union College! 
That is not the case for underrepresented minorities like that of the Muslim community within the School of Social Work. I see a lot of Jewish professors and staff members, and I am very proud of that. In fact, I have had many Jewish professors at USC (mostly all of my professors) that have been amazing, as they have helped taught me some Jewish cultures and traditions that I did not know before. And I am happy they did that, as being a social worker I enjoy learning about different cultures and religions not my own. One professor even invited me to a celebrate a Passover Seder with their family, and I am grateful they did, teh food was amazing and I learned a lot! Heck, we even have the Skirball Center, and that is great! Jewish students can certainly look to Jewish professors and staff for any cultural guidance as well as learning.
As far as the Muslim student body is concerned, there aren’t many, and they are clearly in the minority. Hell, they weren’t even considered and thought of when the graduation ceremony was changed. THAT ANGERS ME as I have many Muslim family members (converted) and friends. We don’t see many faculty and or staff members within the school who reflect the Muslim community that can help advocate for minorities such a Muslim students. If that was the case, then the school, and when I say school, I mean Dean Flynn, then considerations other than as well as in addition to the Judaism faith would have taken place. Instead a unilateral decision was made in a horrific way and mistakenly leaked out to everyone. The same goes for Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Zoroastrian, and many other beliefs and faiths around the globe. I think that is a shame.
In the Daily Trojan article, Dean Flynn as a dictator, WHO CAN BE COMPARED TO THE LIKES OF: Castro/Gadaffi/Kim-Jung-Il/Moubarak/Tito/Stalin, stated that the School of Social Work was very diverse.  SHE LIED TO COVER HER ASS AND SAVE FACE! The school is not as diverse as the school certainly advertises to the community and incoming students. Personally, I think herein lies the problem, and this is part of the reason we are in this graduation debacle in the first place.
Equality for all religions is a must. Especially since USC is a secular institution. No particular should be given preference over others.
“Dean Flynn as dictator, WHO CAN BE COMPARED TO THE LIKES OF: Castro/Gadaffi/Kim-Jung-Il/Moubarak/Tito/Stalin.”
Seriously? Wow, you’re a piece of work.
The vitriolic reaction from the student body regarding this graduation debacle is the result of a series of administrative and leadership failures by the school of social work. 
This includes the current graduation issue, poor planning of all school day (reserving a space too small to accommodate all students despite it being a mandatory event), admission of too many students without adequate professors and field study placements, and an outdated curriculum and myopic view of social work education that stifles creativity and fails to adequately prepare students for the professional world of social work.
While I do believe that the the education here is second to none in the LA area, it does not live up to the hype and promises. In my opinion, that is why students are angry: we did not receive what we were promised and this graduation event is a tipping point and a poignant example of what has been happening through the course of our graduate education.
Fight on.
Here-here!!
As alum, I have seen a drop in the quality of the program, the professors, the classes, and even the quality of some of the students they admit to the program has fallen. I am disappointed that the school has shifted so far from what it promised to many students, and can’t seem to find a balance between delivering quality education and placating the students. When people ask me if they should go to USC SSW, I say no- the school has started to make a whole lot of promises, paints a pretty picture on the outside, but fails to deliver. It’s embarrassing.
How can the school be #8 in the country, but fail the students? 
As for the graduation, I hope they can figure it out.
The question is does USC SSW observe these religious holidays? If yes, then the planning committee should have foreseen this holiday and planned around it before confirming the time, venue, and date for the ceremony.
However, if USC SSW does not observe religious holidays, it was unfair to change the graduation ceremony, especially without hearing from the students.
Speaking of hearing from the students, it makes me wonder what’s the point of having ‘Lunch with the Deans’ and surveys if they DON’T LISTEN.
The students’ concerns/complaints is an indicator to how the program is working. 
Yes there’s an administrative side to the program that the deans must adhere to, but dang, listen to the students who PAY ALL THAT DAMN MONEY !!
I have been reading this entire thread and I feel the above comment is much like how I feel. As a first year student, since I will not be attending this year’s graduation I haven’t become emotionally involved in the whole ordeal since it doesn’t affect my graduation plans (as of now)- however, I have first-hand experienced the poor planning of all school day, admission of too many students and not enough field placements, and outdated curriculums. THIS is why MOST people are upset, from what I see and hear. It’s just the straw that broke the camel’s back for the people who do not observe conflicting religious holidays(s) or need special accommodations for family members that would have been better served at the Shrine. Also, there was an earlier comment questioning the DT’s decision to publish an article about this ordeal, yet they really never do come around when the school of social work is doing some GOOD. shame on them.
Rebecca.trounson@Latimes.com…. Contact her with your opinions let our voices be heard.. And let’s put into action what the school of social work has taught us to ADVOCATE for what we belief in..!
If you are a Jewish student who observes Shabbat there is absolutely no way to attend the graduation ceremony, as every element of the ceremony  violates Shabbat. If you are a Muslim student who needs to pray at some point during the afternoon ceremony, one could hypothetically take out a mat, pray and then return to the graduation. There is a very big difference. It is incumbent upon the students to understand these nuances. This is a part of the cultural sensitivity education that USC obviously failed to provide. Any ranting about “Jewish money” is hyperbolic as there is no basis for these types of claims. When statements like these are made without any proof, I have to wonder about the inner thought process that leads a person to such radical conclusions.
How dare you reduce the Muslim Jumu’ah prayer to only praying on a mat!
The jumu’ah prayer (also known as jum’ah, Friday prayer, etc.) is a congregational prayer (salah) that Muslims hold every Friday is half the dhuhr prayer, for convenience, preceded by a khutbah (a sermon as a technical replacement of the two reduced rakaʿāt of the ordinary dhuhr prayer), and followed by a communal prayer, led by the imam. This is usually held at a Mosque where an Imam is present.
This isn’t just any daily prayer, this is a Friday Congregational prayer at a Mosque. THAT IS THE BIG DIFFERENCE! I think you should also read up and learn more about these cultural nuances.
The “Cultural sensitivity” you seem to value so dearly is what allows female genitals to be mutilated around the world – all in deference towards “respecting” retarded cultures retarded practices. What If I believed my daughters were witches that brought me a bad crop – would you respect my desire to burn them?
Wow…if you are trying to make a point you have loss all my respect.
OMG, Ras – please please please tell me you were trying to be funny? If not, please please tell me that you wrote this while high on something that caused poor judgement and some sort of thought disorder.  Your statement is ridiculous.
There is a HUGE difference between advocating for cultural competence, respect, and tolerance vs. advocating for human right violations.
I am glad the Dean is holding a Town Hall to communicate with students. However, prior to being contacted by the Daily Trojan we were informed that she would not be available to meet with students until March 10th. Also prior to be contacted by the Daily Trojan the Dean had not responded to any emails sent to her by students voicing their concerns and now she states that she is willing to meet with any student who is inconvenienced individually? All of the sudden she is willing to free her calendar? It seems that she is finally receiving pressure from the students and other entities to face the consequences of her abrupt decision. The administration has made decisions like this time and again since I have been a MSW student.
Also, to the post stating that most students are upset because a graduation under a tent is less desirable. Although, some schools hold their ceremonies outside schools also hold their graudation at the Galen center as well as the Shrine. Also because the Dean made this decision so close to graduation-Howard Jones Field was the only venue open. One can assume this is because no other school wanted this venue at this time. Students are stakeholders of this institution and have the right to state their opinions. I am growing tired of people throwing the teachings of the social work profession in the face of those who would like a nice ceremony. The administration is not setting a good example for student and is also violating many of the values in the social work code of ethics.
For me this issue expands beyond graduation. As a stakeholder/customer I have not received what I have paid for. The USC School of Social Work is ranked as a top 8 in the nation however; they are not living up to this standard. I am very disappointed in my decision to attend this program besides the connections that I have made with other MSW students. I also want to commend students for advocating. As the c/o 2012 MSW student stated above this will also help them in the future.
How do we send this link to every social work school in southern california?????? Can someone attempt to work on this? Everyone needs to know that the facade of the USC School of Social Work is a bunch of bologne! This article sums up some of the reality.
Flynn abrupt decision goes against everything the school of social has taught us students.. She’s has taken away our voices.. I used to be proud to say I attended USC now I am disgusted with USC especially Dean Flynn who does not taken the students into consideration..! She sided with Jewish professors who have been at USC for many years and decided to change the ceremony without even asking the students.. Flynn was wrong to make special accommodations for one the Jewish community becuz now she will not make those same accomadations for the muslim community.. USC is all about the money(Jewish donors) not about the students..!
Contact Rebecca.trounson@Latimes.com she wants to hear what has really been going on at USC
Frankly, I think the graduation ceremony should have gone as planned. I’m not a Religious Studies major or anything but Shabbat is held EVERY SINGLE Friday, a Masters graduation ceremony may be that “Once in a life time” event. The graduation planning process does not need to take on a religious agenda, this isn’t Fuller or Pepperdine. This “decision” made by Flynn is unfair as it accomodates a handful of people but NEGATIVELY affects hundreds of others! I’m an alumni, w/a sibling participating in this graduation ceremony and I am bothered at the change and this consideration to a religious event AND at the way Flynn has gravely mishandled the situation. I have a feeling she does’nt in fact come from a Social Work background, explains A LOT!
Is there a connection with major USC  contributors and donors and this obvious pandering to the Jewish community? Perhaps there are external and internal pressures paced on Dean Flynn and she is not strong enough to stand up for what she really desired and just simply caved. If you just walk around campus and see names on placards on benches, gates, buildings, etc can you take a guess if those major contributors are Jewish? I suppose if I ran an institution that readily receives a lot of money from a certain group, I too would pander to them and forfeit the considerations of other groups who may not be as substantial in their donations. What Dean Flynn did I am sure pleased everyone from the School of Social Work to all the heads of the University. This cold splash of reality is fitting for a graduation ceremony that will finally thrust the students out into the real world. BTW, I am eager to hear the first person gasp and use “I am deeply offended…” argument as a counterpoint to my post. I would also not be surprised to read responses that even accuse me of being Anti Semitic even though I have NOT said anything negative about the Jewish Community. In our retarded, hyper politically correct society people are quick and eager to be offended about most anything. Now people are going to sidetrack this topic and say they were offended I used the word “retarded”…wow – this is really hard to have a candid, honest conversation anymore.
I am EXTREMELY disappointed in USC School of Social Work. I am a 3 year part-time graduating student and have seen this institution’s integrity to students dissipate and now with this change, I feel utterly ignored and disrespected. Dean Flynn and all of Administration need to reflect on how quickly the school of social work is losing its reputation and now being seen as a “brand” instead of an honorable academic institution….
For a school that is leading the Nation in military research and diversity, I find it very ironic, disrespectful and hypocritical that there is a lack of uniformity when Shabbat is (honored) recognized and Veterans Day is not a holiday that is observed (meaning students still must go to internship or class).
Most of the schools/programs at SC are having ceremonies outside on fields and under tents. Our ceremony, like theirs, will turn out just fine.
I commend the School of Social Work for taking Shabbat into consideration. I think it is unfortunate how the whole situation was handled (via a misdirected e-mail).
The article states,”Students said they are not as upset about the change in venue or time as they are about the lack of equality for all students at a secular institution.”
I think this (the secular institution argument) represents the opinion of only a handful of angry students. I have heard that most students are upset at the way the situation was handled and/or that we have “downgraded” from the Shrine to what sounds like a less than desirable tent.
Hello, I was the one quoted in the article with regards to the “secular” comment. I did say that, but I also did mention a whole slew of other arguments as well, including what you mentioned about “the way the situation was handled.” I just wanted to be clear on that point. The writter of the article slanted the article towards religious beliefs but failed to bring up other points. She actually interviewed the person I will be referencing below.
And yes, I do commend the school for taking into consideration the Shabbat, as we should be sensitive to beliefs and cultures not of our very own. If we follow that logic, which we all should as social workers, why wasn’t the Muslim observance of the Jumu’ah also taken into consideration? Jumu’ah is the (Muslim Friday prayer, etc.) is a congregational prayer (salah) that Muslims hold every Friday, just after noon in lieu of dhuhr. Jumu’ah occurs EVERY FRIDAY, just like how the Shabbat occurs EVERY SATURDAY. In situations like this, picking one over another is not healthy and not good for anybody. Look at the divide that this has created?
One individual of Muslim belief expressed during the graduation committee meeting last Thursday that their parents and grandparents would not be able to attend the graduation ceremony due to the Jumu’ah prayer. Is it right that this individual’s religious needs are not met by the school but other religious beliefs are met? Is this person’s religious beliefs not as important or come secondary to another’s faith?
You should really ask yourself about that and then try and come up with a good alternative that you might want to share with Dean Flynn.
I was at the meeting when the Muslim student expressed that her family would not be able to come because of the 12-2 prayer time.  But I was also there when Hillary Chisum asked if pushing the start time of the ceremony back would be beneficial to give them time to get to USC.  That student said NO, that she had family coming from several countries.  What??  What does that have to do with religious observance?  It was clear that this student was concerned with number of allowed tickets and not with accommodating every group’s observances.  If you are going to tell the story, tell the WHOLE story.
Danny thank you for your excellent comment. I believe the point is when accomidating one group another may be excluded. Many who are upset with the MSW students for speaking up and accusing them of being culturally insensitive. Students have the right to advocate. Please do not be quick to assume that these students are lacking in the area of cultural sensitivity!!!!!!!
    I was also at the meeting and to the comment of telling the whole story. I do not believe it is fair for you to assume that “it was clear that the student this student was concerned with the number of-allowed tickets and not with accomidating every group’s observences”. How did you come to this conclusion? Did you ask the student personally? Making assumptions is adding to the divide amongst students.
OK, well… First of all, the prayer service is not like a 10 or 15 minute service. It may last a while, maybe even up to 2 or 3 hours depending on the sermon given by the Imam. The point is, it is an important day of prayer that only occurs once a week, similar to the observance of the Jewish Shabbat or even the Christian Sabbath. Muslims hold Friday in a special and high regard, please do not downplay that. Who are you to say? If the prayer service lasted 1 1/5 hours or maybe even 2 hours, or even more, that would still push the graduation ceremony to 4 or maybe even 5 o’clock, almost cutting into the Shabbat? 
Don’t assume just because that student didn’t further explain their specific reason, they weren’t telling their whole story. That student certainly does not need to explain to you.  Did the Jewish community explain to the rest of us? NO, they did not, in fact the administration explained for them via a leaked e-mail. But, besides the point, we as students, are understanding that the Shabbat is held in high regards to the Jewish faithful and we adhere to that. Most are upset at the process of how it happened. In addition, accommodations for certain beliefs should also warrant accommodations for others. 
That is the WHOLE STORY. Maybe you should try and open dialogue with the Muslim community and find out more before any assumptions are made? In fact, I think all of us can benefit from that. It might be a good learning experience and better help us to understand different faiths and beliefs. Whether you’re Muslin, Jewish, Christian, Buddhist, or hell even a Satanist. Ones beliefs are ones beliefs and as social workers we should all be accepting, tolerant, and accommodating to all.
LOL!
Congratulations MSW students graduating c/o 2011 for advocating for yourself and your class. Your advocacy will not only help your class and your graduation ceremony, but also those classes that follow you. Please make your voices heard during the meetings! 
Keep up the good work and fight on!!!
Not only do we, the students, want the Dean to apologize for the “abruptness of the change”, we also want her to apologize for consistently making decisions without involving students. Our tuition helps to pay administrator salaries. They work for students! It is NOT the other way around. And the thought of highly trained administrators making uninformed, biased and “abrupt” changes  that impacts hundreds of other students and their families call into question whether or not she should be in such a position. 
Thank you so much for publishing this article. Im glad our voices have been heard! Fight On!
It’s funny that she mentions that students are very involved in the graduation process when she also states that it was her decision. So basically students can be involved only when they go along with her wishes? Who is she without the students? Where are the NASW values and ethics in her statements? What does this say about the school of social work? I say the students should protest by excluding her and her administration from graduation ceremony. Have a student run graduation. You will still get your titles in the mail.
I think this is pretty damn ridiculous! As the article pointed out, USC is a secular institution. Yes, Shabbat is a very important day of observance, and I am proud that USC is taking that into sonsideration and had the ceremony moved for that reason out of respect. But on the other hand, so is the Muslim time and day of prayer which starts Friday afternoon. No one took that into consideration? The Dean needs to be held responsible for her discriminatory unilateral action.
This Dean sounds like a complete dictator. Especially with her quote, “This is my decision. This is how I decided to resolve the conflict as I understood it. Not everybody will agree with that, but that’s my perception and that’s my decision.” In thought Social Work was supposed to be about hearing the needs of people, advocacy, support, etc… She took that all away, she essentially took our voice. All of the tools that the social work program has instilled in its students are being taken away by this Dean.
In the old days, people like “Oliver Cromwell” would have simply solved this problem for all!

When Radiohead releases a new album, they don’t just release a new album.
As evidenced by the band’s previous two releases, Radiohead dominates music headlines with descriptions of their innovative forms of marketing and distribution. Whoever is behind the band’s PR work is a genius for his or her ability to generate so much buzz about the band’s work.
New Yorke · Radiohead’s new album, The King of Limbs, has tracks that seem best suited for a calm setting rather than a raucous, large arena. - Photo courtesy of Nasty Little Man  
We saw this in 2007, when Radiohead shocked the music industry by releasing the album In Rainbows on a “pay-as-much-as-you-want” model. Radiohead was the first superstar group to post its own album as a completely free digital download.
With its latest release, The King of Limbs, the band has produced yet another genius work of media navigation. Even the most casual music fans were likely shocked when the band suddenly announced last Monday that the album would be released the following Saturday.
As if the extremely hushed release date wasn’t enough to gain the band sufficient press coverage for the upcoming album, the band pulled another surprising move. They released it Friday, a day early.
Along with the album release, came a video of singer Thom Yorke strangely contorting his body in some form of dance to the album’s lead single, “Lotus Flower.”  The video spread quickly on the Internet, inspiring a humorous trend of mock videos using Thom’s recorded dance but replacing Radiohead’s song with songs ranging from Beyonce’s “Single Ladies” to Guns ‘N Roses’ “Welcome to the Jungle.”
With all the press, hype and mystery surrounding the album, one might easily assume The King of Limbs to be the band’s masterpiece. But in fact, it fails to live up to the quality of the band’s classics OK Computer and Kid A by a long shot.
Where those albums were works of musical mastery, The King of Limbs and its predecessor In Rainbows are works of PR mastery.
By conventional standards, however, The King of Limbs is still a great album.
With its disjointed drums, bass and layered, dreamy strings, “Bloom,” the album opener, almost sounds like a classical orchestra chaotically warming up for the entirety of its five minute length. Somehow, the parts all fit together and hook you in as Yorke’s nearly indistinguishable lyrics soar and entrance.
Like most of Radiohead’s work, The King of Limbs is spacey and slow, best enjoyed and more easily digestible in a calm, quiet and secluded setting.
What the band lacks in energy, however, it replaces with musical craftsmanship.
From the relentless beats on “Morning Mr. Magpie” to the tense, ticking sound on “Little By Little,” the band has complete control over its imaginative rhythms. It tinkers with time and meter effortlessly, and every change in tempo or style feels carefully executed.
This complexity does not always produce exciting results. For instance, the extremely warped voices on “Feral” drag on for far too long and fail to transition into anything captivating. It’s a song that messes with the mind but does not beg for multiple listens.
The albums’ high points occur when the band forgoes the complicated beats, trading them in for instruments like piano and acoustic guitar. The song “Give up the Ghost” has the same trance-like effect as the electronic and percussion-heavy songs, but the lack of a fast and consistent beat leaves more room for the listener to focus on the acoustic guitar instrumentation and layered lyrics.
Similarly, “Codex” substitutes the intense beats for a soft but powerful piano line. Those two subsequent songs provide a much appreciated break from the rest of the album’s more repetitive nature.
With or without Thom Yorke’s interesting dance accompaniment, “Lotus Flower” is one of the album’s best tracks.  It has the most variation of all the songs on the album, and contains strong lyrics such as I will sneak myself into your pocket / Invisible, do what you want, do what you want.
Overall, The King of Limbs feels as rushed as the band’s sudden announcement last Monday. It’s certainly a good album, but it lacks the variation and melodic tones found on many of Radiohead’s earlier releases.
If the band wants to pull another PR stunt anytime soon, it should make sure it’s capable of producing something comparable to its past gems.

This past week the bibliophile in me took a bit of a hit. Borders, one of the largest bookstore chains in the country, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy and announced it will be closing around 30 percent of its stores.
Having spent much of my youth inside stores like Borders, this was not pleasant news.
How did Borders hit such a low? Have people seriously stopped reading books?
Did the literary cash cows that are Harry Potter and Twilight finally run out of steam? Not really. People are still reading, but hard copy books are on the decline. Digital is all the rage.
E-books like the Amazon Kindle or Barnes and Noble’s Nook have helped these companies stay afloat as the book market crumbles, because those companies took advantage of the massively growing digital market.
It seems that these days everything is becoming digital and all these products and services are being consolidated into single packages, be it e-books, tablets or cell phones. In a way, it’s a dream come true: everything one could want in one device.
So what is the problem? If everything is coming together on digital platforms, isn’t that progress?
Integrating technology into everyday life is not just good, but it is essential for functioning in the 21st century, whether you’re a geek or not.
But there’s a difference between using technology to be more efficient and becoming dependent on technology.
Dependence can be more of a hassle than anything. Take e-books.
Yes, there is a major advantage to having one device that can hold all the textbooks needed for a semester, but what happens if the e-book goes missing or breaks? Suddenly things get very, very bad.
Have you ever lost your cell phone? It turns your life upside down.
You’re cut off from contacts, have no alarm clock and quite often, no Internet or calendar.
This is a time when the average age at which a kid gets his first cell phone is eight, according to The Telegraph.
Mobile technology can now do everything from updating Twitter accounts to flinging perturbed birds across the screen to starting cars without car keys. And today’s culture is entirely based around having the latest, greatest, all-in-one device.
Still, sometimes finding a piece of useful technology and sticking with it for a long time — as long as it continues to work and doesn’t break — can be much more stable and efficient, not to mention cheaper.
Getting an e-reader, that’s fine. Updating to a new one if certain content is only available on the more recent model? Also good.
But if you keep buying the new one just because, then that’s just hopping on a trend, which isn’t smart. It’s not geek, it’s simply falling into a state of dependency.
Now, does this mean Skynet, the top manufacturer of Terminators, is going to take advantage of our failure to control technology usage? Except for IBM’s Watson A.I., more than likely not.
But at the rate that tech has and continues to integrate itself into daily life, perhaps it’s time to take a step back and re-examine how society uses technology, and see if perhaps it might be wiser to actually flip through pages rather than hit the “next page” button.
Yes, e-readers and their technological cousins have their benefits.
For college students struggling to save money, digital textbooks are a cheap and efficient option.
Yet there are some benefits to going old school in certain parts of life.
Sometimes it’s easier to stay organized with a notepad and pen than with an online calendar.
At the very least, it might be smarter to hold onto that textbook or those car keys, just in case something happens to your app-loaded smart phone.
I love my laptop, but sometimes nothing beats strolling through a library for an exciting read, sitting down and cracking open an actual book. Page-turners are so much more fulfilling when you actually turn the page.
And that experience is only made better when it takes place inside a Borders.

The term “parkour” might bring to mind the Madagascar chase scene in Casino Royale or Michael Scott’s desk-scaling antics in The Office. But for Ryan Doyle, it’s a way of life.
Renee Cohn | Daily Trojan
At 26, Doyle is one of the most visible and active freerunners in the world. In 2007, the British native won the Red Bull Art of Motion competition in Vienna.
Fresh off filming a documentary about freerunning in Mexico, Doyle ended up in Los Angeles for a few days to relax, prepare for his next challenge and put his parkour talents to work in the city and at USC.
Parkour, sometimes called the art of displacement, is a discipline of movement aimed at getting to a destination in the most direct, efficient way possible.
Its cousin, freerunning, is sometimes criticized for being more “showy” in its use of spins, flips and other tricks.
But Doyle does not like the distinction.
“I like to think of myself as a freerunner that does parkour,” he said.
Doyle has been doing his brand of parkour and freerunning for 11 years and has competed professionally in freerunning for eight years.
Since winning the Art of Motion competition, Doyle has become Red Bull’s parkour ambassador and a consultant for the competition.
Doyle’s interest in freerunning was a natural progression from childhood.
“You could say parkour found me,” he said. “As a kid I was always climbing trees and stuff like that. When I grew up, I took that along with my martial arts background and just went into parkour.”
For Doyle, parkour is more utilitarian than freerunning, but he says the two are intertwined. Doyle also stressed that freerunning is not random. Each run takes preparation, forward thinking and a strong awareness of one’s environment.
“It’s all mental,” he said. “I’ve mentally got to connect the dots to get to a goal. It’s the same in life. You connect the dots to overcome obstacles. People always look at someone doing it and think he’s crazy, but a lot of it is calculated.”
Freerunning requires a lot of concentration, and Doyle works to make sure he’s physically and mentally prepared for each move.
In fact, he says he worries more about not experimenting than about messing up or hurting himself.
“I’ve got to do something every day,” he said. “A flip or something, just to keep me alert. The word ‘dangerous’ is based on past examples. ‘Oh, this happened, so I shouldn’t do it.’ Well, I did this, and it worked, so it’s not dangerous. It’s all relative.”
This mindset was evident as Doyle went to work on USC’s campus on Wednesday, climbing, jumping, flipping and sliding over stairways at the bookstore, rails at Leavey Library, even doing flips off the statue of Traveler on Trousdale Parkway.
Even when he failed to complete a move, he was quick to shrug it off and try again.
“Every time I do something and it works, I’m like, ‘Wow,’” Doyle said.
This feeling is what drives his love of freerunning. According to Doyle, freerunning is so open to interpretation and different styles that the only determining factor is what each person brings to the sport.
“If you look at one guy do a flip, how do you know he’s doing it correctly?” Doyle asked.
Doyle also sees parkour as a way to help get people active.
“People want to be Spider-man, they say go buy the video game, twiddle your thumbs,” Doyle said. “If I want to be Spider-man, I go out and do it.”
But even with parkour’s growing popularity, Doyle isn’t concerned with getting famous from it. He is happy practicing what he loves.
“I’m not materialistic, I’m not religious,” he said. “I just want to live.”
Much props to this man! It takes a lot of gumption, discipline and mental fortitude to do these kinds of things. I wish I was there to see his talent.

USC coach Lane Kiffin has tabbed Ted Gilmore to coach arguably the team’s most exciting position entering the 2011 season: Its young stable of gifted receivers, headlined of course by Robert Woods, the Pac-10 Freshman Offensive Player of the Year.
“I’m thrilled to welcome Ted Gilmore to the Trojan football family,” said Kiffin in a statement. “For years, he has been regarded as an outstanding recruiter and wide receivers coach. He comes to us highly recommended by a number of very prominent coaches. I’m excited for him to start working with our talented group of receivers.”
The vacancy on Lane Kiffin’s staff opened after former wide receivers coach John Morton left to pursue an NFL coaching career with the San Francisco 49ers under new head coach Jim Harbaugh.
Gilmore, who played college football at Wyoming and broke into the coaching profession with his alma mater, has also had brief coaching stints with Kansas, Houston, Purdue and Colorado, before he moved to Nebraska where has coached the Cornhuskers’ receivers for the last six seasons.
Gilmore has also served as Nebraska’s recruiting coordinator from 2007-2010.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced Wednesday that the Obama administration “will no longer defend” the Defense of Marriage Act. DOMA, a 1996 law that allows states to not recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states, was seen as an appropriate compromise in the mid-90s, but has since become a lightning rod for criticism from gay rights activists.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
In his announcement, Holder clarified that the administration will continue to enforce the law, as is its constitutional responsibility, but that both he and President Barack Obama had concluded that the law itself, in particular Section 3, which defines marriage at the federal level as between a man and a woman, was not constitutional.
Therefore, the President has encouraged the courts to re-evaluate the Act and instructed the Justice Department to stop defending it in trial, while still permitting civil society groups to do so.
It is important to note that Obama’s decision does not, despite a widely seen Fox News report that was subsequently shown to be completely false, shirk the executive branch’s constitutional duties. The administration is not breaking any laws.
It is, however,  throwing the considerable power of the Presidency behind the cause of gay rights in a controversial way, as it is unclear that the Justice Department’s role is to actively oppose in court the very same laws it is expected to enforce on the street.
For this reason, Obama and Holder’s decision sets a dangerous precedent. Regardless of one’s position on gay marriage — I happen to agree that Section 3 of DOMA violates LGBT community members’ constitutional rights — this is not the proper means through which to reach a desired end.
In part, the problem with the Justice Department’s new policy is that it is part of a trend. Last year, Holder announced that the Justice Department would no longer enforce federal laws against medical marijuana in states that permit its sale and use.
This was another sensible idea, that the federal government should not be wasting its resources chasing the perpetrators of relatively harmless activities sanctioned by the states, but again it was achieved through questionable means.
The combination of these two policies establishes the expectation that Presidents can use their executive power to steer the law a certain way. That is supposed to be the purview of Congress.
Though I have written here before that the American system of government is currently biased in favor of the legislature, the Justice Department’s actions in these instances go too far and target the wrong policy areas.
It is important for the President to have more autonomy in economic and national security policy, which can be dangerously muddled by Congressional politicking.
On social matters such as gay marriage and drug enforcement, however, it is the give and take of Congress that leads laws to change gradually over time.
The Obama administration’s new DOMA policy is not only of questionable constitutionality, it is also poor strategy.
By establishing a standard that the President can use the power of the Justice Department to affect change in the law, Obama is leaving room for his hard-fought victories to be overturned easily by future ideological opponents.
The next Republican president could, for example, use Obama’s model to oppose health insurance reform or even gay marriage itself, by lending federal support to states that will surely continue to fight it after its inevitable legalization.
This hypothetical situation demonstrates how shifting the prerogative for social change from Congress to the Executive branch could lead to wilder swings in policy, replacing the gradual reform that has marked most of American history.
Though at times American gradualism can be frustrating, it at least reflects public opinion and avoids the possibility of regression.
Our traditional channels of social change, popular opinion leading to legislative and judicial reforms, are worth preserving.
Despite Obama’s great intentions in fighting DOMA, his new policy risks winning the battle, but losing the war.

Daily Trojan, I do not have the patience for any more of these articles. Please educate your writers on the constitution before you let them write about it. When you don’t, it severely hurts our reputation as an intelligent school. Some of us would like to get jobs after we graduate.
@a law student: RIGHT ON! So many articles in the Daily Trojan make the students look like idiots. I recently moved here from a Cambridge, MA Ivy League school and if I only read the newspaper, I would think USC was one of the dumbest campuses I have ever worked on! Fortunately, I interact with smart, wonderful USC students every day.
Perhaps the Author should have used “Slippery Slope” instead of “Dangerous Precedent”. But please (a law student) tell us how the author is “uneducated” (my words) on the US Constitution?
You made a broad general statement w/o specifics.
I find this utterly confusing.  I heard the other day on Democracy Now! that this will allow gay people to bring their loved ones into the US that might currently have no way other than applying for immigration  to be with their partner and use the marriage entitlement to make them legal citizens.  While this would be a nice thing for those that are separated does one have to live in a state that currently allows for legal unions or have we revived the full faith of the government?  And if one would legalize a loved one will it or can it be overturned with the next whim of the next president?  I don’t like purgatory but that’s what this feels like.  I would prefer to know how to navigate my rights and the law.
Similarly, in PA they have started banning of cellphone use while driving vehicles but they’ve been doing it by municipality.  Some only target texting while other muni’s target cellphones in general.  How is one to know when they take a trip to visit a relative or friend and cross muni or even state lines and get pulled over every 10 miles to be given a new ticket?  It’s madness and just a money maker for muni’s that decide to enforce it.  But it seems to me that it should be unenforceable because one has no way of knowing the laws of every municipality and state.  It places too much of a burden on the driver.
So what will the next law be that this president will not defend? Privacy Laws? Property Rights? Drug laws? Labor rights? Clean air? Torture? DMCA?
Our country is founded with three pillars. Each is distinct. Each has a specific responsibility. Make law, Enforce Law, Judge Law. 
What happens when one branch of government doesn’t do its job? I agree this is a terrible precedent when a government worker intentionally does less than his best. Does the TSA worker have the right to judge the law and stop screening luggage because it violates privacy rights in that TSA worker’s opinion?
Normal people quit or resign when they cannot do their job.
@Christopher Ganiere: Are you paying to go to school at USC? If so, you need to ask for a refund for some of your early course work. I can’t believe what you wrote in this comment!
What Mr. Charnoff is missing is that this case, filed in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals turns specifically on the issue of whether gays constitute a “suspect class.” This is a brilliant piece of legal strategy on the part of gay rights activists. What it means is that it’s not enough to argue that DOMA is the will of the Congress — if Obama wants to defend DOMA (a law not worth defending if there ever were one) then he actually has to instruct his Attorney General to go to court and argue that gays have never been discriminated against in the history of the United States. Good luck with that one, buddy.
I love that Daniel Charnoff, a senior majoring in international relations, believes he has a better idea of how the President’s actions will affect the future of politics in the US than the President and the Justice Department. Ha!
Hey, brainwashed College Student,
He’s writing an opinion. I’m sorry you don’t agree with him but if you keep up your intolerance of others some people may think your a republican. Now, if you think the president knows better on how to affect the future of politics you better ask the college for a full refund of ALL your classes because obviously you didn’t see the results of the last election.
@Just a thought: You’re an idiot. Maybe you should go to college, you illiterate jerk.
It only took one post for you to start the ad hominem attacks…I love the hypocrisy of tolerant liberals.
“The combination of these two policies establishes the expectation that Presidents can use their executive power to steer the law a certain way. That is supposed to be the purview of Congress.”
Really?  See, e.g., Presidential veto power, Marbury v. Madison (authorizing judicial review).

Faced with the realization that I will be leaving USC in May to join the “real world,” I went to the 2011 Grad Fair this week to learn about all things commencement and finally be able to answer my mother’s questions about announcements, sashes and everything else I don’t want to think about.
After perusing the booths, which explained how to donate to the senior gift options I don’t like and how to purchase a video of the commencement ceremony,  I finally came to what I was looking for: caps and gowns.
I looked at the price tag and walked away. I’ll be wearing my robes from high school, thank you very much.
In case you haven’t been enlightened, undergraduates can rent a robe, cap and tassel for $50 from the USC Bookstore. If you want a standard sash with either the USC logo or seal (but not both!) it’s an extra $45. You can personalize a sash for a mere $75, though, and add up to eight letters before having to buy extra ones for $3 a pop. You can also add a crest for your house or organization — but that’ll be an extra $10 each.
Hopefully, you weren’t too involved around campus.
I also hope you don’t have many people who’ll want invitations. You can get 25 of those for only $59.95.
Suddenly, an already stressful day is accompanied by a stressful price tag.
And here’s the kicker: If you want to buy a robe, prices begin at $135. A cap with tassel is an extra $35.
Granted, sashes and announcements and owning the robe you worked so hard to wear are extras. You don’t need them. You can do commencement on a budget and get the basics.
But should we be forced to pinch so many pennies when we’ve already given so much to USC?
Other schools offer better deals. You can rent a robe and buy a cap, tassel and stole at Stanford for $54. And at UCLA, you can get a cap, gown and degree tassel to keep for $35. You can get 25 announcements for $40. You get a sash for $35.
Wait, you want me to buy a class ring or a yearbook, too? I’d love to, but all my money is going toward my dowdy attire.
Everyone is quick to congratulate us on our upcoming accomplishment. Graduating from college — especially from one like USC — is no small feat, and our families are preparing for the trek to Los Angeles to celebrate what we have achieved.
This is supposed to be one of the most memorable events of our lives, one we are supposed to be glad to be a Trojan and thankful for our years at USC. It’s beginning to seem more like a last-ditch effort by the USC Bookstore to squeeze out a few more bucks from us before we leave.
Ultimately, the bookstore needs to remember its patrons. The university is quick to tout the fact that 60 percent of students at USC receive some type of financial assistance, but that isn’t reflected by the high prices in bookstore aisles. Getting a cut on tuition is very much appreciated, but that doesn’t help me pay $50 to rent a robe for a day.
Some of us work while taking classes. Some of us don’t have credit cards, or only use them for emergencies. Some of us are paying for our own graduation materials rather than sending the bill to our parents. And some of us are just happy enough that our parents will be able to take time off work and fly across the country to be with us on May 13 — we feel guilty hitting them up for hundreds of dollars on top of that.
I guess that means some of us will be wearing our robes from high school after all.

I feel ya Kate! Don’t even get me started on the Master’s degree costs to rent a robe & all that jazz. Herf Jones, the company that’s handling all the commencement stuff did my high school’s & it still wasn’t nearly as much. I just graduated from The Ohio State University and paid a full $28 to own my cap & gown. I got 150 announcements for a little more than $150. Try that with USC’s prices, 100 announcements will cost you $240! And we had 6 different campus bookstores that sold all your Grad supplies, not just this monopoly of a bookstore one-stop-shop mess. As if we weren’t paying enough already.
Like you said this is “a last-ditch effort by the USC Bookstore to squeeze out a few more bucks from us before we leave.”
Highway robbery.
Totally agree!  I had to pony up hundreds last May for our daughters graduation.  Even though we were very proud of her we felt obligated and guilted into buying everything so she would not be left out.  On top of that a 3 hotel nights, other family members coming to the event, dinner out, etc.  Somehow they should work the fee’s into the final years tuition so its spread out or covered by loans etc.  Good luck in May and be proud of all you have accomplished.
Right On!
Even though this is our school and opportunities better than at other schools in the area, we mustn’t keep our mouths closed when such outright greedy practices take place.  Even professors, tenured professors, have major grievances with the bookstore.
$200 for something we’re only wearing once is not entirely worth it.  Sure, there is great sentimental value but there is so much one can do with that money…like eat!
Thanks for the article, I just hope more students will appreciate your work.
~$150 / >$200,000 = <.00075
Paying less that .075% of what your education has already cost doesn't seem all that terrible. Try putting things in context.

USC Transportation announced a change to the hours of operation for its Campus Cruiser program in an email sent to students and faculty.
Starting on Feb. 28, the service will run for one hour less than it currently does, starting at 6:00 p.m. and ending at 2:45 a.m. Currently, the service operates from 5:00 p.m. to 2:45 a.m. daily.
USC Transportation says that the reduction in hours is aimed towards improving its service. “This will enable us to optimize our operation by focusing our resources on our high demand periods,” said the email.
The changes in operating hours will only affect the Campus Cruiser service; there will be no changes to the USC bus services.

Warner Bros. is cutting back production on New Line Cinema and will reduce the number of films they produce annually from eight to four.
The decision is said to have been made by Jeff Robinov at Warner Bros., whose plan is to decrease the number of films the studio releases each year. New Line Cinema is also at risk of having many of its personnel laid off in the coming weeks.
New Line Cinema was absorbed by Warner Bros. in 2008, when the founders of the company, Robert Shaye and Michael Lynne, made the decision to step down.
The company then had its personnel go down from 600 employees to 50. This decision will further downsize the company as they shift their focus on producing more tentpole films. New Line Cinema currently has several highly anticipated films lined up, including The Hobbit series.
These changes also bring into question whether Toby Emmerich, the President and COO of New Line Cinema, will choose to remain with the company.

Aside from touring last summer on the Vans Warped Tour, The All-American Rejects has been deeply occupied with writing new music. Now the band is ready to submerge itself into the studio to record new tracks in hopes of having its fourth record out sometime this year.
The closest things to new tracks the band has released are various remixes of their songs “Gives You Hell,” “The Wind Blows” and “I Wanna,” back in 2009. Hopefully a new single will be released in the next few months to give fans a taste of what they will be working on in the studio.
As they begin their journey in the studio, they will also continue with their latest philanthropic work. Tyson Ritter and his band mates have been dedicated to his new charity Don’t Hate On Haiti.
According to their website, the band has donated about $25,000 to a non-profit organization called Charity Water. Charity Water’s mission is to provide clean water to people all around the world. For every $5,000 the band raises, a clean water well is built in Haiti.
In an attempt to generate even more money, the band is trying to get itsfans involved by holding a contest. By April 1, the person who raises the most money will score a Don’t Hate On Haiti shirt, a signed guitar by the band and a one-on-one Skype date with the band in the studio to talk about the charity and their new music.
Sounds like a sweet deal for both the fan and the people who will receive the necessary gift of clean water.
I really appreciate those dudes.
They really have their feet on the ground.
Love them.
