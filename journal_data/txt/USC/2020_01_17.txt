Chants of “No justice, no peace, U.S. out of the Middle East” and “Up, up, up with people. Down, down, down with war” resonated through Hahn Plaza Friday as students gathered in front of Tommy Trojan to protest war against Iran. 
Around 30 people gathered at the event that was organized by Trojan Advocates for Political Progress, USC Environmental Student Assembly, Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, College Democrats at USC, and USC Students for Justice in Palestine. 
Earlier this month, President Donald Trump ordered an airstrike that targeted Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, leading to escalating tensions between the two countries that led to “World War 3” trending on social media. Days after, Iran retaliated by sending airstrikes on military bases in Iraq that were housing American troops.
The protest started with TAPP Vice President Jessica O’Connor leading the chants and thanking everyone for being there to fight for justice and peace in Iran. 
“The biggest threat to our stability sits in the White House, in Congress and at the Pentagon,” said O’Connor, a senior majoring in law, history and culture. “Dropping bombs on unsuspecting towns, while lulling us to sleep with the reassurance that this violence will never touch us, but it does touch us.” 
ESA co-director Nathaniel Hyman also addressed the crowd, emphasizing why ending the war is important environmentally.
“It was really important that environmentalists support this demonstration because there is no climate justice, no economic justice, criminal justice, justice in general for that matter,” said Hyman, a junior majoring in public policy. “When we can see that human suffering can be minimized to expendable currency and indeed, with conflict, initiated by corrupt desperate and malicious individuals.” 
After the speakers addressed the crowd about why the issue was important, O’Connor opened up the platform and encouraged students attending the protest to share their views regarding the airstrikes on Iran. 
Tianna Shaw-Wakeman, a senior majoring in psychology and social entrepreneurship, shared a story she had read in the newspaper about a little girl from Baghdad named Sarah, who hated cloudy days because she never knew when a bomb might drop from above the clouds. Shaw-Wakeman asked students to be empathetic and kind when thinking about these issues. 
“When you’re thinking about these stories … when you’re reading history textbooks about past wars America stupidly got into, that you don’t just think about the mass amount of people who died,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “Also think about Sarah … that you also think about individuals and their stories and what it would be like to actually be in a war-torn area.”
Andra Astorga, co-director of the Latinx Student Assembly, said it was important that the organization shows support to the other student organizations who put together the protest.
“We’ve supported each other in other protests,” Astorga, a senior studying health promotion and disease prevention said. “Every protest that we’ve, or at least I’ve experienced on campus has been connected in one way or another with the [other organizations].” 
Shaw-Wakeman said that protests on human rights issues are important, but most people only think about the personal problems that affect them and not on global issues. 
“I think there’s a little bit of complacency when it comes to even the thought of war with another country. It seems like something that wouldn’t affect the way of American life,” Shaw-Wakeman said.  
Truman Fritz, Undergraduate Student Government senior director of communications, said he attended the protest as a student concerned about how the war was affecting people both abroad and at home and that USC played a role in helping with military activity.
“USC has a huge stake in how military contractors and the work that they do and the partnerships that they have impacts not only the U.S. but the world at large,” said Fritz, a junior majoring in business administration. 
O’Connor also provided TAPP’s reasons for staging the protest and its importance on campus.
“TAPP thought we should do a ‘No War with Iran’ protest in solidarity with the protests across the globe that sprung up after the U.S.’s illegal and unjust actions and aggressions toward Iran,” O’Connor said. “We wanted to make sure that students knew that we were going to support that anti-war movement and wanted to give students a chance to raise their own voices.”

In its first game back at Galen Center since December, the USC men’s basketball team took care of business with a dominant 88-56 win against Cal Thursday. 
Now at 3-1 in conference play, the Trojans have improved to 14-3 overall on the season and have extended their winning streak against the Bears to five games.
The Trojans ran a tight defense in the first half, blocking the Bears from inside the arc and allowing only 7 points through the first eight minutes of play. Berkeley’s star sophomore guard Matt Bradley still provided an offensive threat with 11 points in the half, but USC’s defense held Bradley, the reigning Pac-12 Player of the Week, to just 13 points by the end of the game.
“If you hold him under his average, like we did tonight, that’s all you can ask for on a day-to-day basis,” senior guard Jonah Mathews said. “You’re not going to lock anyone to zero especially at this Pac-12 level, so holding them under average is the main thing every night and we’ve been having to do that the last couple of games.”
A staggering 61% 3-point shooting night allowed the Trojans to finish with the second-most points they’ve scored in a game all season. Mathews led both teams with 19 points on the night, knocking in 3 of 5 from beyond the arc and contributing to the team’s 75% 3-point percentage in the first half.
Besides turnovers — USC committed 14 to Cal’s 10 — the Trojans dominated the stat sheet. Senior forward Nick Rakocevic and freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu accounted for 13 of the team’s 39 defensive rebounds, and USC finished with 45 boards in total. 
The Bears finished with just 28. 
USC also collected 21 assists, aiding its offensive productivity. And although the Trojans struggled at times in the paint, the team’s ball movement is an indicator of its growing cohesiveness and rhythm. 
“It’s also a new team, new personalities, so we’re all just coming together really tight,” Mathews said. “It’s chemistry. Knowing where we’re going to be at helps and finding open shots and knocking them down.”
USC expanded its lead in the second half, pulling ahead by 20 with 11 minutes left and never looking back. 
Redshirt senior Daniel Utomi has proven to be a key player in the Trojans’ recent success, and he showed it again Thursday. Building off last week’s 13-point performance at UCLA, Utomi went 6 for 9 in the field, finishing with 17 points and seven rebounds while knocking down 4 of 6 3-pointers. 
“[Utomi] had two really good games. [He] played great against UCLA [and] played great tonight,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “He’s a very solid basketball player on both ends.”
The Trojans received strong contributions all down the lineup, as sophomore guard Elijah Weaver racked up 8 points off the bench, and freshman small forward Max Agbonkpolo contributed 7 points in just eight minutes of play. 
The game demonstrated the team’s high potential in future Pac-12 play. Defeating Berkeley proves further improvement from the team’s lopsided 72-40 loss against Washington on Jan. 5, as Thursday’s team 50% shooting clip was on par with the 57.4% performance at UCLA last week. 
The Trojans will stay at home for the weekend to face Stanford Saturday at 3:30 p.m. Stanford is the only team ahead of the Trojans in the Pac-12 standings, and USC will have to continue its offensive production to hand the Cardinal their first conference loss.

Following a successful campaign at the Oracle Pro Series Tournament, the USC men’s tennis team will look forward to continuing their dominance in the Sherwood Collegiate Cup this weekend.
Last week’s Oracle Pro Series Tournament saw Trojans thriving in both the singles and doubles brackets. Senior Brandon Holt had himself an impressive run into the semifinals of singles play before falling to Alexander Ritschard. The doubles final consisted of three Trojan players, with the all-USC pair of junior Daniel Cukierman and senior Riley Smith winning it all. 
Starting Friday, the Trojans will compete with other top players from Stanford, UCLA and Texas A&M in Thousand Oaks. Each school has eight players competing in the main draw, which consists of a total of 32 players during the four-day span. 
This tournament will be the last individual competition of the year before head coach Brett Masi’s squad begins team competition play. 
“It is kind of like just one more event to get some matches in before the start of our dual match season,” Masi said.
The Trojans kick off this year ranked No. 3 in the ITA preseason ranking, the highest ranking the team has seen since it sat at No. 1 and No. 2 in 2015 and a significant improvement from its 2019 final rank of No. 8. 
For the first time since 2013, the tennis team has seven players ranked nationally in singles as well as four nationally ranked doubles pairs. Besides that, Cukierman has become the first No. 1 ranked singles player in the nation since 2012. 
Masi said the team is confident with its position right now.
“This tournament doesn’t really have any bearing upon the pressure,” Masi said. “I think this shows the guys that they’re a good team and … just shows how competitive we can be this season but the goal of the end of the year is to have the No. 1 in front.”
The Sherwood Collegiate Classic will provide opportunities for Trojans to compete against other elite players at the collegiate level. The team hopes to build upon past successes and continue its player development throughout the tournament. 
The Trojans are setting their sights on both singles and doubles matches in Thousand Oaks, and Masi said his team will gain valuable experience by competing in plenty of matches — even if they lose in the first or second round.
“The biggest thing that I want to do is … working with the doubles pairings that maybe they haven’t played with this year and just see if they work and, you know, get them feeling comfortable with each other,” Masi said. “I think … that’s the biggest thing that we’re going to be using this tournament for.” 
Masi said that although it’s a great opportunity for singles players to gain experience by playing more matches in the tournament, the biggest things to watch for in Thousand Oaks are the chemistry and trust between doubles pairs going into the duo match season. 
“It’s more for them just to start feeling comfortable about their games, and to feel like things that we’ve worked on [in] the fall and just to get them kind of just match experience,” Masi said. 
The Trojans hope to build on their recent momentum as they compete in the Sherwood Collegiate Classic beginning Friday in Thousand Oaks.

The USC women’s basketball team is set to take on No. 7 UCLA Friday at Galen Center and will be looking for a split in the season series after falling in Westwood in December.
In the matchup, USC went down early by double digits and battled to stay in the game. A back-breaking third quarter saw the Bruins outscore USC 26-16, essentially icing the game.
USC comes into the game at 8-8 overall on the season with a five-game losing streak on its shoulders that began in that loss to UCLA to open conference play.
The Bruins come into the game undefeated at 16-0, posting a perfect 5-0 record in conference play.
UCLA will be led by junior forward Michaela Onyenwere, who’s averaging 18.9 points and 7.8 rebounds per game while shooting just over 50% from the field.
In the first crosstown contest, the Bruins were led by 21-point performances from both Onyenwere and senior guard Japreece Dean.
“She’s a future first round WNBA Draft pick, so we’ve got to play her as hard as we can,” USC head coach Mark Trakh said of Onyenwere. “So we play a straight man-to-man and we’re gonna try to stop her.”
UCLA will pose a tough task for Trakh and his unit as they aim to corral the red-hot Bruins early in the game.
“I think from the first meeting we saw that we needed the start off right out the gate and we needed to finish the game,” senior Kayla Overbeck said after practice Tuesday.
Overbeck was vocal and adamant about remaining poised when the Bruins attempt to push the tempo or make USC uncomfortable, adding that since the UCLA game, the Trojans have made it a point to increase the pace of practice both individually and as a team.
“We’re gonna do exactly what they did to us, back to them,” Overbeck said. “We’re gonna take their pressure, take everything they did to us … and just play our game.” 
The Newbury Park native is a veteran presence in the locker room for a young USC team, and Trakh praised her leadership skills.
“Kayla plays her heart out,” Trakh said. “She’s got spirit, she’s tough, she’s aggressive, she’s a great kid and she’s showing the younger kids how hard you have to play to succeed in the Pac-12.” 
In USC’s last game at Utah, five players eclipsed double-digit scoring for the first time this season, a welcomed sight for players and coaches alike. 
“Honestly, that means we’re making shots,” Overbeck said. “It’s starting to come together right before one of the biggest games.”
Trakh acknowledged the recent improvements and expressed confidence in his team moving forward, praising his team for their effort and energy heading into Friday’s matchup.
“We’re getting better every game, we just gotta improve,” Trakh said. “They’re good kids. They’re together … I love my team.” 
If Overbeck is any indication, the Trojans are energized and motivated to get revenge on the Bruins after being handled at Pauley Pavilion over two weeks ago.
“It’s really for pride because we got embarrassed,” Overbeck said. “That’s what we felt, we were embarrassed after that game and it’s to make sure that that never happens again and we do that to them.”
USC will tip off at Galen Center against the Bruins Friday at 7:30 p.m.
