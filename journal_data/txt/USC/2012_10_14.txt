USC’s women’s swim and dive team began its journey for another top finish in the country with a 165-88 win over Pac-12 opponent Utah on Saturday.
The season-opening home meet featured the debuts of USC freshmen Jasmine Tosky and Kendyl Stewart, who both took two wins on the day.
Tosky, who was a 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials finalist, finished first in the 100-yard freestyle and 200-yard butterfly, while Stewart claimed the 100-yard and 200-yard backstroke.
USC junior Meghan Hawthorne also took two wins in the meet, including a 1:48.88 finish in the 200-yard freestyle and a 4:13.60 win in the 400-yard individual medley.
The Women of Troy began the day by capturing 15 points with a 1-2-3 finish in the 400-yard medley relay.
Both Tosky and Stewart were in the first-place medley relay team, joined by senior Kasey Carlson and freshman Kasia Wilk.
Senior Haley Anderson, who represented USC at the 2012 Olympic Games with a silver medal in the 10K marathon, then took the 1,000-yard freestyle with a time of 9:49.60.
Following Anderson were junior Lynette Lim and freshman Nikki Chang with times of 10:05.45 and 10:10.38, respectively. Together, the trio tacked on 16 points to give USC an early 31-5 lead.
Anderson also claimed second-place finishes in the 200-yard butterfly and 400-yard individual medley.
After Tosky’s win in the 200-yard butterfly, Carlson edged out Wilk for a win in the 50-yard freestyle, adding another 13 points to the Women of Troy’s total.
USC senior Jessica Schmitt also captured a first-place finish in the 100-yard breaststroke to go with a 55.70 finish in the 100-yard butterfly, second only to fellow USC senior Yumi So, who finished 0.09 seconds faster.
Others who finished first included junior Stina Gardell and sophomore Andrea Kropp with wins in the 500-yard freestyle and the 100-yard breaststroke, respectively.
Kropp, who made her debut for USC after redshirting last season, was also a 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials finalist.
USC wrapped up the meet with a 1:33:45 win in the 200-yard freestyle relay.
The Women of Troy, who have eight returning All-Americans, ended the season last year with their second consecutive third-place finish at the NCAA championships in March.
USC’s matchup against Utah was the first of five conference meets before the Pac-12 championships next February. USC’s next conference opponent will be Washington State on Nov. 3.
The Women of Troy will take on San Diego at 2 p.m. at home on Friday, followed by the SMU Classic in Dallas, Texas the next day at 5 p.m. PT.

“Do you have a card?”
The answer to this question separates those who can legally purchase and smoke marijuana in the state of California from those who must resort to using sketchy dealers and smoking in secret.
This question has also received significant attention in California lately, as legislators, civilians and marijuana users alike debate the legality of medical marijuana and how it relates to recreational use.
This is attention, however, that could—and should—be focused on much more important issues facing California right now, from the state of our education system to the tax code. The legalization of marijuana is a small fish in a big pond; we shouldn’t even be debating it at all.
California has relaxed marijuana legislation relative to the rest of the United States. For those who carry a medical marijuana card, private use of the drug is completely legal. Thanks to a bill based by former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2010, those who don’t have a card but are caught with up to an ounce of weed simply receive an infraction instead of a misdemeanor charge.
There are two reasons why there was a downgrade for the offense. First, marijuana is not nearly as harmful as  staunch anti-marijuana advocates make it out to be. Marijuana is not physically addictive, tends to calm people down rather than promote aggression and violence (like alcohol) and has been accepted by the medical community as a safe and effective treatment for ailments such as insomnia and epilepsy.
Second, excessive prosecution for marijuana charges clogs up our court system and jam-packs our already overcrowded prisons. What’s the point?
By legalizing marijuana, time and resources can be put towards more prevalent issues, ones that affect the majority of California residents.
People are going to smoke no matter what, and it would be much better for the industry to be legally controlled. In the meantime, all the attention, money and resources that currently are being diverted into the marijuana debate could be used to tackle some of the state’s other problems.
It’s pretty sad that after prop19 failed to pass because so many of the profiteers didn’t want it to upset their lifestyle, they promised they would craft a more ‘fair’ legalization inititave for 2012. Interestingly  enough that idea never materialized. As long as it is still illegal, the prices stay high and the growers and dispensary owners and gangs enjoy the profits while tens of thousands of others go to jail every year.
Cannabis is far safer and far less addictive than alcohol. We could GREATLY reduce the amount of harm and addiction in society by giving people the right to switch from the more harmful drug, alcohol, to the less harmful drug, cannabis.
It is outrageous for our elected officials to actively prevent this reduction of harm in society!!
We are Americans..we live in a free country…this is what we have been told since birth.  
The prohibition of marijuana is a farce. It is the few telling the many what they may and may not do.  We are a free people.  It is time to start living the way our forefathers intended.
Law enforcement needs to re-direct its focus on crime…to those that are REAL crimes.
I was in Federal Prison for 5 years for a marijuana offense. No, it was not for simple possession. I was arrested aboard a Lockheed PV2 in Marianna, Florida…charged and convicted for conspiracy to import and distribute 12,000 pounds of marijuana.
At the time, I really had no idea what I had gotten myself into…mine was an offense involving pot…the thought never occurred to me that I may actually spend years in prison for that ‘indiscretion.’
As my years in prison rolled by, what I did see were armed bank robbers, coming and going…while I still sat there for marijuana. Most of the bank robbers only spent 17 to 24 months. But, I and my fellow ‘drug offenders,’…we stayed for YEARS.
I wrote about the escapades that led to my incarceration. I admit, I had a great time. No one was injured, no one was killed, firearms were not involved…there were no victims.
We were Americans…doing what Americans do best…living free.
Truly, it is time for this lunacy to end…it never should have begun.
My book: Shoulda Robbed a Bank
It is about living free.
I would be honored by your review.

One of the worst things about being gluten-free? It’s hard to snack.
I’m not talking about those celebrities who say that their favorite snack is “celery.” Fact: Celery is not a snack — it’s just God’s way of saying, “Hungry? Here’s something awful for you to eat.”
No, when you’re a busy college student trying to go to four classes back to back to back to back and you barely have 10 minutes to get from VKC to Viterbi, let alone eat a healthy gluten-free snack, life gets difficult.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I have the schedule mentioned above. With no time for breakfast in the morning, I often resort to scarfing down a banana between my second and third class and then using gum to satiate my grumbling stomach until 3:30. Once 3:30 hits, people better move out of the Campus Center because I tear up Lemonade like no other.
I know I’m not alone. Although I don’t like to put too much emphasis on what I eat so that it doesn’t turn into a disorder of some kind, when you have an allergy and a busy schedule it’s imperative to get at least some planning down. When you’re hungry, you can’t focus; when you can’t focus, class feels as long as The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
That’s why it’s incredibly important to keep snacks at the ready. If you don’t have time for breakfast, make sure you pack a banana, orange, small bag of kettle chips and water for the day. Easy snacks that you can finish during your walk from class to class will keep your mind focused on academics instead of your stomach.
Also, make sure that you stay hydrated. Being hungry sucks, but being dehydrated not only sucks — it’s incredibly dangerous. Odwalla products like Mango Tango are thick enough to keep you full and delicious enough to keep you happy.
When all else fails, remember to try and schedule your classes for the next semester a little bit better. Hey, even a 30-minute lunch break can do wonders.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Thursday, Oct. 11 and Friday, Oct. 12. 
Crimes against property
at 11:04 p.m. on Oct. 11, an unidentified subject drove his vehicle into a university cart that was inside Parking Strucure X then left the scene without stopping to report the incident or leave contact information. DPS officers subsequently used surveillance recordings to identify the vehicle and the information was turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department for a traffic investigation.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 9:30 a.m. on Oct. 11, a student reported she sustained several broken teeth and a scrape to her chin when she fell while riding her skateboard near the intersectin of Jefferson Boulevard and Orchard Street. The student did not report the incident at the time it occurred and sought medical/dental treatment on her own.
At 4:30 p.m. on Oct. 11, DPS officers responded to a staff member who fainted in a restroom at Keck Hospital of USC. A rapid response team was at the scene examining the staff member when the officers arrived, and she was subsequently transported within the facility for medical treatment.
at 12:32 a.m. on Oct. 12, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated non-USC male who was observed lying on the sidewalk near 1484 29th Street. The man was incoherent when contacted by the officers, so an LAFD RA unit was requested.  RA Unit #13 examined the man, but he refused to be transported for medical treatment.  Concerned for his safety, the officers were unwilling to release the male at the scene, so he was arrested and transported to Metropolitan Detention Center for booking.
There goes her boyfriend’s weekend.   Maybe he will dump her as I don’t think toothless is particularly attractive since the advent of the modern dentistry in the last century…

The number of eligible Latino voters has leapt from 19.5 million in 2008 to an unprecedented 23.7 million nationally, according to a recently released report by the Pew Research Center.
Data from the Pew Hispanic Center’s Census Bureau show that Latinos now hold a greater share of eligible voters at 11 percent, as compared to 9.5 percent in 2008.
Latinos are the largest minority group in the United States. In 2011, the 51.9 million Latinos in the nation made up 16.7 percent of the American population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
This record number, however, will not mean much if it is not followed by a higher turnout rate, according to Roberto Suro, a professor of journalism with expertise in Latino public opinion and U.S. Hispanic population growth.
“The growth in the number of voters doesn’t mean that much. This is a growing population. That number has been growing consistently for many years and will continue for many more,” Suro said. “The real question here is not how many are eligible, but how many people actually turn out.”
According to the Pew report, the turnout rate of eligible Latino voters has “historically lagged that of whites and blacks by substantial margins.” In the 2008 election, 50 percent of Latino voters cast their ballots, significantly lower than the 65 percent of blacks and 66 percent of whites who turned out four years ago.
But Suro said change might be on the horizon.
“The number has been rising in the past few elections, and the question is, will the trend continue? Will we see greater participation by eligible voters in this election?” Suro said. “This is very important for the Democrats in particular because we know this vote tilts very heavily toward Democratic.”
Bringing naturalized citizens into the picture, the Center for the Study of Immigration Integration at USC recently released “Rock the (Naturalized) Vote,” a report that suggests naturalized immigrants in the Latino community might be critical as the election draws near. This demographic could be crucial to the election not only because it is the group with most room for improvement in registration rates, but also because the recently naturalized are the most sensitive to immigration concerns.
“In the past, naturalized voters, particularly for their first election, have high turnout rates,” Suro said. “It’s their first chance to vote and they tend to use the franchise when they’ve got the chance. This is a relatively newly naturalized population, so a high turnout is expected.”
Despite this record increase and rapid population growth, Latinos still make up a smaller part of the electorate. The Center for Immigration Studies, however, found that though Latino voter share varies in the 18 battleground states,;in four of the states — New Mexico, Florida, Nevada and Arizona — they will be “more than 16 percent of the vote” in the next election.
“Looking at the presidential race, Latinos only have presence in a few swing states — among them Florida, Nevada and Colorado,” Suro said.  “They have different types of Latino populations, but in those places, all three remain important swing states.”
As the Latino population in the United States continues to expand, native-born citizens are aging in large numbers in the electorate. Young adults, however, tend to vote less often than older adults, according to Suro. Looking into the upcoming elections, the participation of young adults “becomes a very important question politically this year,” Suro predicted.
On campus, the overall  atmosphere reflects the newly charged political attitude of the youth. El Centro Chicano, an on-campus support and resource center for Latino students and their families, strives to boost political awareness among young Latino adults. El Centro Chicano will host a Leadership Development and Skill-Building series Tuesday where speakers will share experiences regarding the importance of voting and being politically aware.
Carolina Varela, a sophomore majoring in civil engineering who is involved with the organization, believes that the number of Latino voters is crucial to the election.
“I think it’s a step forward and it signifies that we, as a community, just have to encourage people, now that they’re registered, to do research, look into voting and finally go cast ballots,” Varela said.
Though it remains unclear whether the record-breaking 24 million eligible Latino voters will boost overall election turnout, Varela said the number in itself is significant to the future of the Latino community across the nation.
“We haven’t had a history of having a voice, and now that these leaders here at the university are encouraging people to go out there and vote, it’s definitely something that will help our community,” she said. “This generation of Latinos is ready to speak up and be a part of the voting process.”
“We haven’t had a history of having a voice, and now that these leaders here at the university are encouraging people to go out there and vote, it’s definitely something that will help our community.”
————–And just what “community” is that?  Latinos?  Or ALL AMERICANS?  If the former, don’t be surprised that Americans in general will oppose amnesty and any such attempts to expand the “Latino vote”.
Gee, David.  I was going to post my protest to the growing hispanic invasion, but you took the words right out of my mouth and added a good thought or two.
Fight On
JLH
ARE we just going to keep on importing more and more wretched poverty, stifling the honest immigrants that wait patiently for years on our doorstep? Is the U.S government ignored for decades a need for tracking visitors, or even intentionally cutting off funds for constructing the real double layer fence at the border, committed by the George Bush presidency under the 2006 secure Fence act. I often wonder if there is some secret pact between those authorities south of the border and our own agencies, which we will accept a certain amount of their desperate illegal migrants, to proliferate for farming and corporate entities. This is self evident when the majority Liberal Sacramento assembly, wants to give some form of feigned identification that the police will have to deal with? The voters in the “Sanctuary State” should be well aware, that in Los Angeles especially they are pressing for more money for education in their Proposition 30, because the schools are clogged with the children of illegal aliens and taxpayers are expected to pay?
A  WARNING THAT IF PRESIDENT OBAMA IS VOTED INTO THE OVAL OFFICE AGAIN, WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF CONTRADICTION HE WILL COMMITT HIMSELF AND HIS LIBERAL CZARS TO MIND BUCKLING COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. AN ANOTHER MASS AMNESTY THAT THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION STATES THROUGH THEIR STATISTICAL RESEARCH WILL COST TAXPAYERS OVER 2 TRILLION DOLLARS TO PROCESS AND COMPLETE. NOT JUST A DREAM ACT WITH 3/4 OF A MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE, BUT AN OFFERING OF A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR AN ESTIMATED 20 MILLION ILLEGAL ALIENS AND COUNTING. JUST THE TEA PARTY STANDS IN THE WAY OF ANOTHER TRAVESTY OF OUR IMMIGRATIONENFORCEMENT OF THE 1986 BILL.
UNLESS OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS ARE REALLY ENFORCED, SUCH AS A FELONY, THE UNCEASING FLOW OF ILLEGAL ALIENS WILL NEVER STOP.
WE have Obama’s Department of Justice continuously attacking states as Arizona, because they can least afford the hundreds of millions of dollars states are forced by the courts to pay for free medical care, education for the children of illegal aliens throughout this country. Hundreds of billions of dollars are literary extracted from taxpayer’s pockets, to pay for illegal aliens stealing into America with unborn babies to pay for their delivery, their education and public welfare cash payments. 
The TEA PARTY “THE PEOPLES PARTY” has stepped up to the plate. The TEA PARTY OF ALL RELIGIOUS DENOMINATION, EVERY CLASS, EVERY RACE ARE FED UP AND FRUSTRATED WITH THESE FREE GIVEAWAYS. NOW AN ESTIMATED 41 MILLION TEA PARTY MEMBERS AND STILL GATHERING STEAM AND ARE OPENLY FLOWING INTO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ARE READY TO TACKLE THE CORRUPTION IN BOTH PARTIES. 
ODDLY ENOUGH THE LIBERAL JOURNALISTS IN THE MAINSTREAM PRESS THINK THE WHOLE MOVEMENT HAS DISSOLVED, AFTER THE MASSIVE CROWD THAT OVERWELMED WASHINGTON DC SOME YEARS AGO. WE ARE STILL HERE AND WILL BE CAREFULLY WATCHING THE VOTING PUBLIC IN NOVEMBER. WHEN 71 PERCENT OF LEGAL HISPANICS HAVE STATED THEY WANT PHOTO ID’s SHOULD SHOWN, TO PROOF WHO THEY ARE ACCORDING TO THE PEW HISPANIC CENTER.
The children of illegal aliens have been unaware of their status, caused by their criminal parents entering our country? The Mother should be held responsible and deported as they have cost for decades record amounts of taxpayers’ money. SO UNLESS A SIMPLE CHANGE TO 14th AMENDMENT IS IMPOSED, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT SHOULD BE GOING TO OUR OWN POOR, OUR OWN HOMELESS OUR OWN CITIZENS, INSTEAD OF BEING APPROPRIATED TO PAY FOR ILLEGAL ALIEN WELFARE.
 Today there has been a remedy for them through President Obama’s executive preference, although it should have been voted on in the Congress. This inconceivable problem will never go away and will indeed get far worse unless Congress enacts the BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP BILL. It is highly controversial and unless an amendment is forthcoming, the state treasuries will be forever drained. Pregnant mothers coming here with the deliberate plan to have their child on welfare and the hundreds of Billions of dollars extracted by inept federal laws of that says children born here automatically receive citizenship.  The illegal alien parent is feeding from the welfare trough, without ever paying a cent into the fund. This can only escalate further as President Obama is encouraging illegal immigrants and migrants to come, by delivering free food stamps without any restrictions. Just look at California, THE SANCTUARY CITY STATE” Where Los Angeles city Administrator gave out the latest payout of the children of illegal alien parents. Two months and a hundred sixty million dollars later and now Los Angeles is pushing for another tax hike. This is incredulous-to let our lousy, incompetent federal government pay for all these illegal aliens in this border state. NO WONDER CALIFORNIA IS IN A DOWNWARD FISCAL SPIN?
Only the enactment to this amendment can stop this problem by making it official that only the children of at least one parent being a U.S. citizen. Also waiting for a vote in the House is mandatory E-verify “THE LEGAL WORKFORCE ACT” law to halt illegal aliens taking citizens and lawful resident’s jobs. Why this law remains dormant to show how many the politicians care about the legal workers, although this law has been carefully hidden from site by none other than Democrat majority leader Harry Reid. Why with 8.1 percent of Americans are jobless, why either the House or Senate refuses to bringing either of these laws to the HOUSE AND SENATE CHAMBERS.
Obviously the 47 percent mainstream Liberal-Communist-Marxist progressives will provide the ammunition to attack Romney, but they will stay silent about the pandering to the “Freeloaders” the scroungers, parasites and illegal aliens who live off the rest of us. Not forgetting that many in the percentage are the infirm, sick and handicapped that needs a helping hand.
As the TEA PARTY.ORG STATE and you should read the evidence to support it: 
Why both Democrats and Republicans are are afraid of getting tough and both are refusing to protect our Constitution. They want to play it safe, not ruffle any feathers and play dumb when it comes to what made our nation great and what keeps it great. How many times have you asked yourself: WHERE ARE THEY? WHAT ARE THEY DOING? They sit silent, do nothing. Too much of the Republican Party is run by knuckle-dragging Neanderthals practicing caveman politics while the Democrat’s ranks are filled with liberal-Marxist progressives practicing global communism.
What’s America to do? It is very simple: All law abiding citizen be the resistance. Oust Obama now. 
News Flash: The values embedded in our Constitution come right out of the Bible, reinforced by the will to be a free people. The Tea Party knows it and that is what makes us so dangerous to the Obama and his collection of Liberal Progressives and Kool-Aid drinking Republicans.
Think I’m kidding? Listen up, this week Senator Harry Reid of Nevada sent out an urgent plead for money saying: 
“I don’t want to wake up on November 7th wishing I could have done more to prevent a Tea Party takeover of Congress.”
It’s no wonder Senator, when you have just about killed every new bill to pass through the Congress. You even crippled E-Verify, which would achieve removing hundreds of thousands or even millions of illegal workers and opening the closed doors for citizens and legal residents.
As I read his plea I realized he wasn’t fearful of Islamic terrorists on a Jihad, flying planes into buildings—or even another ambassador being savagely dragged out of a U.S. Embassy to be burned alive in the name of a false God.
Nor was Senator Harry Reid worried about Wall Street crashing or the dollar becoming worthless.
Our country is going to hell in a hand basket, the Middle East is burning our flag in effigy and bad seed Reid fears…a Tea Party takeover. 
Of all the lame-brained, half-assed ideas, Harry Reid, this takes the cake.
For a U.S. Senator to be alarmed of the very people who believe in preserving America is downright insanity. Absolutely ludicrous! Around 41 million average American, young, old, different religious persuasion and diverse class of people who are black, white, Hispanic and all races.
Reid actually believes the Tea Party is more dangerous to President Obama and the liberal progressives, than all the murdering terrorists combined? Let me put this a little more succinctly:
In the eyes of a leftist, an 81-year old grandma with a cardboard sign is more lethal than a crazed terrorist zealot with a machete whose sole intent is to murder. The Obama administration will not even call these fanatics “Terrorists” or murderers, even after the Twin Towers massacre of 9/11?
Why would Reid believe that? 
Because the Tea Party believes in everything he and his cronies do not as they have proven again and again these past four years:
Pledging allegiance to the U.S. Flag, not burning it; Honoring the Constitution, not destroying it; Voting for God and not voting God out; Legal immigration not the illegal alien invasion; Fiscal responsibility, not spend-a-holic politics.
•	Make sense now? We are in a war to save our American heritage! If the Obama Czars were to get their way, they would erase our heritage and rewrite it to reflect their poison values and their twisted idea of what America should be: a socialist regime.
If the Global Communist Obama Czars were to grab America they would:
•	Burn all American heritage books; Destroy the red, white and blue;
•	Shred the U.S. Constitution; Defund and disband our military;
•	Eliminate free speech; Takeaway our guns.
America is in deep trouble
We’re on the Highway to a disaster,
Careening Out of Control!
•	The only true hope for America is a Tea Party takeover so we can put America back on course and stop the caveman politics, global communist takeover and the tom-foolery in Washington!
I hope you get what I am saying here. The world is falling apart because America is falling apart. Islamic terrorists smell the weakness in Obama—and they will take advantage to strike. The coming year the new president could face:
•
•	World holy war; Crash of the dollar; Wall Street failures; Unemployment hitting astronomical highs; Work force denigration; Nuclear War in the making.
It is up to the backbone of America to give US Citizens their dreams back and that backbone is YOU!
Resurgence of Liberty means the removal of global communism that is poisoning the blood stream of America and to restore our great heritage. No longer can we allow America to decay—the Tea Party must be the resistance.
No longer can we afford to sit in a circle and sing Kum-ba-yah. We must join forces and tell them “GET OUT, YOU’RE FIRED!”
Be The Resistance
The Tea Party must be a positive force for America. We must turn…..
•	Return decay into growth; Immorality into wholesome traditional values; Sick spiritually into Judeo/Christian values; Political ineptness into conservative government;
•	Economic disaster into thriving free-enterprise; fallen world stature into world leader.
How can we do this? Where does it start? Who shall be the leader? A Tea Party takeover must start with “We the People.” YOU are America’s greatest asset! This is what I am asking you to do. It won’t cost you a thing, but if only a few do this it could cost us our beloved nation. Are you ready? I am going to ask you to spread the word. It is that simple—just send this email to your friends. Give them the chance to save America, to step-up and say: “I’m with you. You can count on me!” It makes no difference if they are a member of some other organization or whether you think they’ll read this email or not. It is the only way that I know to build bulk to our movement.
Yes, we are millions strong, but in order for us to accomplish a complete and thorough take back and takeover of America we need tens of millions more to join the ranks—now. This is where you come in. Do you love your freedom enough to send this email to a few of your friends? Are you as mad as hell and not going to take it anymore? Say it now, “YES! YOU CAN COUNT ON ME!”
Now is the time, here is the plan, but only you can be the leader and take the action. Go to TEA PARTY.ORG and gain more evidence and make your own judgment?
Maybe you are too scared to step up and be counted. If so, I urge you to remember: The Obama zealots are demanding America get on her knees and kiss the rear of 3rd world countries begging for their forgiveness. They demand the U.S. apologize for our greatness and wallow in pity. The Washington Pharisees demand the U.S. repent for our sin of being too great, having too much, and giving too much. If the Obama Liberal Czars progressives grab America they will demand “We the People” plead for the world’s mercy, promise America will never be exceptional again.
As you read this email the Washington scallywags are seeking foolish guidance from the 3rd world leaders and bowing to all banana republic potentates. You know I’m telling the truth, because you have seen the photos.
You understand if the Tea Party fails the liberal progressives will demand and get America to:
•	Disarm; Throw open our borders; Delete our heritage; Lose our exceptionalism. KEEP PRESSING FOR THE OBHORRANT “Political Correctness”.
The world will demand our nation be divided, property seized for the greater good, the rich stripped of their wealth and dignity and some prosecuted for their open use of the free enterprise system. The media will be exalted into King-makers as wise sages of truth and world guidance. Heaven help us all. That’s not the world I want and I WILL RESIST, but will you? Are you with US? Can we count on you to vote against a President with irregularities in his past? I just have no idea what to think, but something stinks about Barack Obama and generally I am not a person who resorts to conspiracy theorists?

The New York Times best-selling author, featured TED speaker and one of the world’s leading cancer doctors and researchers are just a few of the ways to describe Dr. David Agus.
A Trojan since 2009, Agus is the director of the USC Norris Westside Cancer Center, director of the Center for Applied Molecular Medicine, professor of medicine at the Keck School of Medicine and professor of engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering. Though Agus is currently recognized as the authority on cancer research and treatment — having served as doctor for the likes of Steve Jobs, Lance Armstrong and Ted Kennedy — it was space exploration that inspired him to study science.
“I grew up during the Space Age when there was a lot of competition between the U.S. and Russia, and after the Russians sent the Sputnik to space, the government embarked on a major science education initiative,” he said. “Thus at a young age I caught the ‘science bug’ and decided I wanted to pursue a career in medicine.”
After graduating cum laude from Princeton University with a bachelor’s degree in molecular biology, Agus earned his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania and did his residency at Johns Hopkins University.
Agus said he decided to specialize in oncology because it allows him to directly apply what is done in the lab to the lives of real patients. According to Agus, the nature of his field forces him to be innovative, especially in treating late-stage cancer patients.
“In this field, you are able to take risks,” Agus said.
In addition to being a conventional doctor, Agus is on the front lines of developing ways to integrate technology into the fight against cancer. In 2006, he co-founded Navigenics, a company that provides people with their individual genetic information, allowing them to see their predispositions to certain diseases and to take appropriate preventative measures. He also founded Oncology.com, the Internet’s largest cancer resource and community.
Agus is a firm believer that the fight against cancer must focus on prevention.
“It must be a ‘ground up’ movement and start with individuals,” Agus said. “My book, The End of Illness, is an anthem of that.”
In The End of Illness, which spent over a month as The New York Times No. 1 bestseller after its January release, Agus argues that the key to curing cancer is preventing it in the first place. According to Fortune magazine, Agus calls for a completely new approach to medicine.
“I want doctors to treat toward health and not treat toward disease,” he said.
Agus said some simple ways to prevent cancer and other diseases include taking baby aspirin every day, keeping consistently active by walking from place to place and keeping a regular meal schedule.
“If you eat lunch at noon one day, but then 2 p.m. the next, your body releases stress hormones that make you up to 80 percent more likely to contract diabetes,” he said.
Though Agus is an internationally recognized figure who has done extensive work with many organizations and institutions, he said the opportunities and resources afforded him at USC are perfect for his work.
“I am all about the convergence of multiple sciences in developing technology for health care and USC is one of the only places where you can do that. The emphasis USC places on multi-disciplinary study and work is perfect for what I do,” Agus said. “USC was built on a long-term vision of changing the world and that’s what I’m about.”

The university’s new political initiative on campus, PolitiSCize, will kick off its campaign on Monday to increase student involvement in politics. The Political Student Assembly within USC’s Program Board, a branch of Undergraduate Student Government, developed the yearlong initiative that focuses on raising political awareness within the student body.
The organization hopes to strengthen and foster more student engagement in politics at USC culture.
“We want to see students paying attention to issues that affect them,” said Juan Espinoza, the executive director of Program Board and a senior majoring in communication and international relations. “We also want to engage students in how to work better with public policy and public officials in creating avenues and routes for action.”
To accomplish these goals, PolitiSCize is bringing politicians and opportunities for civic engagement directly to students. Ralph Nader, a former presidential candidate and independent political activist focused on humanitarian and environmental issues, will be on campus to speak to students on Monday.
A carnival-style event will also be held Tuesday on Trousdale Parkway where PolitiSCize members will register students to vote and offer information on fiscal policy education and propositions on the ballot.
A large and extended political initiative sponsored by a USC organization has not taken place on campus in recent history. Outside constituencies often come to campus in hopes of getting students to register to vote or support specific candidates.
Instead, PolitiSCize hopes to serve as a non-partisan outlet for students to gain information about politics in order to shape and make their own decisions. This could be particularly helpful considering that for most students this is the first election in which they have been legally eligible to participate.
Justin Bogda, a junior environmental studies and international relations major, is on the committee planning the PolitiSCize events. He stresses that the initiative’s unbiased focus will resonate with students.
“People’s decisions are often different when they’re not being pressured into anything and if they’re just presented with information instead of presented with just opinions. Their decisions will be dogmatic,” Bogda said. “I believe students should have the freedom to do so and the opportunity to do so.”
Students expect the initiative to be successful in encouraging the student body to become more engaged in the political arena.
“In college, it’s so easy to get too wrapped up in our academic lives,” said Anjali Shah, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering. “If you have students talking to students it’ll be more effective and it’s better than doing nothing.”
Students also believe that the initiative is important on campus because students can be apathetic about voting when they don’t see the relevance for their daily lives.
“In general I think that college students are indifferent because we feel we aren’t being directly affected by the laws that are being talked about,” Rhae Cisneros, an international relations major, said. “But the laws politicians are talking about already affect us. It’s our responsibility to become involved in these affairs.”
Some students consider college as an ideal setting to become more astute to the political arena.
“The purpose of college is learning how to be a functional citizen,” Carol Passarelli, a sophomore majoring in psychology and linguistics, said. “Focusing on political rights and obligations is an important part of that.”
Though PolitiSCize is currently working on events that raise interest for the upcoming presidential election, they want to continue providing information to student throughout the entire year.
“Next semester we want to stretch the boundaries on what politics are,” Bogda said. “Right now we’re focusing on elections and next semester we’re focusing on applying politics to a specific area or interest.”
Jessica Bellamy, a junior majoring in political science and member on the PolitiSCize committee, views the initiative as having the potential to transform the political culture on campus for the years to come.
“We want to continue politicizing ’SC so no one can say we have an apathetic or disengaged campus,” Bellamy said.
Where will he be speaking and what time?

Visitors trickled into Exposition Park early Sunday morning awaiting a glimpse of the 85-ton space shuttle Endeavour after its arrival at the California Science Center was delayed for more than 12 hours. By the time the shuttle turned into Exposition Park at around 11 a.m., a large crowd of families, students and residents had camped out with their cameras in a parking lot adjacent to Vermont Avenue.

Beginning early Friday morning, crews worked to transport the shuttle 12 miles from the Los Angeles International Airport to its permanent residence at the California Science Center in Exposition Park across from USC. The shuttle finally reached the museum just after 1 p.m.
An exhibit featuring the shuttle will open Oct. 30, according to Kenneth E. Phillips, the museum’s curator for aerospace science. The museum will also host “Spacefest,” an event featuring NASA experts and astronauts, from Oct. 30 to Nov. 4.
Originally, officials predicted the shuttle would arrive at Exposition Park between 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. Saturday evening. The shuttle, however, encountered a series of delays, which included obstacles such as trees and telephone poles.
After leaving late Saturday night, Shubham Sharma, a graduate student studying computer science, returned Sunday at 9:30 a.m. to spot the shuttle. Sharma said the shuttle is important for providing an example of how education can have a greater impact when it is applied to reality.
“We have to get in touch with the actual implementation of what we study in college so we have to get an up-close look at it,” Sharma said.
Similarly, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said the shuttle’s presence will encourage more students to pursue science-related careers.
“This is more than just a great part of our space program finding its resting home here in L.A. at the Science Center,” Villaraigosa said. “The shuttle Endeavour has inspired a new generation. Young kids — students on the schoolyard watching the shuttle Endeavour fly over the sky -— came back into their classrooms and said, ‘I want to be an astronaut. I want to be a scientist. I want to be an engineer.’”
The shuttle display will include an exhibit in the main California Science Center building, Phillips said.
The process of moving the shuttle cost about $10 million and was sponsored by the California Science Center foundation, Phillips said. The foundation paid NASA $14.5 million for the orbiter so they could prepare Endeavour for display.
Currently, the shuttle is resting horizontally in the display pavilion, which is located between the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Natural History Museum. By 2017, the museum plans to exhibit the shuttle vertically, although designs have not been decided, Phillips said.
Several parents said they came so their children could watch the shuttle slowly make its way to the Samuel Oschin Air and Space Shuttle Endeavour Display Pavilion.
“I wanted my kids to experience seeing the shuttle up close and personal,” said Edgar Flores, who lives near Exposition Park. “It’s a historic moment. They need to be involved in these sort of things.”
The  problem is the Row!
Gabriel imposter,
Give it up. You are just making yourself and the Greeks you purport to represent look foolish. If you disagree with anything I wrote in previous discussions, try a reasoned discussion.
I’m the real Gabriel.  You must be crazy.   Please leave me alone.
Both of you need to go away!  Nobody cares what you think “Gabriel”!
An affront to the poor, right here and worldwide, if ever there was one.
Shameful.

I’m not sure what you saw, but when I was out on MLK on Sunday, I saw quite the opposite.   It was a surreal experience.  There was an amazing number of people. It infused the local economy for sure…there were dozens of street vendors, and local restaurants were clearly booming. Everyone cheered as it went buy. There were dozens and dozens of tree trimming trucks, police, etc (John would have loved it). Most importantly everyone seemed to share a common pride in America…it needs to happen more often.  I saw online somewhere that LAPD had made zero arrests related to the event over the entire three days (they were literally everywhere, so it would have been hard to pull something).  There were people of all socioeconomic backgrounds – both those of lower income/education that reside in the local neighborhood, and those that traveled in to see it.  I don’t think anyone felt affronted or marginalized.  They felt proud to be Americans.
Hi. You misunderstood. I mean the space program, generally. This is an example o the excess and wasted money — we have money for this, and related missile defense/delivery related systems r&d — but no money for food, education, housing, and health care. Believe: those of us living in disadvantage would rather have food in our bellies than shuttles at some museum. Or in outer space.
I understand where you’re coming from.  Still, to argue the opposite point, NASA is a tiny sliver – only 0.3% – of the federal budget, so even if 100% of its funds were diverted, it would do little if anything to solve these other problems you mention.  I’d argue it’s an absolute bargain considering the great benefits that it has brought to society through the innovations that come from it.

The USC women’s volleyball team showed once again Friday that when it’s down, it’s not out.
The No. 6 Women of Troy, coming off a disappointing 3-0 sweep at the hands of Stanford on Wednesday night, rallied to defeat California 3-0 (25-22, 25-21, 25-20) on Friday night at Haas Pavilion, improving their record to 17-3 overall and 5-3 in Pac-12 action.
Freshmen duo · Samantha Bricio is not the only standout freshman for USC: Middle blocker Alicia Ogoms had five kills against Cal on Friday. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
“I’m really pleased; this is our hardest trip of the year,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “This is the fifth day we’ve been on the road, in the middle of the week, with midterms, too. They’re all very tired, so for them to come in here and win 3-0 is very, very good.”
Freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio, fresh off a Pac-12 Player of the Week award, paced the USC attack again with 14 kills and also added 12 digs to assist the defense. Senior opposite hitter Katie Fuller posted another double-double with 10 kills and 15 digs, while sophomore setter Hayley Crone recorded 10 digs to along with 39 assists.
“The 3-0 loss to Stanford really got into our heads, so everyone came today really focused and prepared,” Fuller said. “We executed a lot better than we did against Stanford and got the momentum back.”
The first set featured incredible back-and-forth action between the teams, with Cal jumping out in front to take a 10-8 lead. The Women of Troy took the lead at 12-11 after back-to-back kills by Crone and junior outside hitter Sara Shaw.
The Bears came back to take a 16-14 lead, but senior defensive specialist Erin Yoder notched USC’s third ace of the set to put the Women of Troy up 21-20. Four errors brought up match point, after which Fuller and freshman middle blocker Alicia Ogoms  made a tandem block to terminate the rally and take the set 25-22. Though hitting wasn’t a strong point for either team, the Bears struggled mightily with a .148 attacking percentage.
The Women of Troy blasted out of the gate in the second set, as five consecutive kills put them up 9-2. But Cal put forth a relentless attack to wipe out the deficit and knot things at 15 apiece.
After the Bears turned the tables and took a 20-17 lead, the Women of Troy rallied, with Bricio knocking down back-to-back kills and sophomore setter and opposite hitter Emily Young registering a third kill to give the Women of Troy a 23-21 lead. A Bricio kill sealed the frame at 25-21 for the Women of Troy, who improved to a .261 attacking clip while holding Cal to a mere .100 rate with ten kills.
The third set marked another strong start for the Women of Troy, who capitalized on consecutive aces by Yoder to jump ahead 6-2. Fuller turned back a Cal block to go up 11-5, and two crosscourt kills by Bricio gave the Women of Troy a seven-point advantage at 13-6. From that point, Cal never made a significant dent in the lead, as Fuller set up match point before a service error sealed the set 25-20 and the match for the Women of Troy.
“We served well against Stanford, and the people watching and reporting weren’t really fair with our effort, because we did some things really well,” Haley said. “Tonight, it was clear that we played well, and Cal brought their best game, so I’m pretty pleased with the team for that effort.”
The game marked the 12th time in 20 matches the Women of Troy swept an opponent, and the third set proved to be the best defensive effort for the team, as they held Cal to a match-low .079 rate with just nine kills.
The team will take advantage of the upcoming four-game homestand to recuperate.
“As we come back home, we just really want to work on our defense and execution,” Fuller said. “We need to maintain the momentum and work on our ball skills.”
The Women of Troy will battle Utah on Friday night before squaring off against Colorado on Sunday morning.
“We’re going to work on our offense, and put in a few new things in our offensive system,” Haley said. “We’re going to work very hard, but we’ve got to shorten the practices because of midterms, and we’re hoping we can be good enough to win next weekend.”

SEATTLE — When the Trojans defeated the Huskies on Saturday night at CenturyLink Field, it marked the halfway mark of USC’s regular season. USC stands at 5-1, with that lone loss coming at the hands of Stanford. Of those six games, the Trojans played just two at home, meaning that four of their last six will be played at the friendly confines of the Coliseum.
The season hasn’t necessarily gone as planned for the No. 11 Trojans; everyone was expecting a team that was going to score 50 points a game and blow out opponents. Nevertheless, the Trojans are still in the title hunt and control their own destiny. With six games left, here is what we have learned:
Marqise Lee is USC’s best player
With no offense to senior quarterback Matt Barkley, who is having a solid season (16 touchdowns, six interceptions), sophomore receiver Marqise Lee is the best player on this year’s USC team.
Lee is by far the team’s best playmaker: He makes people miss every time he catches a pass. He is also clutch: He makes plays when the offense is struggling, best exemplified by his 83-yard touchdown grab against Utah. And perhaps most importantly, he is a team player: He throws crushing blocks for fellow wide receiver Robert Woods on screens. He does not complain when the ball isn’t thrown his way. And, he plays special teams, returning kickoffs with the best of them.
I wrote earlier this season that Woods was still USC’s top receiver, and I’ll stick to that. In terms of being a pure receiver with great hands and superb route running, Woods is top dog. But as a football player and playmaker, Lee is second to none.
Silas Redd is the featured back
Though senior Curtis McNeal does get a fair share of carries, the job belongs to junior running back Silas Redd. Redd got his first start of the season against Washington and responded with a 155-yard performance, including a 57-yard dash on USC’s first offensive play. Going into the season, it looked as if the two backs would split carries 50-50; that does not look to be the case anymore. Redd has gotten the bulk of the carries the last few weeks, and with Saturday’s performance in Seattle, I think he solidified himself as “the man” in the backfield.
The defensive line is the defense’s strongest unit.
Led by junior sack master Morgan Breslin, the Trojans’ defensive line has wreaked havoc on opponents. Saturday was the perfect example, as the unit sacked Washington quarterback Keith Price five times, 1.5 of which came from Breslin. As a team, the Trojans have 22 sacks. Freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams, sophomore defensive tackle George Uko, senior defensive end Wes Horton and Breslin have been playing great football over the last few weeks. When senior defensive end Devon Kennard went down, many thought this was the weak link for USC, but that has not been the case. They’ve held up their end of the deal.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with Matt Barkley
This is the most important thing to take out of the season thus far. Barkley was expected to put up massive numbers given the fact he threw 39 touchdowns in 2011. It hasn’t gone as everyone expected, but Barkley has still put up modest stats. He has 16 touchdown passes, meaning he is on pace to throw more than 30 again. Yes, he has six interceptions in 2012, which everyone is making a fuss about because he threw just seven last year. People forget, however, that through six games last season, Barkley’s touchdown:interception ratio was 16:4; The numbers from 2011 and 2012  are almost the same.
A lot of Barkley’s so-called struggling is because of playcalling. Quite frankly, Barkley hasn’t really had many chances to make plays down the field. The Trojans have been conservative, opting to run the ball and throw screens rather than try for huge chunks of yardage. This hasn’t allowed Barkley to get into any sort of rhythm, and that lack of rhythm has led to inconsistency.
It is also safe to say that in 2011, although he only threw seven interceptions, there were several others that could have been intecepted. It isn’t farfetched to say he really probably threw 11 or 12. So when you look at it, the numbers aren’t on pace to be that different from last year.
He hasn’t had many “great games” where he has thrown six touchdowns, but he has been solid. And most importantly, he is willing to use an audible to run plays when his passing game isn’t there. He is a selfless player, and allows the team to run the ball as much as they need to. If the playbook opens back up, his numbers will soar.
USC has a long way to go
Anyone who has watched this team plays knows it is far from perfect. The offense has been stagnant at times, and the defense, which has looked good for the most part, has given up big plays to let teams back into the game. The special teams have been inconsistent as well, with sophomore kicker Andre Heidari missing more field goals in six games this year than he did all of his first season. They commit a lot of penalties and have mental lapses. They really have yet to play a complete game. But the pieces are there for them to make a run.
There is no single reason that the Trojans can’t win the rest of their games, but they are going to have to clean things up if they want to hold that crystal ball in January.

In uncharacteristic fashion, USC stumbled out of the gate on Saturday afternoon, allowing No. 9 Loyola Marymount to jump out to a 1-0 lead that held up through the end of the first quarter.
The No. 1 Trojans kept their composure and recovered quickly, however, routing the Lions 13-6.

“We missed some open looks early,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “We just need to do a better job in starting the game with a little more focus. I think a couple of players maybe took the game a little too lightly. We were a little too relaxed. But we got it going in the second quarter.”
In the second quarter, the Trojans began their scoring onslaught with a goal from their most prolific scorer, junior driver Nikola Vavic.
Led by redshirt sophomore goalie Ely Bonilla, the defense battened down the hatches and shut out LMU during the first period, and a total of five different players netted goals for USC to give the team a 5-1 lead heading into halftime.
“Our defense did a good job,” Jovan Vavic said. “We made some big stops in 5-on-6 defense when we needed to. Ely did a very good job.”
Power play execution was the key in the second quarter, as sophomore driver Marc Vonderweidt and senior two-meter Matt Burton each converted on 6-on-5 chances. Goals by freshman two-meter Mac Carden and sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias pushed the lead to four goals.
Jovan Vavic praised his third rotation in particular, which he described as his “thirteen through seventeen” players on the depth chart.
“Our third rotation did a great job,” Jovan Vavic said. “They did an excellent job in playing with much more energy than our first and second units and gave us the lead.”
In the second half, the Trojans struck first with Nikola Vavic’s second goal of the game. Following an LMU goal that broke a 6-0 scoring run, Vavic struck again with a goal that would start another USC run. Burton tallied his second goal of the day thanks to a pass from the younger Vavic and junior driver Stephen Siri joined the scoring action to push the lead to 8-2.
Following another LMU goal, USC capped off the busy third quarter with goals from Genidounias and sophomore driver Rex Butler to give the Trojans an 11-3 lead going into the fourth quarter.
The final frame featured five goals total — three for LMU and two for USC. Carden scored his second of the game and junior utility Mace Rapsey tacked one on, becoming the eighth different player to score for the Trojans.
Though Jovan Vavic was pleased with the way his team responded after falling behind, he expressed displeasure with the team’s subpar effort and indicated that changes to the lineup could come if their play did not improve.
“We have a very competitive group of guys,” Jovan Vavic said. “Some of the guys who played well this past game are excited and fired up about getting back to training. The guys who were a little lackadaisical on Friday will have to pick it up or they are going to lose some playing time.”
The Trojans’ next game is Friday against Long Beach State in Long Beach, Calif. at 7 p.m.

SEATTLE — What began Saturday night as a likely blowout entering halftime evolved into a fourth-quarter barn burner before a sold-out CenturyLink Field crowd. No. 11 USC, however, escaped with a 24-14 victory on the strength of junior running back Silas Redd’s 26 carries for 155 yards.
Stiff-armed · Junior running back Silas Redd now boasts 570 yards rushing on the season after running for 155 yards Saturday against Washington. Halfway through 2012, he’s on pace for his second straight 1,000-yard season. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“Any time you go on the road and you come into what seemed like a sold-out environment, it’s a very hard place to play,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “Obviously, the Seahawks have success over here. Washington has been undefeated here.”
On USC’s first offensive play, Redd established the ground game, originally running to his left then, finding no daylight, exhibited great patience and reversing field on his way to a 57-yard gain.
“It was designed to the left, but it was kind of plugged up,” Redd said of the play. “I saw an opening to the right and I took it.”
But the Trojans (5-1, 3-1) were unable to capitalize on a first-and-goal from the 9-yard line and settled for a 23-yard field goal by sophomore kicker Andre Heidari.
After limiting Washington to a three-and-out on its first defensive series, USC forced a turnover on the second, with sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey snaring his fourth interception of the season on a short crossing route, setting the Trojans up at the Huskies’ 36-yard line.
USC capitalized on Washington’s miscue, as Redd punched in an 11-yard touchdown, giving the Trojans a 10-0 lead.
“Our defense was really getting after the quarterback, and you know they were pretty beat up on their offense,” Kiffin said. “Every game is not going to be like that, and we will need to score more.”
With 7:15 remaining in the first quarter, USC squandered an opportunity to expand its 10-point lead, as senior quarterback Matt Barkley threw his sixth interception of the season at midfield.
Barkley, who finished 10 for 20 with 167 yards, never seemed to find his rhythm, especially in a second half in which he completed just three of 10 passes.
“They didn’t want to get beat over the top [with] the threats that we have with Marqise and Robert, and so they played very deep and played a lot of two-high defenses and just kind of forced us to run the ball, and we ran the ball very well,” Barkley said of his uncharacteristically low number of passing attempts.
Washington proceeded to drive the ball 58 yards on eight plays, scoring on a 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Kasen Williams, on which Washington’s leading receiver exploited his considerable height advantage over junior cornerback Nickell Robey. But outside this touchdown, Robey largely limited Williams in their one-on-one matchups, allowing only one other reception for five yards and locking him down overall.
To begin the second quarter, sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee converted a third-and-5 with a 24-yard reception on the first pass thrown his way. Later in the drive, Barkley threw a 16-yard dart through double-coverage to sophomore tight end Xavier Grimble for a touchdown.
Before time expired in the half, sophomore cornerback Anthony Brown blocked a punt on Washington’s 21-yard line, recovered it and rumbled into the end zone, giving USC a 24-7 lead entering halftime. The play came from an unlikely source, as Brown has been relegated to fourth-string cornerback after beginning the season as the starter opposite Robey.
“We did a great job at getting turnovers the whole game, and we needed to get the offense the ball,” Robey said. “That’s championship ‘D’ right there.”
On the Trojans’ second possession of the third quarter, Washington cornerback Desmond Trufant blocked Heidari’s 41-yard field goal attempt, beating USC’s line off the right edge. Trufant also played stellar lockdown defense on Lee for most of the night, limiting USC’s speedster to two catches for 32 yards.
Washington rode the momentum of the clutch special teams play, scoring a touchdown on its subsequent possession with a 29-yard touchdown strike to tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins. With the completion, quarterback Keith Price punctuated a streak in which he completed 15 consecutive passes after starting the game with three straight incompletions.
“It’s just the little things that you saw last week — just with the penalties and [the lack of discipline],” Barkley responded when asked about why USC couldn’t cushion its lead in the second half. “If we play undisciplined, we’re not going to have a blowout game.”
The Huskies relinquished their budding momentum on their next offensive possession, however, as Price fumbled on USC’s three-yard line after USC senior safety Jawanza Starling leveled a vicious hit on the quarterback. Starling also recovered the football.
“It’s a testament to how we have been practicing,” Starling said of the four turnovers USC’s defense forced in the contest. “It is just a more experienced defense than a couple of years ago and we have been in the system for a while and the guys know what they are supposed to do.”
USC would claim two more turnovers in the game’s waning moments, with sophomore cornerback Josh Shaw nabbing his second interception of the season on a tipped pass and freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams recovering a fumble with three minutes remaining.
“We are glad to get out of here [with the win],” Kiffin said. “It’s been a long first half of the season, four road games out of six; we’re back in L.A. for five of the next six, and we’ll load up and get back.”
The road-weary Trojans return home to the Coliseum this Saturday against Colorado for a 3 p.m. game.

Midterm season is one of the more frustrating and stressful times of the school year for students. On top of all the homework, extracurriculars, jobs and internships that students have to juggle, taxing exams represent yet another challenge to students’ balancing acts.
Preparing for midterms usually consists of reading and re-reading textbooks and notes or mechanically practicing intricate math and science problems — tasks that can quickly get tiresome.
Study update · Students prepare for midterms in Leavey Library. Though reviewing class notes and practicing in-class essays are classic ways to succeed on midterms, iPhone apps put a modern spin on the studying process. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
But, thanks to technology, studying does not have to be tedious. Educational apps can quickly transform a sleep-inducing study session into an engaging and meaningful learning experience.
For those who are required to write in-class essays as part of their midterms, VocabWiz can expand vocabularies enough to thoroughly impress professors. VocabWiz has more than 4,500 words and is specifically catered to college students, even offering vocabulary relevant to the TOEFL, GRE and the GMAT exams. Brush up on some of these words using VocabWiz and you won’t have to worry running into a word you’ve never seen before during a test.
When it comes to analyzing dense passages, there is no need to agonize. Looking up obscure words has never been easier with Dictionary.com’s official app. With more than 2 million definitions for words, this app becomes especially handy when reading a particularly technical paper or novel. And in case a definition is not sufficient, the Dictionary.com app also comes with example sentences, word origin and history for every word as well as a feature that allows users to shake their iPhone for a random word  — just for kicks.
If it seems smartphone apps are partial toward the humanities, think again. The Free Graphing Calculator app, for instance, is every mathematician’s dream. Straightforward and precise, this app works as a scientific calculator, graphing calculator, unit converter and more. The app includes scientific constants and formulas for topics ranging from trigonometry to classical mechanics, useful for studying or just to look up when an answer is not coming to mind. Though the calculator cannot be used during a test, the app works as a study tool as well as a resource for checking graphs and answers.
In terms of science, the chemistry realm boasts Molecules, a brilliant application for viewing three-dimensional images of molecules. As an open source project, Molecules works not only as a molecular databank but also as a continually growing project that gives large visual representations of small-scale particles.
Taking a music class? If it deals with the fundamentals of music theory, the Scales & Modes app might be a valuable purchase in the long-run. Major and minor modes are displayed on a musical staff and one can listen to every note in any key. Musical scales are also available for viewing and listening. Scales & Modes makes reviewing the basics less of a chore and more of a reward.
When it comes to the pure memorization of facts and information, there is no better way to study than with flashcards. But why go through all the trouble of actually buying notecards and spending time making them when there is the A+ Flashcards Pro application? A+ Flashcards Pro allows users to download existing flashcard sets from Quizlet, a popular learning resource website; create sets complete with text, images and audio; incorporate languages with Microsoft Translation and Online Search; share sets with friends and much more. A+ Flashcards Pro is an application appropriate for just about any subject.
Of course, no study session is complete without a study break. Try your hand at Roo Run Roo, a simple and unique game that has quick, short levels, or Beat Sneak, a graphically stunning puzzle and maze. Drool over some delectable photos of food with apps like Gojee, which also offers users delicious recipes, or Epicurious. Maybe even take a few shameless selfies of yourself with the PopBooth or CatPaint apps. Just make sure to keep these limited breaks in check.
Still, even though these apps help ease the pain of studying, it is important not to become completely dependent on them. Though technology is convenient and accessible, nothing can truly replace group study sessions or studying in advance for a midterm. It might be cliche, but make sure to get some rest and eat a hearty breakfast before your test — and do not get too carried away with CatPaint.
Every student usually has stressful times with midterm season and so do I. I have a small tip that helps me pass this difficulty. It is Superflashcard for app. This app includes many contents relating: GMAT, TOEFL, GRE,etc. Superflashcard is very convenient and accessible with great database and smart flashcards. You can share with your friends at: www.superflashcard.com
The part I have found interesting is the use of flashcards in this App – i think i’ll definitely look into this, on my specific topics, especially for studying for exams.

It’s October and that can (obviously) mean only one thing: Trojan Family Weekend. What has become your sanctuary from parental supervision — the place where you can go wild on the weekends and barely survive the workweek — will now be infiltrated by mothers, fathers and whomever else wants to tag along.
Whether you’re from out of state or the ‘rents are just coming down the 405 Freeway, this weekend is a big deal. You’ll have to prove to your parents that you’re actually managing to function on your own, without their watchful eye and expert guidance.
Somehow, between the time that you graduated high school and the minute you stepped on campus, you underwent a transformation: That awkward, irresponsible kid your parents once knew blossomed into an overachieving, socially acceptable college success story. Now is your chance to show off.
Preparing for the inevitable inspection of your residence is essential. Unless you’re an abnormality who actually wouldn’t be embarrassed if your parents saw the natural state of your room, it’s time to get down to business.
Aside from the heavy cleaning that your bedroom, kitchen and bathroom will receive, you have to hide the extensive alcohol and condom stash, clean out your fridge and actually do some laundry. Equally important is removing any random articles of clothing lying around that aren’t yours; trying to explain this is a subject that’s more trouble than it’s worth. The Friday afternoon parent and student seminar, “Relationships and Hooking Up,” was cancelled for a reason.
Strategically lay out a few open books, making it seem as if you study whenever possible. This will at least partially alleviate the constant parental fear that their son or daughter isn’t doing his or her schoolwork. Now that you’re in college, this fear is probably not unfounded — but appearances must be kept up if you want this visit to go smoothly.
As for scheduled events on campus, you will never be lacking in an activity to engage your parents and make them feel more informed about your university experience. There are events occurring from Thursday to Sunday that cater to every interest possible. An event calendar is available online for any planning you and your parents wish to do, but keep in mind that they are all part of a registered weekend program that must be done in advance.
President C. L. Max Nikias makes his annual Address to Trojan Families on Friday at 1 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium — definitely an event that shouldn’t be missed by visitors.
Tailgating at the football game against Colorado will also be another highlight of the weekend. Football games are an integral part of the USC experience and even if your parents are Coliseum regulars, it’s still a great bonding opportunity for a Trojan family.
The suggestions page for what to do in Los Angeles on the website for Trojan Family Weekend is surprisingly well-equipped. There are some standard options, such as the Santa Monica Pier and Griffith Observatory, but also some lesser-known attractions that are fun as well, such as Downtown’s Olvera Street — where you can display your lower-division Spanish language proficiency at Mr. Churro — or the live but suburban charms of Old Town Pasadena.
Finding places to take your family is primarily a worry for students who aren’t from the immediate area, but if you really want to impress your family, showing them offbeat L.A. spots as opposed to common tourist destinations will show off your expert assimilation into the Los Angeles community. And even if your family is from Southern California, pre-planned non-campus activities are nice ways to re-connect with family members away from the academic environment of school.
The friend dinner is a staple of Parents Weekend. When your family visits, they will undoubtedly want to meet the new, amazing people you’ve met since you left home — which means you must carefully select who you choose to bring to dinner. Now’s the time to leave your drug-addled, drunken friends behind and bring forth the studious, extracurricular-obsessed pals you met during class.
In all seriousness, though, the friends you introduce to your family will say a lot about how you’ve been spending your time at college. Friends, in any situation, are a reflection upon some aspect of your own character, so keep this in mind when selecting the group that will accompany you and your family to dinner.
Having your family visit you at college can be stressful. It might feel like an intrusion on the life you’ve created away from home, or you might worry that your parents will only question you about your future career and what you’re doing with all that free time. But it’s also important to treat this weekend as an opportunity to allow your parents to view you as an adult, as someone capable of surviving — dare we say thriving — away from home.

“Classic” is a strong word. It means that a piece of art can last forever, that it can stand on its own and be remembered and revered long after its release. As such, the term “classic”  should be reserved for those special pictures that truly live up to the meaning.
But when trying to describe Summit Entertainment’s Sinister, even the word “classic” does not seem strong enough. Directed by Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) and produced by Jason Blum (the Paranormal Activity franchise), this thriller, starring Ethan Hawke, might not only be the scariest film of the decade, but could very well be the best horror flick of all time. It is simply that good.

Sinister’s methodical character development separates the film from other entries in the genre. The beginning of the film devotes itself entirely to this aspect — nothing evil or exciting takes place for a significant period of time. This allows viewers to get to know Hawke’s character and his family.
Hawke plays a true crime novelist named Ellison, who moves into a rural Pennsylvania house with his wife, son and younger daughter. He has not had a successful novel in years and he desperately seeks the fame he enjoyed in the early days of his career. This desperation has led him to purchase the new house without telling his wife or children why it was such a bargain: Because of its treacherous history, in which a family was hanged in the backyard while the youngest daughter went missing, never to be found again.
Ellison decides to use this haunting story as source material for his new book, but the movie takes a turn for the worse when Ellison discovers a box of Super 8 film reels in the attic of the new house, which show not just the apparent supernatural hanging of the previous owners but also the murders of more families dating back several decades.
What then follows is a film so delicately timed and calculated that it achieves absolute horror perfection. Derrickson knows how to build up dread, sustain an aura of mystery and masterfully allow Ellison’s world to come crashing down before viewers’ eyes.
The techniques that appear in Sinister are not new, but because the film executes them so well, they appear groundbreaking. As Ellison stumbles around the house late at night investigating strange noises, the suspense becomes almost unbearable. Sinister harbors the kind of toe-curling dread that makes viewers dig their fingernails into the armrests and plead for something to happen just to get it over with.
And an event, almost always, occurs in those scenes, one so bone chilling that it can silence an entire theater stuffed to capacity. These moments are made even more intense just by the simple fact that viewers become so invested in the characters.
Ethan Hawke, in his first horror film, delivers a knockout performance, allowing the audience to experience his character’s desperation for fame and the struggle between balancing that desire with the goal of providing for his family. Viewers are let into an intimate window that shows a crumbling marriage and a wife, played tremendously by Juliet Rylance, who is at her breaking point.
Hawke and Rylance’s theater backgrounds allow them to captivate audiences, especially during their argumentative scenes, which are filmed almost exclusively as one single shot. Sinister does not make use of multiple angles or cameras; instead, the two acting powerhouses hold the audience’s attention with pure skill.
The secondary characters are just as enjoyable, with Law and Order’s Vincent D’Onofrio making a cameo as a professor who helps Ellison understand the pagan god causing all the destruction depicted in the Super 8 footage.
Perhaps the most memorable character, however, is a star-struck deputy, played by James Ransone, who tries to impress Ellison throughout the whole film. The script, mostly by way of this character, ends up providing several unexpectedly laugh-out-loud scenes that make for a nice break from the scary moments.
But those breaks are few and far between once the action revs up. Sinister runs like a diesel engine: The film has a slow beginning serving as a warm up that leads into the final horrifying acts that follow.
This is no teenage horror picture with cheap scares; this mature piece intends to terrify audiences right to their very cores. Sinister does not get its R-rating because of profanity, sex or gore. Instead, the film gets it from “disturbing violent images and some terror,” according to the Motion Picture Association of America.
“Some terror” is an understatement. Sinister packs its runtime with the exact things that nightmares are made of: helplessness, confusion, violence, otherworldly forces and, of course, children at the center of it all. Derrickson’s shots convey this perfectly, and are contrasted nicely with the hair-raising Super 8 footage that adds in another layer of undeniable creepiness.
If 2007’s Paranormal Activity made low-budget horror films mainstream and 2010’s Insidious made old school horror seem alive and well, Sinister is the bastard love child of the two. By combining the best elements from these films, the entire team behind Sinister has created the crowning achievement of the horror genre.
Calling the film a “classic” just doesn’t cut it.
There is no way I am going to see this movie alone now!!  Fantastic review Nick!

When professionals have inhabited a certain role in the film industry for decades, they often find the need to try their hand at something more challenging. Frequently, a producer or visual effects designer will attempt a somewhat smooth transition into directing his or her own projects.
Occasionally though, an actor or actress will make the more drastic jump from performance in front of the camera to supervision behind the frame. Renowned actors like Woody Allen and Clint Eastwood have found tremendous success in direction, leading to the production of multiple classic movies and Oscar hardware.

More recently, commercial actors like George Clooney and Ben Affleck have chosen a seat in the director’s chair, in addition to accepting a leading role. In Argo, the two creatives unify their storytelling talents, with Clooney as producer and Affleck as star and director. Clooney’s production talents are certainly felt, but Affleck commands this film from start to finish.
The story behind Argo is so ridiculous and partly comical at first glance, it’s hard to imagine that screenwriter Chris Terrio based it on real CIA operations. During the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iranian protestors seized the U.S. embassy, taking 66 Americans hostage. But there’s a lesser-known side of the story: Before the revolutionaries invaded the safe haven, six workers managed to escape out a back exit. Taking refuge in the home of a Canadian ambassador, the six Americans waited months for the U.S. government to help them escape the country safely. The special forces unit of the CIA faced a difficult task: to return the hostages safely to U.S. soil all without attracting notice from revolutionary forces.
To solve this conundrum, specialist Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) constructed the plan of having the stranded Americans pose as a Canadian film crew scouting locations. In order to “fake” the authenticity of his film, Mendez travelled to Hollywood and developed a science-fiction spectacular. Thrilling action and surprisingly light comedy ensue as the audience remains on the edge of their collective seat, desperately hoping the six refugees survive.
After an excellent directing debut in Gone Baby Gone and an equally successful directing and acting in the action drama, The Town, Affleck asserted himself as not only one of the best actors-turned-director, but an elite filmmaker period. Whereas his first two films were set in Boston, Affleck’s hometown, the setting of Argo is much more complex, jumping between Iran, Washington, D.C. and Hollywood. Affleck’s lack of familiarity with location is barely noticed: The stories in each location feel perfectly genuine for the time and place. Affleck works with the strongly connected nature of Terrio’s script, which seamlessly moves between stories. In addition, the film mirrors the social characteristics of rebellion and protest of the ’70s through vintage costumes and a unique visual style.
But Argo succeeds mainly through excellent performances from the entire cast.
Amazingly, Affleck manages to illuminate the best traits of each actor’s capabilities. Bryan Cranston, who plays CIA head Jack O’Donnell, moves across the entire spectrum of emotional as the film progresses to its conclusion. In early scenes, O’Donnell is humorously inept at his responsibilities; however, by the climatic ending, he’s forceful and defiant.
Affleck and Terrio also contrast the dramatic portrayals of Mendez and O’Donnell with the hilarious inclusion of John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), two Hollywood executives who agree to help Mendez create the phony film.
Both Goodman and Arkin play their characters perfectly. Mendez, as well as the audience, journeys to Hollywood with prejudiced preconceptions of these eccentric executives — and Chambers and Siegel are everything Mendez could have imagined and more. Siegel comes off as demanding and cocky, lavishly adorned with fancy clothes, jewelry and a gold-painted car. And Terrio gives Arkin several excellent lines of dialogue that one can’t help but continuously quote after the film ends. Arkin injects Siegel with grumpy outer characteristics laid over a caring, honest core. With his strong portrayal in Argo, Arkin is sure to be a contender in the best supporting actor award category.
As this is Affleck’s film, it would be remiss to not analyze his take on the protagonist Mendez. Affleck’s portrayal of Mendez effectively guides the film through its broad plot and intellectual themes without demanding the complete attention of the audience. Affleck’s performance is understated, but not at all underwhelming. The combination of these four actors (Affleck, Cranston, Goodman and  Arkin) defines Argo and makes it the excellent film that it is.
With a story as unbelievable as the one in Argo, the line between parodying history and paying homage to past events is so thin and permeable that finding the best format for a film can be difficult. Despite this daunting task, Affleck mixes comedy and intense drama in a way few films dare nowadays; even in tight emotional moments illustrating the horror of the revolution, Affleck somehow engineers feelings of laughter. The impeccable balance of these two emotions is a testament to Terrio’s outstanding adapted screenplay and Affleck’s skill as a director.
It’s quite difficult to find any flaws with Argo. Aesthetically, some visual effects might be poorly animated and slightly jarring, and the emotional and political impact of themes are not quite as powerful as one might hope. Yet, these are minor gripes in a film that is perhaps the best this year so far and will definitely be discussed come awards season.

Four years ago, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama’s concept of hope and change fascinated America. As a captivating politician with a new style and rhetoric, this young senator from Illinois provided a fresh outlook for the future of American politics.
The 2012 election season carries a vastly different feel. With as many advertisements as money can buy, frequent fundraisers with celebrities and non-stop solicitations for contributions, both presidential candidates’ campaigns revolve almost entirely around money.
Between the skyrocketing costs of elections, the Citizens United Supreme Court decision in 2010 that allows corporations newfound power over political contributions and the ever-growing number of deep-pocketed super PACs and outside backers, the American political process is controlled by a select group of people with more money and power than the average voter could ever dream of.
The highest-stakes race of all —the presidential election between Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney — is not immune to this trend. This election is all about fact-checking the candidates’ claims and a constant flow of slanderous advertisements paid for by super PACs and outside groups. In such an environment, it becomes crucial for voters — especially students, who have the potential to make a real difference in a very close election — to make an active effort be aware of who is contributing money to the campaigns and what impact that has on the information voters receive.
Take, for instance, the recent presidential debate and its focus on tax policy. Obama contended Romney’s tax plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut while Romney countered that it simply wasn’t true. In the following days, the Obama campaign aired an advertisement insinuating that Romney was lying and the Romney campaign shot back that the Obama ad was misleading and inaccurate. As fact-checking organizations can attest, it would not have been the first time that either candidate said something inaccurate.
The question of which candidate is right about Romney’s tax plan is not what voters should be asking. They should be thinking about the bigger problem: the power of politicians and the influence they yield, as well as their ability to bombard the public with their side of any issue, drawing rigid, detrimental lines between people and parties. Since when did a political debate require live-stream fact-checking and advertisements about lying instead of a genuine exchange of ideas that help voters better decide who to vote for?
The narrative of this election cycle has not only been dominated by debate over which candidate has made more false claims, but which one can raise the most money. So far, Obama has raised $690.1 million and Romney close to $633 million, according to The New York Times.
On top of that, outside spending has skyrocketed and further fueled the campaign ad fire. Super PACs that support Romney spent $84.6 million as of Sept. 28 and dropped $2 million on campaign ads attacking Obama in the last two weeks of September, according to The Business Journal. Priorities USA Action, a super PAC created by two former Obama aides, has spent $5.1 million on anti-Romney ads. This money could instead be put to use reforming the American education system, Social Security, health care or any number of the United States’ most important yet most under-funded systems.
Of course, the concept that campaign contributions would be spent elsewhere is a pipe dream. The reality is that even more money will be spent in this election, and it will be spent to twist, distort and manipulate the truth. Most importantly, though, it will be used to try to sway voters. Fact-checking websites and the media provide a way for voters to see what is legitimate and what is not in politics. But voters must make an active effort to pay attention to these sources and who is funding political untruths just as much as the candidates themselves.
In a world so driven by money, it can be forgotten that the end outcome of all the ads and campaigning is ultimately determined by voters. It is no secret that college students can play a major role in presidential elections, as we saw in 2008. But with this power comes a responsibility to challenge accepted truths, to dig beyond bashing campaign ads and the money behind them to find out which candidate they want to lead the country for the next four years.
During election season, it is the politician’s job to convince voters that he or she is the right choice, and it is the voter’s job to figure out which candidate is the wrong one.

The future of race-based college admissions once again lies in the hands of U.S. Supreme Court justices, who are currently considering a case challenging the University of Texas at Austin for its inclusion of race as a factor in the admissions process. The case, Fisher v. The University of Texas at Austin,was brought by a Caucasian applicant, Abigail Fisher, who was rejected by UT in 2008 and is now claiming that the university discriminated against her based on her race in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
If the court were to rule in Fisher’s favor, against the university’s current policy of race-based affirmative action, their decision would be a victory for equality of opportunity for all hard-working citizens, regardless of the color of their skin. This would effectively move society closer toward an age in which people are truly judged based on the content of their character.
Last Wednesday, the justices began deliberating over affirmative action’s constitutionality, hearing oral arguments from both parties. A ruling that agrees with Fisher could lead to the adoption of race-neutral policies in public universities across the nation and for the sake of integrity and fairness in universities and the rest of society, the court must do so.
The court must consider how the UT Austin admissions process works and if it is constitutional. A state law mandates that all Texas high school seniors who rank in the top 10 percent of their class are accepted. The remaining applicants are considered based on traditional factors such as grades, standardized test scores, extracurricular activities — and race.  UT defends its use of race-based admissions as a means to diversify its student body. Affirmative action has long served that beneficial purpose.
But college is a time when young people should be recognized for their positive attributes and potential contributions to the world, whatever color their skin might be. Emphasizing race as a factor of admission reduces applicants to mere statistics, re-drawing the very color lines that affirmative action aims to dissolve. Race is not, nor will it ever be, an accurate predictor of the contributions an applicant would make if accepted to a university.
An additional harm is that race-based affirmative action promotes the myth that individuals of historically disadvantaged backgrounds need the government as their protector and caretaker. These policies keep individuals dependent on the government for success rather than free them from discrimination. This fosters continued divisions along racial lines, focusing on the physical appearance of individuals instead of emphasizing their accomplishments.
To accept an applicant who is less qualified than another because he or she is a member of an ethnic minority contradicts what universities stand for, especially in a country that values hard work and is expected to award individuals based on merit.
If America is to move into a truly post-racism age in which people do not group themselves into narrow categories of ethnicity, the court must rule that UT’s policy is unconstitutional.
As America advances into an age of globalization, it remains counterintuitive and anachronistic to still be hung up on racial identification. Affirmative action policies keep the wounds of inequalities fresh, creating an endless cycle of racial tensions that detract attention from who individuals are beyond their skin color.
The decision made in this case could do one of two things: continue discriminatory policies in university admissions and remain rooted in a close-minded past, or move society forward toward a future that emphasizes true equality of opportunity.
Only once this paradigm shift occurs will the United States will break in to a post-racism era in where people are rewarded for their character and achievements rather than for surface-level and predetermined qualities such as skin color. There is no better place for this to take place than the nation’s universities, and the Supreme Court must make the decision that will spark this crucial shift.

For those against Affirmative Action: Can you think of a similar system that benefits Whites?
I’ll give you one, the Legacy system at many private universities. 
20% of admitted and attending students at USC are Legacy’s while only 14% are the first in their family to go to college — and these figures are low compared to other universities.
Segregation was not that long ago folks! As a result there is a huge disparity between Whites and people of color when it comes to being admitted to a university as a Legacy student. A clear example of institutional racism.
This also applies for those of you speaking about merit. By now everyone knows that the only reason former President Bush was admitted into Yale was because his father went there too — Yes, George W. was a Legacy student. 
If even the though of Affirmative Action angers you, then you should be outraged at the Legacy system. It’s been around much longer and it benefits one race (and class) over any other.
Sarah Cueva, I just gave you a great topic to write about. Now go on, do your research, and post the demographics of Scions at USC. Then tell us how the legacy system is fair, but affirmative action is not. /sarcasm
An excellent article. The “Open Minded” crowd need to READ & CONSIDER what is being said here.
When will these stubborn folk EVER transcend their skin color? Is it really just because they are innately LAZY?
affirmative action = pity invite
It’s sad that these debates still exist in our society today.   Although I appreciate Susette’s comments and concerns above I can’t disagree with her more.  I’ve walked on the USC campus numerous times over the previous couple of years and it appears that diversity is alive and well at that campus.  It appears to be a true melting pot culture with the best of the best represented from all ethnic backgrounds.  I don’t know if this Fisher in Texas had the grades to get in that school or not but the fact remains that race should not be a factor in accepting or eliminating someones college opportunities.  My child is Latino but I certainly don’t want people looking at her as if she received admission onto that campus, in part, because of the color of her skin.  I think that perception has a negative effect on anyones psychology when they feel that their success may be tied to race.
Sarah, look around USC. Geographically it sits in an area that its student body does not reflect. After a day watching national college football you can see crowd shots of predominantly white fans. Even with years of affirmative action policies in place, the American college campus to me seems no more diverse than when I attended USC in the 70s.  Why do you think the government had to step in in the first place? Because of unfair admissions policies which discriminated against students based on race.
This movement afoot to keep government from protecting the relatively few students of color who have benefitted from affirmative action does not take history of discrimination against black students into consideration. Me chances are that if race were not a consideration, then Ms. Fisher still wouldn’t have been accepted, because her competition was against the vast majority white students not the few black and brown students Austin let in. But, the irony is, with the high number of Asian students at USC and other American campuses, white students may need the very policies they seek to dismantle.
Excellent article! Affirmative action policies need to be terminated in the workplace too!  If Abigail Fisher’s claim is true then I certainly hope she wins her case and that it sets a precedent!  If the human population was blind than there would be NO color discrimination and each individual would be chosen for right reasons!
