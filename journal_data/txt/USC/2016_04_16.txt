Amid chants from the spirit leaders and band of “Beat the Tide, they will lose,” approximately 23,000 fans gathered in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Saturday afternoon for USC’s spring football game.
“I love being here,” junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster said. “This is one of the best stadiums in the world to play in and for me to be here … it’s amazing.”
The squad split into Cardinal and White teams, but did not play a traditional game, instead participating in situational drills because of the defensive line’s continued lack of depth.
Before the game, head coach Clay Helton said he was proud of the team’s progress but acknowledged that there was work remaining.
“We’re further ahead than I thought we would be,” Helton said. “Thank God we have 29 practices left before our first game.”
Saturday’s game was the last practice of spring camp, and with it the quarterback battle raged on. Helton said he would review the game tape and, if he was satisfied and saw significant enough separation, could name a starter as early as Monday. Otherwise, the battle could last until fall camp.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold took the first snap of the day and handed the ball off to sophomore tailback Ronald Jones II, followed by a touchdown throw from redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne to Smith-Schuster.
“Coach Helton has a great dilemma having two great quarterbacks,” Browne said. “The best guy is going to play, and it’s my job to work my talent and come ready to go in the fall.”
Smith-Schuster said he would spend time taking reps with both Browne and Darnold until a starting quarterback is named.
“We don’t know who the quarterback is, so if we’re going to get better I have to learn how to adjust to both of them,” Smith-Schuster said.
During the run drills, the wealth continued to be spread as Jones, sophomore tailback Aca’Cedric Ware and senior tailback Justin Davis all saw a significant number of carries and reached the end zone on multiple occasions.
“The great thing is with the speed of our running backs, when you see [Davis] and [Jones] … they really have speed to get around the edge,” Helton said. “I thought they did a great job not only running the ball today, but I was impressed with how they caught the ball out of the backfield — there weren’t a lot of drops from them.”
The offensive unit stole the show from a short-handed defense that was even shorter by the end of the day, losing sophomore defensive tackle Noah Jefferson to a hyperextended elbow.
“We are a little bit limited defensively from a personnel standpoint,” Helton said. “We limited [the] package today.”
Near the end of the game, Helton invited the crowd to cheer as redshirt freshman long snapper Jake Olson, who is blind, entered the game. After a standing ovation, Olson snapped for two successful field goal attempts.
“To walk out in front of these fans and say, ‘I’m going to get the opportunity to snap in front of my Trojan family,’ and to hit two dead on the money, how special a kid is he?” Helton said.
However, the Alabama Crimson Tide looms in the distance for a Trojan team that has now finished their spring ball.
“These kids know how special it is to go to Dallas Cowboys stadium and play Alabama, we all know that, we look forward to the opportunity,” Helton said.

Director Jon Favreau can do no wrong. No one will ever be able to reopen the Jungle Book the way he did. 
In his new iteration of Rudyard Kipling’s 1894 story and Disney’s animated 1967 feature, Favreau melds the fanciful, tonally zealous elements of Kipling’s in with the more recognizable, comedic stylings of a Disney musical comedy. Ultimately, the film emerges with an extraordinary, plot-driven adventure movie just off enough from the 1967 one that the audience is left feeling like they’ve watched something completely new. And in a sense, we have.
Favreau’s film is visually stunning, the novelty of it rooted in its almost entirely computer-generated nature. Though the film was photo-real, all but one of the star-studded cast — which includes Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Lupita Nyong’o, Scarlett Johansson, Giancarlo Esposito and Christopher Walken — was computer generated. That is, the only living, breathing person you actually see in the film is newcomer Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli, amid this incredible backdrop of minimal live-action sets and principal computer generation. Every leaf, every pebble, every hair on Baloo’s 15-foot body, is digitally rendered.
If the effects weren’t as fantastic as they are, those in the audience wouldn’t be able to see Walken’s face and mannerisms essentially superimposed on King Louie and wouldn’t be able to see Murray’s eyes con Mowgli into helping him get some honey. They also wouldn’t be so convinced Sethi wasn’t hanging around live animals the whole time on set — in reality, Favreau commissioned puppeteers from Jim Henson’s Creature Shop to keep Sethi engaged while filming on blue screen.
Favreau’s film, from the first few notes, hits right where it has to, waxing between the reverential sentimentality of a remake and the regency of a brand new story, and, even more than it is the visuals, it’s all in the music.
The composer’s often the last one hired to a movie, with sometimes just weeks to go until the premiere, but John Debney, Academy Award-nominated and Emmy Award-winning composer, was one of director Jon Favreau’s first picks with their new go at The Jungle Book. That made all the difference. In fact, The Jungle Book is the culmination of two years of intense work and incredible love and respect for storytelling. Of all people, Debney would know it best.
“My dad worked at Disney for 40 years, so I grew up as a kid at the studio,” Debney said. “When I was a young boy … I would invariably go with my dad to the studio. We’d poke around the studio, he’d show me his office, the animators’ rooms and quite often … we’d bump into this other man — this kind of very warm, loud man…and I remember my dad would introduce him as Mr. Disney. And he would always tousle my hair.”
The warmth he experienced then is what Debney brought with him to this project, and you can tell that he’d known the original Jungle Book inside and out from the first few notes of the new film, a nod to the introduction of the original.
“My job, number one, was to come up with a whole new original score,” Debney said. “And yet we decided very early…we knew we had to give the nods that we had and give our little homages. And so, as this thing progressed and morphed, [Favreau] had the idea of ‘why don’t we use this theme here.’”
Different characters came to be represented by twists on the old themes we know and love. But when “I Wanna Be Like You” started to play, the entire theater lit up. The filmmakers definitely paid their respects subtly — they created a new theme for Mowgli, present through the entire film; a few-note motif for Shere Khan with low brass and strings (he’s always lurking). Bagheera, on the other hand, got nobility with horns and strings swelling whenever he was present. Kaa’s music and Johansson’s voice were as seductive as her story, with overblown flutes and weird atonal orchestral colors. King Louie got percussion, wooden sounds and a nice showbizz lead-in. Baloo was in Dixieland for the new iteration of “Bear Necessities.”
“[Favreau] was very specific with different instruments for different characters,” Debney said. “The French horns became the elephant sound…at the end of the movie, those French horns are just glorious, and they’re playing very high and very regal.”
Debney said he was blessed with the orchestra he got to work with.
“I was given a gift,” Debney said. “I had a 105-piece orchestra and a 70-voice choir. [They were] incredible instrumentalists — you heard some of the flute work, the ethnic flutes, the big drums and the percussion. I was given a gift. I was given the greatest gift of my career.”
And the team didn’t exclusively work with an orchestra, either. To honor not only the original film but also the world culture in it, they flew to New Orleans to get a bona fide taste of the music that had so influenced Disney.
“The original was influenced by New Orleans jazz and we really wanted to honor that,” Debney said. “[We] went down to New Orleans and recorded the real guys down there. That’s what gives it such an air of authenticity. We were very aware, [Favreau] especially, of the different changes in culture over the years.”
It’s the jungle. It’s a world sensibility. And it was just wonderful. And when asked which film score he’s most proud of, Debney cited none other than this one in collaboration with Favreau..
“This one I’m most proud of because this one was a longer process and I was on it for two years, or really 40 years, because I lived with Disney as my family and in my heart,” Debney said. “That’s why I think it means so much to me. It’s a full circle journey. My dad worked there for 44 years, that’s why it’s personal for me. That’s why I gave it my very best.”
When you inevitably go see this feat of technology, consider re-watching the 1967 one first. Pay close attention to the beginning and ending, and, in this new one, to all the take-offs and landings for each character. And stick around for the end credits — you’ll be treated to something you’ve been waiting for since the first teaser trailer.
