I was a mess in the minutes leading up to my first counseling appointment. I had used the  Engemann Student Health Center’s online portal to sign up for a 20-minute phone consultation, which was meant to “assess my needs” as a first-time client. I scoped out the area to make sure nobody was around to listen in on my conversation. My phone rang. I took a deep breath. 
It was a casual talk. I gave the counselor a brief rundown of my situation, but I didn’t give him all the details of my mental health issues. This was the first time I’d reached out to anyone independently, and I was not about to spill my life story to a stranger over the phone. He proceeded with the formal questions they ask all initial applicants — “have you experienced suicidal thoughts?” “have you ever considered harming yourself or another person?” I answered “no” in both cases. The counselor on the other line then informed me that my condition wasn’t serious enough for an immediate session in person, and that if I wanted help I could either sign up for the waitlist — of which I was unlikely to be taken off — or, because I didn’t have a car in L.A., take the bus to a counseling office off campus. Neither sounded appealing to me. 
I convinced myself I was fine. I continued my weekly routine, and, as months passed, felt increasingly discouraged from contacting Engemann again. But I always held a grudge against the place that turned me away, the place that, in my mind, shoved me backward after I took a step forward. 
I, of course, was not fine. But through it all, what has comforted me — and made me all the more angry — is that I wasn’t alone. The reality is that college students are suffering from an increasingly prevalent mental health crisis. And universities like USC aren’t doing nearly enough to address it. 
The transition into college life is a hard time for most. Moving away from home, leaving behind family, forming new social circles — the list goes on — can all be additional strains on an already rigorous academic experience. At elite colleges, high school valedictorians who have received nothing less than a 4.0 their entire lives are faced with the challenge of competing against thousands of other 4.0 valedictorians, a pool in which brilliant minds are, unfortunately, average.
While what I listed is just an iota among a laundry list of mental health concerns, it’s no surprise, then, that according to a 2013 survey by the American College Health Association, 40 percent of male and 57 percent of female college students reported feeling overwhelmingly anxious, and 27 percent of male and 33 percent of female respondents reported feeling seriously depressed. The ACHA has also indicated that suicide rates among young adults have tripled since the 1950s. 
So, at a private institution like USC — one that prides itself on the individual attention and support given to each student — why isn’t mental health at the forefront of campus policy? 
This is a question many have asked but few have answered. As a member of the Daily Trojan Editorial Board, it was a part of my job to conduct a panel interview of Undergraduate Student Government’s presidential candidates, and to endorse a ticket based on its platform points. To my pleasant surprise, both pairs identified expanding mental health services as a key objective for the new academic year. But that was about all of the details they discussed on the matter.

To be fair, attempting to fix a system that fails to recognize its brokenness is no easy task. But there are several key shortcomings that the University needs to recognize and address.
The most obvious problem is USC’s failure to provide students with individual counseling. While I will not argue with the notion that the most serious cases should receive help first, every mental health issue starts somewhere — the University cannot wait until the last moment to release a struggling student from purgatory. Among the 621 colleges that responded to a 2017 survey by the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors, 68 percent reported that their centers did not have a waitlist, and among those that did, the average wait time for a first appointment was 17.3 business days. Considering that USC recently spent $700 million on a campus expansion project, surely it has the resources to hire more counselors and decrease the size of its waitlist. 
Moreover, USC also needs to exercise a sense of transparency regarding its mental health services. If the University is able to send countless emails telling students to buy season football tickets, why can’t it also remind them of the wellness services to which they may or may not be entitled? A student struggling to come to terms with mental illness should not have to jump through additional hoops just to find the online counseling portal.
Lastly, if it must redirect students to counseling offices off campus, then USC should have the responsibility to organize transportation for those who don’t have cars on campus. After a student works up the courage to admit he or she should get help and then move forward with scheduling an appointment, it’s a slap in the face to be told the nearest center is a bus ride and a few Ubers away. 
At the very least, students can do their part by helping eliminate some of the perceived stigma surrounding mental illnesses. That means being more vocal about these issues: We may feel comfortable discussing a cold, but opening up about about struggles with anxiety is another story. It also means that we cannot romanticize or joke about mental illnesses on social media for retweets and likes. While speaking about these issues should be normalized, we also need to realize that mental illnesses are not hip or trendy. They are problems that can and should be fixed. But speaking from experience, the biggest mistake people can make is to believe mental illnesses are problems with them instead of ones happening to them.
To be clear, the primary objective of this column wasn’t to get revenge by exposing the University’s inadequacies; I truly believe USC wants the best for its student body. Rather, I started “Mindful Mondays” to incite discussions that would encourage students to be more considerate, to exercise a sense of mindfulness toward all members of the Trojan Family.
Mental health is a spectrum; we all fall on it somewhere. Everybody experiences hard times, but the heaviest burdens to bear are often the most difficult to see. It’s not always just the girl with dark circles under her eyes and scars on her wrists. Sometimes, it’s the athlete struggling to balance schoolwork with the demands of coaches and recruiters. Sometimes, it’s the 4.0 student who hits all the marks but is internally drowning in the pressures of academic perfection. And sometimes, it’s the very person writing this article. Be mindful.

Grand Central Market has been a cultural landmark for Angelenos and visitors alike since it was founded in 1917. Today, the historic space is surely a manifestation of the cultural diversity of Los Angeles with its vast array of vendors, but it is also representative of the socioeconomic inequities that exist within the city.
Shortly after its centennial in Fall 2017, Grand Central Market was acquired by Adam Daneshgar, a Beverly Hills investor and graduate of USC Price School of Public Policy’s Master of Real Estate Development Program. 
Though Daneshgar intends to refinish the infrastructure and implement a concierge in the market, among other things, his visions are centered more on preservation than reinvention. In an interview with USC News, Daneshgar said, “The market is great as it is. The essence doesn’t need to be changed. It’s raw, it’s historic — but it could use a modest enhancement while maintaining its charm and roots to its history.”
Yet, since Grand Central Market’s inception in the early 20th century, it has undoubtedly undergone dramatic changes, though perhaps unknowingly. Grocers and small eateries can still be found, but the market’s primary source of revenue and commercial income are likely the expensive juice bars and coffee shops, the trendy multicultural eateries, the urban, Instagram-worthy spots like Eggslut and McConnell’s Fine Ice Cream. 
The growing attraction to these types of vendors is likely a direct result of the changing landscape surrounding Grand Central Market. While Daneshgar predicts that the nearby Angels Landing project — which will create 500 hotel rooms, 400 apartments and 200 condos across the street from Grand Central Market — will increase tourism at the market, it will also inevitably displace populations that have resided for generations in that very part of downtown Los Angeles. These are communities that once relied on the market for their livelihood but can now no longer afford much of what Grand Central Market has to offer.
That Grand Central Market can no longer serve the populations it once did speaks to the greater issue of gentrification in the Los Angeles area. To preserve this establishment, therefore — at least in the way that it presently exists — is not only to adapt to the evolving demographics of L.A., but also to uphold a system through which poorer, native communities are expelled from their homes, left struggling to seek affordable living spaces and vendors that likely no longer exist for them.
With the recent development of USC Village, USC has similarly contributed to the gentrification of Los Angeles. 
Although USC Village is open for all individuals, it is inaccessible to many members of the neighboring community: The 25 new retailers, which include KAITLYN, Sunlife Organics and Wahlburger’s, boast services and products that are widely unaffordable, thereby elevating local costs of living to the point that once-local individuals are driven out of their homes.
However, this is not to neglect some of the University’s efforts to help the surrounding community. In fact, during the development of USC Village, the University created roughly 800 jobs for those living within a five-mile radius of campus, and USC additionally invested $20 million into creating affordable housing nearby. 
Yet, it is also necessary to recognize that these measures are temporary fixes that may be undone in time.
Moving forward, the University must begin by acknowledging its role in uprooting some of the populations around it. While it’s too late to remove USC Village and undo the gentrification that has resulted from its construction, the University can at least acknowledge what it has done — and then work to help surrounding communities, perhaps through continued donations, the establishment of affordable housing or mandated efforts to employ locals. Continued support for USC’s neighboring community is clearly needed, and it is time for the University to respond.

For Ken Breisch, the books found within libraries are just as fascinating as another defining part of many major libraries: their architecture. Breisch is an associate professor in the USC School of Architecture, and served as the Director of Graduate Programs in Heritage Conservation until 2011. His renowned work focuses on the architecture of American public libraries and museums.
Architecture professor Ken Breisch spoke at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books Sunday at a panel called “The Politics of L.A. Spaces: From Architectural Icons to Homelessness and Gentrification.” Photo from USC News.
During his time as director, the program received the California Preservation Foundation President’s Award and a Los Angeles Conservancy Preservation Award.
Breisch spoke on a panel Sunday at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books called “The Politics of L.A. Spaces: From Architectural Icons to Homelessness and Gentrification” along with R. Scott Mitchell, an assistant professor of practice at the USC School of Architecture, and Sesshu Foster, a poet and novelist. The panelists spoke on the growing problem of space in Los Angeles, and how it is contributing to gentrification and homelessness. Breisch spoke about the community-building aspect of public art spaces like libraries and museums.
The Heritage Conservation program Breisch directed was originally called “historic preservation,” but Breisch changed the name in order to better reflect the program’s intent. 
“Historic preservation tends to have the connotation that we’re just saving big houses, which is fine,” Breisch said. “But every community in L.A. — and there are many different communities — have a heritage. Often times we’re not preserving things, we’re conserving things, so that, I think, is why we changed the name.”
The program aimed to expose students to the “foundational ideas and basic skills of urban design and place-making,” according to its website.
“I had a vision for the historic preservation program that was different than preservation programs were normally seen as, and I think other programs around the country are changing, becoming much less elitist, much more democratic in a lot of ways,” Breisch said. “So I think that’s a very good thing.”
In addition to the program, Breisch has published multiple books on American architectural history, such as The Los Angeles Central Library: Building an Architectural Icon and American Libraries: 1730 to 1950.

A step into the Explore Pop-Up Gallery transports attendees into a virtual world made physical. Vibrant art pieces you might see at any museum are on display, but they’re featured in a striking way — framed as the Instagram posts that the art pieces started as.

Since Fall 2017, the students in the Disruptive Innovation course at the USC Iovine and Young Academy have been working on a year-long project to complete. With a limit of $100, each group of students pursued a hands-on business idea to address a problem persisting in the community. 
For this project, freshmen Kaitlyn Chu, Kyle Michel, Elly Berge and Jennifer Jing, who major in arts, technology and the business of innovation, created the Explore Pop-Up Gallery at Art Share L.A. The gallery, which was open this weekend, featured the work from a diverse community of Instagram artists to replicate the social media platform’s “Explore Feed” feature in person.
“[At] the Iovine and Young Academy, they really emphasize innovation and taking risks,” Chu said. “This pop-up museum for Instagram artists is something that we have never seen done before. So the Academy really gave us that push and drive to try new things and to not be afraid.” 
According to Michel, the group had several brainstorming sessions throughout the year. The problem that the students focused on addressing how to get local artists more exposure for their work. 
“The best way we thought to do that was to grasp the burgeoning industry of pop-up museums, like the Museum of Ice Cream and the Museum of Failure,” Michel said. “We wanted to merge the artist exposure and pop-up idea for our project.” 
The students selected 15 different Instagram artists who created artwork that reflected their own personal brands. Artists ranged from a 15-year-old student from the Orange County School of Arts to a creator from Venezuela.
According to Chu, the group wanted to display a variety of art media. Some of the artwork that was hung included watercolors, color pencils, oil paintings, digital work, photography and pastels. 
“What I love about this project is that you can hypothetically be given so many assignments,” Berge said. “They could have said, ‘Hypothetically, here’s $100. What are you going to do, how are you going to start your business?’ You never know if it’s actually going to work out, and you don’t get to see it happen. The most amazing part of this project was being here all weekend and seeing people actually enjoying what we worked on and it being a physical hands-on product.” 
The works of art were displayed with the Instagram app’s distinctive frame. While some were suspended in the middle of the room, the rest were hung on the walls with binder clips. 
“When we made our demo presentations, I made a physical model of the museum, which included the way we were going to hang the artwork,” Jeng said. “Initially, we didn’t think the structure of the hanging would be possible because the space of the room might not allow it. But I’m really happy with the way it turned out because the use of the binder clips makes the artwork more visually impactful and raw.”
To make the gallery more interactive, attendees were given heart stickers at the entrance, reminiscent of those that appear when users ‘like’ an Instagram post. Throughout the gallery, they pressed the stickers onto the walls next to their favorite pieces. 
According to Michel, the group hopes to continue this museum after the end of the course. They are currently looking for another space to create a second pop-up museum in Los Angeles.
“I hope our museum viewers realize that art is everywhere,” Michel said. “Art is definitely in your local area and in your community. Artists are always surrounding us and those artists that have little exposure or little followings are also able to make extremely quality pieces of art.”

Over a decade into J. Cole’s accomplished career, KOD is the closest thing to a trap album the North Carolina rapper has ever created. But despite the switch-up in sound, it’s exactly what hip-hop fans have come to expect from the MC: a purposeful, meaningful album with a message, this time criticizing the glorification of drug abuse in hip-hop. Combined with the revamped production value, it’s perhaps his most compelling album yet, already stirring the eye-opening conversation that J. Cole expressed his gratitude for on Twitter the day after its release.

Even the album’s startling cover art is out of character compared to J. Cole’s previous, low-stakes artwork, depicting himself in a twisted royalty with five hazy-eyed, intoxicated children blissfully sipping and smoking from inside the folds of his robe. It’s the same woozy, off-kilter essence that pervades the music behind J. Cole’s admonishments, putting an appropriate spin on the booming beats of the current hip-hop landscape. On “Once an Addict – Interlude,” he gives the most cutting critique of the downfalls of drug abuse, detailing his mother’s relationship with alcoholism and its effect on J. Cole’s mental state. “So ‘Ville became my escape from a feelin’ I hate/Mama cursing me out, depression’s such a villainous state,” he raps near the opening of the song, before eventually revealing that he wishes he had done more to intervene instead of distancing himself from the scene.
 On KOD,  J. Cole is doing his best to right that wrong, gripping the music world by the throat with the surprise announcement of his album and then pouring out 42 minutes of counseling from his soul. “FRIENDS” is another instance of the conscious artist speaking out against drug abuse, building to a breaking point before the chorus as he advises the listener to meditate rather than medicate. Effortlessly settling into his pocket over the ticketing drum loop, it’s an album standout because of both the sonics and the message.
 Elsewhere on “BRACKETS,” J. Cole pauses from the overarching message to talk about his frustration with the tax system in America and his lack of control over what is being done with his money. “Let me pick the things I’m funding from an app on my screen/better that than letting wack congressman I’ve never seen,” he rhymes on the second verse, decrying the uneven spread of resources while particularly pointing out deficiencies in the schools.
 When he picks up the pace on “ATM,” J. Cole impresses with a blistering delivery over an equally blistering beat, creating a song that will have lasting replay value within the trap-influenced realm of mainstream rap. His braggadocious, yet self-critiquing bars are fully engaging, taking the popular triplet flow and masterfully bending the tempo at will.

It’s hard to say that a 12-song album overstays its welcome, but KOD comes dangerously close to tipping over the critical point after “ATM,” due to its languishing pulse and heavy, dense subject matter. On its own, “Kevin’s Heart” isn’t bad, but in sequence with the rest of KOD it drags on the ears a bit due to the drop off in energy and Cole’s weary vocal delivery. In terms of lyrical content, the subsequent “BRACKETS” and “Once an Addict — Interlude” are more captivating, but the downtempo music behind it puts the responsibility on the listener to keep their focus, rather than Cole gripping them to the speakers with enthralling production. 
At the end of the tracklist, however, “1985 — Intro to ‘The Fall Off,’” does more than simply tie the album off nicely, doubling as a menacing send-off aimed at much of the younger generation seeking to follow in Cole’s successful footsteps. His dismantling lyrics come across more from the perspective of an amused uncle rather than an angered opponent, offering advice and appearing almost sympathetic to their actions. Still, even if branding the outro as an “intro” didn’t express the message clearly enough, his knowing chuckle after ending the song and album with “Just remember what I told you when your sh-t flop / In five years, you gon’ be on ‘Love & Hip Hop’” certainly does, hinting at more verbal assaults if his warning shot doesn’t receive the desired response.
There’s a dry, sneaky humor in releasing KOD on April 20, the unofficial holiday dedicated to marijuana, especially as J. Cole names weed as one of the vices in the outro to the title track “KOD.” If anything, though, it only emphasizes his purpose behind the project, making it impossible to overlook when playing the album. By crafting a more commercial-friendly sound without sacrificing what’s endeared him to scores of fans over the years, KOD has the potential to reach more ears than any previous J. Cole album, and it’s clear that the artist knows what he wants to do with the increased attention.

For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
-2 Corinthians 5:4
 For 85 years, my grandmother was one of the purest souls to walk the earth, and a blessing to everyone she encountered. While I was growing up in San Diego, flying across the country to visit her in Thomasville, N.C., was rarely more than an annual occasion, but was always a journey marked with wholesome joy and warm, welcoming energy. Even when my youthful mind didn’t want to leave the excitement of California to spend a week in a small, rural town across the country, I was unable to refrain from smiling in her presence; whether she was asking me about life at school, or stuffing my mouth with enough soul food to last me through the next year of my mother’s health-conscious cooking back home.
 I broke down in tears at the office when I heard the news of her passing last Monday, and again in the bathroom as I tried to escape detection, and again after work while watching the sunset over the Santa Monica Pier. Over the past several years, she had suffered a great deal as her body and eventually her mind began to fail her, but I was still unprepared to accept that such a constant beacon of light in my life was no more. Very much the matriarch of the Stukes household, losing her created an irreplaceable void, even though her presence could still be felt throughout her home while the family gathered for the funeral.
 My grandmother’s life mattered tremendously to those in Thomasville, many of whom packed the pews at Friendship Baptist Church for her homegoing celebration. A devout, God-fearing woman until the end, not even the loss of her leg had stopped her from serving in the church; she faithfully showed up in her wheelchair every Sunday to praise the Lord to the best of her ability. To other church members as well as the pastors, she was an inspiration, lending her voice to the choir and doing all that she could to support it.

Especially in times of hardship I tend to detach myself between my headphones, but during Saturday’s service I was reminded instead of the importance of community in such moments. Following the committal ceremony at the nearby burial grounds, I found encouragement toward the end of the family repass while listening to one of my mother’s high school friends comfort her during her sorrows. Several years ago, this woman had simultaneously lost her mother and sister in a car accident, with the 20th anniversary of the tragedy coming up days after my grandmother’s funeral. Although she made no effort to hide the fact that she was still grieving their deaths, she greeted us with a smile on her face and fond words of encouragement, reminding us to come to terms with the loss in our own ways and at our own pace. Even more so than the soothing music I had been playing on repeat the entire week, her resilience and compassion did much to uplift me, changing the course of the day and reminding me to focus on the blessings my grandmother had given me over the years.
 So instead of focusing on my final memory of my grandmother laid up in the nursing home, struggling to recognize and connect with the faces of the loved ones hovering around her, I’ll think of her during the good times, with a song on her lips and a smile on her face. 
I’ll remember sleeping in the closet-sized bedroom packed to the brim with stuffed animals and pillows, and waking up to the smell of good food burning on the stove just across the living room. I’ll remember the endless amounts of love and affection she showed me while she was still here; not only because it makes the pill of her loss easier to swallow, but also because it encourages me to follow in her footsteps and leave the same positive impact that she had on all who were fortunate enough to call her a sister, a parent or a grandmother.

The USC women’s water polo team enjoyed its Senior Night festivities with a dominant 11-5 win over the UCLA Bruins. The mood at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Saturday night was bittersweet as the parade of departing senior standouts displayed just the kind of talent that the squad would soon be missing in the coming weeks. This sentiment, however, was cut short as the Women of Troy got off to a hot start over the Bruins.
Prior to this weekend’s rivalry game, the Trojans and Bruins had faced off once before this season. In the mid-February championship match of the Triton Invitational in San Diego, USC managed to outlast UCLA by a final margin of 6-4. The Trojans didn’t think that victory had truly been secured until the final whistle blew, despite strong performances by junior goaltender Amanda Longan and senior driver Brianna Daboub.
“It comes down to energy,” senior utility Hayley McKelvey of the team’s mentality heading into the crosstown rematch. “Our girls have been really good about focusing on the positives and letting that influence the rest of our game.”
Saturday night was a much different matchup. Playing in front of an incredibly rowdy home crowd and with the Trojan Marching Band out in full force, it was clear that the team was feeding off of the energy from the stands. The team was already in peak performance with its 10-game winning streak over the likes of Stanford and Cal indicating its prowess. However, USC truly came to life in the regular season finale.
“It was about focusing on the next play … what our offense would do the next possession not what [else] was going on,” McKelvey said.
From the opening whistle, the Women of Troy came out active and firing on the offensive side against the Bruins. It took the squad under four minutes to draw first blood as a fast break from junior driver Courtney Fahey set up sophomore utility Maud Megens for an easy finish on net.
This standard of play was replicated throughout most of the first half as the Trojans continued to press UCLA’s zone and maintain the aggressive offensive push. Megens would pick up her second score of the night after Daboub drew a penalty shot while McKelvey notched a first-half hat trick, giving USC a solid 5-1 lead at the break.
McKelvey would finish the game with an impressive 5 scores, granting her 100 total goals in her USC career. But what is more impressive were the various ways in which she was able to find the back of the net. From power plays and quick passes to unbelievable shots that were lofted high over the UCLA keeper’s head or ricocheted in hard off the crossbar, McKelvey continued to raise the bar for each goal she scored on the night.
In the third quarter, the Trojans sustained their only real adversity of the night when UCLA picked up back-to-back scores within a span of under 30 seconds to cut the 4-goal halftime lead down to just 2 scores. Clearly, USC felt and responded well to the pressure by scoring 4 unanswered goals before the third period ended, leaving an insurmountable 9-3 scoreline on the board.
In the fourth, USC would again be efficient in their domination of the Bruins and finish off the night with an impressive 11-5 victory. While Longan stood tall in net, with a magnificent five-save performance, head coach Jovan Vavic decided to rotate through the goaltender depth. To start the fourth quarter, senior Victória Chamorro was put in net where she stopped two of three Bruin chances. As time ran down, however, Chamorro was pulled in favor of senior netminder Nicola Gonzales. Finishing off the rivalry win put a great ending on what has proven to be a rather magical season for the Women of Troy.
This victory, as well as the 10 consecutive wins that preceded it, will surely propel the team forward as it prepares for the MPSF Tournament this weekend. With USC having guaranteed a bye in the first round, it will be a waiting game to see what team the Trojans will play in their first match.
“We just want to keep our momentum going,” freshman driver Paige Hauschild said. “The regular season went better than we could’ve expected … ultimately [the focus is] to win the national championship.”

The Trojans return to Los Angeles after dominating the Arizona State Sun Devils in a 19-2 victory on Saturday. The victory continues a streak of dominance that includes a 17-7 win last week against San Diego State and concludes the regular season for the Women of Troy. The Trojans are set to rematch ASU on Thursday in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament.

The win improved USC’s record to 2-0 against Arizona State and marked the team’s first-ever game played in Arizona. The Women of Troy were an unstoppable force on the field, entering the Pac-12 Tournament as the third seed. 
The Women of Troy dominated ASU throughout the game. The Trojans started off strong against the Sun Devils, scoring 3 goals unanswered before Arizona State’s junior attacker Kerri Clayton could score to bring the score to 3-1.
The first half ended heavily in favor of USC, with a score of 12-1. In fact, in the 35 minutes following Arizona State’s first score, the Trojans put 15 points on the board while the Sun Devils were held scoreless through most of the second half. By the time Clayton scored her second goal of the day, the 18-2 deficit was too much for the Sun Devils to overcome. The Trojans added one more score as the second half wound down to make the final score 19-2 in favor of USC. 
As a whole, the Trojans collected a season-high 18 draw controls led by junior defender Jackie Gilbert, who set a single-game season high with 12 draw wins.  Gilbert’s performance on Saturday set a new career-high for her, as she moves into third in USC history with 87 draw controls. Gilbert also scored her first goal since scoring 2 in one game during her freshman season. 
Sophomore midfielder Kerrigan Miller continued to be a strong asset for the Trojans by posting her fifth hat trick of the season and the 11th of her career. Miller finished with 3 goals, two assists, three ground balls and two caused turnovers against the Sun Devils. She is currently tied with Gabby McMahon (2014-2017) for sixth place in career points accounted for as a Trojan with 97.    
Freshman midfielder Kelsey Huff continued a promising career as a Trojan by scoring 3 goals for her fifth career hat trick and adding two assists. Huff’s stellar performance was imperative to the Trojans’ success over the weekend and she will be a valuable member of the team entering the Pac-12 Tournament. 
In her last regular season game as a Trojan, senior defender Lydia Sutton led all players with five ground balls to go along with one caused turnover. The All-American defender has been a valuable part of the team’s success all season and Saturday’s win over Arizona State was no different. 
Sophomore midfielder Kaeli Huff was also able to contribute 2 goals to Saturday’s total. With those goals, Huff moved into ninth on the all-time career points scored list.
Sophomore attacker Izzy McMahon, who ranks third on the team in points scored, continued a stellar season with 2 goals scored against the Sun Devils on Saturday. Sophomore attacker Hope Anhut closed out her first season as a Trojan with 2 goals against the Sun Devils. Graduate attacker Maeve McMahon played well in her last regular season game as a Trojan adding a goal against Arizona State to her statline to go along with a stellar season where she led the team in assists.
Coming off of a two-game winning streak where the Trojans have won by a combined 36-9, the Women of Troy are entering the Pac-12 Tournament the third-ranked team in the conference. The Trojans, who are 2-0 all-time against Arizona State, will be traveling to Boulder, Colo. this Thursday to play the Sun Devils  again, this time at a neutral site.

Losing sucks. And absolutely no one likes being blown out. The USC baseball team knows this all too well.
This past weekend was exceptionally rough for the Trojans as they dropped three games by a margin of 6-42 to the No. 15 UCLA Bruins. Yes, UCLA is a great baseball team and USC is a young team that is still trying to recover from an abysmal 2017 season, but two blow out losses of this magnitude are unacceptable. Earlier this season, the rivals met at Dodger Stadium and the Trojans stole a victory with a 3-2 scoreline. This game gave me a lot of hope for USC baseball coming into this past weekend.
The team has had an interesting season so far. It has been almost impossible to predict the outcome of any of their matchups. One day they are playing a tight nine innings with No. 5 Arkansas, only to be bested a couple weeks later by UC Santa Barbara. Baseball is a variable game, and a no-name team can upset the No. 1 seed on any given day. I wrote a column praising the unpredictability of baseball, but this is not the case for USC’s team. When they win, they overcome adversity to grind out tough games, but when they lose, the games are too often blowouts.
Consistency is a difficult thing for a team to achieve in any sport — especially baseball. USC has yet to sweep a Pac-12 series and has won only two of six series. When the Trojans lose, it most often comes as a result of an early lead from their opposition. That lead then snowballs in to a bigger and bigger lead. Moreover, the Men of Troy have not won a single Pac-12 matchup in which they have trailed to start the game. Head coach Dan Hubbs and co. need to find a way to limit big innings because when the Trojans get down by a decent margin early, they are out.

The Trojans are a young team and there will naturally be some growing pains. Despite the large amount of rookies and second-years, a lot of young players have stepped up to the plate (no pun intended). Freshman pitcher Kyle Hurt has had a solid inaugural season. His 5.14 ERA isn’t particularly great, but eliminating his last two starts — which were blowouts — quickly drops his ERA to 2.81. He needs to work on limiting the amount of batters he grants base on balls as he has walked 36 batters in 49 innings pitched. As a freshman, he has a lot of time to develop and could become a lethal weapon for the Trojans in the future.
The duo of catchers, sophomore Blake Sabol and redshirt sophomore Kaleb Murphy, have demonstrated their ability to come in clutch. Sabol had a great season in 2017 and has continued his success this season. Murphy, on the other hand, was a stranger to the field in 2017 but has contributed greatly in his first season as a starter, recording the third best batting average on the team with .294. The pair split time behind the plate; when Murphy is catching, Sabol has been taking reps in left field. Sabol’s versatility and five-tool playstyle make him a significant asset to the team.
One of the things the Trojans are missing this year is the lack of bat presence from the veterans on the team. Junior outfielder Lars Nootbaar was a heavily influential bat in the 2017 season, recording a .313 average and .419 on base percentage. With a .225 batting average and .350  OBP in 2018, Nootbaar has yet to reach the level of production he exhibited last season. His talent is there and we have seen glimpses of his strong hitting capability, but much like the team as a whole, the consistency just isn’t there.
When the Trojans win, they appear to be a solid team. The key is for USC to get on their opponents early and limit big innings. Walking batters leads to putting runners in scoring position, which ultimately leads to runs. By no means are these tasks easy to accomplish, but they will help make significant strides toward finding consistent play.
