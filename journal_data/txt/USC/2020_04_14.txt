Sunday’s fourth season premiere of “Insecure” opened on a high note. After waiting more than a year to witness Issa (Issa Rae) and her funny, drama-ridden friend group, of course, the expected opening shots of Los Angeles were a delight. Yet, even better than the series’ return was the music used in the premiere. 
Opening with Tyler, the Creator’s “A BOY IS A GUN” is a unique yet fitting choice. Though I haven’t quite deciphered the eerie opening sequence with the less-popular “IGOR” track in the background, it works. Passing Randy’s Donuts, a neon “good vibes only” sign, vendor booths and the main stage of what seems to be Issa’s block party, the hook, “You so motherfuckin’ dangerous” with “No, don’t shoot me down,” humming beneath, seems to foreshadow the demise of Issa and Molly’s friendship. Yet, the placement could solely be a sonic choice — more so reflecting Issa’s quirky-Black personality. She’s no Odd Future member but the protagonist of HBO’s comedy series is arguably as odd as Tyler, the Creator himself.
Anytime I hear “We were low, we were high, Jekyll, Hyde / I’ll still stay by your side,” an instant smile graces my face. If there weren’t a Mereba track in this season, I’d honestly be shocked. “Sandstorm,” the single from her 2019 album “The Jungle Is The Only Way Out,” is set to more fly-over shots of Los Angeles, as well as Molly and Issa’s self-care Sunday. 
“This week, we have a guided yoga session set to the Mereba album, along with some herbal enhancements pre-rolled to perfection,” Issa said, with the song playing in the background elevating the show’s storytelling. Erykah Badu’s “Green Eyes,” Goapele’s “Closer” or Amel Larrieux’s “For Real” could have served as the soundtrack to the duo’s smoke-and-yoga session, but they would’ve missed the mark as stereotypical choices for Black women who do yoga and smoke weed. The lesser-known “Sandstorm” is a more subtle choice that resonates with a contemporary audience. 
Khia’s “My Neck, My Back” was the most annoying placement in the episode. I’d hate to use the word ratchet, but it best defines Issa’s tenant who requests the club anthem during Issa’s fundraiser. Hearing the track was initially funny as Issa’s brother-turned-DJ danced behind a makeshift booth. It also added to the trainwreck that her fundraiser was becoming. 
To the scene’s downfall, “All you ladies pop your pussy like this / Shake your body, don’t stop, don’t miss,” exemplifies the elements of the series that seem almost cherry-picked from Black Twitter. The selection, paired with the character who embodies it, is stereotypical and too on-the-nose. It’s an eye-roll among the other nine songs featured in the premiere, but I’m not surprised. I’m not sure if “Insecure” could survive without its caricatures. 
Unpacking every song played during the “Lowkey Feelin’ Myself” episode would be nonsensical. Anyone who’s seen the previous seasons is aware of how “Insecure” consistently delivers on the music front. More importantly is how the show’s music choices are effective in complementing an aesthetic crafted over the past few seasons. Featured are unsung heroes, such as Jazmine Sullivan’s work on the title track “Insecure” or popular newcomers like SZA’s “Supermodel” ending season two’s “Hella Questions.” Never does the show feel like a drawn-out music video, à la Hype Williams’ “Belly.” Better yet, the show’s soundtrack is reflective of a new-age of Black television, highlighting familiar settings in a new way — as FX’s “Atlanta” does — while showcasing new talent and fresh ideas. 
In a 2018 interview with Billboard, music supervisor Kier Lehman described the show’s musical tone: “The style of music they use feels very West Coast, like L.A. — very modern, not a throwback or a stereotype.” I couldn’t agree more, although “My Neck, My Back” is a glaring cliché. It’s representative of a new-age L.A. — it’s music I, as a 21-year-old, would listen to on a trip to Simply Wholesome or with friends at a strip of the beach in between Santa Monica and Malibu. 
For a while, I longed for television to return to the tradition of celebrity musical appearances which populated ’90s sitcoms: think of Boyz II Men on “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.” Yet when imagining a possible Megan Thee Stallion or Lucky Daye cameo, I can’t place it perfectly. It would come off as basic and another way to force celebrity culture down our throats. In lieu of this, “Insecure” gives us a selection of songs that ease us into Issa’s world and heighten moments such as her clique’s appearance at the Kiss ‘n’ Grind party. Taste is rare, especially when it comes to music. Better yet, taste is subjective. Kudos to Rae and Lehman for having it.

The coronavirus has turned the world upside down. In some way or another, it has touched every part of society, and at least for now, normal life is a thing of the past. Job and internship opportunities this summer have and will continue to be affected, and many will likely be canceled due to enforced social distancing and travel restrictions. All the hours in the fall spent researching internships, polishing up resumes and filling out applications may seem like they were for nothing.
Many undergraduate students feel pressured to find the perfect summer position that will not only look good, but will be a valuable learning experience and reference as they begin to search for full-time positions. Regardless of whether a student secured a prestigious summer gig and whether or not it is happening as planned, students should feel proud of what they’ve achieved and know that their work has not gone to waste. 
It’s undoubtedly frustrating to have worked all year to have an exciting opportunity lined up for the summer and then have it fall through at the last minute. It’s just as infuriating to scramble to apply for last-minute positions because employers aren’t sure what the state of the world will be like come summer. Even though it’s still at least a month away, all of USC’s abroad summer programs are canceled, most on-campus offerings have moved online and many students will now be interning for companies remotely. 
While many summer plans may not come to full fruition, students have still gained valuable experience through the internship and job process. Consciously or not, students were able to improve their resume-writing skills, practice crafting professional emails, become pros at filling out applications, improve organizational habits and get more comfortable in an interview setting — all of which are valuable tools for life. 
Many companies have had to make tough decisions about the summer and whether students will really be gaining insight by working remotely. If an internship has been moved online, it’s obviously less than ideal. Students will miss out on the immersive experience of the work environment, such as making friends with other interns and becoming a part of the daily flow of the workplace. 
However, there are still many valuable takeaways from any type of work experience, and companies that have decided to go digital have been proactive about ways to keep student interns engaged and learning. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise plans to send interns equipment so that they can connect virtually. Other companies are changing requirements and developing more conducive online learning formats, and there are many services that will connect motivated students with entirely virtual work opportunities. 
If an internship has been canceled, students should take that go-getter attitude they demonstrated during their internship interviews, and apply it to summer. While spending free time lounging at the beach might not happen in 2020, managing time is entirely up to the individual. Students should take a well-deserved break from their hectic school schedule (let’s face it, even though classes have been moved to Zoom, most end-of-the-semester assignments have remained). 
With no school or job to provide structure, students can and should still aim for some level of productivity. With the right attitude, they can access their creativity and spend time reflecting, thinking and inventing. One productive use of your time could be to build up useful skills for next internship season — learn a basic type of code, take an Adobe course, practice writing skills and if all else fails, the Duolingo owl is always waiting for you. 
Unfortunately, students have no control over plans that were canceled or changed. While there are many benefits to having an internship, and it’s likely that most employers in the future won’t blame anyone for their lack thereof during the summer of 2020. No one knows what the world will be like even two weeks from now, so summer feels like an indefinite, timeless, unpredictable void. 
Having or not having an internship does not define the worth of a student, especially during these uncertain times. Whether or not an internship has been affected, canceled, is going on as planned or didn’t exist to begin with, students should not forget to be proud of themselves for all the work they’ve put in.

Where goes the Overton window?
Also called the window of discourse, the term refers to a range of policies featured in the political mainstream. “Medicare for All” and the building of a border wall recently made their way into widely held discussions, and thus, both policies are now within the window’s frame. 
All Americans share one collective window which defines what is politically acceptable. The window reflects our culture, and it moves wherever the mainstream conversation is going.  
The presumptive nomination of Democratic candidate Joe Biden has sparked claims that the conversation is being tugged to the right: An op-ed from The New York Times even called this out in July, naming the former vice president a “Closet Republican” and attributing much of his success to his appeal to Republican voters. 
The self-described democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders represented a proportionate response to President Donald Trump –– a hard swing left to counter Trump’s swing to the far-right. In comparison, Biden seems to represent a concession to the conservative agenda: A signal that the window has moved to the right. 
This view is consistent with the parties’ positions relative to the Western “center” of politics. If we place every political party on a scale from liberal to conservative, Democrats are far closer to the median line than Republicans, who rank near the overtly xenophobic Alternative for Germany party. In other words, the United States’ political center is skewed to the right. 
But when we look at the overall trend, a different picture appears. For decades now, the United States has been becoming more liberal. Credit this to a waning white-majority, a secularizing public or rising levels of affluence, but conservatism has been losing its cultural dominance with each passing year. 
Consider the major cultural shifts of the past two decades: How many of them were conservative victories? From gay marriage to abortion, even the expanding welfare state –– liberalism is slowly winning out. 
This is not to say that the conservative party is powerless. The United States still remains a center-right nation, but its culture is shifting in the other direction. This explains a Republican stratagem that quite explicitly includes problematic practices like voter suppression. 
In response to proposals that would make it easier to vote, Trump was quoted saying, “They had … levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.” The winds are shifting course: The more people vote, the fewer Republicans win. 
However, because of the Republican party’s political maneuvering and a significant conservative base, it still wields substantial power. Vox co-founder Ezra Klein explained the dynamic well in his book, “Why We’re Polarized.” 
“The Left feels a cultural and demographic power that it can occasionally translate into political power, and the Right wields political power but feels increasingly dismissed and offended culturally,” Klein wrote. 
This explanation illuminates several aspects of the current moment in our culture. The conservative backlash against “politically correct culture” may seem like an overreaction, but it can be better understood as the fear of one’s worldview being edged out of the window of acceptable discourse. 
Furthermore, the growing notion that white Americans are oppressed –– though ripe for ridicule –– reflects a real transition. The population of the United States has been diversifying for decades, and white conservatism is settling in for a ride in the back seat. 
This all may seem counter-intuitive; when we watch the news and see crowds chanting “build that wall,” it seems that the United States is more conservative and anti-immigration than ever. But consider former President Bill Clinton’s 1996 Democratic platform, which included the same argument that Trump ran on: “We cannot tolerate illegal immigration and we must stop it.” Today, anti-immigration policies belong on the far-right of the political spectrum because the window has moved. 
Our culture is shifting left and bringing the window of discourse with it, but that doesn’t signal the death of conservatism in the United States. At most, we may see an eventual restructuring of the Republican party to reflect a liberalizing nation. But the culture war will never be won or lost, so long as Americans tend to disagree.
