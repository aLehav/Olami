With bright fabrics, glittery makeup and whimsical patterns, every Hollywood red carpet was put to shame by attendees of Remi Wolf’s concert at the Shrine Saturday. 
An icon of unapologetic authenticity and optimism in the face of obstacles, Wolf continually demonstrates how empowering it is to celebrate full creative freedom in both art and everyday life. It’s no surprise that the crowd was as stylish and colorful as the queen of fun herself. 
Saturday’s show was as vibrant as the 101 others that came before it… this year alone! The Shrine marked the latest stop in her Gwingle Gwongle Tour. Her enthralling stage presence, gorgeous background visuals and stage decor, which consists of her signature giant flower lights and a wacky couch, were all still present. 
Wolf left no part of the stage unexplored during her performance: skipping, doing cartwheels, popping bubbles, chasing her bassist around the couch and, most notably, pulling off a playful exchange between her vocals and the guitar riffs, showcasing her incredible vocal range.
While Remi Wolf is well-known for her energetic personality and danceable, upbeat songs—such as the hit single “Photo ID” that catapulted her to worldwide fame—her discography is far from unvaried. 
Wolf resonates with so many because her music and performances allow for catharsis. She is not afraid to disclose her deepest insecurities and worst life experiences with her lyrics. During transitions between songs, she narrated personal anecdotes and the stories behind the lyrics, some of which were tales of heartbreak—something she has never been scared to share with her audience. 
On the anniversary of the release of “Liquor Store,” the opening track of her debut album, “Juno,” Wolf posted the story of its conception on her Instagram. 
“The day I wrote ‘Liquor Store’ were some of the worst but most necessary hours I’ve pretty much ever lived through.. I called [my producer], hysterical, and told him I wanted to record… in a matter of four hours, we pretty much had finished… I still have never been so proud of a song. It was so real, overflowing with energy and feeling,” she wrote. Wolf’s live performance achieves exactly that.
She continued, “I’m happy that I am open and willing enough to share some of my struggles in my songs and in writing. Not only because someone out there may be able to relate and feel a bit more understood, but the opportunity it gives me to understand myself better.” 
Wolf’s music creates a special connection between artist and listener, which might explain why Wolf had no choice but to share the mike with the crowd in her latest concert. The audience deafeningly sang every word and chanted her name numerous times but were sure to respectfully quiet down when she spoke between songs.
The whole experience was both individually and collectively enjoyed. At one point Wolf encouraged the crowd to talk to their neighbor and also asked how many were studying at her alma mater, USC. She switched places with her drummer for what they now call the “ritual of affirmations,” a tradition in which Wolf plays drums while Conor Malloy encourages everyone to repeat after him. The affirmations ranged from “my friends and family don’t secretly hate me” to “I know how to do my taxes” to “I am Dua Lipa.” The audience gleefully played along, laughing, hugging their friends and yelling each response from the top of their lungs.
Although she was suffering from bronchitis in this performance, her singing was impeccable as ever. After salvaging a silent high note with creative improvisation, she denounced it by yelling “bronchitis, my ass!” 
Notably, she rewarded longtime fans with a song from her EP “I’m Allergic to Dogs,” “Down the Line,” performing the fan-favorite for the first time in over three years. Between headbanging, jumps, grunts and shouts, she delivered an ardent performance of “Michael,” a song that came out earlier this year on the deluxe version of “Juno.” While the studio versions of her songs are amazing in their own right, so are her live performances, each adding fresh new layers and variations to her art. This freedom is key to Wolf, as it allows for experimentation and artistic growth, but most of all, an incomparable fun time for both her and her fans.
By the end of the night, and on the brink of tears, Wolf emotionally announced this was the biggest show of her life. As she thanked the crowd, she created an intimate moment in the Shrine between herself and the fans. 
“I wouldn’t be coming out here without your support,” she said. “This world is so goddamn heinous, and I’m just happy that I’m with you all in this room together, to make this memory together, in this space of positivity, and expression, and art, thank you for being here tonight, from the bottom of my heart. I love you all so much.” It’s moments like these, balanced by Remi’s commanding stage presence, that make her concerts an unforgettable experience.

Subjectively speaking, Japanese anime is great. I love Japanese anime. Since I was young, I loved going to the manga sections of the local library to read the latest editions of manga and watch their associated anime, like “Maid Sama!” I was absolutely fascinated by this visual way of storytelling, especially since there was also a cultural specificity around many of the characters and plots.
I appreciated seeing East Asian classrooms represented in anime, as it reminded me of my own educational exchange program experience in Taiwan. Whenever I saw these animated depictions of Japanese food, I felt like I was back in my predominantly Asian American community in the Bay Area, where Asian restaurants aren’t a rarity, but a prominent presence in my neighborhood. Seeing Japanese food reminded me of Taiwan as a whole, where the majority of my extended family lives.
Having been under Japanese colonization, Taiwan has been influenced fundamentally by this period of the island’s history. It was common for me on my summer trips to see a plethora of Japanese food with Taiwanese twists. My grandfather can speak some Japanese. Although I could talk about the complex legacies of colonization between Taiwan and Japan, the point of me bringing this up is that visiting Taiwan helped shape my relationship with anime, which has established itself as a dominant cultural force in Taiwan. 
It was because of that global perspective that watching anime in the United States reminded me of being in Taiwan. Yet, even as my Asian American peers and I appreciated anime for its positive cultural connotations for identity, it was also difficult not to notice the way anime was appropriated.
People often conflated a love of anime with a desire to appropriate Japanese identity. Even though I loved anime, I don’t think there was ever a time when I would claim that I wasn’t Chinese or lie about my ethnicity. Nevertheless, it was common to be called the “weeaboo” label, albeit in a joking manner.
According to Dictionary.com, a “weeaboo” is defined as “a Western person who is obsessed with Japanese culture, often regarding it as superior to all other cultures.” However, Computer Hope takes a broader approach to the term’s definition, applying it to “fans of Japanese anime cartoons or manga comics.” This definition is implied to include all non-Japanese people who are invested in Japanese anime and manga.
With anime having immense cultural weight in the world — according to Solomon Pace-McCarrick at E-International Relations — anime has expanded awareness of Japan and Japanese culture. I don’t think that’s a bad thing, nor should anime lovers be immediately labeled in a derogatory manner. 
In fact, if anime is a means of both artistic and cultural expression, then this form of entertainment is able to grow an understanding of Japanese culture. Having become increasingly multicultural, as noted by Pace-McCarrick, anime is also able to cultivate empathy through storytelling. 
Despite this, a love of anime has, for lack of a better and less cringey descriptor, a dark side. Just look at Ella and Johnny on the reality TV dating show “90 Day Fiancé.” A YouTube video focuses on this exact relationship — created by “thots n prayers,” the compilation of moments from the show is titled “asian obsession on crackkk (90 day fiance: ella & johnny).” 
This video, although edited for comedic effect, features multiple real moments of the series when Ella, a 29-year-old white woman, openly describes her love of all Asian things and Asian people stemming from her love of anime. Her proclaimed love of Asian people leads her to conflate Johnny, a Chinese man, with her specific love of Japanese culture, and begin a relationship with him.
Throughout the video, Ella seems grossly unaware that her appreciation for Japanese culture is instead an infatuation that has contributed to racial objectification. She calls Johnny her “Asian prince” and that her “obsession with Asian culture” is “much more than just cosplay” because she also loves Japanese anime. It’s almost laughable how earnest Ella is — and how ignorant. 
It’s important to emphasize that the problem doesn’t lie with anime. It lies with those who consume it. As with all things, there’s a balance between loving something and fetishizing it. It’s possible to be a fan of Japanese anime without projecting it onto Asians. Still, it’s dangerous when some of the tropes present in anime, such as hypersexualization of girls, become a vehicle for stereotypes about Asian women as submissive and voiceless.
For me, it’s been a tool for understanding Taiwan’s political history and the impact of that history on my Asian American identity. For others, it’s become a means of fetishizing Asian culture and objectifying Asians. What that shows is that if anything, anime is just as complex as any other cultural medium in the world — and we need to appreciate it, not appropriate it.

Rina Sawayama has always been flashy. Her sophomore album, “Hold The Girl” — released Sept. 16 — demonstrates a step back from the extravagant motifs of power, aesthetics and luxury on her first studio album, “SAWAYAMA.” Instead, Sawayama attempts to reflect and reconcile with her younger self, while still retaining the fun and intense atmosphere of her debut album.
With “Hold The Girl,” Sawayama makes a grand effort to balance the introspective and glamorous aspects of the album, but it unfortunately falls short. While the tracks about partying and saying “F*** off” to the haters are great, the slower, softer, more reflective tracks rely on cliches to seem relatable. 
“Hold The Girl”’s opening track, “Minor Feelings” sets up the hellish atmosphere of the album. From the eye-catching tagline, “Rina is going to hell,” to the red background of the album art to the song itself,  the entire album is shrouded in an air of doom and intensity. “Minor Feelings” ends on the sound of rain and church bells, repeated throughout multiple tracks on the album, signaling that this is going to be a different type of Rina Sawayama album. 
The titular track, “Hold The Girl,” continues in this new direction, as she sings, “Sometimes I get down with guilt / For the promises I’ve broken to my younger self.” The song has more of a dance sound than the opening track, and once again, Sawayama demonstrates her musical prowess as she mixes dance with orchestral support. Sawayama is big on reflection in this album, as she struggles to reconcile the reality of her present self with the hopes and dreams of her younger self. 
However, as seen on tracks further on in the album, Sawayama’s reflection ends up repetitive and derivative. The beauty of her debut album  came from her unflinching criticism of and playfulness with ideas of wealth, beauty and societal expectations.
On “Hold The Girl”, the unfortunate three-track run of “Hurricanes,” “Send My Love To John” and “Phantom” leave a lot to be desired, relying on cliches and running the concept of past self versus present self into the ground. On “Hurricanes,” Sawayama sings, “Until I find your door, until the wind blows north / I’m running, I’m running, running into hurricanes.” 
This tired imagery of storms feels unimaginative, especially when you consider that Sawayama’s ability to push the boundaries of music is what allowed her to carve out a unique niche in the industry. 
Moreover, her insistence on focusing on the domestic and personal leads tracks like “Phantom” and “Catch Me In The Air” to feel out of place on an album that’s almost half intense dance tracks. There’s simply no way to compare the mellow and sweet sound of “Catch Me In The Air” to the intense, punishing bass line of “Frankenstein.” 
On the former, she contemplates her relationship with her single mother by singing, “So catch me in the air, the air, the air, the air, the air, the air / (Mama, look at me now,)” creating a nice domestic scene in the mind of the listener. 
But on the latter, the classic Sawayama sound comes out to create one of the strongest tracks on the album as she confronts beauty expectations, wishing she could push off the responsibility to someone else: “Oh, my God, this is so unbearable / Make it stop, this is more than medical / All I want is to feel beautiful inside and out / You’re the one who can save me from myself.” 
Similarly, take the first single released off “Hold The Girl,” “This Hell”. It feels like a proper Rina Sawayama track, full of biting witticisms and name drops of famous women scorned. She sings, “Saw a poster on the corner opposite the motel / Turns out I’m going to Hell if I keep on being myself.” 
Sawayama’s identity as a pansexual woman influences so much of her music, and it is obvious on “This Hell” as she celebrates the happiness that comes with being her authentic self. It’s fun, danceable and mixes glam-rock guitar riffs with a country twang and her pop focus. 
She tells us, “Fuck what they did to Britney, to Lady Di and Whitney / Don’t know why we’re here, but might as well get down and dirty,” and repeats the clever and tongue-in-cheek bridge of “Got my invitation to eternal damnation / Get in line, pass the wine, bitch / We’re going straight to Hell.” “This Hell” personifies everything great about the album — intense atmosphere, upbeat sound and feels like it would go really hard on Dance Dance Revolution.
Overall, “Hold The Girl” does everything half-right. The tracks that are more dance-focused feel better produced and more well-written, while her attempts at relatability and introspection rely on cliches to create an emotional impact that falls short. It lacks the “in your face” punch of her first album, and she beats the few themes of the album into the ground over the course of the 13 tracks. 
It will be interesting to see how her sound develops in the future as she deviates from the expected Rina Sawayama sound — it didn’t work out on this album, but there’s always the next.

Katy Felkner, a third-year Ph.D. student at USC’s Information Sciences Institute, began her undergraduate education as a physics major. Realizing her true passion was in technology, she switched to study computer science. Today, Felkner is developing a translation system geared toward Indigenous languages that have few native speakers in the United States. 
“In undergrad, my other major was working for a project called the Digital Baton Library, and that’s the first time I really got exposed to language technologies,” Felkner said. “That was more in the digital humanities realm, but I was always more interested in the computational and more technical aspects.”
Felkner is researching ways to simplify language barriers by developing language processing technology for Indigenous speakers. She uses low-resource neural machine translation in order to program a system capable of learning languages that are spoken mainly by Indigenous peoples seeking asylum, much like a human would use their own knowledge to translate from one language to another.
Felkner’s research, which she does alongside mentor Jonathan May, a research associate professor at the Viterbi School of Engineering, focuses on the K’iche’ language, a Guatemalan language spoken by approximately one million native individuals. Felkner estimates that there are hundreds of monolingual K’iche’ speakers seeking asylum in the United States each year.
“Currently, we’re still working on developing a decent system for K’iche’,” Felkner said. “But we’re developing methods that can be used to extend the same technology to other languages that have similar levels of resources available and have similar histories.”
There is a shortage of translators for asylum seekers who speak Indigenous languages, Felkner said, which often prevents these individuals from efficiently applying for asylum as they’re unable to communicate or access understandable resources. Felkner’s work could simplify the process by easing the burden of translation between organizations and asylum seekers.
“Some of the people who are treated the least well are people who are seeking asylum in the United States … The people who have even less ability to get a fair share are the people who cannot communicate at all within the system,” May said. “It’s really vitally important to be able to have a fair stake at your day in court, to be able to communicate effectively that you are in grave danger.”
Kristen Zaleski, psychotherapist and founding director of the Human Rights Clinic at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, said she believes the type of innovative technology Felkner is working on is groundbreaking for multiple reasons. Access to electronic records of immigration trends progresses advocacy efforts for human rights and social justice, she said. It also has the potential to familiarize immigrants with technology previously unfamiliar to them.
“We provide evidence to immigration court of trauma, and there have been cases where indigenous communities’ clients have been unable to communicate with us because we can’t find a translator that speaks their language,” Zaleski said. “Having an ability to understand someone’s native language and tell their story, in their own words, is so crucial.”
Felkner said the desire to do good for those who recieve little help otherwise drives her.  
“It’s fulfilling to know that I’m really doing something that not a lot of people are doing, and it’s fulfilling because I’m working on a really, really fundamentally difficult problem,” Felkner said. “Even for languages where more data does exist, it’s an interesting and necessary problem to try to learn to do things more efficiently and use less data.”
As an undergraduate at the University of Oklahoma, Felkner said she didn’t have much access to courses that aligned with her interest in language technology, so she taught herself material before arriving at USC.
“I was trying to push the boundaries of machine translation before I even knew how to do the easy problems of the field,” Felkner said. “It made it a lot harder to learn and it made things take longer, but in some ways it was helpful because I didn’t come in with as many preconceived notions about what the limitations of certain algorithms or types of models would be.”
May said there is essentially no data to work with, as K’iche is infrequently written and documented, and none of the researchers speak the language — rendering their work rather difficult.
Felkner said she hopes to complete the K’iche’ translation system and eventually generalize the technology to other languages, while pushing the boundaries of what is considered the “lowest” amount of available data to be able to do so. 
She’s also working on an English language model designed to eliminate computer languages that have inherited biases, specifically anti-trans biases. Down the line, Felkner said she wants to become a professor to create more welcoming spaces for women and queer people in computer science departments. She feels this is increasingly important as artificial intelligence becomes prevalent in everyday interactions.
“Like it or not, AI is running our daily lives these days. Everyone has the ability and the right to understand at least how these systems work, and I want to make it possible,” Felkner said. “I want to keep doing this for resource research, and also fairness research.”
May said he commends Felkner for her commitment to her work and eagerness to continue trying to push boundaries, even when it’s incredibly difficult to do so.
“She’s indefatigable … she goes bravely where no one else has gone before,” May said. “One of my favorite things is working with somebody who’s so brave to work on these problems and come back with updates — it’s a very hard problem — and she’s able to make progress every time we meet.”

The USC Admission Center has officially retired the use of the Spring Admission Ambassadors Program nameplate and is instead transitioning into a single, holistic program as disclosed in a communitywide email earlier last month.  
“While SAAP still exists, we will no longer hire additional students for the program,” the email read. “Rather, we are moving forward with one Student Ambassador program in the USC Admission Center to support all prospective and admitted students.” 
Jessica Nielsen, executive director of student development and visitor relations, emphasized that program services aren’t being discontinued, only the title under which they fall. 
“We’re not canceling the program,” Nielsen said, “but rather consolidating our ambassador roles within enrollment services.”
Program administrators hope the change will reduce a “duplication in efforts” and increase efficiency. Since 2015, Spring Admission Ambassadors have trained and worked separately from the main admission office staff, solely for incoming spring students. Under the reorganization effort, all prospective applicants must apply, complete and assist in standard ambassador duties under one program, including those interested in working with the spring population. 
The admission center will continue to offer the spring mentorship program, provide pre-commitment information webinars for admits and provide individual one-on-one appointments with former spring admits working for the office as it did before under the SAAP. Programs like the mentorship program — a service housed within the SAAP — will remain unchanged during the transition, and will begin integrating new ambassadors with SAAP members to manage these services. Training new ambassadors in a wider range of positions will also allow ambassadors to take on more shifts over the school year if spring mentorship classes fail to fully fill, Nielsen said.
“Our department really focuses on helping [spring admits] understand what spring admission is, what their options are before they can start at USC and how they might choose to spend their fall semester,” Nielsen said. 
Ethan Galbraith, a sophomore spring admit majoring in journalism and a prospective student ambassador, used SAAP up until his arrival to campus last spring. Galbraith’s experiences with the program ultimately swayed his decision to attend USC, something he wants to share with others. 
“Those simple 45-minute, one-hour meetings over Zoom were game changers for me and I know they were game changers for other people too … I just hope this consolidation does not impact our ability to pay it forward,” Galbraith said. 
Adrian Becerra, a senior majoring in computer science, games, joined the program two years ago in the fall of 2019. Becerra was surprised when he originally heard the news, but quickly found his concerns pre-accounted for.
“In the restructure, there is still going to be an expressed effort to hire a team of spring ambassadors, so that there’s always a spring admit available,” Becerra said. 
Current spring ambassadors like Becerra who were trained under the old model will continue to provide services for spring students until their departure from the program, the last of which are expected to graduate within the next two years.  
For Galbraith, the change in title was disappointing, he said. 
“You’re already dealing with a separate set of challenges as a spring admit,” he said. ”It’s a specific set of students that are here specifically for you.”
However, after attending a Sept. 1 information session, Galbraith said he felt increasingly reassured about the transition and its continued impact. 
“They were very honest with us in that not everything was figured out yet,” he said. “I thought to myself, okay, that’s totally fine … I’m a full supporter of it. I’ll support it until they give me a reason not to.”

Content warning: This column includes mentions of graphic violence.
Queen Elizabeth II died Sept. 8 at the age of 96. But you already knew that: You’ve read the countless articles and obituaries, seen the front pages of British newspapers or scrolled through Tweets convinced that she was reincarnated as Trisha Paytas’ newborn child. Maybe (God forbid) you found out about her passing because The Shade Room posted about it on Instagram or Twitter. 
Whatever the case, the news was — and continues to be — inescapable. It seems the media is adamant on emphasizing that thousands, if not millions, are mourning the Queen’s death. Western leaders and their allies have been doing the same, calling her everything from a “source of comfort and pride” to a “kind-hearted queen,” who “will forever remain in the history of mankind.” 
These statements are true, but they are partial truths. I’m going to take a wild guess and assume that you, the average American reader, don’t care. You might even be asking: “It’s the 21st century; who cares about the British monarchy anymore?”
Great question. Let’s break it down. First, here’s who cares: Western media and leaders, the Royal Family and — whether they like it or not — Britons. Here’s who doesn’t: pretty much everyone else. 
More importantly, here’s who couldn’t be happier about the news: (most) former British colonies.
Britain
After his mother died, the newly crowned King Charles III declared a period of Royal Mourning until seven days after the Queen’s funeral — and that Sept. 19, the date of the funeral, would be a bank holiday. Every corner of Britain is facing closure or postponement: schools, post offices, supermarkets, restaurants, social services and even football games.
Did I mention there’s a cost-of-living crisis? Inflation is at its highest in decades, and U.K. residents are struggling to pay their energy bills with declining wages. Britons have been waiting and waiting, even going on strike, for their Parliament to do something, but while the Queen was alive, the government was too busy electing its new prime minister (who is now proposing such helpful measures as rescinding anti-obesity policies). Now, it is too busy waiting until after Monday’s funeral.
To rub salt in the wound, food banks — on which millions now depend — are closing for the funeral. Hospitals are canceling or rescheduling appointments, including surgeries. Police are also arresting people for “disturbing the peace” by protesting (or carrying eggs) near mourning sites. As the Queen’s death leaves Britons suffering, it is difficult to imagine that the dwindling support for the monarchy, especially among younger generations, will recover anytime soon.
Former British colonies
When the Queen took the throne in 1952, her country was carrying out violent counterinsurgency campaigns against her subjects. In Malaysia (then Malaya), the British army declared a Malayan Emergency, then forcibly relocated upwards of 400,000 people, massacred dozens of villagers and allowed headhunters to decapitate and scalp corpses to keep as trophies. In Kenya, after decades of forcing the Kikuyu out of their own lands and into poverty, Britain quelled the subsequent Mau Mau rebellion, killing thousands in combat and imprisoning (“re-educating”) even more in concentration camps.
Only in 2013 did Britain apologize for its torture of Kenyans. For its other atrocities — its bloody partition of India, its abuse of Iraqi detainees, its theft of the Kohinoor diamond, its murder of South African prisoners and more! Queen Elizabeth and her regime have remained silent. One can imagine the joy of a people learning of their complacent oppressor’s death.
I mentioned earlier a notable exception: Hong Kong. Its years under British rule were often turbulent, fraught with anti-colonial protests and briefly interrupted by Japanese occupation. Nonetheless, fueled by colonial nostalgia and defiance against China, thousands are waiting in line each day to pay their respects at the British consulate. 
Honorable mentions
For critics of the monarchy, and nations wanting to leave the Commonwealth, now is the optimal time: King Charles III is far less popular than his mother, even after a recent surge in approval ratings. 
But anti-monarchist groups are staying low for now. The pressure group Republic offered muted condolences, saying it “must respect the family’s personal loss.” Besides a giant banner on its website reading, “#NotMyKing: An affront to democracy,” it has yet to announce any large-scale action. Protests and hecklings against the Royal Family since the Queen’s death are mostly isolated incidents. (#NotMyKing went viral on Twitter after a protester holding a sign with the slogan was escorted away by police.)
Several Caribbean nations — Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, The Bahamas, Jamaica, Grenada and St. Kitts and Nevis — are at least considering removing King Charles as head of state and becoming independent republics. Sinn Fein, the Irish-nationalist party, is now the largest political party in Northern Ireland; its leaders are treading lightly, but questions remain as to whether the new king can hold the union together.

The third season of “Never Have I Ever,” directed by Mindy Kaling, was recently released on Aug. 12, and the internet is once again tied up in controversy regarding the accuracy of the Indian American main character, Devi Vishwakumar. This confused, witty and oftentimes, irrational teenager played by Maitreyi Ramakrishnan is one of the first mainstream Indian protagonists to be featured in Western media. 
When this show first aired on Netflix in April 2020, many first-generation South Asian communities were ecstatic to finally watch a show that they could finally relate to. After growing up with South Asian representation in western media being the stereotypical and hardly representative Ravi in “Jessie” and Raj in “Big Bang Theory,” I hoped that Devi would finally redefine what it meant to be South Asian in Hollywood, and in large part, she did do that. But while millions of viewers found great comfort and related somewhat to Devi’s experiences, millions of others were disappointed by the lack of accuracy and the problematic messages that her character and the show conveyed, such as degrading comments about Indian people and culture, including repeated ideas that they’re “unattractive” and “uncool.” 
As of 2015, there are about five million individuals of Indian descent living in the United States, each with their own story to tell. Some grew up in smaller towns where they were the only people of color and were conditioned to feel ashamed about their heritage, while others grew up going to 90% Asian high schools, but dealt with different cultural stigmas and pressures than the former group. To try to find one story that fully represents these two groups, as well as millions of others, is nearly impossible. Kaling herself says that Devi’s character is based on her childhood growing up in Boston, and Devi’s experiences and thoughts closely resonate with what she used to feel growing up. 
Although shows like “Never Have I Ever” are major steps in the right direction for representation in Hollywood, featuring main characters from underrepresented groups immediately becomes a social statement (whether the director intended so or not) due to the scarce representation of those groups in media. All of a sudden, one character and story holds the responsibility of appealing to and representing an entire diaspora of millions of individuals, all while simultaneously telling an engaging and complex story. 
While the majority of television protagonists: white, cisgender and heterosexual characters, are judged simply for their actions and personalities, underrepresented characters are judged automatically for the social messages they send. 
Beyond “Never Have I Ever,” other shows featuring underrepresented groups, including LGBTQIA+ characters, individuals with disabilities, Indigenous Americans and more, all fall under this same trap. 
We set ourselves up for failure when it comes to representation in the media, since we expect a character that will be able to do the impossible and speak for everyone, and in the end, we sacrifice much of the importance of the story or the depth of the characterization itself. 
At the end of the day, many people want to see inclusion in media without having to address all the trauma and discrimination that they go through in their real lives outside of the theater. Films can oftentimes be an outlet, and having the majority of media that features diverse groups of people simply focus on the negative aspects of the viewers’ experiences leaves no escape from their pain and struggles. 
Directors like Kaling have said that by focusing less on the identity of a diverse protagonist, we can normalize the inclusion of underrepresented groups in stories outside of just their identity. By putting pressure on diverse characters to tell a social message, we reduce them to just their identity and simultaneously reduce an entire group of individuals to one story. However, at the same time, it is important to recognize the responsibility that this flawed system puts on creators; underrepresented groups will always tell a story, regardless of whether the director intends to do so or not. Therefore, directors should use that responsibility wisely to avoid further stereotyping these groups of people. 
Through all of this, we discover that there is no right answer or formula for how to represent the underrepresented. These problems won’t be solved with just a few stories. For now, the only solution is to continue telling the stories of and giving leading roles to the underrepresented groups that never saw themselves on the screen. While characters such as Raj, Ravi and Devi can’t possibly represent every South Asian, it gives me hope that one day seeing actors like them and those from other minority groups on the screen will be the expectation rather than the exception.

USC women’s volleyball won all three of their games at the 2022 Trojan Challenge without giving up a single set, bringing their season record to 8-3. 
The Trojans defeated New Mexico State in 3 sets Thursday. Senior outside hitter Skylar Fields and sophomore setter Mia Tuaniga led the team with 13 kills and 26 assists respectively. The first set saw the Aggies take two 4 point leads late in the game, but the Trojans came back to take the win at 26-24. Following the slight misstep, the Trojans won the next \ two sets decisively at 25-17 and 25-16 respectively. 
On the second day of the Trojan Challenge, USC took just 3 sets to defeat the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Friday. The Trojans opened the first set on fire, making quick work of the Panthers with a 25-14 win. Milwaukee was more of a threat in a second set that saw 610 lead changes and a late 26-26 tie before freshman outside hitter Jordan Wilson put the game away, winning 28-26. In the final set, USC controlled the lead and finished strong, winning 25-17.
USC faced off against San Jose State on the last day of the tournament Sunday trouncing the Spartans in 3 sets. The first set started off close but eventually the Trojans were able to pull through and win 25-21. The team played cohesively in the next set, propelled by 5 kills from Wilson and won at a decisive score of 25-15. The Trojans were able to clinch the victory in the last set with a score of 25-21, backed by 9 kills from Fields even in the face of several service errors. 
Head Coach Brad Keller credits the team’s ability to execute for their win Sunday. 
“I felt like there were highs and lows to the game,” Keller said. “When we really needed points when we needed to make plays, I think our girls stepped up.”
Fields felt that one of the keys to the team’s success was the performance of the team’s middle blockers. 
“They did a really good job lining up with the hitters, getting good touches so it was really easy for [senior libero Keila Barra], [freshman libero Gala Trubint] and I to play back row defense,” Fields said.
Against San Jose State, Fields led the team with 16 kills while only recording two errors. Although the team won in a sweep, only allowing the Spartans to score 21 points in their first and third set, Keller still felt the Trojans showed room for improvement. 
“Yeah there’s a lot of things we could improve on,” he said. “Honestly serving the ball … in that last set we had like 6 or 7 service errors which was ridiculous. I think touching the ball better, just controlling the touches.”
Fields held similar beliefs on what she needed to improve on for the upcoming season.
“For me it’s all about the passing and serve game that’s really what I’m trying to improve my skill on,” Fields said. “But also I think we did a really good job today blocking. We worked on that all week,” Fields said. 
Coming off the momentum of their win streak, the team has championship aspirations in sight. 
“I think our biggest goal is hopefully a good run in the tournament and win a national championship but right now we’re focused on the Pac-12 championship,” Fields said. 
“When you come to SC, no matter what anyone says or how a team is good or bad, you need to compete for championships. That’s what this school is about, and it will always be about that,” Keller said. “The goal is to play at that level and be consistent playing at that level and we saw glimpses of it, but it hasn’t been consistent.”
Next week’s matchup against UCLA marks the start of the Trojan’s Pac-12 season. Since 2000 the USC women’s volleyball team is 25-18 against UCLA. 
UCLA is off to a 6-3 start and has split their previous 4 matches, including a recent loss to the University of San Diego. The Trojans will face off against the Bruins Sept. 22 in Pauley Pavillion.

Men’s tennis kicked off their season at the Southern Intercollegiate Championship in Athens, Georgia this past weekend. Facing off against the University of Virginia, University of Texas and the University of Georgia, USC came away with only 11 wins across 28 total singles and doubles matches throughout the weekend. 
The Trojans had high hopes coming into this tournament, with the No. 1 ranked Intercollegiate Tennis Association singles player and reigning SIC winner, senior Stefan Dostanic, leading the charge. Besides boasting the defending champion, USC seemed strong-footed, having won over half of their total games in this same tournament a year ago. The Trojans and their six top 100 ranked singles players and two top 100 ranked doubles teams looked poised to duplicate such success; however, it did not go as well as anticipated.
USC started the weekend facing off against the Cavaliers, with seven singles players playing and three doubles teams. It wasn’t long before No. 1 ranked Dostanic was dethroned, as he lost his first match of the day in singles and then lost later in doubles with sophomore Wojtek Marek. Donstanic’s usual doubles partner, graduate student Bradley Frye, was able to win his match against Virginia and gain a positive in an otherwise lackluster performance from USC on day one. 
Day two against the Longhorns showed more positive results for the Trojans, as most of the matches went a full three sets. Yet, Texas still had the upper hand in the majority. Dostanic earned his first win of the tournament Saturday as he defeated No. 16 ranked Micah Braswell in a match where Dostanic battled back after dropping the first set. USC also showed more fight in the doubles matches of the day, taking two out of the three doubles matches.
Day three against the Bulldogs was rather disappointing for the Trojans, as they only mustered one singles win on the day but were able to once again take two out of three doubles matches. It would take all the way until game three, however, for USC’s No. 2 ranked doubles team of Dostanic and Frye to get their first win of the year. They took down Georgia’s doubles team of fifth-year Trent Bryde and redshirt freshman Ethan Quinn with a score of 8-6. This was only the pair’s second official match of the year together, but there are still high hopes for the rest of the season.
“Stefan and I had a pretty good year last year… but today it was just kind of nice playing out there together again,” Frye said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.” Obviously, [Saturday] we didn’t have that good of a match… but today we were able to feel pretty healthy and that ended up being good, and obviously we’re super comfortable playing with each other so it was fun playing with him and being out there again.”
While USC’s SIC performance fell short of that of last year, with this being the first tournament of the year, the Trojans and head coach Brett Masi look to use this as a springboard for the competitions moving forward for the rest of the year.
“That’s the first thing, just kind of getting more steady and consistent work in, and also hopefully we can continue to get some individual stuff and maybe use some of the video from this week to help us grow,” said coach Masi. 
Like many others, Frye and the team have high expectations for themselves this season, and know there’s always a target on their back given USC’s status. However, he and the team hope to return stronger and better than ever next time they hit the courts.
“Really at the end of the day, I think it’s not going to be so much about the other team, but really about our team,” Frye said.  “As long as we prepare well, train well, practice well, by the time season comes, I think we’re ready to go and we’re able to just give our best every match.”
The Trojans have some time off from competition, as the next time they hit the courts will be Oct. 1 to Oct. 9 in  Tulsa, Oklahoma for the ITA Men’s All-American Championships.

The USC men’s water polo team traveled to Northern California for the 2022 Aggie Roundup this weekend, securing two wins against No. 6 University of California, Davis and No. 20 United States Naval Academy, but falling to No. 5 University of the Pacific. The Trojans are now 8-2 for the season. 
In their first game of the weekend, the Trojans faced the Tigers at their home pool in Stockton. USC and Pacific ended the first period tied at two goals each, with junior Carson Kranz and redshirt senior Jake Ehrhardt scoring the Trojans’ first two points. In the second quarter, USC and Pacific continued to go back and forth, with goals for the Trojans scored by freshman Andrej Grgurevic and graduate student Massimo Di Martire. Di Martire, last week’s MPSF Newcomer of the Week, racked up two back-to-back points before the end of the period; however, the Tigers answered with two more goals, pulling ahead by one point by halftime. 
The third quarter ended with USC securing three goals from senior Marcus Longton, Ehrhardt and Crantz, but Pacific scored four goals, taking a two point lead. The fourth quarter was an offensive frenzy, with the Trojans and the Tigers each scoring five goals in the period. Redshirt senior Ashworth Molthen, redshirt sophomore Joshua Waldoch, and Ehrhardt all scored, but Pacific’s two-point lead held until the final buzzer, giving the Trojans their second season loss.
“It’s clearly the defense,” said Head Coach Marko Pintaric regarding the loss. “The team did not execute [their] defensive assignments to the ability they can, and, in a nutshell, that is the reason we lost the game.”
While USC had a solid offensive run throughout the game, their defense is how the Tigers took home a win. 
“We need to really change our attitude, the way we train and the way we approach the game in every situation,” said Pintaric. 
And that’s exactly what they did. The Trojans turned things around the following day, facing the Aggie Roundup hosts along with the Navy Midshipmen, who they hadn’t competed against since 2010. These matches provided an opportunity for newer faces to get some action, and that’s the precise opportunity that goalies Kyle McKenney, (graduate student), and Eric Hubner, (redshirt freshman), took. 
In the first match of the day against UC Davis, the Trojans shut out the Aggies in the first quarter and scored five goals. The first half of the game was dominated by junior Max Miller, securing a career-high of four goals in the first two periods of play. The Aggies scored three of their total four goals in the second quarter but were shut down by USC’s defense and goalie McKenney. McKenney ended the game with 12 saves and two shutout quarters, and the Trojans took the win. 
“Kyle played very good, phenomenal, I’d say. Defense was a little tighter … he had more time to react to those shots than Blake [Jackson] in the game against UOP, but again excellent performance, [really] satisfying for a coaching staff and very promising for incoming games and tournaments,” Pintaric said. 
In the weekend’s final match against Navy, USC hit a six-goal streak after the Midshipmen scored first. With one second left on the clock for the first period, goalie Hubner launched one in from across the pool, scoring the first ever goal by a goalie in USC’s records. Hubner’s performance this weekend earned him MPSF Newcomer of the Week. USC led 8-2 by halftime, holding Navy to one goal in the first and second periods and completely shutting them out in the third. 
“I’m very pleased with the way [Hubner] performed in the game. He was really right on the ball, and his reaction time was great, so very promising for a young goalie, and I really think he’s going to have a very bright future,” said Pintaric. 
By the fourth quarter, Navy gained some momentum but with both teams securing three goals each, it wasn’t enough to come back. USC took their final win of the tournament 14-5, and Hubner ended the day with 14 saves. 
“I’m very happy [with] the way the team turned it around and, on quick notice, took most of the problems from Friday and adjusted it to Saturday’s game,” said Pintaric. 
The Trojans will head to Palo Alto next weekend for the Mountain Pacific Invitational, with their first game against Fordham University on Friday.

There is no better duo in L.A. sports than 1. A period of sudden success after a long period of turmoil, and 2. Every fan of that team declaring “we’re back” — and it’s happening right in front of our eyes with USC.
Look, I get it — the Trojans are good, really good. But, how good is the question?
See, if you’ve read my columns in the past, you’ll know me as a positive outlook person, a rarity among Los Angeles sports fans. Whenever fans lose faith in a team, I roll out my carpet of positivity to hopefully change their minds. 
In this case, I’m not completely sold by this team. Now, before you close the tab or throw away the paper, hear me out. 
The last time USC started a full season 3-0 was 2017, when the Trojans knocked off four straight wins to start the year. USC went 11-3 that season, which included a marquee bowl game appearance and the Trojans’ most recent Pac-12 Championship. 
Since then, well, how much detail do I need to go into? 
USC hasn’t won a single bowl game or conference championship since then. The Trojans have notched 19 wins to 14 losses between 2018 and 2021. A program with a storied history evolved into the biggest punching bag in college football. 
But now, USC football is finally relevant after multiple seasons of mediocrity and flat-out embarrassing play. No more “Fire Clay Helton” chants or Twitter mentions flooded with “Hire Urban Meyer” accounts. The Trojans have their guy now — Lincoln Riley. 
And behind one of the more unique rosters in college football history, Riley has led USC to a quick 3-0 start and No. 7 ranking in the AP Poll, its highest ranking since, wait it can’t be, 2017. 
The offense is explosive, averaging a ridiculous 50 points per game through three matchups. The yards per game are eclipsing 500 per game — the Trojans haven’t averaged that many yards per game in an entire season since 2005.
The defense is, well, still a work in progress, but promising. Last year’s defense was quite possibly the worst in USC history. It allowed 409 yards and 31 points per game. 
So far, it’s almost day and night for the Trojans this season. No opposing team has scored over 30 points yet and USC has done a strong job of forcing turnovers — 10 in three games compared to six through the same total last season.
Those numbers may be difficult to keep up, but it’s encouraging to see a defense make big plays when a team is on the doorstep for points. There’s still a long way to go as Stanford and Fresno State both had long, comfortable drives for touchdowns, but a good sign overall. 
All of this leaves fans rightfully excited. A team that’s as spectacular as this one will bring any former USC fan back to the L.A. Memorial Coliseum. The Trojans haven’t been this good in years, and the stench left behind by Helton makes everything Riley brings refreshing. 
I’m in the same boat. As sports editor of the Daily Trojan last year, covering a 4-8 football team became an unenjoyable outing. I began to dread game days, wishing the Trojans could at least make it interesting and show some life even while down 20. 
Most of the time that wasn’t the case and USC’s losses numbed the experience of covering a program like this one. I had been to the last Rose Bowl victory in 2017. I remembered the glory days of the Trojans. I hoped it would return before I entered one final year of USC football as a student. 
And for the most part, the Trojans are back, but, I ask you to hold on and wait. 
USC has yet to play a program with an equal amount of talent. Rice University, Stanford and Fresno State are solid names with minimal talent, completely outmatched by the Trojans’ superteam of an offense. 
Outside of the Rice thrashing, there have been some moments when the outcome might have been shifted. 
Stanford ran all over the Trojans on the road, but two costly goalline turnovers turned the game upside down. 
Going into halftime against the Bulldogs, USC was up 21-10 and then senior starting quarterback Jake Haener exited the game due to an injury on the first drive of the second half. Fresno State managed just one touchdown for the rest of the game. 
Would Haener, who threw for over 300 yards in the Bulldogs’ first two games, lead them to a win? Probably not, since no one can compete with USC’s offense.
But it’s not wrong to believe that the Trojans haven’t played real competition yet. The schedule is lenient for Riley with no Oregon or Washington in the regular season. USC plays a struggling Notre Dame team at home, but it will have to travel for a meeting with Utah. 
Maybe I’ll buy into this Trojan team after a win in Salt Lake City. But for now, as Lee Corso says, “not so fast,” USC fans.
