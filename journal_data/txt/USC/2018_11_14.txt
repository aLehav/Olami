Returning home after an 86-50 away routing of Long Beach State, the women’s basketball team looks to improve to 3-0 after Thursday’s home matchup against UC Santa Barbara.
The Gauchos, another Big West team, will be looking for their first win of the season following a pair of single-digit defeats to Utah Valley and Cal State Bakersfield to kick off the season.
After narrowly missing the NCAA Tournament in 2017, the Gauchos went 12-17 in head coach Bonnie Hendrickson’s fourth season. Even though the Gauchos had a losing record, they put up a winning conference record of 9-7, matching the season before. The Gauchos are a team that the Trojans cannot underestimate, as they have made it to the postseason in 21 of the past 25 seasons.
UC Santa Barbara is led by sophomore guard Bri Anugwom and junior center Natalia Bruening. Despite two tough losses, the duo has combined for over 30 points per game. In addition, freshman guard Lauren Lee has had a quiet, yet efficient, start to her college career. She is the most involved freshman on the team, having played a total of 36 minutes and shooting 80 percent from the free throw line.
“I think it will be a good game,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “[UCSB is] usually on top of the Big West. It’s just going to be us going out there and taking care of what we do. We have to get more efficient on both offense and defense.”
The Women of Troy are led by a three-headed backcourt monster consisting of the Moore sisters, junior point guard Minyon Moore and senior guard Mariya Moore, and senior point guard Aliyah Mazyck. The trio accounted for 53 of the Trojan’s 86 points in Sunday’s win at Long Beach. 
An important aspect of USC’s early season success has been the team’s defense. Through eight quarters of play, the team has forced over 40 turnovers and held opponents to under 15 points in six of those quarters. The anchors of the pesky Trojan defense are the same ones orchestrating things on the other side of the ball — Mazyck and  Minyon Moore. 
Both Minyon Moore and Mazyck were members of the 2017-18 Pac-12 All-Defensive Team, with Mazyck impressing enough to be a finalist for the conference’s Defensive Player of the Year award. The defensive duo tallied six steals in their first outing together after Mazyck missed the first game of the season for undisclosed reasons.
“I don’t worry about them,” Trakh said. “How much they’re going to improve in the middle of the season is up to them. They need to keep playing the way they have been.”
Long Beach State’s Shanaijah Davison had scored 34 points the game before, but Mazyck held her to only 1 point.
Kicking off her senior season, Mazyck showed no signs of hesitation as she let it fly from all over on Sunday, leading the team in field goal (15), free-throw (6), and 3-point attempts (11). Expect that green light to shine even brighter as the senior guard takes place in her last opening night on Thursday.
Despite an undefeated record, the Trojans have had their fair share of early season woes. 
Perhaps the most alarming of those woes for Trakh and Co. has to be the large numbers of turnovers. The team has blown out its first two opponents by an average of 27 points in spite of almost 17 nightly turnovers. While early-season miscues may be justifiable, more protection of the ball is expected from a team whose primary ball handlers, Mazyck and Minyon Moore, are upperclassmen. 
Assisting them in offensive duties so far has been  Mariya Moore. The 2017 Naismith Trophy Watch List member is averaging 12 points per game on 38 percent shooting, but look for those numbers to increase as the Louisville transfer gets her feet back under her after a year of sitting on the sidelines.
The Women of Troy return home as they look to continue their undefeated season against the winless UC Santa Barbara team Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.

Redshirt junior guard Derryck Thornton dribbles the ball against Vanderbilt. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
After men’s basketball’s 82-78 loss to Vanderbilt on Sunday, head coach Andy Enfield said that his team is looking for an identity amidst multiple injuries to start the season. The Trojans will face Stetson Wednesday night at home in an opportunity to establish themselves on ball movement and defense, both focuses for Enfield.
“That’s who we are and who we try to be,” Enfield said. “We’ve been very successful the last three years doing so. We just need to get healthy and have everybody gel together.”
With such a tight margin of defeat, it’s worth wondering if USC could have beaten a talented Vanderbilt team if the Trojans were at full strength. Freshman guard Elijah Weaver is still recovering from ankle surgery, and senior Bennie Boatwright has yet to return from his knee injury. He will be a gametime decision on Wednesday.
“Bennie looks good; he’s getting in shape, and we hope to have him play this week at some point,” Enfield said. 
Boatwright said he felt good about his knee and his chances to play Wednesday. Stetson would be a good opponent for Boatwright to make his return against if he’s fully healthy, as he could have the time to find his rhythm in a game USC should win handily. 
Boatwright also said that when he does return to the court, he will focus on providing leadership for a Trojan squad that has occasionally seemed out of sorts during the first two games.
“It’s just about making smart plays,” Boatwright said. “Everybody makes mistakes, but we’re just trying to limit those.”
USC has suffered from poor starts in the early going, averaging 36.5 first half points as opposed to 44 in the second frame. In both games, the Trojans struggled with sloppy turnovers and missed shots, but became a more cohesive offensive unit as the game progressed, exemplified by an 11-3 run early in the second half against Vanderbilt that gave the Trojans a lead.
“We just needed to start running our sets and getting shots that were open for us, better shot selection and rebounding,” sophomore forward Jordan Usher said. “And it’s pushing it and doing stuff that’s under control.”
The Trojans said they were confident that continued game reps would polish their offense and make them one of the most dangerous teams in the country.
“The first two games are always tough, people are trying to figure out what their role is, how many shots you’re going to take throughout the whole season,” junior guard Jonah Mathews said. “It basically happens every year. After the third or fourth game you get rolling, you get comfortable, you know what your role is, you know what you have to do to help the team win. I feel like that’s going to happen [in] the next few games for us.”
Stetson shouldn’t provide much of a challenge. Hailing from Florida, the Hatters are 1-1 and play in the Atlantic Sun Conference. They can’t match the Trojans’ talent, but they shouldn’t be taken lightly.
“They’re long and athletic, and they play an up-tempo game,” Enfield said. “They play very well together. So we can’t just focus on one player because all five guys can beat you at any time.”
The Hatters are led by sophomore guard Christiaan Jones and junior forward Ricardo Lynch, who have combined to average 32.5 of the Hatters’ 93 points per game thus far. Although listed at 6-foot-4 and only 175 pounds, Jones has averaged eight rebounds per game and will be a factor on the glass.
Stetson was dominant in a 116-66 win to open the season against Johnson University, but it fell flat in an 83-70 loss to Missouri State. The Hatters shot just 26-of-74 from the field, including 8-of-31 from deep. However, they did have 18 offensive rebounds, which could be an advantage against a Trojan team that allowed 19 offensive rebounds to Vanderbilt.
USC and Stetson tip off at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center on Wednesday.

Head coach Clay Helton leads his team onto the field. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
It has been a season of unfortunate events, filled with crucial injuries, losing streaks, coaching changes, a green quarterback and boos from the home crowd calling for the head coach’s firing. But heading into rivalry matchups amidst all the chaos, Clay Helton felt confident.
“I have a lot of support,” Helton said . “[Athletic Director Lynn Swann] every Monday, walks into my office and has given me nothing but, ‘Coach, we’re in this for the long haul.’”
In a team meeting, Helton addressed speculation about his job security, saying that he has a lot of support from administration.
“I just let the boys know that my plan is to be here a long time … another 15 years,” Helton said. “I’d like to do it ‘til I’m 60.”
Redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns was confident before the season and did not expect the team’s spiraling trajectory.
“Things happen, certain little knicks and knacks we had, certain little injuries we had hurt us throughout the year,” Vaughns said. “So we just [have to] overcome it and ball out for the rest of the time here.”
In practice, the team shared Vaughns’ mindset and was determined to work hard this week to beat its next opponent, UCLA. After a pedestrian performance against Cal that knocked the Trojans out of Pac-12 contention, Helton feels that the emotions behind the cross-town rivalry motivated players to bring intensity and grit to the practice field this week.
After practice ended players were putting in work on their technique to hone their craft for the game. With injuries to the receiving core this year, Redshirt sophomore Trevon Sidney was working after practice to make the most of the opportunities to play.
“We were more of a team [last year]; it’s a new team now,” Sidney said. “I feel like we still have some connecting to do. We’re just a younger team.”
Despite freshman quarterback JT Daniels’ lackluster performance against Cal, where he only threw for 180 yards, he has shown improvement throughout his rookie season.
“I see [Daniels] being more poised in the pocket and really trying to read out the defense,” Vaughns said.
Vaughns isn’t worried about experiencing new looks against UCLA, and thinks that the receivers and Daniels will find success if they communicate and stay on the same page.
Leading up to UCLA and historic rival Notre Dame the week after, the Trojans are facing more media attention than usual.
“The noise doesn’t affect me, but it affects 18-21 year olds,” Helton said. “In the heart of chaos, your leader is supposed to be the one that provides calm.”
Helton reiterated that the team’s focus at this point in the season is primarily to win football games and send the seniors out on top with rivalry wins.
“The only pressure I have is that I want our seniors to have a great experience these last two games and be able to come out with a victory,” Helton said.
Injury report
Redshirt sophomore running back Vavae Malepeai was limited with an ankle injury sustained against Cal, in addition to senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware with a shoulder injury. Junior wide receiver Michael Pittman returned to practice, but was held out of contact after a shoulder injury that kept him out of the Cal game. Senior offensive tackle Chuma Edoga is nursing knee pain and did not practice on Tuesday.

Dear the NCAA Division I Women’s Soccer Committee,
The seeding for this year’s College Cup bracket is wrong: plain and simple. 
Specifically, the Trojans were harshly penalized with a No. 4 seed despite their successful season and plethora of talented players. The Women of Troy have every right to be upset about their seeding in this year’s tournament.
For starters, the Trojans finished the regular season with a 15-2-2 record in a tough Pac-12 Conference. However, their two losses are nothing to be ashamed about. USC’s first loss of the season came against Stanford, the top-ranked team in the country, on the road in overtime. The Trojans went 90 minutes in that game without conceding a goal against talented forwards like sophomore Catarina Macario, who is arguably the best player in the country. 
Their second loss of the season came against crosstown rival UCLA 3-2 in overtime at neutral ground in StubHub Center. USC had opportunities to win it, but conceded a late goal from 25 yards out in the 87th minute of the game to force overtime and eventually lose. UCLA isn’t a bad team either, finishing second in the Pac-12 and earning a No. 2 seed in the tournament. 
The Trojans tied two games this season, both of which were on the road. The first one was against Florida State, a No. 1 seed in the bracket. The Trojans went to Tallahassee and didn’t concede a goal the entire game. The other goalless draw was against Utah in Salt Lake City. In that game, the Trojans didn’t play at their normal level due to altitude sickness. Yet, they could have won the game if they had not missed a penalty in the second half.
Of the 12 other teams given a higher seed than the Trojans in this tournament, all but three of them had more losses this season than the Trojans (Tennessee, a two seed, had the same amount of losses but more ties). Some teams ranked ahead of the Trojans, like Baylor, a No. 2 seed, and South Carolina, a No. 3 seed, had five losses on the season. Florida State, for example, lost four games this season and tied two. One of their losses came against Miami, which did not even make the tournament. The Trojans, on the other hand, only lost two games all season and both came against either a No. 1 seed or a No. 2 seed in overtime. USC did not have any bad losses on the year.
Probably the main reason behind the Trojans’ low seeding is that they do not have any notable victories. While this may be true, the Pac-12 is difficult. The conference had five programs make the tournament, and each program comfortably won their first round games by at least 3 goals. The Trojans beat both Washington State and Arizona this season, and while they didn’t win matches against Stanford and UCLA, taking those games into overtime should count for something toward the team’s resume. Add that to how they tied Florida State on the road and beat Long Beach State during the season, and, that is a pretty impressive resume.
Additionally, the talent on this Trojan squad is undeniable. The Trojans have four players on the All-Pac-12 First team: redshirt sophomore goalkeeper Kaylie Collins, senior defender Ally Prisock, redshirt sophomore midfielder Savannah DeMelo and senior forward Leah Pruitt. Only Stanford has as many players on the All-Pac-12 First Team as USC. In comparison, UCLA only has two players on the All-Pac-12 First Team. The Trojans also possess the leading goal scorer in the Pac-12 and the Pac-12 Freshman of the Year in freshman forward Penelope Hocking.
The Trojans are a fantastic team on both sides of the ball. After their 6-0 defeat to Long Beach State in the first game of the tournament, they now have scored 54 goals on the year, averaging 2.70 goals per game. Even more impressive is that the team has only conceded 10 goals all season, averaging .50 goals against per game. Collins showed off her ability all season to make important stops when called upon, and behind Prisock, teams have had a hard time scoring goals against the Trojans’ powerful defense.
Furthermore, USC was ranked No. 2 in the United Soccer Coaches Poll for the majority of the season because of its impressive display of talent all season. At the end of the season, the Trojans finished eighth in the NCAA Women’s Soccer RPI standings. South Carolina, which was ranked 18th in RPI and had five losses on the year, has given a No. 3 seed ahead of the Trojans.
However, the Women of Troy are still contenders despite their lower-than-expected seeding. They have already gone on the road to Florida State and grinded out a draw in Tallahassee, and there is no reason they can’t replicate that result or even one-up it now. USC has the talent and experience to win another national championship. Despite its low seeding, the team should not be fearful.
So, to the NCAA Division I Women’s Soccer Committee: You really messed up on the seedings in this year’s College Cup Bracket. When Dec. 2 rolls around, and this talented Trojans squad is playing in the College Cup Final, I have a feeling you’ll realize you got it wrong.
Best,
Robby Aronson

Last week, Keck Medical Center of USC settled a new contract with its workers, offering better wages and benefits. Through this settlement, importantly, the center ended its contract with Sodexo, a multinational food-service corporation that employed about 80 workers in the dietary services department. These workers now will receive higher wages and the full benefits of USC employees. Yet, this move only happened through the tireless efforts of union organizers and student activists who rallied for better working conditions. In light of this victory, it’s important to realize that organized pressure is key in ensuring that labor rights will not be exploited or disregarded at our University.
Keck began the bargaining process in March with the National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents more than 1,000 Keck workers. One of the goals the union prioritized was insourcing the dietary workers employed by Sodexo, said union organizer Irene Arellano. 
USC’s previous contract with Sodexo is an example of a neoliberal practice referred to as the “race to the bottom.” This practice involves outsourcing labor to third-party entities — in this case, Sodexo — that compete for the lowest price. Several companies compete with each other to offer USC the cheapest contract and consequently, USC employs the cheapest labor.
As a result, employees of Sodexo receive painfully low wages, usually under $15 an hour, and are left without insurance and other benefits given to workers directly employed by USC. 
There is no excuse for Keck, or any University affiliate, to seek out cheap labor. 
As of June 2017, the University has an endowment of $5.1 billion, and the Keck Medical Center generated $30 million in profits in 2016. In 2017, Keck CEO Thomas Jackiewicz made $2.7 million, a 23 percent increase from the year before, according to Arellano. It’s clear that there is no shortage of wealth, yet a large group of workers are working at the poverty level, forced to utilize food stamps and MediCal. 
The University is effectively communicating that it cares more about maximum revenue retention, rather than paying its workers enough to survive without living in poverty.
The circumstances that lead to any USC worker living on               poverty-level wages is a deliberate choice made by administrators and executives. Arellano said it best: “When you have more than 80 percent of your dietary staff in your hospital, a world class institution, earning less than $15 an hour … How can you say that you’re operating with integrity when you know that your profits and your success lie on exploiting workers?”
And USC representatives did not operate with integrity while bargaining — it dragged the process out with the National Union of Healthcare Workers. Time and again, USC chooses to not treat its laborers as members of the “Trojan Family.” 
For one of the bargaining meetings on Oct. 26, Arellano said that organizers waited five hours for University representatives to respond to the union’s wage proposal. They were told that USC would withhold its own proposal unless NUHW removed the dietary workers from the negotiations.
According to Keck respiratory therapist Noemi Aguirre, Keck management went as far as asking the representatives of NUHW to kick out one of their fellow members from the dietary staff. Officials apparently believe they have the right to tell NUHW who they’re allowed to have in the bargaining room. NUHW and its members responded by voting for a strike that would have occurred in mid-November.
Additionally, NUHW worked with USC’s Student Coalition for Labor Exploitation to delivery a letter of demands to interim President Wanda Austin. The group taking part in the action was met at the door of Bovard Auditorium by armed DPS officers and was told they could not enter the building.
Unsurprisingly, USC yielded to the workers’ demands with all due haste, ended their contract with Sodexo and incorporated the workers into the formal USC staff. But, this action would not have occurred without such pressure.
USC administrators are not consciously intending to exploit as many workers as possible. They genuinely believe that they are the most ethically-guided individuals to lead the University, but their resulting decisions appear to be informed by their own self-righteousness and the classist belief that workers simply don’t know what’s best for them. 
Various scandals at the University have shown the student body that our leaders are fallible, self-interested individuals — not bastions of liberal-minded guidance. 
Whenever we see our institutions formally excluding us from the direction of policy, we must look to each other in the name of common cause, or we’ll be left out of the privilege that our hard work deserves. 
As the very skeleton of USC’s operation, these workers certainly deserve just compensation. And until USC actively shows a genuine commitment to its laborers, we should continue to plow up the ground in pursuit of a more equitably structured school.

Those of us who expected the news cycle to calm in the days following last week’s midterm elections were sorely disappointed.
The distressing events came one after the other: There was the White House’s decision to ban a CNN journalist and release doctored footage of him appearing to strike a female intern, the spreading of baseless conspiracy theories about “election fraud” in Florida, Georgia and Arizona and President Donald Trump’s firing of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, which could jeopardize the special investigation into Trump’s 2016 campaign and its alleged collusion with Russia.
In the Trump era, time has become something of a myth.
Americans are forced to exist in a nonstop continuum of events that range from frustrating and concerning to utterly devastating. The role of politics in our day-to-day lives has vastly expanded. In exhausting (and often debilitating) times like these, all we can really do is take care of each other — and certainly, take care of ourselves. The ability to survive and fight within oppressive spaces, under regimes that operate with the singular goal of terrifying and draining us into submission, is political and necessary — and it’s an ability that only comes from responsible self-care.
To be clear, for many groups, rhetoric and policy decisions from this administration aren’t just tiresome and annoying, but mark existential threats to their ability to live and participate in American society.
For Americans who have been on the receiving end of mounting hate crimes inspired by then-candidate and now-president Trump, the Trump era has been a time of unprecedented danger. Migrant families and domestic abuse survivors seeking asylum are turned away, separated and deemed criminals. Low-income women are now vulnerable to losing access to fundamental reproductive health care that allows them to live safe and autonomous lives. Transgender people face erasure and demeaning attacks on their right to exist; LGBTQ people broadly live with the reality of discrimination; and survivors of sexual assault are repeatedly traumatized by this administration’s policies.
The ability to balance survival with active, daily political resistance is a big demand for marginalized people in America. That said, it’s absolutely incumbent on allies to help carry the weight and fight the fight on the behalf of the marginalized. Yet, even for those of us who are not directly affected, it’s OK to admit that the news cycle is exhaustive; that we’re tired, stressed, anxious and need a break.
When it comes to awful news and this administration’s dangerous policy decisions, we know there’s always something around the corner waiting for us. We can’t choose one single mountain to die on; our energy has to be smartly and responsibly rationed to ensure we have the capacity to participate in this fight and support vulnerable Americans for the long haul.
Sleeping, eating, resting, being with loved ones, streaming Netflix, sitting back and putting on a face mask — we need to prioritize our wellness in a political landscape that is hellbent on wearing us down to the point of haggard apathy. This action, in itself, is political. Doing whatever it takes to protect and maintain our ability to resist and fight back for those who can’t is a political act.
Civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke frequently about how it’s necessary to preserve one’s health through vital self-care as an act of radical activism. There’s no shame in sitting out one battle to continue fighting the war.
But, as with everything, the key to self-care is balance — ensuring that we are constantly pushing and challenging ourselves to be the most engaged citizens we can be; taking care when we must, but calling our representatives, knocking on doors and volunteering for Planned Parenthood and other vital human rights groups, when we are able.
Our priorities, values and moral beliefs will always be challenged, and stepping up and taking action might be inconvenient and require sacrifice on our end. There will always be times when we prefer to sleep in a few extra hours rather than show up to a morning volunteer shift or local rally. But in those scenarios, when we will ourselves to show up anyway, that action will be all the more powerful.

Big dreams · Junior John Lynch may be best known for his contributions to the “USC Memes for Spoiled Pre-Teens” Facebook group, but Lynch said that his comedic aspirations extend further. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
John Lynch pulled up outside my apartment in a black BMW 320i, windows down, bumping Young Thug. We were getting KBBQ at Road to Seoul, and I had fretted over my outfit for an inordinate amount of time, unwilling to infuse my best dress with the scent of smoked meat. 
John did not share my concern; he wore a cream-colored hoodie decorated with glittery palm trees that looked like it belonged in the bargain bin at Goodwill — except it was Saint Laurent and cost $850.
John is a junior majoring in screenwriting. His mom is a high school English teacher. But where did his money come from?
“World of Warcraft,” he explained. “I made all my money gaming.” 
John, 22, started playing World of Warcraft when he was 10; between 16 and 20, he played professionally under the moniker “Snugglebunny,” streaming games and competing in tournaments. In 2014, he reached the upper echelon, ranking second in the entire U.S. 
Around the same time, he figured he might as well put his earnings to work and dabbled in the stock market. He invested in Tesla, and has diversified his portfolio since. Now he stocks his closet with Gucci and Golden Goose. 
I wouldn’t call him a celebrity, per se, despite the notoriety he has accrued as one of the first administrators of the “USC Memes for Spoiled Pre-Teens” Facebook group. The page currently boasts an impressive 36,000 members — even more so, considering its inception was a mere three years ago when John was a freshman. Though he wasn’t the original founder, his heavy involvement was instrumental in its rapid rise to popularity. The banner photo is of his beloved dog, Daisy.  
The memes page functions as a sort of sandbox for John — a chance for him to flex his comedic chops, test new material and hopefully stir up some mild controversy along the way. His reputation as a gleeful polemicist precedes him; some students have taken offense to his posts that poke fun at the Greek system. But John doesn’t care; he just thinks it’s funny. 
“There’s a huge part of me that loves to provoke,” he said. “I don’t have any personal vendetta. I just love trolling people.”
He’s just another student, really. But there’s a certain aura that surrounds people who crave fame and attention, who, in their pursuit of the limelight, live life far more boldly and dramatically than me. Can you blame me for a few first-date jitters?
Fame and fortune
Even though he’d been to Road to Seoul multiple times, John didn’t know which meats to order. He said his friends usually ordered for him. He knew he liked bulgogi, so we got some, and when it arrived he speared it with a fork. 
“I don’t know how to use chopsticks,” he said. “When I eat sushi I pick it up with my hands. Or I use Fun Chops!” 
Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
John’s favorite book is “The Great Gatsby,” and it’s hard not to draw parallels between his life and Jay Gatsby’s. In his wildly ostentatious streetwear splendor, John embodies new money through and through: wide-eyed, unversed in the ways of the world and eager to indulge in all fine things life can offer to someone in the right tax bracket. 
He’s planning to travel solo to Paris this December, his first time leaving the country. He wants to go all over the world: Australia, Japan, Iceland. For now, though, he racks up frequent flyer points by jetting home to New Jersey — business class, of course. 
John drops racks on clothes to “try and compensate for [his] low self-esteem.” And that’s just the tip of the iceberg; his interest in psychology has manifested in a multitude of self-diagnosed neuroses. He struggles with depression and anxiety, stemming from a troubled childhood where his mom often left him in the care of his grandparents while she dealt with his alcoholic dad. 
It’s not enough to say that he likes his eggs sunny side up; he speculates that he takes satisfaction in the perfect, intact yolk because his life is the polar opposite. He tends to lust after the unattainable — MILFs or emotionally distant sorority girls — due to his “fucked-up upbringing” and his absentee dad, an Oedipal complex rooted in his thirst for attention.
“It’s about conditional love,” he surmised. “If you don’t get attention from one of your parents, you’re drawn to people who treat you really nicely one second and then later bail.”
His particular brand of self-aware, self-deprecating humor lends itself well to stand-up, which he’s been doing for four years. But his comedy origins extend all the way back to first grade, when he would hold court in his elementary school bathroom: “I would have a crowd of people around me, and I would make up really stupid jokes.” 
He’s not afraid to get personal in his sets, partly as a defense mechanism, and partly as a way to distinguish himself from what he calls the “I smoke weed and live in my mom’s basement” comedy crowd. How he lost his virginity is a favorite bit, though when I asked him to elucidate, he demurred, insisting that I have to catch his act on Nov. 15 to hear the story (to which I agreed). 
The stand-up comedy show, taking place at Ground Zero Performance Cafe, is for charity, in memory of his friend Mckenna Martin, who died from suicide in April. 
He also jokes about his brain tumor, a pineoblastoma, for which he underwent surgery in 2014, a procedure that left thin grooves arcing across his scalp. They are shrouded when his hair is grown out, but when it’s shaved, he employs a rotating cast of baseball caps to avoid the intrusive ogling. 
He’s performed on and off at the comedy club UnCabaret, a gig that his screenwriting professor, Robert Ramsey, helped him land. When John was a student in his “Intro to Screenwriting” course freshman year, Ramsey took an immediate liking to him, and they have developed a rapport over the years. 
“I had a warm spot in my heart for John Lynch from the get go,” Ramsey said. “He is nothing if not an iconoclast. If you’re a stickler for authority and demand the right kind of behavior at all times, you’re gonna run into problems with John Lynch.” 
His irreverence is both a blessing and a curse. It can get him in trouble, like when he emailed a professor — no caps, no punctuation —  about slugging Jack and Coke on the plane. But there’s a certain charming appeal, too, to someone who refuses to genuflect to social conventions. Everyone gets the same version of him. There is no public or private persona with John Lynch — what you see is what you get, and he doesn’t care if you don’t like him, because he likes him. 
He’s definitely not everyone’s cup of tea either. Ramsey told me that other professors have asked him for advice on how to approach him. But the select few with whom he’s developed a relationship all share similar trademarks: an insolent sense of humor, and a fierce, vehement loyalty, a reflection of his own devotion to the people he cares about. 
His friend Lili Jenkins described him as “the kind of person when, if you need someone, you’d want him to be there … just the definition of a good friend.” And he and his partner-in-crime, Dylan Rohn, rib each other mercilessly, but ultimately, they’re ride-or-dies.
“John’s just a kid with his head in the clouds, his heart on his sleeve, a chip on his shoulder and the world in his eyes,” Rohn quipped, before his sardonic tone sobered into earnest affection. “It’s easy to forget sometimes that John is a human being, ’cause he’s such a big personality. He’s like a whirling dervish, in the best way possible.”
Name in lights
John wanted ice cream after KBBQ, so we headed to Jeni’s, an ice cream parlor with hip artisanal flavors. He was restless, his attention span a hummingbird, darting from one interesting thing to the next. He changed his mind at the 11th hour and asked for brown butter almond brittle, even after the server already brought him a scoop of the chocolate-flecked salted peanut butter. Our conversation often devolved into digression and tangent; once, he put me on hold to pine over a Labrador retriever in the distance.
There’s no wonder that, when considering his future, he’s unwilling to settle on a single career path. When asked where he sees himself in five, 10, 20 years, John is a veritable jack-of-all-trades, confident in his ability to succeed in any venture he chooses.
“Five, probably on ‘Saturday Night Live,’” John said. “Ten, I want an Oscar. For screenwriting, acting … I think I can direct too, ’cause I got good vision. I think I got one really, really good movie in me. I got a good TV show too. And if anyone wants to put me on a track, I think I got one guest feature in me.”
Then, after he’s made his mark on the entertainment industry, he wants to try his hand at politics and “do some good.” 
“Maybe it’s naive, but I want to make a difference,” he said. “Oh, and I want to buy my mom a house.”
Clearly, the kid’s got big dreams. But for now, his day-to-day routine looks a lot like any other 22-year-olds: wake up, brush teeth, shower. He might pop in and say hi to some of his classes. Or you could find him playing a pick-up game on the basketball court, even though “people on the west coast can’t hoop.” Or maybe he’ll be putting the finishing touches on his screenplay, an autobiographical account of his experience with cancer, which he hopes to produce this summer with Dylan’s help. 
The point is: Life is good. The future is good. 
A regular guy
Night had fallen, and on the ride back, I plucked up the courage to ask about the handicap placard dangling from his rear-view mirror. Was it for his tumor? 
“No, it was my dad’s. I just took it after he died,” he said matter-of-factly. 
He rattled off a series of tragedies he’s weathered, dating back to 2012: John’s grandfather died that November, then his dad died in December 2016, then his grandmother eight months later. And then Mckenna died last April.
“That’s kind of where everything became a bit much for me,” he said.
The radio blasted 2000s pop punk. The garish, disconsolate lights of Koreatown flashed by. I wasn’t sure what to say — I’m sorry? For what? For being dealt lousy hands in life, over and over again? 
But then John spoke up again: “I’ve had a great life overall. I would never change anything that’s happened to me. I’m very grateful. I have so many great people who love me. I love USC. I love the world. I have so much love for everything.”

From Nov. 10 to 11, Kanye West, Kid Cudi, Tyler, the Creator and nearly 40 other artists performed at Dodger Stadium for the seventh edition of Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival. Since its inception in 2012, the music festival has expanded to two days, enlisted more acts and, in its most recent iteration, moved to a larger venue. The carnival has sold out every year, and 2018 was no different. 
Camp Flog Gnaw, however, is no ordinary music festival. The “Gnawville” thoroughfare featured carnival rides and games, extensive dining options and merchandise booths, offering patrons an opportunity to experience a music festival in a whimsical carnival setting. Unfortunately the lack of cell phone service hampered the new Postmates ordering system meant to help patrons skip the line at select food trucks.
On Saturday, indie band Slow Hollows opened the festival with additional performances from R&B artist Raphael Saadiq and Odd Future member Mike G. Later. Later in the day, Louis Vuitton menswear director Virgil Abloh performed a DJ set mixing hit songs from artists like Sheck Wes, Drake and Kanye West. 
As the sun began to set, Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti delivered one of the most energetic performances of the festival, constantly commanding the crowd to open up a mosh pit. However, it was disappointing for fans to see his act cut short during  “Magnolia” because of scheduling. 
Rapper A$AP Rocky took the stage next, opting to stick to songs from his new album “Testing.” The rapper previewed a new song featuring Tame Impala, but poor sound quality overshadowed his performance.
After Rocky, rapper Tyler, the Creator performed a spectacular set flanked by large trees and a cabin to align with the festival’s camp theme. He also expressed his gratitude by thanking the crowd for the opportunity to organize the festival.
“I think it’s beautiful that I created something where all you weird motherfuckers can come and be safe,” Tyler told the crowd. 
Rapper Pusha T finished with an electrifying performance, despite drawing controversy for displaying the words “Fuck Drake” on the screen behind him.
Despite a lack of energy from many crowds throughout the early half of day two, everything changed once hip-hop group Flatbush Zombies came out; people crammed into the railings and sang along passionately to a majority of the songs. 
Eventually, rapper Jaden Smith came out performing his hit song “Icon” twice, calling Tyler, the Creator, his “fucking boyfriend,” and inviting the fire marshal threatening to shut down the event to his birthday party. 
Twenty years after of the release of her transformative album “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,” singer Lauryn Hill arrived 20 minutes late to her set, performing a few songs like “Ex-Factor” and “Doo Wop (That Thing)” before being awkwardly cut off to keep the remainder of the festival on schedule. 
Afterward, rapper Post Malone took the stage for a calm and collected performance. He ran through his wheelhouse of hit songs like “Psycho,” “White Iverson” and “Congratulations” before thanking fans for their continued support over the years.
Then came the weekend’s main attraction: Kids See Ghosts, a superduo comprising rappers Kanye West and Kid Cudi. Despite an obvious lack of preparation, the duo managed to deliver an incredible performance. West and Cudi emerged from  a large, rectangular acrylic box hanging above the stage and there were no lulls in between songs over their 45 minutes on stage. The set’s tone shifted from hypnotizing to surreal through the last four songs, with West performing both “Welcome to Heartbreak” and “Paranoid,” for the first time since 2015. Kid Cudi also performed “Pursuit of Happiness” to the delight of cheering fans, before the two artists abruptly exited the stage.
Musical legends, rising stars, and current icons rounded out the festival’s large and diverse lineup spanning numerous genres, rounding off a “crazy week” — as Kanye West put it during his performance — across the United States.
The festival’s move to the grounds of Dodger Stadium also signifies its search for independence and stature within the Los Angeles festival scene, particularly with FYF Fest shutting down operation earlier this year. Poor cell service and long lines were problematic, but with more efficiency and a more diversity of performers, Camp Flog Gnaw has cemented itself as a giant of Los Angeles music festivals.

The cover of Helen Phillips’ short story collection “And Yet They Were Happy” is my favorite color — a sunny yellow reminiscent of canaries, daffodils and smiley faces.  
Not that I’d ever judge a book by its cover, but the cheerful shade made a favorable first impression, and when I cracked it open and devoured its contents, it was exactly like sinking my teeth into a sticky, sugary slice of lemon meringue pie.  
“And Yet They Were Happy” is one of my favorite short story collections of all time. Each story is a vignette, taking up precisely two pages — no more, no less. The constraint keeps them tight and streamlined, swerving the trap of getting bogged down in plot or character development. Instead, each snapshot forms a hazy, impressionistic portrait of a young couple’s life together in a big, New York-adjacent city. 
The collection is divided into 19 sections. In an interview, Phillips said she had no original intention of divvying up the stories, but found them easy to group together after realizing how she kept returning to the same themes: marriage, family, natural disasters, supernatural visitors, human fallibility, catastrophe.
The world Phillips builds is absurd, fantastical — unsurprising, perhaps, for someone who once won the Italo Calvino Fabulist Fiction Prize. (Also unsurprising, then, that I would be partial to her work, considering how I adore Calvino.) Phillips fuses the familiar with the bizarre: At the park, a grotesque creature resembling an albino squirrel with wings bites off the narrator’s finger; on the subway, commuters ignore a raging fire, breathe shallowly through their noses and make small talk about the weather. 
Some of my favorites in the collection concern a regime that orders its citizens to grow raspberries on their windowsill; an illogically long extolment of the virtues of Mediterranean sea salt, printed on what I assume must be an extremely large jar; and a government-mandated National Reproduction Day to address the low birthrate. Other memorable images include a factory where virgins are made, the Anne Frank School for Expectant Mothers and the Hall of Nostalgia For Things We Have Never Seen.
Phillips wrote the book during her engagement and first year of marriage; her experiences with the relationship subsequently wormed their way into the stories. But it’s in the final section, “the helens,” that the book turns semi-autobiographical, maintaining a precarious balance between mythology and memoir. 
Myriad Helen Phillipses find themselves in increasingly impossible circumstances. There’s a ring of identical little girls merrily cavorting, all named Helen Phillips. There’s a Helen Phillips in a cage, the zoo’s main attraction, who is gawked at by passersby. There’s a pair of elderly Helen Phillipses sipping from bone china teacups in the backyard, in the company of two lolling bronze dragons.
The couple in “And Yet They Were Happy” weather fights and floods, mistakes and monsters and yet they are happy. Phillips writes with a lively, mischievous warmth, instilling every fable with heart, humor, honesty and heartache. The result is a whimsical, poignant work that somehow captures the essence of existence. 
Perhaps it’s childish, but I’ve never lost my conviction that magic is real, humming alongside our everyday mundanity, amenable to discovery as long as you believe and know where to look. I want to crawl into the universe, simultaneously ordinary and surreal, that Phillips conjures with her haunting, lyrical prose. I want to attend the party she’s throwing for the end of the world, where everyone you’ve ever known has shown up, and raise a plastic cup sloshing with cheap red wine to an inky night sky, defiant jubilance in the face of futility.

The team interviews Xia Shuqin about her experiences during the Nanjing Massacre in the late 1930s. (Photo courtesy of the Shoah Foundation)
The USC Shoah Foundation’s documentary on the 1938 Nanjing Massacre, “A Girl and the Picture,” was nominated for best short film by the International Documentary Association in late October. 
Directed and produced by Academy Award winner Vanessa Roth and Shoah Foundation Executive Director Stephen Smith, the film follows the life of Xia Shuqin, an 89-year-old survivor, as she describes her story facing the Nanjing Massacre.
“‘The Girl and The Picture’ is about the importance of bearing witness,” Smith said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “By focusing on Madame Xia’s relationship with her granddaughter and great grandson, the film underscores the importance of transferring the memory of an atrocity from one generation to another. The film binds their families across cultures and continents and highlights their shared commitment to preserving the memory of what happened.”
The film was created over the course of six months and screened at various events, including Tribeca  and American Documentary film festivals. The creators hope that its message will impact international audiences, as they made many edits to the film to ensure its cultural legitimacy and accuracy, according to Roth. 
“I wanted to make sure that the domestic and international audience felt I was respecting and telling an authentic story,” Roth said. “I [didn’t] want it to feel disingenuous, I want to make sure that they feel proud about the story that they shared with me.”
The story is special because it focuses on the specifics of a few characters, Roth said. Instead of integrating Madame Xia’s story into a broader history, Roth felt that the film would be more effective if it related to audiences through an authentic human experience.
“My interest in [the film] was in making sure we made a film that was very human and personal to them,” she said. “We wanted to make a film through the lens of individual people … and translate that to being a story about the bigger moments in history.”
The international award recognizes world-class non-fiction films and documentaries, and each nominated film expands on the compassion and interconnectedness of the human experience, according to the IDA’s mission statement. 
“The nomination is a welcome endorsement of our commitment to ensuring that the Nanjing Massacre doesn’t fade from collective memory, or become whitewashed by revisionist narratives,” Rob Kuznia, the Shoah Foundation’s external relations coordinator, said in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
However, according to Smith, the award does more than just recognize the efforts of the team. It’s also a sign that the international documentary society deemed it an important cultural resource and is encouraging the USC Shoah Foundation to continue its efforts in historical preservation. 
“We aren’t in this for awards,” Smith said. “We play the long game, and plan to preserve and share the personal stories of Madame Xia and other survivors of the Nanjing Massacre — be it via this film, or through their testimonies — in perpetuity, no matter what.”
The award for best short film will be announced Dec. 8.

Jean Guerrero, a USC alumna and PEN Award-winning writer, explains how writing allowed her to better understand her father. She spoke Tuesday at Wallis Annenberg Hall. (Dimple Sarnaaik | Daily Trojan)
Jean Guerrero grew up knowing her father as a paranoid schizophrenic. 
To better understand him and his story, the USC alumna wrote “Crux: A Cross-Border Memoir” and returned to USC to debut her book at a talk at Wallis Annenberg Hall Tuesday. 
Guerrero’s book rejects the notion that the world is composed of dualities. Using the underlying metaphor of crossing the border from Mexico to the U.S., Guerrero said the writing process taught her that human beings should never be labeled or stereotyped. 
Guerrero said her father, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, always told her stories of his alleged travels to “escape CIA operatives.” Because of her father’s condition, Guerrero believed it was her job to learn more about his past. 
“I felt that it was my duty as his daughter and as a journalist to investigate the possibility that what he said was true,” Guerrero said. 
While Guerrero was conducting research for her book, she learned to separate journalistic work from her obsession with her father and the parallels she found between their lives. 
“I started being extremely self-destructive, experimenting with drugs, self-mutilating, and I saw the book as an opportunity to finally separate myself from my father,” Guerrero said.
During the talk, Guerrero focused on a chapter depicting the garden her family tended during her childhood. She said that the animals they owned began to die when her father became depressed. According to her, the excerpt was written to link the lives of the animals to the loss of their main caretaker, her father. 
“My awareness of death arose from my father’s deterioration,” Guerrero said. 
Guerrero explained that developing her book involved a lot of research and traveling, including going to Mexico to learn more about her father’s past, especially his childhood. Through her research, Guerrero discovered that her father’s great-grandmother was clairvoyant. 
Although his great-grandmother was praised and celebrated for her ability to “speak to spirits,” Guerrero said she thought it was ironic how her father was viewed as ill and dangerous for telling similar stories. 
“The book is all of the different rabbit holes I went into trying to figure out the truth about what was going on with my father,” Guerrero said. “One of those rabbit holes included going to Mexico where he’s from and learning that he had a great grandmother who was allegedly a curandera, clairvoyant … but she was attributed with having a gift, whereas my father was always seen as having an illness.” 
Guerrero hopes that her book will allow readers to feel less lonely and imbue them with a sense of hope. She also said she wants readers to reflect on the idea that reality is never as simple as it seems, and that people must open themselves up to different perspectives and outcomes.

Those attending the sleep out Thursday will sleep in a parking lot with a cardboard box and sleeping bag to emulate living in the street. (Annalise Pasztor | Daily Trojan)
There are over 3,000 homeless people between the ages of 18 and 24 in Los Angeles County this year, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. On Thursday, a team of 11 USC executives will join nonprofit agency Covenant House to raise awareness on the conditions homeless youth face in Hollywood. 
USC’s Chief Information Security Officer Gus Anagnos, who is on Covenant House California’s board of directors, will lead the group. The faculty members will join 29 other teams at the sleep-out, where 173 people are scheduled to attend, according to Anagnos. 
From 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., participants will sleep in a parking lot to the conditions affecting those living out on the street. Attendees will only have a cardboard box and a sleeping bag, Anagnos said.
“The idea [of the sleep-out] is no one is going to get any sleep,” Anagnos said. “That’s a real impactful moment, when you realize, ‘Oh my gosh, can you imagine what it’s like to live on the street?’”
The different groups will also be fundraising for Covenant House California by asking for donations. The money raised will provide beds for homeless young adults and other services. The agency hopes to raise $800,000 between both the Hollywood and Oakland sleep outs. Last year, it raised $614,000, according to Jillian Robinson, the Covenant House California development officer. 
The USC team aims to contribute $25,000 toward that amount, according to Anagnos. Anagnos added that although the money is important, the primary reason for USC’s involvement is to raise awareness, amplify the voices of the homeless and encourage change.
“What I’m trying to accomplish here is not only bring attention to this problem and USC taking a front and center role, but to also give our youth …. more comfort,” Anagnos said.
Laura Ponder, a director of finance and accounting in the University’s comptroller office will participate in the sleep-out. She said that it hits home knowing that the affected homeless youth age group is similar in age to the USC student population. 
The USC finance team became involved in homelessness initiatives this past year, Ponder said, but they’ve only recently begun to understand the magnitude of the city’s crisis. She also said now that they are aware of the information, they are doing all they can to help, such as participating in the sleep out. 
“[We] hope to continue to do more,” Ponder said. “I would love to be involved next year and to continue to fundraise. I sleep out and fundraise amongst my friends as an act of love.”
Ponder is looking forward to the sleep out and hopes to raise $3,000 herself. 
“I believe that no young person deserves to be homeless,” she said. “[Covenant House] welcomes each young person with absolute respect and unconditional love.”
The sleep-out will occur toward the end of USC’s student-organized Homelessness Awareness week to educate the campus community about homelessness and food insecurity. 
“This is about USC taking part in something that it believes so much in,” Anagnos said. “[It’s about] bringing awareness to this problem, and the fact that we have a number of students who are homeless.”
USC wants more students to come forward and seek out help, according to Anagnos. He said students experiencing home insecurity should contact Brenda Wiewel, the director of the USC Initiative to Eliminate Homelessness. Wiewel said that students should also go to their counselor or advisor to acess emergency funds available for students in need, and recommended the Student Crisis and Advocacy Office.
“We’ve been really focused on how we can help make sure there are resources for our own students,” Wiewel said. “We want to create a comprehensive range of options.”

Interim President Wanda Austin sent a memo to the USC community Tuesday announcing the launch of the President’s Culture Commission, which will oversee campus culture initiatives and improvements. 
Austin will lead the commission, which comprises 13 students, faculty and staff, including Keck School of Medicine Dean Lauren Mosqueda and Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Willow Bay. Undergraduate Student Government President Debbie Lee and Graduate Student Government President Joycelyn Yip will represent students on the commission. 
“They represent a broad range of perspectives from our university community,” Austin wrote.
Lee said that she is excited to serve on the President’s Culture Commission.
“I’m excited to … delve deeply into the university’s collective values,” Lee said. “I hope to be able to honestly evaluate where we are now and see how we can meaningfully act to build a thriving USC culture.”
In the memo, Austin expressed gratitude to the Task Force on Workplace Standards and Employee Wellness, which has been meeting for the past 18 months to develop recommendations regarding ways USC can improve campus culture.  
“This group … has dedicated a tremendous amount of time and energy to exploring how a large, diverse organization such as USC can become more connected and better aligned in its mission, vision and values,” Austin wrote. “The President’s Culture Commission will consider the Task Force’s recommendations on the best partners and tools to conduct such an assessment, and will keep the community informed in the process.”
The Task Force recommended that the commission conduct a transparent “values assessment” to help the University address its collective strengths and opportunities. 
Paul Rosenbloom, professor of computer science and co-chair of the Task Force on Workplace Standards and Employee Wellness, will serve on one of the commission’s faculty positions. 
“The Task Force has always considered itself to be a short-term body that was to be followed up by something more permanent,” Rosenbloom said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “The just-announced President’s Culture Commission is one important piece of this follow up that, with President Austin as chair, truly emphasizes how important the process of culture change is to our future.”
In the memo, Austin introduced the “Change Progress Dashboard,” a new website used to track the University’s progress and commitment to change. Website visitors can view the status of University initiatives regarding “Accountability,” “Transparency” and “Wellness/Culture.” 
“This dashboard, which we will populate over time with new information and details, will track key change initiatives, including our culture improvement work,” Austin wrote. 
According to the dashboard, one of the Culture Commission’s first initiatives to redraft the University’s Code of Ethics. 
“Culture change is a journey and not a simple fix, and demands a sustained focus on genuine listening, open dialogue, and meaningful follow up,” Austin wrote. “Our work on culture and values will help us become stronger as a Trojan Family.”

Sophomore linebacker Levi Jones has been dismissed from the USC football program, according to head coach Clay Helton. He was sidelined during the Cal game last weekend due to a violation of team rules earlier in the week. 
When asked about the arrest after practice, Helton declined to comment further. 
“I have one comment for you,” Helton said. “He had a team rule violation this past week and is no longer on our roster. Thank you.”
Jones was arrested at 5:50 a.m. on July 8, 2018 in South Pasadena for public intoxication, the Pasadena Police Department confirmed Tuesday. USC did not confirm if Jones’ removal from the team was related to his arrest.
Jones had 13 tackles this season through eight games. As a freshman, he played in 14 games and recorded 15 tackles. 
He is the fourth player to leave the program this season. Safety Ykili Ross and cornerback Je’Quari Godfrey transferred, while safety Bubba Bolden  withdrew after facing suspension for an off-campus incident.
Sam Arslanian contributed to this report.

On Tuesday, the Undergraduate Student Government Senate discussed and clarified an invalid motion made to indefinitely censure Vice President Blake Ackerman last week.
Ackerman was censured by senators after they received screenshots of online comments Ackerman made allegedly condoning hazing. He promptly left his chair for the remainder of the meeting once the censure was passed.
Parliamentarian Emily Donahue said the censure was incorrectly deemed “indefinite” and was reported as such in the Daily Trojan. Since a censure is not the same as removal or suspension, Donahue said the action voted on last week was invalid since censures cannot be indefinite. 
Unlike what happened during last Tuesday’s meeting, a censure does not require a member of USG to leave their seat since there are no direct consequences associated with it, according to USG bylaws, Donahue further explained. 
A valid censure would result in Ackerman temporarily yielding his chair to the speaker pro tempore, who would assume the vice president’s ability to censure. The vice president would then resume responsibilities immediately after the censure was issued. 
“Because that language was used, the censure was invalid and [Ackerman] should have been returned to his seat,” Donahue said regarding the term “indefinite.” 
The Senate addressed the mistakes made in last week’s meeting amid confusion from the audience, one of whom called the censure “petty politics.”
“All of us are trying to do our job as senators being a check for executive members and making sure that we’re all upholding the standards of integrity that we agreed to,” Sen. Meagan Lane said. 
Due to the confusion, Ackerman explained that USC Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards and USG are not conducting investigations into the allegations against him. 
USG only has authority over its own Bylaws, Constitution, Code of Ethics and Elections Code, and its authority does not include the ability to independently investigate a member of USG, according to Donahue.
“Hazing and other issues that potentially were brought up [against Ackerman] are outside of our realm, so those shouldn’t and will not be discussed in this area,” Donahue said. “We’re all students and we don’t have authority over those [issues].”
According to USG’s bylaws, a formal complaint must be hand delivered to the speaker pro tempore indicating a violation of one of the realms of USG jurisdiction stated above for any kind of action within USG to be taken against Ackerman.
No official action or investigation against Ackerman was announced by time of publication.
