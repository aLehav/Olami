The No. 4 USC men’s volleyball team is gearing up for a two-game homestand this week against UC Santa Barbara and UCLA after spending the last two weeks on the road.

“You get used to playing at Galen,” said senior middle blocker and co-captain Steven Shandrick. “You like the vibe from playing at home, and we have been getting great fan support.”
After losing to No. 2 UC Irvine last weekend, the Trojans (4-3, 3-3) returned to the gym with a fresh intensity. Even though this week will have only one full practice, the Trojans’ string of weekend doubleheaders has given them more solid practice time than they have had thus far in the season.
“This was the best Monday practice this year by far,” said coach Bill Ferguson. “The intensity level was great no matter what we were doing. And with the short week, you get the sense of being painted in a corner so you have to improve.”
UCSB (2-5, 2-1) graduated six of their seven starters from last year’s team that eliminated USC from the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championship match as well as the NCAA Final Four. What used to be one of the most veteran teams in the conference is now one of the youngest.
“There’s no talk of a grudge match in our gym,” Ferguson said. “Both teams have moved on and we’re both on another level.”
The Gauchos are tied for last in the MPSF. Similar only in name to last year’s NCAA finalist, the match is a far cry from the heavyweight bout from last year.
“This is a must-win for us. There’s definitely a little bit of that feeling of revenge after UCSB knocked us out of the MPSF and Final Four for the older guys,” Shandrick said. “They’re beatable, and if we execute … we should win.”
First serve is 7:30 on Wednesday at the Galen Center.

Plain and simple, USC coach Kevin O’Neill has been one of the unluckiest coaches in college basketball over the past three years, since taking over at USC in June 2009.
After winning the Diamond Head Classic and the first two games of Pac-10 play during his first season at USC, O’Neill’s squad was slapped with self-imposed sanctions, in an effort by the university to make amends for the actions of men who were no longer associated with the athletic program.
Last season, he then had to replace four of the top-six players from his sanction-imposed team, and, although he did so in admirable fashion, the Trojans got utterly embarrassed by the eventual darling of the tournament, VCU, in the first round.
The cards were stacked against O’Neill when the 2011-2012 season began.
Gone was Nikola Vucevic, the team’s leading scorer and rebounder from a year ago, defensive stoppers Alex Stepheson and Marcus Simmons and 3-point specialist Donte Smith.
To add insult to injury, no pun intended, the team lost its only dynamic scorer in guard Jio Fontan, when the senior transfer from Fordham tore his anterior cruciate ligament during a preseason game in Brazil this summer.
Throw in the fact that this year’s opening night starting lineup against Cal State Northridge featured two freshmen, guard Alexis Moore and guard Byron Wesley; one sophomore, guard Maurice Jones; and two transfers, redshirt junior forward Aaron Fuller and redshirt sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon. O’Neill’s work was certainly cut out for him.
So much so that I believe wins and losses should not even factor into the equation when discussing if the long-time NBA and collegiate coach should keep his job after this forgettable season concludes.
It’s nothing against his ability to coach or the character and work ethic of his players. This year’s men’s basketball team was doomed to fall short from the start.
Compile that with the season-ending injuries sustained by Fuller and Dedmon over the past few weeks, and any expectations of success would be foolish, to say the least.
There are those who subscribe to the notion that a real man makes his own luck, and if that is true, you likely would prefer if O’Neill was not retained in a few months.
USC Athletic Director Pat Haden, however, has gone on record as recently as this past weekend stating that O’Neill unequivocally won’t be fired at the end of the year.
But I caution all critics, whether they’re fans or administrators, to not come to any sort of firm conclusion just yet.
The final nine games the Trojans play this season will be more telling about O’Neill’s future than the previous 22 they’ve stumbled through.
Granted, they have as many wins this season as they have players currently in street clothes, but the final act of the 2011-2012 season should reveal just what kind of leader and motivator O’Neill is.
Throw out the standings and even the team’s upcoming schedule. It could be Washington or UCLA or Duke or UNC, that part of it doesn’t really matter much. A 5-4 stretch or a 0-9 stretch to end the season still leaves the team well outside of even a tournament bubble.
What matters is whether or not this team of young bloods, walk-ons and overmatched players can do the little things well. As O’Neill has said throughout the year, every member of this team has been forced to do more than they’ve ever been asked to do on a basketball floor. Because of that, every night the rest of the way, they will be overmatched on the court.
Nonetheless, a coach worthy of keeping his job should get his team — regardless of the roster — to out-hustle the other team, to dive for loose balls, to set hard screens, to box out, to maintain good body language in spite of the deficit on a scoreboard.
A coach worthy of keeping his job reminds his team day in and day out that it is a privilege to wear and represent the cardinal and gold. And with that privilege comes the responsibility of wearing the name and school colors with a sense of pride.
During the team’s recent nine-game slide, the glaring deficiency wasn’t a void left by an injury or lack of talent; it was a general sense of apathy when times got tough.
I am not questioning the heart or desire of any member of USC’s basketball team. I firmly believe each of them, as competitors, has a strong passion for the game of basketball. But, even when losing becomes pervasive, as it has this season, that’s never an excuse to let up or give in.
The 2011-2012 season has handed the basketball program some of the roughest lemons across the country, but it wouldn’t hurt to see O’Neill’s squad try and make lemonade out of it over the final nine-game stretch.
There isn’t much to play for these days if you measure a season only by a win-loss record, but in many ways the Trojans are playing for everything, whether it’s for the name on the front of the jersey, pride or for their coach’s future.
To succeed in this task, O’Neill need not rely on luck. After all, inspiring his team to execute the intangibles comes only from what lies within.

As President Barack Obama readies the final budget proposal of his first term, major overhauls in federal financial aid processes will be among the proposed key changes that he will introduce Feb. 13.
In a series of speeches last week, Obama outlined the foundation of a financial aid proposal that would, for the first time, link a college’s eligibility for financial aid programs, such as Perkins loans, to gauges for increased affordability and value.
Nearly $8 million in Perkins loans are available for USC students this year by the Financial Aid Office, according to Thomas McWhorter, dean of financial aid.
“We use the Perkins loans funds for some of the neediest students,” McWhorter said. “We want to give them the most attractive, the best loans, first.”
In an address at the University of Michigan on Friday, Obama discussed a proposal to increase funding available for Perkins loans — federally funded loans that are distributed by individual institutions, unlike Stafford loans and Pell grants — from $1 billion to $8 billion annually.
“We should steer federal campus-based aid to those colleges that keep tuition affordable, provide good value, serve their students well,” Obama said Friday.
The Obama administration also stressed that an “antiquated” formula, which currently dictates where federally funded campus-based aid goes, would be overhauled to meet the new approach.
During last week’s State of the Union address, Obama warned that institutions unable to curtail ballooning tuition costs would find their funding for certain financial aid programs cut.
“Colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down,” Obama said.
In addition to Perkins loan allocation, the revised formula would impact supplemental educational opportunity grants and the work-study program allocations. Perkins loans are fixed at 5 percent interest and are repaid and therefore have no impact on the federal bottom line; however, increases in the Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grant and work-study, as outlined in the proposal, could prove another burden on the federal budget.
“[Perkins loans] go out the door to universities to figure out how they can help as many students as they can,” Jennifer Grodsky, executive director of federal relations for USC, said.
In total, the proposal aims to leverage more than $10 billion to colleges and universities to pressure them to keep tuition affordable and maintain value — qualities McWhorter already sees at USC.
“Their definition of value is offering quality education that prepares graduates to gain employment and repay their loans,” McWhorter said. “Private [universities] have the lowest loan default rates. Do I think [USC] can make that hurdle? Yes.”
Joyce Fienman, a senior majoring in history who received Perkins and Stafford loans, was encouraged by the strive to expand the programs and to make them more affordable.
“For President Obama to try to add to federal financial aid programs is a sign that providing for higher education is a priority,” Fienman said.
As part of the plan to overhaul critical aspects of the federal financial aid program, the Obama administration will look to push for individualized financial aid fact sheets to help prospective students better understand the financial aid each institution can provide. The information will give students information about postgraduate earning and employment at the institution.
Many institutions call similar financial aid provisions by different terms, and this proposal will look to avoid adding any more difficulty to the already grueling financial aid process, according to Grodsky.
The more stringent informational standards could, however, make the process more difficult for financial aid offices around the country, according to McWhorter.
“I understand the need for greater transparency,” McWhorter said. “[But] I have concerns about a ‘one-size-fits all’ approach. How can you standardize letters that would apply to community colleges, vocational schools, publics and private institutions?”
Obama’s proposal to Congress will also include a call to delay an increase in the Stafford loan interest rate, which is set to double from 3.4 to 6.8 percent July 1. Stafford loans, like Pell grants, can be used by students at any college or university and are federally distributed.
The five-year hold on Stafford interest rates is coming to an end, however, and as they affect the federal bottom line, it will be difficult to keep rates low, Grodsky said.
“Everyone wants students to have access to affordable student loans. The challenge is the price tag,” Grodsky said. “Congress is going to have to help [Obama] find the money to pay for that.”
Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, and Obama’s promises during an election year make me feel warm and fuzzy all over.
zman –
1st: The reason tuition is so expensive is we go to a private university because public universities are so poorly funded that only a few are able to offer a comparable education to top tier private universities.
2nd: Take an Econ class. Have you ever noticed that most private universities range between 50-55 k/yr? That’s because less students would be able to go. Also, 99% of private colleges are non-profit which means they aren’t trying to rip you off…
3rd: A college cannot provide an education with 2-3 thousand dollars… They just can’t. That’s it.
it’s scary how clueless Obama is..
The reason tution is so expensive is because of goverment guaranteed loans which allows schools to charge WHATEVER they want because they goverment will always make the loan.. IF they get rid of the loans, the prices would collapse to about 2-3 thousand a year.

With each of their last three losses determined by eight points or less, the Women of Troy were ready to take a break from the dramatics.
USC (11-9, 5-4) dispelled a late UC Santa Barbara (8-12, 3-5) rally to take down its nonconference opponents 50-39 at home behind sophomore forward Cassie Harberts’ game-high 17 points.
Doing the little things · Senior guard Ashley Corral didn’t make a field goal Tuesday night against the Gauchos. She did, however, tally five points, six rebounds and two assists in helping the Women of Troy to victory. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Though USC’s win did not improve its conference record, it snapped a three-game skid that had pushed the team from second to fourth in the Pac-12 standings.
With the victory, the Women of Troy improve their overall record to 11-9 and maintain their distance from UCLA (10-10, 5-4), who share the same record in Pac-12 play.
“It was exactly what the doctor ordered,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “We needed a win, and we got it.”
The Women of Troy led by as many as 21 points, but the Gauchos made a late push, cutting the lead down to nine off an and-one layup by forward Sweets Underwood with 57 seconds remaining.
After senior guard Ashley Corral countered with two free throws, USC junior forward Christina Marinacci forced a turnover, leading to her own and-one layup that put USC up 14, effectively sealing the game.
USC broke out after halftime with an 11-0 run, holding the Gauchos scoreless on 0-9 shooting. Guard Emilie Johnson ended the run with a lone free throw, to which the Women of Troy responded with a 7-2 run to extend their lead to 21.
Harberts led the charge for USC throughout the game, draining 10 of the team’s first 17 points to spark several runs for the Women of Troy. She hit the double-digit mark with 6:13 remaining in the first half.
She also pulled down six rebounds, including a tip-in layup off a missed 3-pointer two minutes into the second half.
“I think I just moved well without the ball so I could find those little open seams where my teammates are really great at getting me the ball,” Harberts said.
Freshman forward Alexyz Vaioletama started for the Women of Troy with senior guard Briana Gilbreath sidelined with a knee injury. Vaioletama grabbed a career-high 15 rebounds to go with her seven points.
The game started off slow for both teams, with the score deadlocked at two apiece for nearly seven minutes. Redshirt junior guard Stefanie Gilbreath ended the drought with a step-back 3-pointer with 13:14 remaining in the half.
Even without the team’s premier defender in Gilbreath, USC held UC Santa Barbara to only six makes on 31 tries for the first 20 minutes.
UC Santa Barbara’s scoring woes could be attributed to USC’s diligence on the defensive end, where they blocked four shots in the first half alone, compared to Santa Barbara’s zero.
“It goes back to the basics — boxing out, containing and looking for shooters to contest their shots,” Harberts said.
The Women of Troy will return to conference play with a match up at home against Washington State (10-11, 4-5) Thursday at 7 p.m., followed by another home game against Washington (11-8, 3-6) at 1 p.m. Sunday.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety daily incident log between Monday, Jan. 30 and Tuesday, Jan. 31.
Crimes against a person
At 9:09 a.m. on Jan. 30, a student reported that he was sexually assaulted near Adams Boulevard and Figueroa Street.
At 1:41 a.m. on Jan. 30, a student reported that he was sexually assaulted by another student in the Biegler Hall of Engineering.
Crimes against property 
At 9:44 p.m. on Jan. 30,  a suspect smashed the rear windshield of a student’s vehicle near 37th and Flower Streets.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 2:01 a.m. on Jan. 31, DPS officers responded to a report of a female screaming near The Row’s North Alley. Upon their arrival,  the officers were directed to an intoxicated student in the alley.  The student appeared confused and told the officers that she was diabetic, so they transported her to California Hospital for evaluation.
at 12:36 a.m. on Jan. 31, DPS officers responded to a report of a non-USC male and a non-USC female involved in a dispute at 1234 37th Dr. and detained them for questioning. The male said the female was in possession of his cell phone, and she returned it while the officers were present. The male also said he no longer wanted the female living in his residence, and she left the scene without further incident.
at 5:30 p.m. on Jan. 30, DPS officers responded to a student who injured his ankle when he fell off his bicycle after colliding with a parking control arm near Childs and Watt Ways. The officers examined the student and transported him to Student Health Center for medical treatment.
At 3:05 p.m. on Jan. 30, DPS officers responded to a non-USC male who became disoriented while having blood drawn in Healthcare Consultation Center II. A Rapid Response team was at the scene treating the male when the officers came. The male was responsive and no longer disoriented.  The male was then released to continue having his blood drawn.
At 1:31 p.m. on Jan. 30, DPS officers responded to a report of a non-USC female attempting to contact staff at the Eileen & Kenneth T. Norris Dental Science Center after having been repeatedly told she was no longer welcome on the premises because of her behavior. The officers detained the female and reiterated she was no longer welcome at the dental school. The female was given a letter from the school telling her the same thing. She was released after being instructed to read it and abide by the stated restrictions.
at 11:04 a.m. on Jan. 30, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspicious item under a chair inside the Norris Medical Library. The officers saw a metal cylinder under the chair and, upon further inspection, determined that it was a weight used to tie down balloons. The officers then cleared the scene.

Parties on campus tend to involve less drinking than those held off campus, according to the Dept. of Public Safety and “Drinking at College Parties: Examining the Influence of Student Host-Status and Party-Location,” a recent study from Ohio State University.
Partying · Dept. of Public Safety said it rarely receives complaints about on-campus parties because of the supervision of residential advisors and coordinators in on-campus housing, according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle. - Jaspreet Singh | Daily Trojan
The two sources found that hosts of parties on campus consume an average of 4.5 drinks while hosts of off-campus parties average 7.5 drinks.
The study also found that off-campus party hosts tend to engage in alcohol-related behavior, such as verbal arguments, physical assault, public urination and spontaneous rioting. Researchers interviewed 3,796 students over the course of two academic years.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said residential advisers keep things under control at on-campus residences and other drinking on campus is in a controlled environment, like Traditions Bar & Grill, where security is provided by DPS.
USC owns or manages several student housing properties located off-campus and a majority of the university’s students are 21 years old or older.
“We seldom have party complaints on campus. On-campus residential halls have supervision in the form of residential advisors and residential coordinators who usually handle any disruption,” Carlisle said. “Alcohol possession by minors in the residential halls is prohibited and, for those over 21, kegs or other large amounts of alcohol are also discouraged, though rarely a problem.”
Carlisle said DPS observations seem to support the study’s results.
“Overindulgence in alcohol is often encountered on party calls,” Carlisle said.
Justin Waring-Crane, a sophomore majoring in occupational therapy, said he thinks students are more likely to drink more off campus.
“Because [students] are off campus, they don’t really feel like there would be as serious consequences because [students partying off campus] don’t have RAs leaning over their shoulders,” Waring-Crane said.
Some students, however, said the hosts drink less than the attendees for parties both on-campus and off-campus.
“The hosts feel responsible for the safety of the party and choose to be more responsible,” said Ben Badower, a freshman majoring in business administration living on campus.
Silken Weinberg, a freshman majoring in communications said the threat of residential advisers appears to be more of a concern when choosing how much one drinks and where to attend parties.
“If you’re off campus … it just doesn’t feel like it’s as much of an issue or a reason for you to get in trouble as [it is] in the dorms,” Weinberg said.
You know it’s true!
This article is ALMOST as stupid as the one that stated that getting a job is different based on major. This just in, people drink more in a bar than in class…

Identity is more than race, and race has no biological basis, said Kip Fulbeck, who spoke at The Arts of Resistance, an Uncommon Conversation at USC Dornsife event in Doheny Memorial Library on Tuesday.
“I was born in a time when in some states, my parent’s marriage was illegal,” said Fulbeck, whose father is Caucasian and mother is Asian. As a child, Fulbeck, who grew up in Covina, Calif., said his classmates told him almost every joke imaginable that referenced Long Duk Dong, the foreign exchange student from China in the 1984 movie Sixteen Candles starring Molly Ringwald. With such stereotypical Asian characters, film and television perpetuated a particular stereotype that still exists in recent movies, including The Hangover, and television, such as the CBS series 2 Broke Girls.
Artist and professor Kip Fulbeck spoke about identity and race at The Arts of Resistance, an Uncommon Conversation at USC Dornsife event in Doheny Memorial Library on Tuesday. - Adrian Hoffmann | Daily Trojan
Fulbeck, an artist and professor at UC Santa Barbara and UC San Diego, began the event by showing a short video he made featuring his son, Jack, who Fulbeck said inspires him to make art and identify “the weirdest stuff in the world,” such as why every wristwatch advertisement sets the time on the watch to 10:10.
“When I go to Ikea, I wonder why I’m the only one who is bothered I’m being treated like a mouse,” that must follow a specific pathway to navigate the store, Fulbeck said.
This sense of awareness and realization that something “normal” is abnormal or weird is what Fulbeck said is the focus on his art, books, spoken word, video and speaking events.
“Part of my job as an artist is to point out the stuff that is already out there that is really weird.”
One example that Fulbeck asked the audience of the event to answer was: “Name a movie where an Asian-American kisses someone,” Fulbeck said to a silent audience. “Is that strange to you? … I think everything’s got to be challenged.”
The event, which was attended by students, faculty and friends of Fulbeck, is part of a three-part series organized by Indra Mukhopadhyay, a lecturer in the writing program who created the series around the theme of empire, imperialism and resistance.
“So much of resistance is conceived as the opposite of what’s happening,” said Mukhopadhyay, who first saw Fulbeck speak at the University of Michigan in 1999. “[Fulbeck’s] work gets you out of this binary.”
Mukhopadhyay also said he appreciated the humor Fulbeck included in his work, which serves as a cultural analysis.
“I’m really hopeful,” Mukhopadhyay said after the event. “[Fulbeck’s] art makes you feel positive that there still is a possibility of change and hope.”
Fulbeck presented pieces from his three book projects: Part Asian, 100% Hapa, Permanence: Tattoo Portraits and Mixed: Portraits of Multiracial Kids, all of which feature a person photographed on a white background next to the person’s response to a question. In his book about Hapa identity, Fulbeck asked 1,200 participants — 100 of which Fulbeck included in the book — of all ages to write a response to the question, “What are you?” Responses varied from toddlers scribbling or drawing pictures to a man responding, “I make trash cans for a living. You think of trash, you think of Mike.”
“It’s not a book about race. It’s a book about identity,” said Fulbeck, who also said diversity encompasses more than race, including gender, economic status, physical abilities, country of origin, body type and much more.
Though “Hapa” is a slang term describing mixed heritage or roots of Asian and/or Pacific Islander ancestry, Fulbeck said the term can be loosely interpreted as participants of his project showed.
“The most important part of this project for me was that it forced me to be around people who were different than me,” said Fulbeck, who displayed this project in a five-month-long exhibit at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles in 2008, where visitors could respond and display their photos and responses to “What are you?”
“[Fulbeck’s] work is very unique and inspiring, especially as a reminder to why we’re here. He definitely gives a very unique to multiculturalism and what that movement is,” said Alanah Joseph, a junior majoring in communication. “We need more refreshing teachers [like Fulbeck] who bring energy to the room and inspire people to not be so adamant about the ‘A’ [letter grade], and focus on the learning experience in general.”

Since his first film, Quentin Tarantino has emphasized music in his movies.
Tarantino isn’t too subtle, either; he wants you to notice the tunes. From Dusty Springfield’s “Son of a Preacher Man” to Tomoyasu Hotei’s “Battle Without Honor or Humanity,” Tarantino’s musical choices are varied, yet often forgotten unless he features them in genuinely iconic scenes.

When Uma Thurman and John Travolta famously dance at the fictional restaurant Jack Rabbit Slim’s in Pulp Fiction, Chuck Berry’s “You Never Can Tell” rings out in the background, becoming an indispensable part of the scene.
And when the cast of Reservoir Dogs comes out in the beginning of their movie in slow motion, “Little Green Bag,” performed by George Baker Selection, serves as an unforgettable backing track.
It almost seems obvious to make a Tarantino musical and though this may be true, that doesn’t make the production any easier to execute.
The creative minds behind Show At Barre’s For the Record: Tarantino In Concert took the task head-on and hit it out of the park. Using the entire venue as the backdrop, the show’s extremely talented performers present a collage of scenes from the movies that’s entertaining beyond belief.
The actors transition perfectly between acted scenes and musical numbers, which often blend together.
It’s in recreated moments such as the famous torture scene from Reservoir Dogs, in which Michael Madsen’s character Mr. Blonde sadistically tortures an unlucky policeman that has been kidnapped, that the actors show how brilliant this show really is.
One can see the anguish in the poor cop’s face as he belts out “Stuck in the Middle with You” by Stealers Wheel while his tormentor waltzes up to him, suddenly taking over the tune as he gags the cop.
The show is overflowing with charming scenes like this one, taking beloved moments from Tarantino’s movies and making them irresistibly catchy through the usage of music.
The perfomers are really something else: Each member of the eight-person cast, composed of four men and four women, is a talented singer and actor.
Backed by a full band set up along the street-facing wall of the venue, the actors dive impressively into the assorted scenes from each of Tarantino’s movies without skipping a beat.
One second you’re watching the aforementioned torture scene, and the next you’re surprised from behind as a performer transitions into African-American funk singer Joe Tex’s “I Gotcha” by picking an unsuspecting audience member, covering him or her with his cape and belting out the first words of the song without reservation: “I gotcha!”
This exuberant performance of the song, delivered so aggressively by Tex, is even more memorable when done perfectly by a white, middle-aged actor that’s dancing on top of a bar and among tables. The scene’s ridiculous humor gets you in every way.
The use of the entire restaurant in this sort of 360-degree performance succeeds in making every person in attendance feel like the show is happening directly in front of and for them. There is no nosebleed section here — every seat is in its own front row.
When scenes with dancing come, audience members are pulled out of their seats and thrown right into the action, much to the merriment of everyone else in the venue. When Uma Thurman’s Black Mamba fights the Crazy 88 in her Kill Bill: Vol. 1 signature, yellow jumpsuit, she doesn’t just fight them in the middle of the stage — rather, she disappears and reappears throughout the whole room.
For The Record: Tarantino In Concert keeps you on your toes the entire duration of the show, inspiring you to try to find where the next scene will start.
Simply put, the show is brilliant — there’s no other way to describe it. For The Record: Tarantino In Concert takes a hold of you from the start and doesn’t let go until the end. The only inconvenience is the two-item food/drink minimum enforced on top of the ticket, but it’s a small criticism that most people won’t mind.
The show is truly exceptional and definitely worth it.

Rhythm and blues dreamgirl Jennifer Hudson has achieved another feat.
This January, the mother, actress, singer and Weight Watchers spokeswoman released her autobiography I Got This: How I Changed My Ways and Lost What Weighed Me Down, crossing into the literary field and adding another talent to her multi-faceted career.
Though Hudson’s autobiography is a bit heavy on her weight struggles, and at times excludes fans who just want to read about her work, it’s improved by Hudson’s “be true to yourself” mantra, which comes off as sincerely inspiring.
Before launching into the story of how she grew up as a “big girl,” Hudson pens a lively scene of her moment on the red carpet. “Jennifer,” a reporter asks, “are you insecure about being a ‘big girl’ in Hollywood?”
Her internal response — “Oh, hell no. She didn’t just ask me that” — would probably have been more comical if it weren’t so grounded in reality. Still, her emotional honesty gets her point across.
About 40 percent of Hudson’s autobiography is spent describing her experiences balancing her weight and her talents while trying to break into the industry.
This is the most intimate section of the book. She writes about buying plus-sized gowns from the few stores that sold them, getting rejected from a position to sing behind Barry Manilow and her fashion-related weight trials on American Idol.
Even for readers who are not plus-sized, Hudson’s detailed personal examples raise questions of self-acceptance. Additionally, her conversational, if imperfect, prose serves to draw in her audience.
To a point, that is. Those who know of Hudson’s dark past involving the murder of her brother, mother and nephew shortly before her wedding would be surprised to know that the subject, along with other prominent personal moments, is not mentioned at all in I Got This.
“Certain things are off-limits and should be respected,” said Hudson in an interview with The Seattle Times when asked why she omitted such a vital point in her life.
This is certainly understandable. But aside from segments about her work on American Idol and Dreamgirls, most of the intimate details of Hudson’s life are absent from her autobiography. The brief instance where she describes the moment she realized she was pregnant is as good as it gets. Hudson even skips over how she met her husband, David Otunga, and doesn’t even discuss the wedding ceremony at all. These omissions definitely put up an unwanted wall between author and audience.
In fact, the only time Hudson really reaches out to her audience is when she tries to justify her arguably drastic weight loss. Determined to get fit and set an example for her son, Hudson writes about how she signed up for Weight Watchers and shed her large frame for the slender but shapely one she has today — an act that did not please many fans.
“They [rejected] me instead of embracing me for getting healthy. One article accused me of ‘pulling a disappearing act,’ saying that I was ‘so svelte in my tangerine orange Versace dress, I nearly vanished when I turned to the side,’” writes Hudson before adding: “Well, at least they didn’t say it was too tight!”
While she succeeds in convincing the reader of the value of her weight loss, her justifications seem somewhat unnecessary and make up too large a portion of the book.
Her positive messages on self-acceptance are definitely welcomed, but at times her talk of Weight Watchers has all the annoyance of a pop-up ad. The back of the book features 25 pages of the company’s recipes in addition to coupons to join the program. In addition, Hudson spends several pages documenting the weight loss journeys of her family members who also used the system.
For those who want to enjoy a fun read about the life of a superstar, it can be a little overbearing, but perhaps the title should warn us.
Other than its product placement tactics, I Got This is enjoyable and full of personality. Though Hudson’s writing could possibly stand a little more editing, the book is quite readable and even, on some occasions, laugh-out-loud funny and profoundly moving.
Regardless of anyone says, she did a WONDERFUL job on the book. To say she is wrong for not mentioning her family tragedy….the nerve of you all. She was well within her rights to omit that from her book. And to say you didn’t know about her family tragedy…that was ALL over the news for weeks and is about to be back on the news because they are about to go to trial. But no one wants to relive such hard pain. And the book is titled “i got this, how I changed my ways and lost what weighed me down”. Her family tragedy didn’t add weight to her. Her relationship and wedding to David didnt weigh her down. She considered herself a big girl way before these things. So yes she was right to leave certain things out her book. And to not mention her wedding. That’s her business. She is a celebrity but is also as normal as the rest of us. To mention her wedding would give the media a  real day of work because they would certainly invade her space and ruin one of the most memorable day of her life. So if she wants to keep her wedding on the hush hush, I say Jen go right ahead. It’s your day.
I think JHud was correct not to include the details of her feelings following the murders of her mother, brother and nephew. It is very personal and must still be incredibly painful. I enjoyed the book very much and I enjoyed her sense of humour, I do remember laughing out loud a few times. I quite liked the anecdote about her throwing some nachos out of a car window when she was pregnant because the order was wrong! Jennifer didn’t mention her wedding because she isn’t married yet. I think the book could have been fleshed out a bit, especially regarding her meeting David Otunga and a bit more about their life together. However, I think there is still enough material for her legions of fans and it is a good read.
Meh, its alright but it could have been better. Having not known anything about her life before reading the book, except that she had won some awards, I didn’t even know there had been a family tragedy until I read the words “since my family’s tragedy”. I had to flip back and re-read several pages to see if I had missed something. Then, because it literally is not mentioned until those words, I had to google “j-hud family tragedy” to find out what was up. I mean, that’s fine if you don’t want to talk about it, but at least say something like “Although I won’t be discussing it in this book, a tragedy befell my family and took the life of several family members” – BEFORE mentioning the word “tragedy”. Would that have been so difficult? 
The 50 page WW advertorial was a bit much. I felt like it needed the footer “This is an advertisement”. And it was strange how she kept writing “I can eat whatever I want”, and then she would write something like “I don’t eat fried foods”. Umm…whaaa? Anyway, its an ok book but I don’t feel like she connects to readers all that well. If this book makes the New York Times bestsellers list, it will be because everyone has now seen her on American Idol, Dreamgirls, and WW ads – and not because it is a well-written book.
I think Jennifer Hudson was right on the mark. Like her are not she is one of the most authentic artist in the business. I say she did a super job with her new book. Jhud clearly is incontrol of her career. She is not about to sell out for the nay sayers. Jennifer Hudson is doing it her way period. Yes, she is from the southside of the windy city. However, she is no dummy.  No Jhud did not miss anything all you haters did. People must forgot Jennifer Hudson graduated with honors!!!!! All her talents, gifts, and honors speaks for itself.
Uhmm wtf?  She was right certain things are off limots, this was a book about weight loss, not her family murders or wedding. If you want to hear about that watch her behind the music episode. She doesn’t owe it to either of you or anyone else for that mattet to discusd such a personal thing.  I’m glad she’s not using her family to sell a book, you geniuses should be ashamed.
I read the book and was also surprised that nothing was said about her parents death and her wedding. It was a great read though. But I did feel like I was reading a commercial when she started talking about weight watchers: a little too heavy. I am still a great JHud fan.

Juicing, a verb that not only describes the process of making juice but also the act of dieting on it, is the first big food trend of 2012.
Juice bars have had an impressive presence in Los Angeles for a few years. Now many people take it upon themselves to produce homemade creations.
Celebrities preparing their bodies for the red carpets, for instance, diet on fresh-squeezed fruits. And those looking to shed the pounds from holiday season feasts might have heeded advice from best-selling, healthy-living author Kris Carr.
Her mantra: “Make juice, not war.”
As with most trends, USC students are not immune. You probably have heard the term juicing being thrown around Los Angeles lately, in reference to everything from fulfilling pre-yoga nourishment to a refreshing post-Las Vegas detox.
But you need not have an excuse to begin juicing. Think of an artisan version of the Juicy Juice you delightedly slurped down as a child. The simple pleasure of freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juice is as old as the institution of brunch. But now, juice is being crafted with a particular eye for quality and creativity.
For juiceheads, juicing machines have replaced the simple handheld citrus reamer as the premier household juicing tool. This allows for the personal production of citrus-y juices as well as juices made from nutrient-rich greens and sugary melons.
There are two major types of mechanical juicers: masticating and centrifugal. Mastication is a process that involves slow-spinning blades that help extract a maximum amount of juice, often through self-churning. The faster method is centrifugal, in which whirring electric blades can juice a fruit or vegetable at rapid speeds, although it’s considered a less-efficient method of juicing.
For home-juicing, carrots, kale, apples and ginger make my personal favorite combination. An off-putting brown color might be the result — but as with mushrooms or cottage cheese, many of the best foods taste better than they look.
The ginger root adds an intriguing depth of flavor: You need only to place a small section in the juicer for a noticeable spiciness. For complementary tartness, add some lemon.
Freshly squeezed tomato juice can make a Bloody Mary infinitely better than a V8 or a store-bought mix. If you didn’t think you liked Bloody Marys, it’s likely because you’ve never had them prepared this way. The juice of fresh-pressed tomatoes retains flavor even with the potent additions of horseradish and Worcestershire sauce, both traditional ingredients for the cocktail.
If you have Popsicle molds, you can fill them with fresh juice for a healthy dessert. Or practice the old-school method: filling little Dixie cups with your fresh elixir of choice and inserting wooden sticks as the juice begins to harden. In this unseasonably warm weather, frozen orange or watermelon juices are a particularly refreshing option.
But for all the tasty and colon-cleansing benefits, juicing can also be a pain.
The produce necessary for juicing can get pricey. That’s why it’s smart to buy in bulk. Fruits and vegetables sold by the bagful, such as apples and carrots, should save you some money.
Juicing fruits and vegetables can also be time-consuming and difficult to clean up, so make juice in large batches.
Purchasing cheap glass bottles at Sur La Table or Target is an attractive and efficient way to store your creations. Their slim shape means they won’t take up too much refrigerator space, and with their tightly sealed caps, these bottles will keep juice fresh for days.
On that note, be sure to refrigerate juice. Doing so will keep it fresh and adding ice only waters down the flavor.
There are no real shortcuts to cleaning up your juicing machine. You only have to brush the filter and empty the spent organic matter once.
Besides, cleanup is a small price to pay for juices rich with the flavor and nutrients of greens, citruses and root vegetables. And it’s an even smaller price to pay when considering this: In the increasingly urban city of Los Angeles, sipping on fresh homemade juice will at least make you feel like you have a garden in a glass.
 
Bernard Leed is a junior majoring in narrative studies. His column “Amuse-Bouche” runs Wednesdays.
Juicing helped me conquer chronic fatigue. I had 5 x 10 oz  fresh vegetable juices as day and took coffee enemas. It was not a fast at all. I followed the less intensive Gerson Therapy plan as much as I could. I never went hungry but after 6 months I had my energy back.

“My mom said I drummed on everything, all the time,” says MuteMath drummer and founding member Darren King.
He laughs as he recalls the details.
“I used forks and stuff like that. Somehow she slept through it all,” King says.

Records
It was an auspicious beginning for King, but one of his biggest breakthroughs as a drummer came in a roundabout way, when he called it quits on another early passion: basketball.
“We had all these basketballs. I was obsessed with it, like every other 11-year-old during the Michael Jordan era,” King says. “I don’t think I’ve ever put so much of myself into something and had so little return. I sucked. Seriously. So I took all these basketballs, let out different amounts of air — which gave them different pitches — and then drummed on them.”
King has come a long way from then. He’s now touring the United States with Grammy-nominated rock band MuteMath, which has been lauded for its bombastic live performances, as well as its latest album Odd Soul.
King dreamed of various careers in his teenage years, including a phase in which his intense passion for Christianity led to ambitions of being the next prophet: “I wanted to raise the dead, you know, and write the sequel to the Bible.”
But it was in April 1997 that King first met future MuteMath frontman Paul Meany, whom King “really admired” from the get-go.
Their first collaboration didn’t go so well — King was fired from Meany’s band Earthsuit, which drove him to drum lessons and a greater focus on his craft.

“It was the toughest thing in my life,” King says. “It felt like the worst kind of failure.”
His brief time with Meany, however, was a relationship that paid off. Earthsuit disbanded in 2003, and King and Meany formed a duo that eventually added guitarist Greg Hill and bassist Roy Mitchell-Cárdenas.
The group has released three full-length albums: its 2006 self-titled album, 2009’s Armistice and its latest, 2011’s Odd Soul, which King notes “was a huge jump.”
“The quality of the writing is just better [on Odd Soul]. Armistice has a few songs I like. I like almost everything on [Odd Soul]. And I think we did a smart thing by producing it ourselves,” King says. “We tried to record like we play live, which is really our calling card.”
The recording of the album didn’t come without difficulty, though: Hill quit the band late in 2010 because of differences with the rest of the band.
“It was very sad for Greg to leave,” King says. He pauses, sighs. “Things were really bad during Armistice. I just thought everything had gotten way better. Gosh.
“Greg deserves so much credit for putting up with Paul and me. I think he just had the exact opposite personality to be working with the two of us. We have a proclivity for over-thinking, redoing things, picking it apart. Greg craved order and structure.”
The lack of Hill’s presence hasn’t just affected the band, but also King personally.
“The most frustrating thing is that I want to talk to him about all this exciting stuff, but I can’t. I can’t talk to him about the band and where we’re going. It’s hard,” King says.
The loss of Hill didn’t derail the band though. He was replaced by guitarist Todd Gummerman, who King says has settled in nicely.
“I can’t believe how quickly Todd’s picked things up. It’s funny: He’s like a cat on the road, just laying in the sun enjoying himself,” King says with a chuckle. “I also love touring. Your life gets put on hold, and you don’t get to develop certain relationships, but you get to wake up in a new city all the time. And this time I get to bring my wife with me.”
The tour, which makes a stop at Club Nokia on Feb. 2, will feature not only the band’s music but also spectacular visuals in the form of state-of-the-art, 3-D projection. It’s a technique King refers to as “video-matting,” which in this case will be used to project video graphics on the venue’s entire structure, not just a screen.
“I’ve been creating the content for the project. It’s going to be sick,” King says, noticeably excited.
But tours inevitably end, and King and MuteMath will be faced with a new slew of challenges, including staying afloat in a sea of competing bands and short attention spans.
According to King, the band will be heading back into the studio later this year, tasked with creating more acclaimed music and keeping audience interest high.
King tries not to worry about that, though. All the band can do, he says, is be true to itself.
“In terms of being ‘relevant’ … I don’t think we are that relevant, to be honest, but we just want to be genuine with our music. What’s good music? I can’t define it. But I justify it as ‘I love something … so that makes it good,’” King says. “I didn’t used to think that. Now, I do.”

To protect the rights of the unborn, vote pro-life.
I am writing this letter in response to Thursday’s letter to the editor praising the Roe v. Wade decision and encouraging USC students to “talk sex.” I know my views are not going to be received well, but someone needs to speak out in defense of the other side of the issue.
The baby’s heart can begin to beat as early as eighteen days after conception. The unborn are not clumps of cells; they are humans. (I am not anti-science, as the author seems to assume of anyone who is opposed to abortion and birth control. I believe in evolution and global warming, and I support adult stem-cell research.) Some people seem to think that the unborn are human, but not persons deserving of rights. Who are we, though, to draw the line arbitrarily somewhere along the continuum of human life?
The idea that individuals or governments can decide which humans are persons and which are not is chilling. Historically, this idea has resulted in slavery and the Holocaust. I will be voting only for pro-life politicians this election season; advocating the right to life is not an extreme position to take. Likewise, supporting laws that protect unborn children is not about big government. It is simply about giving all humans the ﬁrst and most basic of our unalienable rights: life.
Never having been in the situation of a crisis pregnancy, I can only imagine how difficult it must be.
Is it hard to carry a baby to term while being a student at USC? I am sure it is. But doing the right thing has never been easy. There are pregnancy help centers in Los Angeles that are ready and waiting to help women in need. Adoption is always an option; there are thousands of couples and families on waiting lists who would love to adopt a child. And yes, there are even couples wishing to adopt special needs children.
I believe in a woman’s right to choose a lot of things. But choosing to kill a baby goes too far. I do not support anyone’s right to kill another human being, no matter how little that human may be.
Vote pro-life in 2012.
 
Lisa Ebiner Gavit
Los Angeles County Coordinator, Rick Santorum for President 
Wow! It’s great that people are recognizing the truth that the unborn babies are human persons! I am pro-life and I am going to vote for Rick Santorum!!!!!
Vote for Life, Vote Rick Santorum for POTUS 2012!!
Life begins at conception! Government is supposed to protect the right to life for every innocent American, including those still in the womb. Men who are convicted of rape cannot be put to death because the Supreme Court says that would be “cruel and unusual” punishment. Why then is it okay to kill the baby who did nothing wrong? It’s a baby, not a choice.
I’m voting Pro-life: Rick Santorum 2012! He’s the only candidate that is 100% Pro-life!
Very good Lisa! Someone has to protect the rights of the defenseless minority from the tyranny of the majority.
So why is the government allowed to decided what lives are important through war?
I don’t understand your response Matt.  Lisa’s well-written opinion obviously reveals her exact reasons for disagreeing with abortion.  She believes that a fetus is a person, and that it shouldn’t be legal to kill a person.  As Rachel acknowledges below, if someone believes that a fetus is human, it is completely understandable and rational to be staunchly pro-life. 
You might have a valid point, but your vague question seems instead to be an attempt to arbitrarily discredit Lisa’s opinion by bringing up something completely irrelevant to the pro-life/pro-choice debate.
I’m pro-choice and definitely not going to vote for any pro-life candidates this election season, but I wanted to say that I can see where you’re coming from, and if I honestly believed that fetuses were human as you genuinely do, then I would be pro-life and horrified at all this legalized murder too. So — good editorial, I guess. You didn’t change my mind, but I do respect your opinion.
Rachel, in your mind, when does a fetus become a human?
Upon birth, although I do think it is a bit of a continuum and I would probably question a later-term abortion.
“I believe in evolution and global warming, and I support adult stem-cell research.” 
You obviously don’t care about those issues that much if you support Santorum. Why would you base your entire political life off of one wedge issue? Extremism isolates us from each other and silences dialogue. If you only vote based on one issue, you are misusing your civic duty and it is no surprise that Santorum’s campaign is foundering.
Dan, of course there are other issues to look at, but there is one dominant issue at hand, when 3,500 human lives are being killed and sancted by law. This is like saying in the 1800’s people were too focused on slavery, even though there were other issues, and in the 1940’s people were too focused on the nazis even though there were other issues at hand.

Turmoil is growing between the California state legislature and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement over immigration laws.
ICE’s Secure Communities program requires local law enforcement to send detainees’ fingerprints to immigration authorities and to hold them on behalf of ICE if they are identified as candidates for deportation.
The state legislature objects; it is close to passing a law instructing local law enforcement to disregard some instructions to detain prisoners longer (the details are not yet finalized). Under this law, California counties would be able to rejoin the program on a voluntary basis.
Angela Choi | Daily Trojan
The opposition has been met with an uproar from ICE authorities, which have called these measures violations of federal law.
An international campus like USC should address the topic of immigration. More important, however, is the need to respect peoples’ rights.
Though stances on immigration vary throughout the USC community, the validity of this program can’t be a part of that discussion until we address the violation of human rights, as well as the harm to law enforcement and the community.
The law puts people who have been convicted of nothing worse than low-level crimes in danger of being detained beyond the lawful time — or, even worse, of being deported on the suspicion of a more serious offense.
To subject all detainees, without exception, to an inter-departmental background check makes mistakes unavoidable.
In defense of the Secure Communities program, ICE spokeswoman Nicole Navas issued the following statement: “Even though some aliens may be arrested on minor criminal charges, they may also have more serious criminal backgrounds which disguise their true danger to society.”
When the United States started putting Japanese-Americans in internment camps after the attack on Pearl Harbor because of their Japanese heritage, the reasoning was of a similar line. It essentially says we should be allowed to impugn upon innocent people’s rights in case we find out they are guilty.
It is possible some of these people are guilty of graver offenses, but in this country, people are considered innocent until proven guilty. Holding them in custody “just in case” goes against their rights. This issue is greater than immigration.
ICE’s Secure Communities program puts unwarranted strain on local law enforcement.
Asking local officers to forgo their own responsibilities to take part in the immigration struggle hurts their ability to protect their communities — their primary objective. Time spent dealing with undocumented immigrants could be spent keeping Los Angeles safe.
These issues have caused the state legislature to defy ICE. Led by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, the legislation is called the Trust Act. It has already been passed by the Assembly and the Senate Public Safety Committee.
To support human rights and make sure law enforcement has the means to keep us safe, don’t stay silent. Write a letter to a California legislator.

Nevada–has the same problems as the Sanctuary state of California, Arizona that has been overwhelmed by poverty from the large influx of illegal aliens. The only difference is the legislators in California and Nevada disregard their resident’s pleas for help and still pander to foreign nationals. That’s why all Governors, Mayors and every official, who supports this growing plague must be removed from office. Every person who wants the 2006 real double fence, The Legal Workforce bill, recognized as E-Verify and The Citizenship Birthright Act amended should join the Tea Party or other strong advocates on this matter. Illegal immigration costs California $10.5 Billion annually, with Nevada annual fiscal burden of immigration to be approximately $630 million as according to the Heritage Foundation. Powerful interests in the state garner the benefits, while the average legal California family gets handed over nearly $1,200 annually. So what’s the real cost in Alabama or any of the other 47 States?
Fortunately it just goes to show that legal immigrants especially generations of Hispanics are against illegal immigration and are for enforcement, by their positive vote in Florida for Mitt Romney. They too are suffering from the indignation as being blamed from the 500.000 that illegally enters America. Of course Nevada has its own set of problems, for it also has been flooded with illegal aliens. They have infiltrated the service industry, entertainment and worse hit of all—construction. Taking jobs for bonefide US citizens and legal residents, who were rejected as Contractors and sub-contractors could make more money from discount labor. They didn’t have to offer benefits to foreigners, who swarmed Nevada during the height of the real estate boom. Other then Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum, Gingrich and Paul cannot be trusted with their promises to the foreign nationals, as they are against the fence and are calling with a Path to legality–that is not what the general public want? 
In one of the latest polls Maine voters were asked about their views on legal immigration. A substantial majority of respondents, 59 percent, judge that overall levels “are too high and should be reduced,” while only 6 percent believe immigration should be increased.
Among the key findings of the poll:
•	65% believe that illegal immigration negatively affects Maine.
•	78% oppose in-state tuition subsidies and/or admission of illegal aliens to public universities.
•	65% support state involvement in immigration enforcement, similar to policies enacted in Arizona and other states.
•	43% believe illegal immigrants take jobs from American workers, while only 32% believe they fill jobs Americans will not do.
•	59% support reducing overall immigration to the U.S., while only 6% support increasing immigration.
In California and Nevada millions of jobs that should be in the hands of citizens, instead have been stolen by people from across the globe.  Huge amounts of expenditures have been growing, because of careless use of Taxpayers’ dollars by politicians. Specific to Border States is the spiraling high cost of millions of illegal aliens pouring in, demanding equal rights to US citizens. 22 million Americans are out of work and President Obama has passed executive orders, so hundreds of thousands of unlawful migrants and immigrants without a criminal record can stay here. Farmers want the cheap labor, as they remain exempt for paying their medical issues or even their children’s schooling. Democrats will look the other way in all elections, as illegal aliens are voting and will again through 2012.  These are two unfunded mandates that the US government pays nothing towards, and  state compliance laws is mandatory and forced upon Americans by the courts. The low estimate for paying for all these unfunded mandates annually is $113 billion dollars.  Except to stay here, you have to have food, medical care and for their children and education. Staying here it means you have to commit a felony, as to find employment you must possess a legitimate Social Security number, unless the employer is committing an illegal act themselves. Therefore using some persons SSN is a victim of identity theft and that is a –FELONY.  
As a patriotic American people we cannot afford to stop pursuing full, mandated “THE LEGAL WORKFORCE ACT” or mandated nationwide E-Verify. Without it our countries businesses will be overrun by illegal workers in every sector of industry. The circumstances have now become so critical, owing to the millions of jobless citizens, legal residents that our government needs to insist full operation of the computer based application. E-Verify is a valuable tool that has expanded to a growing number of honest businesses that have participated in the removal of foreign nationals. 
There is toxicity amongst the Democrats and Republicans, who have an irrational view and are eager to destroy any immigration enforcement at our undermanned border or tourists who overstay deliberately. As it stands a path to citizenship, espoused as Immigration reform wants to legalize all those already here. Can anybody imagine if foreign countries supported their citizens that America would not be suffering the problems of foreign workers and their families crowding the emergency rooms of major cities, educating their children and feeding off the limited benefits afforded the US population? E-verify must not be undermined or thrown into the waste pit of good immigration bills?
Phone 202-224-3121 is the Washington center switchboard, to express your infuriated feelings and anguish at Senators and Representatives of both parties. Obamacare for all Americans will be inundated with illegal immigrants and will just drive more of them into our nation. They keep declaring no health care treatment for any illegal people, but unl ess the mandated federal bill such as E-Verify is operational, then how can we distinguish from the legal population and those who have broken immigration laws? Under such a Congressional law, the long trek home will begin if illegal workers cannot find a job. Those business owners who fail to comply could end up in prison or fined millions of dollars?  All immigration bills need to be passed before Obama tries to pass another failed amnesty, as in 1986.

Christian, so because they weren’t “lucky” enough to be born here, that gives them the right to barge in and ignore our laws?
I’m glad that the DT is writing about immigration reform. We’ve tried to get published but were snubbed by the end of our exchange. But I digress…
Secure communities is an ill conceived program that places unnecessary strain on local law enforcement. There should be no random documentation check but, if an individual commits a crime (not a minor infraction), a background check would not be frowned upon.
In regards to immigration reform, concerning ICE procedures, there is something called the Morton Memo that addresses priorities in deportation processes and that, although clearly explicit, ICE agents still do not follow!  The implementation of the outlined guidelines would make a positive impact.
As for the comment on building a wall/fence with adequate security…seriously?  That is the most archaic solution that only benefits the contractors that will build that useless barrier! It’s simply laughable!

Sí se puede!  Fight On!
It’s called a background check. Everyone who is arrested has one ran on them to see if they have any priors. It’s no different for an illegal who has broken another law in our country. There is no compromise of human rights or safety. And I will write a letter to the legislator to ask them to pass a bill to build a wall that separates California and Mexico. A real wall that is properly guarded.
How bout no Joshua. 
All these programs like Secure Communities and 287g were created for the effort towards the “War on Terrorism” and ICE mentions that they also want to catch those who are undocumented (even though those hateful terrorists on 9/11 had lawful visas & weren’t undocumented). Anyways, these programs promote racial profiling and the police’s #1 job should be PROTECTING us from immediate crime and serving our community, not “Protect and Serve all those who have a 9-digit number”. 
Furthermore, in previous times before Secure Communities, people’s fingerprints were sent to the Department of Justice to see if they had any felonies or other criminal convictions and then if your fingerprints came back with no match, it meant you were clean, NOT undocumented. However, with these new programs, they send your fingerprints to DOJ and ICE just because you’re being detained or arrested, not even convicted of the accused crime. Many instances where mothers, fathers, family, close neighbors were driving to work and got pulled over & then deported. However, when an American citizen/documented resident gets pulled over, its just a $90 dollar fix-it ticket. That is injustice and it dehumanizes immigrants by denying their rights to pursue opportunities in a nation (the U.S.) that most likely has economically marginalized the circumstances in many countries of emigration (fleeing native lands). The compromise of public safety and human rights revolves around that when you’re fearful of going outside to an event where police will be or afraid that by reporting a threatening crime (domestic violence, witness to a murder/violent crime), you will be deported is in fact, – terrorism. Because in the so-called “land of the free and of the brave”, why must someone who is a minority (this case undocumented residents) have to be watching their backs? 
I am disappointed that you believe a wall on the border will solve this problem, further militarizing the border will only contribute to the negative stigma that the U.S. loves outsourcing jobs, disproportionately affect foreign nations economies, and thinks it could play “fort in the living room” with a wall. Ron Paul, Rick Perry, and many border security experts KNOW that a border wall is just either an ignorant answer or a disillusioned solution. Lastly, its sad that instead of seeing the 11 undocumented immigrants as potential tax-paying (some are already, look up “ITIN”), instead of seeing them as more potential additions to our national melting pot, you perceive them as some sort of threat because they might not have been as lucky as you to have been born in this country.

Leslie Feist has released a music video for “The Bad in Each Other,” the album opener for her recent album, Metals. The video was directed by Martin de Thurah and filmed in Mexico.
Feist has described the video as “a symphony of Betweens,” about “all the quiet internal battles that guide our actions, all the hopes and struggles we suppress or let carry us away.”

The film braids several vignettes into one narrative lace which the music traces. While the original song describes one relationship shutting down, this supplemental picture-show barrages us with varied snatches of muddling relations.
The characters here are lonely and in pain. A boy befriends a chicken and watches his new friend roast. A girl hides in the shadows to watch her parents argue. Two guys compete to dance with the same girl and then the winner looks apologetically at his buddy from across the dance-floor. A widower nuzzles his elderly dog as a vet euthanizes the animal.
With these images together, Feist is illuminating one of the most forceful thematic undercurrents of Metals, the tragedy of all relationships—the fact of inevitable separation. Put another way: To be happy we need love, but we get sad when our loves leave us. By necessity, humanity offers itself up to heartbreak. If the storylines here are little battles, the war is a species-wide struggle for connection.

Last week, I talked about framing and the rule of thirds. This week, we’ll take a closer look at composition, and in particular, depth of field.
Depth of field is a term that is thrown around a lot in video and film.  It may sound complex, but depth of field simply refers to the part of the image that is in focus.  A deep depth of field will allow both the foreground and background of a shot to be in focus (normal vision).  This depth of field is often used for capturing objects in the distance, and for a more documentary-style film.
A shallow or narrow depth of field will cause only the foreground to be in focus.  Thus, the subject in the foreground will be in focus, while objects behind the suspect will be blurry.  A narrow depth of field is often used for portraits and close-ups.
Depth of field varies by the focal length of a lens, usually measured in millimeters.  A 50mm lens is standard for cinema and video and mimics the human eye’s focal length.  The shorter the focal length, the deeper the depth of field—thus, a 16mm would be an ultra-wide lens, and a 200mm lens have an extremely shallow depth of field.  One can often see a large, 200mm lens being used at a sporting event—they’re the huge lenses that work well for eliminating unnecessary objects from the shot.
However, a degree of distortion is created when using extremely long or shot lenses.  A wide-angle lens may stretch out images, while a telephoto lens (200mm) will compress an image.  Each lens can be used to tell a different story—the possibilities are endless.
