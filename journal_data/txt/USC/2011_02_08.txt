Students who protested in front of Tommy Trojan yesterday chanted “Hey, Hey! Ho, Ho! Mubarak has got to go!” Tim McNally, a senior majoring in international relations, said he was rallying for his friends in Cairo. “I am here in support of the Egyptian people and their efforts to overthrow tyranny and realize freedom,” McNally said.

Mechanical problems at an off-campus Information Technology Services data center Tuesday morning caused disruptions to Internet, Blackboard, phone and USC e-mail access across campus.
“At approximately 7:45 a.m., an electrical problem in the university’s data center triggered the center’s fire suppression system and shut down the supply of power to multiple IT systems,” said ITS Director of Communications and Marketing Kevin Durkin. “The fire department was immediately notified and the building was evacuated.”
Those who called ITS asking for assistance heard a recording acknowledging that there had been issues Tuesday morning.
“This is Tuesday, Feb. 8 at 9:55 a.m. We are experiencing network outages and major system failures, including e-mail and website features. We have no ETA at this time,” the recording said.
Most issues seemed to be resolved by 1 p.m., though some students still reported problems getting online.
“As of this moment, e-mail, phone, Blackboard and most website service, including the main USC website services, have been restored and users can now connect to the wired network,” Durkin said at 1:15 p.m. “Wireless connectivity is available but some users may experience a delay or time-out.”
Michelle Lim, a sophomore majoring in archaeology and narrative studies, said not having Internet access inconvenienced her in a geology class at 12:30 p.m., but the class was able to get online 15 minutes later.
“I was in class and we had to download a data file from Blackboard, but it was down,” Lim said. “We normally download the file at the beginning of class, but we started late today.”
Some students said they had trouble turning in homework.
“Only three of the 11 students in my Italian class were able to do their homework,” said Chris Benassi, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences.
ITS has been working to improve wireless coverage on campus, although the USC network sometimes varies in strength.
“I came to campus to get work done this morning, but I couldn’t because the Internet was down,” said Michelle Ragsdale, a senior majoring in linguistics and psychology. “It was annoying, but it wasn’t the end of the world. I knew the Internet would be back eventually.”

Lobbying for more vegetarian and kosher dining options, increasing the number of recycling bins in university housing and advocating for an updated web registration system are just some of the issues on Undergraduate Student Government presidential candidate Alex Fadil and vice presidential candidate Rohan Mehra’s platform.
Go green · Alex Fadil (right) and Rohan Mehra hope to create incentives to entice campus organizations to be more environmentally conscious. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
A junior majoring in international relations (global business), Fadil is currently the executive vice president of judicial affairs for the Interfraternity Council and a member of Reverse Osmosis A Capella. Mehra, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering, is currently the president of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and a member of the Golden Key International Honour Society. Together, they re-founded Pi Kappa Phi at USC in 2009.
Mehra said he thinks the pair’s involvement in a variety of organizations gives them an advantage.
“Alex and I are a very strong team because we have a lot of experience working together,” he said. “We’ve both been under the same pressures together, and we know how to handle huge situations and work as a team to get things done.”
Fadil and Mehra said uniting the different communities at USC is key to implementing change.
“It’s really all about uniting the school,” Fadil said. “A lot of people don’t have the best notion of what USG does and what resources are available. We want to unite the schools, fraternities and the commuters.”
Neither Fadil nor Mehra have been part of USG, but they don’t think their lack of experience will be an issue in their campaign.
“USG is very internal,” Fadil said. “We want to add an outsider’s perspective and bring student voices to USG.”
They said sustainability is one of the big items on their platform. Not only do Fadil and Mehra hope to increase the number of recycling bins on campus, but they also hope to create incentives for students to be more sustainable, such as intra-organization competitions.
“If students are talking about green things in everyday conversation, that will move our student body to consider that as well,” Mehra said.
If elected, Fadil and Mehra hope to improve communication between the student body and student government to increase transparency and to encourage more people to get involved with USG. One way they plan to expand involvement is by sending out short e-mails that highlight USG activities.
“We want to send out bi-weekly or monthly school-wide e-mails with what USG is doing, what USG plans on doing and how you can get involved,” Mehra said.
The most important thing to Fadil, however, is making students happy and serving as the middleman between students and the administration.
“I want to be the voice of this student body and represent them for all things USC, and I want to be the best person I can be for the rest of the school,” Fadil said. “We want to know what to do to get the most out of the student voice and whether or not we’re understanding that voice to the best of our capability.”
Mehra said the pair hopes to make an impact on the school through student government and to push for issues students care about by becoming the leaders of the school.
“We both love our school, and we really enjoy our time here,” Mehra said. “Maybe it’s about time for us to make as big a positive footprint so that everyone else will have a good time and love the school as much as we have.”
The campaign process isn’t a burden to either Fadil or Mehra. Rather, the duo said they find it enjoyable and fun.
“It’s not an overwhelming amount of work,” Fadil said. “When I feel passionate about something, I go for it all the way.”

The question is how responsive have the current USG members been to the student body and what have they actually accomplished.  If  you are satisfied with their past actions, no problem, vote for them.  If the majority of
what you have received is lip service, new blood and passion is a viable alternative.
Go Alex! Voting for you
The presdient and vice president candidate don’t have USG experience but they are arrogant enough to claim USG is internal. To an outsider, it would be internal. The President’s position is not something you just run for without learning about USG. Other candidates have paid their dues. I don’t see their experience on the issues or much experience at all. For candidates with a Green initiative, it is surprising that nothing on their sustainability is highlighted in the article. Where is their history of involvement with a Climate Change organization if they are passionate about moving the university towards sustainability. The environment is a real issue and not to be used for personal gain and convenience.
Neither the presdient or vice president candidate has USG experience yet they show such arrogance to claim USG is internal. To an outsider, it would be internal.

For candidates with a Green initiative, it is surprising that nothing on their sustainability is highlighted in the article. The Golden Key is not a very meaningful honors society, and I would rather see their involvement with a Climate Change organization if they are passionate about moving the university towards sustainability. Otherwise, it is a campagn ploy. The environment is a real issue and not to be used for personal gain or convenience.
I take that back…I didn’t seem to read the whole article. They look like they’re well versed on their campaign issues and want to bring legitimate change to USC.
who are these guys? they have no usg experience. they will absolutely not be getting my vote.

The Undergraduate Student Government presidential candidates discussed several issues during Tuesday night’s presidential debate, but varied most in their views about how USG should change the way it represents and connects to students.
Be heard · Alex Fadil (left), Eric Burse and Monish Tyagi (right) debated important campus issues for more than an hour and a half last night. - Emily Tat | Daily Trojan 
The debate, held in the forum room of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, was moderated by Paresh Dave, deputy editor of Neon Tommy, Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, and Grace Wong, news editor of the Daily Trojan.
This year, the debate allowed vice presidential candidates to pose questions to the presidential candidates, and the presidential candidates got to pose questions to their opponents.
“The candidates know the most important issues for the elections so they can ask the deeper and more relevant questions to each other,” said Barb Solish, co-director of USG Elections and Recruitment.
Presidential candidate Monish Tyagi, who currently serves as USG director of campus affairs, said he believes USG should serve as an advocacy group to the administration.
“My job is to be the primary advocate for students,” Tyagi said. “If you look at all the student organizations on campus as spokes of a wheel, we want USG to be the center of that wheel.”
Presidential candidate Eric Burse, current president of the Black Student Assembly, said he feels USG should focus on ensuring collaboration between organizations, especially in regards to publicity of events.
“Oftentimes, we suffer from students who don’t care about what USG does or what Program Board does, and we need to change that culture,” Burse said.
Presidential candidate Alex Fadil, the executive vice president of judicial affairs of the Interfraternity Council, said he believes USG should serve as the information center for students on campus to help student organizations work together.
“The issue is communication and publicizing events properly,” he said. “We have 600 organizations on campus. We want to advocate for them and increase participation within USC.”
The candidates also took different stances on key issues such as sustainability, dining dollars and USG discretionary funds.
Fadil said he feels sustainability should be addressed by increasing hybrid car usage, and that USG should push for dining dollars to be accepted at places like The Lab.
Burse said USG should work to add recycling bins in all dorm rooms and work with nearby businesses to accept discretionary funds.
Tyagi said he believes USG should work with the Office of Sustainability and other on-campus experts to improve sustainability. He also wants to talk to businesses in Tuscany and Gateway that already have closer relationships with USG about accepting discretionary dollars.
For some students, the relationship between the candidates on each presidential ticket is important in the upcoming election.
“It is more than just the platforms,” said Dylan Steinman, a junior majoring in economics political science. “The friendship and relationship between vice president and president is super important.”
Students were impressed overall by the preparedness of the candidates and the ideas they put forward.
“The candidates did a really good job, and they were well prepared with their answers,” said Makhala Greene-Robinson, a sophomore majoring in political science.
David Lowenstein contributed  to this report.

all trash at USC is recycled so recycle bins serve no purpose but to train people to recycle.
Incorrect.  Atlas only gets about 50% of the recyclables out of our trash.  Also, they have very specific rules for what trash is able to be sifted for recyclables that eliminates a lot of it.  Increased numbers of recycling bins, especially CLEARLY MARKED bins (glass, paper, plastic), can help USC to use our resources more effectively.

The USC women’s tennis team kicked off one of its busiest weeks of play Wednesday, sweeping the San Diego State Aztecs at Marks Stadium, 7-0.
The No. 17 Women of Troy rebounded from a loss during the second round of the ITA Kick-Off tournament against No. 8 Michigan, but it did not stop them from sweeping away the competition.
Starting off strong · Senior Maria Sanchez helped lead the Women of Troy to victory in the first of three matches played at home this week. - Daily Trojan file photo
USC started the dual meet strongly and won the doubles point.
The duo of sophomore Danielle Lao and senior Lyndsay Kinstler stepped up, defeating their Aztec opponents 8-2.
Playing at the No. 3 spot, Kinstler and Lao were the first to finish their doubles match and helped set the precedent for the rest of the meet.
Senior Maria Sanchez and freshman Kaitlyn Christian, ranked No. 80, also beat their opponents 8-6.
The No. 11 doubles pair of junior Alison Ramos and sophomore Valeria Pulido lost their match, but that was the only defeat the Trojans saw in the entire competition.
Ramos and Pulido fought hard against the doubles team of Alicia Aguilar and Julia Wais of San Diego State, but came up short 6-8.
“We didn’t play that well in doubles, except for No. 3 [Kinstler and Lao], but we knew we didn’t play our best,” Ramos said. “[Coach] Richard definitely pushed us and said, ‘You know what, stay positive and compete hard,’ and that’s exactly what we did.”
The team certainly did bounce back after doubles play to go on and sweep the singles competition.
Near the end of singles play, Sanchez, ranked No. 3 nationally, and her opponent were the last pair standing.
With the score 5-0 in favor of USC, Sanchez closed out the match, defeating the Aztecs’ Julia Trunk 6-3, 6-3.
“[SDSU] played very well in doubles and gave us far more trouble than I think we were ready for,” said USC coach Richard Gallien. “We did win the doubles point, but it wasn’t our best showing of the season.”
Sanchez saw the win against SDSU as a positive sign for the team, which has some tough competitions coming up this week.
“[This victory] will give us some momentum heading into Thursday, especially after coming off a loss against Michigan,” Sanchez said. “It gives us a little bit of confidence. I don’t think anyone felt great today but it will only get better as the week goes on.”
With one win under its belt this week, USC now faces the task of competing against two tough opponents.
The Women of Troy will face the University of South Florida Thursday at 1:30 p.m. at Marks Stadium, and No. 22 Texas on Sunday at noon.
Gallien is optimistic about Thursday, not only about how play will unfold, but also about fan turnout.
“Overall I think the girls are doing great,” he said. “I expect a very good performance Thursday against a tough team.”

As Valentine’s Day approaches, I thought I would get an early start on my day-long celebration of commercialism and over-the-top flattery.
This year, though, times were tough, so instead of going to the grocery store and spending my dimes on a glittery Hallmark card, I decided there was no better way to honor those who deserve a little extra love than with a nice spotlight.
There are a lot of deserving candidates who could use some care and compassion right now.
And no, I’m not talking about you, Everson Griffen and Mitch Mustain.
No, this year, the roses and chocolates go to an especially unsavory cast of characters, who, in the words of Bon Jovi, “just want to be loved.”
This toast is for college basketball’s cavalcade of quitters.
(Cue the music to Bud Light’s “Real American Heroes.”)
Today, I salute you, Mr. My-Minutes-Have-Been-Cut-So-It’s-Time-To-Quit-And-Transfer guy.
That’s right, Larry Drew II of UNC, Bryce Jones of USC, Devoe Joseph of Minnesota and Gary Franklin of Cal — this is for you.
PTPer used to stand for Primetime Player.
But we all know you love yourself and your minutes more than you love the team, so the acronym has been fittingly changed to playing time pouter.
When the going got tough in your relationship with coaches, who, by the way, have accumulated three national championships and almost 2,000 wins among them, you ignorantly got up and bailed.
I get it.
As the big man on campus, you expect to be treated well from day one.
It’s nice to be coddled and fawned over by the local media and even Division I coaches around the state when you’re a recruit, but once you enter college, it’s time to grow up.
Regardless of what you were told during recruiting trips, a starting spot is not earned based on past merit or scrapbooks full of amateur accomplishments.
When you average 25 minutes a game as a starting guard at Cal, you can’t shoot less than 30 percent from the floor through 13 games, Mr. Franklin. Especially when you are trying to share the backcourt with 2010 California Gatorade Player of the Year Allen Crabbe, who, during that same 13-game span, averaged more points per game on higher field-goal and three-point percentages.
As for you, Mr. Jones, whether it was an alleged fight in practice or the emergence of junior guard Jio Fontan that did you in, maturity is shown by what you do when the odds are stacked against you.
Even with all the athleticism in the world, there are no excuses for the disappearing acts that began before the Fordham transfer was cleared to play. Not to mention a disastrous assist-to-turnover ratio that fell below one.
It’s sad when this saga of missteps makes a Christina Aguilera anthem blunder look like a tale of character, but in the case of Mr. Joseph and his on-again, off-again battles with Minnesota’s coach Tubby Smith, there is nothing beautiful about this situation no matter what they say.
After being suspended for the team’s first six games, Joseph’s emergence was the only thing more surprising in Minneapolis than an old, domed stadium caving in during a snow storm.
With Joseph’s poise and a knack for being clutch in late-game situations, Gopher fans believed a Big Ten regular season championship could be on the horizon for the first time since 1982.
So much for that.
When the ball dropped to ring in 2011, Mr. Joseph dropped his own proverbial ball when he opened his mouth to teammates about wanting to transfer.
Of course, he no longer is with the team, and they seem to be doing fine without his services, currently sitting at No. 25 in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll.
They say a seasoned point guard in college is like a fine bottle of wine — with age, they are a lot more enjoyable to coach. To be blunt, Drew is no Pinot Noir or Merlot.
He might be a junior and the son of current Atlanta Hawks coach Larry Drew, but the apple falls far from the tree in this basketball family.
Don’t tell Drew II this, but he isn’t exactly in the mold of Roy Williams’ other UNC products, Ty Lawson and Raymond Felton.
In more than 25 minutes per game the last two seasons, Drew II averaged six points and five assists per game, all while shooting less than 30 percent from beyond the three-point arc.
Not to mention, since he was replaced in the starting lineup five games ago by freshman Kendall Marshall, the Tar Heels haven’t lost and are ranked in the top 25.
Here’s to hoping that after his college career concludes, the Encino-native finds a suitor in the NBDL.
So, to you, Mr. My-Minutes-Got-Cut-So-Now-It’s-Time-To-Quit-And-Transfer guy, my hope is that as you sit on your couch of loneliness and despair this Valentine’s Day, you will look deeper than the jelly-filled substance in your chocolate truffles.
My hope is that you learn that to be loved, sometimes you have to show you’re worthy of being loved first.
“For The Love Of The Game” runs Wednesdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Dave at dulberg@usc.edu.
Three of the four guys you mention are from California. Another pair of California guys you also could include are the Wear twins, who abruptly left North Carolina immediately after the season last year to transfer to UCLA.

We’ve seen great sibling athletes before: the Mortons (Johnnie and Chad), the McKeevers (Marlin and Mike), the Boones (Bret and Aaron), the Floreses (Ron and Randy) and the Jensens (Luke and Murphy).
Making their case for a spot on this list are senior Riley and sophomore Maddison McKibbin, two brothers on the undefeated USC men’s volleyball team.
Renee Cohn | Daily Trojan
Hailing from Honolulu, Hawaii, the brothers have seen each other grow and develop in the sport since they first touched a volleyball.
“We’ve come a long way from playing in the backyard,” Riley said. “It’s kind of funny that we’re both playing together again.”
Volleyball doesn’t often get the acclaim of football, baseball or even tennis.
But if it did, the McKibbin brothers would be a superstar duo.
The McKibbins play two different positions — Riley is a setter, Maddison is a hitter.
They don’t look alike, either.
Riley has a mop of dark brown hair reminiscent of John Travolta in Grease, while Maddison sports a cropped blond ‘do that is consummate Wall Street.
Their approaches to the sport are distinct as well.
“Riley comes in just doing his thing, and Maddison wants to know why he’s doing [certain] things,” said USC assistant strength coach Brent Metz.
Still, despite their differences, the brothers add a special dynamic to the court.
“It does bring this cohesiveness,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “Not only are you teammates, but you’re a third of the six guys out there.”
A perfect assist by one McKibbin creates the perfect kill for the other.
“I try to take as much pressure off our hitters, including Maddison — actually sometimes especially Maddison,” Riley said. “I don’t want him to look bad and I want him to play well.”
It’s family instinct.
That’s not to say they aren’t competitive.
“Sometimes he’s hard to play with,” Maddison said. “I’m sure I’d feel the same way that every time he sets me, he kind of cringes and hopes I put it away.”
Four other brother duos have been a part of USC volleyball history. Curt and Kent Caldwell were on the same team in 1972, Bryan and Pat Ivie in 1991, Beau and Omar Rawi in 1999 and J.T. and Marcus Gilmour in 2002.
What makes the McKibbins different is their opportunity to excel together.
USC was 3-7 overall in 1972, Bryan was the much better Ivie and Marcus Gilmour was plagued with a knee injury for most of his college career.
Riley and Maddison seem to resemble the Rawis pair most, except that Beau and Omar Rawi were both hitters.
Instead, the McKibbins share the limelight with their collaborative highlights.
“Volleyball is such a sport where you really have to rely on the other people around you to make plays for you,” said senior opposite hitter Murphy Troy. “When you’re that close to someone like they are, they can count on each other to make plays.”
It’s simply the connection they have.
Both graduated from Punahou High, where Maddison and Riley won six total state championships, two of which they won together in 2006.
Maddison made the Junior Olympics All-Tourney teams three consecutive years, from 2006-2008.
Riley won a gold medal at the AAU Junior National Beach Volleyball Championships in 2007.
Last year alone, Maddison made the 2010 MPSF All-Freshman team and Riley made the MPSF All-Academic.
Maddison called his brother the team’s silent leader.
“I just try to be as supportive as I can,” Riley said.
Riley, however, was anything but silent when praising his younger sibling.
“He’s come a long way,” the senior McKibbin said. “He’s grown up so much, he wasn’t always as confident and aggressive as he is on the court.”
Riley and Maddison aren’t the only McKibbins to leave their mark in USC volleyball history.
The duo’s uncle, Owen, lettered at USC, and their aunt, Claudia, was a part of the Women of Troy’s national championship run in 1980.
“Sharing the court, playing with a sibling is something very few people get to do and it makes the experience all that much better,” Maddison said.
Supportive, competitive and combative, the McKibbin brothers have helped the Trojans to a 6-0 start this season.
Must be that brotherly love.

Dieting isn’t easy. Especially the Raw Food Diet.
As a nice way to start the new year in 2008, I thought it would be a great idea to try ridding myself of all the toxins floating around my body from the previous months.
Photo by Jennifer Schultz
The Master Cleanse with cayenne pepper, maple syrup and lemon juice? Nope. After thinking about the soup diet and the cookie diet, I finally settled on the Raw Food Diet.
For those unfamiliar with the idea, it consists of eating entirely unprocessed foods. No meat, no dairy, no Sun Chips, nothing from a package. The diet should only be  adhered to for short spurts of time, ranging from five to 20 days. As with any diet, always consult a doctor or nutritionist to plan out the steps according to your personal needs.
The Raw Food diet consists of raw fruits, raw vegetables and unroasted, unsalted nuts. In addition, the Raw Food Diet rules prohibit participants from heating food above 118 degrees Fahrenheit, because doing so is said to destroy the enzymes in food that aid in their digestion and absorption.
Prior to starting the Raw Food Diet, I was a vegetarian for six months, and thought five days of raw eating would be easy.
Consider the following eating regime: Breakfast is an orange and a handful of unprocessed trail mix. Lunch is made up of almonds and vegetables. For a snack, you have a banana and almonds. Dinner is beans and vegetables. Seaweed is a midnight snack.
If the restrictive nature of this diet brings to mind the feeding habits of someone with an eating disorder, you’re not far off. When executed properly, though, and not merely as an excuse to lose weight, this diet does have benefits, which, once you get past the third day, can include increased energy, clearer skin and better digestion.
Should you embark on the diet, it is essential that you do so in a safe manner to get good results. Getting enough protein is the most crucial part of any diet. Nuts, legumes, grains and beans are imperative. Yes, your palate might grow bored with the taste of raw cashews, but if you are going to try the diet, you need to do it right.
By the end of the diet, I was practically starving, but I knew that those five days of suffering were worthwhile. I felt remarkably cleansed and reinvigorated.
The promised benefits of this diet are real. I reached my goal of cleansing my body and I became much more aware of all the junk I used to put in it.
You are what you eat. If you don’t eat enough natural food, you really don’t feel good. If you don’t have enough protein, you feel weak. The Raw Food Diet is not easy, and requires serious planning to ensure the food you are eating is enjoyable. Listening to your body is critical, to guarantee that you’re getting enough protein and complex carbs.
The ordeal might seem easy at first, but when a plate of gourmet hors d’œuvres and pan-roasted chicken presents itself and you start to feel your mouth watering, you realize it isn’t so easy after all.
Remember, there is a fine line between utilizing the Raw Food Diet and using it as an excuse not to eat. As long as it is executed with sufficient proteins, and potential dieters brace themselves for its initial agonies, it is effective in teaching you how to bring more fruits, vegetables and nuts into your life.
Ease your way into the diet. Start with vegetarianism, then veganism, and then cut it down to raw food.
Your body will thank you later.

A casual stroll through Los Angeles reveals the city’s culture. Nestled between the fast-food joints that seem to occupy every corner are gyms, nutrition stores and fitness apparel retailers.
The world of health and physical fitness is rife with polarization. And once a person learns there is more to good health than the ty simple cutting of carbs and fats, it is easy to get discouraged.
A brief glance into the Lyon Center’s weight room might scare off newcomers for fear of being doused in a collective sweat. But with proper preparation, making trips to the gym and creating a regular weight lifting routine is not difficult.
Any successful workout is based on productivity and reaching an end goal. Whether your aim is to garner compliments during beach season or hone bar-brawling skills, training without a definitive goal is like painting blind-folded.
Try to be as specific as possible with your plan. “Getting stronger” is too general. How much stronger? A better goal would be to bench press a specific amount of pounds within three months. Though goals should be realistic, don’t worry about setting a high standard. Even if the goal isn’t reached on time, the fruits of your labor will show.
With society’s standards of beauty, one of the main reasons to engage in strength training is to “beef up,” to build muscle and look good. Fair enough, but consider one caveat: Big muscles are not always synonymous with strong muscles. That is the basic difference between “weightlifters” and “bodybuilders.” Possessing Rocky’s chest is not the same as possessing the strength of his hook.
On the other hand, if your goal is to burn fat, strength training plus cardio beats cardio alone.
Keep in mind that muscle is denser than fat. Initially, muscle growth might cause a minor weight gain. But don’t worry. Fat will diminish with time and be replaced by muscle. Ultimately, this means less mass and a leaner, more toned appearance.
After setting a target, it is best to assemble a workout plan exercise by exercise. Look for one that targets specific body parts. Workouts should include a range of exercises, along with the number of sets and repetitions.
Any lifting exercise is divided into sets and sets are divided into reps. Two sets of five bench press reps is a total of 10 full presses. In a general sense, exercises that tone muscles include more repetitions, while strength-increasing workouts involve more weight and fewer reps.
Initially, a workout might be full of unfamiliar exercises. The easiest way to learn is to just do them. Workouts don’t need to be complicated to be effective, so if one is full of asterisks and conditional statements, it might be better to avoid it altogether.
That being said, there are a few tips to keep in mind at the gym. Stretch before and after workouts to prevent injuries and soreness, and perform exercises with good form. Lifting dumbbells for a bicep routine should actually employ the bicep, not momentum.
Don’t expect to reach perfection on the first day, but try to be aware of proper form early on. There’s nothing worse than realizing only a minor adjustment could have yielded some truly sculpted pecs.
Similarly, go for the full range of motion. More of the muscle is used this way.
Be aware of the rest periods. Depending on goals of strength or mass, consider longer or shorter rest periods between sets. Sixty to 90 seconds is generally considered the average time per period.
Finding workout buddies can also be a great way to enhance your gym visits. A good spotter is invaluable as long as it doesn’t cause serious sidetracking.
There are many things to consider when working out, but like driving, no one follows all of the rules perfectly.
The most important thing is to get the base essence out of weight lifting.
In workouts, that means being physically productive. Don’t be surprised by stiff muscles after the first few sessions. And wait at least six weeks before expecting to see Tommy Trojan’s body in the mirror.

When it comes to Valentine’s Day songs, hip-hop is probably the last genre lovebirds look to for romantic music.
For years, hip-hop has been branded as a male-dominated, chauvinistic music style.
Those accusations are largely accurate, as rappers have been calling women names and rapping about mistreating them for more than 20 years. Dr. Dre has “Bitches Ain’t S**t,” Ja Rule has “Bitch Betta Have My Money;” and the list goes on and on.
At Too $hort’s 40th birthday concert at The Key Club in West Hollywood last year, he celebrated by repeatedly slapping girls’ backsides and shouting his favorite word (again, “bitch”).
What some critics don’t realize, however, is hip-hop does have its softer, more sensitive side.
Some of the same hip-hop icons best known for their misogynistic lyrics actually include tracks on their albums that show a softer side appropriate for any romantic situation.
LL Cool J showed us the way back in 1987 with “I Need Love,” on which he dropped emotional rhymes: You can scratch my back, we’ll get cozy and huddle / I’ll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle.
Even the rappers who talk the most about mistreating women have songs that reveal their vulnerable sides.
For instance, in  50 Cent’s “P.I.M.P.,” he brags Man, bitches come and go, every ni**a pimpin’ know. But he also has “21 Questions,” in which he shows his shy, sensitive side by asking, If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me? / If I didn’t smell so good would you still hug me?
Lil Wayne also frequently talks down to women like the rap greats that came before him. But on the not-so-romantically named song “P****, Money, Weed,” he delivers a complex, clever and yet underrated hip-hop love song.
Coming from Lil Wayne, the chorus I love her / like p****, money, weed is a huge compliment. Lyrics such as Oh yes I love her like I ought to / I see you at the altar, Mrs. Carter / I see you with my daughter / or son, more than one, show Wayne’s softer side, while the rest of the lyrics are surprisingly sweet, albeit occasionally dirty.
Not even Beyoncé is immune to this, as she created the hit song praising “Single Ladies,” despite being one half of the most powerful and talented couple in hip-hop through her marriage to Jay-Z.
Back in 2003, however, the then-unmarried couple updated 2Pac’s 1996 love song about his gun with “Bonnie & Clyde ’03,” which has a chorus of Jay-Z asserting All I need in this life of sin / Is me and my girlfriend and Beyoncé responding Down to ride ’til the very end / Just me and my boyfriend. Jay-Z’s lyrics endearingly describe his love for the bootylicious Beyoncé, but he’s made numerous records about being successful with the ladies since ’03.
Despite these few examples of hip-hop love songs, the misogynistic and sexist themes remain prevalent.
Somewhat since the dawn of the genre, but definitely since the era of gangster rap, themes of braggadocio, misogyny and homophobia have tended to dominate hip-hop songs.
There have been artists who have challenged this status quo and defied hip-hop stereotypes, but much of the popular stuff remains the same.
50 Cent released a few sensitive songs to keep his female fan base interested, but there are plenty 50 Cent songs about getting tons of women and not caring about them.
The same goes for almost every other prominent and popular rapper in history.
The low expectations for rappers’ ability to craft love songs is exactly what makes those songs great.
We expect R&B songs to be about love, so they’re often cheesy or dismissed as baby-making music.
There are plenty of great rock and country love songs, but that’s exactly the point. There are already so many that it’s nothing exciting when a new one appears.
When rappers known for any degree of misogyny make a love song, we see a side of them that’s human.
They might prefer to have lots of different female companions, but they’re not immune to the concept of love.
So if you have a girl like Beyoncé or a guy like Jay-Z, consider going beyond the norm and playing them some of the aforementioned songs this upcoming Valentine’s Day.

Nestled in Culver City, Calif. in the Helms Bakery District lies a hybrid, gastronomic treasure.
On Helms Avenue, next to the already renowned gastropub Father’s Office, Lukshon stands as the district’s newest and most intriguing addition.
Treasure hunt · Lukshon’s location on Helms Avenue puts it close to other eateries, but its distinct Southeast Asian flavors make it stand out. - Cory Sanford | Daily Trojan 
Upon entering Lukshon, you are immediately drawn to the dimly lit, inventive interior, highlighted by wooden wall panels and Southeast Asian designs.
Once inside, customers have four dining options: outside, on a cozy porch with a sleek fire pit; inside, at the kitchen counter; in the dining room, the most intimate section of the restaurant, with booths and small one-on-one tables; or in the foyer area, in the middle of the restaurant.
Created by Yang Soon, the same mastermind behind Father’s Office, Lukshon presents traditional Southeast Asian flavors in conjunction with a modern culinary approach.
Soon’s menu incorporates a diverse litany of gourmet creations that have Dutch, French and Portuguese influences, making the dishes nonpareil experiences.
The menu is broken up into “teas,” “raw,” “small,” “big,” “noodles,” “rice” and “sides,” cursory sub-menus with promising constituents.
It is separated into specific areas, but the chef is the one who decides the sequence of the customer’s order, making Lukshon’s clientele submit to the whims of the cook’s creative process. One might think of this as a bit of a gamble, but at Lukshon this twist adds to the excitement of the dining experience.
Just with the teas, you can discern Lukshon’s overall creative flavors. The dragon pearl jasmine supreme stands out with its alluring jasmine fragrance and a peculiar taste that obfuscates the senses, since the tea tastes exactly how it smells.
Moving on to the heavier fare, the beef tartare trumps the list of raw dish options with its moist texture and its fresh, herbal tang.
Presented on a delicately sliced cucumber that adds a brisk, watery kick, the beef tartare is an appealing dish to kick off the Lukshon experience.
The “small” options also pack satisfying punches, especially the shrimp toast and spicy chicken pops.
The shrimp toast is a modified recipe, as the formula calls for shrimp and croutons deep-fried together with a spice sauce drizzled atop.
This creates an initially atypical flavor not associated with a shrimp dish, but one that is surprisingly attractive.
Brought to the table like a platter of lollipops, the spicy chicken pops are an intriguing appetizer.
The minute cutlets of chicken crunch like candy, with a hint of sweetness too, but overwhelm the taste buds with an acute spiciness.
Next up is Lukshon’s diverse array of entrees, which brings compelling options to the table, like the short rib rendang and the garlic pork belly.
The former comes accompanied with square, coconut rice cakes, pea tendrils and cilantro.
The short rib slices almost melt in your mouth, and have a deceivingly milky texture.
The meat lacks genuine taste, however, and is quite boring, failing to match the rousing qualities of Lukshon’s other selections.
The garlic pork belly, though, is a stunning surprise. The garlic is not too strong, and the meat works in conjunction with greens and cylindrical rice cakes to produce an uncanny combination.
To top this, Lukshon presents arguably its most notorious dish: the dan dan noodles.
The waiters and waitresses issue caveats with regard to this dish —  once you eat it, you will not be able to taste anything for the rest of the meal.
At first, the nefarious noodles tingle the tongue and resonate throughout the mouth with a subtle zest.
After several bites, though, the tongue becomes numb and the insides of the mouth rage with what feels like a merciless inferno.
The dining experience comes to an end with two complimentary, shot-size desserts: a kiwi soup and a mango panna cotta.
Both desserts contain rushing waves of fruity flavor, the former a little too much, and the latter more on the lighter side.
And as a dessert encore, Lukshon offers coffee.
One of Lukshon’s coffees is an iced Vietnamese blend chilled for 18 hours that could hold its own against coffee drinks from Intelligentsia.
The iced Vietnamese coffee strikes fiercely with a strong oak taste, but it is addictive, and as soon as the first sip comes, the last sip is soon to follow.
Lukshon, Yang Soon’s inventive brainchild, is a masterpiece of a restaurant, offering complimentary services, sundry gourmet dishes and creative cooks, not to mention cordial employees and an appealing, lustrous vibe and design.
Lukshon is located on 3239 Helms Ave., Culver City. It is open for dinner Monday to Saturday from 5:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
Nice review – but his name is Sang Yoon, not Yang Soon…

Residential senator Chelsea Jia was sworn in Tuesday, replacing Makhala Greene-Robinson, who left for personal reasons.
Jia, a sophomore majoring in business and accounting, was the seventh runner-up in last year’s elections.
“I just got an email from Nehi yesterday,” Jia said. “I was kind of surprised. I already put a lot of work in the campaigning last year and I felt like I needed to grab this opportunity while I could.”
Jia will serve out the remainder of Greene-Robinson’s term, but does not have any platform goals at the moment.
“It’s only been a few hours since I jumped on this,” she said. “But I think it’s going to be a really good experience.”
Vice President Nehi Ogbevoen said that USG was excited to get some “new energy” in its senate, and that the transition is expected to go smoothly.
“The current senators are great so they should help her transition well,” he said. “This should be an easy transition —it’s a little bit of an awkward time — but I’m sure it’ll work out great.”

Lamar Hunt, the legendary Kansas City Chiefs owner, originally intended for the “Super Bowl” name to be temporary.
He thought the name was silly, and used it just as a holdover. Eventually, it’d be replaced with something bigger, something better.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
His vision evolved into one of the watershed cultural events in America, demonstrating how as a society we focus on expansion, improvement and eventual perfection of basic ideas. Super Bowl I had a TV audience of 51 million and an attendance of 61,496.
Compare that to the 111 million who watched Super Bowl XLV on Sunday, making it the highest-rated television event in U.S. history. The attendance was 103,129 — the second highest in Super Bowl history.
The Super Bowl has become a larger-than-life event not because of the magnitude of the game, but because of the glitz and glamour that accompany it.
The lavish parties in the week leading up to the game are littered with celebrities and sponsored by the top companies — Playboy and ESPN held parties last week.
Top American companies are paying between $2.5 and $2.8 million for a 30-second advertisement.
Typically, people avoid commercials, but during the Super Bowl the commercials are almost as big a draw as the game itself.
The recap of the advertisements becomes national discussion because some people like their Doritos more than others.
Casual fans take sides, rooting passionately for a team that they have no allegiance to. They probably don’t even know five players on the roster.
When Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson caught a superb touchdown pass, the room I was watching in exploded. Then, the conversation turned to, “Who is Jordy Nelson?” Good question.
It seems the game takes a backseat for most people, because they choose to focus on the halftime show, the commercials, the food or even the alcohol, all of which have made the Super Bowl an unofficial national holiday.
The game becomes instant watercooler talk and gives people common ground. It’s a championship game that, somehow, is not all about the game itself — and that has led to a massive audience, because there is something for everyone.
While I might be intently watching the actual game, my little sister will be eagerly waiting for the Black Eyed Peas to perform their horrendous rendition of “Sweet Child o’Mine.”
The crowds for these Super Bowl viewing parties are incredibly diverse in demographic and age, yet they all huddle around the TV watching the same program.
This is a unique event in modern America, where a family usually can rarely agree on what to watch because of the widened availability of channels.
The Super Bowl, at its core, is a football game. But it’s so much more than that. If it were just about the result of a football game, 111 million people wouldn’t be watching it. This is more than just football.
It’s about people taking a vested interest in a sport they criticize for being brutish and violent for the other 364 days of the year.
Definitely not what Lamar Hunt had in mind.

Los Angeles is approximately 7,600 miles away from Egypt.
Yet, I’ve been feeling connected to these demonstrations. As someone intending to pursue a career in journalism, how could I not?
Much has been made of President Hosni Mubarak’s decision to shut down internet and cell phone services, but recently the press has focused on the dangers both Western and Arabic journalists face upon entering Egyptian borders.
Mubarak’s National Democratic Party recently claimed the Western media and Al-Jazeera are, more than anyone else, responsible for the recent violence. And, somehow, people buy it.
As Mubarak’s regime has vilified journalism, reporters have become the primary targets of NDP supporters. Much of this began with Al-Jazeera Cairo, which continued to broadcast the protests long after the station was supposed to have been cut off.
In response, the dictatorship shut down Al-Jazeera’s office, which was later broken into and torched by angry vigilantes.
Pro-Mubarak protesters also recently attacked CNN’s Anderson Cooper, while CBS’s Katie Couric and ABC’s Christiane Amanpour were threatened and warned to stop broadcasting.
The demonstrations have already claimed one journalist’s life: Photographer Ahmed Mahmoud was shot by a sniper while filming a conflict between Egyptian riot police and pro-democracy demonstrators from the balcony of his own home.
This was just the start. There were 101 reported instances of such violence in the last week alone.
It’s remarkable just how easily the media can be made a scapegoat. If the people you would normally receive your information from aren’t acting in your best interests, your only choice is to believe whatever your government tells you.
Looking back, I can see a parallel between what the current events in Egypt and the chaos surrounding WikiLeaks.
The way the government and television media responded to the unauthorized release of controversial information  was revolting.
The leaks themselves were not the news — it was the guy who leaked it, Julian Assange. By being exposed to all the dangers that occurred because of the leaks, and not the content of the leaks, the public was distracted from the real news.
It was a very media-friendly topic: Assange became America’s real-life Bond villain.
The sex allegations, the use of buzzwords like “hacker,” “anarchist” and “high-tech terrorist,” Sarah Palin’s public statement that he ought to be hunted down like bin Laden —everything came together to produce hours of primetime broadcasting that entirely missed the point.
As all this was happening, tensions were growing in Spain over a particular set of WikiLeaks cables that focused on the 2003 death of Spanish cameraman Jose Couso, who died while standing on the balcony of the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad.
The building was full of journalists from around the world risking their lives, not unlike Cooper and Couric, to publicize the truth from the ground in Iraq. Couso’s death, along with numerous journalist and non-journalist casualties, was the result of American tank fire, according to the cables.
The event went virtually unnoticed by the American media, only revealed seven years later by a WikiLeaks embassy cable.
As it turns out, the Couso family had tried to sue, but the U.S. ambassador to Spain manipulated, on orders, the Spanish judicial system into dismissing the case, according to the Spain Review. It would have been bad press for the United States for the same reasons that we are up in arms today about Mubarak.
That was in December. On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, who cared? Who even knew?
I certainly didn’t. All I knew was that Julian Assange was being accused of sexual misconduct in Sweden.
This frustrated me at the beginning of the new year. Now, looking at CNN’s dramatic footage of Anderson Cooper being assaulted, I’m furious. And I’m scared. The scapegoating of journalists is becoming an international trend.
We look down upon it when the free flow of information does us no harm, but as soon as American hegemony is threatened, as soon as our flaws are revealed, suddenly the messenger becomes accountable and whatever it was he had to say doesn’t mean anything anymore.
Such politics of fear have no place in a society where reason, logic and effective civic discourse must take precedent over intrusion from outside forces.
Greg Irwin is a freshman majoring in international relations.
First comment and Diane are absolutely mentally challenged, you clearly didn’t read the article.
Pretentious idiots.
Thanks for the good input… I read the article and considered it very carefully.  See my comments below to see why I think it is poorly thought out.
And it sounds like you’re taking this a little personally, why else would someone bitterly call other people “mentally challenged”, as if that’s some sort of mature insult.
Um this article makes no sense.  It’s title is “Blaming journalists is no solution to the egypt crisis”, but no one at all has blamed journalists.  The Egyptian government has attacked and silence them to preserve their own interests, but no one is blaming journalists for taking the risk.  This article is completely pointless and thoughtless from the start.
Aren’t there editors here that can see when an article is bad?
Indeed. Methinks Greg needs to take some courses in critical thinking. Ease up there, young man. Nobody’s blaming poor little Katie C. and the blue-eyed wonder boy Anderson for the the turmoil in Egypt. *rolleyes*
You’re misreading the content based on an unfortunate headline. I’m not saying Americans are blaming journalists for the protests; I’m saying that Mubarak is, and that the fact that he has succeeded is disturbing. My comparison is based on the American response to WikiLeaks, in which the US media vilified Julian Assange–a man I would consider, under the circumstances, to be a journalist intending to spread truth, no different from Anderson or Couric. I’m associating the two given that both allowed the journalist to become the public villain, claiming that his reporting on the government’s faults is evil, rather than the government itself for committing its wrongdoings.
Sorry but you’re missing the point.  Mubarak hasn’t “blamed” and journalists.  In fact, to the public and the press, his government is very careful to praise journalists and guarantee their safety.  In reality, they are stifling the press and abusing journalists because they don’t want the real story to get out.  But no one is blaming journalists for anything, including Mubarak and the government. And again, he has NOT succeeded in “blaming” journalists- the entire world is condemning him and his government’s actions towards journalists. He hasn’t even succeeded in stifling journalists, let alone blaming them, so what exactly are you disturbed that he is succeeding at?
There is no comparison between the journalists and Assange, because while Assange has been somewhat vilified and slandered, the journalists haven’t! Not one bit! There’s no one in the world, including Mubarak, who is publicly slandering or vilifying the journalist.  That’s why I don’t understand what in the world this article is trying to say. It just makes no sense.
Please don’t tell me that I’m missing the point. If Dr. Ibrahim Kamel, Secretary-General of Mubarak’s party, has been quoted as saying that journalists have been misreporting information in the attempt to incite chaos in Egypt, and the Egyptian police force has been attacking and interfering with foreign journalists, both of these ARE acts of the government accusing and vilifying journalists as either causing or, at the very least, amplifying the problem.
Furthermore, if Mubarak’s supporters have been attempting to perform vigilante justice, physically assaulting reporters and destroying Al-Jazeera Cairo, Mubarak and Co. HAVE succeeded in convincing a substantial portion of their constituency that journalists are the problem. I’m not talking about journalists being blamed in the international spectrum; I’m talking about trickery and scapegoating on the domestic level. Even if you run a quick Google search–more than the police force of Egypt, protesting Egyptian citizens have been specifically attacking journalists. If they don’t think the journalists are causing problems, why would they take such action?
I apologize, by the way: Kamel is a member of the general secretariat of the party–never the Secretary-General. This shouldn’t affect anything else I said, though. He’s still an arm of the government.
Wow you are completely misreading the entire situation and what is going on there.  These “pro-Mubarak” supporters you are talking about that are attacking journalists and Al-Jazeera headquarters are plain-clothed police and people hired by the security services!  To think that they are clashing with the anti-Mubarak supporters or journalists because they have been convinced that journalists are bad or misreporting is ludicrous.  One of the most important points of this entire story is that the people are not divided, and are united against the government.  To think that there is a large and active group that have somehow been convinced to harass journalists is an extremely amateur and incorrect take.  The government itself has been responsible for these actions, but have not succeeded in persuading anyone that journalists should be blamed.  When Dr. Kamel said that journalists have been misreporting information, he meant that they have been misreporting that there has been abuse of journalists, not that journalists should be blamed.  The government there would be foolish to say to the world that this is journalists fault. They are trying to save face!  When they attack and journalists, they are doing the OPPOSITE of vilifying them in the public light, they are trying to shut them up behind closed doors!
I think it is just time to own up to the main flaw of the argument, which is so blatantly and clearly out in the open. It is not a bad thing to rethink one’s position and learn from mistakes.  It’s just that this article talks about such a non-issue, and is such a complete misreading of the situation.  Trickery and scapegoating has not at all worked in Egypt, which is exactly the point, exactly why the protesters have been successful.  When the government beats people, they are not succeeding in blaming journalists, but just the contrary.
Alright, so after this, I’m done. I very much appreciate your dedication to accurate journalism, and willingness to take the time to clarify details in the situation and various flaws in this article.
I will admit I was largely unaware of the scale to which Mubarak’s men were involved in the protests. This certainly decreases, in turn, the magnitude of my argument as well. At the time of my pitching of the article, such information had not yet been released and upon my writing it, I failed to research this aspect of the scenario, and am shocked and disappointed that I did so.
This being said, what the protesters (the majority of whom are, admittedly, police or paid by Mubarak, but it seems presumptuous to assume that ALL of them are, when relatively few have come open) have been saying as to their frustration:
“I asked several protesters why they were so angry, and they accused our coverage of bias against the government, of “hyping” the protests” (Al-Jazeera). You don’t think, then, that in all these mobs, none of these people believe what they’re saying?
As I said, I’m done now. The intended focus of my article was to be predominantly in regards to my anger over the WikiLeaks scenario, and I’ve unwittingly found myself, due to an excessive fear of being proven wrong, in an argument further distracting me from what I was trying to get across. Once again, thank you for the wiser criticisms–yet avoiding internet insults such as those above, especially when your name isn’t out in the open, makes you seem a little more polite and is guaranteed to offend a first-time writer attempting to challenge the USC community, even if he did bite off a little more than he could chew.

According to a recently released report from Inside Higher Ed, 53 of the 120 universities in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) were found to have committed major rules violations by the NCAA’s Division 1 Committee on Infractions, from 2001 to 2010.
Over the past decade, the numbers of violations committed by major universityies, as determined by the COI, has doubled, as outlined in the report.
Some experts, as a result, have raised concerns over the increasing academic violations within collegiate athletic departments.
“We’re admitting more people who really don’t belong there” Gene A. Marsh, a retired University of Alabama law professor told Inside Higher Ed, “and [were] spending millions on academic support to keep them there.”
In the report, the NCAA found there was a “lack of institutional control” at 14 different universities from 2001-2010.
The “lack of institutional control” label is considered one of the most serious violations, suggesting that an athletic department doesn’t have the forceful policies needed to oversea whether coaches, players and other officials comply with NCAA rules.USC was similarly penalized in June of 2010, stemming from the inelgibility of two former student-athletes Reggie Bush (football) and O.J. Mayo (basketball.).
If academic violations continue it might eventually prompt the NCAA to change its eligibility rules, lowering the minimum academic requirements for freshman, and give penalties to teams and colleges whose athletes don’t make consistent progress toward a degree.

Following Tuesday’s practice, the Daily Trojan caught up with USC forward Nikola Vucevic, who is looking to help the Trojans avoid what could be a third consecutive loss on Thursday against Oregon State. He remarked about bearing the responsibility of playing heavy minutes down the stretch for the second straight season.
On the effect of last year’s stretch run:
I think It definitely helps. Last year was my first year playing heavy minutes, so I really didn’t know how to take care of my body. Now I know how it is and what I need to do in order to play that many minutes. So, I’m really just more experienced with that.
On becoming a leader:
It’s been a huge change for me. I’ve never been in this position before, and it was a huge change, where I have needed time to adjust. At the beginning of the season I wasn’t doing the best job of it, and I had meetings with [coach Kevin O’Neill], where I was talking about how to become a better leader. As the season has gone on, though, I’ve become more vocal and done a better job of leading the team.
On facing a zone defense:
We have to open ball games better. When we were playing at Oregon and Oregon State before, we opened the game badly, they got 10-point leads right away and we had to fight to get back into the game. So, we have to open the game the right way, which means playing hard on defense and not letting them score easily. Once we get scoring on defense, that’s when our offense gets going.
On the team’s offensive struggles against UCLA:
I think the problem was that there was a stretch, where we didn’t take good shots. We took a lot of jumpers and we’re not a great jump-shooting team. We don’t make a ton of threes. It’s not our personality; we have to go inside. We were taking bad shots and that really affected us. They got a lead and it was hard to come back.

Mechanical problems at an off-campus ITS data center Tuesday morning caused disruptions to Internet, blackboard, phone and USC e-mail access across campus.
“At approximately 7:45 am, an electrical problem in the university’s data center triggered the center’s fire suppression system and shut down the supply of power to multiple IT systems,” said ITS Director of Communications and Marketing Kevin Durkin. “The fire department was immediately notified and the building was evacuated.”
Those who called ITS asking for assistance heard a recording acknowledging that there have been issues this morning.
“This is Tuesday Feb. 8 at 9:55 a.m. We are experiencing network outages and major system failures including email and website features. We have no ETA at this time,” the recording said.
Most issues seemed to be resolved by about 1:00 p.m., though some students still reported issues getting online.
“As of this moment, e-mail, phone, Blackboard and most websites service including the main USC website services have been restored and users can now connect to the wired network,” Durkin said at 1:15 p.m. “Wireless connectivity is available but some users may experience a delay or time out.” Mechanical problems at an off-campus ITS data center Tuesday morning caused disruptions to Internet, blackboard, phone and USC e-mail access across campus.

The Academy Awards Nominee Luncheon was held at the International Ballroom at the Beverly Hilton on Monday, honoring the lucky few who have been nominated for an Oscar this year.
The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences welcomes their fellow nominees to a luncheon each year and allows them all to meet before the big show. There were 151 nominees in attendance, making this the largest nominee luncheon ever.
The gathering is an opportunity for some of these talented artists to come together and perhaps meet for the first time. In fact, everyone is seated at random, which allows people from different films to sit with each other. Nominees were also presented with an instructional video produced by Tom Hanks teaches them how to give a proper speech.
The luncheon included many familiar faces and favorites, including everyone from 14-year-old Hailee Steinfeld to Jeff Bridges, Darren Aronofsky and a pregnant Natalie Portman.
The notable absences included David Fincher and Christian Bale, who were both missing from the luncheon.
The 83rd Academy Awards will be presented on Feb. 27 at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.

Many people might know Taylor Momsen as Jenny Humphrey from the CW television show, Gossip Girl.
However, this young teenager has a whole different side to her that is bursting onto the scene because today marks the release of her band’s first studio album. Fronted by Momsen, The Pretty Reckless also features Ben Phillips on guitar, Kato Khandwala on bass and Jamie Perkins on drums. Make no mistake, though, their debut record Light Me Up is no cookie-cutter pop music album, it is a hard-hitting rock-n-roll treat that features the 17-year-old Momsen singing flawlessly like a hardened thirty year-old with mature lyrics to match her voice.
“My Medicine” kicks off the record with attention-grabbing stop-and-go guitar strumming as Momsen’s vocals show right off the bat that she belongs in the music industry. “Since You’re Gone” features a furiously grooving bassline that drives the song with even raspier vocals from Momsen before the catchy, dark and anthemic “Make Me Wanna Die” blares through the speakers. Listeners might recognize this song from the film Kick-Ass released in 2010.
“Light Me Up” has a slight twang to it with poppier sentiments but the subsequent track, “Zombie,” returns to the hard rock theme. It is haunting and hard-hitting with Momsen singing lines like “blow the smoke right off the tubes/ kiss my gentle burning bruise.”
Whether it is the pounding drums of “Miss Nothing,” the head-banging chorus from the murderous tale “Goin’ Down,” or the sleazy rock-n-roll spirit of the distorted closer “Factory Girl,” Momsen and crew create songs sure to send fists flying into the air and inspire dirty dancing at shows.
The record, though, is not all about haunting lyrics and aggressive arrangements. It also features several ballads, the best of which is “Just Tonight,” a melodically superb offering with a soaring chorus. “Nothing Left to Lose” is the only track over four minutes and its chorus is reminiscent of Don McLean’s “American Pie.” The penultimate track, however, is the only track that really does not seem to fit in amongst the others as it is a pure love song with soft, falsetto vocals from Momsen over an acoustic guitar.
Light Me Up is a hard rock record that packs a punch and an attitude that make The Pretty Reckless one of the most exciting bands to break onto the scene in quite some time.

This past weekend, the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team had its first big chance to prove itscapability in the pool. It was clear that the girls put in a solid performance in what some would call a repeat match of last year NCAA championship game, where USC prevailed 10-9. However, this time the tables turned and the Women of Troy came in close second to No. 1 Stanford after a sudden death overtime loss of 10-9 in the championship game.
“It’s early in the season. We have so many new faces and we didn’t know what we were going to do and how we were going to look, especially with the new goalie. Patricia Jansco has been injured, and everything was really uncertain for us” said coach Jovan Vavic.
The invitational started out well for the Trojans on Saturday. The team trounced No. 15 Indiana with a 9-1 victory, and beat crosstown rival No. 4 UCLA 10-8. Junior driver Nadia Dan stepped up on Saturday, scoring three goals in each game, and senior two-meter Kristen Dronberger continued to prove herself as a threat with one goal against Indiana and three against UCLA.
The only thing standing in the way of the championship game at that point was No. 5 Hawaii. Nadia Dan stepped up once again and scored another hat trick, leading the Trojans to a 9-7 victory over the Rainbow Wahine. Then came their chance to shine and prove themselves against the host Cardinal.
The game was heated and tense the entire way, with Dronberger and freshman two-meter Madeline Rosenthal leading the way for the Trojans. Dronberger had the biggest game of all, scoring four goals, while Rosenthal had two.
The Women of Troy put up a fight, staying close the entire game to force it into sudden death. Although much of the sudden death time span was scoreless, all that mattered was Stanford’s close range strike that occurred with about 25 seconds left.
Although the Women of Troy came in second place at Stanford, it is still early in the season to make assumptions about how the team will fair. Many players showed that they were huge threats to look out for, including Dronberger, Dan and rookie goalie Flora Bolonyai.
This tournament, however, has proven to the team that they can rise to any challenge. This is especially important for the team newcomers, including Bolonyai, who played goalie this entire tournament coming in as a freshman.
“This is huge for our rookies” Vavic said. “As the season goes on, they will be able to look back on this and understand that they were ready to play. Many times, you just question your abilities. Now, they will be able to see that they can actually play well. It’s a huge confidence booster.”
One thing is for sure: next time Stanford comes around, the team will be prepared. Seeing Stanford at the UC Irvine Invitational in two weeks is a possibility, as well. But right now, the team just wants to focus on the games that are directly in front of them in order to build a stronger team.
“The girls really showed they had a lot of heart. Our younger players stepped it up, and our returning players were outstanding. ” Vavic said.
