Looking to shake off a rough start to the new year, the defending NCAA champion USC men’s tennis team will try to divide and conquer at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup this weekend. From today through Jan. 19, the Trojans will partake in singles and doubles individual tournaments in Westlake Village, Calif., along with competitors from Baylor, Stanford and UCLA.
The USC men’s tennis team collectively struggled in its first tournament of 2015, the Southern California United States Tennis Association Pro Futures Circuit event – senior Eric Johnson was the lone Trojan able to progress beyond the first round of singles competition, only to fall in the second round, and in doubles, the No. 1-ranked senior duo of Roberto Quiroz and Yannick Hanfmann was eliminated in the tournament quarterfinals.
Following the USTA Pro Futures Circuit event, head coach Peter Smith cited a lack of match fitness from the holiday layover as a primary factor for his team’s woes.
“It’s kind of like waking in the morning and not having your coffee,” Smith said. “That was their introduction to the new year. They woke up and went ‘Oh man. Alright, I do have to play at this level.’ To be honest, they were playing against some top competition, so it was the perfect way to start the new year.”
After coming back and turning it up a notch in practice this week, Smith is confident that the defending champion Trojans will return to form at Sherwood during the weekend.
“We’re playing much better,” Smith said. “They enjoyed Christmas, what can I say. They’ve gotten into the routine, they’ve gotten their workouts. [The USTA Pro Circuit] put a sense of urgency to their workouts this week, and everyone really played a lot better – a couple levels higher this week.”
Of the 32 singles and 16 doubles entries, four individual Trojans and two USC tandems are seeded in the tournament. In singles, Hanfmann earned the No. 1 seed in the competition. Senior Jonny Wang enters as the No. 4 seed, followed by sophomore Nick Crystal at the No. 6 spot and rounded out with Quiroz in the No. 7 ranking. In doubles play, the pair of Hanfmann and Johnson take the No. 2 seed, with the duo of Quiroz and junior Max de Vroome set at the No. 4 spot.
The remaining top eight seeds for singles pit Baylor’s Julian Lenz at No. 2, UCLA’s Mackenzie McDonald at No. 4, and Stanford’s Tom Fawcett and David Hsu at No. 5 and No. 8 respectively. UCLA’s team of McDonald and Martin Redlicki top the doubles bracket, while Baylor’s pair of Lenz and Felipe Rios take the No. 3 seed in team competition.
“Every time you enter a tournament, you expect it to be as tough as any other,” sophomore Connor Farren said. “I think it’s going to be a great competition, and hopefully we can get better every match.”
Last year in the Sherwood Collegiate Cup, then-junior Quiroz reached the singles quarterfinals and then-sophomore Vroome won the consolation tournament in singles play. Quiroz and then-freshman Farren battled their way to the semifinals of last year’s Sherwood doubles tournament.
With a team of half underclassmen this year, Smith will use the Cup as a diagnostic for the level at which his players are competing.
“A lot of the lineup has been established through the fall season, but it’s a fresh look to see how everyone is playing,” Smith said. “It’s really just to see where everybody’s at on the court.”
The team’s freshmen will get their first taste of spring competition this weekend. Freshman Tanner Smith, set to make his regular season debut at Sherwood, feels the longtime powerhouse tennis program has primed him for collegiate competition.
“Our seniors are great, they really know how to push us,” Smith said. “It’s just so exciting, being surrounded by so many good players. This [tournament] is going to be fun”
Still in the opening stages of the spring season, the Trojans will hope to gain early momentum as they shake off the rust and pursue their sixth NCAA championship in seven years.
“When you sign up to come to USC, whether you’re a player or a coach, the tradition here is good and the expectation is to do the best,” Smith said. “But to do that, you have to prepare your best.”

The USC women’s basketball team will travel across town to Westwood to take on UCLA at Pauley Pavilion on Sunday, Jan. 18 at 7:30 p.m.
The Women of Troy (11-5, 3-2 Pac-12) will look to avenge a 59-52 loss at the hands of the Bruins on Dec. 30 at the Galen Center. Freshman guard McKenzie Calvert led USC with 16 points in the contest, with senior forward Kaneisha Horn adding 12 points and 7 rebounds, as USC went cold from behind the arc, going 3-for-22 in the contest.
Recee Caldwell led UCLA (7-9, 3-2 Pac-12) with 17 points. The Women of Troy are now 47-40 all-time against the Bruins, but are 4-5 against UCLA since the 2010-11 season, as the two rivals have alternated sweeping the season series.
“We gotta work on our zone,” said redshirt sophomore guard Jordan Adams about what the team learned from last month’s loss to the Bruins. “I think we came out with the right energy, I just think that we didn’t execute the way that we wanted to and we play better as a team than we do as individuals. I think we tried to either rely on a couple [of] individuals too much or only rely on ourselves and we should have shared the ball more, and we should have played more as a team. Had we done that I think that the outcome would have been different.”
Since the loss to UCLA, USC has won three of their last four games, including completing a road sweep last weekend with an 81-61 win against Colorado (7-8, 0-4 Pac-12) and a 46-43 win against Utah (6-9, 0-4 Pac-12). Senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama and Calvert each scored 20 points against the Buffaloes, while junior guard Brianna Barrett added 17 points and 6 rebounds. Barrett followed that up with 13 points against the Utes, making her the only double-digit scorer for the Women of Troy.
“Our goal as a team is to consistently improve and get better,” said associate head coach Beth Burns. “Whoever is next, whether it’s UCLA, Cal or Stanford—which are the following weekend—we want to continue to improve. We’re coming off a road sweep, which is just huge in our league to be able to win two games on the road, most especially because we had dropped two home games.”
Vaioletama leads USC with 12.8 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. Calvert is averaging 11.9 points per game, while Barrett has 10.7 points per game, and leads the team with 4.5 assists and 2.5 steals per game.
The Bruins are led by Nirra Fields, who is averaging 14.3 points and 6.2 rebounds per game. Jordin Canada is averaging 10.2 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 3.9 assists per game, and leads the team in points (12.7) and assists (5.0) per game during Pac-12 play.
Like USC, the Bruins also completed a road sweep last weekend, pulling out a 49-46 win over the Utes and a 90-84 win over the Buffaloes. Kari Korver led the team with a combined 32 points over the weekend, including leading six double-digit scorers against Colorado.
“The energy that we had was great, especially at Colorado and we kind of lost it when we’re at Utah, but I think the energy needs to be shifted as far as focusing,” said Vaioletama. “Our energy sometimes is great, but it’s not focused on the right things that we do in practice and we do in games.”
The Women of Troy will return to the Galen Center next week to take on California (11-4, 3-1 Pac-12) on Friday, Jan. 23 at 7 p.m. and No. 13 Stanford (12-4, 4-0 Pac-12) on Sunday, Jan. 25 at 5 p.m.

The USC Shoah Foundation and the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism held an advanced screening on Thursday of the new CNN documentary, The Voices of Auschwitz. The documentary will be nationally aired on Jan. 27 to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Auschwitz liberation.
The hour-long feature, hosted by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, detailed the stories of four Holocaust survivors as they recounted the harrowing details of their detention in concentration camps as well as their journeys to rebuild their postwar lives.
The four survivors featured in the film came from all walks of life and experienced Auschwitz from various angles: Eva Kor, who along with her twin was subjected to medical experimentation by the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele; Renée Firestone, whose artistic talents allowed her to thrive as a fashion designer after the war; Martin Greenfield, who learned how to tailor while in the camp and went on to hold a clientele of U.S. presidents and celebrities; and Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, a musician who played cello in the Auschwitz orchestra and whose grandson, also a musician, was in the audience.
The discussion, which was originally scheduled to take place after the screening, was split into two parts — one held before the screening and another impromptu discussion after, to include the delayed arrival of Firestone.
Dr. Stephen D. Smith, the executive director of the Shoah Foundation, moderated the discussion with two CNN panelists: Leora Kapelus,  executive producer, and Jennifer Hyde, the director of development for CNN. He began by introducing the core purpose of the USC Shoah Foundation.
“We should be thinking about how do we use media, journalism and the various digital channels available to us to deliver a message to the world,” he said.
Housed in Leavey Library, the Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education aims to collect and produce audio-visual interviews with survivors and witnesses of the Holocaust and other genocides. The Institute currently holds more than 53,000 eyewitness accounts, making its archives the largest collection of video testimonies from genocide survivors and witnesses in the world.
“We have to really consider how to curate these historical contents,” Smith explained to the audience.
The two CNN panelists shared how the documentary project came to be. According to Kapelus, CNN had originally planned to play segments of Auschwitz stories throughout the day of the 70th anniversary in addition to its usual programming. However, she accumulated so much information through her research that she felt compelled to share the stories through a different, more comprehensive format.
“As we came across more and more phenomenal stories and phenomenal people, we felt [these stories] could not go untold,” Kapelus said, adding that she felt a documentary could make a bigger difference for an audience and could potentially open channels for religious tolerance.
Smith commented how unconventional it was for a current news station like CNN to produce a documentary on events that had happened in the past. In response, Hyde then noted the continued relevancy of Holocaust education, linking it to modern genocides and even the recent Paris attacks, which included a hostage crisis in a kosher market.
“Auschwitz has come to represent something truly inconceivable that happened in the world. As a news network, these are the type stories that we share and thus [Auschwitz] is every bit as relevant now as it was 70 years ago,” she said.
Furthermore, Hyde emphasized how the documentary had CNN’s resources at its disposal to amplify the storytelling even more.
“A very talented team from CNN spent eight or nine days in Auschwitz doing all the shooting. They were able to negotiate to shoot, for example, an actual Mengele instrument or an actual uniform. They managed access to places where film crews normally aren’t able to go,” she told the audience.
After the screening, Firestone was invited to the stage for a Q&A session. The film capitalized on Firestone’s fashion design hobby — it was a pivotal way in which Firestone was able to retain her spirit to survive. She has long since retired from the fashion industry and is now a public speaker for Holocaust education.
“Unfortunately, humanity did not learn very much because the world today is still in terrible shape,” Firestone said. “I keep hoping that humanity will come to senses and stop killing one another. I’m now past 90 years so who’s going to do my job? Who’s going to teach young people to behave, respect and love each other?”

The Marshall School of Business Sports Business Institute hosted Luc Robitaille, president of business operations for the Los Angeles Kings, and Michael Schulman, CEO of the Anaheim Ducks, at Town & Gown on Thursday night for an event called “The Business of Hockey.”
In addition to presentations on management, leadership and navigating the changing landscape of the National Hockey League, the three-hour event included an attendee networking session, a panel discussion with Q&A and a closing reception.
Established in 2005, the Sports Business Institute serves as the destination for knowledge about the sports industry.
“We really thought that we could own thought leadership when it comes to the business of sports,” said David Carter, the executive director of Sports Business Institute. “So we started doing some research, doing some consulting work in the industry and hosting special events like the one we’re doing tonight on the business of hockey.”
Robitaille, the highest scoring left wing National Hockey League in history and the all-time Kings leader in goals scored, explained that there is potential revenue growth in social media.
During the presentation, Robitaille and Schulman agreed that there is not a lot of potential grown in the ticket box but that they are looking to increase revenue by broadcasting hockey games in movie theaters through a deal with NBC Sports.
The speakers also talked about sustaining their fan base through sparking their interest in the sport at an early age. Schulman said that they currently have 41 high school hockey teams mainly in Orange County participating in its 2014-2015 season, and are hoping to target an even younger population — children from 4 to 8 years old — in the near future.
Open to the general public, this event was the inaugural Business of Team Sports event series and had around 250 attendees, many of whom were students and alumni.
“I’m actually a really big Kings fan so I’ve been following them since I was a little girl. Through my program, I’m trying to figure out which source of management I’m interested in,” aid Sara Stevens, a freshman majoring in Management Engineering at Claremont McKenna College.  “Sports have been something I’ve been following since childhood and I just thought that maybe I’ll want to go into it.”
Ghazzal Rezvan, a senior majoring in business administration with a minor in sports media studies, shared the same enthusiasm.
“I’ve always wanted to work in this industry and this event was everything I expected it to be,” Rezvan said.
Rezvan is an intern with the Sports Business Institute and said that Robitaille was a speaker in one of Carter’s courses.
A silent auction featuring Kings and Ducks items was held throughout the duration of the event.
Carter said he hopes to engage the entire community, both academic and those who work in sports.
“We’re going to have a lot of traditional business executives here, folks from local sports franchises, so it’s intended for everybody. We have a strong support of alumni here tonight as well as industry people,” Carter said.

USC Transportation announced a new pilot program with Uber Thursday to supplement the Campus Cruiser program and reduce wait times during peak periods.
The program will be available for the spring semester Thursday through Saturday nights from 8 p.m. until midnight, the busiest hours for Campus Cruiser. The service can only be used when wait times for Campus Cruiser exceed 15 minutes, and Campus Cruiser dispatchers will direct students to the free service when necessary. The rides provided by Cruiser will continue as usual.
“USC already offers a range of transportation choices for students to get around the university area, including regular shuttles, ZipCars and Campus Cruiser,” Director of Transportation Tony Mazza said in a statement. “Some students already use Uber, as well, to supplement their transportation options. The four-month service trial with Uber is expected to decrease student wait times during periods of highest demand, using a familiar option that is easily accessible. We will evaluate this pilot program at the end of the trial period and consider our options.”
Trips that remain inside of Campus Cruiser’s boundaries will be automatically paid for by USC, but students must request the new service by clicking the “USC” button on the Uber application. Trips that begin or end outside of the boundaries of Campus Cruiser will be charged to the user’s account. The USC button will only appear on the application during the program’s hours of operation and when the user is within the boundaries of Campus Cruiser.
USG Director of University Affairs Jordan Fowler and her committee have been working with the administration, particularly USC Transportation, to implement the new program since last summer.
“At the beginning of the summer, my team and I brainstormed this idea as University Affairs within USG,” Fowler said. “Transportation also had plans to revise Campus Cruiser, so we were able to really help place precedence on the issue.”
Long wait times for Campus Cruiser have been a prominent concern at both student and administrative levels. The new partnership with Uber primarily stemmed from an effort to increase student safety both on and around campus.
“President Nikias was really strict in saying that he wanted all the Campus Cruiser calls to have a 15-minute wait time at the very maximum, especially given what happened this summer, so that has really been the main goal,” Fowler said.
Students with USC IDs can be dropped off inside of campus after 8 p.m. However, Uber vehicles will not be able to enter campus to pick students up. Instead, students should meet Uber vehicles outside of campus to be picked up at Entrances 3, 4 or 6, or at the bus turnaround at Jefferson and Trousdale.
Students can access the service through Uber’s mobile application using the promotional code “USC2015.” This code will unlock the USC button on the app. New Uber users can also access the app at uber.com/GO/USC2015. The university will not reimburse rides that are not requested through the USC button.
Since the new program is only a trial for the spring 2015 semester, USC Transportation and USG will both be relying on student feedback to gauge the efficacy of the program and determine areas of improvement.
Students can also submit feedback directly to USC Transportation or to USG. Additional information about the program can be found on Campus Cruiser’s website.
“USC Transportation is a department that really cares about students, and they are really always looking for student feedback, so feedback is definitely going to be crucial to make this better,” Fowler said.
So they are spending our tuition money on a company with questionable ethics instead of actually fixing campus cruiser? Was the goal to just fix the PR issue from last year or to actually make getting around easier?
Throw caution to the wind. The sexual assault cases don’t cause concern I guess.
Will the Uber drivers be vetted in anyway? What’s to stop them from preying on students. How long before someone is robbed or sexually assaulted?
After hundreds of rapes and assault cases in unregulated underinsured uninspected Uber cars, it’s just a matter of time before such “teaming up” will flop disastrously.
