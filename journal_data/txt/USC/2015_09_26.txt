Poke  /poʊˈkeɪ/ , the Hawaiian verb for “section” or “to slice or cut,”is a raw salad served as an appetizer in Hawaiian cuisine. 
Who knew poke was going to be L.A.’s next big food craze? It seems like just yesterday people were asking me what in the world “poke” was, and yet now, you can find it in almost every neighborhood in L.A. A couple months ago, I made it a mission to find the best poke in L.A. Though it’s still an ongoing project, here’s a personal list of the places I’ve been to, listed alphabetically.
1.     Bear Flag Fish Co. (Newport Beach)
I will always consider this place the OG of all poke. Bear Flag was the first poke place I went to in L.A., before the hype started. Their fish is fresh and their choices are simple: tuna or salmon. You can’t go wrong with this Bear Flag, even though it is a little pricier than other options in L.A.
Tip: Keep it simple with a serving of 50/50 tuna and salmon poke with a side of chips.

This place has got to be my favorites so far. From the quality to the price to the serving size, Jus’ Poke is the way to go. The only downside I can find with this place is that they only serve tuna, and salmon is my favorite. I tried the spicy poke and the shoyu poke with a side of seaweed salad and spicy edamame. The flavors all complemented each other.
Tip: Their poke bowl comes with two types of poke and two sides — huge portions, very affordable and filling!

Compared to the poke places I’ve been to by the beach, this place lacked the wow factor. On the plus side, they had a wide variety of flavors and served both tuna and salmon. I tried the spicy tuna poke and salmon poke seaweed salad. Their portion size is a little smaller than usual, which might be why it wasn’t my favorite. All things aside, this place is still pretty good given that it’s located in Hollywood and the prices are very rational.
Tip: Try free samples of the different types of poke before you order.

This place felt like a Chipotle but for poke where you build your own “sushi box.” You pick your base (rice or salad), two types of fish (free crab meat), three sides and your choice of sauce. It wasn’t exactly traditional poke, but it was still pretty filling and affordable.
Tip: Mix and match your sushi bowl with the wide variety of cooked and raw fish available.

I like how this place is conveniently located in one of the most popular beaches in L.A. They have an infinite variety of sides you can choose to have with your poke. Unfortunately for me, they also only serve tuna here. Compared to the other places I’ve been to, Poke Poke did not stand out as much. Nevertheless, it’s still a great spot to grab a quick snack or lunch and chill out by the water.
Tip: Mix it up and add some macadamia nuts to your poke bowl — the crunchy nuttiness adds a whole new level.

The adventure continues as I check out these new up-and-coming poke places around L.A. Since school’s starting to get a little busy, the next few spots I’m planning to hit will be closer to campus:

I hate to admit it, but to say that USC is 110 percent better than UCLA in every facet of life* is a lie. That being said, the only competitive advantage they have over us is that (1) they have a lot of really great food options around them (shout out to Fat Sal’s pizza fries) and (2) they are central to the fancier espresso bars I have on my Coffee Bucket List.
About a month ago, before all the chaos and sadness of academic life rained on my Coffee Tour parade, I hobbled on over into enemy territory to visit a cafe highly recommended by my boss: Espresso Profeta.
Per usual, parking was horrible and highly time consuming. I first attempted to snag one of the metered spots a short walk away, but they were all taken. Very unsurprising as the spots were meant to serve people going into Chipotle, the Boiling Crab and Trader Joe’s. Sad face. My second parking attempt led me into a parking structure that flat out lied to me. Beware: the sign out front says that there’s a $7 a day maximum rate and that is just straight up not true.
Espresso Profeta, or as I recently dubbed them, “EP,” is one of the strangest coffee shops I’ve been to. Their exterior expertly camouflages itself among the neighboring storefronts and shields them from the world even more, there is an overabundance of foliage right outside the entrance. It almost makes it look like EP is hiding from the non-Westwood folk. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have to circle around a couple of times to find it.
From the inside, it looks like someone made an active effort to make the space as inefficient as possible. As soon as you enter the door (if you can find it amongst all the plants), you’re smack dab in front of the baristas. This is extra awkward because they have somehow managed to squeeze three people, a massive espresso machine, and every other espresso-relevant tool behind the world’s smallest counter in a space that I’d estimate to be about four feet wide. Once you get past that, however, seating is fairly standard. According to Yelp, EP is a great place to study, but I will respectfully disagree with that until they can hook it up with as many outlets as Bricks and Scones did.
My trip to EP was on one of those rare days I wanted to try something new. For the occasion, I asked one of the baristas (or all of them, I guess — judging by the size of their workspace, I’d say they were all within earshot) for a recommendation and she convinced me to go with their “most popular drink,” the Caffé Nico.

#ragrets. Not only was it mind-bogglingly expensive, the Caffé Nicco was very much unlike what I expected. For some reason, I was anticipating something more along the lines of a Freddo, which has two shots of espresso shaken over ice with brown sugar and agave syrup until slightly slushy. Nope. In fact, the Caffé Nicco is a cinnamon-dusted, freshly-pulled shot of espresso paired with an orange zest, and while it wasn’t bad, it wasn’t what I wanted. At all, or probably ever.
Coffee Tour let me down that day. Maybe if I could find it in my caffeine-pumping heart to forgive them for the wrongs they did me, I’ll return to try something that isn’t orangey espresso.
Try it for yourself! Espresso Profeta is located at 1129 Glendon Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90024. 
*If you hate food and coffee, then yeah, USC is 110 percent better than UCLA in every facet of life.
