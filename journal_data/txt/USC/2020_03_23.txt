Joe Exotic is the gun-toting, gay, polyamorous, tiger-breeding owner of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Garvin County, Okla. His life and the thriving subculture of big cat owners are the subjects of Netflix’s newest docuseries “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness” released March 20. The series begins with a call from an incarcerated Joe Exotic declaring his innocence, then jumps back to five years earlier when the drama begins to unfold. 
In just seven episodes, directors Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin tell the convoluted story of Exotic versus Carole Baskin, the owner of Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, Fla. In the first few episodes, a decades-long feud is initially painted as an ideological standoff — a man emotionally connected to his animals with a mission to preserve their magnificence against a woman who believes those animals are abusively imprisoned and need to be rescued into her seemingly safe facility. As the series progresses, financial gain, legal battles and personal vendettas are revealed on both sides, leaving audiences to form their own opinions about the validity of each antagonist.
Exotic is a natural showman, with beginnings in magic performances that involved his tiger cubs. He is addicted to power. Whether this comes from breeding an army of tigers, promoting cub petting or seeking fame through reality shows, once the cameras start rolling, he milks the spotlight. His personality makes for addicting entertainment as even his daily routine is a spectacle. Audiences witness his life at the zoo, his numerous marriages and campaigns for president and governor, but also his grief, hatred and descent into madness, which ultimately leads him to hire someone to murder his rival Baskin.
The people and plotline are so absurd it is hard to believe the program is unscripted, but the glimpse into this bizarre world is what makes “Tiger King” irresistible. Exotic is an obvious entertainer and the primary subject of the series, but each of his eccentric employees have unique stories and an undying devotion to big cats. One employee even had her arm bitten off by a tiger and went back to work in the tiger’s cage only five days after it was amputated. Meanwhile, Baskin owns solely cat-printed belongings and is referred to as the “Mother Teresa” of big cats by a sanctuary-goer, even though she is revealed to have a dark, unsolved past as shady as anyone else in the series. 
The genius of this docuseries is also its danger — it pulls audiences to empathize with the antagonists. The story is laced with mysterious deaths and illegal activity from all sides, but Goode and Chaiklin take the time in the first few episodes to journey back to the childhood trauma and humble beginnings of both Exotic and Baskin; their interest in big cats came from a noble desire to save them. Both truly love their animals and believe what they are doing is best. There is hatred, malpractice and slander on both sides, but ultimately only one party wins. 
Yet the series ends in moral ambiguity, no one wins, but the animals ultimately lose. The life of Exotic is a spectacular trainwreck you cannot turn away from.

The world is at a complete standstill. I’ve been practicing social distancing in my hometown of Montreal for a week now and have spent a lot of time wondering what this week’s column would hold. The internet is exploding with coronavirus takes⁠ — a few hot, some lukewarm and most stone-cold. My opinions on the chaos surrounding the global health crisis have evolved, taking on new forms as I surf through Twitter, Instagram and a handful of news outlets, but throughout, one quote from Nobel Prize-winning physicist Niels Bohr has continued to ring true: “The opposite of a fact is a falsehood. But the opposite of one profound truth may very well be another profound truth.”
I know that’s not the most helpful thing to hear; people are scared and they want answers — preferably binary ones. Unfortunately, this is more a time to be patient and reflect than one for resolution. In that same vein, I want to talk about how this pandemic has put a spotlight on how incongruent, for better or for worse, our globalized world can be. More importantly, I want to point out the role mass media and the internet have in skewing this pluralism. 
On one hand, the coronavirus outbreak is decisively a lesson on the dangers of a censored press. Chinese doctor Li Wenliang attempted to warn medics about the SARS-like virus in early December (well before authorities confirmed the outbreak of a novel coronavirus) and was detained by police a few days later for “spreading false rumours.” He was even forced to sign a document saying he had “seriously disrupted social order.” Just a week later, Wenliang developed a fever and ultimately passed away in early February from the virus.  The Chinese Communist Party has come under serious fire, and rightly so, for silencing a truth-seeking whistleblower and deliberately covering up what has quickly become a global pandemic. 
On the other hand, the finger-pointing has prompted xenophobic rhetoric on a mass scale: Chinese-owned businesses have arbitrarily suffered, and President Donald Trump has called the coronavirus “the Chinese virus.” Reactions like these put writer Susan Sontag’s saying, “nothing is more punitive than to give a disease a meaning — that meaning being an invariably moralistic one” in a new light. 
We know how corrosive censorship can be, but we are also witnessing the shortcomings of a free press: Unregulated mass media outlets such as CNN profit off of our panic and play into our paranoia, with each click-bait title being more distressing than the last. It has been, and continues to be, a challenge to sift through all the bullshit and parcel out what is a real cause for concern from what is just fear-mongering.
For the record, I’m not trying to draw moral equivalencies between a democracy and an authoritarian regime; rather, I’m acknowledging that a free press and a censored press beget unique problems, which vary in degree. 
The oxymorons don’t end there. We are watching globalization spread and contract, expand its scope and fold in on itself, all at once. Cornerstones of modern consumerism, organized sports and live entertainment have gone silent. Air travel, once tacit and commonplace, has become a hazardous, virus-spreading machine. International supply chains that we took to be infallible have broken down faster than you can say “country-wide lockdown.” Simply put, the fragility of our defining interconnectedness is showing.
Yet the coronavirus outbreak is also a testament to the power of our interdependence. Many of us who are young and know the world to be divided and disparate are witnessing, for the first time ever, the whole planet experience the same thing. We are all coping in synchrony; we are all participating in lauding or criticizing each other’s strategies. Telecommunication allows us to learn from, react to and build upon ideas and each other at unprecedented speeds — at both an individual and state level. 
Yes, many established systems are falling apart in tragic ways — people are losing money and jobs by the thousands, and private healthcare is failing us — but at least the whole world is watching. This involuntary pause has forced us to take a step back and collectively recognize that we were moving too fast, that we need to work toward a more robust, sustainable way of living — one that doesn’t completely crumble at the front end of a pandemic. Our globalized world is fragile yet powerful, severed yet irrevocably bound.
All this is to say that there are dissonances to take note of amid the coronavirus pandemic, ones that are not and should not be easily digestible. 
The way the internet handles issues transforms our experiences with them, not just because of the size of the problem but also because of the scale of our reactions. In general, online culture encourages us to address serious matters like these with a lack of nuance and context; 280-character tweets, quippy Instagram captions and five-minute soundbites rarely succeed in capturing all angles of a given problem. The result, among others, is often extreme takes at the cost of critical thinking. Extremities tend to be well-suited to gross oversimplification and are an enemy to complex, multifaceted issues.
So, I implore all my readers to put their critical thinking hats on and to remember that mass media and online platforms are more conducive to binary answers than they are to the multiple, often multifaceted, realities that define our world. I encourage you to become well-acquainted with Bohr’s idea that the opposite of one profound truth may very well be another profound truth. It may help you better reconcile with the ongoing madness.
For the most part, this issue won’t have easy, cut-and-dry answers ⁠— but that doesn’t mean that there are no answers at all.

It’s official. The coronavirus has burst the USC bubble. Apparently, privilege doesn’t entail virus immunity. Yet scrolling through the countless social media posts mourning students’ easy access to parties, drugs, booze and Coachella, privilege remains a prevalent trait among the student body. It’s downright ridiculous. The pity party had its time and place, but now it’s time to move on.
Yes, everyone was essentially evacuated from campus, leaving belongings, friends and the possibilities of forming new relationships behind. Yes, international students were basically forced to choose between their home countries, their families, and staying in the United States at the cost of being barred from returning. Yes, all classes are going to be online through the semester like a bizarro pro-version of Khan Academy. And yes, the class of 2020 will be receiving their degrees online until the in-person commencement is rescheduled. 
It’s safe to say that no one is happy with how things have turned out. However, the situation unfolding at USC is not unique; the wash-rinse-repeat technique has been adopted at schools and universities across the country. The rest of the academic year didn’t turn out how anyone would have hoped, and complaining about it won’t change anything — it may make it worse. 
Self-pity is an addictive drug — self-victimization even more so. Both pet our egos, feeding into the mindset that the individual is powerless, that everything is out to get us. Many don’t seem to see the bigger picture, as they are lost in aggrandizing the virus as if it had specific intent: targets to take out, karma to enact. The coronavirus has taken from all, not just USC. While all students lost a semester, some people have lost much more: jobs, housing, loved ones. And if you’ve tried grocery shopping recently, you’d know some people seem to have even lost their minds. 
In the United States alone, 18% of workers have reported having their hours docked or lost their jobs completely since the beginning of the outbreak in January. A total of 3 million jobs are estimated to be lost by this summer. The U.S. death toll has exceeded 500 with over 42,000 cases spanning the entire country, and keep in mind that there are many more predicted to be infected who have not, or cannot, seek treatment because of absurd out-of-pocket costs, possible deportation or the fact that there aren’t enough resources available. 
Despite how hopeless this situation may seem, there is much that we can do, even while stuck in the house. Already, people have mobilized on social media for the purpose of providing those in need with food and supplies. The Local USC Moms and Dads On Call Facebook group is working to connect its over 3,000 members with students — in the U.S. and abroad — to provide support during this difficult time. Within the USC student body, Veronica Marks — a junior majoring in screenwriting — has organized a food pantry from evacuated students’ donations. When shopping, take only what’s needed. Resist feeding into the paranoia by buying out the entire supply of this-or-that. Remember, those out in the world with you — even the people fighting old ladies over toilet paper — are human beings too. Treat them as such.
So don’t curse the sky, or cry over lost chances. We must walk the line between hyper-individualization and overgeneralization. That is, don’t try to equivocate everyone’s struggle, though it may stem from a common source. Your pain is not my pain, is not his pain, is not their pain. But don’t minimize what others are experiencing either — this is no time for the “mine-is-bigger-than-yours” game. 
Let us put the power of the so-called “Trojan Family” to the test.

With all the craziness and shelter-in-place directives, it’s easy to forget that it’s an election year, and the Democratic nominee has yet to be officially selected. 
Former Vice President Joe Biden may be winning the votes, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is certainly triumphing when it comes to the ideas. The historically independent senator from Vermont has successfully seized control of the Democratic Party, pushing it way to the left — even farther left than the days when Hillary Clinton was the party leader. 
Take the issue of free public college as an example. Four years ago, this idea was radical and deemed delusional. It’s still just as misguided to implement on a federal level, but virtually every Democratic primary candidate supported it. And that includes “moderates” like Biden. 
In the most recent debate, Biden said he supports a plan to make public universities cost free for families who earn less than $125,000. For context, the median family income in the United States is roughly $63,000. The 75th percentile earns just over $113,000 per year. 
There are several problems with the free public college plan, which is clearly meant to score short-term wins without taking responsibility for any problematic future implications — because another president will have to deal with that. 
The first problem is that the plan assumes that higher education is a federal responsibility. The word “education” appears zero times in the Constitution. There are no federal public colleges. So first and foremost, even if this plan garners extraordinary support, it should be implemented on a state-by-state basis. Taxpayers in Wyoming, Florida and Montana, where in-state tuition is lower than $6,500 should not have to finance state schools that demand three times this amount. 
Second, the plan rewards students with no guarantee that they contribute to the economy or serve the country. It makes complete sense to cut a tuition check to students who commit to serving in the U.S. military. It’s logical to enroll students in loan forgiveness programs when they work in public interest or government jobs. But taxpayers should not have to fund students who have plans to leave the United States and contribute to another country’s economy. It certainly isn’t just to ask taxpayers to sponsor someone’s college tuition if that person later decides not to work at all, not to play a role in the economy and not to contribute to Social Security.  
Does the student in ROTC who serves in the military deserve the same government support as me, a political science major? Now consider the art student who has plans to move to Europe after graduation. A legendary statement from a beloved Democrat comes to mind: “Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.” 
There is no question that equal opportunity is the goal — and yes, it’s far from reality. Private universities in many cases reduce or even waive tuition for low-income families. USC announced this year it will not charge tuition for families of incoming students making less than $80,000. But USC is a private institution and has the luxury of picking and choosing qualified candidates only. 
The federal plan would automatically allow all American families below the median income threshold to qualify, no matter which public college their student attends and what their future plans might be. While families will obviously prefer free money to low-interest loans, the economy cannot — and should not — support that. The only way to ensure government aid is reciprocated is to make sure the loan is repaid, either in service or in dollars.  
Third, and most importantly, the plan doesn’t attack the root cause of the problem: the astronomical cost of college in the first place. Instead of irresponsibly feeding the beast, the government should do what it can to kill the beast, which is to slash college costs instead of pretending they aren’t ridiculous. The number of college lobbyists on Capitol Hill explains why this route isn’t properly being discussed. 
Colleges pay their professors more than decent wages — of course, much is rightfully deserved for the money and prestige they bring to the institution — but many administrators are way overpaid. Federal funding for college completely ignores this reality. 
Sharing is caring, that’s true. It’s certainly a well-intentioned plan to fund every students’ college experience, but sharing requires just that — sharing. There is an implied return on investment, a guarantee that whatever is being shared will be passed forward again. Nobody wants to share with someone who takes and never gives back. But that will be an inevitable reality with a blanket free college plan.
