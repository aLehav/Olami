As Alexis Bard Johnson, along with the rest of her co-workers at USC ONE Archives Collection at the USC Libraries, made the transition to working from home as a result of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home orders to mitigate the spread of coronavirus in public settings, she began to question what the term “safer-at-home” meant for people, particularly within the LGBTQ community and people of color. Looking through the archives collection of LGBTQ images and objects, the curator decided to use her experience as an art historian to contextualize how individuals develop and define safety in their home in their own subjective ways. 
With art exhibitions often developing behind the public eye, unveiled after countless hours of preparation, research and organization, Johnson’s ongoing project is chartering on unknown territory. With weekly posts and commentary available for immediate critique for the general public, Johnson looks to provide an artistic response to the shelter at home orders prompted by the pandemic.
“As a trained art historian, I make sense of the world through history and material culture,” Johnson wrote on the exhibition’s website. “Combining those skills with the resources of the Archives is the best way I can contribute to understanding and contextualizing our present moment and make sense of what we are currently feeling and experiencing.”
Her exhibition “Safer at Home” is an online display of archival materials from the ONE Archives Collection, the world’s largest repository of LGBTQ materials, at the USC Libraries. Using photographs of historical events that mirror modern phenomena, including overrun hospitals caring for coronavirus patients and the ongoing civil unrest regarding police brutality and anti-Blackness, Johnson looks to explore what safety and “home” mean for LGBTQ communities circa 1976 compared to the present.
Initially, Johnson focused on the rhetoric of “safer-at-home” regulations spurred by the pandemic and how LGBTQ people may view safety through the lens of institutional discrimination that was most notably present during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Now, the exhibition strives to be vigilant in responding to significant cultural shifts, such as the recent protests against police brutality and in solidarity of Black lives.
“The fact that we’ve had this huge upsurge of a movement that’s been long going … in the midst of the pandemic, they’re two totally related concepts,” Johnson said. “The project has responded to [the protests]. You’ll see the most recent posts are much more thinking about ending racism, ending sexism [and] defunding the police.” 
As noted on the exhibition’s website, the pandemic and continued police violence and killings have disproportionately Black, brown and transgender individuals. Johnson said she also identifies the inequality evident in both of these global crises as they pertain to the LGBTQ population and people of color, particularly to Black people.  
Along with sharing archives from the collection, Johnson also provides a personal interpretation and commentary each week on a select image depicting moments of anti-sexism and anti-racism activism from the past century while relating it to the protests to end police brutality against LGBTQ and Black people. Her commentary has revolved around how the meanings of home and safety change during crises. 
“In light of recent protests, the phrase also draws attention to the stark privilege of [safer at home],” Johnson writes. “Who’s safety? Who’s home? Safety as defined by whom?”
The exhibition also frames history in a way that critiques institutional failures, unfulfilled promises and discriminatory practices of the past, such as inadequate hospital beds for AIDS patients. For Johnson, the past can provide positive lessons for contemporary global crises. 
“It’s about duration, and if you look at any past protests that have been kind of successful in impacting change [on] policy, they have to be long and sustained,” Johnson said. “I think that’s one of the things that we can learn from history while also acknowledging the failures — the failed promises [and] the failed inclusive practices of the past.”
According to the project’s website, the exhibition will “continue to probe what ‘safer at home’ means in a world shaped by structural racism, classism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.” To counterbalance the limited material available for digital exhibition, Johnson decided to include the voices of queer people of color, contemporary Los Angeles-based artists and their perspective of current events.
In recorded interviews, Johnson discusses the previous works of four artists — Ben Cuevas, MariNaomi, Brenda Zhang (Bz) and Rakeem Cunningham — and how ongoing protests and isolating at home during the pandemic have influenced their artistic thinking.
“These connections between past artists and materials in the Archive and these contemporary artists not only further the dialogue between past and present but underscore the idea that an archive is always in process,” Johnson wrote on the website.
Bz, a visual artist and architectural designer, centers their work on exploring the influence that cultural construction has on physical construction. In response to the recent protests, they identify the physical bodies of militarized police as a product of cultural ideas of safety. The resulting physical environment includes police forces and means of surveillance that further create cultural ideas of safety. Safety then becomes a skewed cultural phenomenon that impacts all communities but has its core beliefs rooted in white, non-Black, cishet and male cultural perceptions of safety, they said. 
“That idea of safety actually hinges on and actively is producing a system of state-sanctioned violence against Black communities and trans communities and making those communities incredibly targeted,” Bz said. 
Bz agreed with Johnson in identifying the recent protests against police brutality as a historic moment that must maintain its momentum to effect tangible change and recognized the necessity for non-Black artists of color, as well as white artists, to commit to doing the work of anti-racism.
“We need to speak out intentionally and thoughtfully, appropriately and without fear, and we need to model it for each other so that we don’t unduly burden Black artists, trans artists and other artists of marginalized identities,” Bz said.
Cuevas, a multimedia artist, said he identifies similarities between the safer-at-home ordinances for the pandemic and the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Recognizing how safety became unclear during both health crises, Cuevas said it further impacted how individuals considered what a home meant for them. 
“It’s not just staying safe in your home, it’s also making home a safe space for yourself,” Cuevas said.
As a queer, nonbinary, HIV-positive artist, he stressed the need for people to develop positive, self-care methods of safety construction to promote healthy living during uncertain times.
Developing safety within the home also requires individuals to ask difficult questions about how to engage in meaningful activism, Cuevas said. People of different ages, races and with different beliefs must each answer the question of where safety is best found for them — staying at home or joining the street protests against police brutality. 
“I think we have to question, you know, safer for who?” Cuevas said. “When gentrification happens places often become safer for people with wealth, white people — people who benefit from a lot of privileges in society … [We can’t just say] a neighborhood changes and more fancy shops and stuff come in and there’s less crime visible in the street [that] it’s automatically safer. You have to think about those crimes in relationship to our criminal justice and policing.”
Placing archival material and contemporary artwork together in the exhibition encourages various perspectives on the pandemic, protests and the meaning of safer at home to develop, Johnson said. The goal of the project is to provide multiple lenses through which to interpret historical moments and better understand the present.
“[Both artwork and archival material] offer glances … into both our present moment and [history],” Johnson said. “At any moment in time, you might think of something different or something new or change your perspective at best. That’s what an exhibition does at its best.”

The U.S. Supreme Court ruling blocking the Trump administration from terminating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program brought feelings of happiness and relief for undocumented students like Luis. Luis, who has been applying for a U visa — set aside for victims of criminal activity against undocumented immigrants — found out about the decision with his family that morning through a text message from an internship mentor. 
The Supreme Court decision was handed down Thursday, after arguments were presented in November last year. Established by the Department of Homeland Security under Barack Obama’s presidential administration, the DACA program stood as an important step to immigration reform by providing undocumented immigrants access to work authorization and government benefits. 
Luis, who is eligible to apply for the DACA program, chose initially not to apply because of advice from his attorney. Instead, his family began applying for a U visa during his sophomore year of high school, a visa the attorney said Luis should receive by the end of his first year of college according to a typical timeline. Yet, after his first year of college, Luis had still not received the visa and had no authorization to work in the United States. 
“My first year finishing in USC, I applied to be an orientation adviser,” said Luis, who asked that his last name not be used for privacy reasons. “I had already made these plans — like I got the job offer — and then they asked me for my work authorization, and I thought they would accommodate and see if they could put me through other forms of payment. That’s when they kind of told me, ‘Oh, you can’t get it because of your status. I just felt really defeated about that.”
However, when Luis decided to apply for DACA after his unsuccessful attempt to work in an on-campus job freshman year, President Donald Trump had repealed the program. Because of his situation, Luis was grateful to hear the results of the Supreme Court’s decision. 
“At first, I was just very anxious, with the uncertainty and the Supreme Court delaying [the decision],” said Luis, a rising junior majoring in political science, who migrated to Thousand Oaks at the age of 6 from Yucatan, Mexico. “I was very hesitant and was not really positive about the situation, seeing that there is a conservative majority within the Supreme Court, so I got excited to hear about it.  I think it’s just going to be opening up new opportunities for me and other people.” 
Along with attempts to limit environmental regulations and to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Trump administration decided to discontinue DACA in September 2017 when acting secretary for the Department of Homeland Security Elaine C. Duke sought to end the program, claiming it was unlawfully implemented by the past administration.
Despite the announcement, challenges arose in the lower courts questioning the legality of the termination and arguing that ending DACA would impact those who are protected by the program with the removal of federal relief. In November 2018, a panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed DACA to continue under the premise that the program’s fate would be determined under the Supreme Court. Following the circuit court decision, DHS appealed the decision to the high court. 
The final outcome in the case Thursday prevented the termination of DACA under the Administrative Procedure Act. On the day of the decision announcement, President Carol Folt penned a tweet in solidarity with DACA students.
However, Jean Reisz, co-director of the Gould School of Law Immigration Clinic, referred to the result of the Supreme Court as a “procedural decision” and said the government will still be able to declare the DACA program illegitimate with reasonable justification.
“I think that one of the important things to do is to not over-celebrate today’s decision because for a lot of the DACAmented community, they are still in this temporary status, which in itself can create a lot of anxiety,” Reisz said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I think that [with] this decision coming at this time, we should really try and harness the momentum.”
In anticipation of the decision, the immigration clinic released an announcement for a live Zoom webinar June 7 on their social media feeds.  The event analyzed the outcome and disseminated information on the available campus resources for students, faculty and staff, including free consultations with legal experts and access to support systems, such as the Office of Religious Life and Student Health Center, which connect undocumented students with resources such as financial aid, housing, counseling and legal support.
The webinar, co-sponsored by the Latinx/Chicanx Center for Advocacy and Student Affairs, Improving Dreams, Equality, Access, and Success at USC and the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration, featured Reisz and other members from the clinic, including staff attorney Jennifer Macias and clinic co-director Niels Frenzen. Although the panelists in the webinar seemed momentarily satisfied with the decision, they warned their audience against seeing it as a guaranteed protection for DREAMers. 
“We know that this decision does not provide any security for DACA recipients,” said Macias during the webinar. “But we need comprehensive immigration reform, rather than this stopgap measure that prevents the deportation of DREAMers.”
For Selene Castillo, a rising sophomore from Guanajuato, Mexico majoring in Spanish and international relations, being undocumented has been a taboo topic since her high school years in Coachella Valley.
“From high school, a lot of kids don’t talk about [being undocumented],” she said. “There’s no club for DACA students, there’s no support or community for us. And now that I think about it, it’s really sad because a majority of the school population, would benefit from [talking about it].” 
In order to qualify for DACA, those who apply must meet certain requirements, including being 15 years of age with no record of felony charges. Upon meeting the age requirement, Castillo applied to DACA and later learned of the various resources including college financial assistance available to her that other undocumented students unable to qualify for DACA would not have access to. 
“Going to USC, it was a burden to apply to financial help being a DACA student,” Castillo said. “And then I know students that were undocumented with absolutely no protection and it’s even harder for them, and it’s like, they’re trying to make a living, they’re trying to educate themselves. They’re trying to become a good asset to this community, and they just don’t have the tools.”
While attending a high school class in September 2017, one of Castillo’s instructors pulled her out of class, informing her of the Trump administration’s decision to phase out DACA, a decision that would limit undocumented students from applying. Although the news came as a shock to her and many of her peers, Castillo considered herself lucky since she had applied to DACA before the discontinuation. 
Even with Thursday’s decision being the best-case scenario for DACA recipients, webinar panelist Macias stressed that new applicants may not be able to apply to DACA since the DHS has not issued any information regarding if non-DACA applicants will still be able to apply.  
“We currently do not know whether there will be new applications for DACA accepted because as of right now, the DACA memorandum can be rescinded again — the only thing that the Trump administration has to do is give valid reasons as to why it’s rescinding DACA,” Macias said.
Even with the future of DACA uncertain, Castillo feels content about the decision from the court and remains optimistic for future immigration reform.
“A lot of it is still uncertain as to how this is going to actually play out,” she said. “But definitely there’s hope. There’s hope, and I think that’s the best feeling at the moment.”
However, Luis, who was also pleased with the decision, said he recognized the need for increased governmental action for undocumented people beyond the Supreme Court’s decision — including a pathway for citizenship and the opportunities for loans and property ownership.
“DACA was never meant to be a long-term solution … With DACA, you just get authorization to work in the U.S., but you don’t get access to other things,” Luis said. “Although they might not come from typical American roots where you’re born here, they grew up here, were immersed in the culture, and this is what they know as home.”
Karen Mendoza, president of IDEAS at USC, an organization advocating for and bringing awareness to issues affecting undocumented students, said that the decision is not a final solution and highlights additional work that needs to be done to support DACA students. 
“It’s still only a Band-Aid to the broader issue,” Mendoza said. “A lot of student organizations on campus are echoing the same message, which is that Congress needs to act, and they need to act now. DACA remains a temporary fix to a long-standing issue.”
Originally, IDEAS predicted the decision would result in DACA’s termination and prepared to support students in need after the decision’s announcement. They worked with the Gould Immigration Clinic and senior director of Student Equity and Inclusion Programs Naddia Palacios to give students virtual support through a Zoom session.  
“For our program, we were going to have a Zoom centered around helping our students cope with the anxiety and devastation that would come with the termination of DACA, so our whole entire program was different,” Mendoza said. “Right after the decision on Thursday, we were going to have meetings all night and on Friday, we were going to offer our students support, but that didn’t happen, so it was a more calm and relieving Thursday.”
Moving forward, IDEAS looks to continue advocating for immigration reform on campus by working with administrators to improve awareness of issues undocumented students face, as well as pushing for an on-campus resource center for undocumented students. 
“There are a lot of things on campus that undocumented Trojans struggle with,” Mendoza said. “We don’t have access to a lot of things, like teachers who are informed of our status, and sometimes, we need extra support that a lot of people don’t need if they’re citizens, so we were really pushing for that. The next step is to let our allies know that although DACA was saved, DREAMers are not entirely satisfied. We will not stop fighting until we have a clean pathway to citizenship … We are far from immigration reform, but this win will help keep us motivated to continue.”

Instead of looking out the window of his new office in Waite Phillips Hall, incoming Rossier School of Education dean Pedro Noguera looks at the windows of Zoom calls on his computer screen. His days are full of virtual meetings rather than ones he can stroll to on the 229-acre University Park Campus, normally full of students whizzing by on bikes or eating lunch on McCarthy Quad. 
When Noguera isn’t on Zoom, he and his spouse are homeschooling their 8-year-old daughter, making home-cooked meals or working on a podcast with longtime friends. Despite the coronavirus pandemic imposing changes to his personal and professional life, Noguera is making the most of his circumstances to prepare to take office across town by transitioning his projects at UCLA — calling attention to student homelessness and the school-to-prison pipeline — while learning the ropes of USC and coming up with solutions to safely bring students back to campus. Although the transition has proven to be challenging, one silver lining in working remotely is that there is no traffic, Noguera said.  
“My work-from-home experience is probably just like everybody else’s,” Noguera said. “Both my wife and I work from home, and we keep [our daughter] busy with work and do things with her, but there are a lot of Zoom meetings.”
UCLA professor of education Tyrone Howard, one of Noguera’s friends involved in the education podcast focused on the effects social and economic conditions may have on schools, can attest to both Noguera’s lighthearted personality and his tireless work ethic. Twenty years prior, a nervous Howard approached Noguera at an American Educational Research Association conference to express his admiration for Noguera’s work. After Noguera’s warm response, the two have stayed in touch since then and now work together at UCLA, where Howard has witnessed Noguera’s growth throughout his career as an educator, researcher and leader. 
“He is, in many people’s eyes, the foremost thinker on issues tied to education today,” Howard said. “He is someone who’s deeply committed to equity and access in schools for all children, someone who’s a tireless advocate for marginalized, Black, brown, poor children. He’s well respected internationally. He’s a consensus builder … He’s a visionary but he doesn’t stay at the visionary stage. He puts in the time to execute plans of action to help those ideas come to fruition.” 
After more than 30 years working in education — from professorships at prestigious institutions, including Harvard University and New York University, to teaching at public schools in Rhode Island and California — Noguera will join USC July 1 as the Rossier dean. Drawing from his personal experience as a student, teacher and researcher, Noguera looks to solve inequalities in classrooms by advancing scholarship that not only examines the social causes of these gaps but also enacts solutions to close them.
Coming into his own 
Coming from a working class family, Noguera knew the importance of education but never thought he’d work in it.
A New York native, Noguera’s parents did not graduate high school. As a first-generation college student at Brown University, Pedro Noguera earned his bachelor’s degrees in sociology and American history, later completing a master’s degree in sociology from Brown University and a doctorate in sociology from the University of California, Berkeley. However, his academic accomplishments came with obstacles along the way. 
“As an undergrad, the main issues were feeling as though I didn’t fit in, feeling as though I didn’t fully belong,” Noguera said. “Over time, even during my first year, I started to feel more comfortable. I started to see how my background provides me with strength like knowing how to work hard and deal with people, so I was able to overcome my feelings of intimidation.”
Fortunately, he found a mentor, sociologist Martin Martel, who appreciated his tenacity for asking questions in class. Noguera often joined Martel during his office hours to read advanced sociology material. Martel helped Noguera turn adversity into opportunity by notifying him of grants and scholarships and encouraging him to pursue graduate studies in sociology. 
“So many times, especially for first generation college students, college is a big mystery, like what opportunities are available for funding, but he played that role [as a mentor] and then encouraged me to apply to graduate school,” Noguera said.
As an undergraduate student, Noguera also earned his teaching credential in social studies to fall back on teaching jobs, though he didn’t intend to pursue a career in education at the time. Later, as a doctoral student studying sociology at UC Berkeley, Noguera became a substitute teacher for public schools in Oakland, where he lived in a storefront apartment. As he spent more time in K-12 education, he found a connection between his studies in sociology and education.
“I thought substitute teaching was a very good way to learn about the community that I was living in,” Noguera said. “It was also a great way to do something that I felt was practical and impactful. Grad school didn’t feel like that at all, at times it felt very alienating. Being in schools and teaching had the opposite effect.”
Despite having taught thousands of students from preschool through high school, there is one student Noguera will never forget. While a professor of education at UC Berkeley, Noguera volunteered to teach at a continuation school for students who had been expelled from their original schools. One day, one of the students showed Noguera and the principal his car. The trunk was filled with weapons. 
“I had a student who was kind of a leader among his peers and who was very smart, but he was involved in some criminal activity,” Noguera said. “And one day, he came to see me and the principal and told us that he had been shot at and that his brother’s been hit by bullets, and that he wanted to get revenge … He was going to go and get the people who shot them.”
The principal and Noguera spent several hours explaining to the student why retaliation was not the best course of action. Afterwards, they realized that if the student did not retaliate, he would likely face more danger. From there, they helped the student enroll into the military. 
“The irony was, he’d be safer in the military, even at a time when we were going to war — the first Iraq War — than he would be living on the streets of Oakland,” Noguera said. “Those were the kind of difficult issues that many of our students were dealing with. To be a teacher in that context meant you had to deal with those issues, you couldn’t just tell a student to be safe, you had to understand what contributed to their lack of safety.”
These experiences not only motivated Noguera’s research on equity in education but it also helped him in his role as an educator to not only deal with issues concerning student safety but also understanding the factors contributing to that lack of safety. 
“It reinforced my sense that for schools to make a difference for kids, schools have to understand what was happening in the lives of kids, they had to be responsive to their needs,” Noguera said. “And to the degree that they could do that, then schools could become powerful.” 
A journey in academia 
Noguera began his career in academia at UC Berkeley as a professor of education and director of the Institute for the Study of Social Change. From there, he became a professor of communities and schools at Harvard University before accepting a position as a professor of education at New York University, where he also served as executive director of the Metropolitan Center for Research on Equity and Transformation of Schools. 
When then-Harvard professor of education Suárez-Orozco was giving guest lectures at UC Berkeley, he was asked by a Harvard committee to look into recruiting Noguera, teaching at UC Berkeley at the time, to join the Harvard education faculty. From there, the two colleagues would continue to work together at Harvard, New York University and UCLA.
“At UCLA, he’s been an exemplary citizen of the university, willing to step in, roll up his sleeves and get to work,  Suárez-Orozco said. “He’s a fine, fine teacher. He has been a trusted friend in the long run … The word we use in Brooklyn, New York is he’s an all purpose mensch … it’s a very New York term for a very wonderful person.” 
Later, after joining UCLA’s faculty as a professor at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies in 2015, Noguera founded UCLA’s Center for the Transformation of Schools, an education research center of UCLA professors and doctoral students primarily dedicated to studying the effect of the school-to-prison pipeline on Black students. From his experiences growing up, Noguera was determined to help marginalized students in his career.
Through the center, Noguera led his team in conducting case studies on funding distribution, social and emotional learning and new discipline policies for school districts including the Pomona Unified School District and the San Diego Unified School District. Noguera’s successor as director of the center, Howard, who witnessed the impact of Noguera’s research on policy. However, the center’s work doesn’t end at the district level.  
One policy recommendation Noguera has championed is the adoption of restorative practices in school districts. In an effort to reduce student suspensions, discipline policies have altered from banning students from attending school to instead keeping them in school. The time wasted by going home and learning nothing is used for students to take responsibility and repair relationships with peers and staff, addressing behavioral problems directly rather than hoping that students will change their behavior by themselves. 
“Research can sometimes be helpful in provoking change,” Noguera said. “For example, we released a study on homeless students in California [where we] wanted to really show how so many kids were rendered invisible because no one was even aware that they were homeless, and a lot of times, those kids don’t have adequate services. So, doing work like that is a way to draw attention to problems.”
Adapting to crisis
The search process for a new Rossier dean began in August, with hundreds of candidates applying to the position. From his experience as a teacher in addition to his membership of various school boards and board of trustees and advising government officials on school system policies, Noguera seemed like the perfect choice. 
“He’s a world-class scholar … Not only does he do work at the highest level of pure scholarship, but he also has a tremendous understanding and impact in practice,” said John Matsusaka, Marshall School of Business professor and executive director of the Initiative and Referendum Institute. “He’s really an electrifying candidate for a school that’s been at state leadership for 20 years. It’s going to be fantastic to see what energy he brings on the next page.”
With the possibility of classes continuing online in some form in the fall, Julia Marsh, a professor of education at Rossier and one of several faculty members on the search committee for the dean position, said Noguera may face technical challenges coming into the position during the coronavirus pandemic, such as balancing the Rossier budget or phasing students into campus physically. However, she remains optimistic that he will be able to overcome the obstacles with his experience. 
“[It’s] a difficult time for someone to come on and take on leadership in a new way,” Marsh said. “I think he brings skills and experience that can lead us during this difficult time … You can tell that he’s someone who values relationships, human capital and building values. People [at Rossier] are really excited about him coming.” 
As a frequent adviser to the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District since his time at UCLA, Noguera also said that Rossier should act as a thought partner for school systems and strengthen the relationship between USC and the local community. As primary and secondary schools approach the challenge of reopening while maintaining modifications for social distancing, Noguera intends for Rossier to be an ally to local schools by using the school’s research capabilities and implementing programs.
“[The pandemic] has exposed our inequities in societies — there are so many families that are struggling now financially … that weighs on me,” Noguera said. “But on top of that, from an education standpoint, we know there are a lot of kids who haven’t been able to participate in distance learning because they don’t have internet access.”
While school systems could not have foreseen the necessity for remote learning, Noguera said he believes more progress should be made to ensure that students are offered a stimulating environment similar to what they would have had in an in-person classroom — starting with providing internet access for students in need. 
“We should first of all acknowledge that there were problems with the way we were doing things, especially in education before, and this should give us a chance to do things differently,” Noguera said. “I would like to see Rossier become a leading center for innovation in education where people could get support in thinking through these new approaches.”
Though the future of education at USC is uncertain due to the pandemic, Howard, Marsh, Matsusaka and Suárez-Orozco said they are certain about Noguera’s capabilities to lead Rossier moving forward. 
“I’m excited about the potential collaboration between USC and UCLA,” Howard said. “I think there’s always room for that. I think his being [at USC], that’s only going to be a win for Los Angeles schools, children and families.”

Last Wednesday, graduate track and field hurdler and sprinter Anna Cockrell took to Twitter to announce the formation of the first Black student-athlete association in USC’s history.“Black athletes will not be silent, and @USC_Athletics needs to change,” Cockrell wrote.Hours after she announced the organization, athletic director Mike Bohn released a statement outlining the formation of the USC Athletics Black Lives Matter Action Team, a historic step by the USC Athletic Department spurred by the Black athletes who penned the letter.“The charge of this group will be to lead our program through a process of continued listening, learning, and educating with the ultimate goal of developing a series of meaningful and substantive actions and reforms for implementation,” Bohn’s statement read.Black athletes first brought the conversation to the Athletic Department on May 31. Five days after Black Lives Matter protests erupted across the country over the killing of George Floyd, Cockrell hosted a Zoom town hall to allow athletes to air out grievances and stand against racial injustice both within the University and in their respective communities.“I think the key takeaway is that no matter how insulated we think USC might be from these issues, that the reality is racism permeates, honestly, every facet of American life and the Black American experience,” Cockrell said.Student-athletes shared what they had done at local protests and expressed different methods of activism they could bring to USC. The ultimate consensus was the need for an independent, student-led organization that collectively addressed the University on behalf of Black student-athletes.Over a period of 17 days, members held multiple private calls to discuss what issues within USC Athletics needed to be addressed. Early department statements regarding the protests did not explicitly use the phrase or hashtag “Black Lives Matter,” which was important for members of the developing organization.“There was some contentiousness over specific posts that didn’t address anything specifically or anything of concern, like George Floyd’s murder, all the other murders and deaths and police brutality,” women’s volleyball junior opposite hitter Candice Denny said. “It was more so about ‘we fight on together.’ While I understand the sentiment, at the same time, this is something much further than that. And if you want to actually support us, it’s going to take a lot more than that.”Cockrell and other leading members are keeping the exact number and names of participants confidential to honor the safe space the organization provides for Black student-athletes. However, the core members span multiple sports and classes and include Black University employees such as associate professor of clinical education Alan Green and track and field director Caryl Smith Gilbert.The final product of the two-week deliberation period was a four-page letter to the USC athletic administration and Bohn. The organization’s name was officially announced as the United Black Student-Athletes Association.UBSAA listed 12 issues and initiatives that demanded a broad array of action from the Athletic Department, University and fans and alumni.“The goal is that all are going to be addressed, and I think that’s why they weren’t numbered,” Cockrell said. “They’re of equal importance, honestly.”Of the 12 initiatives, the “promise of no retaliation for public statements” relating to the protests or racial injustice had one of the most in-depth explanations by the organization.The NCAA has a long, contentious history with student-athlete contracts, and one of the main controversies has been its control over athletes’ images and social media rights. All USC athletes must sign a social media use contract when they arrive on campus, and its blanket legal language can make the legitimacy of political involvement murky.The weight of professional athletes’ prior activism and ensuing backlash has also discouraged student-athletes from speaking out. Multiple USC athletes cited Colin Kaepernick’s ousting from the NFL because of his police brutality protest as a precedent for the sports community’s reaction to activism and as a cause for intimidation.“He stood out in racial injustice four years ago and he was blackballed out of the NFL,” football junior tailback Ben Easington said. “So from an NCAA football player standpoint that does all the right things — He gets good grades, he’s a 3.0-above guy, he goes to all the classes, he’s in the playing field, he’s graded high on [Pro Football Focus] — and say he takes a knee … All of the work he has done up to [that point] is not gonna help him.”UBSAA also outlined the need for the Athletic Department staff to reflect the athletes they work with by considering Black candidates for open jobs. The Sports Psychology department does not have any Black psychologists on staff, and Athletic Medicine has only one Black staff member, according to UBSAA’s statement.Discrepancy in an Athletic Department’s diversity compared to the student-athlete makeup of universities is a nationwide phenomenon. According to the NCAA Race and Gender Demographics database, approximately 20% of Division I athletes in the 2019-20 school year were Black, while just 10% of coaches and Athletic Department administrators were Black.UBSAA’s demands do not solely apply to the improvement of the Black student-athlete experience. The organization also calls for scholarships for Black students who do not participate in athletics or have exhausted their NCAA eligibility. For a college system that sees a glaring gap in the number of Black student-athletes that compete compared to the number who walk across the stage at graduation, this can allow the financial means for many to finish their degree and proceed to higher education, Denny said.“Our value extends far past our athletic eligibility,” Denny said. “That’s one of my favorite points because once our eligibility is exhausted, we’re out looking for graduate endowments and scholarships to help USC Black athletes and students further education, go to grad school, pursue Ph.D.s and the highest levels of education, and I think we can all benefit from that.”Beyond the letter to the Athletic Department, UBSAA has also created an Instagram account and is planning to become a recognized student organization this semester. According to football junior offensive lineman Jalen McKenzie, the organization hopes to reach beyond the campus and effect change in the South Central community as well.“The community that USC is in is a large community of people of color, Black people,” McKenzie said. “USC being a predominantly white institution — it’s like its own little world, little bubble. So I think that speaks to a lot of athletes’ experiences, and that’s kind of the space that our organization is trying to create.”The public nature of UBSAA’s mission and demands on social media is intended to act as accountability for the Athletic Department’s future action — or inaction. The Athletic Department has not provided any updates beyond Bohn’s announcement of the USC Athletics Black Lives Matter Action Team. However, coaches and administrators have kept in touch with the core members of UBSAA frequently as discussions of returning to campus grow more pressing.“Once a brand has posted something like that, I want them to know that I will hold them accountable,” Denny said. “I have the screenshots, I have the receipts.”When discussing the new organization, UBSAA organizers shared a common sentiment: that this is just the beginning.“Any fear or anxiety that I have is mitigated by the fact that it’s not about me, because it’s not,” Cockrell said. “It’s really about the organization and making things better for all Black student-athletes who come through USC. I’m personally not afraid.”
Wednesday, June 24 at 12:04 p.m.: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Anna Cockrell is a former track and field athlete. She is returning to the team in the spring as a graduate student. The article has been updated online to reflect the accurate information. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Juneteenth has always been a date worth celebrating in the United States. To uplift and honor the holiday, the SCA African American Cinema Society hosted a live Q&A session Monday night with alumni and the creators behind “Miss Juneteenth.” During the event, writer and director Channing Godfrey Peoples and producer Neil Creque Williams discussed current events and what the making of the film meant to them at such a pivotal moment in our nation’s civil rights history. 
The event was moderated by Luke Harris, a rising junior majoring in film and television production and co-president of AACS. Harris spent time analyzing various cinematic elements of the film, including Peoples’ and Williams’ choices for production and sound design, along with central themes in the narrative and conceptualization of characters. 
“Miss Juneteenth” is a compelling, soulful and emotional story. Turquoise Jones (Nicole Beharie) is a single mother to a rebellious and free-spirited teenage daughter, Kai (Alexis Chikaeze), who she tries to prepare for the Miss Juneteenth pageant in Fort Worth, Texas. The pageant features young African American women vying for a college scholarship. 
A former beauty queen herself, Turquoise was crowned Miss Juneteenth in the 2004 pageant, a title which honors when enslaved people in Texas were told they had been free for two and a half years on June 19, 1865. But Turquoise’s life didn’t turn out as expected by her winning title. As a result, she is determined to rectify the past and in doing so, prepare her daughter to win the local Miss Juneteenth pageant, even if Kai isn’t interested.
When asked about the development of the story for “Miss Juneteenth,” Peoples replied that growing up in Texas, Juneteenth was always an important date. She explained how it was a celebration that was always in the fabric of her life and is a reverent time to remember ancestors. 
The pageant was a formative event for Peoples, as it’s had a lasting influence on her as a writer and director. 
“I got to see all these beautiful, talented, intelligent women that looked like me,” Peoples said. 
When Peoples was first beginning to generate ideas for a feature film, she expressed to Harris how she wanted to write a story about a Black woman who has a dream deferred and who discovers a new dream in the process. From there, Peoples’ inspiration and idea for the film was created. 
With the ongoing nationwide protests in support of Black lives and against police brutality, Peoples noted that they served as a catalyst for her to complete her work. 
“It’s been hard for me to navigate being entirely focused on getting a film out into the world when these tragedies are happening right now,”Peoples said. “For Black people right now, it’s about our survival … I felt more of a sense of determination to get [the film] out into the world, especially after these tragedies happened.” 
At a time when Black voices are increasingly getting the recognition they deserve, Peoples said she hopes that “Miss Juneteenth” will become one of those voices. 
“Our film is very much about the humanity of Black life,” Peoples said. “Who better to tell our stories than from our perspectives as Black people?” 
With this film coming out at such a pivotal time in the fight against social injustice, Williams sees “Miss Juneteenth” taking on a more meaningful role in revealing the larger issue of institutional racism in the United States. 
“It was exciting that the film was coming out but extremely bittersweet that it took not only the pandemic but also the George Floyd situation, the protests and everything for there to be a moment to reflect on some of the bigger dynamics of racism in the country,” Williams said.
“Miss Juneteenth” is not only aesthetically distinctive in its setting but is also detailed and purposeful in its choice of locations and props. Each scene was filmed at a real location in Fort Worth. For example, the juke joint used in the film was a place always known to locals to be open and only closed on their own time. When Peoples and Williams were filming there, local residents were waiting in line to go inside. 
The duo expressed how wonderful the community support was in Fort Worth when production was underway. In their eyes, the community was willing to help them create the authentic, nuanced world they wanted for the film. They were able to use the town’s bars and were given permission to record parts of the Fourth of July parade held yearly to use in the film. 
As the evening progressed, Harris inquired about the role Peoples and Williams believe movies play in education and how such was cultivated in “Miss Juneteenth.” Peoples remarked that this was the very reason she and Williams first bonded during their time at USC. Their shared interest in making films that highlight historical moments in the African American community from a different perspective has stayed with them since those early days. 
The powerful opening of the film begins with the song “Lift Every Voice and Sing” by Shirley Pace and a scene of Turquoise placing the Miss Juneteenth tiara on her head and holding her dress, which then cuts to Turquoise scrubbing a toilet. Beginning the film in this way shows the depth and unique narrative of Turquoise’s character and why she pushes her daughter the way she does. It gives audiences an intimate look into who Turquoise is underneath the crown. 
“That [song] is the Black national anthem,” Peoples said. “For us, it’s our sense of reverence and respect. It’s a moment of reflection for our ancestors. In the lyrics [of the song] it talks about the past and the future and that’s something that Turquoise is navigating in the space of the film.”
Before closing the Q&A portion with Harris, Williams acknowledged that two fellow alumni also worked on the film; Emily Rice, who worked as the composer, and Satomi Martin, who was the first assistant director. 
Sade Famuyiwa, a rising junior majoring in cinema and media studies, shared her love for the film’s aesthetic and asked why Turquoise’s background wasn’t explicitly stated as Famuyiwa felt it was told more subtly as the film progressed. 
“I wanted us to go on that same journey with [Turquoise] in the sense that I didn’t want us to get bogged down in what her back story was and to look at the film for where she is now and where she needed to go,” Peoples said. 
When asked what were the biggest lessons they’ve learned through this film and if they had any tips for young filmmakers, Williams remarked about the importance of adapting and the ability to change approaches when necessary.
“What I had to learn personally was not to get too locked down in just one way of solving a problem or approaching a scene because you may get everything together and it all changes,” Williams said. 
As a writer and director, Peoples’ parting advice emphasized the importance of doing research and conveying the vision for the film to other creatives on set. During the Q&A, Peoples showed one of the binders she used that was full of visual inspiration to help communicate to the creatives the tone of the film.

A mystery more than 87 years in the making has returned to the small screen hoping to unravel the character at its core.
HBO’s limited miniseries “Perry Mason” debuted Sunday and is the fourth television iteration of Erlie Stanley Gardner’s detective fiction novels first published in 1933. A crime has been committed, and downtrodden private investigator Perry Mason’s hope for the world is fading into a Depression-era Los Angeles filled with greed, excess and evil. Despite this pessimistic outlook, Mason is drawn into a kidnapping case plaguing the city with its shocking depravity. 
In the limited series’ premiere episode, “Chapter One,” a sprawling eight-episode story begins to take shape. Set in 1931, at the height of the Great Depression, L.A. stands as the lone center of excess in a nation rocked by economic hardship. The city is largely protected by its prosperous film industry, a boom in oil production and upcoming role as the host city for the 1932 Summer Olympics. But despite the city’s secure financial footing, it is morally bankrupt. 
The episode opens with a thrilling sequence depicting the kidnapping that catalyzes the events of the story. Establishing the events and likely clues that will resurface later in the series, the opening also introduces the Dodson family. Charlie Dodson, the kidnapped baby, is seemingly returned to his parents, Matthew (Nate Corddry) and Emily (Gayle Rankin). The scene concludes with both parents discovering their child dead. After the opening unequivocally sets the tone for a “not your grandfather’s ‘Perry Mason,’” the titular character (Matthew Rhys) and his partner Pete Strickland (Shea Whigham) help to expose the seedy underbelly of 1930s L.A. 
Necessary for the opening episode, an impressive array of actors smoothly and quickly interact with each other throughout the scenes. The errand-like nature of the first episode would usually seem dry and at times is, but it’s improved by the natural way the characters interact. 
The series was originally conceived with Robert Downey Jr. in the nominal role, and thankfully Rhys eschews Downey Jr.’s glibness for a sufficiently damaged and unsmiling performance that calls back to the character’s past traumas as a World War I veteran and a father separated from his 9-year-old son. Veronica Falcón is far and away the standout of the episode in her two scenes as Lupe, Mason’s lover and the manager of the airstrip adjacent to the Mason family dairy farm. Lupe adds levity and humanity to the detective, and she would be vastly underused if her only role is as the “on-and-off” lover from next door. 
The best part of the episode and what looks to be the remainder of the series is the show’s technical quality. Director Tim Van Patten grounds the episode in its tone with a neo-noir direction reminiscent of “True Detective,” or even lighter shows such as “Veronica Mars.” Employing interesting angles, Van Patten often frames Mason in a manner that complements the simplistic written narrative of Mason as a “man against the world.” Production design also works in the show’s favor; the $75 million budget is evident in the total re-creation of 1930s L.A. 
As an HBO premiere episode, Perry Mason largely works. The mood, characters and mystery are established, hooking viewers for the rest of the season. But as a series attempting to break new ground, Perry Mason falls flat — so far. Updating the classic source material by adding mature content and throwing a sheen of money on it is not enough to differentiate the series from the slew of existing ones that center on a man fighting against a world in which “everybody’s got an angle, and everybody’s guilty,” as Mason  describes it.

Since the 2017 release of her first single, “Happy Again,” USC alumna and self-described bedroom R&B artist UMI, born Tierra Umi Wilson, rose to popularity as a genre-bending pioneer of lo-fi electronics and R&B. With multiple hit singles, including “Remember Me,” UMI establishes herself as more than just a vocal artist, pairing her unique sonic style with aesthetically imaginative, often self-directed video visualizers on her YouTube channel. Over the past few years, she’s garnered a following of more than 3 million monthly listeners on Spotify.
Her fourth EP, “Introspection,” becomes another masterpiece to add to her growing discography. Vulnerable and intricate, yet smooth and ambient, the six-song record allows listeners to peek into the candid inner workings of her mind in all its complexity, contemplation, hope and self-doubt.  
UMI shares the details of her artistic exploration of the human condition in a 15-minute YouTube video titled “Introspection [The Film].” In it, she thoughtfully notes, “I’m the main character in my own story but a background character in other people’s,” and proceeds to feature each track through the eyes of different “main characters” at the same house party. “I call it introspection.” 
Complete with a dark, smoky video visualizer, the EP’s title and opening track “Introspection” speaks to UMI’s fear of fully exposing her inner self and the resulting sense of detachment in her relationships. Echoing, distorted vocals and heavy, hazy synths pair seamlessly with lyrics such as “Wish the thoughts would go away / floatin’ farther away” and “Your pretty curls hide your pretty pearls” that might reflect a deeper frustration of putting up a facade for people who may never fully understand her thoughts. “Introspection” is a strong opening to the EP; its explicit vulnerability and somber, captivating melody is custom-made to be the socially anxious overthinker’s anthem.
Similar musical and lyrical themes are found throughout the record. With smooth, glassy vocals and cool, dense acoustic riffs, the next track, “Open Up,” addresses a melancholy farewell and apology to a romantic relationship damaged by her emotional guardedness. UMI’s ethereal, angelic vocals through the second verse are exceptionally electrifying in this gorgeously landscaped song. 
While maintaining a slow, weighty sound, UMI strays from regret and declares freedom in “Where I Wander.” Over a relaxed, echoed synth and bass-heavy beat, her siren-like vocals call her to set herself free from a toxic relationship: “No need to keep fighting what you’re dealt … You were given options where to sail.” While dealing with more serious themes, this song’s energy is relatively low and difficult to catch onto compared to the previous two tracks.
Meanwhile, the second half of the EP transitions into lighter, more hopeful themes. The fourth track, “Bet,” is a dramatic shift in tone as UMI boldly cuts ties with a destructive, one-sided romantic relationship. Carrying a similar tone as her 2017 single “FRIENDZONE,” UMI swaps her typical muted electronic synths for a more traditional R&B sound as she calls her ex-partner out for their dishonesty, failure to commit and “clown shit,” making for a brutally spectacular breakup anthem.
On the other hand, “Pretty Girl hi!” taps into a lighter, floating synth and conveys the feeling of giddy hope when falling in love. While addressing a similar theme as “Love Affair” from her third EP “Love Language,” UMI’s intentions have clearly evolved, as she now pays closer attention to the little details of love rather than the mission of achieving it. As she excitedly lists out hopes for her future with this lover, the bubbly optimism to “Dance in just our baggy jeans” is sure to put a familiar fluttering in any listener’s stomach. 
The final track, “Broken Bottle,” ultimately showcases UMI’s reflection on and acceptance of both her and her partner’s shortcomings in a failed relationship. With soft piano themes and rapid, celestial synth scales, it might be one of the most expertly crafted instrumentals in the entire EP. Lyrically, it delivers a resolution of forgiveness for all “broken bottles” that had been created in the relationship. As she admits, “Crazy I was a mess / Crazy you were so hollow” and “I did not get to say, to you / That I did have somethin’ to say / Forgive you’re from the ways, my dude.” With these lines, UMI suggests that perhaps the true ability to release emotional trauma stems from absolution and self-reflection.
A gifted artist in multiple respects, UMI proves through “Introspection” that she can deliver more than notable singles. Her relatable and humanizing self-reflection — paired with an impressive artistic intuition for cohesion, filmmaking, instrumentals and lyrics — undoubtedly shine through on this release, making a perfect late-night R&B soundtrack and captivatingly provocative film. “Introspection” is not only a fantastic listen but also an impressive career landmark of a noteworthy artist that listeners everywhere should keep their eye on.

After weeks of protests spanning the globe in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, USC, along with other institutions, has received public pressure to reexamine its more-than-centurylong complacency in systemic racism and inequality. As the school hopefully ascends into a new era in which it actively looks to support marginalized students, it is essential to address one of the starkest examples of disparity within the college community: unpaid internships. 
Although USC has scholarship programs to support students who cannot afford to take an unpaid internship, these funds are awarded to an extremely small pool of applicants and offer only a small stipend that is insufficient for students looking to support themselves. To better address the issues of unpaid internships, USC needs to expand these programs to more students and increase the stipend. 
While abolishing unpaid internships would eradicate this inequality, it’s unlikely to happen anytime soon. Keeping that in mind, a way to bridge this gap is for institutions like USC to offer resources that allow students, regardless of socioeconomic status, to build their resumes and skills. 
The Economic Policy Institute reported in 2019 that white families have a median household wealth 12 times higher than that of Black families. This discrepancy is the result of centuries of discriminatory practices, such as redlining, that have prevented Black families from accumulating wealth. 
Redlining was a practice that began in the 1930s in which banks denied loans to people of color in an effort to stop them from buying homes in predominantly white and wealthy neighborhoods. Home ownership is a passive way to accumulate wealth over generations and these practices put people of color, Black people in particular, at a severe disadvantage when it came to increasing household wealth — the very wealth needed to subsidize a student working all summer for an internship that pays nothing. 
An unpaid internship may offer a student needed job experience, but it assumes the student does not need to prioritize earning an income, thereby reinforcing centuries of inequality and discrimination that disproportionately benefit white families. As a result of these discriminatory practices, affluent students benefit from the current system at the expense of others. 
Considering that around half of all graduating seniors participate in an unpaid internship, there is no doubt that work without pay is not only common for college students but somewhat expected. 
Unpaid internships offer students an opportunity to learn and refine their skills as they bolster their resume. This gives students who can complete unpaid internships a leg up in the competitive college environment. According to a survey by ProPublica, 60% of employers preferred to hire applicants with internships on their resume.
For students in fields like journalism, nonprofits or political science, unpaid internships are particularly common, presenting the dilemma between a retail job that pays or an unpaid internship that looks impressive on a resume.
In turn, predominately white, affluent families that can afford unpaid internships often benefit long-term by securing jobs post-graduation over other students — particularly students of color, who often could not afford to work for free — further perpetuating a cycle of inequality. 
In response to this problem, USC has offered scholarships to allow students to pursue unpaid internships. The USC Dreams Dollars Scholarship offers $1,500 to a few outstanding students who have secured nonprofit or government unpaid internships for the summer. In 2018, however, this scholarship was awarded to only 10 students, hardly making it an accessible or realistic option for many students. In fact, in 11 years, just 115 Trojans have received this scholarship.
USC has an undergraduate population of 20,500 students — 4.9% of whom fall in the bottom 20% of the tax bracket, equating to just over 1,000 students from families who make less than $20,000 each year. If even one-tenth of these students wished to secure an unpaid internship over the summer, they could not comfortably do so, given the probability they will not receive the scholarship. 
Additionally, USC offers a scholarship that awards $2,000 to first-generation college students. A $2,000 stipend equates to $5 an hour for an internship that lasts 10 weeks for 40 hours a week. 
These scholarships are a step in the right direction, but they do not address the full scope of inequalities reinforced by unpaid internships in the most meaningful or supportive way. Awarding $1,500 and $2,000 is a start, but it’s not enough for students who rely on the stipend for housing, food and other expenses over the summer. In an effort to combat systemic inequalities, not only should USC award more students with scholarships for unpaid internships, but it also must increase the funding for each.

Considering the exorbitant cost of the 2020-21 school year — $59,260 — and the crushing economic impact of the coronavirus, USC should change its transfer credit policy to allow Trojans to take courses at a community college during the year so they can graduate on time without being forced into a financial bind.
Half of U.S. college students have reported that they can no longer afford their college tuition in the face of the pandemic. The unemployment rate in the United States is the worst it has been in nearly 100 years. Many people have likely used their savings, which may have otherwise gone to tuition, to cover emergency expenses in the wake of the pandemic. Alternatively, parents using an investment portfolio to pay for college may have seen those accounts decimated as the stock market collapsed almost overnight. The bottom line is that paying for college in the coming years is going to be tough for many families. 
Currently, USC students can only take coursework outside of the University during the summer. Any credits taken in the fall, winter or spring are rejected. Additionally, all general education courses must be taken at the University, limiting options for students looking to complete a four-year college education amid financial turbulence. In light of the coronavirus pandemic, this policy is categorically unfair and exploitative. If students cannot afford fall or spring tuition, then they may have no option but to take the semester off — or worse, drop out. Taking courses in the summer cannot make up for this lost time. Thus, many students must delay or deny the completion of their education, which in turn impacts their careers and potential income. 
Community college is an incredibly attractive option right now to many students for many reasons. One can live at home (read: reduce risk by not living in a shared apartment/dorm), avoid travel and — most importantly — pay a reduced cost for classes. 
Take, for instance, a student who decides to take courses in the fall and spring at Santa Monica College rather than at USC: According to the articulation agreement between USC and SMC, the community college offers dozens of courses that are equivalent to USC courses. 
That being said, the cost of tuition for SMC students is significantly lower compared to the University’s. For California residents, SMC costs $46 per unit — a 16-unit semester comes out to $768. For out-of-state students, the cost is a little bit higher, with a $300 nonresident fee added to each unit — still, though, a 16-unit semester comes out to only $5,568. USC, on the other hand, costs $1,995 per unit, a whopping price that is insidiously “subject to change without notice.”  
Or, USC can try a dual-enrollment program, like the University of Oregon’s. Allowing students to take classes at a community college and the University simultaneously could be a good compromise. 
Transfer students can count up to 64 units of schoolwork, or four 16-unit semesters, toward their USC degree. Their degrees have just as much integrity as anyone else’s. If transfer students can take community college courses in the fall and spring and still be credited, this begs the question of why matriculated Trojans can’t do the same. 
Six different higher education groups — the American Association of Community Colleges, the Association of American Universities, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, the American Council of Education and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities — have called on institutions like USC to be flexible with credit policies in this unprecedented crisis. They argue that if universities seek to serve their communities and the public good — which should be an unequivocal given — they must be willing to experiment with and commit to novel practices. For USC, waiving the undergraduate transfer credit policy for the upcoming school year would be an excellent start.
Students whose families have been financially devastated by the pandemic should not have to bring their education to a screeching halt if they cannot afford USC tuition. If USC cares for its students beyond simply seeking to empty their pockets, the University will put its money where its mouth is and implement policies that allow all Trojans to thrive.

As a private institution, USC relies heavily on recurring donations and alumni endowments. Because of the generosity of successful alumni and community philanthropists, USC is home to luxurious educational amenities. From the $50 million contribution from the Annenberg Foundation that led to the unveiling of the new Wallis Annenberg Hall in 2014 to the $260 million donation for unspecified improvements that the school received late last year, foundations and private donors have unparalleled power.
Just like a Sims game, campus administration, donors and the Board of Trustees constantly make additions and tweaks to campus. From revamps of the University’s brick-lined walkways to the rapid construction of pristine academic centers, the structural improvements undertaken on campus are often effective and efficient. While University donors are in large part responsible for the aesthetic value of our sunny campus, their decisions also affect campus culture and student experiences.
As many students know, Rufus von KleinSmid, the University’s fifth president, was a prominent eugenicist. While he was celebrated for the expansion of the University’s educational programs and student body during his tenure as president, his accomplishments were directly at odds with his racism and publications on “forced sterilization.” Given USC’s attention to detail, it is difficult to comprehend how such a controversial bust and building have existed on campus for so many years without change.
Von KleinSmid’s name and likeness have become infamously synonymous with USC and those with the ability to enforce major change should consider how that has impacted campus culture and life from a student perspective. Since its construction in 1966, generations of Trojans of all ethnicities have attended classes in The Center for International and Public Affairs, known until June 11 as the Von KleinSmid Center. Disturbingly, the building named after the prominent 20th-century eugenicist also houses flags of countries from around the world and features a globe atop its tower to signify the diversity of student life on campus.
President Carol Folt’s decision to remove the statue and rename the building was long overdue — petitions and protests to rename one of the largest fixtures on campus have been ongoing for several years — and it should be a wake-up call for administrators, educators, alumni, donors and affiliates of the Trojan Family. Those with money and the power to influence campus culture need to wield their power with both efficacy and awareness. 
The Board, comprising some of USC’s most prominent donors and community leaders, oversees academic, student and public affairs as well as University development. From dealing with scandals to appointing campus leaders, its decisions often directly impact students’ experiences at the University. The renaming of one of the largest and most central buildings on campus is something that should have been not only acknowledged but also actualized by the Board years ago.
As a school that describes itself as “pluralistic, welcoming outstanding men and women of every race, creed and background” and “unfettered by political control, strongly committed to academic freedom,” USC must do more for its students than provide high-quality academic instruction. The administration has already made tangible change by implementing aid policies that will make a college education more financially accessible for students of all backgrounds — now, it has the opportunity to address centuries of racial marginalization and inequalities as well.
Donors, alumni and administrators of the University should pride themselves on upholding these values and understand that their influence and generosity speak volumes. It’s natural that those with large endowments in their names pull major weight when it comes to big decisions at the University, but donors should be more conscientious about where their money is going and the impact they have on students’ college experience.
Altering monuments and institutions built upon historical foundations of racial discrimination and bigotry is no small task. Statues will be taken down and names of buildings changed, but much more concentration is needed to effectively address institutionalized racism in the world of higher education. Inexhaustible discussion and action must be taken on both local and national scales in order to enact lasting positive change in what is currently a broken system. USC’s progressive stance and press statements mean nothing if they aren’t reinforced via substantive action. The University’s mere tolerance of diversity is not enough — the absence of outright racial oppression is not synonymous with equal opportunity. 
From creating more scholarships for first-generation students and donating to establish resource centers for marginalized students to funding entirely new areas of study, the University must persist in confronting institutionalized racism, racial marginalization and profiling — moreover, it must celebrate and actively contribute to campus diversity and inclusion rather than just acknowledge it. The renaming of VKC is merely one (long-overdue) decision in a series of changes and improvements that must be made. USC’s donors and administrators have both the power and the responsibility to past, current and future members of the Trojan community to play an active role in inciting progress and palpable change.

Although USC has taken steps to express solidarity with its Black student community and the national Black Lives Matter movement, the administration must take its advocacy a step further and contribute proactively in the form of public and personal monetary donations. 
Considering that President Carol Folt will be offered a similar salary as that of her predecessor, C. L. Nikias — who “earned an annual base pay of more than $1 million” according to the Los Angeles Times and was the eighth-highest paid university chief executive in his final year according to The Chronicle of Higher Education — her lack of a personal public contribution is jarring. It is no far stretch to assume that Folt would not be worse off if she donated. 
USC’s steps to demonstrate solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in the weeks following the killing of George Floyd and the nationwide protests that ensued have ranged from the welcomed (after years of student advocacy, the University finally removed known eugenicist Rufus von KleinSmid’s name from the formerly known Von KleinSmid Center) to the performative (although the University called attention to the USC Black Lives Matter March, administrators were visibly absent from the protest). Most notable among the missing administrators was Folt herself: While a University spokesperson expressed she did not attend for health reasons but “was very supportive of the march,” her lack of direct support was called out by those who commented on USC’s Instagram post about the protests.
That is not to say that Folt has remained completely silent on the issue. On May 31, she addressed the necessity of dealing with racism on campus in a communitywide email, stating that “we need to rely on each other and help each other and our neighbors through these times.” However, without the follow-through required to validate these comments, these statements begin to assume a form of performativity that renders the initial message, no matter how sincere, counterproductive. For an administrator who did not even show up to the single campuswide Black Lives Matter protest, her actions (or lack thereof) only confirm the distance that Folt has from those protesting.
This begs the question of what Folt can feasibly do to cement her allyship and elevate the University’s Black community. Personally donating to organizations in the Los Angeles area, along with larger California-based organizations, would be a fantastic start. Organizations such as Community Coalition, which works to develop a “community institution that involves thousands in creating, influencing and changing public policy,” and JusticeLA, which is based around “reclaiming, reimagining and reinvesting dollars away from incarceration and into community-based systems of care,” would certainly benefit from large financial contributions. No one loses in this scenario: Folt can establish that she is willing to put money where her mouth is, local organizations can rake in large amounts of funding and USC students can feel confident that their president did not settle for performative activism.
In addition, Folt would have the rare opportunity to set a national standard; university chief executives across the United States are failing to support their Black students beyond half-baked messages of solidarity and the occasional renaming of a building with a racist namesake. If Folt were to come forth with a sizable donation to a local organization, especially if it were a personal donation directly from her own funds, she could potentially pave the way for other university presidents to step forward with financial donations of their own.
It is not only Folt who should feel the pressure of this financial obligation; other elite administrators, most of whom are paid exorbitant amounts, ought to fulfill this duty as well. According to the L.A. Times, football head coach Clay Helton was paid roughly $3.2 million for the 2017-18 fiscal year. Andy Enfield, the current men’s basketball head coach at USC, was paid almost $2.8 million in the same year. Sure, Helton was quoted on June 9 telling the Hotline that “If a young man wants to take a knee, [Helton’s] job is to support them” — but words are nowhere near enough. Considering that top sports executives such as Helton and Enfield profit off of the hard work put in by Black student-athletes, it is insulting that these executives do not publicly donate to the Black Lives Matter movement as a show of solidarity with their students.
If Folt stepped forward with a personal financial donation, it would send the powerful message that administrators and university chief executives ought to directly incite tangible change rather than just encourage it. There is no better time for a statement like this to be made — it’s up to Folt to follow through.

Rising junior Emma Boudin works late into the night on art pieces spread across her living room floor, carefully editing graphics directly on Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. Boudin spends hours choosing between bright neon colors and searching for new design inspiration in music. 
“My designs are so much more accessible to everyone because it’s graphic,” said Boudin, who is majoring in design. “Through graphic work, you can just do and make anything, like digital portraits, posters, album covers … I love how it makes everything so easy.”
When she was a student at Long Island High School for the Arts in New York, Boudin was initially interested in installation art and fine arts, including more tactile forms such as paintings and sculptures. But Boudin’s high school curriculum and after-school arts program eventually led her to develop an interest in graphic design. 
During her senior year of high school, she was hired to create a merchandise logo for her first client, female musician Vaeda Black. After the project, Boudin decided she wanted to work with other artists and have her designs showcased in the music industry. Boudin promotes her recent work and past experience in freelance design directly on her social media. 
Boudin posts her designs to the Instagram account “Boudin Collective” where she aims to develop her personal brand. Using social media, Boudin has connected with local artists and found new projects to take on. According to Sara Sturek, a rising junior majoring in creative writing and communication, Boudin has found ways to support other artists. 
“Emma’s definitely a champion for all artists,” Sturek said. “She’s always buying people’s work, even if they’re just starting, just to show her support or promoting on social media, like [she’ll] be posting stories and then attending galleries all over Downtown.” 
Boudin has sought to organically grow her social media presence. Similar to an art gallery, social media has allowed Boudin to showcase her artwork, giving her followers a sense of who she is as a person and creative. A social media presence is important for budding artists who are looking to highlight their work within an art exhibition, Boudin said.    
“If you’re an up-and-coming artist and you don’t have social media, usually galleries won’t take you,” Boudin said. “You really need to have like some sort of social presence in order to showcase your work or who you are.” 
Boudin is also the vice president of web design for SPEC, a USC magazine focused on fashion, lifestyle and wellness. She spends her days at the Roski School of Art and Design completing homework assignments and creating digital content for the magazine’s Instagram and merchandise. 
“[SPEC] is an on-campus lifestyle fashion blog magazine, and we basically just talk about everything under the sun, like what’s trending in pop culture,” Boudin said. “I also do a little bit of creative direction for SPEC.” 
Boudin’s background in fine arts has given her work more depth, according to rising junior Benjamin Matza. Her work is versatile — she has created designs for album and podcast covers and websites — but her style remains distinctive. Boudin is willing to take risks, especially by incorporating bright colors into her designs, Matza said.   
“She is willing to explore colors way more than most people,” said Matza, who is majoring in design. “She has really identifiable interests, and she incorporates that into her work.” 
Boudin’s proficiency in Adobe software and her experience in freelance design have helped her carry out her role as the head of digital and web design for the digital magazine and multimedia brand Off the Cassette. The magazine was founded by USC students Caroline Vein, a rising junior majoring in narrative studies, and Sophee Loftus, a rising senior majoring in cinema and media studies. 
The mission of Off the Cassette is to create a platform where artists and music-lovers can discuss music and collaborate. Off the Cassette curates music playlists and posts weekly blogs to its website. The project is run by a group of young women who advocate for more female representation in an industry that is primarily male-dominated. 
“I feel like the music industry is very male-driven. That’s something that has always irked me, and it drives me even harder,” Boudin said. “I just want women to have more of a say in the music industry.”
Off the Cassette has kept Boudin busy during quarantine because it requires group collaboration and consistent social media posts weekly to maintain value and engagement, she said. Boudin finds this project to be empowering, since she is surrounded by hardworking and talented women. 
“It’s just so empowering, like speaking to these talented women that are so driven. It’s really inspiring to me,” Boudin said.
But despite her busy schedule, Boudin finds time to attend concerts with friends and family. Boudin is an avid concertgoer who keeps a long list of concerts she has attended where she draws inspiration for her graphic designs, Matza said. 
“She’s really influenced by rock as well as more electronic [music] like Tame Impala type stuff, and I think that a lot of what she kind of imbues into her work is [a] sporadic and really energetic kind of design,” Matza said. 
When creating her designs, Boudin listens to all genres of music. In March, she reached out to rapper BambyH2O upon hearing from a friend that he was in search of album art for an unreleased project. Boudin completed her first album cover for Bamby in which she was given most of the creative control, but for now it is being kept under wraps. 
Moving forward, Boudin said she will continue to create designs for musicians and provide them with remarkable creative direction. A musician’s visual brand identity, especially one that can be digitally admired, is extremely important, she said.  
“I want my designs to be in the music industry, and I really want to work and cater and design and curate brand identities for artists,” Boudin said.“I think a visual brand identity is just super important for musicians. I think if you don’t have a cool visual component of who you are, it’s almost like then, ‘Who are you?’”
