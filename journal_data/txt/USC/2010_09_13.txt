The USC women’s cross-country team went to Saturday’s UC Irvine Invitational looking for a great start, and instead got a great finish.

Despite a sluggish beginning, the Women of Troy took sixth overall at the UC Irvine 5K meet thanks to a solid last half of the race.
“At the beginning of the season everyone makes mistakes,” coach Tom Walsh said. “And our mistake was being too tentative at [the start of the race]. We got out really slow, but I don’t think any other team finished as strong as we did. Our girls had more left than anybody.”
Senior Christine Cortez led the charge for USC, which ran without three of its top runners, and placed 22nd overall in a field of 122. Junior Leah Gaeta was next for the Women of Troy at 33rd overall, followed by senior Dina Kitayama at 38th.
Senior Zara Lukens and redshirt sophomore Jessica Lundin crossed the line 43rd and 45th, respectively. Freshman Jaclyn Walles and sophomore Kelly Owen went in back-to-back at 57th and 58th.
“Basically, everyone ran pretty close to what I thought they’d run,” Walsh said. “It was very consistent with how they’ve been practicing. I’d call it a pretty good effort.”
USC finished behind Cal Poly San Luis Opisbo, Azusa Pacific, Cal State San Marcos, UC Irvine and Pepperdine. USC’s squad, however, was missing senior Zsofia Erdelyi, redshirt sophomore Shelby Buckley and sophomore Kathleen Moloney, all expected to be top contributors once the season heats up. Despite the absences, Walsh still liked what he saw Saturday.
“Some girls need a few races to build into the season,” he said. “It was a good first race for them. They’re all just going to keep getting better and better.”
When asked for the most important thing he noticed at UC Irvine, Walsh returned to the team’s less-than-stellar start and strong finish, noting that things might have been different had the race been a longer distance.
“I think we’re ready for the 6K races,” Walsh said. “I’m actually a little disappointed that this wasn’t a 6K because I think our girls were as prepared to go a little longer as anyone else out there. But we’re going to have to work on the start because that didn’t help us at all.”
USC will have two weeks to improve its race tactics before a marquee meet at the Stanford Invitational in Palo Alto, Calif., on Sept. 25. The Women of Troy expect to run at full strength at the race Walsh calls “one of the most important of the season.”

The officiating crew that oversaw the Trojans’ 17-14 win over Virginia will be reprimanded and taken off a future assignment because of a botched call, the Pac-10 notified the University of Virigina Monday.
The call came after a Cavaliers’ fake punt with 11 minutes left in the second quarter. Virginia punter Jummy Howell threw a 35-yard pass to tight end Colter Phillips that put the Cavs on the Trojans’ 25-yard line, but the play was called back because of what the officials called an illegal chop block. Because it was negated, Virginia punted the ball away.
Virginia sent out a release detailing what the Pac-10 had to say on the matter:
“The Pac-10 has disciplined the officials involved in last Saturday’s Virginia-USC football game for failure to apply the playing rules correctly, Commissioner Larry Scott announced today. Those officials involved in making the call have been reprimanded and will be removed from a future game assignment.
The officials misapplied rules for blocking below the waist on a Virginia fake punt in the second quarter. According to the playing rules, blocking below the waist anywhere on the field by either team is illegal if the offense is lined up in a scrimmage kick formation, unless a kick is not made.
‘The officials recognized the mistake after the fact and apologized to the Virginia coaching staff,’ Scott said. ‘We know mistakes are made in games, but we will not tolerate our officials misinterpreting the rules. We believe the reprimand and removal from a future assignment are appropriate.’”

Three new but familiar faces will be in the dugout at Dedeaux Field this spring.
Former USC baseball players Alberto Concepcion, Cyle Hankerd and Morgan Ensberg were named assistant coaches Monday by interim head coach Frank Cruz.
Ensberg is the most notable of the three, having played third base for eight seasons in the Major Leagues.
The Hermosa Beach, Calif., native played for the Houston Astros from 2000 to 2006, the San Diego Padres in 2007, and finished his career with the New York Yankees in 2008. A lifetime .263 hitter, Ensberg also racked up 110 home runs, 347 RBI and 332 walks over the course of his career, and made All-Star and World Series appearances with the Astros in 2005.
While at USC, Ensberg helped lead the Trojans to a national title in 1998, including a 2-4, three-run performance in a 21-14 national championship game win over Arizona State. He was drafted by the Astros in the ninth round of the 1998 MLB draft.
Hankerd is a Covina, Calif., native and former Trojan outfielder who played for three years from 2004 to 2006. He hit .340 in his USC career, with 107 runs scored and 123 RBI.
Hankerd helped lead the Trojans to the postseason is 2005 and was named an All-Pac-10 selection in 2006 before being drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the third round of the 2006 MLB draft. He played parts of four seasons in the minors for Arizona, including a stint at the AAA level earlier this year.
Concepcion played catcher for the Trojans from 2000 to 2002, finishing with a .334 career average, 26 home runs and 111 RBIs.
The El Segundo, Calif., native was drafted out of high school by the San Diego Padres in the second round of the 1999 MLB draft, but passed on the pros to play at USC.
He helped the Trojans to fifth place finishes at the College World Series in 2000 and 2001, and was an All-Pac-10 selection in 2002. He played in the minors for six years from 2002 to 2008, reaching the AAA level twice.
The coaches will make their debut on Feb. 18, when the Trojans host a four-team weekend tournament at Dedeaux Field to open the season.

It was the same stride he had always taken in pursuit of the ball.
The footsteps were so routine for the seemingly polished nose tackle that when senior Christian Tupou fell to the ground without being touched during last May’s spring game at the Coliseum, an anxious and energetic crowd was quickly reduced to a collective gasp.

Comeback · Senior nose tackle Christian Tupou is out for the season with a knee injury, but he has not let it affect his tireless comeback efforts. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
What it had just witnessed was the painful outcome of football’s sometimes inevitable injury plague: the ending of a young man’s season before it even began.
If the grim reality of Tupou’s torn knee ligaments got lost in the shuffle amid sanction rulings, coaching changes and the resulting collective state of depression, don’t bother buying your tissues now — the Sacramento native wants no sympathy on his long road back to the field.
In fact, somewhere between the monotony of the training table and his hard-to-miss cheerleading routines on the sidelines of the Howard Jones Field, the physical wounds sustained from that May afternoon seem to have faded into the background these last four months. In their place is the 21-year-old’s unmistakable desire to utilize his time away from the field as a chance to grow as a teammate and as a student of the game.
To put it bluntly, Tupou’s day-to-day rehabilitation schedule would have any Lyon Center gym rat rethinking his definition of a workout.
Although Tupou is insistent on downplaying how tough the process really is, his hours spent in the training room are about as comfortable as witnessing a McCourt divorce proceeding.
They don’t include some relaxing ice baths or a cushy rubdown. No, Tupou’s journey back to the gridiron consists of daily squat reps, agility ladders using only his hands, Romanian deadlifting with weights that far exceed twice my body mass and core stabilizing exercises that are about as uplifting as a George Orwell novel.
But if you truly want to peer into the bend-but-don’t-break mind of an athlete who is determined to turn agony into achievement, look no further than the self-appointed position he has taken on among his teammates — vocal leader.
“Now, I always support my teammates,” Tupou said. “I wasn’t real vocal before, but now I am. I am putting my all into it, and just trying to help the defensive line get ready to play. The biggest thing I’ve learned from all of this is the importance of being patient. My time will come, I know that. So just don’t rush this.”
Despite the 6-foot-2, 290-pound lineman’s noticeable vigilance and patience throughout his left knee’s slow progression, it’s what he has learned as a bystander, rather than as an on-field energy infuser, that might ultimately make the biggest difference when No. 44 runs between the white lines in 2011.
At first glance, Tupou’s pre-injury numbers in 2009 — 25 tackles, 1.5 sacks and two forced fumbles — would tell you that the former Grant High School standout was primed for a breakout season in Monte Kiffin’s defensive tackle-friendly Tampa 2 scheme.
But what statistics and All-Pac-10 honorable mentions often fail to reflect is whether or not that mantra of a commitment to excellence is merely lip service or a genuine depiction of an always-constant “on” switch activated in the mind of an athlete.
For Tupou, that eventful day at the Coliseum gave him the opportunity most collegiate football players would happily choose to neglect — a time to look in the mirror and accept the responsibility of prior shortcomings.
“Staying into everything mentally has been a big key in my rehabilitation,” Tupou admitted. “Before when I was playing, I took advantage of a lot of things. I wasn’t finishing every single thing and really wasn’t a perfect player — that’s what I want to picture myself as. It’s something I want to work on when I come back.”
Though each step on his road to restoration and transformation has been paved with new quandaries and obstacles, Tupou is every bit the part of your exception to the rule.
Twelve months is a daunting figure.
The imposing and sometimes deleterious set of limitations have a remarkable way of making even the most well-known football luminaries crumble beneath the shields of masculinity and bravado they’ve constructed during their lifelong love affair with the gridiron.
But this tale is not about your common man, because in every way, shape and form Tupou is deviating more and more from the norm.
Tupou is appreciative when others would question. He is gregarious when others would find solace in their tears and pity parties. And he finds strength in places the unwritten party line of sports would assume were better suited to fear.
But fear has no place in the life of a young man who has his head in all the right places. Instead, Tupou holds on tightly to his plan for revival.
First it was regaining the power to walk, now it’s gaining enough strength in his gait to jog; over the next few months he will happily cross off one-leg squats, then complete squats and vertical jumps, and finally will raise his bench press weight up to around 500 pounds.
And those are only the football-related goals; his medical redshirt has also afforded him the ability to further pursue post-graduate work at the Annenberg School for Communications & Journalism.
Talk about finding a silver lining.

The No. 1 women’s golf team wasted no time introducing its much-heralded recruiting class to NCAA competition.
The Women of Troy began their season Monday at the 2010 Texas A&M Fall Preview at the Traditions Golf Club in College Station, Texas. The team hit a collective 1-over-par 289, putting the team in fifth place  and 12 strokes behind No. 13 Georgia.
Setting up · Senior Lizette Salas had a strong first round at the 2010 Texas A&M Fall Preview, shooting a two-under-par 70 to finish in ninth place. The Women of Troy, who are currently in fifth place overall, have two more days of competition in Texas. - Courtesy of USC Sports Information
Freshmen Rachel Morris and Sophia Poppov made their collegiate debuts, and junior transfer Lisa McCloskey, a two-time All-American at Pepperdine, made her USC debut. All three finished in the top 40 on day one.
Even with the influx of new talent on the roster, it was the two returning members that paced the team on the first day.
Senior Lizette Salas finished the day with a 2-under-par 70, enough to land her in ninth place and five strokes off the lead. A solid back nine with two birdies gave Salas the team’s only under-par score for the day.
Sophomore Cyna Rodriguez, the only other returning member from last year’s NCAA runner-up squad, is tied for 18th after shooting an even par 72. Rodriguez also finished 2-under on the back to make up for a front nine that included three bogeys.
Morris finished one stroke back of Rodriguez at 1-over-par 73. Her three birdies nearly offset four bogeys and tied her for 21st.
One stroke behind Morris is McCloskey at 2-over-par 74. She had one birdie against three bogeys to tie for 30th.
Popov is one stroke behind McCloskey at 3-over-par 75, in a tie for 40th.
“We played pretty solid, but not our best. I was pleased overall, because I like to see all five players in it and with a chance to count,” said USC coach Andrea Gaston, referring to the NCAA rule that a team can only take the four top scores on the five-person team.
The Fall Preview is used to give teams a look at the course that will host the NCAA Championship in May. A tropical storm last week left the area more damp than usual this week, and as a result the course remained extremely hot and humid.
“The heat is pretty oppressive,” Gaston said. “But the conditions are softer, and I feel like it’s playing easier than usual. One thing I know about Texas is that a little wind can change everything.”
The team has two more rounds today and Wednesday.

What could a band named after a jagged swamp animal possibly have in store?
Surprisingly enough, the band — a duo of Charles Rowell and Brandon Welchez —­ has a mellow, melancholic sound, with tracks that include catchy drum beats and stand-out lyrics.

The band’s new album Sleep Forever contains this musical blend, presenting an overall subdued-yet-energetic mood that carries throughout the album, even down to the cover art — an eerie photograph of what looks to be a funeral, the image hazed in a cloud of purple color.
But don’t let the cover scare you away. The album is not a depressing tale of death and sorrow, but instead a creation that tackles emotions with a blend of shoegazer style, artistic lyrics and natural harmonization.
The tempo bounces in speed from track to track. “Mirrors” starts off the album with the soft entrance of a guitar note, followed by a friendly drum beat and the eclectic harmony of the duo. Fast-forward a few tracks, the band then offers “Billy Speed,” which immediately plunges into a cymbal-happy, fuzzy guitar track, with the echo sound used to full effect. Fittingly enough, the track perfectly tunes into the speed of a reckless drive down a deserted street in the middle of the night. But in doing so, it limits itself — the loudness of the track could possibly overpower listeners who feel their fragile ears are being bombarded with too much sound.
The calmer side of Crocodiles forces listeners to take a break from a stressful, hectic day and just sit down and listen. Oftentimes, this characteristic sound can nonetheless be lost in the hustle and bustle of the daily life. This album is no compilation of party tracks or workout tunes but instead the perfect background for a smooth drive an artsy film.
Lead singer Welchez’s voice is one of the band’s driving forces of the band and constantly echoes while he carefully sings. The duo saves its crowning gem for the end, with a repeating line that reverberates in the listener’s mind.
The final track, “All My Hate and My Hexes Are for You,” creates romantic sounds but shatters the profile of most love songs, which create coy tracks for an object of affection. This amorous track throws venomous words at an unknown subject in an alternative love song — a declaration that there is so much love, there is hate. The song rides along bouncily and keeps the refrain simple, looping until it becomes embedded in the listener’s mind, each note hit by the singer giving voice to another emotion in the complicated story.
The lyricism only adds to the song’s appeal. The band crafts lyrics with an unusually dedicated care that is rarely seen, the words striving not merely to rhyme with each other but to create a complex meaning. Welchez sings tenderly, “Your face at night / drills a tick-tock in my brain / digs canals across my face,” and just as sweetly repeats the line “all my hate and my hexes are for you.” Though at times the premise of the song is confusing, including when he utters that “all the eyes of the little girls / will be flames that dance and twirl,” the song manages to create an uncommon imagery and atmosphere.
Sleep Forever has the potential to either expand musical limits or cause widespread confusion, depending on the listener’s taste. Fans of shoegazer definitely need to peruse its contents while those looking for pop hooks are in the wrong place. The guitar chords and the effervescent voice of the lead singer recall the sounds of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, but the lyrics are all their own.
What remains certain is the band’s investment in its complex craft. Its debut album Summer of Hate, released last year, received wide acclaim from numerous publications, including Rolling Stone magazine, for its departure from mainstream music and injection of artsy and punk sounds.
The band will start its tour Sept. 17 in Las Vegas, and surely will attract a variety of listeners yearning for a different sound and an interesting experience. With expert guidance from producer James Ford, who has also worked with bands such as Florence and the Machine and the Arctic Monkeys, the album proves a trademark stamp on the music world, and is definitely worthy of purchase for those seeking an alternative sound.

There’s something equally shocking and admirable about the love that the Killers’ frontman Brandon Flowers has for his notorious hometown, Las Vegas.

Charming gentleman · Flowers’ new album mixes a variety of genres, from Johnny Cash to gospel, as well as a nod to Pet Shop Boys. - Photo courtesy of Press Here Publicity
For the last six years, the talented songwriter has demonstrated his unique ability to craft lyrics that portray a hopeful, somewhat mythical version of Vegas, without ignoring the reality of widespread gluttony that attracts millions to Sin City every year. In each of the Killers’ four studio albums since they erupted onto the American popular music scene with 2004’s Grammy-nominated Hot Fuss, the band has consistently paid tribute to its hometown.
Whether through the Vegas iconography that is sprinkled throughout its songs or the mustached Western cowboy look the band members assumed for its sophomore effort, Sam’s Town, it is impossible to separate the Killers from their roots.
The near nonstop touring since Hot Fuss’ release garnered them mega-band status that finally caught up with the band members this year. In January, the group published a short post on its website announced that it would be going on hiatus. It was during this period of downtime that Flowers, a self-described workaholic, cultivated the idea of developing a solo project and recruited the aid several talented producers, including U2 collaborator Daniel Lanois.
What Flowers has created is an album so dramatically drenched in Vegas lore that it is only fitting that its title borrows directly from the name of one of the oldest casinos on the Vegas Strip — Flamingo.
At once as bombastic and energetic as the previous Killers albums, Flamingo also stands apart from the band’s traditional sound because of Flowers’ willingness to experiment with both his lyrics and his vocals.
A chorus of distant crickets transports the listener to a dusky horizon in Vegas which begins to darken as Flowers’ quivering falsetto causes the blood-red Western sun to set on the city in the introductory “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas.” Right away, Flowers’ love for his hometown shines brightly through lyrics backed by religious conviction, such as his description of a crowded boulevard as a “neon-encrusted temple” and a visitor to the city as “looking for God in the arms of a fellow stranger.”
The song is partly mocking the dreamers and harlots for whom Vegas is truly a holy place, yet it successfully steers away from stereotypical Vegas showmanship with Flowers’ stinging sincerity. The Vegas city council might not like it, but Flowers has constructed one of the most accurate and bitingly realistic portrayals of the infamous city — one that should, but will certainly not, play during its famous tourism commercials.
Songs such as “Jilted Lovers & Broken Hearts,” “Crossfire” and “Magdalena,” with their insanely catchy vocal hooks and choruses, further prove Flowers’ ability to create radio-friendly tunes. But listeners who would like to hear a style different from the lead singer’s pre-packaged Killers sound will devour “Playing With Fire,” a moody alternative rock song that slowly builds into a six-minute epic. The wails of the guitar dance with Flowers’ falsetto as he preaches about angels, demons and taking a sip from a “rolling river of truth.” Another song, titled “On the Floor,” concludes with a gospel choir reminiscent of the Killers’ signature track “All These Things That I’ve Done,” but it is Flowers’ Johnny Cash-esque baritone drawl that makes it a must-listen.
Like any hot hand playing in a Vegas casino, Flamingo’s ambition can only last so long before it cools down. “Hard Enough,” the much anticipated duet between Flowers and Rilo Kiley’s lead vocalist Jenny Lewis, is mired in mediocrity and failed potential as Lewis’ voice is overshadowed by a singer who is not used to sharing the spotlight. The album’s worst crime is “Swallow It,” a bizarre pop tune complete with an uncomfortably vague title.
All is forgiven in the album’s deluxe edition featuring four additional tracks. Flowers bounces along to the country ditty “The Clock Was Tickin’” and hints at one of his major influences, Pet Shop Boys, with “Jacksonville,” which grows on the listener after repeated listens.
It does not matter if the Killers ever actually make good on Flowers’ promise to make one of the best albums people will remember 20 years from now. Their place in music history has already been established through the creativity and earnestness that they have developed through an undying adoration for their hometown.

USC alumna Heather Apraku is primed for the Pasadena debut of her restaurant, Mix n’ Munch, a trendy, comfort-food cafe specializing in grilled cheese sandwiches and cereal.
This concept was not one of Apraku’s childhood daydreams: the Mix n’ Munch idea materialized much later, but like the warm Asiago of her sandwiches and the marshmallows in her milk, the decision felt right at home.
“My sister has always loved cereal, and when she was young she thought it would be great to open a cereal restaurant,” Apraku said. “I loved the idea as well, but it was always considered just a fun idea.”
As part of her master’s thesis in communication at USC, a project for her master’s degree which she completed in 2009, Apraku was presented with the opportunity to design a business plan, and forged ahead with the concept. Although seemingly limited in scope, Apraku saw in it a universal appeal.
“They are both classic comfort foods that you ate as a child,” Apraku said.
To Apraku, it would be food that brought customers back to their formative years. The simplicity of the ingredients would broaden, not narrow, the appeal.
After the business plan was completed, Apraku and her sister began searching for property. Last February, they finally discovered a fitting venue in South Pasadena and initiated architecture and design plans for the space. Apraku was also working full-time at USC as an administrative assistant to the College Dean’s Office, however. With menus in the works and an overwhelming array of other logistics, something had to give.
“We had hoped to open in the summer, but being first-time restaurant owners there were a lot of things that we were learning on the job and that slowed us down,” Apraku said.
Thus, as many dreammakers tend to do, Apraku left a steady job in order to chase something deemed fiscally uncertain.
“I really enjoyed working in the Dean’s Office, and although I didn’t think I would be there forever, I was in no hurry to leave, especially as the economy worsened and jobs were so hard to come by,” she said. “It actually was a little scary for me to leave USC.”
Yet, as she nears the grand opening of Mix n’ Munch, Apraku exudes a confidence that defies our dark economic times.
“I believe in our business so much that it was worth the risk,” she said.
Although Apraku has dedicated herself to Mix n’ Munch and could not have done so without tough skin and passion for her business, the idea of owning a restaurant that serves primarily grilled cheese and cereal was never part of the plan.
“As a kid I had no idea I would eventually own my own restaurant,” she said. “I always knew what I didn’t want to do, but never knew what I wanted to do.”
I think this is true of many undergrads. Often, we choose majors based on the inherent range of opportunities, when desire eventually surfaces. But until that time, we must keep ourselves open to spontaneity, introspection and exploration of the unknown. One major misconception of those students who major in something broad such as business administration, or communication is that they lack desire.
The reason for this is that a huge discrepancy exists between what people want in life and what they want as their lifelong career.
No matter the discipline, everyone dreams; everyone hopes for a job that is gratifying.
“I think the worse thing is to be stifled or feel stuck in something,” Apraku said. “I personally think it is important to do what you enjoy and what makes you happy.”
Oftentimes, many students end up falling into that dream accidentally. Friends and family come out of the woodwork and tell you it makes perfect sense that you’re doing that specific job because you’ve always loved guitar, graphic novels or cooking. Maybe you never thought of a hobby as a career, but it’s more likely you never thought of that hobby as something viable.
“I have always loved food, so although it was not something I always knew I would do. Most people that know me tell me that it is very fitting that I am opening a restaurant,” Apraku said.
If nothing else, we all need to be aware of what fills us. What is it that gets us through the workday? What do we babble on about without realizing? And what gets us to light up like a Christmas tree? Who knows, maybe your dream is staring up at you too, as simple and sweet as Sunday breakfast.

Some 30 miles east of USC, as the urban-sprawl strip malls blur together along the ever-expanding lanes of the 10 Freeway, the Fairplex exit passes as a blip as one speeds through Pomona. A quick detour through a sleepy neighborhood reveals the Los Angeles County Fair.

Fried extravaganza · The L.A. County Fair offers savory fried goods like hamburgers, fried Klondike bars (above). - Colin Mackenzie | Daily Trojan 
Surrounded by a moat masquerading as a dirt parking lot, the L.A. County Fair is a glinting neon oasis that emerges annually in September to provide any and every sense of entertainment desired.
Walking past the pie display case, the miracle medicine exhibitions, the lumberjack competition and the animatronic dinosaurs, each seems more anachronistic than the previous, and yet nothing seems particularly wrong. The county fair is the catchall: no carnival ride too daunting, no musical act too obscure and no peddled knickknack too homey to be turned away.
Ultimately, though a relic of the days of swelling pride over blue-ribbon hogs, today’s county fairs have remained relevant for one purpose: the celebration and advancement of fried food.
Although it does not feature trendy national darlings such as deep-fried beer or butter, the L.A. County Fair makes an impressive effort to provide a culinary spread fit for a coronary embolism.
As a fried-food enthusiast and longtime resident of the South, my quest was to uncover the inventive, alarming and obscene fried fare, the food whose name alone evokes simultaneous glee and disgust; the items our bodies regret eating almost immediately. The stuff that makes Thomas Keller hang his head in shame; not your run-of-the-mill deep-fried frog legs, mushrooms and Twinkies.
Under the blistering sun, my heart sputtering, I put forth this not-quite-definitive highlight reel of the L.A. County Fair’s fried food feast.
Avocado Bites
Perhaps there’s a reason why one rarely sees fried avocado on a menu — it’s just not any good. A cakey batter and a hot temperature betray the cool, buttery purpose of eating an avocado in the first place. Combined with the fact that the advertised pesto dip was nowhere to be found, the avocado lies squarely in the “don’t buy” column. Save your money, save your waistline and keep walking.
Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich
On paper, this seems like a flawless idea ­— essentially, the distant culinary cousin of a jelly doughnut. Unfortunately, the nuance of food preparation was checked at the entrance gate. What amounts to a glorified, crunchy Uncrustable fails to deliver any sort of lasting impression. Doughy white bread, a small squirt of peanut butter and seemingly molten hot jelly combine for a rare and painfully disappointing item.
Klondike Bar
Boasting arguably the biggest upside/downside of the fried food array, the Klondike Bar appears to be (based on advertising and signage) the food providers’ crown jewel. Admittedly, from conception to execution, this could be the greatest fair food invented — but it isn’t.
Taking a large bite, I expected a seamless blend of crispy batter, chocolate coating and vanilla ice cream. Instead my Klondike Bar had transformed into the world’s largest vanilla gusher.
Some of the blame falls squarely on me: I let this glimmering cube sit for five minutes, giving it ample melting time. Mind the brief expiration date, and you might find the future king of desserts.
Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups
The discovery of a Reese’s Peanut Butter bar  this entire eating adventure a success. As is often the case, the simplest concept yields the tastiest result, with only one bar, one stick and one vat of corn oil.
A bite reveals a perfect pairing of semi-solid milk chocolate and viscous peanut butter, accompanied by a resounding crunch through the batter. The stick brings everything together, making this the ideal walking snack, or frankly, the ideal snack in general.
White Castle Hamburger
Ironically, the food item that seems to have the least to gain from a hot oil bath came the closest to golden, gleaming perfection. Freed from the hindrance of vegetables, this is straight hamburger: bun, ground beef and cheese.
The fryer engineers really hit the construction on the mark, here. The bun disintegrates into the batter, leaving the eater with three distinct layers: warm, velvety bread, a steaming slice of patty and a show-stopping, oozing layer of melted cheese leaking through every crevasse of the glistening dome. Order the hamburger.
If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, or if you just came in a couple pounds under your goal, or heck — if it’s a Friday night — order two. This culinary behemoth, this abomination of food, this is why a county fair exists.

A bite reveals a perfect pairing of semi-solid milk chocolate and viscous peanut butter, accompanied by a resounding crunch through the batter. The stick brings everything together, making this the ideal walking snack, or frankly, the ideal snack in general.
White Castle Hamburger
Ironically, the food item that seems to have the least to gain from a hot oil bath came the closest to golden, gleaming perfection. Freed from the hindrance of vegetables, this is straight hamburger: bun, ground beef and cheese.
The fryer engineers really hit the construction on the mark, here. The bun disintegrates into the batter, leaving the eater with three distinct layers: warm, velvety bread, a steaming slice of patty and a show-stopping, oozing layer of melted cheese leaking through every crevasse of the glistening dome. Order the hamburger.
If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, or if you just came in a couple pounds under your goal, or heck — if it’s a Friday night — order two. This culinary behemoth, this abomination of food, this is why a county fair exists.

The phrase “background check” generally holds a negative connotation. You think of a private investigator trying to uncover a scandal. You think of politicians.
You’re not as quick to think of college applications.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Most universities — about 64 percent, according to the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers — tell applicants to disclose their criminal records. Some students choose to withhold that information and leave it to the colleges to dig up the dirt, something most colleges do not have the time or resources to do. Still, it is a necessary step for admissions officers to take when reviewing an application, just as it is when reviewing a transcript.
At first glance, this might seem to be an invasion of privacy. It would appear that colleges do not give people with a checkered past a chance. Background checks, however,  are essential to preserving safety, both on campus and within the student body. By making the necessary effort to determine whether the students on campus have clean records, colleges are taking a progressive step toward ensuring that everyone — from students to employees — are safe.
If colleges can reject students for low grade point averages, low test scores or a weak essay, why shouldn’t they be allowed to reject students with criminal records?
Currently, most universities don’t perform background checks on applicants ­— only about 4 percent of universities go through with a background check, according to a survey by the AACRAO. Compare that to the 92 percent of businesses that do carry out background checks on job applicants. The safety of a college campus should be tantamount to that of an office workplace.
Many universities require exorbitant funds for tuition and other fees; they should be able to dedicate a portion of those resources to hiring people responsible for conducting basic criminal checks on applicants.
Scores of institutions, including the University of North Carolina and the University of Virginia, have amped up their screening processes following violent incidents on campus. Although minor acts of violence are inevitable, admissions offices need to take every step possible to protect the student body from tragedy. They should refocus their time — instead of searching a student’s name on Google and perusing their Facebook photos to make sure they aren’t participating in underage drinking, they should be investigating a history of violence.
That is not to say students with criminal records should be excluded from the collegiate system entirely. Public schools are funded by the government, and as such are designed to serve the general public. Applicants who have shown clear evidence of a turnaround and change in behavior should not be deprived of a college education if no private school will admit them. If the transgressions on an applicant’s record are not serious enough that the school feels he would endanger the campus, then private and especially public schools should consider accepting him.
Essentially, these applicants should comply with any requests by the admissions committee to learn more about them. With measures such as additional interviews, the admissions committees could gain a thorough understanding of the situation, as opposed to simply reading their criminal reports and subsequently eliminating them from the applicant pool.
Accepted applicants should be required to have a face-to-face interview with an admissions officer in order to be fully certain the applicant does not present a threat.
Those who have shown they have changed should be able to move forward with their lives and have the college experience they earned, regardless of what might have appeared on their background checks.
Cyrus Behzadi is a freshman majoring in communication.
What about if the student is under 18 during the application process, as most are, would they not be classified as a child still?
Many violent incidents are carried out by those with mental health problems.  What about screening for that? Also, what about those who have had treatment for drug or alcohol addiction? They could turn violent if they have a relapse.  And don’t forget those who had a fight or other violent incident in high school.

It began with separate but equal — our war against the politically correct.
Those who were ignorant were blissful, and those who weren’t found whatever solace they could in their ceaseless pleas for change. Of course, their efforts were not in vain;  a few decades ago, it seemed like the majority of people had chosen tolerance, acceptance and maybe a little psychedelic love. Fast-forward to 2010, I’d argue that racism and general prejudice toward anything short of homogeneity have once again come to the foreground.
Now before you think that I managed to start running with a pack of outlandish bigots that flew under the USC radar until this moment, hear me out. Discrimination has once again entered common dialogue through today’s liberal irony. The Millennials, of course, are sitting at the epicenter of post-tolerance.
Society is nothing if not cyclical. We do our best to learn from our mistakes, but as the saying goes, we’re only human.
Not many people used to be politically correct, and that was fine because the phrase hadn’t yet defined right and wrong. Soon after came the age of carefully worded, politically correct eggshell terms as we began to tiptoe around each other to keep the peace and warm fuzzies abundant. No longer. Today, it’s hip to wax offensive for the sake of ironic banter. It’s as if our entire society’s skin thickened and we can now slur away because everyone knows it’s just for giggles.
Of course it’s not a full circle; I wouldn’t say that the norm has once again become to tolerate the intolerant. But there is without a doubt an alarming trend we encounter more and more every day. On game day, I could not count the amount of times I heard the N-word dropped on McCarthy Quad. It’s raucous and wild and no one stops to think about it during a jungle juice toast to victory, but sometimes this pseudo-harmless verbal fun does actually spiral into hate crimes.
Take for instance the incidents that occurred on the UC San Diego campus in February, when the poorly-themed “Compton Cookout”party serving fried chicken and watermelon escalated into a noose hanging in the library. I would like to hope that we are conscientious enough to draw the line, but that’s not always the case.
No more than a decade ago, it was a struggle for gay and lesbian students to have a confident voice on college campuses. Today, some gay students are comfortable enough with public opinion to have reclaimed an offensive moniker or two — even using “that’s so gay” to describe something they themselves thought was stupid. Confidence and comfort are wonderful and all, but we can’t forget how recent this progress was made — and how volatile the public can be.
We make jokes every day targeting racial stereotypes, disabilities and gender — the list goes on. We let these jokes fly with a knowing wink of enlightenment, as though making them was a badge of hip post-tolerance. What we should be doing is proactively making steps toward political correctness and common verbal courtesy, not taking steps backward.
The media fosters this same style of reflexive politically incorrect irony (South Park, anyone?), and, of course, it sells. Believe me, I find it just as hysterical as the next person; look at Stephen Colbert or the comedic styling of writers at 30 Rock. Or perhaps you’re more jazzed about the satirical Broadway sensation Avenue Q, in which Gary Coleman gleefully proclaimed, “Everyone’s a little bit racist!”
But what they all plead for is a world that’s a whole lot less politically correct, which is supposedly something that can give way to cultural harmony. I’m not so optimistic.
Certainly it can be argued that we ought not to take ourselves so seriously — “sticks and stones”, etc. But I think that’s a fairly narrow-minded perspective. It’s excellent that in the last half-century we’ve made strides toward acceptance that hasn’t been present in Western world culture in a disturbingly long history. But we now have to take advantage of those advances. Its time to show some appreciation — the sincere kind — for the diversity by which we are surrounded, not view them only as a source of teenage humor. I have faith that ironies can be found elsewhere and they’ll be other self-deprecating laughs to come.
In the meantime, each time we start up a gag aimed at someone who is even the slightest bit different from the man in the mirror, we should keep in mind that the kid beside us might not be so ironically enlightened.
Allegra Tepper is a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism. Her column, “Talkin’ ‘Bout My Generation,” runs Tuesdays.
Some times the most effective medicine is the bitterest to swallow.
While my advice for Tepper may seem harsh, or angst fueled, it is not. It is intended to help. Sorry kids, but people use racy humor, especially in college. It has always been like this, and it always will be. Anything you may write on this page will not change that. 
Have fun trying to nibble at my arguments, but these efforts are lame and really only reinforce my main points. You all may not comprehend my points, but believe me, there are many people in the newsroom and outside of it who do, and they are enjoying this exchange. Many of my experienced journalist friends have enjoyed reading these responses and disguised pleas from the fragile freshman. They have researched and confirmed my assumptions, and have volunteered to respond, but I have held them back; it is obvious that she is not ready for that experience yet. One has to have thick skin and tenacity to survive as a journalist, and hopefully Tepper and her little friends will soon learn this.
 So for you all defenders, instead of getting into a huff, just relax, believe that Tepper is strong enough, breathe and take a hit of the Mary Jane. You may need it more then she does.
Little Donnie. I read your first commentary which was entertaining.  Your second is less so.  The article is about words that are expressions of bigotry or anger. Your second comment is filled with personal anger and bigotry toward those whom you suspect have been sheltered or privileged. I re-read the article twice looking for the references you say the author made -attempting to equate you to swastika wearing punk rockers. They are no where to be found in the actual article. In your attack on the writer or the writer’s style you are losing factual accuracy and making references to commentary rather than the actual article. You speak from a position of being the authority on “unsheltered” saying that they” develop a thick skin quickly” and are “glad to identify bigots”.  I can tell you this is not in fact the case.
How cute!
 it looks like Tepper has called all her little friends together to support her. I was expecting a few good points that possibly could have eroded my earlier argument, but if anything, their ramblings confirm and validate my initial assessment. 
One of my first points, was that her initial article was half baked. If you reread it, you will quickly find that she writes with many references and metaphors that are assumed and half fleshed out, a hodge-podge of ideas that are confusing because half of the points never make the journey from her brain to the screen. Most of the Daily Trojan has clear writing, but this article does not. I hope an editor takes her aside and helps her develop to the Trojan standard. Put her piece next to any other, and you will see a difference not in her favor. 
Another point that validates my assessment is that neither Tepper, nor her friends, deny their love of naughty humor on TV. In her article, Tepper only worries about how others could get hurt from this language, an insinuation that she is not rattled by it, but oh, the others without her experience and savy would be traumitized by such humor! This is part of her arrogance, which is in no doubt spawned from her indulgent and sheltered upbringing. The fact that she may be claiming to be from New York and California is more evidence of the correctness of my assumption, and validates my assessment. To be bi-coastal, is to be privileged, and to be privileged is to be sheltered. 
Sheltered kids are more likely to protected from hearing homophobic, racist and graphic language. Unsheltered kids grow up around this language and develop a thick skin quickly, and never cry about it like sheltered kids do, when they first hear it. It’s not even an issue, it’s something that is actually helpful to street kids. Harsh language reveals a lot about the people who use it, and unsheltered kids are glad to identify bigots, racists and weirdos, so that they can treat them accordingly. So Tepper, you and your friends have clearly exposed yourselves and your background. Thanks for confirming it ; )
Another part of my validation is that Tepper bears an arrogance that can only be forged from a spoiled and sheltered upbringing. This is also shown in the name of her column (Talking ’bout my Generation), as if she is an authority of the whole group, and not really just an authority of her own opinion. Does the whole Daily Trojan staff believe that Tepper is more of an expert on the students on campus then they are? Wow, either Tepper is a freshman with more savy and insight than the whole Daily Trojan Staff, or she is more arrogant. 
Her assumptions about this DT reader couldn’t be more wrong. Her attempt to equate me and other Trojans who don’t fret about naughty humor on campus, to swastika wearing punk rockers, is also hilarious. It smells of desperation. I hope she can clean up her act and humbly see these flaws in her work and focus her energies into improving her writing. As for her friends, well I understand that they had to support her with their half baked comments, but if they were real friends, they would tell her how to clarify and improve her argument instead of just coddling her pubescent outrage. I will acknowledge the wit of Little Donnie’s Mom, this was a clever if not hollow, rebuttal. Perhaps if Tepper hung out with her more, she could infuse her writing with such wit. 
Well, I hope these words help and heal, and even though the truth can heavy to bear, I believe that If Tepper chews upon my advice, she will improve and strengthen her writing style. Tepper, feel free to respond, but your energy would probably be better spent on your next article. 
I’ll be waiting and reading.
It’s fun to watch you summarily dismiss everything of substance in my comment in favor of spouting off more condescending but meaningless prattle. First of all, as it appears your reading comprehension skills are as lacking as your writing ability (and yet you deign to tell someone getting PAID for her words that you know her craft better than she does!), let me clarify this for you: I AM NOT ALLEGRA TEPPER. Yes, I KNOW Ms. Tepper (who, by the way, is professional enough to know better than to address your idiocy herself–since this is not my article, however, I am bound by no such rules of propriety), but we are different people with entirely different personal backgrounds, and that you choose to assume my comment came from her suggests that you really are entirely incapable of fathoming that encountering a person with a worldview different from your own could be anything other than a one-time fluke.
Please tell me whence you hail, my dear, aware, oh-so-enlightened Donnie. I will repeat myself: I come from New York. You might choose to call me bicoastal on the basis of my residence here at USC, but if that’s all it takes to be bicoastal then there are a bucket-ton of SC students FAR from “privileged” or “sheltered” who would qualify for the word. Back home, I myself live in a neighborhood my friends persist in referring to–in spite of my protestations–as “way ghetto”, so although I will freely acknowledge that I come from a relatively privileged background I find your dismissal of me as sheltered completely risible. YOUR privilege continues to show; you clearly don’t know diddly squat about how cultural baggage works.
You’re right about one thing: “unsheltered kids are glad to identify bigots, racists and weirdos, so that they can treat them accordingly.” Here I am identifying you as a bigot, and here I am treating you accordingly: by calling you on your BS.
Um…Little Donnie’s mom has got it going on.
In actuality, it’s Stacy’s mom who has it going on, but I appreciate the sentiment, dear.
You may join my family for freshly baked generic sugar cookies while we watch reruns of “Family Ties.”
This is a really important article.  Little Donnie is certainly comfortable making a lot of assumptions.  Little Donnie speaks of a muzzle.  Maybe he needs one.  Telling the writer she is suffering from liberal guilt or overly sheltered because she finds racism rearing its ugly little head in her world intolerable is absurd. Tepper deserves credit for pointing out a disturbing trend.
LITTLE DONNIES THE MAN WRECK SHIT HOMIE!!!
Little Donnie is making ridiculous generalizations. This is an awesome column. I don’t know if I agree with it, but it made me think. Good for you for writing what many people doubtless think but are afraid to say aloud.
Hmm, I think this article could have used a little more time in the oven before publishing. Tepper spends a lot of time trying to complicate an issue that is pretty simple. Basically, she is growing uncomfortable on campus because she is hearing a lot of racist, homophobic and dirty talk and she is worried about other people taking offense. This is called liberal guilt, and it sounds like Tepper has a belly full of it. Why? Probably because she enjoys the naughty humor, which is why she quotes it and cites it, but never fully attacks it.
Relax Tepper, breathe, things will be okay. I see you are a freshman, so this would explain your shock at being exposed to such edgy jokes. You probably came from a safe place, where your parents sheltered you from all the crazy things in life, and this new world on campus is giving you a little culture shock. Well, just so you know, this is common on all college campuses. It’s one of those things that happens in the tumultuous years of college. Using this language is a form of rebellion, and many young people enjoy saying such things because mom and dad aren’t around to muzzle them or shush them harshly. Actually, if you compared USC to other schools, it is pretty tame in the Non P.C.language department.
So now that you know that things are as they ought to be, relax, breathe, and if you are still feeling liberal guilt, you can always get a medical marijuana card.
Welcome to California ; )
Dear Little Donnie,
Before I make my point, I will take the liberty of informing you that I am from New York City and thus in fact probably had an upbringing exponentially less sheltered and more diverse than you did. The only culture shock I myself have experienced coming to USC has been inspired by the sheer number of whites, Christians, and other such people with privilege, so what I’m about to say certainly doesn’t come from a place of naivety–unless you’re counting naivety about how bigoted people with privilege can be.
I’m going to hazard the following guess: you are male, heterosexual, cisgendered, probably white, and possibly Christian. Whatever un-PC jokes you make with your friends probably include words you have never heard directed at you in a purely malicious (rather than “post-bigotry” or ironic) way. You have probably never experienced slurs at all, in fact, because you are steeped in privilege, which is exactly why you feel compelled to pull out BS phrases like “liberal guilt”–the idea of actually being held responsible for taking advantage of your privelege to make jokes at the expense of people who do not get to live their lives as oblivious to bigotry as you do terrifies you. There is a marked difference between a minority “reclaiming” an offensive word and a member of the majority that oppressed them with words like those in the first place trying to glom onto the repurposement of the epithet, and if you can’t see that I marvel that you were able to get into USC to begin with.
Using offensive words the destructive power of which you have never actually had to deal with yourself, just because you feel like being WILD AND EDGY!!!, strikes me as extremely similar to the manner in which punk-rockers of the 1970s bore swastikas not as emblems of their political ideologies but as “a form of rebellion”–blithely unaware or maybe just uncaring of the pain they could be causing others by doing so.
Let’s be real here, Ms. Keely. Donnie forgot to take his anti-ignorant and anti-dumbass pills the other morning. :( I forgot to remind him. I’m sorry he was so rude! He didn’t even pause to consider that the writer of the article may very well be from Los Angeles or – gasp – not have been brought up in a sheltered home like my Little Donnie was. 
Donnie, I expect you home at 6 o’clock tonight. We need to watch Fox News so we can be really well informed about the world.

The month of September is typically a time of adjustment for USC freshmen around campus.
For Haley Boysen, freshman midfielder for the women’s soccer team, and Jeremy Davies, freshman 2- meter player for the back-to-back NCAA champion men’s water polo team, this past weekend signified quite the opposite. Two of the Trojan family’s newest members put on a good old fashioned coming out party.
Boysen led USC women’s soccer to two victories in the Trojan Invitational over No.23 Auburn and NAU. On Friday night, she notched the match’s only goal in overtime to lead the team to a thrilling victory against the Tigers. And just two days later, she effortlessly took on the role of playmaker as she set up the Trojans first and third goals in a victory against the Lumberjacks.
But the spotlight Boysen thrived in the past few days was by no means a single act. Fellow-freshman Davie helped the Trojans win triumphantly against No.10 Long Beach State (16-4) and No.8 LMU (10-5). In both matchups, Davie led the team in goals, looking at ease en route to two hat tricks.
For Boysen’s and Davie’s efforts, the USC Credit Union named both as the Student-Athletes of the Week for the week of Sept. 6-12.

After sporting many unique and strange outfits at past VMAs, Lady Gaga didn’t fail to disappoint this year. When called onto stage to accept the Best Video of the Year for her song “Bad Romance,” Gaga shocked the audience by appearing in a dress, completed with hat, purse, and shoes, made out of meat.
Earlier in the month, Gaga was featured on the cover of Vogue in a bikini made of the same material and the photo shoot stirred up controversy with People for the Ethnical Treatment of Animals.
When asked about the meaning behind the meat dress, Gaga replied that its to demonstrate that “if we don’t stand up for what we believe in, and if don’t fight for our rights pretty soon we are going to have as much rights as the meat on our bones.”

Los Angeles police officials have been patrolling the streets of Downtown Los Angeles more heavily lately in an effort to deter outreach groups from giving donations to people living on Skid Row, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Skid Row, often referred to at the nation’s homeless capital, attracts many groups who look to aid the homeless population by providing food and clothing. However, some residents and business owners, in addition to city officials are growing increasingly concerned about community safety.
“These [groups] don’t know what happens when they leave,” Deon Joseph, Los Angeles Police Department senior lead officer and liaison to the community, told the L.A. Times. “We’ve had people get stabbed after fighting over clothes. We’ve had people get sick after eating their food. It’s just dangerous and irresponsible.”
This summer, several outreach groups received citations for not possessing a permit for distributing goods on the streets after Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jan Perry asked the Los Angeles County Department of Public Heath to enforce food saftey regulations more strictly.
Yet some activitsts find these regulations unreasonable for the homeless community.
“It would be literally impossible to meet all their requirements,” activist Michael Hubman told the L.A. Times.
As the community continues to change, three missions in Downtown Los Angeles — Union Rescue Mission, Los Angeles Mission and Midnight Mission — have offered outreach groups their facilities to distribute food and clothing to the community.

The USC Retired Faculty Association has awarded their Caldwell Scholarship to two freshmen recipients.
Pablo Escobar of Los Angeles and Francisco Iturbe Jr. of Huntington Park, both undeclared freshmen, will each receive $3,000 per year as part of the Russell Caldwell Neighborhood Scholarship Program.
The scholarship was created in 1966 as a neighborhood outreach program throughout the Los Angeles area. USC history and journalism professor Dr. Russell Caldwell began to collect funds from his fellow faculty members in order to provide scholarships for incoming students from local high schools.
The scholarship is granted to twelve USC students, each of whom receive $3,000 for each year of undergraduate education. The program is funded by the USC Retired Faculty Association, the LAS Office of Academic Relations, and the Emeriti Center College.
Continuing scholars include Shaveonte Graham, Natalie Guevara, Karen Martinez, Eva Ortega, Jazzmin Owens, Bertrad Perdomo and Jazmin Reyes.

Next time you’re about to study for an exam, try putting down that 20 oz. cup of coffee and the bottle of ADD medication. Instead, try walking. That’s right, a new Yahoo! article has reported a study that claims that walking not only limbers the aging body, but “keeps the mind supple as well.”
Increasing the connectivity between brain circuits, walking can improve memory, attention and other cognitive processes. Simply put, walking is likely more effective than you might expect.
“When we walk we integrate visual input, auditory input, as well as input that’s coming from joints and muscles regarding where the foot is, how much force, and things like that ” said Millar, a professor of Physical Therapy at Andrews University, in the Yahoo! News piece.
With a beautiful campus sprawled out among us, we should consider spending more time exploring its boundaries. So next time you walk to class, don’t take the shortcut. Instead, take the long route.

We’ve seen the comments from USC coach Lane Kiffin following his team’s lackluster 17-14 win over Virginia Saturday.
“[I am] really disappointed in our performance,” he told reporters after the game. “They outcoached us. We just had better players and made some plays. I hope you can tell the disappointment in our team and coaching staff. We’re not getting it done.”
Later, he went on to comment about the post-game atmosphere in the Trojan locker room.
“It’s probably the most miserable 2-0 locker room I’ve ever been in,” he said. “But that’s good, because it means the players understand our expectations and what we want from them.”
Only time will tell if the Trojans take the message to heart, but if Twitter is any indication, Kiffin’s team understood his point.
From senior center Kristofer O’Dowd (@ODOWD61):
“a WIN is a WIN but we can always get better!!! back to the Grind…2 down 11 to GO!!!!!!”
Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley (@MattBarkley):
“Learning and growing from your mistakes is the only way you can get better. Let’s be 1-0 this week..”
Sophomore safety T.J. McDonald (@tdeuce7):
“A win is a win. Get better every week. 11 more chances to do something special.”
But perhaps redshirt sophomore wide receiver Brice Butler (@USCnumber19) said it best at 11:31 p.m. Saturday:
“Too close.”
