The road has not been friendly for the Trojans this season, as they dropped their sixth consecutive away game Sunday night in an 87-65 loss to Cal at Haas Pavilion.
USC (19-10, 8-8) wraps up its road conference schedule with a 2-7 record and has dropped five of its last six games. Meanwhile, the Bears (21-9, 11-5) finish the season a perfect 18-0 at home.
“We can’t afford to play like that anymore,” junior guard Julian Jacobs said of the road struggles. “It’s ridiculous. It’s the same thing every single time. It’s very frustrating. It’s the same game. It’s basketball – same hoop, same ball. Whatever it is, we’re mental midgets on the road.”
Junior forward Nikola Jovanovic was the lone bright spot for the Trojans. Jovanovic had 21 points and nine rebounds, but only he and Jacobs – who finished with 11 points – scored in double figures.
The Trojans started off with great energy on defense and on the boards as Jovanovic was highly efficient inside, going 7-of-8 from the field in the first half for 14 points. With USC down four, freshman center Chimezie Metu recorded two blocks that each led to layups on the other end. A putback by Jovanovic followed to give the Trojans a 14-11 lead at the 13:52 mark of the first half and the game was tied at 26-26 midway through the first half.
“We played hard in the beginning of the game,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “It was 26-all. We were defending, rebounding, pushing the ball. We got good looks at the basket.”
But the Trojans went cold the remainder of the half, going on a scoring drought that lasted nearly seven minutes as the Bears went on a 14-0 run to take a 40-26 lead. To wrap up the half, Cal freshman forward Jaylen Brown went coast-to-coast in 3.8 seconds and finished at the rim, a fitting end to a frustrating first 20 minutes of play.
“All of a sudden, they kept making shots and we stopped,” Enfield said. “That was the difference in the game. You can’t get down double-digits at Cal and expect to win.”
USC trailed 44-30 at halftime and like the loss against Stanford on Thursday night, never threatened in the second half as the Bears built a 20-plus point advantage. Cal wound up shooting 48 percent as Brown and fellow freshman Ivan Rabb led the way with 18 points each.
The Bears made 10 3-pointers while the Trojans struggled despite getting quality shots, which, for whatever reason, led to issues on the defensive end of the floor.
“We pretty much got whatever we wanted,” Jacobs said. “We just didn’t finish. A lot of shots went in and out. Whenever we don’t make shots, it translates to poor defense. That was the name of the game. We just couldn’t guard.”
Coming into the night, USC had allowed its past four opponents to shoot at a combined 49.3 percent clip.
The Trojans drop to .500 in conference play and are tied with Oregon State and Stanford for sixth in the Pac-12 conference. They wrap up their season with a pair of home games this week against Oregon State and Oregon.
“It’s not looking too good for us,” Jacobs said. “We definitely need to regroup, and we really need these two games at home.”

Despite riding the No. 9 team in the country tightly for most of Friday night, USC walked away from the weekend with two losses to Arizona State and Arizona.  
Mistakes in the final minutes of the ASU game and a slow start against Arizona gave the Trojans a tough final weekend in the Galen Center.
“It was a difficult and disappointing weekend for our program going into tournament play,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “We did not play [Sunday] the way we know our team is capable. Players have to show up ready to play in order for us to win.”
The weekend opened against Arizona State, a top-10 ranked team that USC had already challenged once this season. It wasn’t a game of offense but rather a high-intensity matchup of two physical defenses hungry to prove their dominance. It was the type of night where every missed basket or sloppy foul felt like it could cost the game. 
The first half was a triumph for the Trojans defense as they held ASU to a total of 16 points. The defense locked down both at the 3-point line and in the paint to force the Sun Devils to earn points intermittently off free throws and rebounds. 
Although they kept pace with the Trojans, ASU was unable to settle into an offense and score off of set plays throughout the first half. They shot only 27 percent from the floor and were 0-for-4 from the 3-point line. Meanwhile, the Trojans shot only a little better at 28 percent and struggled from the free throw line, but aggressive post play from sophomore Kristen Simon and senior Temi Fagbenle kept the team alive and competitive against the Sun Devils.
ASU pulled ahead by seven points, but the team battled back through consistent defense and a tight team chemistry. When Jaco missed a light pass from Simon with under six minutes left to play, Simon grabbed her point guard’s hand and patted her on the waist, shouting encouragements over the referee’s whistle. On the next play, Jaco stole the ball and drove it in for a layup. The play after that, she drew a foul and sank both free throws to bring the score back within 3.
After jockeying back and forth for several plays, the game came down to the wire, with USC trailing by two points. With 30 seconds left, Fagbenle was fed a wide-open layup and took her shot, but the ball ricocheted short and into ASU hands. Despite fouling, the Trojans took their second last-second loss of the season to the Sun Devils.
The weekend’s second game was not any easier for the Trojans as they faced up against Arizona. The Wildcats had similarly struggled throughout this season’s conference play, but by outshooting the Trojans twice as much in the second quarter, created a sizable lead that could not be overcome.
In the first half of the game, the Trojans allowed Arizona to shoot 51 percent, notching 26 points in the second quarter alone and only responding with 11. The slow defensive start allowed Arizona to get out to a 38-22 lead in the first half.
The second half saw an improved balance in both offense and defense, as the team slowed Arizona’s shooting to 34 percent and steadily outshot the Wildcats. Jaco in particular came alive in the final quarter, knocking down consecutive 3s and leading a relentless press to bring the team within two points in the final five minutes. But after Fagbenle fouled out of the game, the team struggled to find their offensive rhythm and fell behind to a seven-point deficit and losing 63-56. 
Up next for the Women of Troy, who finish the season 18-12 overall and 6-12 in conference play, is the Pac-12 tournament in Seattle. They will take on Washington State in the first round on Thursday.   
“That fourth quarter is what Trojan basketball looks like,” Jaco said. “We just didn’t have it early enough. But I think, as a team, we know what we’re capable of, and that’s the type of play we’ll be bringing into the tourney.”

The USC Historically Black College and University exchange program, sponsored by the USC Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, allows students to spend a semester at a historically black college or university for an abroad experience different from those generally offered by the University. Black students are able to attend many of the top HBCUs around the country including Spelman College and Howard University, allowing them an experience they simply cannot find at USC.
Since the Higher Education Act of 1965, HBCUs have been recognized as institutions dedicated to the education of African American students. The 105 nationally recognized HBCUs, which represent only 3 percent of the nation’s colleges and universities, graduate nearly 20 percent of African Americans who earn undergraduate degrees, and 27 percent of all STEM field degrees for black students.
USC’s exchange program addresses a distinct issue with diversity and inclusion at the university. Elle Anderson, a senior majoring in business administration, found a home away from home when she attended Howard University during the fall of her junior year.
“What made me want to do it was just the fact that I’m from Tennessee, so I’m not actually from California, and I guess going to a PWI — a predominantly white institution — I guess I just felt a little out of touch and needed a break from USC for a while,” she said. “Howard is a lot closer to my home, a lot closer to my family, and it was my equivalent of going abroad.”
Though most modern universities emphasize and celebrate diversity, PWIs by their very nature have difficulty creating an environment of genuine inclusion. The HBCU exchange program not only allows students a unique experience outside of Southern California, but also gives them a better sense of belonging.
“It was like being in a different atmosphere and environment altogether, because not only was it D.C. versus LA, but at Howard, for once I felt like I was just a student, not necessarily a black student or minority student at school,” Anderson said. “I just came back with a better understanding of myself as a black American and black student.”
Dionna Walker, a senior majoring in business administration, also studied at Howard at the height of protests regarding the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police.
“In the heat of the Mike Brown controversy and the Eric Garner ‘I can’t breathe’ protests, when all that was happening, it was good to be in an environment where you don’t feel personally attacked,” Walker said. “Even when there were different opinions about how things should be handled or the real issues at play, everyone was interested in being involved in the discussion.”
Though the exchange program gives black students a much-needed and often unforgettable opportunity, issues regarding credit transfer and graduating on time prevent some students from attending the program. Study abroad programs are notorious for forcing students to decide between taking their required classes and having an abroad experience, but the University’s lack of recognition of the HBCU exchange program credits further detracts from an important opportunity offered to black students.
“They sent out an email to black students advertising the program, and, surprisingly, they didn’t get a lot of responses because a lot of people didn’t have credits that would transfer between Howard and USC,” Anderson said. “I think there could be more transparency and communication between the programs.”
Walker even had to drop her minor as a result of attending the program.
“I’m a business major, theater minor, and took all my theater upper divisions over there, and they all came back as three units rather than four, and they all came back as general electives, rather than theater upper divisions,” she said. “USC did not do a lot of work fixing that or working with me on that, and so I’m dropping my minor.”
Issues regarding credit transfer, however, should not prevent students from applying. Attending college at an HBCU, Walker said, is an invaluable and significant experience for black students.
“It’s an experience everybody should have,” Walker said. “It was awesome.”

As the most recent addition to the schools at USC, the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance has filled the University’s void for performance art, thus bringing the community of artists full circle. Aside from its private sphere of influence, Kaufman has raised the standards for college dance programs nationwide. Claiming its title as the first conservatory style program at a private research university, the school cultivates their students’ artistic and academic growth at an elite level.
On Feb. 26 and 27, the Kaufman School of Dance put on its spring midterm showings, titled “Works in Progress.” The two performances showcased the dancers magnificently through the presentation of student choreography, as well as pieces set by the faculty. Both performances took place in PED 207, the large dance studio in the Physical Education Building in which the dancers practice in daily.
The first student choreography showing took place on Friday at 3:30 pm. This singular performance captured various highly innovative students through the presentation of their choreography. At the beginning of the semester, students who wanted to choreograph a piece began their choreographic processes.
“A lot of choreographers had visions for their pieces and contacted who they thought would fit the vision they had … It was a very casual process. Everyone that wanted to make one could make one. The ones that weren’t ready weren’t showcased,” said Justin Epstein, a freshman majoring in dance.
Independently choosing rehearsal times and spaces, the student choreographers had full control of their pieces. This independence resulted in a wholly encompassing show, covering the dancers’ fluency in movement and the choreographers’ sense of direction, formation and overall aesthetics. Each piece held itself to a high standard, demonstrating “the new movement” through the dancers’ superb performance in the intimate studio setting.
All 14 of the dance works from Friday’s showing were incredible. Three of these pieces — “manly-ish” by Austyn Rich, “On and Up” by Sophia Oddi and “Le Grand Pas” by Justin Epstein — were featured in one of the Saturday night performances. Other distinguished pieces include Jordan Johnson’s “Sons & Daughters,” Alyssa Allen’s “Dying Star,” Ardyn Flynt and Helen Gratch’s “This is a Dance” and Madison Vomastek’s “Someday Girl.”
The Repertory Works in Progress took place on Saturday with three showings. Among the collection of master choreographers presented were Paul Taylor, Jiří Kylián and Kaufman’s artistic advisor, William Forsythe. Each performance had a different cast which constituted a diverse representation of the dancers and the choreography. Out of the four pieces shown, two were set in the fall semester and premiered at their December show, “Groundwork,” whereas the other two were recently set and had their debut performances.
Although the repertory works were beautifully executed by the dancers, Epstein commented on the drawbacks of performing in-studio.
“I feel like it’s harder to give the audience the full sense of the magnificence of the pieces that were created … Especially since Lickety Split and Cloven Kingdom have so much lighting in them. So it’s a full experience in the theater, and we don’t really get to give that to the audience in the studio, and the stage is bigger, so we have more to play with. We kind of get squished in here,” Epstein remarked.
Regardless of these disadvantages, the pieces were truly breathtaking. The dancers’ passionate execution of the pieces authenticated the movement. Every step seamlessly flowed together, revealing the countless hours spent training and rehearsing. Confident yet humble and expressive yet mature, the dancers’ movement was full of conviction. This earnestness allowed the audience to be active viewers while simultaneously enacting on their fantasies.
There is truly something to be said about the students’ ability to perform so effortlessly in an intimate setting. The last piece of the four set by the faculty, Lickety Split, fittingly closed the show. Performed by three pairs of boy-girl couples, this piece expressed the romantic connection between each couple, thus ending the show on a heartfelt note. Nowhere else in the world, throughout the duration of this final piece, could compare to the love present in the room.
Helen Gratch, a freshan majoring in dance, echoes the warmth so eminently portrayed in Lickety Split.
“I think most people perceive the dance world as being so brutal, mean and competitive, but it really doesn’t have to be. All of the guest teachers we’ve had have remarked how they’ve never been in such a positive environment. We’ve become such a tight knit community while still pushing each other in the right ways without knocking each other down,” Gratch said.
For those who missed these shows, additional performances through Kaufman include its end-of-year performances on April 28 and 29 in Bing Theatre.

The Trojan Dance Marathon held its eighth annual event, “Dancing Through Time,” in partnership with the Children’s Miracle Network to show support and raise money for the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Volunteers danced from 2 p.m. on Saturday to 2 a.m. Sunday morning in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom, supported by donations.
Actor Clayton Snyder, most known for his role as Ethan Craft from Lizzie McGuire, delivered the opening remarks. Various dance groups performed throughout the night including USC Ballroom, USC Street Dance Society and the Trojan Marching Band. Miracle Children, or former CHLA patients who have survived cancer, other diseases, or accidents also shared their experiences with CHLA at the dance marathon, and some even performed as well.
“What makes Dance Marathon such a special event is the moment where everyone gets together and they are listening to these kids talk and their parents talk because they know that they are here for the kids,” said Christine Nguyen, CHLA coordinator for Dance Marathon. “CHLA is one of the most special places in the world, not only because of the amazing medical work that they do, but because they want to make kids still feel like kids, not patients.”
Throughout the night, people danced for the Miracle Children and their families and showed their support by getting involved in their stories. Amirah Dales, internal director for Dance Marathon, said that she wanted to increase awareness about Dance Marathon in order to get more people involved.
“I just wish that more people knew about Dance Marathon at USC and join this event and see how much of an impact that could be on the children’s life at CHLA,” Dales said. “My hope for Dance Marathon is to spread the word out more and get more people involved in philanthropy on campus.”
Charlie Henriquez, finance director for Dance Marathon, has been on the planning committee for three years and had high expectations going into the event given USC’s success with the event in past years.
“It was great to see how we were raising more and more money every year. The dance marathon is a huge thing in the East Coast, and USC has been leading the DM on the West Coast,” Henriquez said.
Trojan Dance Marathon was founded in 2008. There are about 40 members in total, four directors and an internal as well as an external team, who put up various fundraisers like Insomnia Cookies, a Blood Drive and Pie for a Life throughout the year, as well as the actual dance marathon to fundraise for CHLA.
Most of the money was raised by the dancers through the online portal called Donor Drive.
Allen Alvarado, a former Miracle Child who was injured in a car accident almost nine years ago, performed with his band at the event and said that CHLA helped him recover in many ways.
“In CHLA they have doctors and nurses who feel like family,” Alvarado said. “It’s really important because every hospital can heal you on the outside, but the doctors and nurses at CHLA really helped me heal from the inside.”
Allen has been associated with CHLA ever since his accident, and has been working with Extra Life LA to help raise funds for the hospital. He finished his associate’s degree at the Musicians Institute and has been coming to the dance marathon for six years.
“I have been part of the USC Dance Marathon and for any events and anything else they need,” Alvarado said. “I am there for them 100 percent.”
Eileen Garrido, another Miracle Child who sang at the event, explained how excited she was to be at the dance marathon.
“This is my seventh year at the dance marathon. I have been coming here since I was a little girl and it’s getting better and better every year,” Garrido said. She explained that CHLA gave her a new life, and she started the Beating Hearts Foundation that helps raise money for the hospital.
In the concluding hours, The Doryan award, which was named after brain cancer victim Doryan Torres Carrillo, was presented to Alpha Phi for raising the most money, and the last hour from 1 to 2 p.m. was the power hour, where dancers hoped to raise $1,000 an hour. In the closing ceremony, it was announced that the total money raised this year was $33,687.97.

Children from the surrounding neighborhood gathered in the Von Kleinsmid Center courtyard Saturday for Chalk the Block, an annual event in which local schoolchildren ages five to 13 participate in an art competition.
The children were given artist’s paper taped to the sidewalk, different colored chalk and 45 minutes to draw their dreams. Live music, games and food were also present as the children drew while parents and volunteers supervised.
“We noticed that a lot of kids in the surrounding area drop out of school as they get older, and it can be very hard for them to realize that they can chase their dreams, so what we’re trying to do is inspire them to believe in themselves and their dreams,” said junior Magdalini Vraila, a member of Chalk the Block’s planning and media team. “When we ask these kids what they want to do or who they want to become, they realize that their dreams are important.”
At the awards ceremony, the children were divided into age brackets, and each student received one of four awards: the Visionary Award, for having a big dream and executing it well throughout the chalking period; the Color Wonder Award, given to a child for using many colors in his or her art piece; the Creativity Award, for showing innovation; or the Dedication Award, given to a child for refusing to give up even when the artwork got difficult, seeing his or her dreams through until the end.
“My dream is to become a scientist and invent stuff,” fourth-grader and Visionary Award winner Karina Barbosa said. “I drew a scientist, which is me, putting a little drop into a potion to make a bunny ultra-sized.”
Barbosa’s mother, Marina Ceja, discussed the importance of encouraging interaction between USC and the local community.
“I think it’s very important to have an event like this because it encourages kids from communities that are not as privileged to go to college and follow their dreams,” Ceja said.
Chalk the Block started three years ago when USC student Harleen Marwah noticed the great discrepancy between USC, an elite research university, and the poverty of nearby areas. She also noticed that whereas USC graduates nearly 90 percent of its senior class every year, 27,380 students dropped out of school during the 2010-2011 school year in the South LA community. By creating Chalk the Block, she hoped to bridge the gap between the resources the university offers and the help that neighborhood kids need.
One of the most striking barriers between USC and the LA community are the gates surrounding campus that act as physical and symbolic barriers, according to Director of Chalk the Block Claire Chatinover.
“The gates show the community around us that we don’t want them on our campus,” Chatinover said. “What is amazing about this campus is that it grows so much through interaction with the local community, and the local community grows so much from us. I think the important thing to know is that although these gates are up, we can still utilize the times they are open to show the community that we want to build lasting relationships.”
Chalk the Block has been highlighted as the “activity of the month” by the National Association of College and University Residence Halls and has been implemented on other college campuses.
According to Marwah’s essay on Chalk the Block’s website, “Chalk the Block encourages people to think beyond their boundaries. University students are asked to look beyond the perimeter of campus and share a common space to discover the ‘common ground’. Chalkateers are challenged to dream as big as they possibly can, looking past other obstacles in their lives.”

The Associated Students of Biomedical Engineering hosted the first ever Make-a-thon at USC to provide students in the biomedical field with real-life, application-based challenges. The competition, which spanned a period of over 30 hours from Feb. 26 to Feb. 28, had the students working in teams in order to solve a time-sensitive case.
The teams had to develop a solution to address the incidence of musculoskeletal injuries during missions in space while considering necessary material and functional constraints of payload size and weight, medical knowledge of diagnosis and application and the existing treatment of casting and splinting.
“We wanted the students to have a hands-on experience on developing real time devices,” said Shira Bernard, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering and one of the event organizers. “This is the first time that this event is happening at USC, and we are very excited.”
Fourteen teams of over 75 students participated in the event. Two of these teams were made up of students from visiting schools. The event started at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center with a formal introduction to the problem by Tianna Shaw, project manager for multi-disciplinary teams at NASA Ames Research Center. Shaw, who holds a dual bachelor’s degree in biomedical and electrical engineering from USC, emphasized that the limited size of spacecraft makes it difficult to fit all medical resources.
“Your role as biomedical engineers is extremely important. The future of a whole variety of activities at NASA depends a lot on the modern advancement in medical field,” Shaw said to students. “We have had many injuries in the space in the past, and now we are looking at … designing miniaturized versions of biomedical instruments that would fit in a space lab.”
On Saturday, the teams brainstormed, made functional requirements and created the prototype design for the medical device with Computer Aided Design tools. On the basis of prototypes, five top teams were selected for a chance to utilize USC’s Fabrication Lab to construct their designs from a variety of materials and methods.
During the competition, corporate representatives and USC professors mentored students. The teams were excited to work on their designs through the entire night for the final check-in presentation on Sunday.
Craig Western, mechanisms designer for manned space vehicles and a member of the Viterbi School of Engineering’s Emerging Leader’s Board, delivered the keynote to the students in which he talked about creativity and innovation being the key attributes of the modern engineer.
“Build things and build them fast,” Western said. “Taking your ideas and turning them into something real is the key to being successful.”

The last time the USC women’s swimming and diving team won a conference championship, most of the current swimmers’ and divers’ parents were still in high school. The year was 1985 — a year before the then-Pacific 10 began recognizing women’s athletics — when the Trojans swam their way to the Western Collegiate Athletic Association title.
Just over three decades later, the Trojans are conference champions once again.
Led by solid veteran leadership and explosive young talent, the No. 4 USC women’s swimming and diving team beat the odds to defeat Stanford, the nation’s top-ranked team; Cal, the defending conference and NCAA champions, as well as six other teams to capture the crown. A year after the men’s swimming and diving team won their first conference championship in 36 years, head coach Dave Salo understood the impact that the win had on not only this team but the entire Trojan family that they represent.
“There is nothing better than making Trojan alumni and fans proud of their Trojans,” Salo said. “The drought of team championships is over for USC.”
Historically, USC has boasted several outstanding individual swimmers but hasn’t been able to put together the team effort it takes to win a collective title. That script was flipped this year, as the Trojans — despite only winning three events — won the championship by over one hundred total points.
USC, who finished third in the 2015 Pac-12 Championships, posted a total of 1481 points. They were followed by No. 1 Stanford, who scored 1344, and No. 6 California, with 1306. From there, the gaps between schools widened: Arizona came in fourth with 1125 points, and UCLA, Utah, Washington State, Arizona State and Oregon State all finished with fewer than 1000 total points.
One of USC’s individual winners, junior swimmer Chelsea Chenault, was there when the Trojans fell short of their goal last season.
“It’s just an awesome experience to be the first team to ever win the Pac-12 Championship for our school,” Chenault said. “We’ve just been so strong, we’ve been fighting on this whole year.”
Chenault was the individual winner in the 500-yard freestyle on Thursday evening, and freshman Elizabeth Stinson went the distance on Saturday night to win the 1650-yard freestyle. They would be the only two Trojans to win their individual events.
“Nothing is more satisfying than a team championship, especially when it was as balanced as this was,” Salo said. “No one star propelled this. It was everyone taking responsibility and making a contribution.”
USC’s other team victory came in the 800-yard freestyle relay on the first night of the championships, when the quartet featuring freshmen Kirsten Vose and Allie Wooden, and juniors Anika Apostalon and Chenault obliterated the school record with a time of 6:55.17. Their finish in the 800 free was good for an NCAA “A” cut time and is currently the nation’s top time in the event this year.
While the Trojans certainly deserve to celebrate after their first-ever Pac-12 conference title, they won’t have long to relax. The NCAA Championships begin in mid-March at Georgia Tech, and with the confidence the team has built up after winning the conference title, it wouldn’t be surprising to see them in position to compete for their first national championship since 1997.
“The lesson learned throughout this championship was that when we put our mind to something we can get it done,” Salo said. “But at this point, winning the Pac-12 championship was one of those events that can transform a team not just for the immediate NCAA championship but for many championships we may face over the next several years.”
With only ten graduating seniors on the roster of 34 swimmers and divers — including fifteen talented freshmen — this may not be the last time we see the Trojans at the top of their conference in the near future.
Most exciting swim meet I have ever attended. Best Athletes! Best Coaches! Best School! Fight On!
wow, so proud!!

The top-ranked women’s water polo team traveled to Irvine to compete in the UC Irvine Invitational on Saturday and Sunday. USC faced three top-25 opponents on their way to the championship game against No. 2 UCLA Sunday night.
In Sunday’s semifinal game, the Women of Troy (10-0) faced No. 4 Stanford. USC took a quick first quarter lead of 2-1 but would fail to score again until the final period. Stanford led by 2 goals at halftime and extended the lead to 3 goals with one period of play left.
In an action-packed fourth quarter, the game was tied 6-6 with under a minute remaining when junior driver Stephania Haralabidis scored the winning goal on a lob with six seconds remaining.
The leading scorer for the Women of Troy was the other Haralabidis, junior attacker Ioanna, who had 2  goals in the game.
The action started Saturday with the Trojans rematch against No. 25 CSU Northridge. The Trojans dominated the Matadors 13-3 before challenging the host team No. 9 UC Irvine in a battle for the books.
In the opening match of the tournament, the Matadors were the first to put a goal on the board with an early lead. The Women of Troy would then go on to score the next 10 goals shutting out the Matadors for the remainder of the first half.
Ioanna Haralabidis put away 3 goals from the perimeter and junior center Brigitta Games tallied two more from the two-meter position. The momentum continued in the second quarter when junior Avery Peterson backhanded her second goal of the match.
The goaltending duties during the game were split between sophomore Victoria Chamorro and senior Alegra Hueso. Chamorro tallied five saves while Hueso recorded one in the match.
In the second half, USC continued to build on its lead drawing it out to a 13-2 lead in the fourth quarter. CSUN scored on their final powerplay opportunity to end the game, and the Trojans advanced to the next round with a 13-3 victory.
Facing host UCI in the next game, the Trojans were stuck in a back-and-forth battle that included seven ties. Sophomore driver Brianna Daboub scored 2 goals in the game with one coming in the first quarter to give them a 4-3 advantage at the end of the period. At the end of the first half the game was tied 5-5.
Stephania Haralabidis was the scoring force for USC in the game though netting a total of 7 goals. She scored the go-ahead goal with just under five minutes remaining in the game, and the Trojans held on to advance to the semifinals with an 11-10 victory.
Freshman goalie Amanda Longan stood tall in goal garnering 10 saves on the day.
USC will continue its season with a road trip to the desert to face ASU on March 5.

As a whole, the USC athletics department is flourishing. Great teams, good coaching hires and a constant flow of national titles all do well to strengthen the overall athletic brand. Couple that with an incredible state-of-the-art facility in the McKay Center and the natural attraction of Los Angeles, it is easy to see why USC attracts top flight talent in virtually every sport.
While there is incredible breadth and depth in the Trojan athletic roster of teams, the so-called two “television teams,” have experienced well-documented struggles over the past few years. The basketball team is certainly on an upswing, ignoring the recent slump, but by and large over the last half decade neither the basketball nor football program have been a consistent contender in their respective sports.
Finally, after sanctions and a dearth of talent for the basketball team, it looks like both programs are in a prime position to ascend back the rankings and vie for top billing. USC has never been a basketball school and probably never will be, but the team can attract a crowd and national prominence as it did during the mini renaissance of the program under Tim Floyd. If the basketball team could maintain their status as a consistent contender for trips to March Madness, that would really enhance the team’s profile.
Under Enfield, that looks like a plausible scenario. The Trojans certainly have their weaknesses, especially inside, and recruiting some stronger, more physical post players could help remedy that situation. They are arriving way ahead of schedule. With another talented recruiting class on the way, it looks as if Enfield is a solid enough coach to ensure that the Trojans will be viable contenders.
Additionally, high school players love the Slam City mentality. Running and gunning is fun and exciting for prospects, and even if USC doesn’t recruit top-10 talent, they are able to still land elite level commitments who need to take more than a year to develop. This adds consistency and stability to a team’s progress over a longer period of time. Outside of Duke and Kentucky, which unfortunately USC will probably never rival on the hardwood, the best formula for success seems to be an offshoot of what Enfield is doing in terms of his recruiting style.
Now, an argument can be made that a defensive-driven approach, like Tony Bennett at Virginia, is more effective, but I’m not sure if there is a definitive answer in that debate. As long as USC can continue to bring in solid talent and develop them like they have with junior guard Julian Jacobs, sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin and junior forward Nikola Jovanovic, they will be able to utilize their brand and the city of Los Angeles to their advantage.
In contrast, USC football is a different story. Expectations are inherently low for the basketball team. That couldn’t be further from the truth when it comes to football. Questionable hires, sanctions and a failure to properly develop talent have all left the Trojans sputtering the last few years on the football field. There have been a few highlights here and there, but for the most part, the Trojan football squads have failed to live up the expectations thrust upon a historically elite program.
Hopefully with sanctions in the rearview mirror, and a stable coaching situation USC can reclaim their status as a dominant player in the college football landscape. Another full, talented recruiting class should help matters as will a renovated Coliseum in the coming years.
Fans for the most part care a lot more about football than basketball, but as someone who is deeply passionate about both, it would be great to see two elite teams coming out of USC. Both coaches are young and intelligent and have demonstrated flashes of immense potential. There is nothing stopping them both from building powerhouse programs and reinvigorating the fan bases of both programs.
There is nothing quite like “We Are SC” chants at the end of big victories in football and basketball. The more of those, the merrier. As USC enters the second half of this decade it would be great if their trajectory projects closer toward an abundance of chants and less toward complaints about the failed potential of two teams with incredible resources.

Jake, you picked the wrong time to praise the athletic dept. Basketball has become pretty lame recently. Women program is lost almost entirely. Men Volleyball is in a sad state. Women Tennis has disintegrated while Men has become middle of the road. Football of course is way down at this time with a lot to prove next season. You forgot to mention Sand ( Beach ) Volleyball which is the only national title in 2015. Coaching hires are definitely debatable as to greatness or even very good under AD Haden. Track and Field seems to have prospered under new leadership even though Coach Smith-Gilbert is a former ‘ruin. This is not the 60’s/ 70’s when titles reigned in bunches while facilities were very avg. During the Pete Carroll era there was better results with more energy around the different  playing avenues of sports.

The baseball team welcomed Wake Forest to Dedeaux Field this weekend, and the Trojans nabbed their first series win of the season to push their record above .500.
The No. 21 Trojans took down the Demon Deacons 2-1 in the three-game series winning the first one 9-4 before dropping a 4-5 loss on Saturday. USC finished strong though with a 2-1 performance Sunday afternoon.
The team still sat even with a 3-3 record  when Sunday rolled around for the series finale. Senior Brent Wheatley took the mound, and the right-hander locked horns with Wake Forest sophomore Drew Loepprich in a pitchers duel. Wheatley turned in six strong innings of work, scattering one run, three hits and two walks throughout while striking out six batters, and the Trojans and Demon Deacons remained knotted at one run apiece through the top of the eighth inning.
USC finally broke the deadlock in the bottom of the eighth. Senior outfielder David Oppenheim drew a one-out walk and redshirt junior Reggie Southall was put in as a pinch-runner. He promptly swiped second base and moved to third on a ground ball from junior catcher Jeremy Martinez, and Oppenheim scored on a wild pitch to push the Trojans in front. A clean inning from senior closer Marc Huberman sealed a 2-1 USC win and the team’s first series win of the season.
Head coach Dan Hubbs praised his players’ fighting spirit when facing a pitcher who was on his game.
“I was proud of them for grinding out a game,” Hubbs said. “We put up some runs over the first two days, and then we showed we could win a 2-1 game.”
After a tough outing to begin his season last weekend, Wheatley said he took a simplified approach into Sunday’s start, and it paid dividends.
“I had a different mentality,” he said. “I was just trying to throw hard and make good pitches.”
Two games led up to Sunday’s deciding contest. Senior pitcher Kyle Davis toed the rubber for the Trojans to kick off the series on Friday, and the veteran right-hander turned in seven strong innings, however, he allowed four runs in a sloppy fifth inning. Martinez and freshman centerfielder Lars Nootbaar had big nights at the plate as the USC bats backed up their ace in a 9-4 win.
“We saw the fastball a lot, and we took advantage of it,” Nootbaar said.
Martinez, who smashed his first home run of the season on Friday, also tipped his hat to associate head coach Matt Curtis for preparing the offense for the Demon Deacons’ pitchers.
“Give a lot of credit to coach Curtis,” Martinez said. “We had a scouting report … so I was just trying to stay inside, put a good swing, and [the ball] just happened to run right into my barrel.”
Junior pitcher Bernardo Flores started game two, and like Davis the night before, fought through one tough inning but was sharp otherwise, allowing four runs across six frames of work. Flores left the game with the score knotted at four thanks to a game-tying solo shot from sophomore third baseman Adalberto Carrillo— his second of the season. Redshirt junior Joe Navilhon replaced Flores and struck out the side in order in his first inning of relief.
After cruising through two innings, however, Navilhon ran into trouble in the top of the ninth. The right-hander made an errant throw to first base on a leadoff bunt attempt, and freshman first baseman Dillon Paulson dropped the throw from Carrillo on the subsequent sacrifice bunt.
Senior pitcher Brooks Kriske then entered the game to try to put out the fire, but Martinez fired a low throw past Carrillo trying to pick off the runner at third, scoring the go-ahead run. The Trojans committed three errors in one inning and were unable to rally in the bottom of the ninth, dropping a 4-5 contest to set up Sunday’s deciding game.
Although he was disappointed with the ninth inning fiasco, Hubbs said it shouldn’t have come down to that at all.
“That’s not where the game was lost,” Hubbs said. “The game was lost when we left 14 guys on base. We had all sorts of opportunities to score a lot of runs, and we didn’t.”
It is still early in the season, however, and Hubbs said his squad, carrying high expectations, just needed to settle down.
“A lot of guys did some good things,” Hubbs said. “We just have to have some guys be able to relax in the moment and get it done.”
Next up, the Trojans hit the road on Tuesday for a tough tilt against Long Beach State before a weekend that includes hosting Oklahoma and Mississippi State as well as the annual game against UCLA at Dodger Stadium on Sunday.

For the past seven years, the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs has offered an alternative to tanning on a beach or hitting the slopes for spring break — an opportunity to visit the most vital landmarks of the civil rights movement.
This spring break, 20 students and advisers will travel to five cities in Georgia and Alabama on a trip organized by CBCSA associate director Rosalind Conerly and Marshall School of Business graduate student Yasmin Scott. There, they will gain hands-on experience with black history and the present condition of black people in the South.
For the students on the trip, traveling to the South is an introduction to a completely new way of life. For many, it is their first trip on a plane. Everything about the culture of the South — from the stereotypical Southern hospitality to soul food — comes as a shock for students who have never been to the Cotton Belt.
This culture shock, according to Conerly, is an important part of a trip meant to open the eyes of students to both the past and the present experience of black Americans.
“It’s an incredible trip because there is so much for students to take in and process at once,” Conerly said. “They’re looking at how far we’ve come from and, at the same time, the fact that there is so much work to be done. I think it’s really a very moving week for all of us.”
The trip begins in Atlanta, where the group will visit the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, the King Center and the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached.
Then the group will travel to Birmingham and to Selma, where they will visit a variety of civil rights museums, centers and landmarks, including the Edmund Pettus Bridge and the Brown Chapel.
The next three days will encompass the service portion of the trip. For two days, students will work in local schools in Selma and Montgomery. They will also spend a day working with the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit that provides free legal representation to defendants and prisoners.
Founded and led by acclaimed lawyer Bryan Stevenson, the Initiative will provide a chance for the USC students on the trip to get a hands-on look at how the color of one’s skin can still affect justice.
“It’s interesting because the students see how people are still being jailed, they’re still being oppressed and there are still people in the South having to fight every day to do something about it,” Scott said. “It’s eye-opening.”
The final leg of the trip takes place at Tuskegee University, a prominent black college, before returning to Atlanta.
Each night of the trip, Conerly makes sure that students have the opportunity to meet USC alumni who have moved or returned to the South. She believes it is an important part of connecting to both the history of the civil rights and to the current lifestyle of many Southern black communities.
There are two major reasons that the CBCSA travels to the South every spring. One is to see where the South is now, to see a way of life still steeped in both racism and poverty and to bring that reality back to USC.
The other is to see where the civil rights movement came from, to see the roads where leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. marched and were beaten and jailed.
It’s been 50 years since King led a march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, but the city still remains poor and segregated. When students first step foot in the slow-moving city, Conerly says they all ask out the same shocked question — “Do people really live like this?”
“It’s a different type of poor than they’ve ever seen before,” Conerly said. “And I think it’s important for students to see how other people live, to see where other people are coming from and to see just how different it is from their own lives.”
While in Selma, the groups meet with a variety of USC alumni. The most prominent is a couple who moved from Los Angeles to Selma to reopen its movie theater. Once a major hub of life in Selma, it’s now labeled as “historic,” a relic of the past.
When the Selma movie theater first reopened, older locals broke down in tears as they stepped through the front doors. For many older members of the Selma black community, this was the first time at the movies when they weren’t forced to take the back door and climb steps up to the balcony.
The theater closed years later, unable to make a profit in a poor community where going to the movies on the weekend is a foreign concept.
Students also visit other important landmarks in Selma, such as the home of Richie Jean Sherrod Jackson, where Martin Luther King Jr. and other leaders stayed whenever they passed through.
At Jackson’s home, they see the table where King sat while planning many of his greatest marches. After hearing about these landmarks for so long, students are finally able to see some of the most important pieces of black history.
“You go through this house, and [Jackson] will point at a chair and say, ‘Martin sat there,’ or point at a bucket and say, ‘That’s where Martin would soak his feet after a long day of marching,’” Conerly said. “It makes it real. It’s shocking, how real it makes it all.”
One year, during their tour, a student noticed Rep. John Lewis, a former Freedom Rider and an integral leader in the civil rights movement, taking his own tour of the Jackson home. After a moment of hesitation, the group approached Lewis and spoke with him.
It is these types of moments that Conerly says make each trip unique and special for the students on it. Although she and Scott have carefully planned out each day of this year’s trip, they know that unexpected surprises are bound to come up — whether this means meeting a former Freedom Rider or simply speaking with someone who can remember listening to Dr. King speak in person.
“It’s the type of trip that is going to change these students’ lives,” Scott said. “It makes that big of an impact, and we are incredibly excited to be able to provide that experience.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the trip was organized by the Black Student Assembly. It is the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Since its opening in the fall, contemporary art museum The Broad has quickly become one of the most popular hotspots for artists and tourists in Los Angeles, attracting visitors from all over the world. Not only is The Broad home to spectacular visual artwork, it also hosts the music series, Callings Out of Context, inspired by Arthur Russell’s song, “Calling out of Context.” On Feb. 27, the newest program in the series spotlighted experimental music composers and performers Tyondai Braxton and Daniel Wohl.
Co-hosted by REDCAT, Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater, the series brings contemporary and transgressive musicians of different styles together to showcase new perspectives of diverse music genres and to break away from the rigors of classical composition. It also serves as an audio complement to the collection of pop art currently on display in the museum. The event was guest curated by composer and performer Ted Hearne, who is also an assistant professor of composition at the Thornton School of Music.
Braxton, former lead singer and guitarist of experimental rock band Battles, performed a solo show that fit perfectly for his musical style, incorporating familiar traces of classical music as well as components of electronic music for a unique auditory experience. In addition to his rock contributions, Braxton is also known for his successful album, Central Market, which features a full-length orchestral score. Musicians from Mantra Percussion and string players, arranged by violinist Lina Bahn, accompanied the performance. The sounds by the string players went well with the marimba and symbols but sounded off and out of place with the electronically produced synths and beats that played simultaneously. Though it is a commendable feat to combine genres from two different realms for an eclectic performance, at moments it felt as if an EDM artist and chamber music group accidentally booked their concerts on the same night and decided to just share the stage together last minute.
Krystal Ene, a sophomore majoring in communication, shared her thoughts on the first few songs.
“It was definitely an interesting and electrifying performance,” Ene said. “It was cool, and I’ve never seen or heard anything like it, but it’s not something that I would want to listen to for hours straight.”
During the second half, electronic-acoustic musician Wohl performed his entire sophomore album Holographic, which was recently released Jan. 16. In addition to eight musicians playing, with video imagery by acclaimed artist Daniel Schwarz, Wohl masterfully weaved layers of sound together to create a gloomily charming and enigmatic arrangement. The visuals were stunning, supplementing the sound perfectly and adding dimension to the show. After the performance, audience members gathered at the REDCAT lobby for drinks and discussion.
Those who visit The Broad or REDCAT for its extensive collections of aesthetically appealing visual art will be impressed by the museum’s ability to execute complex and engaging auditory art as well. Whether it’s hip-hop, electronic or indie-rock, Callings Out of Context programs strive to provide its audiences the experience to open their mind and ears to music produced in ways that have not been performed in mainstream media. While it can be a positive avant-garde experience for some, its unconventionality may not be for everybody. The series is set to hold more upcoming events throughout the spring and summer with dates yet to be decided.

The 1975’s sophomore album, I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It, emobdies unapologetically the band’s persona and their breach of today’s pop for authentic artistry. The 1975’s first full-length album, self-titled The 1975, peaked at No. 1 on UK album charts, and after touring internationally and building a dedicated fan base, this album is poised for greater attention. Amoeba Hollywood held a listening party prior to the release, where eager fans lined up to receive free merchandise such as free t-shirts and cassettes. The Manchester-based quartet have been linked since their teenage years, and ILIWYS surfaces new stylings in a post-fame chapter in their career.
A group that appears a typical indie rock band has its greatest influences derive from a few sources: ’80s rock, à la David Bowie, whose inspiration is sprinkled throughout, synth-pop and slower ballads derived from Peter Gabriel and Hall & Oates and modern funk, with inklings of Michael Jackson. Frontman Matthew Healy, whose spirited persona and performances electrify the band and its audiences offers some of his greatest songwriting contributions over 17 tracks. Healy is known for unorthodox, brutally honest and self-deprecating lyrics, but what seems off-color to some is intensely refreshing and bursting with talent, especially for a band  in the pop music spotlight.
The album’s opening song, an instrumental, is followed by “Love Me,” a tongue-in-cheek critique of the superficial, social media-obsessed culture. Punk guitars play on a riff throughout, and one can hear a modern version of David Bowie’s “Fame.”
The next song, titled “UGH!” features a groove that is almost as addictive Healy’s recount of his own tales of addiction. Healy’s robust vocals on the chorus are among the best on the album, but are followed up by a mellower tune in “A Change of Heart.” While minimalist instrumentally, the verses reference lyrics in some of their earlier records and impeccably paint a picture of falling out of love or feeling deceived. Healy, an intellectual humanist with a penchant for beat poetry, references Jack Kerouac, whose works may have inspired his lyrics to be those of a sort of 21st-century beatnik songwriter. “She’s American” almost humorously tells the tale of his differences with an American girl who “says I’ve got to fix my teeth.” “She’s American” is fundamentally pop-rock, but also as the fifth and final song on the A-Side of the vinyl record, it marks that the band has cleverly woven four different genres in influences into a seamlessly flowing star to the album.
“If I Believe You” is a stripped-down, analog undertoned, rhythm and blues piece that flows weightlessly. Healy’s filtered vocals hit deep as he confesses pain and insecurity, and despite being atheist, asks if he believed in God, if his troubles would go away. It’s one of the band’s best complete pieces in all aspects of the record. The next pair of tracks, “Please Be Naked” and “Lostmyhead” are an aesthetic instrumental whirlwind, which tastefully bring the album into a new phase. “The Ballad of Me and My Brain” enters as Healy’s vocals powerfully banter without rhyme how he’s lost himself in the band’s new state and image and the effect stardom has had on his mental being.
“Somebody Else” is Healy’s profession of platonic but pained feelings in finding out a lover has left him. Although simpler in composition, the electronic-infused rhythm, Healy’s murmuring, howling vocals and catchy-but-not-corny factor makes this a hit and has received radio play. “Loving Someone” takes the listener uptempo before the title track, which is mostly six minutes of instrumental music that varies extensively but speaks to the essence of the band’s tendency for intricate transitions which supplement the flow of the album. “The Sound” is the top track on the album. It’s an exuberant electric piano and bass beat that brings pop back into it’s heyday with edgy lyrics, catch chorus and excellent guitar solo from Adam Hann that listener’s can’t avoid dancing to.
“This Must Be My Dream” is a great soundscape that’s experimental followed by a saxophone solo. “Paris” is not only a melancholy picture of the people Healy’s come across on tour, but also an introspective look at himself. “Nana” is heart wrenching for anyone who has lost a loved one, as an ambient instrumental and acoustic guitar accompanies Healy’s restrained grief and message to his late grandmother.  “She Lays Down” is an all acoustic, demo-sounding take that satisfyingly caps off an excellent album.
Healy isn’t afraid to point fingers at society and hit intense notes, nor reflect and be somberly self conscious and relate to the listener’s life. Instrumentally, the album is sonically more 80s and electronic, but with so many influences, it’s clear the band has incorporated quality roots into their sound. The 1975 strike high marks across the board with ILIWYS, and it should go down as a pivotal record for the band and for pop music.

On Friday, Japanese film studio Studio Ghibli released Only Yesterday, theoretically their latest film in a long line of celebrated, classic animated films, such as Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke and Howl’s Moving Castle. However, Only Yesterday, in fact, was made in 1991 and only released in the States this year.
Only Yesterday tells the story of a young woman who travels to the countryside to visit family and, during her travels, reminisces about her childhood spent in Tokyo. The film is startlingly real — it depicts the turmoil of a 20-something bound by societal influences (her mother wants her married, her father won’t let her pursue a career as an actress). It is rife with those anxieties we have all experienced during childhood: first love, body exploration, identity confusion and so on. It is shockingly adult for an animated film, progressive in its portrayal of a Japanese woman growing up in modernity and attempting to find her place within its boundaries.
Studio Ghibli is one of Japan’s most influential studio houses. It has been around since 1985 and has consistently churned out 21 films over the last 30 years. If we liken it to film studios here in the U.S., it was providing films for audiences just as Disney was building American childhoods through their films. However, the main difference with Ghibli is in its depiction of strong women. Put it this way: as Studio Ghibli was releasing Only Yesterday in the summer of 1991 in its home country, Disney was in the process of marketing and selling Beauty and the Beast — wherein our protagonist Belle’s livelihood and ultimate happiness is pretty much solely based on the temperaments of a moody (and literal) beast. In 1989, when America was watching The Little Mermaid, Japan had Kiki’s Delivery Service. In one country, children watched Ariel lose her voice, only able to regain it once she’d received the “kiss of true love” (keep in mind, Eric falls in love with a woman who can’t even speak).  In Japan, children watched as a young witch used her flying powers to earn her own living. Miyazaki himself stated the film was about “the gulf that exists between independence and reliance in the hopes and spirit of contemporary Japanese girls.” In terms of influence — which film was probably better at teaching young girls how to operate in the world? With Disney’s Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella and Snow White — all classic films in the western canon of animated features — we’re taught at a very young age, that yes, in fact, one day our prince will come, but until then, it’s pretty darn depressing.
That isn’t to say that Studio Ghibli is superior to Disney. Disney is still responsible for some of my favorite movies of all time, and I am under no illusion that my happiness relies solely on the love and adoration of a guy who happens to find my glass slipper, but until then I shall sit in abject misery, waiting for his arrival. I’m only pointing out that there exists a large discrepancy between the films that American children were fed for the last 80 plus years and those that were released abroad. Studio Ghibli’s films have a certain propensity towards depicting the female protagonist and only the female protagonist. In Spirited Away, Sen grows from sullen child to capable adult. In Howl’s Moving Castle, Sophie changes from an insecure, shy young girl into an outspoken and strong  woman. When Disney does release films about women, it’s mostly about how they need a man to rescue them from the great depths of despair.
There is the argument that Disney is a little outdated when it comes to progressive children’s films. We now have Pixar studios to fill that void — and possibly match Studio Ghibli in terms of influence and inventiveness. And yet, Pixar still can’t beat Ghibli’s knack for nuance and sophistication. Pixar’s 2012 Scottish myth Brave  promised greatness in its depiction of a fiery red-head princess named Merida, but simply turned out to be an odd animated drama about a girl who’s mom is unfairly turned into a bear.
Of course, we now have Disney’s Frozen under our collective belts that marked a change in the annals of animated film history. And let us not forget 1998’s Mulan. But even with Mulan, the ending of our lead’s story is wrapped up in whether or not she’s loved by a man. In most Ghibli films, that type of girl-and-boy-live-happily-ever-after narrative is virtually non-existentent. I can’t even get into in this column how this may affect a young person when they grow up and learn that the happily ever after might not be so happy after all. But suffice to say, maybe our studio houses should turn toward Ghibli as inspiration for the types of films we should be giving the young, impressionable brains of today.

The USC Thornton Symphony performed a series of concertos by Krzysztof Penderecki, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Nikolai Kapustin, Friday evening in Bovard Auditorium. The performance was conducted by artistic leader and principal conductor Carl St. Clair.
The evening began with Penderecki’s Cello Concerto No. 2, featuring cellist Jonathan Dormand. Modern in musical styling, Penderecki’s score is defined by its fragmented and dissonant passages. The unraveling, cerebral concerto at times seemed to represent a Hitchcockian vision more so than a formulated classical piece. The orchestra was able to easily take Penderecki’s vision and stylistic cues and bring them to full realization.
Dormand was able to provide dramatic punctuation on top of the eclectic orchestral score. Knowing exactly when to embrace Penderecki’s style allowed the cellist to dig deeper into the meaning of the piece. St. Clair, however, seemed to take a back seat for the evening’s performances allowing soloists to bring the pieces to full realization.
In a dramatic shift of styling, soloist Sergio Coelho was able to lead the orchestra in Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto in A major. Emphasizing technical ability and Mozart’s precision, the orchestra took us on a musical journey with the jubilant sensibilities of Coelho leading the way.
Coelho’s performance was superb, to say the least, showcasing the heights of clarinet proficiency and taking the clarinet to its limits. If Mozart’s music can be described as fitting together like a puzzle, then the interplay between Coelho and the symphony showed no seams.
The last piece of the evening, Kapustin’s Piano Concerto No. 2, could have easily been at home in a jazz club or the Broadway stage. Much like the work of George Gershwin, Kapustin was able to successfully intertwine both the jazz and classical worlds in his work. Soloist Andrea Choi on piano guided the orchestra and audience in a lush and lyrical score. Showcasing both technical and artistic proficiency, Choi was able to make the piano shine, sparing no tricks. A brassy, lively orchestra proved that they know not only how to effectively perform the classics, but also how to perfect lighter music.
Choi played the piano the way it was meant to be played: digging into every corner of the piano’s abilities, knowing exactly when the piece demanded technical and serious phrases and when musical fireworks were needed. Choi’s ardor and pure enjoyment showed not only true showmanship, but serious range in a musician.
The Thornton Symphony’s next performance will be on March 11th at 7:30 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium. The performance will feature music by Russian composers; Sergei Rachmaninoff’s Symphonic Dances and The Firebird: Suite by Igor Stravinsky.

A universal fact about college is that when midterm season rolls around, the stress levels among students rise exponentially. This midterm season, I have noticed, has been particularly stressful for students as the projects, papers and exams pile up. I fell victim to this last week as I tried to master time management to keep stress levels as low as possible.
One test I wasn’t expecting to be stressful? My yoga midterm. I took yoga this semester as a way to bring some balance to my school and work life. Yet, while prepping for the exam this past week I found myself using flashcards to remember the Sanskrit vocabulary and watching YouTube videos to review key poses. I actually set aside time to study for this one-unit P.E. class.
I’m not the only one. Other Trojans have shared stories about how they ended up auditing their yoga class because instead of finding serenity, they found another class to stress about.
At USC, like most U.S. universities, P.E. classes are not required. A 2013 study showed that only 39 percent of colleges require their students to take a P.E. class. A century ago, that number sat almost at 100 percent.
Some colleges are trying to buck that trend and keep physical fitness at the forefront of their students’ minds. A college in Oklahoma recently made it mandatory for its freshmen to wear Fitbits to track their daily physical exercise. Students at Oral Roberts University must take a physical education course — in which they must walk 10,000 steps a semester in order to receive their diploma.
Larger universities have maintained this pattern as well, including Ivy League schools Columbia University and Cornell University.
Yet, students at USC could greatly benefit from accessing a P.E. class every semester.
Kyle Peterson, a junior majoring in international relations global business, has taken full advantage of USC’s P.E. classes. In just two semesters, he has taken yoga, self-defense, weight lifting and physical conditioning. Though he initially signed up to complete elective units, Peterson has found purpose in the classes beyond just their academic offerings.
“I do [physical conditioning] right in the middle of the day,” Peterson said. “It really helps to keep me sane and sweat every once in awhile. It’s a way — outside of a midterm or paper — to see improvement.”
Sometimes students shy away from the classes that focus on physical exercise because of the stress to be perfect in them. That’s what I thought. On my first day in yoga, I was wondering why I wasn’t as flexible as everyone else in my class. When you’re getting a letter grade, like in other academic classes you know you have to perform at a high level to succeed. But that is not the case in P.E. classes at USC. Many instructors stress that it’s about personal improvement.
Everyday in class my yoga instructor says: “Don’t look at others on their mat. Focus on what you can do on yours.”
So when taking a P.E. class, you’re not just burning calories but starting the process of pushing yourself for a greater payoff down the line. In addition, P.E. classes speak directly to the conversation about mental health on campus.
“This goes into mental health and well-being,” Peterson said. “It helps me relieve stress. I think it’s important to have those goals for yourself and something that is outside of the classroom, even if it’s just two hours of the week.”
Despite me feeling a bit pressed about my yoga midterm last week, I would have to agree with him.
The University is constantly reshaping its academic offerings. They have placed a broad range of physical education classes for us to sign up for. The University doesn’t have to make them mandatory because they give us so many options of how to access those classes, whether that is through auditing them or taking them pass/fail.
The first step is signing up, then setting our alarm clocks to wake up and taking part in those physical education classes. Your mind, body and soul will thank you for it later.

Over ten thousand protesters swarmed New York City in late February advocating for the release of Peter Liang, a former NYC cop who faces up to fifteen years in prison for the manslaughter of an unarmed man in a Brooklyn apartment stairwell. In late 2014, Liang and his partner Shaun Landau were conducting a vertical patrol in a public housing development in Brooklyn, when Akai Gurley entered the stairwell after leaving his apartment. Startled by the sound, Liang fired his weapon and fatally wounded Gurley with a single shot.
Liang’s conviction was a first for an American police officer in over a decade. Unsurprisingly, countless protesters carried “no scapegoat” signs, alleging that the officer was a sacrifice to forward an image of police accountability while maintaining the record of impunity white officers have had for similar crimes. Organizations such as the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence, a NYC non-profit focusing on community initiatives and advocacy for lower-income Asian Pacific Islanders, have been targeted as “race traitors” for their support of the conviction.
The vitriol surrounding Liang’s conviction is not an opportunity for validating Asian-Pacific police officers, and it warrants no response other than one of healing and empathy with the Gurley family. The past weekend of protests has made a misplaced argument of victimization at the expense of black lives.
This victimization is the clearest in a New York Post op-ed comparing Liang to Vincent Chin, a Chinese man beaten to death by two American auto workers accusing him of stealing American jobs. Chin’s death was conducted in cold blood by two racists who cared little about Asian Pacific lives. Liang, on the other hand, was himself a perpetrator of police violence. His multiple conduct violations, ranging from having a finger on the trigger in a non-threatening scenario to his failure to provide Gurley basic medical aid, cost a human life. A Medium article by Annie Tan, niece of Vincent Chin, places Liang’s guilt succinctly by comparing Chin to Gurley rather than to Liang.
It isn’t enough to picture ways in which Asian Americans have been mistreated throughout American history; we must consider how we ourselves impose prejudice in our own communities. Gurley was shot in a vertical patrol, an infamous tactic in New York in which police officers patrol multiple floors of low-income housing projects occupied by primarily black and Latino residents. Few Asian Americans encounter police brutality and widespread economic inequities, which black and Latino people face. Few Asian Americans have lost the same level of homeownership due to racism in urban mortgage markets. Liang may be a scapegoat for police accountability, but he surely is not a victim. Advocating for Liang’s acquittal loses sight of larger issues of systemic injustice in American police forces. The same excuses are used time and again to excuse white police officers from the murders of black youth. Gurley is just a name among many — like Eric Garner, Michael Brown and Sean Bell — that represent the thousands of black Americans who never see justice at the hands of the police.
It’s too late for Asian Americans to be excused from violence and discrimination in America. A viral video by Fusion media network shows footage of a Chinese American woman at the Brooklyn rally petitioning for Asian Americans to be left out of the “cycle of systemic injustice.” This argument is centuries too late; the history of Asian Americans in the United States is inseparable from discussions about violence against all people of color. Popular conceptions of Asian Americans as successful and hard-working have inversely portrayed black people as problem populations. The internalized prejudices in Asian American households have manifested themselves in instances from affirmative action opponents decrying black students to the silence in response to a counter-protest demanding respect for Gurley’s family. In a protest that has seen historic levels of turnout for Asian Americans, people must turn toward responses to the actual systemic causes and not just ask to be excluded from the historical context of Gurley’s death.
For me, a 1.5 generation Asian American, this is as important for my identity as it is difficult. There are few real answers on how to respond to Liang’s conviction, but responses must start with a baseline of respect and empathy for those hit the hardest. The past weekend was a sign not of social progress, but rather a need to recenter discussions of social justice by questioning how Asian Americans are implicated.
how can you compare Vincent ,Eric Garner, Michael Brown and Sean Bell with Gurley in the same race issue.  Officer Liang did not know who he shot,  so let’s be honest with ourselves  and take race out of the equation.  All other victims were clearly victims of racism. But if you want to talk about the bigger picture for the good of BLM,  then Peter Liang and Gurley are victims of NYPD training, policy and  DA misread the political consequence of his decision.
WAKE UP BLACK PEOPLE WE GOT NO ALLIES WE NEVER HAD ONE. WE ARE ALL WE’VE GOT!!!
Just because you are black does not mean that you are allowed to a thug.
Half a century of “affirmative action” has totally eroded American society. Meritocracy is practically dead in America. As long as you can protest and riot, you will get a ticket to college and politics. 
And it is very shameful for the author to betray his/her own ethnicity. If you are an American, you love, cherish and defend America no matter whether she is right or wrong. The same thing goes in terms of ethnicity. Few black people will side with Darren Wilson or Peter Liang. They are united, that’s why they are so powerful.
Power is a zero-sum game. Which side are you on?
ASIANS ARE OUR ENEMIES FUCK ALL OF YOU!

We all love Spotify. It has endless playlists already pre-made for whatever mood or genre we are feeling at the moment. But it’s impractical to sort through the millions of existing playlists to find the best ones. To make things easier, here are some great playlists you’ll find for all different moods and genres. 
1. Twerk It
Despite the slightly aggressive name, this playlist is quite the addition to any party. With a mixture of old dance favorites like Snoop Dogg’s “Drop it Like it’s Hot”  and newer songs like Tinashe’s “All Hands on Deck” remix, this playlist is sure to pump up any party. 
2. Life Sucks
Let’s be honest. We’ve all had those days where nothing seems to be working out. Breakups, fights, bad grades and just plain old bad moods can really put a damper on your day. Why not have the perfect low-key playlist to help you work out all your feelings and wallow for a bit? Trust me, this playlist will actually help you feel a little bit better.

I know this might sound crazy, but this is one of the most interesting playlists I have ever come across. It’s full of dark, moody, folky songs that will definitely treat your ears to a new experience. This is a great playlist if you are simply tired of the same old pop sounds of radio. 
4. TGIF
Speaking of pop-radio hits, this playlist is a great compilation of all the current hits. Featuring Justin Bieber, Zayn Malik and even a menagerie of popular electronic songs from artists like the Chainsmokers and Diplo, TGIF is a great playlist for some current hits and a pump up for the weekend.

Music is one of the most important parts of my workout each day because it can help pump me up and increase my calorie burn. This is a great playlist for gym-rats  and newbies alike. It features great alternative-pop hits from bands like Walk the Moon, Imagine Dragons, MGMT and more. 
7. Hawaiian Dreams
I’m not usually a huge fan of sleep playlists but for those who are, this is a fantastic selection of songs. Why not fall asleep to calming sounds of the islands? Soft ukulele music along with island-inspired vibes make this playlist an actual a dream to drift off to. 
8. Country Nights 
For all those country fans, this is the perfect playlist to get ready for the upcoming Stagecoach Festival. Featuring popular country artists like Florida Georgia Line, Blake Shelton and Luke Bryan this is a classic collection of songs for all the country fans.

10. All Out ’90s
We all love those serious throwback hits from our childhoods. This is the playlist for you if you’re in a nostalgic mood for the golden days of artists like Britney Spears and Smash Mouth.

The men’s volleyball team lost in four sets (25-16, 25-20, 25-27, 25-16) to arch-rival No.4 UCLA Saturday night at the Galen Center.
The Trojans (3-13, 3-11 MPSF), who have dropped both matches to the Bruins (15-3, 11-3 MPSF) this season, got off to a slow start, failing to take the lead until midway through an exciting third set that saw 12 ties and four lead changes. Defensively, USC struggled, recording only three blocks, all of which came in the third and fourth sets. 
UCLA took advantage early with a balanced attack. The team started the match hitting over .700 and continued to distribute kills evenly between sophomore outside hitter JT Hatch — who led the team with 13 — and five other players who scored at least 7.
“We were in that [competitive] mindset,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “Everyone gets up for USC-UCLA. [The question is] who can keep that mindset up and be in the moment to recognize, to analyze, and to execute? Did we do that consistently? Obviously not.”
UCLA hit over .400 in games they won — the first, second and fourth — and .386 for the match. USC had no answer for the Bruins’ middle blockers. Sophomore Oliver Martin and junior Mitch Stahl combined for 14 kills, zero errors and a .737 hitting percentage. 
“UCLA was able to do what they wanted to consistently,” Nygaard said. “They stepped up their game and challenged right from the gate. It was hard to play catch-up.”
Meanwhile USC’s offense sputtered from the get-go. The Trojans hit just .154 in the first set and .148 in the second. Through two sets, only junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder and senior outside hitter Alex Slaught had positive hitting percentages. 
Yoder’s performance was one bright spot for the Trojans. He recorded 17 kills and hit .516. That said, Yoder was not impressed by his individual performance. 
“We lost,” he said, “I don’t care [about my numbers].” 
The Trojans finally looked energized in the third set. Down 16-11, USC sparked a 7-2 run to tie the match at 18. Yoder notched 4 kills in that span continuing his best performance of the season. Another 5-2 run brought the Trojans to double-set point, but they failed to convert both and then fell behind 25-24. After scathing off match point, the Men of Troy came back to take the set 27-25 with an emphatic block by senior opposite Josh Kirchner. 
“In the first two games, we served terribly,” Yoder said. “In the third game, we gave ourselves a chance by serving aggressively and keeping our serves in play. That gives us the best opportunity to win.”
However, USC’s momentum did not carry over into set four as the Bruins jumped out to a 12-5 lead. The two teams traded points the rest of the way until UCLA closed it out 25-16. 
“The loss was disheartening,” Yoder said. “We weren’t giving ourselves chances at the service line. We made a lot of errors. It’s tough losing like this. I don’t think anyone’s used to it or anyone likes it, but that’s what gives us that desire, that burn to work harder and improve.”
Up next, the Trojans have a home-and-home with Cal Baptist that starts with a road match Thursday.

The Knight Program in Media and Religion, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the Global Post hosted a daylong conference on Friday, “Understanding Syria’s Refugee Crisis,” which brought together panels of scholars, journalists and activists to analyze the Syrian civil war and the resulting humanitarian crisis culminating in a keynote speech by BBC News’ Paul Danahar, the former Middle East Bureau Chief.
Four panels led up to the keynote speech of Danahar, who won two Emmys and a Peabody for his coverage of the Arab Spring during his time as BBC’s Middle East Bureau Chief. He now serves as BBC’s North American Bureau Chief.
During his speech, Danahar stressed the idea that the Syrian people are no different than people who live in countries that are not marred by a lengthy civil war.
“The people sitting around me at the dinner table in Damascus on a warm Summer’s evening in 2012 had two things in common,” he said in his opening line. “They were the intellectual heart of Syrian society and they all used the same waiter for every single event they ever held. They could be served good food and fine Lebanese wine by someone outside of their class who wouldn’t then sell them out to the police in the morning.”
That was how the early stages of the civil war affected wealthy Syrians. When the battle came too close to them, they left in hopes of finding an education for their children, who were the first generation to be worse off than their parents. 
“The conversation at dinner revolved around one question…what would be the trigger for them to leave their relatively comfortable life,” Danahar said. “Over the coming months they all individually found the answer to that question and have now all left Syria.”
The working and middle class people, Danahar said, stayed and tried to appeal to the international community for help. But when that did not work, they picked up their weapons. In Syria, Danahar met Omar Shakir, part of the Baba Amr brigade, one of the Syrians who initially thought help would come. 
“He said to me, ‘We thought that when we started the livestream and the rockets began falling down there would be a no fly zone or that they would come immediately and stop this,” Danahar said. “He got the world’s attention, but as we know, the world just watched.” 
Danahar also explained that the Islamic State was able to use the fighting between the al-Nusra Front and the Syrian government to expand their caliphate. 
“Because the [al-Nusra] Front fought against Assad, it allowed the ISIS group to claim the project of building their so-called caliphate,” Danahar said. “ISIS had [al-Nusra] and the moderates fight the government and Al-Baghdadi [ISIS leader] focused on capturing territory and fighting only those that got in his way.”
After explaining the motives for the numerous stakeholders in the civil war, Danahar moved on to talk about the international community reacting to the sudden influx of refugees. No one except Turkey was willing to take the refugees because, according to Danahar, there was sudden fear amongst the international community following the Paris and San Bernardino attacks.
“In American and in Europe…before the fall of last year America was, as it always has been, a welcoming nation toward refugees,” he said. “And then Paris and San Bernardino happened and people went from sympathy to fear.” 
Danahar said that the recent ceasefire agreement is an indicator that the war has begun to wind down. The Syrian people will not go back under Assad’s dictatorship though.
“You have to understand the way the Assad regime is set up, they would control your safety, your security and your food and your right to healthcare and your right to education,” he said. “Why would anyone go back to a regime that was barrel bombing them a couple of months ago and is going to be in control of every aspect of their life.”
When the war finally ends, it will have been the Syrian people that have lost, said Danahar. Their society has been ripped apart and it will take many years to repair it. On that note he ended with a quote from a woman he met in Damascus.
“‘I kept thinking we’ve hit the bottom and then we went deeper,’ she told me,” he said. “And now I’m worried where the bottom will be.”
Students in attendance knew the importance of understanding the Syrian civil war, including sophomore economics major Allison Mobley. Mobley enjoyed Danahar’s overview, even more so because she watches the BBC.
“I thought he did a wonderful job…he really have a good overview,” she said. “I really enjoyed his presentation and I also watch the BBC so that’s cool.”
The audience had a chance chance to ask Danahar about the crisis. Many were curious as to what will be done following the war and whether it would be better to keep Assad in power or depose him. Danahar had a similar answer to most of the audience’s inquiries:
“I haven’t got any answers. All I know is what I’ve seen and understand from history that I’ve studied and the people that I’ve talked to,” he said. “I don’t know where you go from here.”
The day started with a 9 a.m. panel on the Sykes-Picot Agreement — an agreement which defined the borders of Iraq and Syria following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Laurie Brand, professor of international relations and Middle East studies at USC, James Gelvin, Near East history professor at UCLA and Charles Sennott, co-founder of the Global Post, an international and U.S. news website discussed the implications of the agreement for the conflict in Syria.
Starting in 2010, anti-government protests spread across the Middle East — coined the “Arab Spring” by the Western media — and ultimately led to a crackdown on Syrians by President Bashar al-Assad’s government. Nader Hashemi, the director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Denver, Dina Jadallah, lecturer in Arabic language and society at USC, and Kevin McKiernan, Pulitzer-Prize-nominated journalist and filmmaker of conflict areas, examined how the Arab Spring led to the current refugee crisis in Syria.
The latter half of the conference focused on the global response to the influx of Syrian refugees and the possibility of their resettlement.
Dr. Shelly Culbertson, policy analyst for the Rand Corp., Raife Gülru Gezer, Turkish Consul General for Los Angeles, and Martin Zogg, executive director of the International Rescue Committee and Refugee Forum in Los Angeles, which helps displaced people find a home in Southern California, gave their input into what the future of Syrian refugee resettlement will look like.
The last panel dissected the response by outside nations to the plight of Syrian refugees. Hussam Ayloush, executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations and chair of the Syrian-American Committee, Stefan Biedermann, German deputy consul in Los Angeles, and Susan Fratzke, policy analyst for the Migration Policy Institute in Washington D.C. touched on the fear that many countries have of welcoming outside refugees
The Center for Religion and Civic Culture, the Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics, the Center for Public Diplomacy, and the USC Center for Islamic Thought, Culture and Practice co-sponsored the event.

These Arabians were determined to be Terrorists by their bloodlines.
The millions of so-called Syrian refugees, most of which are from other West Asian and North African countries, that are overwhelming the European Union’s welfare systems have been brought to White Countries by Jews like Frau Chancellor Angela Merkel to commit Genocide against White People because they are jealous of us. 
Merkel is not Jewish, but you are a neo-Nazi.
Angela Merkel is a Jew-by-Blood who is descended from Marrano Jews in the Iberian Peninsula who were members of Synagogues and has no right to bring Arabians to our White Homelands that outsiders call the European Union. She’s the new Adolph Hitler, also a Jew, whose real last name was Schicklegruber, I in the other hand am the Chief of all 5-Million WHITE Humans on Earth with no Rhesus monkey Genes. My blood type is AB-Negative.
You’re an embarrassment to the human race.
It’s safe to assume you’re a proud KKK’er as well as a neo-Nazi?
Let me get this straight, you’re a Jew named David Horovitz using the avatar Arafat to pretend you’re an Arab because your pathetic job as a troller is shout down anyone your employer the FBi says is a threat to national security.
