The Undergraduate Student Government Senate discussed a formal complaint filed against Sen. Jacob Ellenhorn by Program Board Executive Director Diana Jimenez at Tuesday’s Senate meeting. The complaint, which called for Ellenhorn’s removal and was filed Monday, alleged that Ellenhorn undermined the work done by the Program Board, misused his title as senator and did not uphold his duties by breaching several USG bylaws.
Jimenez claimed that Ellenhorn promoted a hostile environment by inviting conservative political writer Milo Yiannopoulos to an event hosted by the College Republicans, a group for which Ellenhorn acts as president. Another alleged violation was Ellenhorn’s failure to follow procedures while filming a Program Board event.
Ellenhorn released his own statement online and to several media outlets Monday, refuting the claims. Ellenhorn defended his actions and argued that Jimenez’ complaints were an attack on his conservative political beliefs.
“Taking issue with these speakers shows Jimenez’s [sic] lack of interest in diversity of thought, and her propensity for silencing the opposition,” Ellenhorn said in the statement. “Jimenez is clearly jealous of the fact that the events I put on as President of the College Republicans received far more attention than any of hers.”
During the discussion portion of the Senate meeting, Jimenez brought up her complaint against Ellenhorn. She noted that she and the senator had not yet spoken privately on the matter, but she had received a copy of his statement from fellow Sen. Alec White.
“I haven’t got a chance to talk directly to you, Jacob, and if you want to address any of the concerns,” Jimenez said. “I was forwarded your statement from Alec, but I haven’t got to sit down with you and hear your concerns.”
Ellenhorn told the Senate that he will refuse to meet with USG members privately at this point, based on advice from private legal counsel. Ellenhorn disagreed with the premise of Jimenez’ allegations in the complaint.
“They’re all ridiculous, they’re unfounded, and you rooted them in the fact that you disagree with my political philosophy and with all of the activities that I do outside of USG,” Ellenhorn said. “I find your witch hunt against me to be politically motivated and completely unfounded, and I look forward to our hearing on [March 23], in which the Senate will not impeach me and in which your complaint will be thrown out where it belongs.”
Jimenez responded that all of her allegations were based on bylaws that USG members are expected to follow. In her formal complaint, Jimenez outlines the specific regulations that she believes Ellenhorn violated.
“Most of my points were based on the fact that you actually haven’t completed your role as a senator,” Jimenez said. “I want to make sure that we are fulfilling our duties as people who are held accountable to this University.”
Sen. Giuseppe Robalino disagreed with an allegation made in Jimenez’ complaint, which stated that Ellenhorn failed to refer students who had concerns appropriately. Robalino said that the bylaws were in fact not violated as the complaint alleged and that Ellenhorn had fulfilled his duty as a Senator.
“By taking the step to having met with the individuals or just having brought it up, and saying, ‘I will be the Senator to follow up,’ he referred [the students],” Robalino said, “So how do you stand on the basis that he violated that bylaw?”
Jimenez argued that Ellenhorn did not sufficiently follow through on his commitment to address those students’ concerns.
“It’s not explicit in this bylaw, but it’s explicit in your role as a senator,” Jimenez said.
After the end of the 15-minute discussion period, the meeting was adjourned. The issue will be discussed further and put to a vote by the Senate on March 23.
In a just world, Miss Jimenez will one day be working for Mr Ellenhorn.  Given that he is a conservative, and she a liberal, that is a far more probable outcome than the reverse.
The most amusing part is that Miss Jimenez’ complaint simply brings more attention to Mr Ellenhorn’s views and the College Republicans organization; was this what she intended to achieve?
“Liberals claim to want to give a hearing to other views, but then are
shocked and offended to discover that there are other views.” — Wm F Buckley, Jr
Diana Jimenez is a totalitarian, who wants to prohibit dissent on campus.
I am a proud Trojan Alumni (’83 BSME & ’91 MSSM) … USC taught me to listen to others, to learn from others, to stand up for my principles, and to use my own personal experiences, along with my great education to make myself and the communities I touched a better place to live in. I am saddened to see that there are portions of the current Trojan Campus (both student and faculty; the Student Senate and Stephen Smith, an adjunct professor  and executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation) who are shunning their duties to have personal respect for students’ views that oppose theirs.
I expect that Ms. Jimenez will gain from this experience and will be more acceptable of her fellow Senators views after the backlash from this grows. Mr. Stephen Smith is old enough to know better … the USC I attended cared about my thoughts and my visions and has made me the person I am today … perhaps his position as “adjunct” should be reevaluated.
USC has by far the most demographic student population in the most demographic and diverse city in all of the US … perhaps its citizenship and associated members should take light of this fact and think about the negative repercussions that follow when some of its Student Senate & faculty don’t exude acceptance and would rather spout discrimination and cry that USC is a hostile environment.
Dear President Max Nikias … please get this out of the public spotlight … this type of news is not comforting to an established Trojan alumni base and looks bad on the respect that USC has garnered over the years.
Based on this and other more detailed reports, it appears Miss Jimenez has completely failed to understand what it means to be a Trojan.  Fear nothing, welcome adversity and use your learned tools to build a better society, alas it appears she has only studied victiimology.  I was unaware it became an official course offering.  
Grow up Miss Jimenez, you’re in the process of joining the big boys and girls.  It’s time to start acting like one.
Wow.  It looks like USC has been hit by a blizzard with all the snowflakes raising a stink about this Conservative Senator.  Here’s a reality check members of the Konfused Kids Klub.  Speech is protected, including hate speech.  It’s always amusing to see Liberal minded students studying a private colleges offended by the fact that the 1st Amendment is even allowed to exist.
YGBSM!!!!! This is so typical of liberals who cannot stomach anyone who disagrees with them. Drop your complaint Jimenez and  grow up. YOU and your ilk are the bigots now!
Jimenez may not agree with Ellenhorn’s statements or the occasionally brash way in which he responds to criticism, but that isn’t enough to constitute Ellenhorn’s impeachment and/or removal from office. USG should not be a place of singular thought but instead an arena for intense discussion and contrasting of opinions.
If we let such bigotry and close mindedness invade our campus, we will have nothing to set us apart from the hell that is the UC system, where there is one school of thought that everyone must abide by, and anyone who doesn’t agree is strong-armed and bullied out. Shame on Jimenez.
This is pathetic.   Jimenez should be dismissed for this hypocritical action.    And people wonder why the likes of Trump are rising in popularity – enough is enough you special snowflake weak students trying to remove our 1st amendment rights.    Grow up.
The sound I like to hear is someone getting a lot of wood on the ball.  Excellent comment.
What a sad day to think that we live in the world described by Orwell!  Jimenez should be ashamed of such transparent policing of thought and the crime is so much more at a supposed institution of advanced learning that precious resources and capital are being expended in a hearing. 
I am embarrassed to read this at my alma matar, absolutely embarrassed.

Tony Fox, associate director of USC’s Marching Band, the Spirit of Troy, directed his last basketball game on Saturday. Fox has been arranging music for the band with Spirit of Troy Director Arthur Bartner since 1971.
Fox obtained his master’s degree in composition and began to teach at USC in 1981. He was the assistant director of the band and began to teach part-time at the school of music.
“My degree is in composition, and I have always been a composer-arranger,” Fox said. “I have done a lot of different arranging for orchestra band choir and jazz band, I have even arranged for a Chinese orchestra once. I am basically a professional arranger, who teaches band as well.”
Fox talked about the fond memories he shared with members of the band. He explained how each band section would split up into buses for away games and would pull various pranks.
“One year, they had t-shirts that said, ‘If you get in trouble, say you are Tony Fox,’” Fox said laughing.
Although Fox will miss his time at USC, he knows that he is ready for retirement.
“I have this philosophy that all great things come to an end,” said Fox, attributing his mindset to his Tibetan Buddhist belief system. “This was a great run; it is time for me to move on in life.”
Bartner and the USC band members said they will miss having Fox on campus.
Bartner recounted his times working with Fox to retune arrangements. He and Fox would work together after surveying their students to see what songs to play for each game and then would work to layer the different instrumental sounds. Bartner said that Fox has done an exceptional job working with USC, especially in developing the world-renowned song “Tusk” with Fleetwood Mac, featuring the USC Marching Band.
“Tony is the sound of the Trojan Marching Band,” Bartner said. “Together we have built the sound of the band.”
Fox recounted many of his memories he had while teaching at USC. His favorite arrangement was when the band performed “Frankenstein” by AC/DC for the first time.
“‘Frankenstein’ set the template for what the band sound was going to be. It was so unique,” Fox said. “That arrangement, we premiered in the season of ’73, at Notre Dame. That was one of the first rock songs that actually was performed in Rockne Stadium. It got a big standing ovation, and it has been a favorite of the band ever since.”
Antonio Ayala, a freshman bass drum player, will miss Fox’s passion for his work.
“Tony was a very skilled composer that knew how to expand both our musical capabilities and excitement about playing,” Ayala said. “I’m going to miss both his talents and his passion.”
But Fox said that the band’s greatness is because of the students and the work that they put into the band.
“The kids in the band have been very important to me,” Fox said. “My arrangements are their arrangements. I want to give them a good product.”
He notes that this hard work, Bartner’s vision for the band, the Trojan Family and the USC Fight Song are what made the band great and incredibly diverse over the years.
“You put all this stuff together, and you go. This is a great place,” Fox said.

Three USC students have a shot at winning $1 million in Dubai this Friday and Saturday by reaching the regional finals of the largest student competition in the world.
Each year, former President Bill Clinton’s Clinton Global Initiative, a subsidiary of the Clinton Foundation which brings leaders together to create solutions to global issues, partners with the Hult International Business School and asks students to form teams of three or four members. Teams must create a project that will address the Hult Prize Challenge. The Hult Prize is an organization that promotes social entrepreneurship by encouraging students to solve many of the world’s major challenges.
This year, 25,000 teams applied and 303 of those teams were asked to attend the regional finals. A team of three USC students is among those selected to advance.
Out of the teams that will compete in the regional finals, one will be selected to receive a one-year membership into the Clinton Global Initiative and will be given the opportunity to spend the summer at the Hult Prize Accelerator, which is an incubator for social enterprise, according to its website. In addition, the winning team will not only receive $1 million, but also attend the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting, where the members will pitch their ideas to a world-class audience.
The team includes Adam Gramling, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering with a focus on information systems; Will Harris, a senior majoring in business administration; and Sam Calvert, a sophomore majoring in accounting.
This year’s challenge encourages participants to find a way to double the incomes of those who live in poor conditions by improving mobility and connectivity. The income double must be achieved by 2022, according to the competition’s website.
The team is creating a dynamic education system that connects people with the online freelancing market. This will allow someone working in Jakarta to make a U.S. salary, giving the worker access to a much larger economy.
Gramling competed in the program last year and made it to the semifinals in Shanghai. He wanted to compete again this year, so when he told Harris and Calvert about the challenge, they decided to form a team. Now, the three members of the team have become best friends.
“We call each other at 2 a.m. saying, ‘Guys, I have this new idea. What do you think?’” Gramling said.
The team said each of the members brings a different skill to the table; Harris is strategic, Calvert handles finances and Gramling works with implementing the ideas.
Gramling said the team has been meeting for about 10 hours each week since September. After one month of hard work, Harris told the other members of the team they should come up with a new idea. The team members decided to take the freelancing trend and the market for individuals and pair them together to come up with their current solution. Last year’s challenge had to do with education, so Gramling was able to use his experience to help the team come up with a new project.
“You get connections with these wonderful people, so when you take an idea to them, they have the power to actually go execute it,” Gramling said.
The competition allows each team to choose the location its members will travel to if they make it to the regional finals. Gramling said his team chose Dubai because the solution they came up with revolves around freelancing. Given Dubai’s proximity to India, it is a good market for the judges to understand the team’s pitch.
Though the team is hoping to win the competition, Gramling said he believes just going through the process of participating in the program is beneficial.
“I feel it’s a very worthwhile learning experience just getting involved with this,” Gramling said. “One of my life goals is I really want to make a big change in the world and affect a lot of people, and I feel this is a great outlet to do so.”

When The Village Runner St. Patrick’s Day 5K run/walk commences on Sunday, USC alumna Rebecca Soni, an Olympic gold medalist, will don her sneakers to benefit the American Cancer Society.
Soni is the honorary race starter for The Village Runner St. Patrick’s Day 5K run/walk. A South Bay local, Soni will not only be hosting the event, but she will also be participating in the race this Sunday.
“I live here in Redondo, so although I’ve never participated in this event before, I’ve seen and heard about it,” Soni said. “This is my first time, but I’m so excited to be a part of it. As the host, I’ll be there pretty early on in the day to start the race and send everybody off.”
The 13th annual St. Patrick’s Day 5K is a community event to honor Chase Stecyk, a boy who passed away from cancer at only 11 years old in 2011. However, this year is the first time the St. Patrick’s Day 5K will be partnering with the American Cancer Society to raise money for the charity’s cancer research and free patient programs.
Don Franken, a race organizer who has been a part of the St. Patrick’s Day 5K for the last six years, explained that the American Cancer Society is a great addition to the race this year.
“All of us have been touched by cancer in some way,” Franken said. “It’s all over my family. It’s all over many families. All proceeds will go toward the American Cancer Society, and I couldn’t think of a better charity to support.”
Race participants are also encouraged to wear green to represent Stecyk’s favorite color and holiday — St. Patrick’s Day. Franken explained that the event hosts a costume contest at the beginning of the day and that the event is a bonding event for the whole South Bay.
“You can really see the whole community come together,” Franken said. “People arrive in all kinds of crazy, outrageous costumes, wearing shamrocks on their cheeks and dressing up as leprechauns, pots of gold or entirely in green.”
This year, the St. Patrick’s Day 5K is expected to attract approximately 1,500 people. Participants range from 1-year-olds to 80-year-olds who still love running.
Danielle Boyer, the event coordinator for the race, has been working for Village Runner since the summer before her freshman year of college. She loves seeing all the kids race from year to year and watching them progress as they get older.
One runner succeeded in high school running and is now at the United States Merchant Marine Academy.
“There’s just something to be said about watching kids and teens become passionate about the sport of running, and it’s especially touching to help be a part their lives,” Boyer said.
Besides running at the St. Patrick’s Day 5K, participants can enjoy other perks of the event, including food, entertainment and a Race Expo. Franken, who is also responsible for marketing and communication, has put together a number of corporate partnerships and sponsorships.
“Every year, we have a health and fitness expo, where different companies participate,” Franken said. “There are chiropractors, physical therapists, local realtors and other community business leaders who come to showcase their healthy lifestyle products and services.”
Since her Olympic days, Soni has continued to lead an active and nutritious lifestyle by hiking, boxing, doing yoga and eating healthy. As a mentor and role model for young athletes, she hopes to empower everyone to embrace health and fitness.
“What I’m most looking forward to at the St. Patrick’s Day 5K is the community aspect,” Soni said. “I’m excited to see everyone together, having fun and celebrating the joy of being healthy and active.”

Researchers, writers and media professionals held a discussion on misconceptions about Muslims and the role of the media, as well as political groups, in perpetuating these stereotypes Tuesday evening in the Annenberg Auditorium.
The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy and Institute for Diversity and Empowerment at Annenberg hosted the panel, titled “Is the War on Terror a War on Muslims?”
The panel consisted of Associate Professor of Clinical Education Shafiqa Ahmadi, Executive Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Southern California Hussam Ayloush and former CIA analyst and case officer John Kiriakou and was moderated by Annenberg Clinical Professor of Communication Robert Scheer. Juan Cole, a professor of history at the University of Michigan, and Wajahat Ali, playwright of The Domestic Crusaders, were present via Skype.
The event began by discussing the issue of discrimination against Muslims, which has become more prominent in recent years. Ahmadi especially mentioned how she came across discrimination against Muslim women in Hawaii.
“They have a policy that they can’t cover their head when they went into banks,” Ahmadi said. “It was a pretext to not allow Muslim women to enter banks. It’s a paradise as a place, but discrimination happens all the time.”
She also spoke about how Muslims were profiled at airports and discussed her fears for the future.
“I look at Muslim students who are profiled, [and] my fear is about the new generation,” Ahmadi said. “My fear is more for the young individuals who are considered guilty by just being part of the Muslim community.”
Cole spoke about how Muslims were being framed as the prime topic of terrorism, while in reality, Muslims in America carried out only 3 percent of terrorist attacks.
“Terrorism is rationalized to Muslims,” Cole said. “The Muslims were under more surveillance, whereas the vast majority of attacks come from other groups, but no one talks about them.”
According to Cole, right-wing terrorism is not a part of the discussion in the United States. He also talked about how the U.S. government has committed atrocities against Muslims, which are rarely mentioned in the same context as modern-day terrorist attacks.
“No one bothered to read the book on Iraq before attacking it and trying to govern it,” Cole said. “They tried to run Iraq in English. They killed so many people for not understanding English.”
He mentioned that America has traditionally formed alliances with Muslim-majority countries, which serve both a diplomatic and military purpose.
“We have more formal allies in the Muslim world than any place else,” Cole said. “So how is it that the Muslim world is an enemy? That is bizarre.”
Ali spoke about the role of media in creating a negative image of Muslims. The information that Americans receive from media is overly negative, Ali said, and as a result, it reinforces their ignorance and shape their image of Muslims.
“Muslim labor, Muslim sweat, Muslims stories have cultivated the soil of America,” Ali said. “Even though Muslims have been in this country since 16th century, poll after poll says that 60 percent of Americans don’t know Muslims. All they know about Islam or Muslims is through media.”
Kiriakou brought up personal examples of the young Muslims he has talked to in his travels throughout the Middle East. He said that they weren’t radical, just poor and uneducated, and popular perception of Muslims does not differentiate between the two. However, he also argued that media is not solely responsible for spreading a negative image.
“It starts in the White House and goes down through media,” Kiriakou said. “Most Americans are very easily influenced; they get caught up in the feeling that they have to rally against people who are different than we are.”
The solution, according to Ayloush, is that students should educate themselves about these issues and attempt to separate media portrayals of Muslims from reality.
“The constant negative depiction of Muslims is a vicious cycle, and we should really care about perception because perception is reality,” Ayloush said.
Why, oh why would anyone ever think Muslim values – values which include jihad, the caliphate, disdain for infidels (all non-Muslims) – are any different than western or Hindu/Buddhist values?
+++
Fortunately millions of non-Muslims are being forced by world events to wake up to how truly dangerous Islam is. We ex-Muslims know that Mohammedanism must go the way of the dinosaur or the planet will drown in the blood of sharia as Muslims enforce the laws of Islam.

If you want to understand the enemy “Read what they say”. They constantly justify their acts with accurate and apt citations from the Koran and Hadith.

 Teach theocratic insanity, reap holy madness.
The Koran is an ideological tumor that infects and destroys the hearts and the minds of those who embrace this retrograde dogmatic lunacy.
It spreads into the world through the AIDS-like cultural immune system destruction of political correctness and moral equivalency and the denial of the survival instincts rampant in the “progressive” West.
It will vaporizer cities before the infidels shall finally awaken.
Millions dead needlessly.
Thanks to leaders afraid to be thought of as “bigots”.
Their deadly delusion is the Fifth Column.

Yes…it’s entirely predictable. Another in the endless litany of atrocites is perpetrated by Islamist terrorists and the response is ”we must not allow this to fuel anti-muslim sentiment”.

I don’t hate the Koran, the Koran hates me. The Koran is hate speech toward unbelievers and should be outlawed.

•	If you need to stand up for the real underdogs in this battle of ideas – stand up for the ex-muslims (muslims who have left islam) and freethinkers/intellectuals of the muslim world and in the western societies. They are the ones who are persecuted/killed and defamed and slandered by traditional muslims (even your so called moderate muslim friends) – almost reflexively like a mafia system.
•	
Factually, look up the punishment in the legal systems of muslim majority countries and opinion polls about blasphemy and apostasy amongst muslims living in the western world. These are facts on the ground. Historically, these human rights violations have been worse in the history of islam.
This fact makes islam unique – unlike any other. islam is also a political doctrine not just a religion – since it finds it’s way again in the constitutions of the 40-50 countries in the world. Do you even get the enormity of this? In tens of countries , leaving and criticizing islam is punishable by death.
Can you grasp it? This is the 21st century.

If an ideology is peaceful, then its most literalist or fundamentalist adherents too would be peaceful. In the case of Islam, let alone Al Qaeda or ISIS, what the governments of Iran or Saudi Arabia do is plain for all to see. In Saudi Arabia they publicly behead people for even drug trafficking, and in Iran they hang them to death for being homosexual.

It is no wonder that Muslims are so focused on Islamophobia. Lacking convincing arguments, charm and positive contributions to their surroundings, being feared is their only chance to gain at least some kind of “respect”, and to scare the less brave into not warning the world about Islam’s obvious genocidal nature and its prophet’s thirst for blood and underage girls.

Again can be seen that willful ignorance of evil is worse than evil itself.  These panelists are living proof of this.
Yeah, why would anyone ever be so silly as to profile Muslims?

The following was written a year ago…
+++
A beheading in Woolwich, a suicide bomb in Beijing, a blown-up marathon in Boston, a shooting in the head of a young Pakistani girl seeking education, a destroyed shopping mall in Nairobi – and so it continues, in the name of Islam, from south London to Timbuktu. It is time to take stock, especially on the left, since these things are part of the world’s daily round.
Leave aside the parrot-cry of “Islamophobia” for a moment. I will return to it. Leave aside, too, the pretences that it is all beyond comprehension. “Progressives” might ask instead: what do Kabul, Karachi, Kashmir, Kunming and a Kansas airport have in common? Is it that they all begin with “K”? Yes. But all of them have been sites of recent Islamist or, in the case of Kansas, of wannabe-Islamist, attacks; at Wichita Airport planned by a Muslim convert ready to blow himself up, and others, “in support of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula”. “We cannot stop lone wolves,” a British counterterrorism expert told us after Woolwich. Are they “lone”? Of course not.
A gas facility in southern Algeria, a hospital in Yemen, an Egyptian police convoy in the Sinai – it’s complex all right – a New Year’s party in the southern Philippines, a railway station in the Caucasus, a bus terminal in Nigeria’s capital, and on and on, have all been hit by jihadis, with hostages taken, suicide belts detonated, cars and trucks exploded, and bodies blown to bits. And Flight MH370? Perhaps. In other places – in Red Square and Times Square, in Jakarta and New Delhi, in Amman and who-knows-where in Britain – attacks have been thwarted. But in 2013 some 18 countries got it in the neck (so to speak) from Islam’s holy warriors….
The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy and Institute for Diversity and Empowerment at Annenberg hosted the panel, titled “Is the War on Terror a War on Muslims?”
Only an intellectual could think of something this stupid.

They say beating the same team three times in a season is almost impossible. USC will have to squash that claim if they hope to keep their dream season alive.
After an up and down Pac-12 season, the Trojans (20-11, 9-9) will enter the Pac-12 Tournament as the No. 7 seed and face their crosstown rivals, the Bruins, for the third time this season.
In their first two meetings, USC ran away with the wins. The Men of Troy won by an average of 16.5 points and held the Bruins (15-16, 6-12) to their lowest scoring total of the season, 61 points, in their last meeting at the Galen Center.
Although the Trojans were dominant in their two victories, head coach Andy Enfield doesn’t want his team to overlook the Bruins.
“We’re playing a very good team, a very talented and explosive team in UCLA,” Enfield said. “They’re as talented offensively as any team we have played this year. They can put points on the board in a hurry, and they have good players at every position that can score. It is going to be very challenging for us.”
The Trojans utilized their speed and athleticism in their two matchups against the Bruins. UCLA has one of the best front courts in the Pac-12 led by the duo of forwards senior Tony Parker and sophomore Thomas Welsh. However, the Trojans opted to play small in both games in order to get out and run.
Parker and Welsh had their way in the first game, combining for 43 points and 19 rebounds, but the rest of the Bruins shot 27 percent from the field and scored just 32 points. USC went on to win 89-75.
In their second matchup, UCLA head coach Steve Alford opted to play small and bring Parker off the bench. The Trojans feasted on the small lineup and ran the Bruins out of the gym. Parker played just 14 minutes and the Trojans went on to win 80-61.
Coming into the season nobody expected the Trojans to be this good. Much of their success has come from the play of their backcourt. Junior guard Julian Jacobs and sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin have had stellar seasons and both were named to the All Pac-12 team, first and honorable mention respectively. The duo has combined averages of 23.5 points, 10.3 assists and 8.5 rebounds.
As a team the Trojans have stepped up their play tremendously this season. Six Trojans are averaging double-digit points. The Men of Troy currently have the third-highest scoring offense in the Pac-12, with an average of 80.7 points per game. Their scoring defense has been stellar as well, with the Trojans holding opponents to just 41 percent shooting.
The Trojan’s biggest caveat this season has been their inability to win on the road. The Trojans finished 16-2 at home but went 4-9 away from the Galen Center. In fact, their only wins away from the greater Los Angeles area were over bottom seeded Washington State and a neutral site victory over Wichita State.
“This year the Pac-12 was really good at home. I think the road winning percentage was around 20 to 30 percent, which is really low,” junior forward Nikola Jovanovic said. “We are a really young team relatively. I think that we learn from every game [on the road], and this is the perfect time for us to play well on a neutral court.”
Luckily for the Trojans, the only team that may be worse away from home than them is UCLA. The Bruins also won just four games on the road this season.
Tip-off is scheduled for Wednesday at 6 p.m. The game will be aired on the Pac-12 Networks. The winner gets the opportunity to play Utah on Thursday.
“UCLA did not have trouble beating us three times last year,” Jacobs said. “So we are going to try to return the favor.”

I am giddy with excitement — a ruthless, vengeful, maniacal excitement. I haven’t felt this much evil excitement since I was probably 13, in the stretch of puberty and teenage angst.
I’ve been blessed to grow up with some great years of USC sports. But I’ve never seen what could potentially happen today. It’s never happened in my generation.
USC could complete a full sweep of UCLA in football and men’s basketball. And end UCLA’s basketball season. The city title would so clearly, indisputably, hang in Heritage Hall for a full year. The Victory Bell would ring loud and clear all the way until November.
I’d like to think of myself as a nice, happy person. And I’m not that competitive either. I’d rather play a game of FIFA with a partner against the computer than go head-to-head.
But I hated UCLA in middle school. OK, “hate” is a strong word, but I really, really, really didn’t like UCLA. I think I genuinely enjoyed beating UCLA as much as I enjoyed watching USC win at that age. I proudly displayed as my Facebook profile picture in 2009 — back before Facebook even had cover photos — the glorious, triumphant picture of two UCLA employees trying to scrub off a coat of red and gold paint from a campus Bruin Bear statue.
Middle school is always a crucial phase in the coming age of a sports fan. For me, it meant a new school with new friends, and I needed an identity to latch onto. I had been raised during the height of the Pete Carroll era in football, but I had plenty of growing up still to do with USC sports, allegiances to form, pointless arguments to wage over the superiority of a couple football national champions to 100 non-revenue sport national championships, realizations to have that I wouldn’t be able to root for any other college football team five or so years before checking boxes on the Common App. The rivalry — and personally identifying as a Trojan — was a huge part of the social dynamic between me and all my friends.
I had been indoctrinated by USC football very early. But to achieve true Trojan fandom, I had to jump in on basketball. For USC basketball, it was the perfect time to become a fan.
Though maybe it does not quite warrant the distinction of being referred to as an era, the height of Tim Floyd’s tenure as the men’s basketball coach, between 2007 and 2009, was the pinnacle for the program. USC made the tournament three years in a row, had a couple wins in the tournament and, overall, was just fun to watch.
But most importantly, we competed with UCLA.
Of course, UCLA basketball was one of the premier national programs at this time. With future NBA stars like Russell Westbrook and Kevin Love gracing the floor of Pauley Pavilion for the blue and gold at the time, they were a consistent national title threat and put together a string of Final Four appearances — though as I loved to remind my Bruin friends, none of those Final Fours actually added up to a ring.
So anytime we could pull off an upset against UCLA, it was a big deal.
Of course, we established our dominance on the gridiron. In my entire early fandom, the only time USC lost to UCLA was in 2006. It was just a given that we would beat them every year.
And it was great. I loved that stepping on them was a rite of passage at the end of the season.
But it wasn’t quite as special as every time the basketball team would steal one away in the rivalry. Winning in football was kind of like getting money from the tooth fairy. Obviously great, but only really memorable those times you got a $5 bill instead of the usual single — or in this case, when we beat UCLA 50-0. Winning in basketball was like growing up without an Xbox but still being able to take your friend down in Madden.
At the root of the rivalry, beneath all the animosity, there was a genuine admiration for the Bruins. In the spirit of Anchorman, I might have hated the Bruins, but I sure did respect them. Almost as vividly as I remember the Trojans’ upset win over UCLA in the 2009 Pac-10 Tournament, I remember UCLA’s epic comeback win over Adam Morrison and Gonzaga in the 2006 NCAA Tournament.
So it’s with a weird, almost verging on empathetic feeling that I go into tomorrow’s game. I never imagined there’d be a day when USC basketball could beat UCLA three times in one season and guarantee them a spot in the NIT instead of the real one. The rivalry is always better when both programs are at their strongest, so I gave up rooting against them every game a while ago.
But the 13-year-old in me will absolutely be back in full force tonight. I’ll be very bummed if the chance for the sweep passes ‘SC by because it might not present itself for a while.
And with me on track to graduate next year, it’ll almost definitely be last time it’ll potentially be socially acceptable to get a serious Facebook trash talk debate going.

Football spring practice opened Tuesday afternoon, and the team’s focus is on improving everyday. Everyone had some first day kinks, but players said that it felt good to be back on the field.
“It feels great,” senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers said. “I’m playing faster. This is probably the smoothest I’ve been since I’ve been here.”
Junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster agreed but also mentioned the quick turnaround from hard workouts to full practice.
“My legs are kind of tight and sore,” Smith-Schuster said. “Yesterday was our first day squatting, so then to come out here full speed running … but it feels good.”
Coaching Turnaround
With first-year head coach Clay Helton at the helm, a slue of new coaches has been added to the staff including his brother, quarterbacks coach Tyson Helton.
“It was a great first day,” Tyson Helton said. “A lot of excitement, a lot of focus which is the way it should be. There’s a lot of talent out here, and I’m looking forward to working with them every day.”
The coaches have been well-received by many players who are saying that they are totally on board with the new staff as well as their new implementations.
“This coaching staff is amazing — they make me want to work hard and be perfect,” Rogers said.
Offensive players said there was going to be a lot more action for the receivers on offense this year to create a more balanced offensive scheme.
“We have new signals and plays, so we have to adjust to that,” sophomore tailback Ronald Jones II said. “The team likes the new plays and new systems. There are a lot more receiver sets because we don’t really have a fullback yet. It looks like we’re going to be a lot more balanced this year, which is good.”
Quarterback Frenzy
Four quarterbacks saw significant reps for the Trojans on day one including redshirt junior Max Browne, redshirt freshman Sam Darnold, redshirt sophomore Jalen Greene and true freshman Matt Fink. Tyson Helton said he was impressed with his quarterbacks for where they were at the beginning of the season.
“Quarterbacks were about where you’d think for a first day; there’s a lot of things we need to correct but pretty good overall,” Helton said. “There were a couple jitters early, but once they got in the groove, I think they realized ‘Hey, this is just like anything I’ve always done.’”
Browne and Darnold are expected to be the frontrunners in the quarterback competition, but Greene received a significant amount of reps during practice as well. Helton said he was specifically impressed with the play of Browne, Darnold and Greene.
“They understand the plays and the mechanics of the plays, we just have to get better and better on the technique side of things,” Helton said. “The young freshman Matt Fink, it’s his first day out here, so limited reps, but we wanted him to have some success, so we put him in certain situations, and he took advantage of them.”
Dealing with the different quarterbacks is a challenge for receivers according to Smith-Schuster, but he had nothing but praise for them after practice.
“Max Browne has a cannon that we have to get used to,” Smith-Schuster said. “Sam Darnold has that accuracy, and Jalen Greene, who has that speed, but also throws with his left hand. Trying to catch from different quarterbacks is kind of hard, so I’m glad we’re doing it at the beginning of spring.”

Last Wednesday’s 81-70 victory over the Oregon State Beavers marked the first time since USC’s 2008-2009 campaign in which the Trojans have amassed 20 victories or more.
The last time USC accomplished such a feat, the Men of Troy finished the season with a 22-13 record, making it to the NCAA Round of 32.
The 20-win campaign this season nearly matches the amount of victories current head coach Andy Enfield achieved during his first two seasons at USC.
According to Enfield, this season belongs to his players and their ability to develop as a team and overcome hardship.
“It’s special,” Enfield said. “We know we have some basketball left to play, but we want to recognize our players because they’re the reason. They’ve helped turn this program around, and they’re the reason we have those 20 wins. They’ve done an outstanding job this year of fighting through the adversities, fighting through the downtimes and the injuries and coming together and winning 20 games. For them to do that, I’m very proud of them.”
This 20-win season would not have been possible without the improved play and maturity of guards sophomore Jordan McLaughlin, junior Julian Jacobs and redshirt junior Katin Reinhardt.
Not only have the experienced guards’ on-court capabilities turned into success, but their off-the-court behavior has also had a major impact this season.
Jacobs, the team’s primary ball distributor with 5.4 assists per game, is a dual-threat on the court, sporting both offensive and defensive prowess. This year, Jacobs is third on the team in scoring and rebounding and second on the team to Jordan McLaughlin with 35 steals.
Earlier this week, Jacobs commented on his renewed confidence physically and mentally in his 2015-2016 campaign compared to his first two seasons.
“Freshman and sophomore year, I was very fragile mentally,” Jacobs said. “When something would go wrong or I wouldn’t be playing well, I would be completely out of the game … I played at one speed in the past, and now I’ve learned how to slow it down, attack when I need to, make the right pass. It just comes with being older.”
Jacobs’ renewed maturity and confidence have allowed him to dissect the Trojans’ struggles this season as he cited a lack of maturity on and off the court as a potential setback for the squad, especially on the road.
“I think sometimes we can be immature,” Jacobs said. “It’s just little things. It’s hard to explain. Whether we’re late to a meal when you’re supposed to be on time, that stuff kind of translates onto the court. It’s taxing being on the road for five days in a hotel room.”
And while Jacobs holds a vocal role on this 20-win Trojan battalion, often leading with his words of encouragement, his opposite guard and team captain Jordan McLaughlin leads by example.
McLaughlin, the team’s leading scorer with 12.9 points per game  to go along with 3.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists and a 42.4 percent shooting percentage from 3-point range, emphasized his commitment to his teammates earlier this week and the importance of leading by example.
“I’m not that much of a vocal leader, so I’ve been trying to work on that. I’m the one that leads by example. In drills, I’m the first one to go and going 110 percent,” McLaughlin said. “USC basketball — it’s not just one person. It’s not saying Jordan McLaughlin won the game; it’s saying USC won the game. At the end of the day, it’s whether USC won or lost … it’s the whole team.”
Overall, the Trojans have experienced many adversities in the forms of McLaughlin’s injured nose, Jacobs’ injured ankle and even redshirt junior forward Darion Clark’s separated shoulder. The importance, the Trojans say, is that they are able to bounce back and be the team they need to be.
And although the offense and leadership run through McLaughlin and Jacobs, Reinhardt understands the potential of this year’s team.
“They don’t know who we are … they’re not with us every single day, so we don’t even care what they say to be honest with you,” Reinhardt said in response to those who doubt the team’s potential. “[We’re] guys that just want to win, play hard when we win and just make it far. We’ve had a chip on our shoulder all year, and we’ll play with that for the rest of the year.”
As it stands, the Men of Troy are projected to make the NCAA tournament. Jacobs mentioned that while the season has taken a toll, the Trojans still have as much of an opportunity as anybody to make a statement this March.
“The games that we’ve won were not flukes,” Jacobs said. “It was because we outplayed those teams, and we’re capable of beating any team that we play against as long as we play defense. When we [play defense], there’s not that many teams out there that are better than us.”
With the Pac-12 tournament beginning Wednesday, the Trojans will have an opportunity to make history by capturing their first conference title since 2009.

Descanso Gardens will host their annual Cherry Blossom Festival this weekend in L.A., a celebration of spring, beautiful cherry blossoms and Japanese culture.
A good indication that spring is in the air is the arrival of beautiful cherry blossoms. These petite pink flowers have a weekend celebration dedicated to them in Los Angeles. The Cherry Blossom Festival will take place  on March 12, and 13 from 9 a.m until 6 p.m. This is an annual springtime celebration that the garden puts on. The festival includes various activities suitable for all ages that focuses on the Japanese culture accompanied with the flowering of cherry blossoms. A discovery station, origami and cherry blossom walks are a few of the activities that will be available for enjoyment.
But, what’s a celebration without food? Japanese cuisine will be available to purchase throughout the day — the menu includes different Japanese entrees and desserts, including green tea ice cream. The Camellia Lounge, named after the flower, will feature exquisite Japanese cuisines like portobello teriyaki, a seasonal sushi roll and vegetable tempura. Not to mention, there will be a performance on the koto, a traditional Japanese stringed instrument by performer June Kuramoto on both days, starting at 1 p.m, and Japanese flute music will be played throughout the garden. If you are a Descanso Garden member, admission is free to this event; however, if you aren’t a member you can still attend. Adults pay a small fee of $9, students and seniors can get in for $6, and children’s admission is $4.

USC’s Heartwood just released their latest single, “Can’t You,” debuting their new, more polished rock sound but with catchy, sing-a-long melodies. Heartwood is comprised of four USC students, Michael Armstrong (lead singer/guitarist/trombonist), James Prinzi (drummer), Pat Rector (guitar) and Ameet Eini (bass). Playing a single release party this past weekend, the band gave fans a taste of their new work, with more songs to be released in late April.
Armstrong and Prinzi sat down for an interview with the Daily Trojan to talk more about their new music and where the band is headed.
DT: How did the band Heartwood come together?
MA: We were in the pop program together, and it was like the first month of being here as freshmen. I was like, “I wanna start a band!” James and I are technically the first members. It was me, James and a couple other guys, and we had a rehearsal with these other guys and they were kind of like, this isn’t our thing. It took a couple months sifting through people and then it became me, Pat, James and [former member] Chris Jackson. Then about six months ago Ameet joined, and that’s the current line-up, it’s the four of us. Once Ameet joined is when it started going and become a real thing.
DT: Where did the name Heartwood come from?
MA: James and I were trying to figure out a name for the band, and we opened a dictionary and it was literally the first thing we pointed to. The biggest thing was that we were really drawn to the name because of its definition because Heartwood is actually part of a tree and it is the inner part of the trunk, which is supposed to be the densest part. We thought that that was really describing the songs we were writing, which spoke to core human emotions. That’s why we really found an affinity for the name at first, and now it’s just become this thing with the images and the branding.
DT: How would you describe your sound right now? What has changed from the old stuff to this new single?
MA: It’s kind of a new direction for us; we kind of wanted to start fresh. The other stuff was a good beginning effort because we did it all ourselves. It was a little bit more sporadic in terms of our sound. We didn’t really have a good idea as to what we wanted to be. I would say the [new] songs are just better at their core. We’re years older now from the stuff that we started, so we’ve matured a lot and made decisions in the past, and we knew which routes to take as far as the sound we want to go with. Once Ameet joined too, he was very good about getting on us, like, ‘OK guys, let’s talk about what we want to do and what we want to be.’ That’s when we really started talking about what we want our sound to be and our brand to be. That’s when it all came together, when we had these conversations, and it was like, I want to take this kind of Nirvana sound and combine it with these kinds of drum sounds, and it all became this thing that was like, “Wow, We can all really get behind this and support this.” No matter what we’re proud of it, whereas, the other stuff was kind of like, we’re figuring it out, we’re throwing it together. So that’s kind of why the shift happened.
DT: Describe your sound or what the band is in a sentence.
MA: I’ve been calling it 2016 rock and roll. We’re trying to take what rock and roll used to be, the aggressive guitars and all that kind of stuff, and make it into a place that is 2016 basically. People can turn that on and be like, “Woah this is badass, this is rock.” But not, “Oh this is something from the ’90s or the ’70s.”
DT: What’s the songwriting process like for Heartwood?
JP: Michael writes most of the songs on his own. He’ll write an acoustic guitar, chords, melody and lyric kind of thing. A lot of the creative decisions about what we want to do with the song, arrangement ideas, that’s very much collaborative effort. Michael will bring the skeleton, but the finished product is everyone. Sometimes it’ll take 30 minutes and sometimes it’ll take two months.
DT: Are you looking to play more shows this year?
MA: We have a couple shows lined up, San Diego in April and a few more. We’re trying to keep our shows a little spread out this semester just because Ameet’s gone, so we don’t want to do too much without him here, which is why we’re focusing on the releases since those are already done.
DT: Where do you see the band in the next few years? After college?
MA: We talked about that a lot, we’re very prepared to go after college with the band. I think for all of us this is the main priority musically, so we want to take this as far as we can go.

Breaking up sucks. It sucks so much that we’ve made this thing called hook-up culture that never really says goodbye. It’s easier to keep ends ambiguous, unspoken even to oneself because it’s a thousand times less uncomfortable than making the decision to look someone in the eye and say “I’m done.” Even if you have to reroute your walk to class for the rest of the semester, avoidance still seems optimal to confrontation. Simpler still is not dating anyone, or so I thought. In my mind, if there’s no romance there can be no break- ups. It seems pretty understandable, obvious even, but it’s not.
I’ve played water polo for roughly seven years now. I fell head over heels for it as my relationship with my former sport, swimming, began to fail. It took me forever to officially break up with swimming, and there were a few years when I was doing both — something neither of my coaches liked. Eventually, though, I transitioned out of swimming and into water polo, and I was smitten.
When I finally left swimming once and for all, it was a good riddance type situation. Water polo was everything swimming was not, and I wanted to rid my system of my past affiliation. Swimming was quiet, reserved and neurotic, whereas water polo was social, fast-paced and wild. People who played water polo embodied these things, and I wanted to be a water polo person — all the scrappiness, the goofiness, the confidence. And that worked for me for a while.
We had to take a couple breaks though, water polo and I. I couldn’t play while I was abroad, I couldn’t play when I got back because of how much I was working. This past semester was the first time I could practice in over a year, and I was serious about rekindling our connection. But something had changed. I no longer felt the itch to race my teammates, to work out outside of practice, to stay late, to come early. During our first tournament, I didn’t even feel the need to play — I was more than willing to sub out for one of my more eager teammates.
At the end of the tournament, our coach — one of my long time friends — told us she expected more. She said there was no excuse for missing practice, that we all needed to spend time in the gym, to swim outside of practice. I hung my head and listened, looking doleful but I knowing I wasn’t willing to commit any more than I was already.
The water polo situation was really no different from the “are we exclusive?” talk. The last time I had it, it came up mid hook-up, which will go down in my history as one of the most awkward romantic moments ever. He wanted more from me, he wanted a commitment, but I wasn’t willing to do it. I liked him a lot and I wasn’t seeing anyone else, but there’s a mental change in explicit monogamy that I wasn’t ready for — with him at least. I wanted him — and water polo — to be a fun distraction from my other responsibilities, not my main focus. But that’s not an option when you’ve been asked to commit and if my relationship-ing has taught me anything, it’s that nothing lasts long after you’ve established a limit to what you’re willing to give.
My partner took it well, much better than my last partner did. He didn’t throw a tantrum or anything, but he was visibly hurt. My coach, on the other hand said she understood completely, that she had just taken leave from her job for the same reason. Obviously, there’s a difference between ending a romance and an athletic involvement, but they’re both part of a larger category of commitment.
Moving into adulthood, I think it’s important to learn to really evaluate your obligations. Breaking up is an inevitable part of that, like pruning dead limbs off a plant. It doesn’t have to be a malicious gesture — most of the time, it’s not. I was very fond of the last guy, but I also fought more with him than anyone else I’ve dated. Water polo was great to me for a long time, but it doesn’t change the fact that I don’t feel the same satisfaction now as I used to. Better to say close but no cigar  than to suffer through something not quite right simply because you’ve made a commitment. Breaking up, making the conscious decision to move in a different direction, is growing up, for better or for worse.

Marissa Renteria | Daily Trojan
Two hundred and thirty-nine years after the American adoption of democratic rationality, it looks as though we have come full circle and embraced the cult of personality once more. The trend began with the election of Barack Obama, a junior senator with an untempered ability to channel collective passion and deliver groundbreaking oration to craft his life story into the quintessential narrative of the American Dream. However, as the dust of 2012 began to settle, the political landscape started looking much more judicious and organized. On the left, the Democratic National Committee prepared to coronate Queen Hillary Clinton. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney’s major loss indicated to the right that its base did not want another elite blue-blood, distanced from reality. Furthermore, with the revelation of the National Security Agency’s domestic spying and an increased consciousness in the racial bias of police brutality and the public education system, the GOP appeared to be primed for a strong surge of libertarianism.
Flash forward to 2016, and the Republican front-runner is a reality TV star and abuser of eminent domain Donald “[Avoiding STDs] was my personal Vietnam” Trump, and Clinton is being out-cooled and out-polled for the millennial vote by democratic socialist Bernie Sanders. Wait, what?
The country is choosing to overthrow the political party with a strongman, big-government, Wilsonian concept that Trump and Sanders alike exemplify. While this disruption has reaped many much-needed benefits, it is giving way to a Europeanization of American politics which will ultimately lead to economic instability.
First, it is important to appreciate the positive implications of this realignment. The DNC was practically rigging the election for Clinton. Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz restricted the number of Democratic debates to six during the primaries under the threat of an exclusivity clause because she suspected that Clinton would perform unfavorably in a medium which values authenticity and trustworthiness — two tenets of the Sanders campaign and appeal — and suspended Sanders’ campaign after one now-fired staffer gained access to a software error revealing Clinton’s voter information. On the other hand, America’s salvation from a third Bush dynasty presidency can be largely attributed to the advent of Trump and populist rhetoric. Furthermore, these primaries speak wonders about the decreased power of finance in elections. Jeb Bush practically burned through money, pulling the absolute elite of American political donors, yet somehow spent $2,800 per vote in Iowa and received less than 3 percent of the vote.
However, the disruption of the dynasty has led to a fervor of moral indignation, inhibiting a great deal of rationality and sparking emotionally charged but oft fallacious discourse. According to a January 2016 USA Today poll, millennial Republicans favor Trump at 26 percent, and young Democrats favor Sanders to Clinton at 46 to 35 percent. On top of that, Trump won seven states on Super Tuesday, as many as Clinton, and Sanders took Oklahoma, a state with a proportionally young population and surging youth political momentum.
While these candidates may seem like polar opposites, they share a reliance on yet-to-be-specified advisors, an unabashed desire to expand the government and a fundamental misunderstanding of economics. Trump has no allegiance to economic research or moral philosophy, instead espousing the same few buzzwords and phrases to pander to the electorate which crave nationalistic fervor and “winning.” Similar to Italy’s infamous Silvio Berlusconi, Trump’s businessman appeal is heightened more by bombastic, self-aggrandizing rhetoric than by actual record. Trump’s actual economic prowess is moderate at best. Trump’s current wealth, derived mostly from his real estate deals and many failed business ventures, is far lower than it would be if he had simply invested his multimillion dollar inheritance in a general stock market portfolio. Additionally, at the last CNN-Telemundo Republican debate Marco Rubio pinpointed the abysmal ambiguity of Trump’s economic policies — and really, the strongman charade as a whole — when he stated, “[Trump] says five things … everyone’s dumb, he’s gonna make America great again, we’re going to win, win, win, he’s winning in the polls and the lines around the state.”
On the other end of the ego spectrum lie millennial Sanders supporters, who ignore the absolute fallacy and fantasy of his economic policy. None of his ambiguity, misunderstanding of fairness of opportunity versus outcome or disdain for consumer choice is to say that he is not acting out of purely good intentions. After all, Sanders was arrested for civil rights activism decades before it would have been respected by the mainstream. However, the exact wave of emotional fervor that leads nationalistic millennials to embrace a reality television star is the same as that which is leading millennials to “feel the Bern,” even when the Bern simply is not backed up by math.
America cannot afford to turn to fascist and socialist extremism. We have a winner-take-all, two-party system which will exclude moderate, reason-backed economic policy if we effectively Europeanize our main political parties. Millennials need to stop thinking with their feelings and start listening to the facts to secure a hopeful future of general prosperity.
The fact is, and something this author has gotten totally wrong, that Trump is not in favor of expanding the federal government.
Good write up, hence Cruz is the only option at this o oint. Kasich a surprise us, in which case I’m in with K. Howver, he isn’t doing well at all, so once Kasich and Rubio withdraw and align their voters to Cruz, we win and Trump gets trumped.

On Sunday, a fellow Trojan was a victim of a hate crime at Cardinal Gardens Apartments, where he was accosted simply because of his race. Racist incidents call not only for tolerance, but also for the reconstruction of a new campus climate without prejudice and discrimination. Clearly, there is a need for a strong minority voice at USC — perhaps the inclusion of more minority faculty members, specifically in predominantly white areas of scholarship — could be a step in the right direction.
The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences has 452 tenured or tenure-track faculty — only 14 of whom are black, 15 of whom are Latino and two of whom are Native American. Evidently, the need for more minority professors is not an issue of representation or inclusion. Rather, it is a solution to a lack of academic and professional diversity, both of which disproportionately isolate minority students and disadvantage the collective student body. By actively maintaining a white faculty majority, the University inadvertently reinforces outdated and reductive racial tropes which exclude minorities from academic spaces.
In short, USC, like most other institutions of higher education, tokenizes the appointment of minority faculty, and by extension, tokenizes the admission of minority students. The sheer numbers alone suggest that both groups are included on campus as a formality, perhaps even to meet a hollow appearance of racial diversity.
Many — but not all — minority faculty teach courses that address diversity-related content at predominantly white institutions. By sectioning off minority professors to a specific discipline, such as Native-American history or sociology of racial and ethnic issues, the University creates a system that suggests that minority professors are only suited to cover issues that engage their minority experience.
While diversity-related study is certainly important, if the University truly cares to address racism and campus climate, it needs to provide comprehensive curricula that diversifies all areas of study, not just elective and general education courses. Ultimately, this better prepares students for work in complex and diverse communities and provides knowledge of history, science and art that supersedes the confines of Eurocentric teaching. The benefits of academic diversity begs the question: Why does USC have more minority faculty in the American studies and ethnicity major than it does in math?
In particular, minority faculty are an asset to subjects considered “non-diverse” because these professors provide nuanced and racially conscious perspectives, scholarship and research opportunities. Imagine taking a law class with a black and female tenure-track professor. The natural intersectionality of her academic experience could potentially expand her research and teaching to include diversity into the study of law. For example, rather than assess the criminal justice system’s treatment of plaintiffs in her research, she could use her racial background to diversify her work to specifically provide, as author Susan Mann suggests, “a cursory review of cases involving black female plaintiffs.” The discussion of race in general should not be limited to electives or GE courses alone; a different viewpoint simply allows for a more specific and in-depth analysis. Intersectionality is important because it provides resources for analysis and perspectives that address inherent discrimination and helps students understand how different identities impact access to opportunities and rights.
Representation and inclusion have a significant bearing on student engagement inside and outside of the classroom. Therefore, the presence of white-dominated faculty has serious repercussions for the quality of education, the social and cultural climate of campus life and the image of the University altogether. Minority faculty are an important mentoring resource for minority students, as they are inherently equipped to deal with issues of structural racism common in predominantly white institutions. Currently, there is not a strong enough pipeline for the recruitment and retention of minority faculty; in the same way, there are not enough mentors for minority students, and being a minority on a college campus comes with a host of social, economic and political disadvantages.
It is clear that USC needs to expand its recruitment and retention of minority faculty, and it needs to develop networking and mentoring tools for faculty. The lack of transparency on faculty demographics shows that perhaps USC has something to hide. Regardless, the stark numbers of minority faculty in Dornsife alone reveals its true colors as an institution not committed to diversity and inclusion.

More of the samebull$hit. We need more minorities, stat! I don’t care where you find em, get them in the positions! The only way to combat racism is with swift racially based hiring practices! All this is going to blow up in your stupid faces. 
This was an intelligent and well written article. This #FacultySoWhite business is a problem at UCLA too. In fact a Black male teacher at UCLA spoke to the Daily Bruin about how he’s tired of not seeing other ethnic groups represented in the faculty at that school. 
I don’t go to USC and never have. But I know plenty about USC. The vibe around USC is that of White Privilege and undercurrent racism. 
Yeah you can get a great education there at USC, and have your ticket written for future success after you graduate. But is it worth it as a Black man or woman unless you’re an athlete? The high tuition. The loan debt after graduation. Not NEARLY enough Black representation in the student body and faculty. The racism that you know is brewing behind your back at the school. 
Even if I got a scholarship to USC I wouldn’t go there. I like diverse campuses. Give me a CSU school over USC or UCLA any day. 
I aint selling my soul academically or monetarily just to get a piece of paper that says I graduated from USC or UCLA.
Nobody is begging you to go to USC or UCLA. You act like you’re a shoo in for both schools…Besides, there are lofty standards at both school if you want to attend. Don’t know if you can meet them. Hahaahahahah!!!
Uh shut up you dork. It’s clear you don’t have the requisite IQ to comprehend paragraphs. 
And for your information I have the GPA, the out of class background, the grades, and the transfer/articulated classes to get into USC or UCLA.
So I just made you look really stupid. Oh, I forgot you were already an idiot before this article came out. My mistake.
Somehow the professor can teach better when they are in the certain skin color? I think the author is a racist.
I think you’re ignorant. Did you even get the point of this article? God I swear the school system failed another student.
You shouldn’t have said anything about this article in this forum. 
You should have kept your mouth or fingers AWAY from the keyboard closed on this topic.
“Imagine taking a law class with a black and female tenure-track professor. The natural intersectionality of her academic experience could potentially expand her research and teaching to include diversity into the study of law.”
This a blatantly racist statement. I think it’s the content of the education, the knowledge and thoughts of the teacher that matters, not his/her skin color.
Preach.
Good Lord.  Didn’t the author get enough of this BLM crapola from the Academy Awards?  When you find some qualified professors who happen to be whatever color is in vogue, then hire them.  But if the aim is to hire professors based on the color of their skin rather than the power of their intellect, then the ultimate dumbing down of the university is what you’ll get.  And while we’re on the subject of racism, Bernie Sanders made a racist statement the other night that the media has conveniently glossed over:  “You don’t know what it’s like to be poor if you’re white”.  Put that in your hashtag and smoke it.
God, you’re on the dumbest and most insulated clowns I ever came across on social media. Idiots like you know NOTHING about institutional racism or intelligent topics like what was discussed in this article.
You sit up here with this ignorant rant and of course the failure to understand the premise of the article. Do you know how to comprehend complete sentences? I guess not.
I don’t think there is systematic racism in academic recruiting process. African american earned less than 3% of doctorate degree in most of the academic fields.
Does this mean you’re not inviting me to either your birthday party or next year’s Oscar viewing party?  I am all broken up LAC.  By the way, you forgot the k-e-y.  Lackey.  There.  Fixed it for you.
Do you have proof of all your accusations, or is it the zeitgeist to pull the race card?
Research? The research and proof is in your face and in the media every darn day to prove that institutional racism is alive and well in 2016. Are you and the two brain-dead idiots who liked your comment REALLY that stupid? I guess so.
You are your own worst enemy. 
People who pull the race card need to fill that big chip off their shoulder. Don’t be mad dawg. Don’t trip.

While I consider myself to be a pretty social media-addicted millennial, I’m constantly discovering new features on Facebook. It seems that new products are being launched on the platform everyday; Lyft and Uber integration, reactions and Facebook Live are all just 2016 developments. Here’s a roundup of three Facebook features I noticed recently that will help you optimize your usage.
1. Search Notifications in For Sale Groups
Caitlin Tran | Daily Trojan
After my bike was stolen last semester, I had to start my hunt for a new one during a time when not many people were selling theirs. I searched in the USC Free & For Sale group but had no immediate luck. Interestingly, I was presented with the option of getting a notification when new items were posted in the group that matched my search term. I turned it on and, lo and behold, was notified a week later when somebody was looking to part with their bike!
2. Trusted Contacts for Account Recovery
Caitlin Tran | Daily Trojan
On your Security Settings page, you’re given the option to “Choose 3 to 5 friends that you can call for help if there’s ever a problem with your account.” The next time you have trouble logging in, you can request that each of your Trusted Contacts will receive a security code with further instructions for you. Once you have all three security codes, you’ll be able to enter them into Facebook to recover your account.
3. Post Notifications
Caitlin Tran | Daily Trojan
On Facebook profiles or pages, you can opt in to receive a notification for every time a post is published.
With Springfest rapidly approaching, you’re going to want to turn on this feature for when USC Concerts Committee announces their official lineup!

Kate Guarino | Daily Trojan
Because I’m currently on my way to France, I’m going to begin with a bit of wisdom from French novelist Marcel Proust: “The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes.”
One of the greatest things about studying abroad in Europe is it allows people the opportunity to travel to a variety of different countries for relatively cheap. Many of my classmates and I were already planning weekend trips before we even arrived in London for the semester, trying to squeeze in as many trips as possible. It makes sense. Most of us don’t know when, if ever, we will have an opportunity like this again.
I’ve taken a few weekend trips so far, and I’ve discovered that there is some truth to what Mr. Proust had to say. Don’t get me wrong; I’m a fan of seeking new landscapes but traveling about Europe should be about more than just seeing the sites. One of the most important and also the most difficult things is to balance your inner tourist with the desire for a real cultural experience.
Take Scotland — for my first weekend trip I didn’t venture outside the U.K., but Scotland was still so different from being in London. We spent two days in Glasgow and about a day in Edinburgh. Edinburgh is a much more popular tourist destination and with good reason. You’ve got beautiful castles, highlands and a royal mile full of great pubs and shops. But of the two cities I actually preferred Glasgow.
A friend of mine and I went to see our classmate in an Irish dance competition. Sure, we saw the sites: We walked through the University of Glasgow, marveling at the cozy yet scholarly feel of the place, and we went to the Kelvingrove Museum where we saw Salvador Dali’s famous painting “Christ of Saint John of the Cross.” But my favorite experiences were those that really gave us a flavor of the city… And yes, most of them involved food.
We spent two hours eating possibly the world’s best burger at a place called Bread Meats Bread (see photo) and the next day had a full Scottish breakfast. We caught a one-woman show at an old church that was converted into a pub, complete with a free pint and pie with each ticket. We wandered through the botanical gardens guided by a nice Scottish man who could not have been more excited to show us around.
We stayed at an Airbnb about 20 minutes outside of the city and though it was slightly inconvenient, I’m so glad we did. We got to see the countryside and chat with locals. We walked a mile into the town for dinner and when it started to rain, a cab driver offered to drive us home even though my friend and I had no cash to pay him. Scottish people are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. It didn’t seem to matter that it rained nearly the entire trip. We had a great time and left feeling like we really had a sense of what it was like to live in Glasgow. My friend and I agreed we’d happily move there after graduation.
The following weekend, I went to Amsterdam and I saw the sites… I mean really so many sites: the Anne Frank House, the Van Gogh Museum, the Rembrandt Museum, the Rijksmuseum and the Windmill. It was a great experience and Amsterdam is a wonderful city, outwardly far more beautiful than Glasgow.  But looking back, I couldn’t tell you much about the people or the culture. I ate some wonderful Poffertjes (small dutch puffed pancakes) and fries from a cone but we were so busy trying to see everything that any really dining experience or chance of chatting with the locals fell by the wayside.
There is something to be said for taking it slow. Each city is different, and maybe it’s true that in Glasgow there is simply less to see. Still, most of those museums and tourist attractions aren’t going anywhere any time soon. Hopefully, I’ll get to come back to Europe one day but even if I don’t, I would rather leave with a truer sense of the cities and their culture and be able to tell long and detailed stories about a few memorable experiences than rattle off a list of all the attractions I witnessed running around for a weekend.
So as I seek new lands in France this weekend, here’s to hoping I take a cue from Proust and have eyes for a little more than just The Louvre.

You’re sitting in Leavey studying for midterms, but the only thing that’s really on your mind is Cabo. In less than one week, your only worry in the world is going to be whether your tan is even or if you got the perfect picture of you and your friends for Instagram. But with spring break comes its own set of concerns like the fact that you will be spending 70 percent of your time in a swimsuit. Here are some simple and easy-to-follow pointers for how to mentally and physically prepare for Spring Break 2016.
Okay, so this is a tip that should go without saying because it is of utmost importance to stay hydrated if you want to stay healthy. Make sure that you bring a water bottle with you wherever you go, and if you are going to be in Cabo, only drink the bottled water!

Worried about whether your bikini bod is ready to go? Rather than waiting on that elevator for ten minutes, try taking the stairs! Those extra steps will get your heart rate going and blood flowing and after a long day of sitting in class, is an easy way to burn off a few extra calories.
 
3. Brush your teeth right when you get home.
You may be that one person who has Domino’s on speed dial, with pizza ready to go the minute that you leave the 901 Bar & Grill. But, trust me, if you get in the habit of brushing your teeth right when you get home from going out, you’ll thank me in the morning when you wake up feeling great. This is a great way to save yourself from those late night munchies and those extra calories.
4. Vitamin C!
Let’s face it: there’s nothing worse than catching a cold the week before spring break. So make sure to take your vitamins –– especially Vitamin C to keep your immune system in tip-top shape!
 5. Don’t skip meals!
Skipping out on meals might seem like a good idea to cut down on calories, but it’s really the opposite. Eating more frequently in smaller meals is a better way to stay full longer and to make sure you are getting all of the nutrients that you need. If you skip out on meals, you will only end up eating more in the long run.

For lovers of literature, subverters of the status quo and do-it-yourselfers alike, one event delivered hands-on entertainment and creative growth. The L.A. Zine Fest, featuring more than  200 zine vendors, took place in Los Angeles’ own Majestic Downtown this Sunday, March 6 from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The L.A. Zine Fest, originally founded in 2010 and currently in its fifth year, celebrates local writers and artists who compile their works in small batches of self-published magazines. The festival was the culminating event wrapping up L.A. Zine Week, a seven-day circuit of live readings, workshops and special sales dotting the downtown area.
Unsurprisingly, the event was a wild success, going over capacity as visitors clamored elbow-to-elbow to make their way by the booths. “This is the biggest turnout I’ve ever seen at a zine festival,” said Vince Roque, festival volunteer and publisher of Like Like Zine. “Vendors have come from all over the country, and the diversity is incredible.”
The welcoming and interactive ambiance at L.A. Zine Fest was unlike that of any other art event. Vendors encouraged passersby to assemble their own zines, subscribe to mailing lists and even trade physical publications. Taylor Collins of 3451 Zine, which focuses on themes of afrofuturism and feminist science fiction, appreciated the openness of the zinemaking community. 
“Zines are a friendly medium, and we have a lot of creative license when working on them,” Collins said. “A lot of the visual art is about finding the beauty in everyday things, like a dirty street in West Hollywood as opposed to the famous, cliched Hollywood sign.”
The festival itself also offered attendees supplemental activities and seminars that showcased topics of presentation like zine archiving, the feminist movement and racial inequality. Offsite events were held at L.A. mainstays like The Last Bookstore, Spring Street Bar and The Falls Lounge. Collaborators of the festival included local advocacy groups such as Nalgona Positivity Pride and Project Intersect, and even public schools whose students read from their own zines.
Since the inception of zinemaking– which arguably began with Thomas Paine’s 1775 pamphlet Common Sense — the printmaking form has been lauded for its capacity as a vehicle for free 
speech and taboo topics left unaddressed in mainstream magazines. L.A. Zine Fest’s panelists explored the liberating quality of zines in various talks; in “Writing Ourselves into Existence: DIY Publishing as Feminist Resistance,” attendees learned about the relationship between publishing and reclaiming selfhood as women, and the panelists of “Racial Disparity and the Plight of the African American Female” similarly addressed issues surrounding the African-American experience as expressed in speaker Sarah Gail’s own zine.
The headlining act, “Alice Bag and V. Vale in Conversation,” appealed to zinesters’ anarchic and riot-grrrl sensibilities, as both speakers had roots in the 1970s. Bag, a punk musician and activist, distributed her book Pipe Bomb for the Soul — a tale of post-revolutionary socialist Nicaragua. Vale, a prolific self-publisher who founded San Francisco’s first punk-rock zine with the help of famous Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, ran the booth of RE/SEARCH Publications, of which he is the sole proprietor.
Zines were not the only works that exhibitors had on display. A special section of the Majestic was dedicated to independent video game creators who brought monitors and tablets for attendees to engage with. One such game was reVAMP created by Ashley Zeldin and John Nesky, directors of grassroots gaming company Adorkable Games. Zeldin, who graduated from USC in 2008, conceived the game at this year’s Global Game Jam, a game-creation convention. The game follows the Jam’s chosen theme of “ritual”: it prompts the player to perform the ritual of applying makeup in the morning– except on the absent reflection of a vampire — only to see the botched results afterward.
Another special feature of L.A. Zine Fest was its roving zine library, where donations from past festivals were displayed and made available for public perusal. The festival’s iteration of the zine library is just one of many in the city — concert enthusiasts can find one at grimy DIY venue The Smell, and UCLA’s Powell Library has its own fixed collection. This year, exhibitors had their own library to feature works — a way for attendees to overcome the social barrier of “shyness and crowds,” as stated by the L.A. Zine Fest site. At these makeshift libraries, curious readers sifted through bins of zine material at their leisure and were provided with a cozy pillow fort to relax and read in.
Indeed, the festival represented all aspects of L.A.’s community of independent makers, activists and content creators. KChung Radio, an independent station based in Chinatown, hosted a “Drink & Draw” event along with prominent radio station KXLU at The Falls Lounge for the musically inclined. Exhibitors like ¿Serio?, #Snatchpower and Nia King represented themes of social justice from minority standpoints. Unlikely zinesters like the mother-daughter duo behind the kid and i were also present at the festival.
L.A. Zine Fest’s influence is not limited to its annual exhibition. The group behind the event has worked with the Craft and Folk Art Museum, the Rock n’ Roll Camp for Girls, Meltdown Comics, Renegade Craft Fair and Unique L.A., among other organizations.
