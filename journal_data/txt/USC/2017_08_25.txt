The women’s volleyball team will begin the 2017 season with a match against Loyola Marymount this Friday. This match will present an opportunity for head coach Mick Haley and the women’s volleyball team to build momentum for upcoming matches in the next two weeks against No. 16 Michigan, No. 9 Creighton and No. 14 Kentucky.  
USC just missed the top-25 rankings with 105 points, about 40 points shy of No. 25 Purdue. As the season progresses, the Trojans will try to make their way up the poll as they return half of their starting lineup from last season.
The roster runs deep, and many of this season’s key players have been major contributors to the team’s successes since their freshman seasons. Sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier displayed her physical presence at the net and defensive abilities last season as a freshman recording 491 kills (4.06 kills/set) and 315 digs (2.60 digs/set), which are first and second on the team, respectively.  
She won’t be alone, however, as senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie, junior outside hitter Alyse Ford and junior opposite hitter Niki Withers also add depth to the lineup.  Abercrombie had 255 kills last season while hitting at a .246 percentage, Ford added 272 kills on a .220 percentage and Withers swung for 298 kills on a .253 hitting percentage. These four hitters will allow the Trojan offense to spread across the pins, providing balance that will be difficult for the opposing team to defend.
The Trojans may be fully loaded on the pins, but the middle position lost Elise Ruddins to graduation. Senior middle blocker Jordan Dunn returns, and there is potential in junior middle blockers Brittany Welsh and Madison Murtagh to make an impact for the Trojan offense and defense at the net this season. Welsh is a transfer from LSU, and will be making the adjustment to the Pac-12 standard of play.
“I’m really excited to be a part of the conference now and look forward to competition that has historically dominated in women’s indoor volleyball,” Welsh said. “I have also been fortunate enough to train with the team the whole summer, as it took time to adjust to the new system, but the girls were very helpful and super welcoming to all eight of us new players on the team.”
Any swings that get beyond this block will be in the defensive territory of junior libero Victoria Garrick, who tallied 182 digs last season.
Lastly, senior setter Reni Meyer-Whalley will run the offense. Another setter could be added to the offensive mix, since Haley has traditionally utilized two setters in a 6-2 offense due to Meyer-Whalley’s smaller stature.  
A 6-2 offense is when both setters operate solely from the back row, which provides a total of six hitters (two outside hitters, two opposite hitters and two middle blockers) available in the seven-player rotation, including the libero. This offense is especially effective for the Trojans because it allows them to utilize four pin hitters in a match instead of the traditional three used by many other teams.
In its quest for a deep playoff run, USC will be challenged in the Pac-12, which boasts 2016 NCAA champion Stanford, in addition to other strong programs in Washington, Utah, Arizona and UCLA.

While Thursday afternoon’s practice was closed off to the media, head coach Clay Helton gave a brief press conference, offering updates on preparation for Western Michigan and injuries to important starters. 
Preparation for opener continues 
This week, USC’s practices became specifically centered around game-planning for Western Michigan as opposed to the season in general. Helton sees the team as a very formidable opponent who should not be overlooked, despite the its second game against Stanford being a more high-profile matchup. 
“I look at Western Michigan as an extremely dangerous team,” Helton said. “The more I study their personnels defensively and how many guys they got returning back on the defense, I’m going into every game like it’s a playoff game.” 
Helton also shed light into how Saturday’s scrimmage would function in terms of getting the team ready for game one. 
“It’s going to be mainly the first team [offense against the] first team [defense], but we’re going against Western Michigan looks,” Helton said. “This is a situational game-day atmosphere. We’re going to actually portray us playing Western Michigan from the service teams on offense, defense and on special teams.” 
Helton noted that the game simulation would not only apply to players but also to coaches, as a few will call plays from the booth just as they will a week from Saturday. 
Injury Updates for Key Players 
On Thursday, Helton further elaborated on senior guard Viane Talamaivao’s absence from practice and offered a timetable for his return. Talamaivao sustained an injury to the foot and lower ankle, separate from the one suffered during spring ball.
“We just want to make sure it’s not a recurring thing,” Helton said. “Obviously a guy that’s been a three-year starter going into his fourth year, he knows the playbook inside and out, so it’s more important to get him healthy and ready to go. He should be ready to go on Monday.”
Helton also commented on the status of sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe, saying that he was “95 percent” healthy and very close to being back at full speed. The team’s second leading returner in receiving touchdowns has been limited in practice due to a nagging hip flexor injury. 
Helton Praises Depth at Tight End 
Even if Imatorbhebhe remains hampered entering the season, Helton is confident that the team’s other tight ends would be able to pick up the slack. He specifically lauded juniors Tyler Petite and Cary Angeline’s burgeoning chemistry with redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold, noting an instance where the quarterback connected with Angeline on a difficult third-and-long grab. The pair will be vital in rounding out the offense.
“To be able to have Cary Angeline, Tyler Petite and two young bucks Josh Falo and Eric Krommenhoek … we have a lot of tight ends right now that we feel are very capable of doing the job,” Helton said. “I hope we get Daniel back, I think he’s very close, but if not than it’ll be the next man up.”

freshman. Be more accurate when proof reading your article if in fact you do.

On Wednesday night, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Rich Hill was oh-so-nearly perfect. On most other nights, actually, he would have been. The 37-year-old lefty mowed down Pittsburgh Pirate after Pittsburgh Pirate — the first 24 hitters to face Hill failed to reach base.
Then, in the dying embers of the game, it all unraveled. A Logan Forsythe error in the bottom of the ninth ended Hill’s pursuit of perfection, and a home run from Josh Harrison an inning later ended the no-hitter, sending the Dodgers away with a 1-0 loss. Hill had to have been bewildered: He pitched more than a complete game, he hadn’t allowed a single baserunner before the extra innings began and he had the backing of one of the most formidable offenses in baseball. And somehow, he went home with an “L” by his name in the box score after pitching the best game of his career.
It’s strange, but Hill’s heartbreaking loss on Wednesday made me paranoid for the coming football season. The din of anticipation surrounding the USC squad has reached deafening levels, and many, myself included, have convinced themselves that an undefeated, championship-winning season is on the horizon, with a Heisman Trophy for redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold as a cherry on top.
The Trojans indisputably have the ability to rise to those crazy expectations. That’s why you find pictures of this team plastered all over every sports magazine in America. But the risk of chasing perfection in sports is that it only takes one mistake — a booted ball, one bad pitch out of 99 — to clobber your dreams of history into oblivion.
College football arguably embodies the chase for perfection more than any other sport in the world thanks to its short schedule and gargantuan pool of teams. The team that raises the national championship trophy in January has seldom lost more than one game all year (the most recent two-loss champion was LSU in 2007, which was known as the Year of the Upset). The best programs distinguish themselves through undefeated seasons.
No. 4 USC faces a tough road to a title, with no bye and a challenging out-of-conference schedule: The Trojans faced Arkansas State and Idaho back-to-back to open the year in 2015, the last time they were ranked in the AP preseason top 10. No such luck this season. They play a Western Michigan team coming off its best season in program history, a grudge match against No. 23 Texas and, of course, Notre Dame in South Bend.
Then the team has scores to settle in the Pac-12: snapping a two-year losing streak to Stanford, avenging the loss against Utah in Darnold’s first career start and keeping the Victory Bell painted cardinal.
It wouldn’t surprise me to see the Trojans clear every single one of those hurdles — like I said, the wealth of talent on this team is beyond doubt. But the pressure will only grow each step of the way, and though that may not make errors or bad luck more likely, a championship chase will magnify them.
And although USC achieved a lot in 2016, the squad has never been in pole position before. The beauty of last season’s Trojans was that they were perpetual underdogs after their 1-3 start. They relished the chase, and they shocked the nation with a Rose Bowl victory. But how will they handle being chased? To draw another baseball parallel, the 2016 Trojans were like Boston Red Sox pitcher Doug Fister on Tuesday night: He gave up a home run to the first hitter he faced, and then proceeded to throw a one-hit complete game. It was an incredible feat to be sure, but the weight of history got thrown off Fister’s back the minute his third pitch of the night got deposited into the right-field seats.
The Trojans won’t enjoy that luxury this fall. Every touchdown, win and weekly AP poll will be scrutinized and framed in a championship-or-bust mentality. After all, USC rose from the dead to win the Granddaddy of Them All last year — a national title is the only upward mobility left. In other words: Nothing short of perfection will do.
Recent history doesn’t flatter preseason-favorite USC teams. I don’t need to remind you: Plenty have re-hashed the disappointments of 2015 and 2012, the last two years the Trojans entered the fall ranked in the top 10. Though the duo of Darnold and head coach Clay Helton seems encouraging right now, people were also excited about Kiffin and Barkley and Sarkisian and Kessler.
Nevertheless, I may be a jaded sports fan, but I’m not a pessimist. Every championship run comes with incredible expectations and a near-zero margin of error, but one team wins every year. It’s silly to assume that USC will come up short before the team has played a single down this season. More importantly, Darnold, Helton and the rest of the Trojans — both players and coaches — aren’t the unproven, overhyped squads of years past. They may not have faced this level of pressure before, but they are battle-tested.
And if we learned anything in January, it was that these Trojans are at their best — and make history — when the pressure is at its highest.

Atlanta-based DJ Niko the Kid recently released his EP On the Run. In the past, he has commissioned beats for Akon and Gucci Mane, as well as remixed tracks for CeeLo Green, Tinashe and Parson James. On the Run represents his debut on the label Dim Mak, as he blends elements of electro, speed garage and futuristic R&B. While it may seem ambitious on paper, the EP fails to take any risks or break new ground. While On the Run has its redeeming qualities, it is mainly mediocre and fails to contribute anything of value to the music scene. 
“Love Me Not” is the most grating of the three tracks. The featured vocalist Shaylen, who appears on all three songs in the EP, sounds as if she wonders if the listener loves her or not. Her spoken delivery is flat, amounting to little more than background noise. There is no substance to the few lyrics the song includes and they are painfully recycled. Shaylen is desensitized, seemingly less sincere about getting an answer to her question and more about droning it into the listener’s skull.
An EDM track can survive vocal and lyrical flaws if the production holds up. Unfortunately, Niko also comes off as bored and lazy in “Love Me Not,”  using the same synthetic drum pattern the whole song. The drop can be anticipated from a mile away and ultimately arrives without any build-up or change in intensity. Instead, the synths lull in the background and almost no new elements are introduced. Still, despite being mindless and dull, it’s not entirely headache-inducing and could work well in the background when the listener’s focus is diverted elsewhere.
Fortunately for Niko, the title track “On the Run” outshines the other two. Shaylen wakes up from the curse she was under on the previous track and reveals decent vocal chops, this time sounding actually interested in what she is singing. She engages listeners by trying for higher notes in the chorus, then comes in with pitched vocals during the drop to add to the intensity. The lyrics are far from profound, but they are catchy and do a better job of engaging the listener.
The song itself starts out with synths that create a tropical vibe. As it builds, Niko adds in more synthetic sounds and a drum pattern that give the track an increasingly new-age feel. When Shaylen moves to the chorus, the track pulls back slightly before rushing in again, upping the stakes and creating urgency. There is an element of danger to the drop, actually trying to be interesting by throwing in different synth patterns every couple of bars. Overall, the track is danceable and fun, with enough edge to make it engaging, too.
“These Feels” falls somewhere in between “Love Me Not” and “On the Run” in terms of quality. Shaylen pulls off another serviceable vocal performance, but with less inflection it comes across as repetitive. She brings in a sultry delivery for the verses that doesn’t translate into the chorus, making the song feel fragmented. Lyrics are subpar and cliche again, only this time coming off more forced than boring. With lines about partying to forget “the feels,” the sentiments of vulnerability and optimism that Niko attempts to evoke simultaneously end up falling flat.
Niko’s production in this song has more bounce than the previous two, with warmer synthetic beats and faster pacing. Yet the drop feels like a more danceable version of “Love Me Not,” failing to come across as dynamic or interesting. The verses try to make up for this by waiting to throw in the drum pattern and using keys in the background, but it isn’t enough to save the track from being average.
In the end, the main thing that kills Niko the Kid’s EP is not that is particularly egregious but that it simply fails to experiment enough to maintain the listener’s attention. While “On the Run” is the standout, even it feels like any other DJ on the planet could have spliced it together on Garage Band. 
Ultimately, Niko the Kid has potential and so does his EP. Unfortunately, it suffers from trying to play it too safe. If listeners already enjoy EDM, this project is worth their attention. As for everyone else, while the project is decent, it’s not interesting enough to prompt further attention.

In Los Angeles, a world-class metropolis alive with the incessant hum of diversity and culture, there is no shortage of art or human expression. This fall, the city’s most prominent art museums will display a variety of new and captivating exhibits. Here is a guide to a few notable upcoming exhibitions: 
LACMA – Atmosphere in Japanese Painting
At its famed Pavilion for Japanese Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art will display a series of traditional paintings by Japanese artists that depict or evoke certain atmospheres, such as rain and fog, from Sept. 14 to Feb. 4. The exhibit aims to celebrate the linguistic nuances of describing weather and atmosphere in Japanese, a phenomenon that translates into signature ink paintings on silkscreens. Featured artists, who hail from both Japan and the United States, include Ikezaki Yoshio, Yamaato Kakurei, Senju Hiroshi and Miya Ando. 
MOCA – Axis Mundo: Queer Networks in Chicano L.A.
Putting a new perspective on both sexuality and race, Axis Mundo: Queer Networks in Chicano L.A. will shine at the Museum of Contemporary Art’s Pacific Design Center from Sept. 9 to Dec. 31. Organized by ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at USC Libraries, the exhibit explores the intersections and collaborative artistic efforts of queer Chicano artists from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. From showcasing the rise of artistic and cultural movements to significant events like the AIDS epidemic, the gallery offers a comprehensive view of a relatively obscure historic community. 
The Broad – Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors 
After showing from February through May at the Smithsonian Institute’s Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., this special exhibit of immersive infinity mirror rooms will make a stop at The Broad from Oct. 21 to Jan. 1. Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors is a significant project by 88-year-old Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama that aims to immerse visitors in large-scale mirrored rooms, paintings, sculpture and other mixed media pieces that collectively comment on the foundational concept of infinity. The Broad will be the installation’s second pit stop on its North American tour before it heads next to Toronto, Cleveland and Atlanta. 
Hammer Museum – Andrea Büttner 
In the latest of the museum’s Hammer Projects, German artist Andrea Büttner will unveil a collection of new photographs and woodcuts for viewing from Sept. 9 through Jan. 7. Büttner intends to impart a sense of littleness and humility in relation to nature and language in this new exhibition. Notable pieces include Büttner’s personal take on the Nativity scene and her woodcut, “Breadpebble,” a comment on the experiences of contemporary artists. 
USC Fisher Museum of Art – James hd Brown: Life and Work in Mexico 
Right on campus, the USC Fisher Museum of Art will present James hd Brown: Life and Work in Mexico, a deep exploration of Latin American art in context of Los Angeles from Sept. 19 to Dec. 2. His exhibit is one of more than 70 cultural institutions hosting art from Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA — a organization that collaborates with venues around the city to promote Latino art — across Southern California, from Santa Barbara to San Diego.

The internet went wild after Saturday Night Live’s summer spinoff Weekend Update aired Tina Fey’s witty commentary on the Charlottesville riots, dishing all forms of (seemingly) well-meaning criticism. Her satirical coining of the new political hobby “sheetcaking,” in which one purchases a sheetcake (“with the American flag on it,” Fey added) and consumes it whole to soothe feelings of political hopelessness, was for some all-too-similar to the laissez-faire politics of the privileged: Let them eat cake, in a sense. 
Of course, if you’re totally unfamiliar with Fey as an expert satirist (especially concerning contemporary politics) such criticisms might appear persuasive. But aside from the ongoing reality of misplaced righteousness on both the political left and right — a separate conversation — Fey’s spot captured something far more important, both for the country and this campus: You have a right to feel fatigued. 
Months after Inauguration Day, this country has been embroiled in a constant and ongoing national crisis, one political experts and analysts on both sides of the aisle have often characterized not only as a dysfunctional Oval Office, but also an empty one. Crisis after crisis has appeared in quick succession, each disappearing not after any real resolution, but after a larger, louder one appeared to overshadow it. What Fey’s satire characterized so perfectly was a hardly recognized national reality: The feelings of powerlessness provoked by our existing political landscape cannot simply be blamed on a lack of desire to make change. The idea of screaming into the ether as a last-ditch effort after months of ineffective donating, marching and protesting is not altogether an unrelatable one. After all, when can we admit that many of us have already felt our shock turn to a tired endurance, a marathon of civic obligation and moral prerogative? As Fey said herself: “Yell it into the cake.” 
At a time when we are (rightfully) concerned with the measures each citizen can take to ensure the preservation of a legalist, functional democracy, we are also concerned with how much of that we can do, and how much we can urge others to do: Calling, protesting, canvassing, donating, protesting, calling, donating, over and over — doggedly following the news, awake at night to remain informed and vigilant. As a people, we are tired. As a culture, we are tired. That, of course, is the nature of crisis. From impulsive threats of warfare to dangerously rookie international diplomacy to domestic strife and encouragement of racial violence and intragovernmental collusion, the cortisol levels of this country are high. The feeling Fey satirized was one that resounds with many of us: If we stop resisting, we will suffer more. When we continue to rally the power of the people to muster necessary public resistance, we still, to a degree based in and varied by privilege, also suffer. Fey’s bit was not meant to ask us to stop — rather, it urged the opposite. However, it also gave due credence to a longstanding national feeling that no matter how we might try, some national tragedies are beyond help, inescapable — the willingness of hundreds of fellow Americans to exercise their democratic right to free speech to advocate authoritarian Nazism, for instance. 
From what it seems, Fey’s satire was not meant to advocate inaction, but to represent the feelings of acute powerlessness on behalf of a nation that can feel its opposition to hateful ideology, from neo-Nazis to reactionary neoconservatives, becoming increasingly meaningless. When it feels like there is nothing you can do, perhaps, sometimes, there isn’t — try anyway. And if you need to scream into a cake afterward, don’t blame yourself. Somewhat ironically, Hillary Clinton herself accurately predicted this phase in our national consciousness. The final line of her concession speech: “Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap, if we do not lose heart.”

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Saturday marked USC Village’s grand opening to the public, and in addition to the new businesses, customers and students that the 15-acre retail and residential complex has drawn, it has also sparked heated debate. Last week, The New York Times praised USC for reenergizing a “neglected” community and creating thousands of jobs in an area struggling with high poverty rates. The Times went so far as to call on other American universities to follow USC’s example. 
However, in a special issue released this week called “The Making of the Modern Trojan,” we explored how business owners who had operated at the former University Village, as well as locals not affiliated with the University, have expressed frustration with USC for encroaching on and displacing members of their community once again.
The situation is nothing if not nuanced, but one thing is certain — USC’s acquisition of the University Village in 1999 is part of a damaging overarching trend. And for all of USC Village’s numerous community benefits, this trend throughout the University’s history has negatively affected the community in a number of ways.
The new USC Village was meant to be a symbol of the University’s emergence as a premier, world-class institution. But unless USC fulfills its obligations to its community and makes amends for a history paved with struggle and displacement, USC Village could become a symbol of unchecked greed and broken promises.
As USC has transformed from a commuter college into a residential university over the decades, and as its undergraduate population has surged in recent years, its need for land and resources to adequately serve students and faculty has grown exponentially. The University aims to provide a quality experience for this population, but this quality experience comes with a price — a price paid for by the neighboring community.
A 2015 State of the Neighborhood Report produced by USC found that more than 47 percent of families with children living in the University Park Campus area from 2008 to 2012 lived in poverty, which is close to double the rate of poverty of the rest of Los Angeles. The same report revealed a correlation between community displacement as a result of USC’s actions and higher poverty rates in the area. And as the local population has decreased over the years, the number of families struggling with health issues has increased. Affected families could struggle for generations to come.
In many ways, minorities in the area have been hit the hardest. In 2012, the Human Impact Partners as well as Esperanza Community Housing Corporation compiled research indicating that in the USC area, the population of Latino and black residents not affiliated with USC had decreased by 15 and 20.3 percent, respectively, between 2000 and 2010, all while growing in other parts of Los Angeles. In this same time period, the population of white residents not associated with USC grew by 6.9 percent. This suggests community displacement spurred by USC has, however unintentionally, contributed to establishing an environment hostile to people of color. 
At this stage, it is crucial that USC acknowledges the toll of its maneuvering on the surrounding community while USC Village is in its early days. Only by taking responsibility for its past, and taking concrete actions to bridge divides and create a better future, can USC effectively emerge as a leading institution. 
USC Village is young and it is not too late for the University to consider and learn from its past, engage with and listen to the voices of the surrounding community, and use USC Village and its resources to create positive change. One example of how USC is already attempting to do this is the development of new Village Residential Education programs in the works that will bring students into the South Central L.A. community to engage with locals. Additionally, the University should continue to fulfill its economic obligations to these members of the community by regularly hosting job fairs, job training events and adult classes.
As USC looks to build a brighter future with the surrounding community, it should connect students to the community’s youth with mentoring programs in the new residence halls. And students, faculty and publications, such as the Daily Trojan, need to keep USC accountable to these promises.
USC Village’s grand architecture, prestige and entrepreneurial spirit have the potential to mark a fine legacy that the University could take pride in for generations to come. But whether or not this is seen to is entirely up to USC. The University can choose to deliver on promises and be proactive about devoting resources to healing and supporting the community, or ignore its dark legacy and, in doing so, build upon it.

USC has joined the Alliance for Southern California Innovation, a non-profit collaboration between universities, research institutes and businesses to expand the biotech entrepreneurial space of the Southern California region. 
Steve Poizner, a serial tech entrepreneur and former California insurance commissioner, is leading the alliance, with plans to grow the region’s start-ups to the level of that of Silicon Valley’s by 2025. 
“Southern California has the right building blocks to become the next leading technology and innovation hub in the United States,” Poizner said in a press release. “Through a collaborative effort, the region has the potential to bring a trillion-dollar economic impact to the state and country.”
Randolph Hall, USC Vice President of Research and a professor of industrial and systems engineering, will represent the university in the alliance, alongside other administrators from Southern California universities. 
“This is a region that educates a huge number of engineers and scientists,” Hall said in an interview with USC News. 
In 2017, USC had over 950 undergraduates and 3,100 graduate students who completed degrees in engineering and computer science, according to Hall. 
The alliance would be an opportunity for the University to contribute to the biotechnology industry’s growth and also help students find roles in the field, Hall said. 
President C.L. Max Nikias declared his vision for a biotech community in the Health Sciences campus in June at an event at the Keck School of Medicine. 
“We are hoping that this new consortium will bring more power through the weight of collaboration,” Hall said.

In February 2017, graduate student Staci L. Young founded USC’s first Student-Parent Association (SPA). This organization consists of currently enrolled USC students of all levels who are either pregnant or parents. 
Young, a Master of Communication Management student, single-handedly founded the organization before it was recognized by the University. 
As the organization’s president, Young focuses on augmenting the size and awareness of SPA on campus. So far, the Student-Parent Association includes 60 members. 
“Right now, I am making sure that other students are aware [of student parents in the USC community],” Young said. 
SPA’s mission is to establish a close-knit community that enables student-parents to connect with each other for personal and academic support. 
Student-parents are exposed to existing resources to facilitate their time at USC. Resources range from receiving assistance with housing, to childcare and additional campus resources. 
However, SPA also has a large focus on increasing the amount of resources available to student-parents at USC. Young stated she founded the organization because there were no university organizations that supported or understood the underappreciated student-parent population. She wanted members of the Trojan Family and beyond to recognize the situation of these students who do not receive enough exposure and their individual circumstances. 
“There was no data about [student-parents], no types of forms or anything that marked a student acting as a parent [while attending college],” Young said. 
SPA aims to advocate for the student-parent community by encouraging transparency on campus. SPA also hopes  to increase USC’s understanding about the daily challenges student-parents face. 
“Our biggest focus is trying to get USC to see that you have a need to address these issues, since there are a lot of other schools that are addressing them,” Young said. “USC isn’t really doing that great of a job yet.” 
Unlike other institutions, such as UCLA or the University of Virginia, USC does not provide the needed support that Young sees a demand for. 
“[UCLA, UVA and similar campuses] have a lot of resources available for their student-parents, such as a resource center or even a specific website that people can log into,” Young said.
SPA has plans to additionally create a community in which the children of student-parents feel welcomed and included on campus.
The association has discussed organizing kid-friendly tailgates that would both benefit the parent and their child.
“We are young students — we want to have that same experience, but be able to include our kid,” Young said.
Other activities proposed to integrate children into the USC community include educational programs.
“We’ve also talked about having monthly visits to museums,” Young said. “That way, our kids feel like they are part of the community because we can get them involved.” 
SPA advocates keep an open mind to students who have unique backgrounds, while also working to build acceptance among students about other students’ circumstances. remind the 
“Not every student is going to be your typical 18-year-old coming into college,” Young said.Elizabeth Kirillova
The organization currently advertises its presence on campus through the USC Student Portal, social media and word of mouth.  
 
I love this! Thank you Staci for founding this group. USC needs more resources for student parents!
