USC’s Beyond Coal Campaign provided a forum Monday with more than 100 faculty members, students, community members and political leaders in attendance to discuss the university’s transition to clean energy.

Forty percent of the energy used by USC comes from two major coal plants outside the Los Angeles area, according to a handout produced by USC Beyond Coal Campaign. In 2009, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa announced the city would stop its use of coal by the year 2020.
“The commitment is still there, how quickly L.A. gets there is the issue,” said Romel Pascual, deputy mayor for Energy and the Environment.
Jeffrey Richardson, president and CEO of Imani Energy, INC., said he regards USC as the leader in moving toward a carbon-free future.
“Universities are the ones controlling a lot of land and energy,” Richardson said. “If the largest purchaser, USC, moves, everything will change.”
To make Villaraigosa’s commitment to the city a reality, USC student-based organizations such as the Beyond Coal Campaign, are asking for the assistance and support of the administration.
“Vice President [of Administration] Todd Dickey is on board with the campaign, but there is a difference between support and concrete steps,” said Henry Symons, a Beyond Coal organizer.
Proposed plans for a carbon-free university entail the termination of USC’s dependence on coal as an energy source, with solar energy in its place, said Mark Bernstein, managing director of USC’s Energy Institute. Bernstein also estimates clean energy, such as solar energy, will help improve energy efficiency by 20 percent at USC. These are only proposed ideas, however, and nothing has been written yet.
Bernstein suggests panels could be installed easily on all new, non-historic USC-owned buildings. The installation of solar power will in turn alleviate the university’s dependence on coal.
“We are the institution for change, if we stop buying coal it can have a huge ripple affect,” said Valeria Pentelute, a freshman majoring in economics, and member of the USC Beyond Coal Campaign.
Pentelute said the forum resulted in hope for a better, cleaner future.
“I’m so thrilled by the turnout and discussion. We are moving towards progress and there are so many positive arguments to be made against coal,” said Pentelute.
Tony Guan, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, and a member of USC’s Beyond Coal Campaign, said nothing is in writing yet, but support for the transition has been garnered from the student body, faculty and administration. USC continues to wait on a steadfast commitment from administration to transition away from their heavy coal usage.
The power ultimately lies within the ability of the student body to pressure administration for clean energy.
“The key to make it happen is grassroots organization … [Students] are customers on campus,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, an environmental group that aims to protect forests and wildlife areas.
Symons said an early start is key.
“The earlier we move, the more of a leader USC will be for L.A.,” Symons said.
Also, there must be some incentives under the California Solar Initiative that USC can take advantage of.  Are there any parties in the Stevens Institute working on solar tech?  
Also, to what extent is USC’s Green Symposium involved?
Plenty of flat roofs on USC’s campus for solar panels.  Several academic institutions have this in the works, and USC should follow suit.

Nearly everyone in Doheny’s Friends Lecture Hall raised their hand when Marissa Gluck, the panel moderator for “Privacy and Identity in the Age of Facebook,” asked the audience “How many of you have a Facebook account?”
The panelists at the event were Henry Jenkins, a USC professor of journalism, communications and cinematic arts; Whitney Phillips, a University of Oregon Ph.D. student; and Nathan Ruyle, an adjunct faculty member at California Institute of the Arts.
Jenkins said Facebook has become part of our culture and allows people to connect with friends from middle and high school. The information people put on their Facebook can define who they are, the panelists said.
“In the 1960s, people were disposable and there was no reason to build relationships,” Jenkins said.
Social networking forces people to think about how they present themselves to others on the Internet, Jenkins said.
Everything a person searches online remains on the cookies that store information on a person’s computer. Social networking sites can track one’s searches, according to Gluck, so marketers are now creating advertisements geared toward one’s specific interests.
Facebook has become a “marketing utopia” because it is used for a person’s own publicity and functions like a private marketing campaign, Ruyle said.
Some students said they were not aware that marketers and other individuals can collect information based on the websites a person visits.
“I didn’t think about data mining,” said Rihao Gao, a junior majoring in political science. “It’s pretty scary.”
Phillips suggested people try not to post things they don’t want their grandmothers stumbling upon.
“People post things they shouldn’t,” she said. “It’s important to make deliberate choices about what they put online.”
For instance, the “Asians in the Library” video posted on March 11 by Alexandra Wallace, a UCLA student, extended beyond her university and created negative press, according to Jenkins.
“Why would she post that,” Phillips said. “I don’t understand why people choose to do what they do on the Internet.”
Though Facebook has changed its layout and features, from privacy settings to personal information, several times since the site’s introduction in 2004, it remains up to the individual to determine what information they make available to others.
“Facebook has responded to that and you can now change settings to show your status only to certain people,” Phillips said.
Knowing this information, however, does not deter some students from posting personal information on their Facebooks.
“There are so many people here who have pinpointed all the things that are wrong, but we are all still on Facebook and updating our statuses saying ‘I’m at a conference about Facebook,’” said America Hernandez, a freshman majoring in political science.
How is it possible that the Daily Trojan publishes an article on almost every Visions and Voices event and yet the reporters never credit Visions and Voices? Seriously, DT?

The Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council will meet today to discuss the graphic photos of two individuals, one of whom is a member of USC’s Kappa Sigma chapter, appearing to have sex on the rooftop of Waite Phillips Hall on Saturday afternoon.
“[IFC] is appalled by the actions associated with the individuals in the pictures, and will work tirelessly to reverse the negative stereotypes such an action has perpetuated,” IFC president Pat Lauer wrote in an email.
Lauer said he cannot speak about sanctions being given to any IFC chapters right now, but he believes Kappa Sigma handled the incident properly. Kappa Sigma suspended the individual following the event.
“IFC is proud that Kappa Sigma has taken actions in governing themselves and their members by suspending the individual from their chapter,” Lauer wrote. “This is an individual issue and rest assured actions are being taken against that individual, but the affiliation of an individual should not be taken into consideration after an individual action.”
Mitchell Wilson, executive director of Kappa Sigma fraternity, said Kappa Sigma nationals is also currently investigating the incident.
“Any time you have a standards situation that has been violated, we have a due process to investigate the situation and determine the outcome,” Wilson said. “We are currently in the middle of due process for this individual.”
Denzil Suite, associate vice president of Student Affairs, wrote in an email that the administration became aware of the incident over the weekend and USC’s policy forbids unauthorized access to rooftops and other restricted areas.
“To say that we are disappointed in this type of behavior does not begin to capture [the] seriousness with which we regard this type of activity,” Suite wrote. “While I cannot speak to specific actions which will be taken with any individual, suffice to say that this type of conduct cannot go unaddressed.”
Suite said events like this should remind members of the university to present themselves in public the way they wish to be seen.
“When we are out in public, you should ask yourself if you would be concerned if your family, friends, professors, and others see your actions,” Suite wrote. “If the answer is yes, then perhaps you should not be engaging in the behaviors.”
I’m mostly pissed that all the doors to rooftops are now going to ACTUALLY be monitored by video rather than being guarded by pieces of paper falsely claiming video surveillance
Since when do we expect the Greek Community to have manners ?  I bet every building has secured its’ “easy access” to the rooftop. Talk about getting a ‘higher education!’ This gives new meaning to the WPH building, Women Prefer Heights.
I think I am actually most disappointed by the Greek females in all of this. Most colleges across the US have guys who would do it on the roof of a building, but it takes a special breed of female to actually make it happen. USC sorority girls bring on their dirty reputation all on their own through their behaviour… Stereotypes about USC sorority girls aren’t necessarily stereotypes if they’re true.
Regardless, all Greeks are despicable, especially the girls
You understand that the girl involved in this incident goes to UCLA, right?
This guy also posted the pic on CL OMG!
what ever happened to doing something like that at night so no one can see you? did they HAVE to pull a nooner on the roof? Really. I dont really care, and no one is in danger of being hurt or scarred by the this, but it is a really stupid move.
i saw all the pictures online. pretty easy to find. oh man…. he is definitely famous now but would have serious issues applying for a job given his behavior. but who  care’s if he is a porn star…right??? LOL
Dara is a bro hater.
I have no sympathy for these two idiots. They reflecting badly on all of us in the Greek community and the school.
So it turns out that the American Pie wasn’t in complete discordance with the Amreekan culture… lol… Fight on!!!
The new cover-up begins!
Bella, there is nothing to cover up.  Two people had sex.  OMFG, OMFG, OMFG!!!!  Let’s hang them by Tommy Trojan.  That will restore moral order to society.
Bella is an idiot. She posted in the comments thread of the other article about this story that she thought the girl in the photo was being anally raped. Apparently the concept of two people having consensual vaginal sex in public is incomprehensible to her (she also doesn’t seem to understand the mechanics of vaginal doggystyle sex).
I thought it was pretty funny.
[…] More here,  here, […]
[…] Council and Panhellenic Council, as well as the national office of the Kappa Sigma fraternity, the Daily Trojan […]

For all you underclassmen Trojans fans, a word from the wise: brace yourselves.
I know basketball season just ended and spring football practice is just beginning, but recent action in both sports are bad omens for next season.
Big void · The USC men’s basketball team will need to replace the production of senior forward Alex Stepheson, pictured here, next year. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The most recent bad basketball news came over the weekend when junior forward Nikola Vucevic decided to skip his senior year and declare for the NBA draft. Great for the young man’s career, horrible for a Trojans basketball squad that barely squeaked into the NCAA tournament even with his help.
Vucevic’s 17.1 points per game led a USC offense that was otherwise inept. The Montenegro native’s early exit leaves the Trojans with no reliable scoring presence. USC ranked ninth in scoring offense in the Pac-10 this season and could struggle to score even more next season if you can each imagine such a thing.
USC also loses Marcus Simmons, the team’s best perimeter defender, Donte Smith, its best perimeter shooter and Alex Stepheson, its most imposing physical presence.
To recap: USC loses its leading scorer, its best defender, its best shooter and biggest body. You do the math.
True, there is some new talent coming in. USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s recruiting class features combo guard Alexis Moore, small forward Byron Wesley and 7-foot-1 center James Blasczyk. A lot of potential there, but there is also a lot to replace, especially for freshmen.
News from the football field is not any more encouraging. Spring football usually kicks off with a bang, but this year, it’s been more of a pop.
Maybe it’s the early morning start time, which the players — and certainly the media — are still adjusting to. Or maybe it’s the absence of about 20 players who are sidelined by injuries. Whatever it is, the energy level just isn’t quite where it needs to be.
A week of practice has revealed a glaring weakness that could make or break USC’s football season. The offensive line is a huge question mark at this point. Junior guard Khaled Holmes, who started all 13 games last season, is out with neck stingers and could miss the spring training entirely. Even worse, Holmes will likely make the switch to center, so he has less time to learn a spot he has never played.
Other than junior tackle Matt Kalil, the O-line will be relying on inexperienced returners, like senior Martin Coleman, redshirt freshman Giovanni DiPaolo, redshirt sophomore John Martinez and junior college transfers Jeremy Galten and David Garness. Point is, besides Holmes (if he’s healthy) and Kalil, there is basically no returning experience up front.
Throw in a few injuries in the wrong spots and the offensive line could be detrimental to the Trojans’ chances this season. It all starts with the big boys in the trenches.
Without protection, Matt Barkley won’t be able to get the ball to Robert Woods. Without dominant O-line play, there will be no holes for Marc Tyler or Dillon Baxter to run through.
If the Trojans can’t put up points, a lot of pressure will fall on USC’s defense to play mistake-free, which is a scary prospect for anyone who watched USC last season.
USC folks are going to expect coach Lane Kiffin to improve on his 8-5 record. They want to see the Trojans compete for the Pac-12 title and not get overpowered by Oregon and Stanford. Kiffin has his work cut out for him.
So does O’Neill, who will be entering what many have deemed a make-or-break third year. He had built up a lot of good will with the way he handled the post-O.J. Mayo/Tim Floyd era, then saw it evaporate after he got suspended during the Pac-10 tournament for getting into a verbal altercation at a bar.
The pressure is on both coaches and both programs. Whether looking at the hardwood to the gridiron, there are a lot more questions than answers. As it stands now, USC’s two biggest sports could be in trouble.
What to do? Hope for the best, but invest in USC’s women’s and men’s volleyball programs just in case.

DeMar DeRozan, Marcus Johnson and O.J. Mayo have electrified the Galen Center in recent years with thunderous slam dunks.
But before the Galen Center even opened, USC had arguably one of the highest-flying collegiate backcourts, featuring the highlight-producing duo of Harold Miner, a two-time NBA Slam Dunk Contest winner, and Robert Pack, the runner-up in the 1994 NBA All-Star Slam Dunk Contest.
Player turned coach · Robert Pack now uses his knowledge and experience from his NBA playing days to teach and mentor young guards. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
“We were a very athletic backcourt,” Pack said.
Pack left USC in 1991 ranking fourth on the Trojans’ all-time assist list after just two seasons, and went on to have a 13-year run in the NBA for six different teams.
Toward the end of his career, however, Pack suffered several injuries, and realized he needed to prepare for a career after his playing days ended.
“I began to think that I would really enjoy coaching,” Pack said.
Playing behind All-Star point guards Chauncey Billups, Baron Davis and Jason Kidd, Pack diligently observed and advised his teammates, and absorbed as much knowledge as possible from his coaches.
“I was competing with those guys for playing time, but I still took the time to teach those guys the things that I knew,” Pack said.
The New Orleans Hornets recognized his coaching potential, and hired Pack as an assistant last season, allowing him to briefly work in the state where he was born and raised, after a year as an assistant coach for the NBA Developmental League’s Rio Grande Valley Vipers.
This season, Pack is an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Clippers.
In addition to the typical scouting and game plan preparation duties, Pack is responsible for mentoring the Clippers’ young point guards. The Clippers have an experienced veteran starter in Mo Williams, along with two rookies backing him up in Eric Bledsoe and Willie Warren.
“The young guards that are just coming in do not know the league yet, so I do a lot of film work and different things with those guys,” Pack said.
In his summer league debut with the Clippers, Bledsoe showed his potential by scoring 17 points, but also displayed his inexperience, committing 10 turnovers.
Since that point, Bledsoe and Pack have become nearly inseparable, breaking down film together, perfecting Bledsoe’s jump shot and discussing the mental aspects of the game.
“[Pack] has helped me out with everything, teaching me things I will use the rest of my career,” Bledsoe said.
The improvement in Bledsoe’s game has been tangible. He has been a reliable presence off the bench and started when necessary.
“Eric Bledsoe, compared to where he was over the summer to now, is a completely different player,” said Clippers coach Vinny Del Negro. “Robert has spent a lot of time with him, and it shows.”
Coming out of USC, Pack was undrafted.
One of his biggest challenges as an assistant coach has been to keep players like Bledsoe, who received a guaranteed contract after being chosen in the first round of the 2010 NBA draft out of Kentucky, motivated.
“Not being drafted was something I used every day of career in the NBA,” Pack said. “I was always a driven person that worked very hard, but that was something added to keep me going.”
At times, it has been difficult for Pack to sit on the bench in a dress suit, watching the young point guards make what seem like obvious mistakes.
Nevertheless, Pack, 42, remains content, despite no longer playing, and has gained a greater appreciation for the effort coaches consistently put into their jobs.
“I realize that coaches work a lot harder than the players,” Pack said. “I am often up until two or three in the morning watching film. A lot of hours go into it.”
Despite the long hours, Pack aspires to be a head coach one day.
“I do not affect the game from a physical standpoint anymore. Instead, I am preparing and teaching,” Pack said. “It gives me great satisfaction to see these young guys have success, and get better and better everyday.”
He should be working for USC as their top asst. coach with much more experience than the staff combined now
has.

Junior Ricky Oropesa smiled after Sunday’s win against UCLA and said he couldn’t let the Georgia boys get all the home runs.
After outfielders junior Alex Sherrod and sophomore Alex Glenn, both Georgia natives, hit USC’s first six long balls this season, Oropesa hit his first two homers of the season over the weekend against rival UCLA.
Power stroke · Junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa hit his first two home runs of the season against crosstown rival UCLA this past weekend. He will look to continue his recent surge at the plate in USC’s nonconference game against UC Irvine this afternoon. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
The preseason All-American will look to continue a recent hot hitting streak today when the Trojans (9-15) take on UC Irvine (14-6) and a familiar face in former coach Mike Gillespie at 3 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.
Oropesa started the season slow, hitting .250 with only five runs batted in through the first 11 games. But USC interim coach Frank Cruz wasn’t worried. It was almost expected.
“Rick traditionally starts slow. It takes him a little bit of time to find his swing and get in the groove,” Cruz said in an interview earlier this month.
His freshman year, Oropesa hit a woeful .083 with two RBIs the first 12 games before finishing the season with a .314 batting average and a team-best 13 home runs and 48 RBIs.
Last year, it was a .176 start and five RBIs through the first nine games. Oropesa finished with 20 homers and 67 RBIs.
In the 12 games since the beginning of spring break, the slugging first baseman has hit .500 (23-for-46) with 13 RBI. He was named the Pac-10 Player of the Week yesterday after going 9-for-17 last week, including 6-for-13 against No. 24 UCLA.
Now that Oropesa has a couple of home runs under his belt, he feels like he’s finally got his swing where he wants it.
“I think I’m getting loose. It takes me a couple of [at bats],” Oropesa said. “It’s getting this rhythm up and staying with the same approach: taking good quality at bats and getting my pitch to hit.”
Oropesa will try to use his bat to help extend UC Irvine’s recent slide. After starting the season 13-1, the Anteaters have dropped five of their last six games, including a three-game sweep at Gonzaga over the weekend.
During its current five-game losing streak, UC Irvine has scored only four runs. It was shut out the last two games and hasn’t scored a run in 26 innings.
Freshman left-hander Kyle Richter will be charged with trying to continue UC Irvine’s hitting struggles. Richter, who has made eight relief appearances, will get his first career start as a Trojan.
“By the time he leaves USC, we have confidence he’ll be a weekend starter,” Cruz said. “So we’re going to give him an opportunity to work toward that now and see how he does.”
Though normally a coach would look forward to facing a team in the midst of a losing streak, Cruz adamantly disagreed.
“Hell no. I wish they would have won 10 in a row,” he said. “With coach [Mike] Gillespie, you know they will be prepared, especially after losing four in a row.”
Cruz said it’s “very difficult” facing off against Gillespie. He lists Gillespie as one of his closest friends and said he talks to him weekly. The two have known each other for more than 20 years, since Cruz was coaching at University High School and Gillespie was recruiting his players while coaching at the College of the Canyons, and later at USC.
Gillespie led USC to the 1998 national championship and three World Series appearances during his 20-year tenure as the Trojans head coach from 1987 to 2006.
From 1993 to 1996, Cruz served as an assistant coach under Gillespie before taking over his first collegiate head coaching job at Loyola Marymount.
“[Gillespie’s] probably the single most important influence in coaching and the reason I am coaching at ’SC today,” Cruz said. “It makes you elevate to the next level when you coach against a Hall of Famer.”
Cruz might be Gillespie’s understudy, but don’t expect Gillespie to take it easy on his former assistant.
“Everyone loves him because of how humble he is, but when he gets between the lines, his game face is on. The last thing he’ll be thinking about is our friendship,” Cruz said. “You have to be sharp or he’ll exploit you in a heartbeat.”

On April 16, 2011, Radiohead will release two new tracks, “The Butcher” and “Supercollider,” on 12” vinyls in celebration of Record Store Day. Supercollider has been previously performed during the In Rainbows tour and serves as a perfectly melodic, piano ballad containing that ever-so-unique Thom Yorke aura.  
Radiohead has consistently mastered public relations, given the sudden release of King of Limbs providing listeners with an unexpected surprise in addition to allotting listeners to name their price for In Rainbows, never failing to capture the attention of the media worldwide.  
Whether Thom Yorke and Co. are master manipulators of their fans or whether they really only care about the music is up for debate. Their Record Store Day release, however, is meant to attract attention to small, independently owned record stores in order to keep the music industry going for the little guys.  
Keeping with this theme, the two track vinyl is rumored to be released in a mere quantity of 2,000, only in record stores and, alas, not online.  For Coachella attendees, this may prove to be a difficult task given that they’ll be all the way off in Indio.
For a list of participating record stores check out the official Record Store Day website.

What do you get when you mix My Bloody Valentine, Nine Inch Nails and Smashing Pumpkins? One possibility is melodious indie-pop band The Pains of Being Pure at Heart. 
The Brooklyn-based group made its debut in 2007 when it released its debut self-titled EP. The album peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, and ever since, the band has continued to make progress with the release of its second album, Belong.
Although a band’s sophomore album can be the kiss of death, Belong is the opposite, proving Pains has improved its sound while still keeping its characteristic style.
This 10-track album blends memorable lyrics with dreamy vocals. Not a single track pales in comparison to the others, as Pains was so deliberate in the songwriting and production that the album’s release date actually had to be postponed.
Though there are no weak songs, some still stand out more than others. The track that stands out as the catchiest is “Heart in Your Heartbreak.” Released as the band’s first single in December, the song quickly garnered attention and caused increased anticipation for the band’s sophomore album.
With moving lyrics such as, She was the heart in your heartbreak / She was the miss in your mistake / And no matter what you take / You’re never going to forget, Kip Berman elicits emotions of lost love and evokes heartache in the listeners.
In contrast, the first track of the album, “Belong,” sets the coed quartet in a sea of distorted guitars and droning melodies. The distorted guitar’s explosive sound, about 15 seconds into the track, shows Pains is eager to shows growth and development during the last two years.
The entire album is laced with lyrics of teenage angst and heartache, which can be heard especially in tracks like “Even in Dreams” and “Anne with an E.” Both closely resemble love songs and mix quiet verses with sing-along choruses.
It is easy to hear a change in the band’s production, even though it has not strayed from its 1990s vibe. Pains has moved away from its fuzzy-noise pop-sound and toward a more mature one. The emotional combination of harsh lyrics and wistful vocals creates feelings of heartache while simultaneously conjuring a need to dance and feel good.
But don’t be fooled: The band did not do it alone.
To help bring the new tunes to life, Pains enlisted the help of producer Flood and ace mixer Alan Moulder. These two music geniuses have worked with numerous successful artists including U2, My Bloody Valentine, Smashing Pumpkins and P.J. Harvey.
The partnership between the band and its new production team is exemplified in “Belong,” with the original Pains sound becoming bolder, louder and more confident.
Pains has had a busy year with the production and release of its sophomore album, but the band is not wasting any time before beginning to tour. Pains recently played at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas and will continue to tour from the end of March through the beginning of May.
Ok people, it’s called an opinion.  I’m not sure what makes everyone an expert on their music or favorite band, but everyone is entitled to their opinion.  Love all the I think I know best references but you know what, you’re a legend in your own mind.  I’d prefer to hear what the band thinks of the review than you amateurs.
I’m a successful professional critic who wrote for the DT long, long ago. Looks like anyone can have an opinion on music now, now matter how uneducated on the subject they are. I was merely pointing out the faults in this reviewers comparisons and suggesting that next time, she actually do some research on the history of the music she’s writing about.
Nice try in thinking I’m some angry teenager, though!
OK, wow. DT, do you even hire kids who know anything about music anymore? POBPAH sound NOTHING like Nine Inch Nails or My Bloody Valentine; I’m convinced this girl doesn’t even know who NIN or MBV are, let alone has heard any of their music aside from a quite YouTube listen while she was writing this article. The Smashing Pumpkins comparison can only be drawn through the whiny vocals and the fact that the bands share a producer. Nice try.
The new POBPAH album is more closely aligned with the bands that made Slumberland famous, such as Rocketship, Black Tambourine and Velocity Girl — dreamy, washed-out indie pop. (But since the writer seems to know nothing about the history of indie music, she wouldn’t know to make those comparisons, right?)
So, Ms. McKenna: listen to “Belong” and those Slumberland bands I mentioned, then listen to “Isn’t Anything” and “Pretty Hate Machine” and you tell me which sound more similar.
Also, there are more words to describe guitars with than “distortion,” but there’s not much hardened distortion on “Belong” anyway! What’s that line from Princess Bride? “You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.” Yup.
Sounds like this guy gets a foot up his arse, but he’s 16, so we’ll wait until he’s out of his moms house.  
Two suggestions here you little angry guy behind his computer.  Maybe it’s time you get out there and do your own reviews.  Maybe you’ll be the next Cameron Crowe, just a lot less talented and a lot more angry.  
GET OUT THERE AND DO SOMETHING PEOPLE.  PUT THE KEYBOARD DOWN, LIVE LIFE, PARTICIPATE, AND AD SOMETHING SPECIAL TO THIS WORLD.  
To the angry blogger, I say get a life!
Cheers to all!
nope. the guy above ??? has it right. TPOBPAH sound nothing like or related to any of the bands listed in the review. NIN? are you kidding me? the closest resemblence from a band you mentioned is MBV but that’s still stretching. . .they don’t sound anything like the pumpkins either, everyone’s just saying that because they don’t know how to categorize this band so they take the lazy/easy way out and reference a band from the 90’s who used the same producer and has a little fuzz/distortion in their sound. . .like the guy said above, this band was influenced directly and sound like indie bands “rocketship”, “the softies” and bands from the infamous UK indie label sarah records like “aberdeen”, “brighter”, and “the field mice”. i strongly believe if people don’t know or don’t follow a particular band, that they refrain from righting a review on them or thier albums. . .i’m still laughing about the NIN comparison
btw. . .i’m in my late 20’s and i am at office typing this so i’m not a 16yr old living in my parent’s basement. . .

There are no lyrics on Röyksopp’s latest album, Senior. But by no means does that imply that Röyksopp has nothing to say.
To listen to Senior is to take an ethereal journey to that place in your mind where worry and stress cease to exist.
If there were a soundtrack for souls ascending to heaven, Röyksopp has made it. And don’t worry, you can bop your head along the way.
“With Senior we basically wanted to tell something about a stage in life that is yet to come for us,” said  Svein Berge of Röyksopp. “Mainly the later years where we imagine that if there is such a thing as a protagonist on the album, this person has to deal with things like doubt and also consequences for the choices that the protagonist has made earlier in life.”
Norwegian duo Torbjørn Brundtland and Berge have been making and mixing music together since they were minors in Tromsø, Norway.
Their ability to feed off one another in the studio resulted in a creative explosion of musical talent known to the world as Röyksopp.
Röyksopp established itself within the electronic genre with its first album, Melody A.M. The duo has left an indelible impression on the music world ever since, with a career marked by four albums as well as nominations for both a Brit Award and a Grammy.
“We like to be a bit ambiguous. That’s the kind of feeling we like to project onto the listener … you’re being taken somewhere and you kind of get it but not necessarily the full thing,” Berge said.
Oddly enough, the ambiguity that can be wrested from Senior is the result of a deeply engrained bond that Berge and Brundtland share over their music.
“Without asking Torbjørn, I will know whether he likes a specific count or not,” Berge said. “I will know whether he likes that snare or not because we are so in tune when it comes to what works or what does not work, or what we can do and what we cannot do.”
Berge describes the recording process and rituals in the studio as a collaborative and equal effort.
“We basically do the same thing. It’s not as if one has a certain role that is more dominating than the other,” Berge said.  We sit together side by side and do the same things, it’s the way we’ve always been working, and I think that’s where the energy lies.”
Fittingly released before Röyksopp’s Senior was the album Junior. Where Junior is the energetic wild child, Senior is the wise sage that offers listeners repose and introspection.
The two albums were made simultaneously but released separately. One the yin, the other the yang, together they imbue a balanced sense of vitality and gentility.
Röyksopp’s evolution and longevity as a duo has been aided by its ability to distill seemingly unfamiliar musical genres into something that becomes its own sound.
“I can listen to R. Kelly just as much as I can listen to Deadmau5 or Led Zeppelin … as long as it’s good it will do something for me and I think that’s also partially why we sound the way we sound,” Berge said.
Berge also admitted such appreciation for diverse sounds did not come early for him.
“When I was about 12 I was probably more dogmatic and strict in my musical preferences or selections than I am now,” Berge said. “I really hated anything that had guitars and smelt of anything acoustic but obviously I’ve softened a bit and I’m a bit more open now.”
Röyksopp will play at the Wiltern tonight and viewers can expect to see something best described as otherworldly.
“Some people might expect that we will do a Senior tour which I would assume would be more down tempo and introverted,” Berge said. “Those people will be disappointed. It will be a Röyksopp tour and it will consist of old classics as well as new hits. It will be the whole variety.”
The duo’s entire persona lies in eliciting a response from listeners and concertgoers.
“The main thing for us is to give people a feeling that evokes some sort of reaction,” Berge said.

Once upon a time, a pretty girl got lost in a scary forest only to be rescued by … a beast? A hunter? A bunch of little men?
Any of those will work for the multitude of fairy tale films from our childhood. We have all been inundated by these narratives, which often involve a damsel in distress, a handsome prince and talking animals or kitchenware. We know these stories like the backs of our hands, and now they’ve begun to resurface.
In the last month, we’ve seen Beastly, the high school version of Beauty and the Beast and Red Riding Hood, the dark Twilight-esque take on the classic tale. Countless more fairy tale films will be released in the next year and a half, with adaptations of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and more in the works.
So what’s motivating this onslaught of classic stories? Like all things in Hollywood, money is a big part of it. This year’s cinematic offerings are dominated by sequels, reboots and remakes, and to some extent, fairy tales provide the same kind of financial guarantee.
People go to movie theaters to see familiar stories and beloved characters, as well as to discover what new twists have been added.
On the more artistic side of things, fairy tales provide timeless, beloved narratives that are so simple and archetypal that they can be easily adapted for different settings and cultures.
As long as filmmakers don’t stray too far from the original tale, there is a guarantee people will be able to relate. After all, that is why these stories have stayed with us for hundreds of years.
But the disappointment from Beastly and Red Riding Hood could be bad news for the studios hoping to cash in on these age-old stories.
Beastly, released at the beginning of the month, featured a host of attractive young stars and was little more than a story of high school revenge and puppy love.
The negative reviews complained it didn’t live up to its source material or the classic 1991 Disney animated version. Not even Neil Patrick Harris, who played the ‘Beast’s’ blind tutor, could rival Lumiere and Cogsworth in our hearts.
Red opened the following week. Directed by Twilight helmer Catherine Hardwicke, the gothic fairy tale was expected to benefit from the franchise’s teen and tween devotees.
With the regular wolf exchanged for a werewolf, the film almost entirely abandons the original story in favor of gruesome deaths and multiple love triangles.
Red was panned for everything from terrible acting to an incoherent narrative.
Both movies came in third at the box office on their opening weekend to disappointing grosses. These two failed attempts at adapting classic fairy tales for an older audience set a low bar for the plethora of adaptations in development and discourage audiences from investing in fairy tale films produced down the road.
That still hasn’t stopped the studios from starting production on even more adaptations.
Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, starring Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton, and Jack the Giant Killer, an adaptation of Jack and the Beanstalk, will both drastically depart from their childish source material, though Hansel and Gretel is pretty gruesome in its own right, in favor of very grown-up violence. The tales, it seems, will serve as more of an excuse for action.
But Snow White seems to be the most popular fairy tale, with three Snow White films set for release next year. A more comedic adaptation stars Julia Roberts as a likable wicked queen. The next, titled Snow White and the Huntsman, features Twilight’s Kristen Stewart as the fairest of them all and Charlize Theron as the villainous second fairest.
With the ever-brooding Stewart, this version looks darker and closer to the original tale.
The last entry in the Snow White race comes from Disney, whose live-action update will be set in 19th century China and feature seven kung fu warriors.
As timeless as the story is, it’s doubtful the box office can support three separate iterations within a year of one another. Whichever one can strike the balance between originality and archetypal, familiarity will win out — or maybe it will just be the one released first.
Even if we get three forgettable films, along with multiple versions of other similar fairy tales, Snow White along with Little Red Riding Hood, Jack, and all the rest will be remembered.

Great article, Daily Trojan!  Your talent resonates with the reader of today as it did when I was an undergrad at S.C.!
Anyway, as a tenured marketing professor, mother of two girls, fairy tale writer (not my day job) I can tell you that a good story (not the same old tale) like the Princess Bride, Star Wars, Stardust will when on film will touch the viewer and transform them not just during the film itself, but long after the theater has gone black. People remember a good tale and a good fairy tale that is unique will transcend time and even what were at a time predictable short-term profits…Just imagine the revenue stream for the Brothers Grimm and good old Hans Christian Anderson…if they had found the Holy Grail of immortality…cha-ching, cha-ching!
Good article! Yet, being an author who writes for kids too, I guess every author/screen-writer should strive to create new creatures, the classical, öld like vampires, elves, dwarfs, wizards with sharp hats, fairies, etc. are too ordinary already? That’s what I try in some of my books (Tale Of The Rock Pieces, The Opposite Of Magic, Kids’Funny Business, etc – weightless korks, glowing, living balls, Brown faces, fiery men, one-eyeds, night fruit, rock pieces, fish-keepers, etc…), I guess I’m right? Unusual, new characters and creatures mean new, more interesting plots, many intriguing adventures and an end that no one could predict?

In A Better World tackles one universal question: How do we know what is right and what is wrong? Although the Danish movie won best foreign language film at the Academy Awards, there is nothing foreign about director Susanne Bier’s (Things We Lost In The Fire) examination of everyday decisions.
Anton (Mikael Persbrandt) travels between Denmark and Africa working as a doctor after leaving his two sons and scorned wife Marianne (Trine Dyrholm) behind. When Anton’s easily bullied son Elias (Markus Rygaard) starts being constantly harassed, a new student comes to his rescue.
Dynamic Duo · In a Better World presents a story about two children with very adult problems. The film has stellar performances and a narrative that presents important and universal themes of life. - Photo courtesy of Sony Picture Classics
Christian, brilliantly portrayed by William Jøhnk Nielsen, becomes fast friends with the timid Elias and displays an intense sense of revenge and anger, especially given his age. Christian’s absentee father Claus (Ulrich Thomsen) is hardly a model for managing emotions, as he struggles to cope with his wife’s recent death and his move from London to Denmark. As a result, the two young boys lean on each other for emotional support.
After a revenge plot against Elias’ bully comes close to serious penalty, the boys’ bond becomes dangerously one-sided, with the angry Christian as the stronger character. Anton remains involved with his own work in Africa and doesn’t realize his son Elias’ need for guidance. When Anton finally returns to Denmark, he’s involved in an altercation with hotheaded mechanic Lars (Kim Bodnia) as the two boys look on. Christian’s instincts kick in after Anton fails to fight back, and his revenge plot against the unruly Lars unfolds tragically.
Dramatic scenes of physical violence and raw emotion make a powerful statement in the film, yet there isn’t a single distinct message conveyed in In A Better World.
Perhaps due to Bier’s directing or simply the nature of the story, the themes of In A Better World are numerous, overwhelming and cause the audience to sometimes struggle with finding one moral point.
Although Christian’s new friendship with Elias could be easily taken as an anti-bullying message, Christian himself is not a paradigm of good behavior. He is at once a suicidal loner and a savior to another loner, and fails to convince the audience he is a good role model for Elias.
Although the audience learns that Christian’s mother’s death has weighed on him heavily, this hardly excuses his haphazard behavior.
Still, Nielsen’s emotional range in portraying Christian is astonishingly convincing, rivaling even the far more experienced Persbrant.
Anton, who touts taking the higher road against bullies and conflict, isn’t shown to be any more reliable or trustworthy than the angry Christian, seen as a role model for Elias in the end. Elias’ character does not offer hope at the end of the film, as he is still a pawn much like he was at the start, showing no validity in being a pacifist, a nerd or a “nice guy.”
What the characters show is an unidealized portrayal of humanity, the message being that people will be people and neither good nor greed will win.
These sensibilities make In A Better World a fitting title, since the realities of our world are not downplayed for a stereotypical happy ending in the film, and the viewer might come away wishing for the better life that never comes. Though mostly focusing on the world of everyday life, Bier creates a strong picture of human life in general.
Although at times predictable, Bier has created a dramatic and gripping film. Picturesque scenery and stunning cinematography makes the film’s visual appeal far more idyllic than its story, and that beauty alone is Oscar-worthy.
In A Better World is a powerful picture of the challenges the world forces us to face, whether we choose such difficult situations or they find us.

I by no means consider myself equal to the NCAA athletes who grace USC fields and courts.
But even though club teams don’t have players on scholarship or a paid staff to give post-game massages, club athletes still deserve some of the perks student athletes receive at USC.
Specifically, I think it is absolutely necessary to give our club sports teams priority registration.
USC’s club hockey team, which I am a member of, participates in the PAC-8 league. It is essentially the same conference as the Pac-10, just without both Arizona teams. We are a Division II American Collegiate Hockey Association team, and since the first week of September we have practiced twice a week and played games most Friday and Saturday nights.
For the weekend games this season my team traveled to San Francisco, Oregon, and Washington (on two occasions). Like most club teams, we were required to fly to our games.
Club hockey is not the only team with such a chaotic schedule. Rather, all USC club sports organizations require an ample amount of time from their members.
Normally, this would not matter much. It becomes a problem, however, when club sport athletes have Friday morning classes they are forced to skip to make it to the field, court or rink.
If club athletes were able to register for classes alongside the NCAA athletes, club sports athletes could create a schedule that would have leave Fridays free for travel.
Instead, I ended up having to skip four Friday morning linguistics discussion sessions, and ultimately my grade in the class suffered, because I was unable to receive the same in-class knowledge as my fellow classmates.
Students shouldn’t have to skip classes to participate in their extracurricular activities. By allowing club athletes priority registration, we wouldn’t have to skip classes and fall behind on our work.
Often this season, by the time we arrived at the rink, we practiced for two hours and did not get off the ice until at least 1 a.m., which meant we didn’t return to campus until just before 2 a.m.
This is not news to other club sport athletes, who are used to returning to campus when many students are sound asleep.
If USC’s administration allowed club teams the ability to register for classes before the rest of the school, we would be able to make a schedule that allowed us to sleep in more and recuperate on Tuesday mornings as well.
As a highly-regarded institution, USC clearly prioritizes academic performance. Extracurricular activities and social development follow.
The members of our hockey team, and those of other club sports teams and organizations, understand our obligation to academics.
Nevertheless, we cannot simply sacrifice the activities we love when there is a way to stay active in them — while still performing in the classroom.
Although none of us will go on to play professionally or make a career out of the sport we love to play, we shouldn’t have to give it up because we aren’t able to attend class. Priority registration serves as a feasible solution.
I would like to play on USC’s team for the remaining years of my college career, but doubt I will be able to continue unless someone within the administration steps in and sees our team as deserving of priority registration.
Club sports teams bring together many student leaders, all of whom will go on to succeed in engineering, business and other major fields.
We tend to define ourselves by our major instead of the sport we play, and it would be a lot easier to function within both the academic and athletic spheres if club athletes were given priority registration during the scheduling season.

This is completely backwards. You should get to register first for classes because classes are less important to you than sports? People who care the most about their classes should be registering first for classes – not the “jocks”
And it’s all a bit besides the point – why does it have to be a zero-sum situation where some lose and others win? Maybe you should spend your time working to make sure there are enough classes available so everyone can get the courses they want and then you won’t need to argue about who registers when.
Why is sport more important than other activities? I know a lot of people who don’t give a damn about sport, but invest their time and energy in political, religious, or social activities.
You sum up the problem fairly clearly when you say:
“Although none of us will go on to play professionally or make a career out of the sport we love to play, we shouldn’t have to give it up because we aren’t able to attend class.”
Basically, you don’t want to give up something you love in order to go to class. If everybody else has to,
(whatever that may be – politics, drinking, even romance) why shouldn’t you?
(As for NCAA athletes; they bring income to the school. They’re more of an financial asset than a student; that’s why they get privileges.)
I played club sports in undergrad (rugby – we were ranked in the top 10 nationally – and hockey).  I would have 3 hour practices 3x a week on top of  ice time whenever it was available (luckily we had a rink at our rec center).  I also worked part-time at the bookstore (FYI we had to get NCAA athlete’s books for them…. wth) oh and I was service chair for my chapter/organization.
I admit, registration was tricky and going to tournaments required a lot of finessing with professors…
All that being said – I had a chaotic schedule because I chose it.
Sometimes I wish I would have been talented enough in a sport to get a full ride and not worry about a lot of things (e.g student loans). Then again, I had student athlete friends who felt as though the school owned them. They had to wear Nike everyday and put ID tags on their backpacks. They would have grueling work outs in the am and pm. They had to miss a lot of class, even if they didn’t want to and even if they knew that they wouldn’t “go pro” and this free education actually meant something….
So I guess what I’m trying to say is – yeah, it sucks that club sports don’t have a lot of the same perks that NCAA sports do. But, you need to look at the trade offs…. Namely, freedom and choice.
An alternative would be to transfer to a school with an NCAA hockey team.
Maybe you should get your hockey team to be a NCAA sport.
He can’t. Thank Title IX.
Or hey, how about USC adds men’s hockey and another women’s sport.
It doesn’t go by the number of sports. It’s by proportion of funding. That’s why we already have more women’s sports and why they’re now adding women’s lacrosse, too. Football takes up all the male money.
Hey, don’t blame football for sucking up all the money for male sports.   Sure, you had to pay me to play for SC, but you got your money’s worth.
Get back to worshiping me.
Most of us have things to do in our lives outside of classes.  We prioritize how to use our time.  Some people have to work.  Maybe being able to work Friday morning could land that job.  There are a multitude of other important activities in people’s lives that are worthy of their time.  Hockey may be important to you, not so much to me.  My point is that we all have choices to make re how we use our time and you wanting to play games and sleep in does not mean that you are more deserving of special treatment than anyone else on campus who may be inconvenienced by having to choose a less than ideal class time slot.
Boo hoo. You made up your mind: hockey over linguistics. And your grade suffered. What a tragedy. Had you taken more AP credits in high school, you probably could have registered earlier on your own merit. Or you could have taken some other class that didn’t meet on Fridays.
Grow up.
That makes absolutely no sense. By this writers logic all students involved in activities that require any travel or time commitments that force them to make a decision to miss class occasionally should have priority registration.
“USC clearly prioritizes academic performance. Extracurricular activities and social development follow.” This statement is nonsense, academic performance is not furthered by students that choose to play club sports getting special treatment.
I admire people that decide to put in the time to play club sports, but that does not qualify them for treatment above the rest of the student body. The rest of us make choices about what is worth our time and energy, if hockey is that important to you then play it and do your best to arrange your life around it. It is your choice to play and if that means you have to miss class you have to decide if it is worth it. I can understand not wanting to make the choice but because you want to play hockey and do well in school does not entitle you to special treatment. I am deeply involved in several academic and political causes that require that I occasionally miss class and are very time consuming. Most of these groups add far more to the campus community and reputation, yet we don’t think that it entitles us to special treatment. We’re talking about a freaking hockey team, in what world does a D2 hockey team do any GOOD.
You need to learn to make choices, you’ll be doing it for the rest of your life. How selfish/oblivious are you?
It’s unfortunate, but academics should come first if that’s the image USC is trying to promote. I’m not sure why football players get priority reg – I mean, they don’t actually care, anyway.
Adam, they get to register first because they need to have classes that can fit around their practices and what not.  If they werent able to do this the football team would have to register for classes like everyone else and that would mean there would be no open time to have practices. The amount of time and energy that these D1 athletes put in also in my mind makes them deserve this privilege

USC often gets flak for not being among the most environmentally-friendly institutions. But what people don’t seem to notice is the university’s capacity to effect environmental change in the realm students and faculty come from all over the world to benefit from in the first place — education.
Hye You| Daily Trojan
The Education and Environment Initiative, which pioneered a sustainability-minded curriculum finalized by the California Environmental Protection Agency more than a year ago, is finally picking up steam in the Golden State.
“It’s giving a new angle to material that’s already being taught in our program,” Ari Engelberg, chief executive officer of Bright Star Schools, told the Los Angeles Times. “We’re not an environmental charter, but the curriculum resonated with us because we do so much in the way of outdoor experiences for our students.”
That doesn’t sound too dissimilar to a university like USC. If the state’s cash-strapped public school system can integrate the initiative into its curriculum, why can’t we?
To be clear: I don’t mean literally use the same EEI Curriculum adopted by 100 other California schools this year — the curriculum is intended for K-12 classrooms and was clearly not designed with an institution such as USC in mind. But that doesn’t preclude the university from borrowing from the EEI’s methods of implementing its curriculum, or points from the curriculum itself.
The EEI didn’t work its way into the California school system alone; it did so in conjunction with the California Environmental Protection Agency, the State Board of Education, the California Natural Resources Agency and a host of others, including various non-governmental organizations.
Should USC elect to step up its sustainability game and move toward a greener curriculum, the first move would be reaching out to those institutions and others similarly situated to refine the new course material and help the university acclimate to it.
The EEI curriculum is even available online for free, if USC was ever struck by the urge to base an earth sciences course off a grade-school agenda, which, as anyone who has ever taken GEOL107 can attest, is not the most improbable thing. The point is, the resources are out there for USC to make its curriculum much greener than it is right now.
To be fair, the Viterbi School of Engineering does offer a masters program in green technologies, but such a course is by definition geared only toward graduate students who are probably looking to pursue a career in the field, not at the general undergraduate population.
Although no one is advocating shoving an environmental angle into every course on campus, certain areas of USC’s curriculum (read: general education) do seem primed for some EEI-like updates.
We can, as Engelberg said, graft key sustainable perspectives onto relevant course material, or even create new courses entirely.
If web registration presents us with such bizarrely-titled general education options as “Changing Family Forms,” “In a Word” and “Love, Marriage and the Experiences of Being a Wife,”  there’s probably a niche for a few sustainability-based courses, especially in the Scientific Inquiry category.
In the best case scenario, the EEI curriculum is projected to reach 6.2 million students in California, according to the Times. USC, with all its financial and creative resources, can at least reach its own 35,000.

Sounds like a great idea for a course to satisfy a science GE requirement.  The ever-evolving technology can be discussed, along with the ever-changing regulatory framework.
Maybe folks from the Stevens Institute or the Green Symposium can help out.
There are other undergraduate programs involved “green” technologies available for engineering students, including a class with professor Alice Parker in the fall. They are not just for graduates.

The Intervarsity Trojan Christian Fellowship has erected an eye-catching installation on Trousdale to address some of the problems that plague L.A.
The booth features a wheel of misfortune, photos and exhibits that touch on issues like homelessness, alcoholism, abuse, racism, poverty and injustice. One of the members is sleeping on a cardboard box in front of the spectacle to recreate the living situation of thousands of homeless people living in Los Angeles.
When someone spins their wheel of misfortune, they receive information about the topic. For example, one can receive a brief and poignant summary of racism in L.A. in about thirty seconds.
The Christian Fellowship has been participating in community service projects throughout the year, but it was after a project with a local private school in Pasadena that they say they were inspired to spread awareness of the issues in our inner cities.
“Going off of that trip we wanted to create a big spectacle on campus that really engages people about the issues of poverty, injustice, homelessness in the city,” said Katelyn Endow, a senior in interactive entertainment and one of the project coordinators for the Trojan Christian Fellowship. “We didn’t realize that a lot of these issues were relevant; but they are, and they’re hidden, and many people in L.A. are enslaved by these issues.”

After senior tailback Marc Tyler suffered a potentially spring practice-ending hamstring injury last week during practice, he attributed it to the team not stretching “like we usually do.”
At the end of last week, Kiffin denied the claims, saying the explanation itself was a stretch.
“We’ve discussed that with Marc,” Kiffin said. “Since he pulled his hamstring two hours into practice, it wasn’t the stretch before that.”
Kiffin then went on to explain that players had access to four stretching tables, something the second-year coach said, “I don’t think any college in America does.”
Tyler had attributed the lack of preparation to the earlier start time of spring ball. Kiffin and Co. have begun practices at 7:25 a.m., unlike the afternoon sessions the team was used to.
“I guess they want us to come here earlier and stretch before,” Tyler said. “I didn’t know they changed it.”
Tyler — USC’s leading rushing last season — is expected to miss the remainder of spring practice, which ends with the annual spring game on April 23.

If you haven’t heard of Shaka Smart, it’s time to wake up and partake in the Madness. The 33-year-old VCU coach, who can often be seen shuffling up and down the sidelines to energize his players, has done the unthinkable — he has led his rather unknown team from the First Four to the Final Four. 
 
After knocking off USC in a play-in game in Dayton on March 16, the Rams have gone on one of the most improbable runs in recent tournament history, capped off by Sunday’s stunning upset over top-seeded Kansas, 71-61. Along the way, VCU has defeated Georgetown, Purdue and Florida State, all teams from power conferences. 
 
The Rams have had to win five games to make it to next weekend’s semifinals, one more than the other three teams left in the field that include Kentucky, UConn and Butler.
 
When VCU was awarded with a No. 11 seed on Selection Sunday, fans and analysts were quick to express their anger. Many people strongly believed the Rams, who finished fourth in the Colonial Athletic Association standings and lost their last four regular season games, were not worthy of a bid. 
 
Needless to say, the Rams have done enough to silence most of those critics, and the selection committee members are likely breathing a sigh of relief. 
 
This is not the first time VCU has made some noise in the tournament. Four years ago, the team knocked off perennial powerhouse Duke in the first round, while boasting a No. 11 seed.
 
The Rams face off against Butler next Saturday at 3:09 p.m., ensuring that one of these mid-major teams will earn a spot in next Monday’s championship game. The winner will face the survivor of Saturday’s Kentucky vs. UConn match-up.
