Let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of J. J. Abrams —  I hope that one day I will be able to be in a room and pitch an idea to the man largely responsible for my choice to come to film school in the first place. His reboot of Star Trek hit me at a time in middle school where I was just forming a tentative idea of what I wanted to do with my life (film) and how I wanted to do it (through the space-time lens of science-fiction).  But something about my love for both the man and his company hasn’t felt right for a while now, and it’s only recently that I’ve realized what it is.
This past week, Bad Robot, the film and television production company owned by Abrams, released 10 Cloverfield Lane, starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle. At the beginning of the film, Michelle (an aspiring Midwestern fashion designer) leaves her fiancé, but as she heads out of town, she gets involved in a severe car crash that renders her unconscious. Hours later, she wakes up in an unknown bunker, and the rest of the film follows how her world has been turned upside down since the crash. The film is centered around Michelle; she’s the first and last character we see in the film, which is great. A female-driven story? Wonderful. Except it isn’t because not only was the film directed by a man, but it was also written by several male screenwriters. 
Before we go any further, I am in no way about to declare that male filmmakers cannot direct or write the female perspective. That would be propagating a type of sexism that couldn’t be further from both the truth and my beliefs. Some of my favorite female characters have come from male filmmakers (Holly Hunter’s character in James L. Brooks’ Broadcast News or Noomi Rapace in Ridley Scott’s Prometheus, for instance). Furthermore, I don’t think that there is wholly “one” female perspective that all women can relate to — as if we are all somehow connected by a biological neural network of emotions like that one Na’vi tree in Avatar. Not all women feel or act the same way, and not all men are incapable of writing female characters. 
That being said, as I watched 10 Cloverfield Lane, I couldn’t help but wonder how the film would’ve turned out had it been directed by a woman. Or, adversely, when Bad Robot decided to bring on another screenwriter (of which there were three, by the way), a woman could’ve been thrown into the mix. The truth of the matter is that most of Michelle’s actions are not only unfounded but also completely unbelievable. Her motivation seems stretched, invented and lacking all perspective. There was no relatability to her character, and no matter how many moments we were left alone with her during the film, the camera couldn’t quite capture any sense of intimacy or personal connection. 
In theory, 10 Cloverfield Lane should’ve checked all of my boxes: Produced by Abrams? Science fiction? Female-driven? Check, check and check. However, stepping out of the theater, I felt cheated; here was this story driven by a conceivably “strong woman” that failed to reach me in any way. 
This led me to take a look back on some of Abram’s past work, and I grew dismayed to discover that he hasn’t hired women in prominent positions in either writing or directing for the past several years. The last two Star Trek films were both written and directed by men, and the upcoming film Star Trek Beyond is also directed and written by another set of men. Even Abram’s 2010 foray into the romantic comedy genre Morning Glory starring Rachel McAdams as an ambitious, young news producer looking to carve her way into New York City’s television market place, was directed by a man, but written by a woman. 
The reality of this is unacceptable, because even though Abrams has been heralded as a champion of diversity for hiring both a woman and a black man as the two leads of the latest Star Wars reboot, he doesn’t seem to extend that policy beyond his on-camera talent. Of course, there is the saying that you should hire “the best person for the job,” rather than apply a type of affirmative action only meant to reach a quota. But I feel wholeheartedly that Dan Trachtenberg (who had only directed commercials and short films prior to coming onboard 10 Cloverfield Lane) was absolutely ill-equipped and in no way ready to spearhead that film. So why choose him when I know a dozen other female directors who were probably more than ready to direct a tent-pole sci-fi film?
In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter this past week, Abrams admitted that the #OscarsSoWhite campaign was a “wakeup call” in terms of hiring diversity below and above the line. He stated that Bad Robot is now encouraging agencies to submit a plethora of new voices and perspectives to the pool of creators already being considered for future projects. But frankly, asking agencies to submit atypical clients does nothing but attempt to mask his historically prejudiced system. Sure, asking for different voices could be considered a good first step, but it’ll take actual action to convince me that I might possibly be able to be in a room pitching to him one day after all. For now, I’m disappointed and disillusioned, waiting for the day that “diversity” is no longer a talking point because the right human is finally hired for the job — regardless of race or gender — not just the right man.

Viet Thanh Nguyen, an associate professor of English and American studies and ethnicity, was nominated earlier this month as one of five finalists for the 2016 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction for his debut novel, The Sympathizer.
According to the press release of the PEN/Faulkner Award, nearly 500 novels and short story collections written by American authors published in the United States in the 2015 calendar year have been reviewed by a panel of judges. The five finalists include Nguyen, Elizabeth Tallent, James Hannaham, Julie Iromuanya and Luis Alberto Urrea. The final winner will be announced on April 5.
The Sympathizer is a novel narrated by a half-French, half-Vietnamese communist spy in the South Vietnamese army, who eventually flees to the United States before the fall of Saigon. He is forced to confront the limitations of his beliefs upon his arrival.
“I really wanted to use that type of a narrator and that type of a setup — someone who feels that he is caught between different worlds and between different ideologies,” Nguyen said.
His personal background shaped his literary focus. He and his family came to the United States in 1975 as refugees because of the Vietnam War.
“Our family was separated from each other, sent to different sponsors. So at 4 years old, I was sent to live with a white family by myself,” Nguyen said. “That was the beginning of the consciousness and memory for me and that always imprinted itself on me.”
According to Nguyen, he initially wrote the book for himself because he wanted to have a say in the world. To him, books and movies about the Vietnam War lacked the element he looked for.
“There was a significant absence of something I wanted to say that hadn’t been said before. So, therefore, I was writing for myself,” Nguyen said. “But I also have to believe that, in doing that, I would find some like-minded readers who are also like me. That was an act of faith to try to reach out to those people, too.”
After his successful debut, he started working on his second book, Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War, which will be officially released in April.
“This is fictional and scholarly bookends of a project about how we remember war and how we confront our own inhumanity,” Nguyen said. “The concerns I had as an undergraduate and a graduate student, thinking both about literature and culture on one end and ethnic studies or race on the other, have motivated me for most of my professional career.”
Nguyen also talked about the importance of the class he teaches. He has taught “American Studies 150: The American War in Vietnam” five times to classes of 150 to 200 students.
“I was able to write that book as a story because I was trying to tell my students a story about what the Vietnam War means and the challenges of memory,” Nguyen said. “It was really important to me as a teacher to incorporate what I was thinking about as a scholar and as a writer into my class. Teaching that class was really important to me to write these two books.”
Nguyen expressed his emotions after achieving the accomplishments with his debut novel.
“The book has been reviewed almost completely positively in the press, and that is gratifying, of course,” Nguyen said. “But I am someone who spent many years working as a critic and as a writer, and I tend to take all of that with a big grain of salt. It is great to get all the accolades and prizes, but all of that is less important than the act of writing itself.”
He shared how he currently feels about being nominated along with other writers.
“One of interesting facts for being nominated for prizes is just recognizing how talented other writers are — their accomplishments, the books and how powerful their works are,” Nguyen said. “To be in the company of these other writers in the PEN/Faulkner is really an honor because many of them have significant track records and publications I don’t have.”

Thad Scherer is finally getting his big break. The freshman was one of twelve USC students who competed in USC College Star, a collegiate singing competition modeled after American Idol, on Thursday at the Belasco Theater.
Scherer, who is majoring in theatre, has won $1,000 and will now have the opportunity to produce and record his own single with Grammy-winning producers.
USC College Star started out with Brent Freed’s vision to bring the competition to USC’s campus. A junior at UC Berkeley and the founder and CEO of the organization, Freed successfully launched the show at his own school before deciding to give it a shot at USC.
“I wanted to create a unique platform for college students to showcase their talent and meet other talented students,” Freed said. “Our goal is to have contestants leave our show inspired to pursue their music and also use it to do good in the world.”
Anyone who wished to participate was welcome to submit an audition video through College Star’s online channel. From there, 24 applicants were selected to participate in a “Boot Camp” Weekend, and 12 of them advanced to the final round at the Belasco.
Each student performed a song of their choice and was evaluated by a panel of four judges. The winner was determined by the judges’ scores, combined with votes from the live audience.
Scherer chose to sing a mash-up of “S&M” by Rihanna and “Earned It” by The Weeknd. After all the scores and votes were calculated, Scherer was announced the official winner of USC College Star 2016.
“Winning College Star felt like a dream,” Scherer said. “I imagined every great moment I’ve had at USC … and all those moments combined might have gotten close to how special it felt to perform on stage.”
Freed explained that he created the live show aspect of College Star specifically to give contestants a greater stage and more performance experience.
“Not every college student is pursuing a music major,” Freed said. “I wanted to give anyone who is passionate about music — engineers, philosophers, a cappella singers — the chance to perform in front of hundreds of people, meet industry experts and simply grow as an artist.”
This year, the live show was hosted by Grant Genske, the winner of College Star UC Berkeley 2014. Having won the competition previously, Genske found it very rewarding to be on the other side this time and help students showcase their talents.
“It was a total pleasure to host College Star and work with these 12 wonderful students,” Genske said. “Our judges were insightful and fun, the top 12 students were flawless in their performances, and the crowd was lively and engaged — that’s everything we can hope for in this show.”
The only one to combine two songs in his performance, Scherer is grateful he had this opportunity to showcase his own arrangement.
“It is so unique to find a university that fosters so much passion,” Scherer said. “Whether it be electrical engineering or music, you can tell how much dedication and love people put into the things they are doing here, and I could really see that in each and every performance during the finals.”

The Los Angeles City Council voted on March 15 to approve the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s request for an increase in electricity rates for residents, as well as higher water costs and stiffer penalties for heavy users.
The vote comes after months of lobbying from the LADWP, which argued that these rate hikes to consumers would help to reduce overall power use while also providing additional funds for needed improvements to infrastructure. LADWP claim that these benefits, which include enhancements to reliability and making sustainable energy sources a larger portion of the power grid, far outweigh direct costs that residents will incur.
According to the LADWP, these rate increases will take place gradually over the next five years, with the average consumer experiencing a 3.86 percent increase in their monthly bills each year. Depending on one’s electricity needs, at the end of five years, rates are expected to go up between $4.20 per month for low-use residents and $16.31 per month for higher-use residents, or between $50.40 and $316.80 per year.
State mandates require Los Angeles to transition to renewable sources for 33 percent of its energy use, and approximately 80 percent of the additional revenue generated from the rate hikes is currently budgeted to meet this goal. The rest will go toward updating the grid infrastructure and paying labor costs.
Student reactions to these rate increases are mixed, with some students saying that the improvements to efficiency and reliability are worth the larger bill.
“I don’t really care about the additional cost because it’s spread out over a year, and it’s not that high,” said Yi Zheng, a masters student in electrical engineering. “Personally, it’s not that bad for me, and lots of apartments have the electricity built into rent anyway.”
However, Zheng also conceded that he might think twice about running the air conditioning in the summer if he were on a tighter budget. Despite this reasoning, other students thought that the rate increases are difficult to justify.
“I feel like the government should eat those costs and not consumers, since it’s their responsibility to make the city green in the first place,” said Tiara Conley, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “We already pay too much in taxes, and the cost of living is high enough.”

CubeForme, a startup formed by Kyle Pham, a sophomore double majoring in cognitive science and philosophy, politics and law, and Nick Nguyen, a UC Irvine student, was featured in Inc. Magazine’s “16 Coolest College Startups of 2016” this March. The magazine pitted startups against each other in a tournament, and CubeForme has made it to the second round of competition.
Pham and Nguyen created their startup with about $2000 in funding last fall. It sells a monthly subscription box filled with “3D-printed creations,” and Pham said the purpose is to connect designers with audiences.
“Each month, we feature a different designer, and we use their work to curate a themed box. Our angle is sort of pushing an appreciation of 3D printing and its creative possibilities,” Pham said.
Though Pham and Nguyen’s academic backgrounds may not appear directly connected to 3D printing, Pham said the duo was drawn to entrepreneurship from the start.
“Both of us have always had a desire to create a venture,” Pham said. “I think it really started later on in high school, where we kind of had joking discussions. But as college started, we realized there are all these resources available to us, and there was that real sense of a startup culture.”
Though CubeForme has sold only about 60 boxes since its inception, Pham is grateful for the gradual growth — especially since the company’s 3D printer is housed outside co-founder Nguyen’s bedroom.
“[It’s] is a very small number,” Pham said. “Ultimately, we’re looking to grow a lot by focusing on branding, collaborations and hosting giveaways, just getting the product out there first. But I almost appreciate that it’s been gradual so far because it’s made it much easier to balance with the rest of my life.”
Pham said the idea of subscription-based 3D-printed art arose from a desire to “impact 3D printing as an industry.” CubeForme has sought out popular designers online to create the products that go into each box.
“It differs each month. Artistic objects are one kind of thing you can receive, but other months it might be more gadget-based. Other times it’s more interactive, kind of toy-based,” Pham said.
After a failed Kickstarter fund last fall, CubeForme found success after entering Inc. Magazine’s contest this spring. Criteria for the contest included concept originality, each entry’s pitch and growth potential.

The women’s lacrosse team improved to 9-0 on the season after routing Oregon 17-4 at McAlister Field on Sunday.
The Ducks threatened the Women of Troy early on, jumping out to an early 2-1 lead. Oregon’s attack looked menacing, as freshman attacker Shannon Williams opened the scoring just over two minutes into the game. Williams and her fellow attackers showed promising signs in the first few minutes, starting off with a strong pace.
However, USC’s offense started clicking, as the Women of Troy turned a 2-1 deficit into a 7-2 lead over the course of just 20 minutes. USC head coach Lindsey Munday attributed the turnaround to discipline by her group, particularly at the defensive end.
“Oregon had some long possessions early on in the game, and we didn’t change anything that we’ve been doing for the entire season,” Munday said.
Munday praised her team for being patient and warding off the early danger with composure. The team stayed patient and then attacked. While Munday felt the chemistry between all seven attackers was a strong factor, she also noted how crucial sophomore goalie Gussie Johns’ performance was.
Johns stood tall between the pipes and made some fine saves.
“Just the improvement that we’ve seen in Gussie has been phenomenal,” Munday said.
She explained that the sophomore has not only been stopping shots but also leading the defense.
“[Johns is] just a tremendous leader,” Munday said. “She’s a really hard worker, and she’s never satisfied with where she’s at — she wants to continue to get better.”
Johns made seven saves on the afternoon and continued to frustrate the visitors. But despite the lopsided score line, Oregon challenged Johns and the USC defense.
“I think Oregon came in really prepared for this game,” Johns said. “They did a great job of making a game plan against us.”
But USC’s dominant win can be attributed to something simple in theory but potentially tricky in reality: The group stuck to the game plan.
“We try to just think about ourselves every single time,” Johns said.
She added that this defensive unit sticks to its keys on and works well as a unit.
With stifling defense, USC limited Oregon to meager offensive output. This has been a storyline all season for the Women of Troy, who have allowed just 13 goals in the last four games.
While junior attacker Michaela Michael and senior attacker Caroline deLyra combined for 12 goals in the rout over Oregon, there is more to this team than a versatile offense. Likewise, this team is more than a defensive machine.
In addition to success on the field, the team tries to enjoy the time they spend together off the field.
“We make everything fun before games, not to take things too seriously,” deLyra said.
DeLyra is visibly locked in when she is playing, but she feels the team’s jovial mood is a real asset on game day. Whether they are dancing during warm-ups or breaking down opposing defenses, the Women of Troy clearly have excellent camaraderie and it shows when they dominate teams on a regular basis.
The team visits Fresno State on Thursday at 5 p.m.

Fresh off a series win against Cal and an early-week victory against Cal State Fullerton, baseball rode a three-game winning streak into its series against No. 17 UC Santa Barbara on Saturday.
After dropping the first two contests at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium, the Trojans returned to Los Angeles on Saturday trying to avoid a sweep in the series finale. They defeated UCSB 9-5.
Redshirt junior Joe Navilhon was sharp in his second start of the season. The righty gave up 2 runs in his first three innings of work but then settled down, shutting out the Gauchos across the next three frames. He exited after the longest start of his career with one out in the seventh and a 9-2 lead. Junior Jeff Paschke entered in relief and gave up a 2-run triple, completing Navilhon’s line.
“Joe picked us up today,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “He minimized [the damage]. He didn’t let innings be big innings. Everything was small.”
Navilhon is still in the process of adjusting to his new role in the rotation after spending the early years of his Trojan career in the bullpen, but he was comfortable starting on the mound on Saturday.
“I felt pretty strong as the game went along,” Navilhon said. “I wish I could have finished that seventh inning, but I knew my teammates were going to come in and get the job done if I didn’t.”
Senior center fielder Timmy Robinson led the way for the Trojan bats, belting 2 long homers and driving in 5. The first four hitters in the USC lineup accounted for all of the RBIs, as senior AJ Ramirez, redshirt junior David Edson and junior Jeremy Martinez combined to drive in the remaining 4 runs in the Trojans’ victory.
“Everybody did their part,” Robinson said. “It was a great team win. We had people consistently getting on base, which is what makes for all those RBIs.”
Hubbs agreed with his slugger.
“Up and down the lineup, we had good at-bats,” Hubbs said.
The win brought USC back to .500 at 11-11 on the season and it salvaged a tough three-game set, which had not gotten off to a good start in Santa Barbara. The Trojans fell 10-1 on Thursday, as senior Brent Wheatley took the ball for the series opener.
The veteran right-hander struggled, scattering eight hits and three walks across five innings of work and giving up 5 runs (4 earned).  Sophomore Mason Perryman and redshirt freshman Bryce Dyrda came on in relief combining to also give up 5 runs in two innings. USC’s bats were kept silent all night, as sophomore Shane Bieber worked seven strong innings for the Gauchos, giving up just one run en route to a comfortable fourth win of the season.
Sophomore Brad Wegman toed the rubber on Friday, and the offense staked him an early lead with runs in the first and third innings. Wegman began to labor in the fourth, however, and departed with one out in the fifth inning after giving up 3 runs — 4 earned, the last on another costly USC error. The Trojans were blanked across the remaining frames, losing the game, 5-2, and the series.
“[UCSB] did a really good job over the first two days,” Hubbs said. “They played good defense, they didn’t give us any free passes and they kept the ball down.”
Hubbs said the team is at its best when players don’t try to do too much, but he admitted they had begun to press in Santa Barbara.
“We got a little bit frustrated during the first two days because they pounded the zone below the knees, and we gave them too much,” he said. “[On Friday], we only gave up three hits, but then we gave them 5 runs.”
Hubbs and company will hope that Saturday’s positives are a springboard into the upcoming grind of conference play.
“We still have a lot of season left,” Robinson said. “Hopefully we can carry on.”
Next up for USC is Loyola Marymount, as the Lions visit Dedeaux Field on Tuesday night.  The two sides met at LMU in February, with the Trojans taking a close 4-3 victory.  USC will then head north for a series on the road against Stanford.

As it seems to every year, March Madness took the absurdity to an even higher level. Last year’s first weekend of hard-fought battles and buzzer-beaters was trumped by double-digit comebacks in less than 60 seconds and tip-ins and bank shots galore. USC had the privilege of joining in on the madness this season, facing off against Providence in a closely contested game that the Trojans unfortunately lost at the buzzer.
USC had countless opportunities to put the game away, but its youth and inexperience took over and cost them a matchup with the North Carolina Tar Heels in the second round. That’s the beauty and agony of March, all rolled into one game. USC’s season seemingly ended at least one game prematurely, but hopefully it gives them the drive to make the necessary improvements in the offseason that will propel them beyond the first round next year.
The Trojan team surprised everyone this season by even making it into the tournament, showing up a few years ahead of schedule. They were young and fast and flashed glimpses of immense potential throughout the season. Unfortunately, those glimpses were far too infrequent against Providence.
However, if the rest of March has demonstrated anything, it is that the way to build a contender in college basketball is not through the one-and-done process. Unless your coach is named Krzyzewski or Calipari, your program is generally better off avoiding these short-lived prospects and developing highly talented recruits into multi-year contributors.
That seems to be the model that USC is working on, even in the face of a few transfers that might hurt depth, and it’s the best way to build a perennial contender. One only has to look across town to see the detrimental effects of building a program around highly touted, but transient, recruits.
UCLA has lost two talented freshmen to the draft the last two years, leaving their current talent base diminished and overly reliant on Bryce Alford. While they were able to recruit other elite prospects, like Jonah Bolden, for the most part their hopes were pinned on Zach LaVine and Kevon Looney.
In contrast, USC has retained all of its significant talent, developing players like junior guard Julian Jacobs and sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin into stalwarts, who both still have eligibility left to further contribute to the Trojan program. Now, if freshman forwards Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu both return for their sophomore years — which would be the prudent decision to make — they will be able to further bolster their skill sets as well.
This is the model for a successful program. Oklahoma, Villanova, North Carolina, and Virginia are all well-coached teams that have a strong depth chart and veteran leadership. That is what USC should aspire to be like. They are well on their way, and with another talented recruiting class coming in, head coach Andy Enfield can solidify the system and help USC leap to the elite tier of the Pac-12.
The Trojans need to smooth out their rough edges. They need to improve on defense, particularly in the interior. A full offseason regimen of training and eating at the college level will surely help Metu pack on the requisite weight necessary to be a dominant anchor for an entire season. Working on flexibility and leg strength will help Boatwright be more physical on the low block, complementing his excellent perimeter game and sending his draft stock soaring even higher.
The Trojans will be aided by the addition of two talented guards in De’Anthony Melton and Jonah Mathews, in addition to the transfer of former Louisville guard Shaqquan Aaron. The perimeter will continue to be a source of strength for USC, with these additions and the return of most of their core intact.
It is the paint where experience and improvement will help the Trojans the most. The Trojans are buoyed by the commitment of 6-foot-10 forward Harrison Henderson, but he is still very thin and needs to bulk up to make a season-long impact in the Pac-12. The hopes of a vastly improved 2016-2017 basketball program will rest on the shoulders of the returning post players.
That is how programs like Oklahoma and Villanova have steadily improved each year, and hopefully the Trojans can follow suit. They have the facilities, the resources and now finally, the players to make it happen. This March was insane, but next year’s will be even wilder if the Trojans have the interior presence to make it into April.

The top-ranked women’s water polo team hit the road over the weekend to face off against No. 10 San Jose State for their second MPSF game. The Trojans came out on top and still perfect, beating the Spartans 11-6 and taking their overall record to 15-0 and 2-0 in MPSF.
The Trojans took offensive command throughout the entire game. Despite a slowdown in the offense in the second quarter, junior 2-meter Avery Peterson and the Trojans increased the tempo for the second half to hammer home a solid victory, with Peterson scoring a hat trick.
In the first quarter, USC fired away goals against SJSU, with a skip shot from junior driver Nikki Stansfield to kick off the scoring frenzy for the Trojans. Next up, junior 2-meter powerhouse Brigitta Games found the back of the net followed by another goal from senior driver Melissa Bergesen to put the Trojans up 3-0.
The defense kept the Spartans silent for the first few minutes of play and it was solid all game long, holding MPSF top scorer Rae Lekness from the Spartans to just one goal. However, the Spartans answered with a goal from Carla Toha-Vilanova. The Trojans quickly bounced back with another 2 goals from Games and junior driver Ioanna Haralabidis to end the first quarter 5-1.
In the second frame, the Trojan offense was unable to convert any goals against Spartans’ goalie Alicia Magliocco, who totaled 11 saves for the entire game. The Spartans were able to knock in a goal to lessen the deficit to 3 goals by the half.
By the third quarter, Lekness, the conference’s leading scorer broke her silence to convert a goal and bring the score to 5-3. The Trojan offense bounced back, led by Peterson, who tallied up 2 back-to-back goals to increase the lead 7-3. Sophomore Annika Jensen also converted one for the Trojans to maintain an 8-4 lead by the end of the third frame.
The final frame would solidify a great win for the Trojans with a power 2-meter goal from Peterson, her third of the evening. Next, the Haralabidis sisters, Stephania and Ioanna, each added a goal to their name to bring the lead to 11-4. The Spartans squirreled away 2 more goals before the end of the period to make the final score 11-6 but proved unsuccessful in toppling the No. 1 Trojans.
USC will hit the road once again this Saturday to face off in a non-conference game against San Diego State. The Trojans will then return home Sunday to host CSU Bakersfield in their third conference match of the season at 1 p.m. at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

One year after finishing fourth overall at the NCAA Championships, the USC men’s swimming and diving team had a slightly more difficult time putting together the kind of team effort it would have taken to top last year’s performance. After only dropping one head-to-head meet during the regular season and finishing second in the Pac-12 Championships, the Trojans finished 13th overall at the NCAA Championships in Atlanta, Georgia.
Texas, the winner of last year’s national championship, repeated this year with a dominant collective effort. Led by junior Will Licon and sophomore Joseph Schooling, who each set NCAA records in their respective events, the Longhorns never trailed on their way to the national title. With their win in this year’s championships, Texas ties Michigan for the most all-time men’s swimming titles with 12.
At 13th overall, the Trojans were the second-highest finisher of all Pac-12 competitors. Cal, last year’s Pac-12 champions, finished second overall at the meet with 351 points. USC edged out Stanford — this year’s conference champion — by 4.5 points; the Trojans scored 117 to the Cardinal’s 112.5.
The Trojans began the tournament on Wednesday with a ninth-place finish in the 800-yard freestyle relay to match their ninth overall ranking in the nation. Freshman Patrick Mulcare, junior Michael Domagala, senior Morten Klarskov and junior Reed Malone turned in solid times in their individual legs, but collectively they were not quick enough to repeat their title-winning performance from last year.
On Thursday, the Trojans saw strong efforts from Malone and their two star divers, seniors Collin Pollard and Deon Reid. Malone placed third in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:12.55; Malone also reached the podium at the 2015 championships with another third-place finish.
Pollard, last year’s Pac-12 swimmer of the month, was an NCAA “A” Finalist for the first time this season with a seventh-place finish on the 1-meter. Last year, Pollard scored twice to become a “B” Finalist for the first time, but his score this year was good enough to make him a first-time All-American, a fitting finish to his stellar collegiate career. Reid finished ninth on the 1-meter for his first-ever “B” Final.
“I am so pleased with the first diving event [Thursday],” diving coach Hongping Li said. “Collin and Deon really opened it with a super performance. The key success for both divers was to dive with fun and to meet a personal target score, which they did.”
Malone continued his strong showing on Friday, finishing 5th overall in the 200-yard freestyle. His time of 1:32.54 is USC’s second-best time in the event in school history, and his new personal best time in the event. Sophomore Ralf Tribuntsov also placed fifth in his event, the 100-yard backstroke, after finishing 8th last year as a freshman. Mulcare also scored points for the Trojans on Friday, finishing seventh in the “B” Final in the 100-yard backstroke.
Several USC swimmers scored on Saturday, the final day of the meet. Sophomore Pawel Furtek was the first swimmer to contribute with a personal-best time in the mile, good enough for 10th overall. Mulcare, swimming in his first NCAA “A” Final, finished 8th in the 200-yard backstroke, an event he has dominated all season. Tribuntsov scored again with a 15th overall finish in the 100-yard freestyle.
Two Trojans scored in the 200-yard breaststroke: junior Steven Stumph, who has won the past two conference titles in the event, won the “B” Final with a ninth place overall finish, and freshman Carsten Vissering scored his first-ever NCAA points with a 16th overall finish in the event. Tribuntsov, Mulcare, junior David Morgan Jr. and Malone placed seventh in the “B” Final of the 400-yard freestyle relay to close out the meet for the Trojans.
Despite not matching last year’s top-four finish, the future looks bright for USC. All of this year’s scoring swimmers, with the exception of Klarskov, will be returning next season, and the young core of talent now has one additional postseason under their belts. The diving team will have a difficult time replacing Pollard and Reid, but whoever steps in to replace those divers will look up to rising junior Dashiell Enos and the rest of the veteran squad.
The Men swimming program goes nowhere. Finish 4th in 2015 then regress to 13th the next year. No National Title since the
Mid- Seventies is ridiculous while Texas wins back to back. A new modern luxurious swim stadium, and you can’t recruit the top tier swimmers. Maybe too much concentration on foreign athletes for the squad. Good time to find a separate coach for the team when seasons are combined for both men and women programs. Salo has been in charge for many years now with minor big time results. Always looking ahead to the next year while the better programs elsewhere produce now. Trojan major spring sports except for women golf, maybe water polo and sand volleyball which the vast majority don’t participate are spinning their wheels from year to year.

Indie-electronic band, The Naked and Famous, made the world fall in love with their sound in 2010 when the group released its debut album Passive Me, Aggressive You. After making their first appearance of 2016 at the Auckland City Limits in New Zealand in mid-March, the band will head back to the studio to finish writing and recording their third record. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles-based New Zealanders will play intimate shows in Boston, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco and Toronto. The band made their return to Los Angeles with a sold-out show Friday night at the Troubadour in West Hollywood.
The five-piece Australian alternative rock band The Rubens opened the show, performing six songs to the full crowd. Their soulful and melodic rock sound soon became an instant favorite among the attendees. Five of the songs the band performed came from their first EP My Gun, with the other being “Hoops,” one of thier most popular singes. After The Rubens finished their set, The Naked and Famous took the stage, opening with a few songs from their latest album, In Rolling Waves.
An echoed synth-chord filled the darkness of the club followed by a strumming from Thom Powers’ acoustic guitar on “A Stillness,” the opening track from In Rolling Waves. Lead vocalist Alisa Xayalith was wearing all black and rocked a dark pixie haircut. She said the band was genuinely thrilled to be playing at such a historically rich place as The Troubadour. She also highly encouraged fans to jump and dance around. Less than 10 seconds into the hit  “Punching in a Dream,” the audience grew exhilarated as the blitz of synth-pop melodies reached their bodies. At one point the audience overtook Xayalith’s vocals, singing louder and louder to the chorus of “whoas.” The energy at the venue and the band’s enormous stage presence was incredibly electric, the pit resembled an intimate rave party.
Power took the lead on “Girls Like You.” He drenched the venue with a summer-like vibe,  getting the entire crowd clapping, jumping and singing along. The band also provided a balance between electronic-infused beats and traditional indie-rock, continuing straight into “Rolling Waves,” the band’s most rock-oriented song. Things then slowed down with “Hearts Like Ours” and “Grow Old.” The room lit up with purple lights giving Powers the spotlight as he sang gently. The Naked and Famous then entreated fans with “Higher,” a performance which kept the crowd bobbing their heads up and down to the group’s latest single. It seemed like The Naked and Famous’ fascination with synthpop continues.
The band touched a nerve of nostalgia as they began to wrap up with the track everyone had been waiting to hear — “Young Blood.” The massive hit played on the radio countless times in 2011, serving as a summer anthem for many. Xayalith reached out and touched the hands of fans in the front row as the sparkling boom of synth filled the room. She once again encouraged the crowd to join her and sing out the song’s “yeah yeah yeah” chorus. Shortly after, the band bid their farewell, transforming the entire club into a giant mosh pit accompanied with high energy and  mindless dancing.
The Naked and Famous will head to Toronto Friday, after their two-night mainstay at the Teragram Ballroom and the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

Lights. Camera. Party rock. Redfoo, half of the former musical duo LMFAO with his nephew Sky Blu, released his first solo album, Party Rock Mansion, March 18 and performed at the Roxy Theatre Friday. The 13 featured songs provided fans with a revival of LMFAO’s upbeat and electronic sound, but with Redfoo’s personal twist. Redfoo and his bandmates will be touring until early August, with Sapporo, Japan, as their next stop in the international leg of the tour.
The venue filled up with party animals of all ages as opening acts DJ Shufflebot and Q the Hype Man pumped up the crowd with radio hits, glow sticks and inflatable giraffes and zebras. In matching “I Am A Booty Man” tank tops, DJ Shuttlebot worked the music while Q ran the show and interacted well with the audience.
Next was DJ Dainjazone, who kept the crowd going with popular tunes like “Hotline Bling” and “Lean On,” showing the audience familiar sounds before they were exposed to Redfoo’s new tracks.
Finally, Redfoo’s bandmates, in their matching, colorful leopard print clothing, introduced their new leader. The all-too recognizable afro and colorfully rimmed glasses had returned on stage. The opening song, “Keep Shining,” energized the crowd with the same spark LMFAO once had. Although he has moved on from the dynamic duo, Redfoo acknowledged his wild beginnings with throwback songs such as “Shots” and “Party Rock Anthem.” After a blast from the past, Redfoo toasted his new party rock anthems from the album by showering his fans with bottles of Martinelli’s sparkling cider.
In a different manner, Redfoo showed his fans that he could deviate from his old party rocking ways by moving the concert into a more soulful direction. Before performing “Meet Her At Tomorrow,” he explained that it was written about an ex-girlfriend, letting his dark, mystifying voice take hold of the microphone. Features on the new album such as Stevie Wonder in “Where the Sun Goes” adds a new element of expressiveness the artist was not previously known for.
However, Redfoo’s last song of the concert, “Booty Man,” electrified the venue with the band’s matching denim vests that lit up in the midst of the smoky effects. The dancers pulled plenty of girls up onto the stage and Redfoo assembled them into a party train, as one of the tracks on the new album is titled. With a great show in the books, Redfoo managed to leave the audience with a revitalized sense of exhilaration that LMFAO once brought to their fans.

On Saturday night, men’s volleyball ended its road trip with a visit up Highway 1 to Pepperdine. In their first match of the year in late January, the Trojans upset the No. 8 Waves at the Galen Center 3-2. Two months later, they were looking for similar magic on the road to keep their postseason hopes alive.
The now-No. 6 Waves fought off the Trojan onslaught to win in straight sets (31-29, 25-22, 25-23) and tie the season series at one apiece.  The Waves improved to 12-7 overall and 11-7 in the MPSF and secured a MPSF Tourney bid over the weekend.  They currently sit in fifth place in the MPSF, three games behind No. 4 Long Beach State and one ahead of No. 7 UC Santa Barbara.
On Saturday, Pepperdine was playing to secure that fifth seed in the MPSF while 10th-place USC (4-14, 6-16 MPSF) was fighting toward that elusive eighth seed.  Hence, both teams played all-in from the first point.
The first set was gut-wrenching through all 62 points. USC took its largest lead at 21-17, and Pepperdine took its only 2-point lead to win 31-29. There were eight lead changes and 26 ties. Pepperdine took the set by winning 3 points in a row off USC errors — the only 3-point run in the game.
Errors continued to be a problem for the Trojans. They suffered 18 errors from the service line and nailed only two aces. Their attacking came together nicely, though. As a team, they hit .356. Junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder hit .500 with 19 kills. Senior middle blocker Tommy Leonard, who did not play in Thursday’s match at Stanford, hit .714 with 5 kills plus an ace and a block.
Pepperdine was sharp offensively, too. The Waves hit .381 and served five aces. Redshirt senior opposite Matt Tarantino hit .462 with 15 kills and 3 aces. The Waves only tallied four blocks as redshirt senior middle blocker Tommy Carmody had a quiet night, but USC only tallied 6.5.
After USC fell behind 14-9, head coach Jeff Nygaard took a timeout, and whatever he said worked. The Trojans 9-5 run after the timeout brought their deficit to just one point. However, a service error by senior middle blocker Tommy Leonard backed up by an ace from Pepperdine’s Matt Tarantino put the set out of USC’s reach.
In set three, the two teams came out nose-to-nose once again. Finally, USC broke the game open with a 3-0 run to take an 18-14 lead. They traded points with the Waves until they had a 23-20 lead, and the set looked to be theirs. However, Pepperdine ended the match on a 5-0 run which included two Tarantino kills and three USC attack errors.
It was an abrupt end to an intense match that went the way of the favorites. In the box score, this one will go down as a three-setter with no big surprises, but the match felt a lot closer.
USC has four matches left this season. Next up, their final two home games will be against UC San Diego on April 2 and UC Irvine on April 3.

Editor’s Note: This letter to the editor is printed in response to the column “David Horowitz does not belong on campus,” which ran in the March 23, 2016 edition of the Daily Trojan. This letter has been printed as submitted and the information presented has not been independently verified.
On the day I was scheduled to speak at USC this week, a column appeared in the Daily Trojan, titled “David Horowitz Does Not Belong On Campus.” The author, an Iranian student named Lida Dianti, justified her desire to ban me from speaking by claiming that I was a racist and anti-Muslim, and that I “vilified Palestinians.”
In fact, I have been a lifelong defender of minorities and particularly African Americans, having been in my first civil rights march 68 years ago, during the Truman administration, almost half a century before Lida Dianti was born. Dianti justifies her claim that I am an anti-black racist with these words: “He has refuted the prevalence of institutionalized racism,” and “[dismissed] the systems that actively oppress black Americans.” Well, if I’ve “refuted” the claim that there is institutional racism then what is the complaint? Apparently, the complaint is that the truth is racist. This actually captures my view of the protests against conservative speakers on this and other campuses: The protesters can’t handle the truth.
I do believe that institutionalized racism is a myth. Despite protests at the University of Missouri and Yale about “racism,” for example, these institutions spend millions of dollars to recruit minority students and rig admissions requirements to benefit those that can’t meet their standards. Those are facts, not opinions, which leftists can’t refute and therefore want to suppress.
The claim that I am anti-Muslim was lifted by Dianti from a left-wing smear site where I am described as “the godfather of the anti-Muslim movement.” Despite the fact that I have written more than a million published words and there are hours of video recordings of my campus speeches and TV appearances on YouTube, neither the left-wing smear site nor Lida Dianti were able to find even one sentence that could honestly be described as “anti-Muslim.” I am not against Muslims. I am against Islamic terror and the Islamic jihad. My detractors convert this into an attack on all Muslims by ignoring that crucial distinction.
I have never described Muslim students as “Wahhabi Islamicists who basically support our enemies,” as Dianti falsely claims. I have said that specific organizations, like Students for Justice in Palestine, were created by the Muslim Brotherhood and support the Hamas terrorists who are our enemies. Students for Justice in Palestine and the Muslim Students Association, which is also a creature of the Muslim Brotherhood, have conducted national campaigns to demonize Israel and its Jews, and support the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions movement whose goal is to strangle the Jewish state — which is the real reason why I am regularly attacked by the left on campuses like this.
Finally, in a speech at Brooklyn College, I did say that the Palestinians are “morally sick” — one of the few statements in Dianti’s column that is true — but she left out the context. I had first pointed out that Hamas and the Palestinian leadership explicitly call for the extermination of the Jews. I described this as “Nazi.” I pointed out that 100 percent of Palestinians who vote, vote for terrorist parties with these Nazi agendas. I said leftists will nonetheless defend the support of Nazi agendas as the regrettable effect of being oppressed. Then I said this: “But even if they were oppressed, that is no excuse for embracing Nazism. People have been oppressed for thousands of years, yet there has never before been a people that has strapped bombs to its own children, told them to blow themselves up along with other children who are Jews, and if they do so they will go to heaven.  Moreover, if they are lucky enough to be male, they will be rewarded with 72 virgins. That is sick.” You may disagree with my conclusion but it is hardly an attack on Palestinians as such. It is an attack on their behavior.
Lida Dianti concludes her plea that I should be silenced by saying that hers “is not an attack on freedom of speech but rather on hate speech.” This is a very dangerous misunderstanding of freedom of speech, which either protects all speech or is meaningless. One woman’s hate speech is another man’s truth. Learn to live with that, Lida, and since you are a college student, learn to deal with arguments you don’t like by finding ways to refute them, rather than by conducting protests to suppress them.
David Horowitz
Author
I hope all USC undergraduates realize that even hate speech is protected under the 1st Amendment; just ask any USC Law School professor.
I don’t think anyone denies that he has a constitutional right, no? The question is whether someone of his sort should be invited to speak on campus.
What is your argument against inviting him on to campus?  That he isn’t intellectual enough for your tastes?  Like him or not, David Horowitz has written a couple dozen books, is a media celebrity, and is someone whose opinions are taken seriously by a significant segment of the American population.  Why is he any less desirable a speaker than a wealthy dilettante like Arianna Huffington, who is scheduled to speak April 13?
Huffington created a media empire. Can you think of anyone better to speak to Annenberg students, for example? Horowitz isn’t an academic, doesn’t have particularly interesting or thoughtful views, speaks in an uncivil and hostile language designed to annoy, provoke, and divide, and is a pretty marginal figure. Why not have a Salaam, a Yuri Levin, a Ponnuru, a Walter Russell Mead?
Huffington cashed in on her divorce to a very wealthy guy to “build” her “empire.” If the advice she gives in her lecture is how to marry rich with no prenup then exploit dimwit celebrities’ need for validation as serious thinkers by convincing them to blog for free, then I guess she will be working in her area of expertise. She’s a Donald Trump who married into wealth rather than being born into it.
Yes, married to a late Republican Senator from PA. Nonetheless, HuffPo is huuuuuge. She may have had the money to invest, but it would be very hard-hearted to say that it didn’t take some savvy to get from A -> B.
Nah, you’re thinking of John Kerry here, who is married to the widow of the late wealthy PA Senator.  Ms. Huffington was married to Michael Huffington, a wealthy businessman who ran unsuccessfully for a Senate seat from CA and who is still with us as far as I know.  But I can see why you might confuse the two; there are a lot of similarities between Kerry and Arianna Huffington.
You are right! My bad. Both wealthy Republicans. Easy to confuse. 
And with respect to your characterization of Horowitz, how is he any different (apart from having an academia-approved ideology) from a journalist like David Corn who has spoken at SC in the past?
I can’t say that I am overly knowledgeable about David Corn so wouldn’t want to try and B.S. you. Has Mr Corn said nearly such hateful things? About whom?
See, here again you are trying to disqualify Horowitz for the content of his speech.  Who determines what is “hateful”?  Is it you and your allies?  This is exactly why people shouldn’t be given veto power over who gets to speak on campus; it always devolves into ugly censorship based upon flimsy accusations of “hate speech.”  Thanks for the back-and-forth, but I think I’ve said all I want to say on this topic.
Sure. And some policing has to be done or else David Irving would be on campus every other week because of some bozo
The answer is yes. 
Link?
Why did the Daily Trojan give space to this nonsense? Horowitz runs a website whose aim is to silence Professors who disagree with his worldview. Even notwithstanding his highly ignorant views on international affairs and race relations, this idiot should never have been invited onto a campus like USC where we value civilized debate and discussion.
Pretty funny.  And here I thought most Trojans – seeing as though something like 80% of them are liberals – wanted to silence Horowitz.
I don’t think any of us are under the illusion that we could silence him if we tried. I think we’d very much prefer not to have him on campus, though. Also, 80% is too high. It’s probably 25% liberal, 20% conservative, and the rest apathetic. It’s only conservative fever dreams when it comes to politics on campuses.
Excellent rebuttal to a very silly and dangerous attempt to spread hateful propaganda about good people. Horowitz’s is spot on in his assessment of the Palestinian movement in this country and their goal of spreading hate in the world.  Dianti should be ashamed of herself for aligning herself with these hateful organizations. Want to do some good in the world instead of promoting hate and harm to others?  Try working in the local community to help others help themselves.
Liberal fascists hate the truth.

Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
When you think about the term “millennial,” what image comes to your head? No, seriously, think about it.
If you start getting the outline of someone who is white, upper-middle class and college-educated, then the mass media has done its job. The Pew Research Center defined millennials as those born between 1982 and 20 years thereafter.
Millennials are characterized as young adults who do not have job opportunities, are tied to their technology and are more idealistic. But these qualities are only attributed to white millennials when reporting is done on them.
This group makes up a large swath of the U.S. population, and with the projected shift to a majority minority count in 2050, millennials will continually become more and more diverse. But you don’t see that diversity in the media — they are shown as just white.
It is no newfound reality that newsrooms across the country must become more diverse in order to tell and broadcast a wider range of stories about pluralistic communities. This has been the charge of affinity groups like the National Association for Black Journalists for many generations now.
If the media does not start broadening its coverage, this will negatively impact the way we view who a millennial should be. Millennials are the country’s largest age group. For this reason, race and class must be talked about when discussing problems that millennials face.
Fusion features editor Nona Willis Aronowitz explained last month why she is disillusioned at millennial coverage. Most coverage does not consider the plight of young African Americans, Latinos or Asians as a trend of their generation, but more a consequence of their own making.
“The underlying message is that working class people live in a trendless vacuum,” Willis Aronowitz wrote. “They don’t fit into navel-gazing generational narratives.”
I have heard the phrase before that “people of color don’t see themselves in generations.” And now, I’m starting to believe that this is true because our country has been so stringent on which groups are seen as dynamic and worth writing about.
The Fusion article goes on to trace the many times reporters have associated generational ties and their qualms with them to the most wealthy and white in our society. For example, the biggest gripe TIME magazine had with kids coming of age in the 1990s was that “twentysomethings” had “trouble making decisions.  They would rather hike in the Himalayas than climb a corporate ladder.” Once again, only those of means could be designated as part of this generation, leaving lower-income and browner Americans out of the national conversation about young people in this country.
I have to admit that even I have fallen into the trap of not writing about millennials in the most diverse way possible. Granted, this a college column, so many of the issues I have focused on have been related to the problems facing college-aged and college-educated millennials. But if we continue to do media coverage the way we always have, there will be no progress.
We must upend the way we report on designated generations. We must disrupt the way we think about race, class and opportunity in this country. But the facts are clear — the demographics in this country are changing, so our mindsets on these “taboo” topics must also start shifting.
So I ask again, who gets to be a millennial? Because if we continue down the path we’re on, we will further delegitimize the idea that young people of color can face the same issues of the young white Americans. Millennials are an entire generation and should not be a title for just one race.
So I call on people in the media to start broadening their term for millennial. Start using it when you go out and report about young Africans Americans in South L.A. or immigrants in East L.A. We must start giving credence to stories outside of the college-educated, upper-middle class, white narratives. That’s how change for those communities happen. That’s how all communities will grow together.
I hope that this starts to happen. But it begins with the media being more inclusive with the term “millennial.” It starts with my weekly column. It starts today.
After reading “Wait An L.A. Minute” on Tuesdays, join Jordyn Holman in her millennial conversations on Twitter @JordynJournals. She’s a senior studying print and digital journalism.
All majority-minority countries are fucked up. The USA will collapse.

For college students, this time of year is associated with what seems like endless elevator pitches and handshakes. We’re gearing up for the summer and pulling out all the stops in hopes of landing employment opportunities and paving our careers. While it’s an exciting time, it can also be intimidating and overwhelming. But have no fear! Here are a few pieces of advice that I’ve found helpful in my job-searching experience:
 
Are you looking for an internship? A research opportunity? Would you like to work at a startup or at a bigger company? To answer these seemingly endless questions, it might be helpful to make a “wish list” for your ideal internship and narrow down your search respectively. This way you’ll have a better sense of what you’re looking for, and you’ll also be able to prioritize what you think you want out of your experience. 
 
 
Don’t limit your search to just one place. Check listings with your university, your school within the university and on social media. Sites like LinkedIn and Internships.com tailor search results according to your online profile, and USC has an extensive online career portal with hundreds of opportunities. In addition to looking online, checking with different mentors and peers can prove helpful — if a professor or colleague refers you somewhere, you’ll have the added bonus of a recommendation. 
 
Applying to jobs is a time-consuming process, and application season often falls during the peak of the semester. Chances are, you’ll be juggling midterms and other academic commitments in addition to taking interviews and sending in resumes. Start your search early and pace yourself so you don’t end up compromising your time in either concentration. If you find yourself swamped with a list of cover letters to write, make a list of deadlines and try to send in one application per week. Make sure to keep track of all your applications and follow up if necessary. 
 
The right job won’t always come immediately. Sometimes it takes a few experiences to really figure out what you want in the long term, and that’s completely okay. Consider your experience level and your skills when applying to different opportunities, and focus on constant improvement. Think of it as an investment in the long term — doing the grunt work early on will build your resume, expand your network and give you more and more options as you progress in your career. Always strive to do your best, and the opportunities will come.

As someone whose parents grew up in the former Soviet Union, I’ve heard my share of Putin jokes and references to communism. When people find out that I’m a first-generation Russian-American who speaks fluent Russian, they generally tend to ask one of two things: do I love the cold? (yes) and do I drink a lot of vodka? (no). I always laugh because I know that the friends who joke around with me about Russians mean no harm. But I feel like there are real misconceptions about Russian culture and society that portray them as grim and unfriendly and portray Russia as a desolate wasteland — and if anything, my trip to Russia over spring break was about breaking down those stereotypes. 
I joined Professor Tatiana Akishina and a group of 19 USC students for the “Trans-Siberian Experience,” a course that introduces students to Russian culture and language, preparing them to travel through Russia on the Trans-Siberian Railway for spring break. Professor Akishina explained that traveling by train would allow us to interact with Russians in an informal setting as well as attempt to understand why the figure of the train has had such a strong presence in Russian history and storytelling. For me, it was also about exploring a part of the world that I felt a deep connection to but knew little about. What I found was that spending four days on a train moving east from Moscow to Irkutsk, on the shores of Lake Baikal in the heart of Siberia, was an exercise in companionship. The train cars are divided into rooms called kupes, or compartments; I shared mine with three strangers, all of whom I saw (at first) as dauntingly austere.

All I had ever known about Russians came from my parents, who are obligated to love me and thus, didn’t give me much material to know what to expect of Russian behavior. When it came to actual people who lived in Russia, I had no guarantees that they wouldn’t turn out to be exactly as American stereotypes portrayed them: unsmiling and cold. The fact that we spoke the same language wasn’t, at first, of that much help; the way I saw it, our cultural divide was too great to become friends while we traveled over 5,000 kilometers together. I didn’t know how to begin to approach someone who might not be willing to talk to me or might resent the fact that I was an American.
All of this changed when, despite my nervousness, I began to converse with Russians on the train, and I learned more about the travelers in my kupe and helped translate for the USC students in my group who didn’t speak Russian. My first night in the train, Lena in the bed across from me invited me to share food and drinks with her to celebrate her son’s wedding, and we talked late into the night about our respective lives in Siberia and America. Maxim in the kupe next door seemed reserved at first, but as I asked him more questions, he began to open up and converse enthusiastically; at the end, he offered me a taste of his salo, a type of traditional Slavic cured pork. When I visited the travelers sharing kupes with my USC friends, I couldn’t leave without fistfuls of candy that they insisted I take back.
There are two unifying themes here. First, Russians embrace a sharing culture; every interaction I had with them involved some sort of exchange of food or drink, which was not only appreciated but also assumed. We all pooled our resources together and conversed around the table because each person could have more when sharing with others rather than keeping to him or herself — this concept is ingrained in the Russian identity.
And second, the stereotype about Russians being cold and unsmiling is only true so far as first appearances go. A Russian university student I spoke with in Irkutsk said it best when she explained why Russians don’t smile at strangers: “Americans smile all the time, so we can’t tell when they’re being sincere. Russians only smile when they truly like a person, so you know that they mean it.” The Russians I spoke to were all willing to converse with me at length about everything from politics to pop culture, but it took proving to them that I was really interested.

There’s a takeaway here, and it may seem obvious: don’t judge a book by its cover. But no matter how cliche the concept of keeping an open mind may be, especially when traveling, the truth is that it can be easy to get tunnel vision without actively pursuing new experiences that challenge one’s dominant worldview. Nothing is ever black and white, and I found that even the Siberian snow and dirt comes in shades of gray.
