Speaker of the Senate Ruben Romeo presented a resolution to create a special coronavirus task force at the Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday. 
According to Romeo, the task force would respond to coronavirus-related needs, including the academics under remote instruction and the maintenance of student well-being, and assist with the transition back to an in-person semester. If passed, the task force would be a special, non-standing addition to the already existing legislative councils. It would be led by Katelyn Lee, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, and the nomination for USG’s Senior Aide. 
“The USC Undergraduate Student Government seeks to provide and support student advocacy within the current virtual semester, and to ensure such advocacy continues in the discourse over operations concerned with the potential return to campus,” the resolution read. 
Following the introduction of the coronavirus special committee resolution, Chief Financial Officer Adenike Makinde introduced the 2021-22 fiscal year budget. As USC prepares for in-person activity in Fall 2021, the student programming fee has increased back to $64, allowing for the budget to create two new funds — an accessibility fund and a green engagement fund. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, undergraduates paid a combined student services fee of $100 each during the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters that funded “various activities normally funded through separate fees,” with $13 distributed from the services fee to USG.  including the usual $64 student programming fee. The total 2021-22 budget allocation is $2,517,376.
Makinde said that although the University has announced a return to a fully in-person school year, the funding committee encourages organizations to consider both in-person and virtual programming when planning for next year. The committee also accounted for both possible scenarios when planning the budget. 
The Senate also confirmed appointments to the funding and communications departments. 
Makinde will be supported by five directors, each assigned a specific committee, including the philanthropy fund and professional fund. Three of the five directors are returning to USG under the Areias-Warren administration.
The communications department, headed by Chief Communications Officer Kros Day, will oversee tasks including the government’s digital strategy and public relations duties. The department comprises five committees, and of the 17 appointments, nine members have served in prior administrations. 
USG Judicial Council Chief Justice Ben Morain also announced the appointment of the six associate justices, which include Ayaka Kimura, a junior majoring in law, history and culture and East Asian area studies, and Caroline Vassar, a sophomore majoring in political science. Morain said that he’s “really excited” about the appointees. 
“We’ve got a diverse council, both in thought and in practice,” Morain said. “I think they’re all going to be great and help ensure equity and justice and [that] accountability continues to forge in the new administration.” 
Jeniffer Velazquez, a sophomore majoring in theatre and political science, said that many people felt that the USG President and Vice President weren’t being held accountable for their actions in the past. 
“I feel like a lot of people within my circle, people that I just happen to run across on social media or other forms of communication felt that USG wasn’t representing Trojans as they were supposed to,” said Velazquez in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “My vision is to be able to restore that sense of respect and trustworthiness in USG that is supposed to be there in the first place.”
Senators will have the opportunity to ask questions and vote on the confirmation of the new appointees, as well as the 2021-22 budget, at the next meeting.

USC Athletics announced Wednesday afternoon that women’s basketball coach Mark Trakh is retiring after two coaching stints with the university. The 65-year-old coach led the program from 2005-2009 and 2017-2021 or the past four seasons and will go down as the second winningest women’s basketball coach in school history with a 155-114 record, behind Linda Sharp.
“I can’t imagine a more optimal time for all of us to embrace a fresh start,” Trakh said in a statement released by the University. 
During Trakh’s first stint at USC, the Trojans went 90-64, played in a pair of NCAA Tournaments in 2005 and 2006, always finished inside the top five of the conference and won at least 17 games each season. After this five-season stretch Trakh retired for personal reasons
The Trojans haven’t seen the same level of success as they did during Trakh’s first tenure, as USC has not finished better than seventh in the Pac-12 since his return in 2017. The Trojans also haven’t won an NCAA tournament game since 2006 and haven’t appeared in the tournament since 2014. 
Trakh’s most recent USC squad went 11-12 during the 2020-21 season and finished eighth in the Pac-12 standings. Star players such as sophomore forward Alyssa Pili, the former Pac-12 freshman of the year, and sophomore guard Endyia Rogers, recently named to the All-Pac-12 team, highlight some of the talent Trakh recently developed in USC’s program.
Athletic Director Mike Bohn thanked Trakh for his “steadying leadership” during the coronavirus pandemic and announced the immediate commencement of a national search for the next women’s basketball head coach.

Born and raised in Los Angeles, Kyara Galloway said she saw that homelessness has “always been a problem,” but in discussions to solve it, people experiencing homelessness were often dehumanized, and spoken about in a way that wouldn’t solve the issue.
So, when she heard about USC’s plans to offer their first academic class on homelessness, she knew she wanted to partake in it. 
“I want to solve [this problem],” said Galloway, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law. “I want to be around people that want to have this discussion and be a part of the … solution to a problem in L.A. right now.” 
Created by Director of the USC Initiative to End Homelessness, Brenda Wiewel, and associate professor of social work Benjamin Henwood, the University’s first academic class on homelessness and its complexities, challenges and possible solutions will be offered in Fall 2021 by the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. The two unit undergraduate class will provide “the real basic foundation” to students looking to learn about the issue, said Wiewel. 
The curriculum addresses people experiencing homelessness in its “modern day version” as it has changed throughout history. Students gain an important understanding of how homelessness looks the way it does today, particularly with social policy and decisions, Henwood said.
“[The class] looks at [homelessness] both upstream and downstream,” Wiewel said. “[It looks at] what’s happening to the people who are actually living on the streets chronically for years, and it also looks at people who are at risk [with] housing insecurity and how does that lead to homelessness.”
Currently, The Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the School of Social Work provides special leadership development and skill-based training to master’s students going into the homelessness field, according to Henwood. However, Wiewel said undergraduate students working in service learning or internships are going into the field without essential background knowledge.
“At any level, this is a problem [people] see with their own eyes every day,” Henwood said. “Having the expertise at USC and not utilizing it to help educate undergrads and be aware of the social justice issues that are involved in this topic seems like a missed opportunity.”
The class aims to give students a better understanding of the history and contributing factors behind people experiencing homelessness through multiple perspectives.
“One of my top priorities is that when people graduate from USC, they have an educated understanding of the complexities of why it’s so hard to solve homelessness, what are some realistic kinds of issues, as well as reducing some of the stereotypes people have,” Wiewel said.
Among its complexities, the class looks at how homelessness intersects with clinical issues, inequality and racism. Henwood said he hopes to better address these intersections as he feels current discussions on homelessness “confuse some of the issues involved in it.”
“We’ll touch on a lot of what we call structural problems that contribute to the problem [of people experiencing homelessness],” Henwood said. “We’ll talk about what I think people often see, which are these obvious ways in which mental illness and substance abuse might contribute to the issue … but that’s not confined to people on the street, and so it’s not really an explanatory factor.” 
Galloway said it’s exciting to think about how increased academic knowledge on the topic of people experiencing homelessness will help in finding a solution. 
“The importance of academia and having a class like this is that we can start producing that knowledge to create a change or to create a new narrative about houseless people,” she said. 
According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, job losses from the pandemic are only set to increase the already growing homeless population. For Galloway, having a course by the University focused on homelessness in the present is different from all of her other classes. 
“[The University] has a class that’s like, ‘Here’s the moment that we’re in right now, and how can we effectively impact that moment?’” Galloway said. “I think that’s what’s so different about all my other classes is that we’re talking about previous moments and how they led up to where we are right now, whereas this class, it’s going to be in the present, and doing things I can change right now.” 
Henwood said he wants students to gain critical thinking and multiple perspectives on an issue people experience every day.
“The important part [of the class] is the use of critical theory and research and empiricism to understand conditions, and to be able to analyze both those explanatory and contributing factors to better understand why these are socially complex problems,” Henwood said.
For the future of academia, Wiewel said she hopes this class is only the beginning. She envisions additional courses within specialized topics and the development of a minor in homelessness.
“This could be a course that I imagine the demand [for] will grow,” Wiewel said. “People that are studying in a variety of fields where they see that there may be an intersection [with homelessness] would be able to take that course.”

Students are often reminded that the greatest benefit of being in college isn’t just higher education, but rather the networking opportunities available — but what about students who aren’t brave enough to seek them out? That’s why Ruiqi Li and Ana Sofía Garay decided to start “Unconventional Hustlers,” a podcast dedicated to introducing young people to a variety of different professions through honest conversations with industry leaders. 
Li, a junior pursuing a bachelor’s in the business of cinematic arts and a master’s in applied economics and econometrics, and Garay, a senior majoring in international relations and global business, both come from international backgrounds, originally from Beijing and Nicaragua, respectively. They first met as part of the international relations fraternity, Delta Phi Epsilon and became closer last spring when they and two mutual friends began an essay coaching business for international high school students hoping to enter  universities in the United States. 
The inspiration to create “Unconventional Hustlers” came from reflecting on their own experiences with mentorship in high school and wanting to increase students’ ability to network. 
“Honestly, I wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for the help of my mentors in high school,” Garay said. “I grew up in Silicon Valley, where everyone is connected to everyone. They emphasize networking so much, so that was the main reason why I wanted to start the podcast because it will also help us to get connected with other people that we would otherwise not be connected to.”
When they realized their shared interest in networking with vastly different industries, Li and Garay wanted to start a podcast that would not only help them discover what they wanted to do after graduation, but also connect young people who may not have the courage to reach out with experienced professionals with the information as well. 
“[Networking] opens you up to a lot of different opportunities,” Garay said. “I’m a really curious person, and I keep telling my friends about what I learned from different people, so one day I was like, ‘Why can’t I put this on a platform so that more people can benefit from this?’”
Another mission of the “Unconventional Hustlers” podcast, Li said, is to let listeners know that they do not have to limit their future career paths to what they are studying in college, and should be more open-minded about their options. 
“I’m a Marshall student and it’s really easy to get stuck in the traditional mindset of wanting to go into the ABC — the accounting, banking and consulting — routes, especially if you’re a business major,” Li said. “We wanted [people to] understand [that] they’re not stuck, even if you’re a business major, you don’t have to go into one of those routes. If you are an economics major, you don’t have to go into economic consulting; if you’re a bio major, you don’t have to be pre-med. You can be unconventional; you can be yourself, and here are all the different things that you can do and how you can do it.”
The target audience for “Unconventional Hustlers” includes people ages 16 to 25. Li and Garay said they hope to provide mentorship to high school students who are still discovering their career interests. 
“Especially high school seniors — a lot of students don’t really know what they want to do or what they want to study.  They just choose whatever. They’re still trying to figure that out, and this podcast is not just for college students; it’s also for high school students to give them an idea of what different options they have,” Garay said. 
Li and Garay launched the first episode of “Unconventional Hustlers” on April 6, featuring guest Alana Karen, a director at Google and author of the book, “The Adventures of Women in Tech: How We Got Here and Why We Stay,” in which they discussed women in positions of corporate power. 
“Women in tech are a minority,” Li said. “There are some women on the top and there’s a lot of women on the bottom, but there’s not a lot of women in the middle management so, it’s like, how do you get up there? There’s not a lot of people to look up to like in middle management and that’s something that we brought up in our first episode.”
Something valuable Li said she learned from Karen’s book is how to react to challenges and unforeseen situations. 
“It’s like what Alana wrote in her book — you’re always in thrive mode or crisis mode. You switch between the two of those. Sometimes you’re thriving right now, but maybe later today, you’ll be in a crisis,” Li said. 
A crisis Li and Garay faced was delaying the launch of their podcast as they waited for Apple to approve it. Looking back, they realized it gave them more time to organize their intern team and prepare more diverse episodes featuring speakers from different industries. 
Cal Poly Pomona senior Matthew Enriquez, the marketing manager intern responsible for coordinating social media posts and building Unconventional Hustlers’ online presence, said he particularly enjoyed listening to the interview with Amit Garg, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley.  
“I used to be a big fan of [‘Silicon Valley’] … and actually hearing his advice for what makes a good founder to start a good company was really inspirational,” Enriquez said. “I think the biggest piece of advice is that there is no one direct path that you can see immediately … As long as you have a positive attitude and that ability to hustle, honestly, you’re going to be fine.” 
Though Enriquez said he did not previously have experience with podcasting, he was motivated to intern with “Unconventional Hustlers” because of their unique mission that benefits many young people entering the job market in similar positions as himself.
“Something I struggled with for a while as well was finding a mentor in an industry that I wanted to be in to seek advice from,” Enriquez said. “So I think it’s a great idea for a podcast especially because [people] may not have someone they can turn to and hear someone’s story about the path they took, and I think it creates some reassurance.” 
In the future, Li and Garay hope to invite industry gurus from foreign countries since almost 20% of their current listener audience is international, Garay said. Because both Li and Garay are bilingual in Mandarin Chinese and Spanish, respectively, they are also considering holding future podcast episodes in other languages to expand the accessibility of mentorship in their podcast to non-English speakers. Enriquez also hopes to increase listener engagement by introducing a way for listeners to submit questions and to potentially hold live recordings in the future. 
Garay cites her habit of not being afraid to reach out for help as the reason why the “Unconventional Hustlers” podcast was able to get off the ground. She built the intern team by emailing around 50 professors from nearby universities offering internship positions, and found industry experts by constantly reaching out to people on LinkedIn and keeping the contacts of guest lecturers and other distant network connections. 
“The answer is always going to be no if you don’t ask for it,” Garay said. “This semester is my last semester at USC … so I told myself, most importantly, that this semester is gonna be about getting out of my comfort zone and [have] no regrets. So, this is one of the things that I’m doing in order to get out of my comfort zone. I sometimes get nervous when I speak with guests or like other people that are higher up. So, this is a way for me to get out of my comfort zone and to be more confident.”
Li said she also wants to remind listeners to be confident in pursuing their aspirations and being open to unconventional opportunities. 
“What I want to tell other people is, don’t be afraid to make your idea into a reality because three months ago, this was just an idea in my head that I had,” Li said. “Now it’s very much a reality and I kind of can’t believe that we have a team; we’re launching. And I think  just do what you want to do and don’t be afraid of it because there’s really not much to lose.”

What do people write about for their last column? I could shout out my Daily Trojan boss. We could talk about hopes for the future, those little “what ifs” that we dream will bring us closer to media than ever before, even though I don’t believe that. So we’re going to talk about choices. And capitalism.
Appearing in the 1970s and snowballing in the years since is what Andrew deWaard, assistant professor of media and popular culture at University of California, San Diego, calls ‘financialization’ — “the accelerated growth of the financial sector and its extractive logic, which relies on financial engineering rather than commodity production.”
DeWaard’s argument in “Financialized Hollywood: Institutional Investment, Venture Capital, and Private Equity in the Film and Television Industry” builds on those of film and media historians Janet Wasko, Thomas Schatz and Jennifer Holt in that conglomerates still control the filmmaking process in a devastating way, only now they are “mere investment and profit-extraction opportunities for truly powerful firms such as Blackrock, Vanguard, Bain Capital, TPG, and Silver Lake…”
BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are investment firms, owning about 88% of the companies on the United States S&P 500, a stock market performance index that looks at the top 500 performing companies. Combined with minimal financial regulation, these firms took ownership of competing interests in the same industries (such as Apple and Microsoft being owned by Vanguard and Blackrock, respectively) and, in turn, jacked up prices and kept worker wages low as ever. 
Media companies are already under threat, with the investment firm Vanguard owning the largest stakes in Disney, Comcast, Time Warner, Verizon and AT&T, and mere second largest stakes in CBS and Netflix. Private equity firms leverage debt against a company, buy it, achieve “maximum efficiency” by cutting out labor that digs into profits and then sell that new skeleton of a company to someone else at a much higher price. 
Left behind in these acquisitions and eviscerations are product-forward initiatives, diverse and burgeoning talent and the capacity for these media companies to work toward their best in terms of the media they create. More and more people are losing their jobs, prices continue to soar and those who act as the eviscerators are earning more than ever before. These financial tactics are basically unregulated and are sure to worsen.
Any introspection that focuses on the state of our economic system and capitalism as a gutting force also requires some personal consideration. 
One of the things that USC has boasted about our educational experience is the real-world opportunities and connections. If you are looking at a post-graduate position or a summer internship, it is extraordinarily difficult to reconcile your position with the greater scheme of these corporations. 
That being said, it is also extraordinarily difficult to find a position that’ll offer resources for even the minimum in terms of cost of living. We’re being thrust into a world that, for some, forces a confrontation between moral values and quality of life. I don’t have an answer for you or for anyone else’s particular situation — like I said, these are choices.
What we get out of life often is explained in trades or exchanges, something that I’ve hopefully come in contact with in this column. Attending film school is one of these exchanges, putting you in a position that is often overwhelmingly aware of the deterioration of media as we know and love it, all in order to bring the studies of film and TV closer to our hearts. 
Whatever you end up doing, be conscious of your passions, however fleeting or changing, and prioritize them. There are too many forces willing and ready to take advantage of them. And, of course, thank you for reading.

Women’s tennis will face its first round of Pac-12 Championship play later this week, marking their first chance to compete for a conference title since 2019. The Trojans last won the conference in 2015.
 USC will head down to San Diego with a largely different and more developed team than the one that last saw championship play two years ago, a team that made a semifinal run during that time. In the year prior to the semifinal run — head coach Alison Swain’s first year with the Trojans — the team only made the quarterfinals.
 Swain’s changed squad hasn’t had too much success in the regular season, faring worse than their last complete season in 2018-19. Currently, they’re 5-5 on Pac-12 play with a 0.500 average on the entire season, a decrease from their 2018-19 stats, which put them at 7-3 in conference with a 0.714 overall winning percentage.
 The upper hand heading into the weekend is the amount of match play the Trojans have been able to see.  
 “We have two players on our team who haven’t been to Pac-12 before,” Swain said. “But those players are grad transfers who have played in conference championships and postseason before, so they have that experience.”
 Swain herself has experience competing for — and winning — big titles, too. Prior to USC, she led Williams College’s women’s tennis to eight division level championships.
 Under Swain’s leadership, USC will need every ounce of that experience and will need to see the ball well during the most crucial points. The Trojans’ prior Pac-12 matchups have come down to a few make-or-break deuce points.
 Arizona State — a team that knocked USC out of the most recent championships — lost to USC three weeks ago and marked the Trojans’ last win heading into this weekend.
 To defeat teams like Cal, UCLA and Stanford — the Trojans’ three most recent losses and teams they’re more than likely to see if they make a deep run — USC will need to play like how they played Arizona State — or better.
 Despite losing the doubles point to Arizona State, the team was able to rally in singles and capture five of the six first sets. USC’s aggression paid off and it will need to be on display when up against the might of other conference powerhouses.
 USC’s fight for control of the matches will likely be backed up by the individual skill sets of each player, such as the counter-punching focus of redshirt senior Summer Dvorak’s game, and the team’s continued effort of rooting each other on — as they’ve been some of each other’s only spectators throughout the season.
“Reenforcing the positive self-talk, telling ourselves that we can do it,” junior Salma Ewing said. “We’re a very solid team and just believing in ourselves in those moments because we’re right there and in those deuce points and in those games, just being able to execute.”
 The team will spend the next few days practicing and running through their normal drills, although tailoring practices to each player’s specific needs.
 “I’m trying to focus on my footwork, my mental toughness,” Ewing said. “Also, just [focusing] on playing freely and swinging through my shots.”
 As the Trojans look to hang in the most defining moments, they’ll need all the grace they can get on the court.  And while a bracket has yet to be determined, USC could play in the first round as soon as Friday, and, if not, they’ll begin their quest Saturday.
 “Everything’s single elimination at this point,” Swain said. “It’s just one match at a time.”

We finally made it to double digits!
This is the 10th installment of my column and I couldn’t be more psyched up about it. Who would’ve thought that my ramblings would make it this far? Since I’m in the mood for special occasions, today’s column will be about a historical event that just happened on Twitch. 
Of course, I’m talking about Ludwig’s “subathon.”
For those of you who don’t know, Ludwig is one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, currently holding the record for most subscribers ever on the platform — nearly 300,000 in mid-April. His popularity can partially be attributed to his “subathon,” a concept where, as long as people continue subscribing, his stream will keep going. In Ludwig’s case, he started streaming on March 14, with one sub adding 10 seconds to the stream’s duration. He also put a 31-day cap for the length of the marathon stream.
This is not, by any means, a new idea. But because Ludwig was already well known before he decided to start this journey, his “subathon” is by far the one that attracts the most attention, already allocating space for him in the Twitch history books. And also because he streamed for all 31 days. 
Ludwig ate on stream, he showered (with shorts) on stream and he slept on stream. Almost every aspect of his life was broadcasted to thousands of people. In a sense, it felt like a real-life Truman show.
So why did we keep watching?
It’s not as if every second of the stream was filled with planned content. There were many times where all he was doing was joking around with his roommates or reacting to random YouTube videos. But he still managed to attract thousands of viewers at any given time. 
So what’s the secret?
There is no concrete answer to that, since every person had a different reason to tune in. I’d wager that many joined simply to see how long it would actually go. All I can do is use my own experience as a basis.
Yes, yes, the cat’s out of the bag: I watch his streams. I’d like to say that it’s because I’m a well-attuned columnist who flocks to good stories (or any other fancy LinkedIn-able excuse), but this was genuinely out of luck. Ludwig is one of the few streamers I follow routinely, and I’ve been watching him for almost two years now. When he announced his “subathon,” I didn’t think too much of it. 
And oh, how wrong I was.
Ludwig’s stream is memorable, not necessarily because of its sheer length, but because of the community that formed thanks to it. 
Usually, popular streamers don’t develop a very intimate community organically because there are too many people to interact with on a personal basis. Because Ludwig’s never-ending stream breaks tradition and allows viewers to take a peek at his normal life, the audience seems to have developed a community on its own. 
For the first time, some of my real-life acquaintances tuned into his stream. Browsing through Twitter, I found countless posts about his content, made by people ranging from professional journalists to random students. I even made some new friends by interacting with those tweets. And when I focused only on his Twitch chat, I was still left with a feeling of unity; it is as if behind every user who was typing, there was someone who felt the same as me, happy to be a part of this moment.
I know it might seem like I’m exaggerating, but it only takes a glance at the final minutes of the subathon to truly understand what I’m saying. The overall togetherness was so palpable that even Ludwig himself had to hold back tears when saying goodbye. Later, when I talked to my friends about the stream, many admitted to also being on the brink of crying. Not necessarily because they were sad that a historic event was ending, but because each of them had a specific connection to the stream. For some, that was the place where they met their best friends. For others, it’s what made them start streaming. Regardless of what the product actually was, hundreds of thousands of people now shared a similar, deeply personal connection with this stream, even if inadvertently. And that is extremely powerful.
I could talk about what the esports industry can learn from this, but this time, I won’t.
Ludwig’s streaming career is far from over, so there might be an even more poignant lesson to learn from all of this in the long run. But the main reason why I won’t go on about that is because it simply isn’t my objective. As a rare exception to the overall trend of my articles, I wrote this column to showcase what will certainly go down in the collective memory of Twitch. I also wrote it to make sense of my own experience with the stream, which mirrors those of other viewers. More than giving a suggestion, this column is a recognition of all of those who came to watch his stream, even if it was just for a couple of minutes. 
While we may have been born too early to explore the stars, we at least watched a streamer go through his own odyssey together. And there is some magic to that.

Content Warning: This article contains references to police-inflicted racial violence.
Last weekend, thousands of people took to Logan Square on Chicago’s Northwest side to demand justice for Adam Toledo, an unarmed 13-year-old Latino boy who was shot in the chest and killed by a Chicago police officer in late March. The officer claimed that Toledo was holding a firearm in his hand and posed a threat, but body camera footage showed Toledo’s hands as empty and raised at the time he was shot. Toledo’s mother described her son as an imaginative, goofy and curious boy who loved animals, legos, pizza, zombies, cartoons and, ironically, wanted to be a police officer himself. 
Roughly 400 miles away in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, residents gathered to demand justice for Daunte Wright, an ambitious and unarmed Black man who was fatally shot by a tenured veteran officer on April 11 outside a Minneapolis suburb. Wright, who was 20 years old, was a doting father and had hopes of becoming an NBA player, fashion designer and business owner.
When initially stopped by the police, Wright called his mother. The police then asked him to step out of the car and hang up the phone, attempted to arrest him, and then pursued his car as he drove away. Kim Potter, who is being charged with second-degree manslaughter, has maintained that she thought she was using a taser instead of a gun, although many authorities have reported that it would be nearly impossible to make that mistake. 
Faced with trauma and outrage, Minneapolis residents — who were already apprehensive about the then ongoing Derek Chauvin trial — have called for accountability and justice through emotional protests on Brooklyn Center streets, walkout demonstrations in 118 schools across the state and candlelight vigils at the scene of his death. Many other demonstrations were held across the country in solidarity with Minnesota.
Wright’s murder occurred roughly 11 miles from where former Minneapolis police officer Derrick Chauvin murdered George Floyd last May and where Chauvin was standing trial for the murder the world saw him commit. Chauvin is now convicted guilty of second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
Though the deaths of Wright and Toledo have been highly covered by the media, there have been many other instances of police shootings throughout the country. Nine hundred eighty- two people have been shot and killed by the police in the past year, according to a Washington Post investigation that began after police killed Michael Brown, an unarmed Black man, in 2014.
Toledo is one of three known youths killed by the Chicago Police Department. Anthony Alvarez and Travon Chadwell also became victims of CPD within two weeks of each other. CPD has murdered at least twelve minors since 2013, and the department has killed more children than any other law enforcement agency in the United States. 
As reported in the Washington Post investigation, there have been 924 police shootings in California since 2015. 
Two weeks before Toledo was shot in Chicago, the Los Angeles Police Department shot six people over a seven day period: on March 16, LAPD officers shot two people in separate instances less than two hours apart from each other — one of which occurred right outside of USC; less than 24 hours later, LAPD shot someone in Hollenbeck while in a moving vehicle; two days later, LAPD shot another two men during separate instances — one man walking by MacArthur Park who the police acknowledged as either mentally ill or intoxicated, and another shot during a traffic stop; the last shooting during the seven-day-period occurred when the LAPD shot a Black man near Koreatown and Pico Union early morning, before the sun had even risen.
Earlier this month, the LAPD released body cam footage of the events that led up to the fourth shooting, which shows officers follow a Latino man acknowledged by them as intoxicated or mentally ill down a street near MacArthur Park. The officers followed the man, later identified as Samuel Ponce, for fifteen minutes while shooting him with their foam projectiles as he repeatedly yelled out, “help me, holy father.” After cornering him on a curb, an officer pulled out a gun and shot him. 
According to the Office of the Inspector General, of the LAPD initiated stops in 2019, 47% were Hispanic, 27% were Black and 18% were white, identifying deep racial disparities. Policing is also most prevalent in low income Black and Latinx communities such as Central L.A., which has a rate of police stops four times higher than West L.A., which is over 70% non-Hispanic white. Additionally, once the officers initiate the stop, Black and Latino males are more likely to be asked to step out of the car, have their car searched, receive a pat-down-search and get placed in handcuffs. 
Police officers, who are meant to ensure safety on their assigned constituencies, impose grave harm on Black and brown communities.
Regardless of where one stands on policing, people must realize the degree to which police officers fail to serve Black and brown communities, especially when lives are taken at such high rates. How many innocent Black and Latinx children will have to grow up being stopped and harassed by the police, or even lose their lives, before society realizes the lack of accountability and the dire need for reckoning involved within our current policing systems?
In a society where a common reaction to injustice is performative activism, we must stay vigilant. Media coverage and public outrage spread like wildfire in the days and nights following the incident, but after the spark dies down, the cycle starts again. We must stand with Black and brown communities across the country to demand change. 
If not, then the cycle will continue. We can’t just wait for police to shoot another person like they killed Toledo and Wright. Even when no incident occurs, Black and brown people still fear for their lives walking down the streets or at a stop, knowing the police will not protect them. 
Still skeptical? Let this sink in: On Tuesday, just minutes before Derek Chauvin was convicted for three counts of murder for the killing of George Floyd last May, the Colombus Police Department in Ohio shot and killed a 16-year-old Black girl named Ma’Khia Bryant, a high school honor roll student, outside her foster home. 
The cycle continues: after a year long odyssey to convict Derek Chauvin, another innocent Black life is taken at the hands of police. We must stay vigilant in confronting the systematic oppression and brutality that policing causes Black and Brown communities. Regardless of the circumstance, police are not executioners. There is no justice. There is no peace. There is only murder, racism and injustice disguised under the pretense of a badge.

Plunge into a nostalgia-tinted trip, if you will, to experience the wonders of IMAX 3D and ICEE-induced brain freeze. As the lights dim, you throw the cardboard frames you were handed at the door over your eyes. Close one eye and the world turns red, the other and it turns blue — or take the glasses off, and the illusion of 3D gives way to eclectic chaos.
American politics is a messy affair — in many ways, it resembles a 3D screen without glasses. Issues are abundant in their quantity and complexity, and yet we are not only told to look at them through a red or blue binary but to etch that view into our identity. Our choice will inform the media we consume and the people we surround ourselves with, so choose wisely. 
Of course, this is a simplistic picture that does not quite capture the nuanced identities within each party, ranging from revolutionary idealism to pragmatic realism on the left and from a measured brake to a militaristic backlash on the right. Reactionary politics suggests an inevitable pendulum swing from left to right, with the moderacy or extremism of each swing determined by the urgency of the moment. But is a pendulum swing truly inevitable? 
Constituencies have diverse needs, so competition between them is certain. However, it is reductionist to suggest constituencies are so homogeneous that they can only be serviced by one ideology. How else can we explain over a million Sen. Bernie Sanders supporters voting for former President Donald Trump in 2016? Our understanding of a linear left-to-right political spectrum seems incomplete. Coalitions do not necessarily split at the center of the political spectrum and swing voters are not exclusively moderates. 
So, why only have two major parties? Wouldn’t the American people benefit from more options? What even are parties and what do they do?
In their theoretical essence, political parties are a loophole to the Constitution’s system of checks and balances. The Founding Fathers sought to distribute power by creating three “co-equal” and separate branches — one to create, one to execute and one to interpret laws. None with the power to do all three. 
Enter political parties. Through coalitions, interested politicians realized they could sidestep the checks and balances and control all levers of government. One central organization could finance campaigns for congressmen and presidents that could appoint ideologically aligned judges once elected. 
In modern times, the financing both parties amass is staggering, all but curtailing the competitive ability of independents. This is especially true for the highest offices in the nation, where even the most successful independent candidates (such as Sanders) align themselves with a party to have a shot. 
How else could they compete? In the 2020 presidential election, Democrats spent $6.9 billion overall, while Republicans spent $3.8 billion on a single candidate. But joining a party is a prerequisite, not a guarantee for competing — barriers to entry do not end there. In February 2020, none of the seven presidential candidates remaining could be categorized as “ordinary” Americans. Two were billionaires, four were millionaires and the last was a Harvard alumnus.
The two parties dominate down-the-ballot races, as they play a numbers game to attain a majority. In districts deemed “safe,” party recognition alone should be enough to carry a candidate to victory. The other party might not even go through the trouble of nominating a candidate. In the most contentious districts, both parties spend billions to maximize competitiveness. In all instances, independents face steep uphill battles.
Federal spending is allocated to political parties every year further tilting the slopes. Consider the 2020 election, where total federal spending on presidential campaigns was over $6 billion, and total federal spending on congressional campaigns was over $7 billion. In our twisted reality, tax payers surrender their self-determination to political parties who they pay to prescribe them their candidates. 
Political parties do their part, deciding who can run for office and who cannot. Their decisions take into consideration a candidate’s electability and background but only once party loyalty is ensured. Like movie producers casting actors, political parties “cast” candidates.
Nothing maximizes winning probability like a good narrative. Like writers, parties weave fiction and nonfiction into elaborate tales propagated to their followers. Seeing the world in red or blue, the American public becomes ever more polarized, and American democracy ever more unstable. If the election were stolen by blood-sucking pedophiles, would you storm the Capitol gates?
In a time before political parties, our first president warned a young nation. “[In] the course of time and things,” George Washington foretold that political parties would “become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government.” After more than 200 years of reification, we have come to accept parties as natural realities of American life. 
Does politics in the land of “opportunity” provide anyone any such thing? Or is power static, festering in the same circles? 
In 2021, cynicism remains on the rise. A year ago, when voter turnout reached a 120-year high, 33.7% of eligible voters still chose not to participate. The remaining 66.3% became ever more polarized, while politicians played with fire for personal gain. Is it time to re-imagine the two-party system?
Take off the glasses, America.

Have you ever felt the need to purchase the newest iPhone? Do you get a new phone because you want to keep up with the trend or because your old phone has slowed down after a system update? Whatever the reason, you have either participated or been forced to participate in the throwaway culture.
The booming technology industry is constantly presenting new technological devices. From phones and laptops to tablets, e-readers and smartwatches, people have become reliant on these devices for navigating their daily lives. This is especially the case for college students since their academic work and social lives constantly require electronic devices. A series of student discounts provided by tech companies also increase the temptation. 
However, electronic devices do not last forever. Nowadays, the average time for people to upgrade their phones is around two years. The fact that many tech companies release new electronic devices on a yearly basis, often advertising better, newer functions and faster speed, provides a constant incentive for people to follow trends and purchase new devices.
Both individuals and tech companies are responsible for cultivating throwaway culture. A report issued by the United Nations Global E-waste Monitor 2020 claims that electronic waste has become the world’s fastest-growing domestic waste stream. This problem was primarily caused by the increased consumption of electric equipment, short equipment life cycles and few choices for repairing broken electronics. 
Influential companies including Amazon and Apple propel throwaway culture. Amazon does not provide any repair services for its Kindles, which means consumers either have to fix their e-reader by themselves or trade it in to get a new one. 
While Apple does provide repair services for their electronic devices, that does not necessarily reduce the frequency of people changing their phones. In some cases, getting an iPhone repaired can be just as expensive as buying a new one. In addition, Apple’s “batterygate” revealed that the company actually tries to slow down the performance of some iPhone models without informing consumers in order to encourage purchases.
Since both tech companies and individuals are participating in throwaway culture, there lies a series of environmental problems and financial burdens that need to be addressed. The Global E-waste Monitor 2020 indicated that the world has produced over 53.6 million metric tonnes of e-waste in 2019. 
Among 2019’s e-waste, only 17.4% was recycled. The report also estimated that the total amount of e-waste produced in 2030 will reach 74 metric tons, which is “almost a doubling of e-waste in just 16 years.” If not recycled properly, most e-waste will end up in landfills or get incinerated, releasing toxic substances such as mercury to the environment, leading to a host of health consequences, including lead poisoning, respiratory problems and cardiovascular disease.  
Although there is no one-time solution to this problem, there are certain measures that people can take to prevent themselves from participating in throwaway culture. 
Students must overcome the temptation to get the newest electronic devices if their current devices are still functional. They should also consider getting their devices repaired instead of making an order for a new one right away. Students can also bring their old functional devices to certified recyclers, pass them on to someone else in the family or try to resell them online after wiping all personal data. 
Tech companies should not only provide more incentives to encourage people to recycle their devices but also repair services to make devices last longer. Furthermore, they should also strive to prolong the usable life of their electronic devices. Meanwhile, the government can also encourage more documented formal e-waste collection to further boost recycling rates. 
The frequent turnover of electronic devices is only one part of throwaway culture, and it must not be ignored. It is important for everyone to put effort into the reduction of e-waste, as it will not only save money but also help to promote a more sustainable environment.
