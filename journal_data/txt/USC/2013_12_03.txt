USG passed a resolution Tuesday night to work with administrators to regulate the activity of solicitors on campus. As a result of student feedback through a survey, USC will create a new section in SCampus to define the university’s policy regarding on-campus solicitation.
USG Residential Senator Matthew Prusak spearheaded USG’s effort to reform USC’s on-campus solicitation policies.
“This resolution is seeking clarity. I interviewed solicitors, as well as the scheduling office and DPS. It turns out there is no policy, rather a ‘checkerboard’ of different policies,” Prusak said.
According to the recent online survey, 99 percent of the student body reported being approached by solicitors asking for financial or commercial gain for themselves or their organization.
“This resolution has been a long time coming,” Prusak said. “I’ve been doing research this semester … the student feedback was overwhelmingly negative.”
Eighty percent of students surveyed reported feeling uncomfortable as the result of an experience involving on-campus solicitors. Furthermore, 82 percent of students surveyed supported banning solicitor activity on campus altogether.
Though survey results indicate students resent solicitation overall, Prusak acknowledged that the actions of a few solicitors could have skewed student perception of solicitors in general. He said he believes representatives of approved organizations can benefit from the resolution, which will not ban solicitation altogether, but clearly define policies and regulate them more closely.
“There seems to be a consensus that if you ignore one solicitor, you tend to ignore them all. This resolution could actually be helpful for solicitors who operate from a table or stationary location,” Prusak said.
In the survey, students reported individual solicitors acting in an offensive manner. There were reports of solicitors interfering with campus tours, obstructing bike lanes and even sexually harassing students in some cases.
“There seems to be a lot of ignorance. Going forward, we want to educate solicitors on what they can and cannot do,” Prusak said.
USG will work with administrators to create a policy that best represents the interests of the student body. Once enacted, DPS will enforce the new policy on campus.
“I really like this resolution. This is an issue that we need to put into policy in order to be dealt with,” Greek Senator Jamie Dick said.
Two hundred and seventy-six students participated in the online survey, which was conducted by USG in late October. The resolution passed in the Senate by a unanimous vote.

Six USC scientists were named fellows by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a nonprofit organization that publishes the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Honored · The American Association for the Advancement of Science has recently elected six USC professors as fellows for their work in biology. – Photos courtesy of USC Dornsife and Keck School of Medicine
The AAAS 2013 elected fellows include Frank Gilliland, professor of preventive medicine; Robert Maxson Jr., professor of biochemistry and molecular biology; Rob McConnell, associate professor of preventive medicine; Kenneth Nealson, professor of earth sciences and biological sciences; Nicos Petasis, professor of chemistry and Berislav Zlokovic, professor of physiology and biophysics.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Gilliland and Maxson both said they felt honored by the title. Gilliland researches preventive medicine with a focus on conditions that plague Los Angeles. He started out as a doctor treating patients but said he wanted to prevent rather than simply treat diseases.
“I became more interested in preventing disease in the first place, and a bunch of environmentally related diseases are entirely preventable,” he said.
Gilliland said his group focused on children’s respiratory health, studying what environmental factors influence conditions such as asthma. Gilliland also researches obesity, a public health issue that is receiving a lot of attention in the scientific community.
“We’re finding that it’s not just calories in and calories out that is driving the obesity epidemic, and it appears that the environment plays an important role as well,” Gilliland said.
Despite the air pollution and obesity health concerns that still plague Los Angeles, Gilliland said that air quality has significantly improved in the last five to seven years. Gilliland said he has seen children’s health improve with reduced air pollution.
“It’s quite gratifying to see that the research that we’ve done has resulted in new policies, new regulations and reduced air pollution and we can show that it is resulting in improved health for the kids growing up here in Los Angeles,” Gilliland said. “So that’s even better than being a fellow.”
Both Gilliland and Maxson said that USC has a very collaborative working environment for scientists.
Maxson said he started at USC’s medical school in 1983 and had few colleagues to directly interact with. This prompted the small group of molecular biologists to work together through activities such as group meetings.
“There are not a lot of places that have that kind of camaraderie, where people really kind of care about each other and help each other,” Maxson said. “Other places where I’ve spent time, the doors are all closed and you don’t talk to the guy down the hall because there was some kind of rivalry.”
Maxson, who has worked at USC for 30 years, said he was fascinated by developmental biology after taking a class as an undergraduate.
“The overall question is how genes control different aspects of embryonic development.”
Maxson works with a specific cell population called the cranial neural crest. His group discovered the genetic basis for a birth defect called craniosynostosis, where the skull bones fuse together and cause an unusual skull shape.
“A lot of what we do is directly related to birth defects in humans,” Maxson said.
His group has also worked on the heart, studying defects in cardiac outflow. Maxson said that not all of his work has had obvious practical applications, though.
“The wonderful thing about science, it’s also something that’s very difficult about it, is that every day is different. You come into the lab and you have different problems to solve, but I think probably the biggest challenges are just operating in the funding environment in the U.S.,” Maxson said. “I’ve spent a lot of sleepless nights putting together grant proposals.”

Using USC Library archives, Nathan Masters, the manager of academic events and programming communications at the USC Libraries, partnered with Gizmodo to launch Southland, a blog dedicated to reviving the history of L.A.
“The idea is to use Los Angeles as a microcosm to explore the way cities have evolved, the way cities are changing today,” Masters said. “Not that Los Angeles is necessarily exceptional in any way; like I said in my introductory post, L.A. has a sort of unexceptional exceptionalism.”
The blog launched Nov. 25. The idea for Southland came from recognition of Masters’ previous work with writing Los Angeles historical pieces for Southern and Central California’s community television station KCET.
Gizmodo, a reputed technology blog owned by Gawker Media, recently began to expand its scope to include urbanism and design. When Gizmodo Editor in Chief Geoff Manaugh saw Masters’ regional historical work on KCET, he approached him with the idea to launch Southland, a proposition Masters eagerly accepted.
Southland’s pieces, however, are more than historical: They examine the role of the physical land Los Angeles occupies in its history.
“Southland is a play on words; we’re sort of using it as a metaphor. We’re examining the city’s relationship with the land,” Masters said. “For instance, lost landscapes and forgotten infrastructures are two key terms we’ve used. Roads, sewers, electric power lines, aqueducts — those are ways a city can expand its reach and grow in size.”
Yet, Masters is taking it further, looking at what the area was like before this infrastructure existed.
“Southern California has undergone a landscape succession. There’s the indigenous state of the land, before Europeans came, you know — native plants, the Gabrielino or Tongva Indians. In the San Fernando Valley there was wheat farming, there was citrus farming, and then they were cut down and replaced with suburbs. That’s what we mean by lost landscapes,” Masters said.
Masters publishes biweekly stories that draw on various aspects of Los Angeles history. He extracts images from USC Libraries and its member collection “L.A. as Subject,” a division of the libraries that aims to preserve, archive and share the history and culture of the Los Angeles region.
“Southland and our other media partnerships complement the already really strong regional history collection we have here,” Masters said. “Our regional history collection serves scholars here on campus. There are some amazing faculty members who are really at the leading edge of understanding Los Angeles and they make good use of our materials, but scholars from all around the world travel here to access our collections.”
Masters, an Anaheim, Calif. native, started the blog to show that the history of Los Angeles is not necessarily how Hollywood portrays it.
“A lot of people think they know all about Los Angeles. Especially because it’s the subject of a lot of films, people feel like they know things about Los Angeles,” Masters said.
Yet the fact that the blog is so region-specific poses an interesting challenge for Masters.
“How do you get people all across the country and all over the world to care about Los Angeles?” Masters asked. “One of the best ways is to surprise people. If you can, turn people’s assumptions about the city on their head.”
Since launching the blog, Masters has already debunked a number of myths about Los Angeles history. In his first post, he made it clear that there was never a war declared on the Los Angeles streetcar system, and that the city in its natural state was an agricultural hub — not a desert as people commonly believe.
Unlike on other blogs, readers of Southland can comment directly on the archival photographs. One can simply click anywhere within the photograph and the interface crops a square of the image so that they can comment on a smaller area within the larger photograph. Masters said this allows for active reader participation.
Masters said reader comments have been overwhelmingly positive. Most recently, Southland received attention from the popular tech blog Boing Boing. The blog has also received a number of positive reactions from the USC community.
“Southland looks like it will provide a unique look at the history of this area covering more than just popular icons such as Hollywood, but equally important stories that might otherwise be neglected,” said Camille Saucier, a sophomore majoring in psychology who works at the USC Libraries. “I appreciate that USC is contributing some of its vast resources towards such community project.”

USC Dornsife Associate Professor of International Relations Jacques Hymans was awarded the University of Louisville’s 2014 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order.
Only four Grawemeyer awards are given annually, recognizing work in education, world order, music composition and psychology. Each winner also receives $100,000. Hymans is being recognized for his progressive book, Achieving Nuclear Ambitions: Scientists, Politicians and Proliferation. The book has also received the American Political Science Association’s 2013 Don K. Price Award and the National Academy for Public Administration’s Louis Brownlow Award.
“I’m very grateful and pleased that the book seems to be striking a chord,” Hymans told USC News. “For years, the conventional wisdom in Washington has been that the world is on the verge of a generalized nuclear free-for-all … overreactions to a phantom threat can be extremely costly.”
Hymans’ book discusses the challenges that developing nations face in building successful nuclear programs and emphasizes their high rate of failure. According to the book, the leaders of these developing nations have unrealistically high expectations for the development of successful nuclear weapons and for how much time this process will take. Hymans argues these factors have implications for how the United States should negotiate with these countries, such as Iran, because the conversations are perhaps not as immediately threatening as the developing nations’ leaders make them appear. Hymans’s book brings to light an exaggeration of the nuclear power developing nations hold and helps disillusion the “nightmare scenario.”
“Negotiate with care, but also with confidence,” Hymans told USC News. “Even if the current talks break down, an Iranian nuclear weapons breakout is not imminent. At the same time, if there is a reasonable deal on the table, take it.”
Hymans is already a recognized author for his 2006 book, The Psychology of Nuclear Proliferation: Identity, Emotions and Foreign Policy, which received the International Society of Political Psychology’s Alexander L. George Book Award and the Mershon Center’s Edgar S. Furniss Book Award. He plans to continue his research on the effects of nuclear efforts. Currently, he is researching how the 2011 Fukushima Nuclear disaster in Japan has affected the country politically, a project funded by a Mellon Fellowship.

Undergraduate Student Government is conducting a survey to better understand student frustrations with the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Library and to determine if a renovation could address these issues.
Addressing issues · Undergraduate Student Government’s survey lists a set of issues that include study space and comfortable furniture. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
“We’re hoping to use this survey to get some data to see how big of an issue this really is for students, if they care about it or if they don’t care about it,” Michael Yoshimura, USG director of academic affairs, said.
The survey, which was officially launched on Monday, asks students if they believe Leavey Library should be renovated and how it could better suit students’ academic needs.
“The key part of the survey is the question: ‘Do you think Leavey should be renovated or not?’” said Hassaan Ebrahim, USG assistant director of academic affairs, who works with the USC Libraries. “That’s the data we’re really trying to get a massive amount of responses for to show the administration that this is very important to students.”
The survey provides a list of issues that students have previously voiced as concerns and asks which of those, if any, should be addressed in a renovation. The list includes sufficient individual study space, group study space, quiet study space, desktop computers, electrical outlets and comfortable furniture.
“It is a great meeting place for studying due to the library’s large size,” Richard Martin, a junior majoring in business administration, said. “Its high capacity is a plus, but there are not enough areas where groups can study.”
Martin said he studies at Leavey at least once a week. Other students, however, have not encountered many problems.
“I think Leavey Library is good how it is now,” said Nickole Zhen, a second-year graduate student majoring in financial engineering.
In 2011, USC Libraries, with the help of architects from Carrier Johnson, completed a comprehensive needs assessment and architectural study of Leavey Library to create a detailed renewal plan.
“Pedagogical trends only point to the need for greater mobility in learning technologies and greater flexibility in space designs,” the report reads. “These trends must be incorporated into Leavey Library or it will rapidly lose relevance to USC students.”
The $20 million renewal plan aims to solve infrastructure and space-allocation problems by expanding collaborative workspaces by 38 percent, classrooms by 65 percent and reshaping the first floor to provide 171 percent more student-focused areas, a cafe and a front terrace.
“I think we probably need more space in general,” Winnie Liang, a senior majoring in biological sciences, said. “So the best we can do is utilize the space we have better.”
The renewal plan proposes moving the first-floor offices to the fourth floor to create more usable space for students.
In addition, USG members hope that changing the desks will deliver a better use of space.
“The desks were made for computers in the 1990s and we don’t need that much space on desks anymore,” Yoshimura said.
Ebrahim agreed with the need for new furniture.
“A lot of work that we do as students is collaborative, so having furniture that can be easily moved from individual space into collaborative work environments would really help,” Ebrahim said.
Though these alterations aim to cater to students’ academic needs, many students said they dislike Leavey Library because of its environment.
“My least favorite thing would be how dismal it seems inside,” said Ashley Sykora, a freshman majoring in global health. “I’m not sure it’s necessarily the most important issue concerning the library, but I feel that kids would study there more often if the inside was more welcoming and cheery.”
Aimee Dang, an undecided sophomore, agreed with Sykora’s opinion.
“It’s pretty depressing in there,” said Dang, who said she visits Leavey Library once or twice a semester. “They could probably make more natural light or windows.”
The renewal aims to address these complaints by improving the atmosphere of the library.
“We want to increase natural lighting so that it feels more open and homey, not necessarily as institutional,” Yoshimura said. “[Leavey Library] was built in 1994 … the whole role of the library has completely changed.”
Academic Affairs hopes the renovation will accommodate both technological needs and learning environment needs.
“It’s not a matter of Leavey needing to be completely rebuilt,” Ebrahim said. “It’s that it needs to be upgraded to match the needs of the students of the 21st century.”

Four members of the volleyball team were named to the all-conference team on Tuesday when the Pac-12 announced its 2013 postseason awards.
Three-peat · On Tuesday, senior libero Natalie Hagglund was named the Pac-12’s Libero of the Year for the third straight season. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
 
Senior libero Natalie Hagglund was honored as Libero of the Year for the third consecutive year since the award’s inception in 2011, and freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu was voted Pac-12 Freshman of the Year by the 12 coaches in the conference. She is the third Trojan freshman to win the award in four years.
On the Pac-12 All-Conference Team, sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio joins Hagglund and Nwanebu, along with senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard, who was first recognized last season with an honorable mention.
The Women of Troy had the most players on the all-conference team, ahead of Stanford’s three.
Nwanebu also earned a spot on the All-Freshman Team with setter Alice Pizzasegola, while All-Freshman honorable mention went to outside hitter Elise Ruddins.
Hagglund has the most digs in the league and is 14th in the nation with 5.43 per game. She is also USC’s all-time career leader in digs with 2,292. This season, Hagglund is the 10th USC athlete to be recognized with three all-conference awards in her career.
Nwanebu has won a league-record of six Pac-12 Freshman of the Week honors this season.
The sixth-seeded Women of Troy finished the season with a 16-4 Pac-12 record. The team begins postseason play on Thursday, Dec. 5 at 7:30 p.m. at the Galen Center against New Hampshire in the first round of the NCAA tournament.

After earning the No. 1 seed in the upcoming NCAA Championships, several members of the USC men’s water polo team were honored with Mountain Pacific Sports Federation postseason awards.
Senior driver Nikola Vavic was named the conference player of the year after scoring 75 goals in 2013. It is his third time being named to the MPSF First Team. Vavic is now USC’s all-time top scorer with 248 career goals.
Junior driver Kostas Genidounias and senior utility Mace Rapsey both made the All-MPSF First Team, while senior goalie James Clark earned a spot on the All-MPSF Second Team. Senior two-meters Jeremy Davie and Connor Virjee earned All-MPSF Honorable Mentions.
Genidounias is the Trojans’ leading scorer this season with 76 goals. Genidounias has scored 175 career goals during his USC career. Rapsey has scored 47 times this season and currently ranks No. 20 on USC’s all-time career goals list. Clark has averaged 9.6 saves per game.
Honorable mentions Davie and Virjee have scored 27 goals and 49 goals this season, respectively.
The Trojans began the MPSF tournament as the No. 4 seed before beating No. 5 California 12-9 and No. 1-seeded Pacific 18-13. USC moved on to win the title match against No. 2-seeded Stanford, automatically earning a ticket to the NCAA tournament.
USC was able to bounce back and win the MPSF tournament after enduring a relatively disappointing regular season. The team lost four games, including three conference games en route to a fifth-place finish. The Trojans’ resurgence should give the team a boost as it heads to the NCAA Championships.
The tournament will take place this weekend in Palo Alto, Calif. Top-seeded USC will play the winner of the UC San Diego-St. Francis Brooklyn match tomorrow. The title match will take place Sunday at Stanford’s Avery Aquatic Center. If USC wins, the Trojans will be the first collegiate water polo team to win six consecutive national championships.

In each of the past three seasons, the USC women’s volleyball team has been stopped short of their preseason aspirations of winning a national championship. This year, with an unprecedented amount of young talent on the roster and three seniors hungry to reach new heights, the Women of Troy look to do something they haven’t done in ten years — bring a national title back home to Los Angeles.
Looking up · Senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard (right) hopes to lead her team to an NCAA championship in her final season at USC. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
Three years ago, libero Natalie Hagglund, middle blocker Alexis Olgard and outside hitter Sara Shaw, all current USC seniors, were freshmen on a star-studded roster but saw their national championship dream end when they were beaten in the national semifinals by California. A year later, the Women of Troy were knocked out in the same round, this time by Illinois. Last season, USC suffered a surprisingly early exit from the tournament when they were ousted by Texas in the fourth round.
These early exits have allowed USC’s three senior leaders to amass a wealth of experience that will help them aid their largely young and inexperienced team through new territory. The Women of Troy finished the regular season with a strong 26-5 record (16-4 Pac-12), good enough to finish third in a very competitive conference and rank No. 7 nationally.
Hagglund, who was just named the Pac-12 Libero of the Year for the third straight season, is ready to take advantage of every moment of the tournament.
“I’m excited because it is my last tournament to compete in,” Hagglund said. “This is the last time I have to play with this team and this group of girls and shoot for that championship.”
For the Women of Troy, team unity might be just as important this year as anything else. Though in the past, USC has boasted talented teams heading into the tournament, head coach Mick Haley believes there is something special about this current group of players.
“This is the tightest team that I’ve had in a long, long time,” Haley said. “They really take care of themselves and they take care of each other. They’ve got each others’ backs, and it’s a team that’s continued to get better throughout the season.”
Though team chemistry is invaluable for USC, there are still flaws that must be corrected if the Women of Troy are to make a deep tournament run. Inefficient hitting and inconsistent play led to some surprising losses, including a sweep at the hands of an unranked Arizona team in October and a disappointing loss at Washington State just a few weeks ago in five sets. Through the season, though, the team has learned to look past those setbacks and learn from them heading into the next matches.
“I’ve learned that you can’t overlook any team,” Hagglund said of her experience this past season. “This year has been a prime example of that … These teams are all going to be great teams; there’s 64 of them and it’s going to be a lot harder than we think it is to get past every single team.”
The first test for the Women of Troy will come this Thursday night when they take on the Wildcats of the University of New Hampshire. The Wildcats were 20-12 this season with a 12-2 record in the America East Conference. Though they suffered a seven-game losing streak earlier in the season, the Wildcats are currently on a nine-game winning streak, including a thrilling five-set win in the America East championship game two weekends ago. Though New Hampshire posted a stellar 12-1 record at home, its road record was a mere 7-5. Fortunately for USC, its next two games (and possibly four, should they make the regional round) will be at home in the Galen Center.
If the Women of Troy can defeate the Wildcats, they will face the winner of Thursday’s other match between Colorado State and Cal State Northridge. USC has not faced any of the three teams in its bracket yet this season, but their unfamiliarity with them is not a cause for concern.
“It’s going to be interesting to see different things,” said sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio. “Each team has something different so it’s going to be really exciting for us.”
Haley, though also optimistic, knows that no team will be an easy opponent in the tournament.
“I’ve seen the teams that we could play,” Haley said. “The New Hampshire team runs a lot of different things that we haven’t seen. They’re scrappy, they serve very well, they have a couple of left-handers and they’re unconventional with their style. We’ll have to be ready for that.”
Should the Women of Troy advance past the first two rounds, they can expect to start seeing some familiar opponents. Nine Pac-12 teams qualified for the 2013 NCAA tournament, the most of any conference in the nation and the most in Pac-12 history. Three of those teams earned a top-16 seed: Washington, Stanford and USC.
The players are anxious to improve upon last season’s fourth-round exit, but most of their motivation is for the seniors on the roster to end their careers with a national championship.
“We look forward to winning,” Bricio said. “But the thing I have in my mind right now is that it’s the seniors’ last year. I’m looking to win for them.”

Monday was certainly a crazy day in Troy. It was a spectacle unlike any other as we witnessed the intersection of business and emotion. Throw in the volatile nature of social media, and this explosive concoction of variables proved to be great theater and fodder for lots of chatter.
To fully understand the somewhat puzzling events that transpired Monday, we have to understand all of the intricate pieces first. There was the hiring process, this year’s closely knit football team, a passionate fan base and 24/7 media coverage of the season.
The catalyst that ignited the emotional outbreak Monday was the businesslike manner in which Steve Sarkisian was hired. Much like the firing of Lane Kiffin, Athletic Director Pat Haden acted quickly and efficiently, leaving little time to spare. If a similar process had unfolded in a private equity firm, I imagine Haden would be applauded for his efforts.
USC football, however, is not corporate America. While logic and reason should trump emotion, it just doesn’t for fans and players in college football. So hiring a coach less than 48 hours after a demoralizing loss to UCLA is certainly going to rub some people the wrong way in any situation.
It seems even more callous when put into context with the emotional makeup of this year’s team. Ed Orgeron was more than just a coach to the Trojans. His upbeat demeanor and gregarious attitude created a bond with players and fans alike. He took over a program devoid of emotion and put the fun back into football.
Losing that type of connection after a magical eight-week run was a tough pill to swallow for some middle-aged fans, whose only interaction with Coach O was through the lens of a camera. It’s hard to even imagine the emotional toll this took on players who grew exceptionally close to Orgeron after spending extensive time with him on a daily basis.
Whether or not Coach O was treated unfairly in this situation, many players and fans’ perceptions is that he got the short end of the stick. This feeling was only exacerbated when Orgeron left his final meeting with his players in tears. For a unit whose mantra was “one team, one heartbeat,” the sting of seeing your leader cry is naturally going to create intense emotions.
When 18 to 22-year-olds —myself included — feel anything, they take to social media to vent their frustrations. Unlike most college-aged kids, USC football players have been put under a microscope by fans and a press corps hungry for any piece of information. This combination of factors created a solemn environment around the football program Monday.
On its own, this situation poses a multitude of issues. Then, the fan base gets involved. Sanctions or no sanctions, USC fans demand excellence, plain and simple. If you are proud of a nine-win season, you can go across town. We wanted a Nick Saban or Urban Meyer-esque hire, and anything less feels unacceptable. Sarkisian isn’t Saban -— not yet, anyway — and the fact that he was hired so quickly only added fuel to the fire. The ties to Lane Kiffin didn’t help, nor did the fact that Orgeron had a better record in the Pac-12 this year than Sarkisian ever has.
Pleasing the entire USC fan base on any occasion is nearly impossible. This hire didn’t even come close. Just like firing a coach in an airport hangar is a public relations disaster, so was this firestorm. By ignoring the emotional aspect, and approaching this decision from a purely analytical and business perspective, the USC Athletic Department did itself a disservice.
That is not a critique of Sarkisian, just the process in which he was reintroduced to the Trojan faithful. I personally am a fan of his hire, and even if I weren’t, now is the time to stop complaining and rally around the new coach. As fans, there is no need to further aggravate the situation by complaining and criticizing.
At the end of the day, there wasn’t a single coach out there who had the caché of Saban or Meyer. Truth be told, USC doesn’t need either of those guys to win a national title. I was a big proponent of Coach O getting the job, because I think all it takes to win at USC is recruiting prowess, the ability to motivate and great assistant coaches. As long as our coach isn’t aloof, stubborn and pedantic, we as fans have nothing to worry about.
Sarkisian brings all of that to the table and more. Tosh Lupoi is a recruiting maven, and Justin Wilcox is one the best defensive coordinators in the country. Soon enough, Sarkisian’s outgoing nature will win over the fan base.
Monday was a hectic day and took a toll on all parties involved. I predict, however, that in three years when Sarkisian and Max Browne are holding up a crystal football, everyone will be fondly reminiscing about this decision, much like we did when Pete Caroll and Matt Leinart won their first national championship. At the end of the day, there is only one thing that will forever extinguish this firestorm. It’s the only thing that cures an ailing program and appeases a hungry fan base: winning. Let’s give Sark and company a chance to do just that — win.

Uh, at this moment it doesn’t look like Justin Wilcox or Tosh Lupoi is coming with Sark from Washington.
You ignore 2 facts: 1) Haden’s team spent 2 months doing detailed evaluations of over 25 candidates including initial vetting by a search firm, and conducted interviews with the 5 leading candidates, and 2) there is a Dec 15 deadline to sign 4 EEs or we lose those scholarships. 
Haden had to act quickly. He picked the best candidate. The Trojan Family needs to come together at this time and support Coach Sark and AD Haden. This can be the start of something special and it doesn’t need any negative energy. Sark has a lot to do and he will be faced with only 70 scholarship players (assuming 5 juniors go early) in 2014, so he has to get the new coaching staff, win over the current players, and finish strong with recruiting. Let’s help him do that.
This hire sucks!
Nice Article! Everyone at SC just loved and respected Coach O and wanted him to stay. Initially even I was terribly disappointed by the Haden’s handling of the situation and very sad to see Coach O go. But perhaps that was the only possible approach Haden could have taken. Coach O obviously had Head Coaching aspirations and it was clear he was not in Haden’s bigger picture. Keeping him until the bowl game would have made it further more difficult and would have affected recruiting adversely once they let him go. At the end of the day this has been a really unique year in SC’s football history made truly special by Coach O and the players and we should be happy that SC football is in good hands with Coach Sark and the crystal ball should be coming soon to the Heritage Hall.
What you failed to mention is that we have to fill the four early enrollee scholarships by Dec. 15, or we lose them.  With the sanctions still in place, every single scholarship player is crucial.  
While the timing of replacing was painful (who DIDN’T like Coach O?), in the long-run it might be better for Troy with 4 solid players committed to Coach Sark (perhaps a surprise in the bunch), and to Coach O who has a better opportunity to pursue head coaching opportunities at this stage in the coaching carousel. 
My two bits…
Pat Haden’s decisive leadership should be celebrated and revered.  We have only to look at the abysmal record of the previous AD to appreciate what Pat’s real leadership looks like.  Coach O deserves praise for a job well done and his disappointment is understandable.  But the “interim” in his head coach title said it all.   Haden has done a masterful job of managing expectations and making tough decisions.  Most importantly, he has made those tough calls quickly, decisively and with compassion for those impacted.  Yes, he cut his teeth in Corporate America and on the ‘SC gridiron too.  Perhaps, the lessons learned there do apply to USC Football.
Very well said!

On Tuesday, Steve Sarkisian was introduced as USC’s head football coach at the John McKay Center, ushering in a new era for Trojan football. The introduction comes one day after former interim head coach Ed Orgeron resigned from his position and held an emotional final team meeting.
All in the family · With deep ties to USC and the Trojan football program, new head coach Steve Sarkisian returns as USC’s head coach. Sarkisian was one of five finalists interviewed by Athletic Director Pat Haden. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“It’s obviously difficult, but at the end of the day it’s a business,” redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler said. “I think our team has done a great job of understanding that — especially this year, [since] we’ve had three head coaches in one year … [But] we’re very excited to have a great leader like Coach Sark. I’m excited to get started with him.”
Sarkisian, 39, was a quarterbacks coach, assistant head coach and offensive coordinator for USC under former head coach Pete Carroll from 2001 to 2003 and 2005 to 2008. Most of that time was spent alongside Lane Kiffin, who was fired from his head coaching position in September and replaced by Orgeron for the remainder of the season.
Orgeron guided the Trojans to a 6-2 record to complete the season, headlined by a massive upset of No. 5 Stanford, and gained support from many fans who believed he deserved to have the “interim” tag removed.
Athletic Director Pat Haden, however, decided to hire Sarkisian, who helped win five Rose Bowls in his seven years at USC and reconstructed a Washington program that was 0-12 in the season prior to his arrival.
“Steve resurrected a moribund program in Washington,” Haden said. “He has relationships with local [high school] coaches, and he knows the Pac-12 and USC.”
Sarkisian brought his wife and three children to the press conference, where he declared his passion for USC and seemed at ease with the media horde surrounding him.
“To be home, to be the head football coach at USC, is just awesome,” Sarkisian said. “This is a once in a lifetime opportunity that I felt like I had to take advantage of and jump on the first chance I got it.”
The Torrance, Calif. native didn’t hold back from explaining his expectations for the program, saying he expected USC to resume competing on a national level immediately.
“We are not rebuilding at the University of Southern California,” Sarkisian said. “‘Rebuilding’ is not a word around here. Coach O proved that we can win right now.”
Orgeron certainly reinvigorated USC’s fanbase — not to mention, its team — and was offered an assistant head coaching position and pay raise by Haden. But the man affectionately known as “Coach O” chose to pursue a head coaching opportunity in lieu of his success at Troy, and held an emotional meeting with the Trojans on Monday afternoon to inform them of his decision.
“I respect his decision; it wasn’t like he abandoned us or left us,” Kessler said. “When he started talking yesterday in the meeting, you could see it in his eyes and his voice that he was beyond crushed.”
The team was likewise dismayed, as several players left the McKay Center in tears, feeding the notion that some of the squad’s players who are eligible for the NFL Draft might be encouraged to leave school early in wake of Orgeron’s withdrawal.
Some of those knee-jerk, dejected emotions seemed to dissipate after a team meeting with Sarkisian later that night. But only time will tell if the new head coach can convince some of the Trojans’ most talented players to don the cardinal and gold for one more season.
“Right now, emotions are high,” said redshirt junior safety Josh Shaw, who said he’s currently leaning toward staying at USC. “Maybe a guy feels like he wants to leave right now. But in two weeks he gets to sit down and talk with Sark and see the new staff, see the new scheme, then he’d probably be encouraged to stay.”
For now, the Trojans are looking forward to participating in a yet-to-be-determined bowl game, in which they’ll be coached by offensive coordinator Clay Helton.
“We’re gonna go out there and do it for ourselves,” Shaw said. “We worked hard this whole season; we’ve been through a lot. It’s another opportunity for us to go out and have a 10-win season, which is a positive for all we’ve been through this year.”
With a permanent head coach in Sarkisian, it seems as though the chaos that has surrounded USC football since the disappointing 7-6 campaign last year might finally be coming to a close.
But the program still has plenty of work to do before it can claim a return to national relevance — a charge Sarkisian hopes he’ll be the one to lead.
“I came here to win championships,” Sarkisian said. “We’re gonna recruit the kids with the desire, the kids with the character that can embrace that [mentality] and want to do something special here.”

So this means we will have four coaches in 2 1/2 months. Nice body of work Mr. Haden. We’re hiring a coach that has a record that can’t compare to Coach O’s record, even as short as it is. 9-4 with 6 pac 12 wins. There’s a lot of us out here that are praying for Marcus Allen as AD. So President Max, if this sound ludicrous to you, Maybe an exit strategy should be your next big move.
“It’s obviously difficult, but at the end of the day it’s a business,” redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler said. “
Cody seems such a sincere guy, I can only imagine the struggle for him and the rest of the team to emotionally adjust to Pat Haden’s deciison. 
It was “business” with Lane kiffin with predictable results. It became trust, hope and passion with Coach O which led to abrupt improvement. A return to “business” would not bode well for USC
Welcome to the transformed U$C.
Just watched video of news conference introducing Coach Sarkisian.  Coach S seems to have a “tell” when he’s responding to or commenting upon something that  is discomforting for him in some manner: he touches his earlobes.

California is teeming with fitness enthusiasts. With the opportunity to hit the beach every day of the year, keeping toned is a top priority in the Golden State. For Sam Mazumdar, a 2010 Marshall School of Business graduate, what he wears when he exercises is as important as the workout itself. That’s why he invented SilverAir, a product that puts a spin on traditional athletic apparel by infusing odor-repellant silver into the product.
Sterling idea · Waiz Rahim (right) and Sam Mazumdar (left) are currently selling a line of clothing infused with silver in order to repel natural body odors. Their products are currently available online. – Photo courtesy of Sam Mazumdar
“When I try to describe Y Athletics to someone, I tell them that if Apple were to design clothes and open a retail store, it would be Y Atheltics,” Mazumdar said.
Y Athletics has succeeded at emulating the more well-known corporation. Like Apple Inc., products the little details in Mazumdar’s product seems to be lifted straight from Steve Jobs’ distinct vision. The shirts currently come in four colors: jet grey, surf blue, salmon red and shamrock green. But aesthetics aren’t the only quality that sets Y Athletics apart from the rest. The actual manufacturing is what makes it groundbreaking.
For one, as the name suggests, SilverAir utilizes silver to repel body odors.
“When you sweat, your sweat has a lot of proteins in certain areas. Those proteins give birth to bacteria that have odor. Your body absorbs the bacteria that does not have odor and is left with the bacteria that has odor. When you sweat, that bacteria gets retained in your shirt itself. When moisture reacts with silver, it gives off diversions that infiltrate the membranes of the odor-causing bacteria and break them down so they cannot grow anymore. This is why you have a shirt that doesn’t smell after a few hours,” Mazumdar said.
Besides the unique inclusion of silver, the breathable fabrics are created from yarn that’s imported from Italy.
“We use a very high-tech technology called seamless knitting — the yarns are knitted directly into the shirt. On the side of the shirt, there is no stitching. It is all just one piece,” Mazumdar said.
To fund his project, Mazumdar harnessed the power of social media and the online community. He quit his previous, full-time job in July to invest his heart and soul into Y Athletics and launched a Kickstarter campaign on Oct. 28. In just a couple of weeks, the project gained 2,696 backers and garnered $167,881 in funds. Backers can purchase the product for $34 a pop (a $20 reduction from the retail price). When asked about the reason for the markdown, Mazumdar explained that his financial model reflects the strategy of the online retailer Amazon.
“We took hints from Amazon in terms of growth. They run on a thin profit margin,” Mazumdar said. “We want to grow as a company and profits aren’t important to us right now. We want people to experience this product and this brand.”
But the Kickstarter campaign couldn’t have been possible without the help of another Trojan. Mazumdar brought Waiz Rahim, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering, on board to help him create the promotional material and video used to showcase the product to potential investors. Rahim quickly became invested in more than just the promotional video.
“The entire start up experience was very exciting — it’s something I’m very passionate about,” Rahim said.
Rahim might have only been with Y Athletics for the past three months, but his connection to Mazumdar has much deeper roots.
“He is more like a brother to me,” Mazumdar said.
Mazumdar and Rahim are family friends. Rahim and Mazumdar’s sisters are best friends. Mazumdar is also Rahim’s best friend’s cousin — and their family friend’s fiance.
Regardless of the complexity of the connection, it’s clear that the duo have a brotherly affinity for one another. This friendship gives Y Athletics a greater sense of heart — something that’s much-needed in small businesses.
Looking to the future, Rahim and Mazumdar plan to focus their efforts on outreach and publicity to help their fundraising efforts. They hope to expand their line of apparel, which is currently limited to menswear, to include a women’s line as well.
“Mom and Dad still don’t know about this project,” Rahim said, laughing.
At the speed that this project is taking off, it’s clear they’ll be finding out very soon.
Ok, I’m not trying to be a killjoy or anything but when I saw the headline I was interested to know what new technology had been invented to repel odor and was little disappointed to find out that it’s just a repackaging of a technology that is well known and is widely used by other apparel companies. The oxidation of silver to kill odor generating bacteria has been known for decades and a number of patents already exist in this area. So, the infusion of silver is not unique and nothing has been “invented” here. Perhaps the packaging and branding is new. Anyway, peer reviewed scientific studies have shown the infused silver particles are washed away from the fabric just after two launderings and may end up polluting the environment. And I’m not being paranoid nor am I a Bruin (I am also a Trojan).

Everybody enjoys a good game of tag. The premise is simple: Run around and hit unsuspecting players so that they are then “it.” But what if that playground staple took to the streets and become brutal, even deadly? This is the Knockout Game.
The Knockout Game is a potentially fatal series of attacks that are reportedly occurring throughout American cities and even in London. It is a violent phenomenon that appears to be spreading across the country as virally as any other less-serious trend. Just like tag, the rules of the Knockout Game are painfully simple. People run up behind an unsuspecting victim and punch them as hard as possible so the pedestrians are knocked out, or at least knocked to the ground.
Brooklyn, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C. have all seen instances of the Knockout Game in which victims have reported being hit from behind with enough force to cause considerable injury. Ralph Santiago, a 46-year-old man from Hoboken, N.J., died after his neck snapped and he got caught in an iron fence. Fatalities also occurred in Syracuse, N.Y., and St. Louis.
The culprits behind these attacks are not hardened criminals. Instead, they are mere teenagers. Three juveniles, all between the ages of 13 and 14, were arrested for Santiago’s murder. These crimes are alarming on their own but the young age of the attackers should be cause for further alarm. Why do young people think harming others is an acceptable pastime?
Violence pervades modern pop culture. Almost every action film nowadays requires at least five explosions and any superhero flick out there is guaranteed to include a scene of mass destruction. Grand Theft Auto V, a video game constructed around violence (among other vices), is the fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billion. Consumers have developed a distinct taste for violence.
It’s no wonder, then, that teenagers at home and abroad are resorting to violence in the real world as a means of entertainment. All of the products teenagers buy show them that violence means fun. Violence earns you points and gets you what you want: money, sex and power.
In Brooklyn, these attacks originally targeted Jews in neighborhoods such as Crown Heights and Midwood. Elderly people and other minority groups such as blacks have also been attacked during instances of the Knockout Game. As is always the case with crimes committed by minors, the severity of punishment is hotly debated.
Now that your sensibilities have been properly scandalized, it is worth mentioning that The New York Times reported that the Knockout Game might actually be just an urban myth and that the attacks in question might be nothing more than the sort of random assaults that have always occurred. Media broadcasts have sensationalized a string of isolated incidents, according to Police Chief Anthony P. Falco Sr. of Hoboken. Gene Rubino, a spokesman and assistant prosecutor in the Hudson County prosecutor’s office, agrees with Falco. “We keep getting asked that question and there is no noticeable trend,” Rubino is quoted as saying by the Times.
Who should we believe? Obviously the Times is one of the most reputable news sources in the English language. But can these incidents really be disregarded as isolated incidents sharing a few similarities? It’s hard to pick a side when both seem to have their merits.
Such is the fickle nature of a trend. Whether the Knockout Game is a verified trend or just another case of yellow journalism, this example demonstrates the public’s penchant for sensationalism. Trends are a way for people to cross lines and push boundaries. Sometimes, lines are crossed that should not be questioned in the first place, as is the case with the Knockout Game. Harming others for the sake of entertainment is not an activity that is worthy of replication across the country — and it never will be.
On the other hand, fashion and food trends occur because creative types constantly want to try out new ideas. Clothing styles become increasingly bizarre with each season because designers always aim to outdo each other. Likewise, TV shows repeatedly toe the line with content that challenges censorship.
Without trends, nothing would evolve. Trends encourage the advent of bigger and better concepts. They also remind us of our social limitations. We are unwilling to tolerate the increase of violence against unsuspecting victims on the street, yet our culture also supports a video game product that encourages the very same act, albeit digitally.
The designation of something as “trending” is entirely subjective. One person could view the newest craze as a thing of genius while another person could view the same fad as completely pointless. In a field such as dance, trends are the medium through which dance progresses. Without Elvis’ swaying hips in the ’50s, there would be no grinding today. Good or bad, we owe a lot of thanks to trends for allowing our society to grow.
The Knockout Game is evidence that some trends truly are negative. Popular media should not encourage accepting violence as normal yet products such as GTAV are still sent to the masses. Awareness about what’s trending is vital to maintaining your cultural relevance, no matter what interests you. Nobody wants to be the derp at a party who has nothing to contribute to the conversation.
Being interesting to others is all about being timely. A trend is just that: a timely topic. Not all trends, however, are created equal. Sometimes they are absolutely horrendous, such as the reports of the Knockout Game. Other times they are ridiculous, as is the case with seasonal flavors such as White Chocolate Peppermint Pringles.
It’s all well and good to know about the current trends but at the end of the day, your own opinion is far more important than a hashtag. And by stating your own thoughts regardless of others’, you might end up being the next trending hashtag.

Trace Gaynor is living a life many students can only dream of having: he won a Chipotle contest and can now enjoy free Chipotle for a year. He said luck has been pretty good to him in the past year — but it has more to do with the fact that Gaynor, along with the Filipino boy band The Filharmonic, will be contestants on NBC’s singing competition, The Sing-Off, premiering Dec. 9.
Big dreams · Trace Gaynor has a strong background in music; he grew up playing violin and piano and his father is a composer for TV shows. – Photo courtesy of Trace Gaynor
Gaynor is a senior majoring in broadcast and digitial journalism and double minoring in marketing and cinematic arts. He works as a tour guide at USC and is also in charge of the arrangement for the on-campus a capella group, the Troy Tones. Though it might seem like a typical student workload, Gaynor faces the unique task of balancing school and work with his life as a contestant on The Sing-Off.
And while he never saw himself singing in a band, Gaynor is competing against nine other groups with the other six members of The Filharmonic.
“I didn’t really sing much in high school,” Gaynor said. “Troy Tones was the first singing group I’ve ever been in. I did talent shows but I didn’t make choir or anything like that.”
Though he seems quite humble, Gaynor did not exactly fall into singing. He came from a strong musical background. Gaynor is originally from Chicago, where his father still works as a composer for television shows. As a child, Gaynor grew up playing piano and violin while occasionally singing in his parents’ studio in their basement. In his freshman year at USC, Gaynor auditioned for Troy Tones, later serving as president his sophomore year. An alumnus reached out to Gaynor about auditioning for a new Filipino group who planned to audition for The Sing-Off.
“[On] the day we met, we did a video audition and filmed our audition for the show,” he said.
Gaynor found out he had been cast for the show in April, but NBC did not allow him to say anything. His immediate family knew, as did his roommate and the Troy Tones, but he had to keep the secret from his friends. When asked where he was, Gaynor would say, “Can’t tell you, can’t tell you. But it should be cool though; you’ll find out soon enough.”
The Filharmonic played a benefit concert last month which was the first time they were able to formally announce their participation on the show. The response, Gaynor said, was unreal.
“I’d never had anything like this before. It’s just unbelievable,” Gaynor admitted. “It’s crazy.”
Gaynor credits his family with keeping him grounded even as he goes on a nationally syndicated television show.
“They think it’s funny. My sister makes fun of me all the time,” he said. “She’s a junior in high school, so it’s naturally what a sibling would do.”
Gaynor decided not to tell his parents that he was auditioning until after he received confirmation that he made it onto the show. Once he did tell them, however, their first concern was for his schoolwork. After resolving that issue, Gaynor said, his parents were very supportive.
“My dad always said you gravitate to what you’re good at, so he wasn’t surprised that I landed back into music,” Gaynor said.
But Gaynor admitted that the life of a musician is far from easy. He dedicated his entire summer to taping The Sing-Off. NBC moved all of the groups to apartments in Culver City for the duration of the taping. They filmed one episode per week, with rehearsals lasting from 7 a.m. to about 11 p.m. every night.
Aside from covering songs a capella, each group also had to perform dance routines for every performance and were mentored by judges, including Jewel, Ben Folds and Shawn Stockman. Gaynor called it an exhausting process, but one that led him to meet some amazing musicians in the other groups.
“Part of the reason this show is so much fun is meeting all these unbelievable people,” Gaynor said. “These people are so much fun and so good and I learned so much from them. And I met some of my best friends.”
Gaynor holds an appreciation of the other groups’ talent, but still believes The Filharmonic held its own in the competition.
“People like The Fiharmonic. We are relatable, you know?” he joked. “We’re likeable.”
It would be hard not to like someone who works hard for his goals while still balancing a normal life. Gaynor reflected on how much his life has changed in the past year.  As a current USC student, Gaynor is also an ensemble member in the Cardinal Theatre production of Rent this January. He plans to apply the skills he learned as a journalism student to a career in the entertainment industry.  He hopes to graduate next May and has already held a number of internships, ranging in everything from sales to voice consulting. In fact, he has a job offer waiting for him with professional voice coach Nick Cooper. Cooper has worked with many stars including Beyonce and Nicki Minaj and hired Gaynor as an intern last semester.
Gaynor  credits the Trojan Family for many of his accomplishments.
“I wouldn’t have had these opportunities if I had gone to school elsewhere,” he admitted.
Though impending graduation does make him slightly nervous, for now Gaynor is taking everything that comes with being on a nationally televised show in stride.
“If there’s any time in my life where I could live this ‘faux-stardom’ thing, this is the time to do it. And just getting a feel for this sort of lifestyle because if I want to work in entertainment, I’m going to be doing this,” he said.
If his current success is any indication of the future, then Gaynor might very well need the practice to handle the fast-paced lifestyle of working in the entertainment industry.

A homeless man who once recycled boxes from the street becomes a furniture builder. An immigrant mother who is unable to pay medical bills loses her child to illness. These are the stories of the residents of the University Park Campus community that have been woven together to create the 24th Street Theatre’s Ladybird, a play which casts members of the community, with four performances from Dec. 7 through Dec. 15.

For resident Ivonne Rodriguez, her story as a first-generation immigrant is one that is shared by many members of the cast. With both parents having emmigrated from Mexico and enduring a difficult trip to the United States, Rodriguez grew up in a low-income household and did not graduate from high school until recently earning her GED certificate.
“A lot of us are parents and almost all of us are children of immigrants, or some of us still have our parents in Mexico,” Rodriguez said. “So there’s that recognition that it was a tough upbringing for a lot of us.”
Rodriguez first entertained the idea of community theater after her oldest son became involved with the theater’s “After Cool” program, which offers education and enrichment in the arts to students. After the theater received a two-year grant from the James Irvine Foundation Exploring Engagement Fund, Rodriguez’s suggestion of including adults in the productions became a reality.
“I was always fascinated by what the kids were able to come up with and create,” Rodriguez said. “Fast forward to years later, and they had the opportunity this year. For me, it felt like a no-brainer. I’ve been asking for it, I’ve been wanting this — why not throw myself into this type of project?”
Before writing the script, the first few months of production were composed of story circles, where cast members would sit in a circle and tell stories of their lives, of hardship, of migration and of family.
Director Laurie Woolery said that while she and co-writer Victor Vazquez did have a text to build off of, the parallels between peoples’ stories were drawn organically.
“Initially, we were inspired by the story of Gift of the Magi, just because we knew we were dealing with parents, and we knew, to a certain degree, details about that community — a lot of them are immigrants,” Woolery said. “What the community gives you expands and contracts [the story]. It’s not at all the Gift of the Magi, but it still has that essence of sacrifice, of the things that we carry, the things that we pass on and what we need to let go of.”
Executive Director of 24th Street Theatre Jay McAdams said that the expansion into community-based theater — Ladybird being the theater’s first major production to do so — comes as a result of the shift in modern theater.
“There’s this growing discussion in the non-profit sector, which is about how things are changing in the arts,” McAdams said. “Now that we all have iPhones in our pockets, we make our own playlist, we are watching videos on demand … Why shouldn’t we create art that way too? Rather than just come to a theater to sit down and watch a play, why shouldn’t they be able to get up on stage and be in the play?”
The other reason behind this new form of entertainment is that it falls in line with the theater’s history of outreach in the community.
“We do a lot of work with the community, everything from helping people get to their parole hearings, to helping families that are having domestic issues, to getting free books for kids for Christmas,” McAdams said. “Most theaters doing a play with the community — it would be kind of an odd thing. For us, it’s sort of hand and glove with our mission, which is serving the community and using art to make a difference.”
And according to Woolery, the community gives back in their own way, too. Working with amateur actors has allowed her to recognize that every person is an artist with a story to tell, and each member’s willingness to tell that story inspires her and shapes the work that she wants to do in the future.
“Giving speeches is listed up there as one of the top five terrifying things people do,” she said. “To witness everyday people, who don’t necessarily see themselves doing this, and walking through their fear, working with each other and really putting themselves out there — not just physically but emotionally — is incredibly inspiring. It’s not some big, self-sacrificing thing that I’m doing — it’s the ultimate artistic collaboration as far as I’m concerned.”
Rodriguez said that many of the cast members were parents of children in the same program as her son, whom she had met “after performances or in line together getting a tamale,” but never really gotten to know.
“You get to know their name and where they’re from, but this project was something deeper than that,” she said. “Now you get to understand people’s stories, and you start to see the similarities in everyone’s struggle. As people are speaking in this group, this energy that is collected is so enriching. It’s empowering. You walk out of that room and you just figure, ‘Wow. These people that you think you know are these heroes to their children, to themselves and to their families.’”
For the rest of the cast, it came down to having enough time to make the commitment to coming to rehearsals and learning their lines.
“A lot of us are parents, almost all of us work and some of us have two jobs,” Rodriguez said. “Whenever someone didn’t make it, it was interesting how they would come to the next meeting and they would say, ‘I just had to come because I needed it.’ It sort of became therapeutic in a sense for a lot of us.”
Despite the obstacles, everyone was able to come together in a way that Woolery hopes will inspire the audience to reach out to one another and hear each other’s stories.
“The struggle that people endure, and yet still remain moving forward trying to live a good life and trying to be good people, I find incredibly inspiring,” Woolery said. “Just a simple act of sharing can be incredibly healing.”
It is this energy to which Rodriguez attributes her motivation to pursue her education at a four-year university. After three semesters at a community college, Rodriguez plans to apply to USC next semester.

Anti-Islam tattoos should be banned in U.S. Military
A recent rise in anti-Islam/Muslim tattoo sub-culture in the U.S. military has stirred debate about its permissibility. Anti-Islam/Muslim tattoos, particularly “infidel” and “kafir,” should be considered racist and extremist, and therefore, prohibited under Army Regulation 670-1.
Military opponents argue that tattoos are the most intense form of self-expression; permanent statements etched into one’s skin, and have no effect on their ability to perform their duties. Though this might be true, it does not change the fact that the U.S. military must uphold an appearance of strict uniformity and the highest standards of behavior, and has no need for tattoos that incite distrust and an image of anti-Islamism in broader populations.
In the works for over a year, strict new rules governing tattoos have been approved by Secretary of the Army John McHugh, and are only awaiting a final signature. Before this policy is signed, anti-Islam/Muslim tattoos should be regarded as racist and extremist and, therefore, prohibited.
Ultimately, this regulation should be extended to all branches of the U.S. military, which all have standards of honor and respect to uphold.
“Infidel” is mistakenly translated by the West as a translation of “kafir;” nevertheless, both terms carry negative associations, most of which are offensive and promote feelings of intolerance in Arab and Muslim populations around the world. Historically in the Qur’an, and more generally, a “kafir” is a disbeliever, someone who rejects the existence of God (Allah) and the Islamic religion. More specifically in Islamic history, a “kafir” was used as a reference for the non-believers in Mecca that actively aimed to bring harm upon the Prophet Mohammed and his followers. In the structure of Islamic thought, “kufr,” the cognate of “kafir,” represents all things unacceptable and offensive to God (Allah). For example, a Muslim can become a “kafir” is they fail to maintain their Islamic duties to Allah.
“Infidel” and “kafir” tattoos have the potential to be regarded by Muslims and Arabs as a blatant expression of an extreme view, and do not serve any constructive purpose to members of the U.S. military. I believe these tattoos are no different and no less offensive than a Nazi swastika is to the Jewish population.
More importantly, what are service members trying to communicate by wearing an Arabic tattoo. After speaking with military members who have the aforementioned tattoos, supporters of the term usually speak in broad generalizations, such as, “That’s what we are to them, infidels. So it’s not like we’re saying anything offensive. It’s just a fact.” The problem is that when people say “them” they are usually referring to “jihadists” or “terrorists,” i.e. more problematic terms. These enthusiasts also seemed to give little thought, or care, as to how their tattoos were perceived by Muslim populations, which leads me to believe getting the tattoos was simply an act of rebellion. Regardless, the Arabic work “kafir” means a number of things to different people, all of which carry varying degrees of intensity. Just like there is no such thing as “one” Islam just as there is no universal Christianity, there is no one way in which the idea behind the term “infidel” or “kafir” is understood or used.
My concern about the prevalence of “kafir” and “infidel” tattoos in the military is simple: I consider it to be a direct form of incitement. Whether service members intend to or not, the tattooed words and images bring about a conflict in religious terms. Even more so, these tattoos are worn to be antagonistic in nature, and not simply factual. Neither of which should be permissible in our military. Both terms are completely wrapped in religion and do not belong in our discourse on war, officially or unofficially, seriously or as a joke.
Beyond how these tattoos are perceived by civilians, what about the 20,000 Muslims that serve in the U.S. military? Or perhaps more importantly, all of the Arab and Muslim service members that work alongside the U.S. military on the ground in other Arab countries? Does the U.S. government want to further its foreign policy objectives in Arab and Muslim nations by military members wearing symbols of what is often perceived as the enemy? The U.S. government is often accused of foreign policy objectives that promote a “War on Islam,” and these tattoos do nothing more than reinforce that generalization. For a country that has invaded two Muslim nations, continues drone strikes in several more and suffers from an extreme deficit of trust with the Muslim population of the world, the United States should take more seriously the appearance standards of its service members.

Please go away. No one values your opinion or respects your views.
It will be interesting to see if this action violates service members’ First Amendment rights.  Courts have already determined that a form of speech does not lose First Amendment protection based on the kind of surface it is applied to, which includes skin…
I agree – that’s part of the defense’s argument. From what I’ve read, when it gets into the military ‘code’ element, soldiers are voluntarily signing up for duty, and consequently, have to conform to the standards of military conduct outlined in the Army Regulations. But, from what I’ve heard, the military used  to pay for tattoo removals, but more recently, it comes out of their own pocket.
It will be interesting to see how it plays out.
Islam is not a race.
If you’re going to use buzz words like ‘racist,’ at least know how.

Among travel fads such as food-centric vacations and eco-tourism, one new trend stands out for its blatant disregard and lack of respect for local residents. Slum travel, or “poorism,” is an alarming and hopefully short-lived travel fad where tourists “play poor” in some of the world’s most poverty-ridden cities. Despite arguments that these tourists boost the local economy, poorism does not solve the issue of poverty. Investors should concentrate on building the local economy, not romanticizing the idea of poverty.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
According to The New York Times, the term “poorism” comes from a combination of the words “poverty” and “tourism.” Tourists seeking “authentic” experiences pay for guided tours of real-life slums or the opportunity to stay in a stylized shantytown. Yet, this voyeuristic fascination with how the other half lives is nothing new.  Even in the late 1800s, people were curious as to how others experienced poverty. Jacob Riis’ book, How the Other Half Lives, provided a portrait of life in the tenement buildings of Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Unlike the current fascination with poverty, this book helped spark social change and encouraged progressive reform.
Unfortunately, this current fascination with poverty does not have such progressive tinged roots. According to United Press International, this poorism trend most likely stems from media’s idealized representation of slums and the widening wealth gap in the United States. The article cites movies and documentaries that present a romanticized view of poverty, such as Slumdog Millionaire and Favela Rising. Additionally, the widening wealth gap in the United States means that the well-to-do rarely come in contact with the impoverished. This growing concentration of wealth, which the Occupy Wall Street movement drew attention to, contributes to this curiosity to experience poverty. The more removed people are from the issue of poverty, the easier it becomes to romanticize the concept.
Investors capitalize on this trend by tailoring tours and hotels to suit tourists’ idea of poverty. The Emoya Luxury Hotel and Spa, in Bloemfontein, South Africa, offers a shantytown for guests who want to play poor for the night. The hotel’s website, seemingly without irony, invites tourists to “[stay] in a Shanty within the safe environment of a private game reserve. This is the only Shanty Town in the world equipped with under-floor heating and wireless internet access!” Yet, this faux-shanty experience is not the worst of the poorism industry.
The Reality Tours and Travel company offers Slum Tours of  Dharavi, India. According to Smithsonian Magazine, Dharavi is the largest slum in Asia, with more than a million people living in tightly packed conditions. The Reality Tour claims its mission is to dispel stereotypes and promote understanding; the tours, however, undeniably depict poverty as a spectacle. As the Times Now panel moderator described in the Smithsonian, slum tourism “is a clear invasion of somebody’s privacy,” and reduces impoverished people to spectacles. As the article later describes, these people have little choice in the matter. They barely have the resources to sustain themselves, let alone prevent outside agencies from arranging slum tours.
This tourism is not confined to so-called “Third World countries.” According to United Press International, Louisiana became a poorism destination following the devastating Hurricane Katrina in 2005. These slum tours routinely take advantage of struggling communities for the benefit of rich tourists. Instead of breaking down barriers between tourists and locals, it encourages outsiders to view the slums as yet another tourist attraction. The people living in real-life poverty become mere actors on a stage. Even though tourists might feel compassion or sympathy for the people they encounter, these slum tours are an inadequate way of truly helping the destitute.
Rather than merely witnessing inequality and poverty, tourists should focus on sustainable tourism that produces lasting, positive impacts on the local community. Though poorism and slum tours undoubtedly generate profit, most of the money flows away from the communities begin exploited.
Even the “green” enterprise of eco-tourism does not provide lasting benefits for locals. In Eco-Tourism: An Ecological and Economic Trap for Third World Countries, author Anita Pleumarom explains that tourism can actually increase a community’s debt burden by creating an economy based solely on tourism. Though tourism encourages areas to improve infrastructure, such as roads, these developments mainly benefit tourists. Pleumarom describes over-reliance on tourism as “a new bubble economy … emerging in villages,” and instead advocates for community-based tourism projects. Poverty alleviation must come from grassroots initiatives, not a dependence on foreign dollars.
In order to make a positive impact, the focus should be on making an area a desirable place to visit, not creating a spectacle from poverty. Poorism neither builds up the local community nor treats impoverished people with respect. This parasitic industry is clearly part of the problem, not the solution. Even though there is no single solution to poverty, microfinance and community-based projects provide a viable option. Microfinance provides small loans to promising enterprises in impoverished communities. These loans allow individuals to build their business and bolster the local economy in a sustainable manner. Furthermore, programs such as World Vision are designed to help a community build the infrastructure it needs to succeed create a local economy. Unlike tourism-based economies, which rely on foreign money, these funds help communities become self-sufficient.
Vacations are an ideal time to experience new cultures, exotic cuisines and breathtaking scenery, but these experiences should not infringe upon the dignity of others. The slum tourists who fail to see the irony in the poorism industry are contributing to the romantic notion of poverty, not helping to alleviate it.
