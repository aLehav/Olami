In front of their first sellout crowd in over five years, the USC Trojans defeated the UCLA Bruins 80-61. Four Trojans scored in double figures, as USC lead from start to finish. The win gave the Trojans their first season sweep over the Bruins since the 2009-10 season.
The Trojans (18-5, 7-3) jumped out to an early 9-0 lead behind some strong play from guard Julian Jacobs. To say the Galen Center was rocking, would have been an understatement.
“It was fun. The fans came out and supported. They went with the blackout,” sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin said. “It was an amazing crowd. Their energy translated to us on the court.
UCLA guard Aaron Holiday kept the Bruins (13-10, 4-6) in the game, scoring 9 first-half points. No other Bruin had more than 6 points in the half.
The Trojans did a great job on the defensive end, holding the Bruins to 30-percent shooting in the first half. The Bruins were able to keep the game from getting out of hand by crashing the offensive glass. Behind center Thomas Welsh, the Bruins had seven first-half offensive rebounds.
Elijah Stewart ended the half on a 11-2 run that put the Trojans up by 11 heading into the locker room. As a team, the Trojans shot 49 percent from the field and hit five 3 pointers in the first half.
The Men of Troy led comfortably for a majority of the second half. Every time the Bruins came within striking distance, the Trojans seemed to have an answer.
After building their lead to as much as 16, the Trojans got lazy on the defensive end and allowed the Bruins to creep back into the game. A 3 pointer from guard Isaac Hamilton cut the Trojan lead to just 6 points.
It didn’t take long for the Trojans to respond. Guard Elijah Stewart came through with a huge 3 on the very next possession to give the Men of Troy a comfortable cushion with just under four minutes to play. Stewart finished with 16 points and six rebounds.
The Bruins missed a 3-point attempt on their next possession, and Bennie Boatwright hit four free throws to push the lead to 13. The Bruins would never threaten again.
The Trojans ended the game on an 18-5 run, capped by a nonchalant 3-pointer from Jordan McLaughlin at the buzzer. McLaughlin had a rough first half, going scoreless, but finished with a team high 10 assists to go with 9 second-half points.
Jacobs continued his stellar season as the heart and soul of the Trojan team. The third-year guard finished with 17 points, six rebounds and five assists.
“It’s definitely huge,” Jacobs said. “But, we expect to win every game that we play. Whether we play defense or not is usually the determining factor. It is definitely nice to see 10,000 at Galen. I can’t remember the last time [that happened].”
UCLA guard Bryce Alford, who has killed the Trojans over the past few years, had one of his worst games of the season. The junior finished 3 for 13 from the field, including 3 for 9 from downtown, with 10 points and seven assists.
Head coach Andy Enfield was satisfied with his team’s defensive lockdown on the dangerous Bruin guard.
“We have pretty good guards too. You’re not going to shut down those guys [Isaac Hamilton and Bryce Alford]. They are so talented, they can make the three, drive, pull-up, and they create for their teammates.” Enfield said. “Our goal was to make it challenging for them because we know how good they are.”
The 61 points marked a season low for the Bruins, who entered the game averaging 80.1 points per game. As a team, the Bruins could not find their offense against a stout Trojan defense. UCLA finished shooting just 35 percent from the field and 27 percent from deep.
The win gave the Trojans their best-ever home record to start the season at 14-0.
Next up for the Men of Troy is a trip to Arizona to take on the Sun Devils and Wildcats. The Trojans beat both teams at the Galen Center in early January.

Yearning for another championship, women’s water polo prepares for their first competitive preseason game Friday against the UC San Diego Tritons before traveling to Whittier on Saturday. The weekend will begin the Women of Troy’s campaign to the MPSF and NCAA playoffs.
The No. 19 Tritons have garnered a 3-1 preseason record beating Azusa Pacific 15-7, CSUN 10-9 and CSU Bakersfield 9-7 while falling to UC Santa Barbara 9-10. Senior 2-meter defender Alexis Wieseler has already paved her way as the preseason leading scorer for the Tritons with 13 goals in 4 games while goalie Courtney Miller has racked up 38 saves thus far in preseason play.
Returning for his 22nd consecutive season, Coach Vavic and the Women of Troy expect to make a splash in the preseason and MPSF play on their campaign for a thirteenth straight trip to the NCAA Tournament. With seven members having played at the national level in both the FINA World Championship and the FINA Junior World Championship, the Women of Troy have proven to be a highly skilled team to be reckoned with.
Looking into the roster, the Trojans boast a deep defensive line-up with six outstanding goalies, including sophomore Victória Chamorro who had an outstanding freshman season with 207 saves and All-MPSF honors. Making her debut season with the Trojans, Amanda Longan is expected to bring extra fire to the cage with an already impressive track record, having received the Top Goalkeeper award at the 2015 FINA Junior World Championship.
Opponents of the Trojans face double trouble on offense from the Haralabidis sisters, Ioanna and Stephania who shared a total of 114 goals last season, and Canadian sophomore Hayley McKelvey who represented Canada in the 2012 and 2014 FINA Youth World Championships as well as the 2015 FINA Junior World Championship.
“Our main goal is to be the best defensive team in the league,” sophomore captain driver Brianna Daboub said. “Ultimately, we’d like to take down No. 1 Stanford and be NCAA champions.”
The Women of Troy are confident in their younger squad and believe they have a special chemistry that will ultimately set them apart from the competition and lead them to the playoffs.
“Though we did lose some key players, we have a younger talented team and we are very close, so we’re working to play as a unit in the pool and stay strong on defense,” senior driver Melissa Bergesen said.
The season opener against the Tritons will begin at 5 p.m. at the Uytengsu Aquatic Center.

For all but one year of my pre-collegiate life, I lived in a quiet suburban city in the Bay Area called Santa Clara, located a bit north of San Jose and an hour south of San Francisco.
In fact, here’s where I tell people I’m from — because nobody understands the multitude of Bay Area cities, and anyone from the region can relate: “You know San Francisco? Yeah, I live there, but like, an hour away.”
I won’t have to say that anymore after this weekend, when the world’s attention descends upon my nondescript hometown for Super Bowl 50 at Levi’s Stadium, just six miles and a 15-minute drive from where I live.
It feels very strange for my city to be hosting the grandest and most prestigious sporting event in America, and I use the word “strange” because I have mixed feelings about it.
Santa Clara is not a sports town. It is not a town meant to have thousands of people streaming in for a major event, let alone a Super Bowl. Santa Clara is a classic suburb, consisting mainly of shopping plazas and office buildings, with little to no attractions or nightlife. In the midst of Silicon Valley, the city is right next to tech giants such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Yahoo! and Intel – in other words, its main occupants are middle-aged engineers and techies living a middle-class lifestyle.
Somehow, the San Francisco 49ers decided this would be the right place to build a new $1.3 billion stadium – $114 million of which came from taxpayer money – and move San Francisco’s team 40 miles away. It might as well be a world away, comparing the atmosphere of one of the world’s most iconic cities to a small suburban town. The Oakland Raiders, just a trek across the Bay Bridge away in the O.co Coliseum, are located closer to San Francisco than the 49ers.
Since construction began on the stadium in 2012, I’ve watched firsthand as it was built, piece-by-piece, slowly taking on the form of a colossal, 70,000-seat venue. Infrastructure-wise, I have to admit it is as state-of-the-art as stadiums come. But something about it feels off – perhaps the way it panders to a corporate ideal. Sponsors are everywhere, including – and definitely not limited to – the Intel Gate, the Dignity Health Gate, the Toyota Gate, the SAP Tower, the Visa Box Office, the Pepsi Fan Deck, the Bud Light Patio and the Safeway Faithful Mile (fancy words for “tailgate area”). If a company asked to sponsor the restrooms, the 49ers would approve in a heartbeat. Celebrity chef Michael Mina has a Bourbon Steak restaurant in the stadium, and if you’re asking yourself who would go to a football game to eat a $95 steak, you’re not the only one.
The immediate area has been affected as well. Right across the street is the Santa Clara Golf & Tennis Club, where, as a kid, I used to play tennis with my father on Sunday afternoons. That’s no longer an option. Adjacent to the stadium sits the Santa Clara Youth Soccer Park, home to 1,500 kids in the Santa Clara Youth Soccer League. Their website reads, “All fields: closed until further notice for Super Bowl 50” because the NFL has taken over and is turning the fields into a “media village” for the Super Bowl. A superior court judge denied a lawsuit by the soccer league, leaving the conditions of the artificial turf in danger and thousands of kids without a place to play.
“The [Super Bowl] is big and cool, but it is also a really big downfall because we don’t have somewhere to practice,” Monica Hrncir, a 15-year-old soccer player, told USA Today. “They’ve had so much stuff there and the fields are totally trashed. It is pretty disappointing.”
This is the pinnacle of corporate culture imposing its will on everyday citizens and why I am extremely lukewarm about the Super Bowl coming to town. The Super Bowl is not “big and cool” if you’re a youth soccer player looking to get to practice, or if you just happen to live nearby and have to cancel your plans on Sunday.
And Santa Clara is not the only city affected by the Super Bowl. The majority of events this week leading up to the game are taking place in San Francisco, which will cost taxpayers approximately $5 million, and it doesn’t even have the benefit of hosting the actual game. The NFL put up a number of obnoxious “50” signs all over the city, and to retaliate, people are gleefully vandalizing them. In one location, the sign was tipped over with the lettering on it brilliantly rearranged from “Super Bowl 50” to “oops.”
While I can’t lie that I’m not happy for my city hosting the Super Bowl, the bragging rights are far outweighed by the maddening corporate culture that will be made worse by the event. And so I hope something happens on Sunday — however big or small — that sends a negative message. Perhaps some people think the game is in San Francisco, spend hours stuck in traffic driving an hour south and miss the game entirely. Maybe another power outage disrupts the game, which would be an embarrassment for this state-of-the-art stadium with seemingly more sponsorships than there are residents in Santa Clara. Whatever happens, I believe turning my once-quiet suburban hometown into the center of the world on Sunday is doing more harm than good.

This weekend the men’s volleyball team have a pair of matches on the road, first on Friday at No. 11 UC Irvine and then on Saturday at UC San Diego.
It’s fair to say that neither the Trojans’ nor the Anteaters’ seasons have begun as expected. Before MPSF play, USC (1-7, 1-5 MPSF) was ranked 12th in the nation, and UC Irvine (2-6, 1-5) fourth. Yet on Friday, the two teams are facing off to avoid the bottom of the league and perhaps keep playoff hopes alive.
Friday night’s matchup at the Bren Center means a great deal for the Trojan’s playoff push.
The season is still young. In fact, USC is still trying to figure out its starting lineup.
“Every game, we always get some adjustments here or there,” sophomore opposite Jon Rivera said. “I don’t think we’ve played a game where we’ve stuck with the same lineup.”
Many of the inconsistencies in the Trojans’ lineup can be chalked up to injuries.
At the setter position, junior Michael Mullahey remains sidelined with a knee injury, while Lewis University-transfer sophomore Gert Lisha has played only one match since recovering from a hand injury. For now, Lisha and fellow sophomore Jack Yoder are competing for the job.
“I expect [Lisha] to compete for the role,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “Just like anyone else, I don’t believe in just giving it to a person because that doesn’t teach them anything about being a good volleyball player.”
Lisha brings much experience to the court. Last year, he appeared in 26 matches for a Lewis team that lost in the NCAA finals. In 2013, he played internationally with his native Albania.
At outside hitter, the Trojans are bouncing between juniors Christopher Orenic and Lucas Yoder.
The 2016 position seems to remain up for grabs, as they both have sputtered out of the gates. Orenic is hitting .143, and Lucas Yoder is not much better at .191.
At opposite, at least, it seems that the Trojans have found a rising star. Jon Rivera has started every game this year and last week had a career-high 23 kills versus Pepperdine, which he followed up with a strong 13-kill, five-dig performance against Stanford.
The Men of Troy have been one of the worst blocking teams in the MPSF this year totaling 55.0 blocks while allowing 101.0 to opponents.
Whereas the Trojans’ poor start can be traced to injury and youth, the Anteaters returned five starters from last year’s MPSF Tournament-winning team — Tamir Hershko, Kyle Russell, Jason Agopian, Andrew Benz and Michael Saeta.
Two of those veterans, senior middle blocker Jason Agopian and junior opposite Tamir Hershko, made the 2015 First-Team All-MPSF.
This year, the two continue to put up staggering numbers, which makes UC Irvine’s slow start all the more perplexing. Hershko leads the team with 4.07 kills/set and hits .302, and Agopian tags on an additional 1.81 kills/set with a .436 hitting percentage.
On Saturday, the Trojans take on a UC San Diego (3-7, 0-4) team that has not won in MPSF play since 2014 when it went 2-22. Junior outside hitter Ian Colbert recorded back-to-back double-doubles for the Tritons last week and then in a third match versus No. 5 Hawaii matched a career-high 19 kills.
Aside from Colbert’s individual performance last week, the Tritons have attacked poorly. As a team, they are hitting .198 for the season. Sophomore opposite Tanner Syftestad, who is second on the team with 65 kills, has also committed 45 errors and is hitting .112.

The Undergraduate Student Government presidential and vice presidential candidates debated issues of diversity Thursday night. The two tickets, the first comprised of Program Board Finance Director Edwin Saucedo and USG Director of University Affairs Austin Dunn and the second of Senatorial Aide Charlie Henriquez and Resident Student Government Vice President of Programming Cole Pham debated on the challenges that minority groups face on campus.
The candidates tackled issues of racism, sexism, equality and the promotion of an inclusive campus where students of all backgrounds can feel welcome and safe. The hour-long debate, moderated by USG Director of Diversity Affairs Moira Turner, provided a platform for the candidates to address diversity concerns that many students consider among their chief concerns at USC.
Turner opened the debate by asking the candidates what they believed diversity entailed. All four candidates expressed similar views; diversity entails the different ways an individual expresses him or herself and the necessity of having safe spaces for people of all backgrounds and creeds to feel safe.
“While we often hear statistics about USC being one of the most diverse college campuses in the nation, the statistics are irrelevant if students themselves don’t feel welcome or represented,” Dunn said. “We’re trying to reach as much of our student population as possible.”
Questions were submitted from various minority groups on campus such as the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, who asked candidates about what they believed to be the most pressing issues faced by Asian Americans on campus. Saucedo, who was the first Latino intern at the Center for Asian Americans United for Self Empowerment, stated that a major issue for the community was the problem of being the “model minority.”
“Many people lump Asian Americans together and regard them as the model minority,” Saucedo said. “People frequently make assumptions and falsely group all Asians together.”
Henriquez similarly stated that the stereotypical views people often glaze over all Asian Americans is a major problem which must be addressed at USC.
“A lot of Asian Americans don’t speak their ancestors’ languages, and a lot of times, people see these individuals as coming from a collective center,” Henriquez said. “We want to go out and start these programs and initiatives to celebrate different cultures, as a lot of festivities go on in the Asian culture.”
The Latina/o Student Assembly questioned the candidates on their opinion of issues of the Latino community, raising concerns over previous candidates presenting false promises with little accountability. Pham said that a mobile application to use as a resource would be beneficial in this area.
“A mobile application would be a resource for not only the Latino community, but for anyone who is looking for resources in general,” Pham said. “It would be a one-click place, and they wouldn’t have to go out and search for resources; they would just be in the palm of their hand.”
Another issue raised during the debate by Women’s Student Assembly was that of sexual assault and gender harm. All four candidates had very strong opinions on the matter, promising to strengthen USC’s policies regarding sexual violence.
“We must change our sexual assault response time, making sure the timeline is between four to six weeks, rather than six to nine months, which it currently is,” Saucedo said.
The International Students Assembly questioned each candidate on their goals for serving the international student population and how they will go about actualizing them. Saucedo said that the resources international students have available need to help them acclimate to life in the United States better.
“The international student resources on campus are complete crap,” Saucedo said. “Yes, we now have an actual resource center on campus, but that doesn’t mean it serves  students beyond doing visas and paperwork, so we must expand our resources and help students adapt to a different culture.”
A question proposed by the Black Student Assembly asked the candidates what kinds of experiences they had working with others from different backgrounds than their own. Henriquez said that he has worked with a diverse student body through his on-campus involvement.
“Joining different organizations have given me the experiences of working with people of different backgrounds, and I’ve learned to never assume and not judge but to let things flow naturally,” Henriquez said.

In an effort to modernize degree programs for a changing industry, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism unveiled a revised undergraduate degree, the Bachelor of Arts in journalism, Thursday. After undergoing the University’s review process, the new degree program will likely go into effect for the Fall 2016 semester.
In an email sent to current Annenberg students, Willow Bay, director of the Annenberg School of Journalism, said, “USC Annenberg’s B.A. in journalism will prepare our students to build rewarding careers, thrive in contemporary newsrooms and lead the industry in an exciting time of rapid change.”
While the school currently offers two undergraduate journalism degrees — either broadcast and digital journalism or print and digital journalism — the new journalism B.A. program eliminates the distinction. The change, according to Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Gordon Stables, is meant to create a curriculum that was flexible  as journalism changes over time and as students develop their specific interests. Beginning in their junior year, students in the new degree program will have the option to choose an area of emphasis in print journalism and sports journalism, among others.
“I think the best way to describe the goals of the new curriculum was to allow it to be forward-looking so that as things change in technology, in journalism and in related industries the curriculum has the flexibility to keep those current in what they’re doing,” Stables said.
Nick Ring, a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, pointed out that the new combined journalism program could enable students to explore the industry in a way that’s not currently possible.
“I think that the new approach that they’re going with will just make it more accessible, and students won’t feel as tied down to one side of the field, and they’ll have more of an opportunity to explore what areas they like the most,” Ring said.
Students in the current journalism degree programs, depending on their class status, can blend the new course offerings into their degrees as electives or transition entirely to the new journalism B.A. degree. Stables said that courses with the same number that are included in both degree programs will count toward major credit for both despite slight tweaks to the course names and content.
Heeding input from faculty in the journalism school, the new undergraduate program includes dedicated classes for data journalism, programming  and visual storytelling — areas that were optional at best in the old degrees. Courses that emphasize digital-specific ethics and civic engagement are also new additions.
Max Schwartz, a senior in the current broadcast journalism program with a position as news editor at Annenberg Media, felt that the new degree program’s emphasis on digital skills was prudent.
“I think it will only be beneficial as we move more digital, as most content is now on online platforms, and as more employers look for that skill,” Schwartz said. “It’s definitely great, and I’m glad that the school is moving forward on that front … because they want to stay the best and [be] competitive.”
The new digital emphasis was also inspired by the technological capabilities of the media center in Wallis Annenberg Hall, where different forms of journalism converge in one space.
“The phrase ‘inspiration’ is 100 percent correct. The curriculum couldn’t have been developed without the time with the faculty and students working in [the new media center]. Building [Wallis Annenberg Hall] was really re-developing the culture of journalism education here,” Stables said.

The USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics works with a variety of student organizations to increase political engagement, and this semester the institute is unveiling a new set of programs geared toward student minorities having their voices heard.
These programs include partnering with student-run organizations such as the Latina/o Student Assembly, Black Student Assembly and Asian Pacific American Student Assembly. Partnerships and outreach will not only give attention to people who live in the community outside of USC, but an opportunity for them to express issues that lie within minority communities.
Erika Maldonado, the programs associate at Unruh, says the institute’s goal is to get a more diverse demographic of students involved in politics and Unruh programming.
“We like to partner with different cultural assemblies on campus; we partner with them, but we also have a political spin on things,” Maldonado said. “This semester, we are working with the [Latina/o] Student Assembly, Black Student Assembly and APASA. One of the programs we are launching is diversity in politics, and it’s getting all types of people, not just politically inclined students, to be involved in politics.”
Ali Bissonnette, deputy director of the Unruh Institute, said that the diversity program hopes to expand the amount of people involved with the Unruh Institute.
“Our programming switched this semester,” Bissonnette said. “We used to work frequently with certain groups, and we always see the same faces. Now, our goal is to get all student organizations involved in politics. We don’t believe millennials not wanting to get involved in politics. We see so many young students wanting to help their community.”
Unruh has also created the Civic Engagement Teaching Internship, which informs high school students about the process of getting involved with their community.
“The Civic Engagement Teaching Internship is where we go out to our local community classrooms and talk to students asking them what they see in their community and how voting can actually help alleviate some of those issues,” Bissonnette said.  “What we see is both high school and college students  [who] want to volunteer and take part in making their community a better place.”
Tania Mercado, the director of government affairs for Unruh, spoke about opportunities for young students to get involved in politics.
“Every semester, we take a group of students up to Sacramento where they have the opportunity to talk to representatives, government staffs and journalists, which help students get involved in politics,” she said.
Dan Schnur, Director of the Unruh Institute, says that the program is coming on the heels of a greater national trend of minority involvement in politics.
“There is no question that we’ve seen a dramatic increase of students from the minority communities getting involved in government and politics,” Schnur said.

Getting a crowd for a student production is a lot like getting an A in Writing 150 — it doesn’t happen very often. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed toward the myriad of performances happening on campus every month. Every so often, a play will fall into the laps of the audience members sitting in the Massman Theatre. The Secret in the Wings, which premiered Thursday, is an extraordinary production put on by the Aeneid Theatre Company and director Burt Chaikin, a senior majoring in cinematic arts and critical studies. The surrealist play winds between dark Grimm fairy tales, landing on the heart strings of anyone who has ever had an imagination. The nonlinear story is bolstered by the skill and craft of a talented cast. Their performances impress with their nuances and complete enthrallment in the role. The original score cannot go unnoticed, as it holds every piece together. Chaikin’s bigger-than-life vision fuels the play with energy and vivacious character that seems to be hard to find in student productions these days. The Daily Trojan got to sit down with Chaikin to discuss the miraculous story of the play that almost wasn’t.   
Daily Trojan: Tell us a little bit about the process in producing this show.
Burt Chaikin: We were originally supposed to do a different show. The Aeneid Theatre Company started [in 2014] on campus, and the founders decided that there weren’t enough outlets for students to put on shows: student produced, driven and run shows.  What happened was I had pitched a show, actually one of my favorites; there was a lot of excitement. It was a well-known show that had generated a lot of recognition, because it’s a show not often done on college campuses. The problem was that in trying to do a show at the Massman, you apply to perform a show there, but you don’t find out the dates until November. I couldn’t apply for the rights to the show until we knew the dates for the show. You see the issue. We had to audition and prep the show without knowing the dates and without any rights. Shortly after we had begun the contract to secure our rights, someone came and bought out the rights to the show in Southern Los Angeles until July.
DT: What was that like?
BC: We spent the entire day trying to find a solution: calling the publishing company, calling people’s agents. As a director, I figured this was a problem that would eventually be solved, and then we’ll move on to the new one. There really wasn’t a solution. I had to go into the first read through and tell the actors and crew the show wasn’t happening. It was a really hard day.
DT: How did you find a new show to do?
BC: I skipped class one day and read at least 22—25 shows that people had sent me. I noticed, though, that the shows I was reading were very similar to the other show in terms of style, naturalism and content. I couldn’t do it. That night, I went to the library and picked my favorite shows. I wanted to keep trying. I was scared, because I didn’t want such a big part of my senior year to be taken away. The Secret in the Wings was the last play in my pile that night in the library. It’s a show by Mary Zimmerman. What I loved was how different it was from the play I was planning on doing.
DT: What should someone expect from The Secret in the Wings?
BC: It’s very dreamlike, fragmented, and it doesn’t always make sense. The show runs parallel to life. For me, the show is about what we fear and why — that we don’t need to be scared. As children, we are scared of so many things. Yet somehow, our adult selves are even more scared than our childhood spirits. Zimmerman invites us to bring back our childhood spirits, and that we don’t need to be as terrified as we are. We can choose love, beauty and courage over that fear. The show is very special.
The Secret in the Wings runs Friday at 7 p.m. and 11 p.m.; Saturday at 2:30 p.m. and 8 p.m.; and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. All performances are in the Massman Theatre.

Undergraduate Student Government orchestrated some of the most transformative and public initiatives in USC’s history over the past year. The University was at the epicenter of a highly visible discussion about diversity and inclusion, propelling the passage of the campus climate resolution. Sustainability 2020 provided the University’s first comprehensive proposal to tackle waste on campus and implement sustainable policy. And from these issues came some of the highest student engagement and activism that we’ve ever seen on this campus.
But some campus issues still demand attention. Commuter, transfer and spring admit students are still left out of crucial aspects of our Trojan Family. Tuition hikes threaten college affordability, and tuition conversations lack transparency. Students continue to find themselves on multiple-week-long waiting lists in order to talk to mental health professionals.
But USG presidential and vice presidential candidates Edwin Saucedo and Austin Dunn can seize the momentum that has manifested this year. Though both tickets for the USG presidency have served the student body, Saucedo and Dunn come with considerably more valuable experience. As Finance Director of USG, Saucedo oversaw a $1.3 million budget and exercised judgment to allocate funds, requiring close collaboration among student leaders that will shape relationships during a USG presidency. Dunn, as director of University Affairs, has mediated conversations between different factions of campus wellness. Compared to the other presidential ticket, Charlie Henriquez and Cole Pham, Saucedo and Dunn understand the inner workings of USG and can effectively lead the student body on a grander scale.
On sexual assault, both tickets advocate for a shorter response time and more effective prevention. Henriquez and Pham have brought up the point that the University Park Campus lacks a medical examiner. However, Saucedo and Dunn identified a more precise framework to achieve tangible results — focusing more specifically on decreasing response time for Title IX investigations.
On the issue of sustainability, however, Henriquez and Pham’s proposals more aggressively pursue goals to make campus greener. The platform has more innovative and concrete proposals — to decrease water consumption and implement more solar power. Both hope to increase sustainability projects at the University. Regardless, the upcoming presidency should work closely to hold the administration accountable for the recently passed Sustainability 2020 resolution, and it’s important for leaders to know the details of this important proposal.
All the candidates recognize greek life as an integral part of the Trojan experience. Nevertheless, Saucedo and Dunn admit that aspects of greek life are isolating and want to extend participation past Interfraternity Council and PanHellenic Council — greater incorporating multicultural greek councils in the fabric of greek life. Expanding the diversity conversation to all greek councils on campus is a smart approach to work to improve the inclusiveness of greek life, rather than remaining blind to the issues that persist within it.
To promote a more congruent campus life, both tickets are working with underrepresented student populations. As far as initiatives that cater to the support of the commuter, spring admit and transfer student body, the candidates realize the need for an increased number of festivities celebrating the integration of these students into the traditional USC experience. Saucedo and Dunn take these initiatives a step further with their proposed installation of commuter lounges and lockers to alleviate the pressures of commuting to school.
Following a year of unprecedented diversity advocacy, it is the responsibility for the next presidency to continue these conversations. Both platforms support expanding cultural resource centers, an important pillar to connecting students with community. And though the Henriquez-Pham platform puts forth commendable effort, for example in its advocacy for student leader inclusion training, the idea that a mobile application to connect students and resource centers could actually improve campus climate is out of touch with — and frankly insulting to — legitimate efforts for inclusion. On the other hand, diversity proposals of Saucedo and Dunn have a sharp focus — advocating for counselors within resource centers.
Knowing the value of student voices from USC’s multi-faceted population, Edwin-Austin seeks to collaborate with as many people as possible through personal interactions. They understand the current opaqueness of USG’s budget and seek to better support different student organizations by rerouting personal finances, such as retreat funds, to promote better programs. They also aim to come to the students as well, with greater availability for office hours. By making USG an integrative experience, Edwin-Austin take what worked in the Rini Sampath-Jordan Fowler administration and make it better.
Both tickets, however, seem to gloss over the issues of college affordability and mental health. Saucedo and Dunn’s affordability initiatives are small-scale but concrete — include improving USG budgeting, free laundry services and extending dining hall hours during breaks. Henriquez and Pham hope to advocate for a tuition freeze, but it’s unclear how they believe they will succeed in this advocacy when the Rini-Jordan administration has failed. However, both platforms should push not for an unrealistic tuition freeze but for greater tuition transparency  — the first step to understanding why tuition is so high is understanding where it goes. Moreover, neither platform website even mentions the term “mental health,” let alone gives this issue the weight it deserves.
The past year has been a year of unprecedented progress for USG, and much of that has been symbolized by the advocacy of Sampath and Fowler — the first president and vice president duo that were both women, and women of color. As a first-generation college student, Saucedo continues to personify the kind of barrier-breaking that USG — and USC — is known for.
Edwin-Austin is the best ticket to represent student voices and continue the advocacy of the past semester. They bring extensive experience in USG as well as an achievable plan to address the pressing issues facing the student body.

Very few things in life are purely objective. And yet, college students find themselves buying into the facade of infallibility presented by U.S. News and World Report’s hailed Best Colleges ranking system. And for another truism: almost nothing is apolitical. The Very Important College List is no exception.
Like reality television, rankings are supposed to appear observational and objective — but, similar to Keeping up with the Kardashians, orchestrating factors lurk in the background; those factors are naturally tied to and influence the administrative nucleus within the world of higher education. The U.S. News rankings are not an objective judgment of academic caliber; rather, they are the result of varying political influences that are aware of each other and operate synchronously.
Thus, the wheel turns: Mostly wealthy students from the American elite attend selective universities, ascending to positions of power, sometimes within academia. They then either support the ranking system directly — through all-too-influential peer evaluation — or indirectly by preserving institutional bias toward prestigious universities. These universities increase tuition, which does not affect on the wealthy elite who attend, and spend more money, increasing rankings, which boosts application numbers and lowers admissions rates. And the cycle repeats itself.
“Peer evaluation,” the first determining factor, asks university presidents to rank other universities, perpetuating prejudice within the politics of the academic elite. The reputation of Harvard, for example, has no bearing on the education a Harvard student will receive or how that education might compare to a Caltech student’s education. But its reputation — based on the opinions of people who come from elite institutions — does have significant bearing on the published ranking.
Distinguished institutions tend to recruit from the elite and produce the elite, who end up in positions of academic power and expand institutional influence. Considering that nearly 40 Harvard alumni are also university presidents, it’s clear that the elite turns right around to reinforce its own importance.
Another determining criterion is the selectivity of the admissions rate, a statistic almost as easy to believe as it is to manipulate. By the calculations of U.S. News, a school with lower admissions rates will receive a higher ranking — even if applicants are not well-qualified.
The last and most unfortunate factor is university spending on programs. Spending more money on university programs increases institutional ranking, which results in higher application numbers — decreasing the admissions rate and eventually improving university ranking. Enjoy and repeat. The funding to get the ball rolling can easily emerge from tuition increases. So, if you attend a top-ranked university, you might as well slap on that bumper sticker — after all, you paid for it.
The game doesn’t end with U.S. News and its magic calculator. Although students may not be aware of ranking politics, universities are not, and continue to manipulate rankings.
One of the easiest ways universities move up is simply spending more money. For private institutions, this is fairly easy. Start fundraising. Dip into your endowment. Raise tuition. USC is a prime example: President C. L. Max Nikias is working toward the administration’s $6 billion endowment goal. As the Los Angeles Times’ Larry Gordon stated last spring, “In two decades, [USC] has climbed from 51st to 25th in U.S. News’ rankings of national universities. Behind that success is an elaborate and powerful fundraising machine.”
Universities also influence rankings by increasing applicant pools simply to turn away more students. The spring admissions policy caters exactly to this need — spring admits are not considered part of the “entering class,” and thus, universities can enroll the desired amount of students for an even more attractive admissions rate.
Or, instead of only tangentially misrepresenting information, colleges could just cheat, like Claremont McKenna College, who falsified test scores of their admits for years on end. Finally, some schools simply refuse to participate, like Reed College.
To add insult to injury, cultural pressure surrounding university admissions encourages students to preserve the ranking system. Students at elite institutions are incentivized to support them to boost the value of their degree through the name brand of their university.
The rankings peddled by U.S. News should be viewed not as the sole reflection of academic success, but rather as their academic power paired with the university’s success in gerrymandering rankings. When the next Best Colleges list arrives, this column won’t be the only thing playing politics.
Lily Vaughan is a freshman majoring in history and political science. Her column, “Playing Politics,” runs  Fridays.
What is objective?…..I think it’s more determined by how successful a university’s alumni are. What kind of careers do they do? How do they contribute to society in positive ways? How are these alumni extraordinary?

USC has inspired and created some of the most influential artists in today’s music industry. From Grammy Award-winning legend Herb Alpert to alternative pop songstress Banks, the University has made a profound influence on the success of many artists, composers and industry executives all around the world.
In collaboration with the Undergraduate Student Government Program Board, Samsung has decided to bring its new Level Music Lab program to the USC campus. The Lab, started in late 2015, has been bringing interactive musical experiences to college campuses across the nation. The Lab will invite Trojans to experience music like never before with the newest pop star in the industry, Halsey. The pop singer rose to fame through the release of her single “Ghost” and has recently garnered more attention following her collaboration with Justin Bieber on “The Feeling.”
The Lab has allowed students across the country to learn more about artists, At the event, Halsey will open up her world to the audience and allow them to discover the inspiration behind her debut album Badlands, as well as the musical influences in her career. The audience will develop some special insight about how the “New Americana” singer made it big after years of posting song covers on YouTube.
Inspired by Samsung LEVEL, a new line of premium audio headphones, the program hopes to provide aspiring artists and music fans with an opportunity to access new technologies and learn about creating music with some of the top performers in the industry. Students attending this intimate event will not only get to hear Halsey’s top hits but will also have the chance to speak with her about the songwriting process and the technicalities of music production.
In the past, the USG Concerts Committee has worked diligently to bring some of the top music acts in the world to perform for the student body. Musicians such as Miguel, Cashmere Cat and Walk the Moon have all had the opportunity to perform in McCarthy Quad for Welcome Week and Conquest events. However, Halsey’s appearance at USC will be unparalleled to any performance that students have seen.
The Samsung Level Music Lab with Halsey will take place at 3 p.m. Friday at Tommy’s Place.

The song “Lost in the Supermarket” rolls into “Guns of Brixton” until “Koka Kola” pours from the speakers and lands on “The Card Cheat.” Rock ‘n’ roll had proved itself a major player for a couple decades when The Clash rolled in and switched it up. From somber, standard rock hits to funked up grooves, reggae inspired tunes and punk infused vibes, The Clash was the first band that taught me genres could be suggestions rather than confinements. While its original run ended in the mid-’80s, it was only the beginning in my personal journey with genre melding.
Chris Stapleton and Justin Timberlake made headlines with their award show collaboration. The world watched and made many a click-bait article, as Taylor Swift went from young country up-and-comer to global pop sensation. Fans waited with baited breath for Fall Out Boy’s re-release featuring prominent rappers on every song. The music industry and its consumers are fascinated time and time again when stars dip their toes in other genres. But do genres only collide when promotions or one-off collaborations occur? We’re all aware of bands who mix indie rock and indie pop or rap and soul, but genres don’t have to be of kin to find themselves intermixed.
AWOLNATION climbed the charts back in 2012 with “Sail,” but the band, fronted by Aaron Bruno, is a prime example of not subscribing to one genre. While its songs have a coherency provided by a trademark style, they branch out into hip-hop, rock, alternative, dubstep, electropop and more. Every song is not a composite of a multitude of genres but rather has multiple influences that feed into an overall song not completely pinned down by one label or another. Bruno’s vocals can transform from ’80s synth accompaniment to digitally distorted metal and pop pronunciation to rock band frontman and even scream to robotic. “Knights of Shame” is a 12-minute song that feels like a timeless complexity. The song uses similar chord progressions through a minefield of genre influences. It’s not something you can pinpoint the exact moment of change within but rather an evolution you ride out.
An artist who has been incredibly outspoken about the importance of genre melding is Raury. The 19-year-old musician creates songs that come across as art more than the conventional notion of music. Play his most popular songs on Spotify in order, and you’ll be convinced it’s not the same artist each time. In individual songs, he can combine gospel, soul and rap or folk, rock and hip-hop. Over entire albums, he creates an articulate feeling through folk, indie, pop, electro, rap, rock and more. Raury becomes a curator within a world of intricacies while managing to avoid getting lost. Raury has created a presence, an identity, a moment and a message that results in genre melding rather than the other way around.
Gorillaz shaped their dark, brooding sound with electronic-, pop-, indie- and rock-sculpted songs. Cake used the instruments and styles of jazz, the vocals of a monotone speaking voice and the body of alternative rock. Caravan Palace mixes electronic music with 1920’s swing to create the perfect soundtrack to a hipster rave. As electronic techniques integrate further into music, artists find genre melding easier and easier. New genres based around technological developments arise every year as DJs use sampling and features to produce multi-branded beats. The future of music is at the pinnacle of possibility, ready to parallel society in a progressive move towards seeing genre as non-defining. Artists like Raury represent a new generation interested in letting the music speak for itself rather than being marketed to pre-decided demographics. And I, for one, can’t wait.

Happy Chinese New Year! In honor of the new Lunar Year on Feb. 8, here’s a list of Chinese songs for Trojans to ring in the Year of the Monkey.The words are in a different language, but music is all about connection. 
This playlist is dedicated to my Chinese professors I have had the pleasure of learning from at USC. Without them, I wouldn’t have come to understand the beauty of the Chinese language. As someone who was not really interested in learning it, I now see the benefit of learning a second language. Learning Chinese gave me the chance to not only speak with my parents in their native tongue but also understand where my family lies in the heart of cultural history.
I want to start the playlist with an American-born Chinese musician. Wang Leehom was born in Rochester, New York and studied at Berklee College of Music. As a Chinese-American myself, I gained the confidence to learn Chinese as a second language through his music. His songs helped me understand and experience the beauty of music across different languages. 
“Sun Washed By Spring Rain” tells a story of the seasons. Winter is full of sadness, but as the cloud clears up, a new beginning (spring) will keep you up in spirits. The moral of the story is no matter how sad you’ll feel, your emotions will change just like the seasons.
This song is a reminder to thank your mom for the red envelopes she gives you. It’s dedicated to all the hardworking mothers out there.
Another one of Chou’s songs, “Hair Like Snow” from the direct translation of 髮如雪 (fa ru xue). The song uses traditional Chinese instruments such as a gu zheng (古箏), which is used to carry the main melody.
There are many different Chinese dialects, but Mandarin and Cantonese are used most in conversations. Most of the music I have on this playlist consists of Mandarin songs, but Justin Lo is the one exception. He’s well-known in Hong Kong, and I hope this upbeat song will showcase the beauty of a unique dialect.
5. Jay Chou 周杰倫 – 退后 “Retreat”

More of a slow, romantic song, “退后” (tui hou) direct translates to stepping back.  The rough English translation is “Retreat,” which I personally think is a better title for the song. The song tells the story of a someone the singer does not keep in touch with anymore. In one line, he mentions “our past has been forgotten as time goes by,” which serves as a reminder of memorable times we have all shared with a loved one. I suggest spending time with the people you love this New Year’s. 
“Retreat” to a place where there is peace and quiet because the people you love are the people who are important in your life. After all, once they’re gone from this world or if relationships die within time, stepping back and taking in the present is the most gifted thing the world has to offer.
6. David Tao – 天天 “Every Day” 
In this number expresses, the singer can’t stop thinking about the girl he likes no matter where he goes. At some point in our lives, we hopefully have or will have experienced someone we can’t stop thinking about. To relate it back to the (Chinese) New Year, start your resolution today and ask that person out!
We all know Yo-Yo Ma as one of the most talented cellist of our time, but he should also be lauded for bridging the gap between Western and Eastern cultures through music. If you’d also like to take a walk down memory lane back to the renowned musician’s early days, check out this video, which features Leonard Bernstein, the creator of West Side Story, introducing a young Yo-Yo Ma and his sister, Yeou-Cheng Ma. 
Not only is Jackie Chan a master of karate, but he is also has a talent in singing. 國家 (guo jia) tells of an undying love for one’s country, and as we celebrate the Lunar New Year with moon cakes, hot pot and red envelopes, remember to give thanks to whatever country we live in. This new year isn’t just about a certain country’s celebration but one for all cultures of the world to spend time with their families. As someone who celebrates Chinese New Year, I’m excited to mark the start another great year with my diverse Trojan family.

★★★★☆
Once again, I have found a donut shop that is open 24 hours, and through my experiences, I have found that they are just as delicious at every hour of the day. You never know when a donut craving will strike, and a donut craving is not something you can simply ignore. Lucky for USC students, Spudnuts Donuts on Figueroa has been a go-to location for a treat after a long night of shenanigans. For the purpose of this review, however, I visited Spudnuts during the day, so that I could choose from the full selection of donuts while they were still fresh.
There’s nothing necessarily gourmet about these donuts, but after trying several artsy donut shops around Los Angeles for this column, I’ve realized that it’s nice to take a break from the “Instagram-famous” places sometimes. For that reason, I chose to have a regular, glazed donut, or what I like to call, “The OG Donut.” As you can expect with any classic donut, it was delicious, and perhaps that’s why it’s been an all-time treasure.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
For my second donut, I did not even hesitate to order one of their cronuts. Spudnuts offers a variety of fillings, but this morning, I went for the obvious choice: Nutella. The cronut was perfectly glazed and, though it was a little messy to eat, the Nutella was so perfectly plentiful that it oozed out of the sides. Pro Tip: only eat half of your cronut at the shop and take the other half home and refrigerate it for a few hours. Eating a somewhat hardened Nutella cronut is a whole new experience because most people haven’t tried cold Nutella. It’s something you must do at one point in your life.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
Overall, I was very pleased with the selection of donuts and enjoyed the ones I ordered, but as a suggestion, I think the shop could use a little work to make it more suitable for college students. Unfortunately, it’s a pretty small space, and there are only four small tables in the entire shop. I have never gone late at night — when it is the most popular — but I can only imagine that it must be difficult to seat large groups of friends. Regardless, I insist that every student visit Spudnuts at some point during his or her time at USC. It’s so close to campus, that you can even call a USC Uber or Campus Cruiser to take you there late at night, so there really is no excuse. After all, Spudnuts is a staple to the college experience that you do not want to miss out on!
Spudnuts is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 3001 S. Figueroa St. Los Angeles, CA 90007.

With resounding victories in back-to-back games against Washington State (9-12) and Washington (14-7), the Trojans are looking to close out their three-game homestand with a victory over crosstown rival UCLA. The win over Washington vaulted USC (17-5, 6-3) back into a tie for second place in the Pac-12 Conference, only one game back of Oregon.
This two-game winning streak comes on the heels of two disappointing losses to Oregon (18-4) and Oregon State (12-8). A few key adjustments as well as playing at home have really helped the Trojans. Against Washington State, the Trojans showcased their explosive offense by scoring 52 points in the first half. In front of a raucous crowd, the Trojans were able to push the pace and guard Katin Reinhardt was able to get many easy baskets en route to scoring a team-high 18 points. Another key that has helped the Trojans all year was their balanced scoring as five finished scored in double figures.
Against Washington, the Trojans looked to avenge their disappointing loss earlier in the season in which they blew a 22-point lead. They did so with their tremendous shooting and junior Nikola Jovanovic had easily his best game of the season with 28 points. The Trojans also did well in getting to the free throw line 37 times and hitting 32 of them.
In order to stay perfect at the Galen Center (13-0) and set a new school record for best start at home in a season, the Trojans will need to continue their offensive dominance. The last time the Trojans faced off against the Bruins, they came up with an 89-75 victory on the road. A large part of this victory was the Trojans’ excellent shooting and depth. The Trojans outscored the Bruins 32-2 in bench points led by freshman Chimezie Metu’s career-high 21 points.
An important key to winning this game will be the Trojans’ ability to share the ball and have multiple players contribute. They will also need to continue their hot shooting of late, especially from the 3-point line. Against the Bruins, the Trojans shot 45 percent from three with timely baskets keeping UCLA from making a comeback.
A final key to watch for is the Trojans interior defense where they have typically struggled. Senior forward Tony Parker and sophomore center Thomas Welsh combined for 43 points on 70 percent shooting the last time these two teams faced off. The Trojans will need to place more of an emphasis on preventing these two from getting easier looks inside the paint. Expect the Bruins to come out with a lot of energy in an effort to avenge their earlier loss at home. The Trojans will need to come out focused and feed off the energy of what will certainly be a packed Galen Center.

Wanderlust • Studying abroad allowed me to expand my horizons, and affected my senior year in more ways than I could have imagined. Emily Goldberg | Daily Trojan
With a little more than three and a half years of college under my belt, I consider myself somewhat old and wise. (If I didn’t, what did seven semesters’ worth of tuition go toward anyway?) Or at the very least, old and wise enough to offer a small suggestion to underclassmen. So heed my advice when I say do everything you can to take the chance to study abroad — even if it’s just for the summer. 
I studied abroad in Madrid during the second semester of my junior year, but the impact it has had on my college experience was much more than that one semester. With the one-year anniversary of my flight to Madrid last week, I would feel remiss to not write about it. At the risk of sounding cliché, like another girl who went to Europe for four months and came back saying it was “life changing,” just hear me out.  
Living in a foreign city for a finite amount of time with a seemingly endless list of activities to do and sights to see makes you want to take advantage of every waking moment. Spending the afternoon in bed watching Netflix was not an option when I had a city, country — hell, an entire continent — to explore. Of course it was impossible to see it all, but I did my best. 
My unrelenting urge to explore didn’t subside when I returned to L.A. for senior year. Instead, I channeled that energy into finding new places to eat (yes, mostly eat), drink, shop, see things and do things around L.A. If I was tourist in Madrid, what should stop me from being a tourist in L.A.? 
I learned that the end of study abroad didn’t have to mean the end of spontaneous weekend trips. Instead, it meant deciding to driving up to San Francisco to see the Pac-12 Championship game or spending a few days in Santa Barbara to celebrate being done with finals. 
Studying abroad gave me a new appreciation toward exploring L.A. and all of Southern California. Being from the East Coast, I still consider myself a tourist in California and especially so since I’m not sure if I’ll be in California after graduation. 
Studying abroad also gave me a much needed break from my routine at USC. By studying in Madrid, I was able to meet new people that have since become so important in my life. I was lucky enough to become such great friends with the people on my program that I can’t imagine what my senior year would look like without them. While some of the friends I made in Madrid were people I may not have crossed paths with on campus, others are people that I already knew as acquaintances but was able to get to know much better in a different setting. 
It’s so easy to fall into a routine on campus: you live with your friends, sit with people in class that you likely already know and go out with the same people. By junior year there’s a good chance you’ve found your place at USC. Maybe you’re content with that, maybe you’re ready for a change. 
The semester before I went to Madrid, I felt like the rest of my college experience was somewhat set in stone. Studying abroad changed it in the best way possible, and I could not recommend it more.
