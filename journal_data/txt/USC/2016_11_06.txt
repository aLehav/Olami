 
Two USC alumni have created a mobile app that allows users to play fantasy basketball with a few swipes of their fingers.
Brandon Asherian and Matthew Khorsandi, who graduated in 2015 with degrees in business administration, created Starting Five to cater to people who have become exhausted trying to pick their independent, original teams among professional fantasy sports players.

“For most people, daily fantasy contests feel like rigged lotteries,” Asherian wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “You enter a prize pool versus 10,000 random individuals, most of whom are daily fantasy sports professionals who make a living entering these contests.”
Asherian wrote that in contrast, Starting Five users play one-on-one, either with friends or against a random opponent. He wrote that the app makes it easier for people of different skill levels to play by utilizing pre-set lineups.
“We do part of the heavy lifting by hand-selecting four unique fantasy teams per night,” Asherian wrote. “Players then select the team they feel has the greatest likelihood of success. Think of it as Tinder meets daily fantasy sports in the sense that we have pre-set lineups that players can select by swiping left and right.”
According to Asherian, Starting Five focuses on bridging the gap between season-long fantasy sports and daily fantasy sports by bringing the social elements of season-long fantasy into a simplified daily model.
“I started asking many of my friends why they don’t play daily fantasy sports, and the most common answers were ‘It’s impossible to win,’ ‘I don’t have the time’ or ‘I’d rather play with my friends,’” Asherian wrote. “We cater to casual fantasy players that are tired of being taken advantage of by random professional players on Fanduel and DraftKings.”
The beta version of Starting Five was launched in January, and the official app is now available for this NBA season, as the company completed its first fundraiser.
Asherian wrote that the concept of the business first came to mind while he was in enrolled in a business class at USC that focused on understanding market opportunities  — which meant that he had to find out what the market was missing and develop a business plan for a product or service around that. While conducting research, Asherian wrote that he interviewed a number of people that pointed him in the direction of a fantasy sports app.
“During those interviews I was asked questions like, ‘How would you help cater our product to casual sports fans,’ or ‘How can we convert season-long fantasy sports players into daily players?’” Asherian wrote. “Those questions inspired me to streamline the most difficult part of daily fantasy—the process of picking a lineup. That, coupled with the ability to challenge friends and chat with them over the app, is the foundation of Starting Five.”
After he graduated from USC, Asherian developed his class project into an actual business. He also wrote that the long-term friendship between the co-founders, who met in elementary school and were roommates at USC, further helped them to create a strong team.
“While we are best friends and business partners, we are also totally different people,” Asherian wrote. “I am obsessed with sports, detail-oriented and somewhat technical. Matt is passionate about music, makes quick decisions and has an uncanny understanding of people. Our strengths complement each other’s weaknesses, which makes for an extremely healthy partnership.”
With Starting Five, Asherian and Khorsandi aim to remove the barriers to playing fantasy sports.
“We are using fantasy basketball as our launch point,” Asherian wrote. “Our plan at the moment is to learn from our users and continuously improve the product.”

Though Election Day is on Nov. 8, for millions of Americans it has already come and gone. According to the U.S. Election Project, over 40 million Americans — including many USC students — have cast their ballots early, whether because they prefer voting by mail or because they are not going to be physically present at a polling place on Election Day. And for many college students, mail-in voting dramatically increases the ease and likelihood of participating in the electoral process.
“I always mailed in my ballots, so it all came rather intuitively after I came here for school,” said Ryan Smith, a junior majoring in business administration who is using an absentee ballot to vote in his home state of Washington. “The biggest reason is ease. I don’t have a car here, but the post office on campus is on my walk to class.”
Julienna Law, a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism, also cited convenience as the primary reason why she and many of her friends are using mail-in ballots. Law said she believes mail-in voting not only allows students to vote when it is most suitable for them, but that it also ensures people have the opportunity to research propositions, senators and representatives on the ballot while in the comfort of their own homes.
“One of the advantages of voting by mail is that you have time to think about your decisions and research the propositions thoroughly,” Law said. “If I were in a polling station, and I was confused about what to vote for, I may randomly make a decision and that isn’t helpful.”
According to Smith, the negativity characterizing much of this election has caused some of his friends to feel disappointed in the system. He said that mail-in ballots offer an easier path to voting for students who may otherwise not have the motivation to go out to a polling station.
“I know several friends who are very disillusioned by this election and lack the incentive to make the trip out to polling stations,” Smith said. “Mailing-in provides near minimal effort for equal voice.”
Law said that she believes if mail-in voting were not an option, college student voter turnout would decrease, because many students may not be able to find the time to make it out to a polling place.
“The convenience factor of mail-in voting allows for higher turnout rates,” Law said. “I don’t have a car, so it’s harder for me to get to a polling place. The option of mailing in a ballot opens up an opportunity for more people to vote, especially those who may live far from a polling station.”
Noha Ayoub, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, is not mailing in her ballot. While she acknowledged the importance of offering people different ways to vote, she said that physically going to a polling station serves as a bonding experience for everyone who is present.
“While voting by mail still fulfills what I believe to be a civic duty and is therefore always positive, voting in person allows for communal voting which I think heightens the experience,” Ayoub said. “I think voting with others, in person, fosters communal civic engagement that makes voting a more positive experience.”
Nevertheless, Ayoub said that regardless of whether or not a person is voting in-person or via a mail-in ballot, the controversial nature of this election has inspired citizens to get more involved in politics.
“This election has become so polarized that the stakes on both sides of the political spectrum have skyrocketed and thus motivated people to vote,” Ayoub said. “I think we will see higher voter turnout rates, which is a good thing, because it shows that people are becoming more engaged in our country’s electoral process.”

Students, faculty and investors gathered in the Tutor Campus Center Grand Ballroom on Sunday to network with start-ups from the United States and Israel as well as to learn more about the startup ecosystem in the world at large.
Emily Smith | Daily TrojanRoot of innovation · (From left to right) James Bottom, Shirin Laor-Raz Salemnia, Guy Katsovich, Howard Singer and Arik Benzino participated in a panel held during the Cal-Israel Innovation Expo on Sunday morning.
The Cal-Israel Innovation Expo was hosted by the TAMID Group in partnership with Blackstone Launchpad USC. Thirty-four startups were present at the expo, with some looking for employees and interns, and others looking for funding to take their ideas to the next level. These budding companies showcased innovations in areas such as medical, energy and water conservation, mobile and cyber technology and agribusiness.
USC TAMID is a nationwide student organization that connects business-focused American students with Israeli companies in a wide variety of educational and professional opportunities. The organization provides free consulting services to small businesses in Israel and organizes a fund to invest in businesses in the area. The ultimate goal of these programs is to orient members in the economic landscape of Israel and, by extension, the world at large.
According to Noa Braun, the president of USC TAMID, the event sought to have representation from as many industries as possible.
“We look for a breadth of companies,” Braun said. “That’s really important to us. We don’t want to have everybody concentrated in just biotech, or just security, so you’ll see if you walk around the expo everybody is scattered across all industries.”
According to Wharton Magazine, Tel Aviv is the number five startup ecosystem in the world behind Boston, Los Angeles, New York City and Silicon Valley. Yoram Dahan, volunteer CEO of the Cal-Israeli Innovation Expo, said that this atmosphere of innovation could come from Israel’s military, which is building strong young leaders with ideas to solve real world problems.
“Israel has a unique opportunity to bring a lot of innovations, mostly because the young students and audience providing these kinds of startups and thinking usually go into military service and gain a lot of confident knowledge leadership and come out with some amazing innovations,” Dahan said.
According to James Bottom, director of Blackstone Launchpad USC, the atmosphere of innovation could also come from the country’s global circumstances surrounded by enemies and with few natural resources.
“They have had to be really innovative with how they have been able to create partnerships and trade deals to be able to bring resources into their country, which has allowed them to prosper,” Bottom said. “And I think because of that they have built up really good relationships.”
Bottom was an honorary speaker on Sunday’s panel. On Monday, guests will hear from Yannis Yortsos, the Dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering. The event is open to all USC students interested in learning about new innovations and the startup ecosystem of Israel.

The start of November brought much of the same excitement as October for the USC football team. The Trojans turned in another impressive performance with a resounding victory over the visiting Oregon Ducks Saturday. The last five games have all followed the same script — USC’s defense shutting down an opponent’s potent offense, while putting together an impressive offensive showcase of their own.
Tal Volk | Daily TrojanDog pound · Head coach Clay Helton has a chance for an upset win this week as the Trojans travel to Seattle to face the No. 5 Huskies. Helton’s squad has lost on the road to all three ranked opponents they have faced this season.
This five-game stretch has taught us many things about the Trojans: Redshirt freshman Sam Darnold is one of the best quarterbacks in college football, USC’s defense is eminently capable when they blitz and head coach Clay Helton does an excellent job of getting his team ready to play and win the games they should.
This is an exceptionally important and underrated characteristic of an elite football coach. So far, Helton has won every game this season that he was supposed to win. That is more than one can say for the previous two regimes at USC, and even the great Pete Carroll struggled in his final season with putting away inferior opponents. It is refreshing to have a team that shows up and turns in consistent performances week in and week out.
The question of whether or not Helton is competent has been answered. He is, and he has grown each week on the job. However, competent is not enough at USC. The Trojans need an elite coach, and the best coaches beat teams of equal or better talent. This coming Saturday, Helton has a chance to demonstrate he belongs in that conversation. Unless it is a blowout of epic proportions, one game won’t automatically propel him into the rarified coaching stratosphere, but it will answer questions about his big-game ability.
This game against Washington is going to be a tough one. The Huskies are an elite squad replete with plenty of talent and an excellent coach. Their front four is able to consistently generate pressure and the secondary is fast and swarming, with future NFL star Budda Baker leading that unit. Their offense is equally imposing, with a talented and accurate passer and great speed at their skill position spots.
So far this year, the Trojans have been lacking in big games. Whether or not that was attributable to Helton learning on the job, the incorrect quarterback playing or simply a barrage of miscues on a rainy Friday night in Utah, USC has a chance to rectify those mistakes and solidify their image as a premier team with a win against Washington.
Moreover, this game means a lot for Helton. It is one thing to beat .500 teams, which silences critics temporarily. It is an entirely different matter to enter hostile territory and score a victory over a top-five, undefeated squad. Helton needs this victory to prove that he is the man for the job. A win doesn’t disqualify him, but going zero for four against quality opponents on the road or at neutral sites will leave a lot of questions entering the offseason.
As good as Washington is, USC is well suited to beat them. When pressured, sophomore quarterback Jake Browning is not as poised as his incredible statistics would otherwise indicate. The Husky defense’s aggressive nature can be used against them with misdirection and screens. A well-schemed game plan combined with USC’s immense talent on both sides of the ball will yield a victory against the Huskies.
To beat them, Helton has to turn in the best coaching performance of his young career. The team can’t play the way they did against Oregon and expect a similar result. Racking up penalties in the double digits won’t work against a better foe.
Helton will need to ensure sophomore Iman Marshall and the other defensive backs opposite junior Adoree’ Jackson can handle either Dante Pettis or John Ross, as Jackson can only shadow one of the star wideouts all game long.
The offense will have to be crisper than it was against Oregon. While they did score 45 points, the Trojans left points out on the field with errant connections and missed blocks. It is weird to complain about a quarterback who completed 70 percent of his passes for 300 yards and had some major runs and improvisational passes, but Darnold was somewhat off his game against the Ducks. He will need to revert back to the form he has shown in every prior game this year, with a bit more velocity and accuracy on his throws than on Saturday.
On the bright side, sophomore running back Ronald Jones II is back to the stunning sensation he was a season ago, which adds another dimension to the offense. Additionally, the emergences of freshman wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. and sophomore wide receiver Deontay Burnett as legitimate options helps the offense have extra weapons. While only a freshman, Pittman has the hands, body type and marvelous ability after the catch that surely projects he will be the next great Trojan wide out. Burnett has always had standout speed, but has now taken his game to the next level with sure-handed receptions and precise route running.
The Trojans will need contributions from players like these as well as their stars to come back from Seattle with a victory. More than that, they will need an aggressive scheme and a coach playing to win, who doesn’t shy away from the spotlight or moment. This is Helton’s chance to cement his status as the Trojan’s coach, and I am hopeful he will be able to emphatically announce with a statement victory that he is the guy to lead the Trojans for the foreseeable future.

The No. 2 Trojans (19-1) handled the visiting San Jose State Spartans (7-18) with a 19-1 victory at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Sunday afternoon.
Sunday’s win marks the 11th-straight victory for the Trojans, who entered the game with an unblemished 6-0 record at home.
Matt Karatsu | Daily TrojanMaking waves · Junior goalie McQuin Baron and the Trojans won their 10th straight game with a 19-1 win over San Jose State. on Sunday. Baron was helped by a defense that came up with 12 steals.
The Trojans started off the game in dominating fashion thanks to expert defense and precise shooting. Fouls from several Spartan defenders early on opened up USC’s forwards to net four goals in the first period.
An exclusion penalty against the Trojans gave the Spartans a man-advantage that culminated in a right-side goal from Weber to give San Jose hope.
“Those are the things we need to work on going forward,” freshman driver Marin Dasic said. “Defense is the number one priority for us, and we can’t let those things happen. You can’t play a perfect game, obviously, but we need to get better.”
With a 4-0 lead at the end of the first, the second period was more of the same for the Men of Troy as USC scored four more goals in a period dominated by a Trojan offense.
And while San Jose’s starting goalie Conrad Gordon was valiant in the second period with multiple saves, the Spartans’ inability to keep USC out of their defensive zone permitted the Trojans to get off multiple close-range shots.
At the end of the first half, USC led 8-1, with five different Trojans scoring goals.
Already with a seven-goal lead, the Trojans started off the second half slower than expected due to replacement goalie TJ Palmer’s numerous saves.
A multitude of USC turnovers gave SJSU adequate opportunities to score. However, the Spartans offense could not capitalize.
Eventually, the Men of Troy would break through the Spartans defense with a third-period scoring spree that included six goals. Freshman driver Thomas Dunstan started off the USC attack with a right-side ripper.
Junior driver Matteo Morelli earned yet another hat trick halfway through the third off a close-range penalty shot goal.
For San Jose State, its lack of bench depth appeared to be an issue as the game dragged on, considering the Spartans’ six available players paled in comparison to USC’s 16.
With a 14-1 lead going into the final frame, USC kept the scoring going with five more from the likes of Dasic, sophomore driver Zach D’Sa, freshman two-meter Matt Maier, junior utility James Walters and redshirt sophomore driver Brock Hudnut.
In the end, Morelli joined Dasic and Walters as the only three Trojans to score three goals a piece.
Now at 19-1, the Trojans go into the final week of the regular season with an excitement toward their final game against rival and the No. 1 team in the country in UCLA.
Walters, who scored his three of his 13 goals on Sunday, emphasized the importance of playing a team like San Jose State.
“You treat every opponent with respect, and you have to have that discipline to play your own game. I thought everything went well today,” Walters said. “As far as the team’s confidence against UCLA, we want to win. As long as we stick to our gameplan, we should do that.”

As I have mentioned in previous columns, I grew up in a suburb where almost everybody around me was Asian or Asian American. I’ve never been as aware of how “Asian” I felt until I started college. Unlike Diamond Bar, USC is extremely diverse, and I love it. I never wanted to be the type of person who surrounded myself with the same type of people. I’ve always been open to meeting and being around people of different cultures and walks of life.
However, one of my closest friends during my sophomore year at USC ended up being from the same area as me. We bonded over being transfers and the similarities in our upbringing.
One of the things we didn’t have in common, however, was how she would always tell me about how she wished she was white and how she hated being Asian.
When we would go out and a sea of white, blonde girls would walk past us, she would sigh loudly and tell me how she wished she could look like them and how life would be much easier if she did. I understood, and yet it would annoy me. She was pretty, too — why did it have to be in that way? She would complain to me that if she were white, then more guys would pay attention to her at parties. She would be self-conscious when she was the only Asian person in a social setting. Sometimes, I wouldn’t know how to respond. I wanted to be able to understand her rather than judge her. Why does being at USC make her want to be white, when at her previous school where Asians were the majority, she didn’t mind? Am I supposed to feel this way, too?
She was born in China and I wasn’t, so maybe there were a lot of struggles I could never understand. When she came to America, her main goal was to assimilate. She wanted to learn English, erase her accent and stop dressing and acting like a “FOB,” a term meaning “fresh off the boat.”
But, with assimilation comes  erasing of identity. It makes me feel disheartened to think that in her eyes, in order to fit in, she must have to hate who she is and want to be somebody else. I thought about how as Asian Americans, we would never completely fit into Asian or white culture. I thought about the amount of Asians I know who are completely whitewashed and out of touch with their culture and roots — would I want to be like that?
This friendship really opened my eyes to a lot of issues of hatred and identity that many Asians and Asian Americans face. While it is definitely true that white privilege exists and many people of different backgrounds aren’t given the same opportunities, I wouldn’t want to change who I am. Self-love is a healing process and it’s often difficult to be able to see the results. As minorities, we come from a colorful and beautiful culture that is worth being proud of. I hope one day my friend can feel that way, too.

When Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare was first announced back in May, it was met with great backlash. Despite racking up over 8 million views in its first week, the trailer was met with over 370,000 dislikes. Since then, that number has grown to a staggering 3 million plus dislikes to only a measly 500,000 or so likes.
Reasons for the hate are due to fan’s dislike of Call of Duty going too much into the future with its ridiculous weapons and a desire for the game to go back to modern technology.
Photo from ActivisionTo infinity and beyond · Unlike the previous Call of Duty games, Infinite Warfare is known for its space-themed weapons.
Activision was able to gain back some fans when it announced that the original Modern Warfare would be bundled with their latest entry in the storied franchise. Unfortunately, fans quickly turned sour once again after learning that, in order to receive the remaster of Modern Warfare, they would need to buy the $79.99 Legacy Edition of Infinite Warfare rather than the base $59.99 version of the game.
Several months later, Infinite Warfare is finally here and despite all of the hatred leading up to its release, it’s a fantastic game. For the first time ever, Call of Duty is abandoning its “modern” character and going completely into uncharted territory, space. It’s certainly an interesting concept, and for the most part, it delivers.
As time has gone on the campaigns in Call of Duty have grown stale. Infinite Warfare serves as a sort of revival. The game’s complex story is boosted by a fantastic cast of characters and strong writing to match.
The new interstellar setting allows for a wider variety of environments to fight in. While the combat is largely the same wave-based structure, the added variety of missions taking place on Earth’s moon or an asteroid help make things feel fresh. More so, the added dogfights in space help add even more variety to the game.
While the campaign’s length is in line with previous installments at about seven hours, there is the added bonus of side missions. Unlike the RTS-esque missions in Black Ops 2, the side missions in Infinite Warfare feature more dogfights and other combat scenarios, and are a blast to play through.
Of course, most people purchasing Call of Duty are not doing so because of the campaign, but rather the franchise’s stellar multiplayer, which has been a mainstay of the series for years.
For those who have played Black Ops 3, the multiplayer is largely the same. The ability to boost, slide and run on walls has returned, as has the ability to have various characters with differing abilities.
Many of the new additions to the multiplayer come in the form of progression. Missions are now part of multiplayer and players are able to choose one of three teams to complete various missions for.
These missions range from getting a certain amount of kills to more objective-based duties. Completing said missions will grant various new weapon types as well as new skins to match and help level up the team as a whole in order to unlock more teams with more complex objectives.
It’s a fun addition and certainly prevents players from quitting early on in a match that has gone south. The idea that even in defeat you’re still winning has been a mainstay in Call of Duty, and the new missions concept helps reinforce that idea.
The final addition to multiplayer is a revamped supply drop system. As in Black Ops 3, consistently leveling up grants keys that can be spent at the in-game store for supply drops which vary in cost and carry an assortment of skins, calling cards and weapons. While the concept might  feel like paying to win, Call of Duty does not take much skill to play in the first place. Therefore, having the rarest weapon won’t necessarily guarantee victory. Still, such frustration around this unlock system can be understood and its validity in a game like Call of Duty is debatable.
The final part of the three-part package is the Zombies mode. The fan-favorite mode remains a part of Infinite Warfare, and it brings with it its own quirks and oddities. This year’s Zombies takes place in the 1980s at an amusement park. The fundamentals remain the same, but this particular installment caters to beginners and seasoned veterans alike.
Unlike Treyarch’s Zombies mode, signs and maps help point players in the right direction, and a toned down difficulty allows players to actually get far and explore the world that Infinity Ward has created. It’s certainly a welcomed change and in no way hurts the popular mode.
Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is a fantastic game. While it may have received criticism in the beginning, the team at Infinity Ward has crafted a brand new universe for fans to dig into. The futuristic space-like setting allows for one of the best campaigns in the series and the additions to multiplayer mode help make a franchise staple feel fresh.
The added Zombies mode is certainly welcome and is a blast to play with friends as always. Overall, Infinite Warfare is a complete package that’s definitely worth checking out.

In conjunction with the Red Bull Sound Select’s “30 Days in L.A.,” music label Stones Throw Records celebrated its 20th anniversary at Sycamore Grove Park in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles by bringing their best artists to the stage for a public concert, free of charge. The concert featured Grammy and Academy Award-winning rapper Common as the headliner and label artists such as Peanut Butter Wolf, Dam-Funk, J-Rocc, MNDSGN, Gabriel Garzón Montano, Homeboy Sandman, Iman Omari and Chrome Canyon.
Stones Throw has released many acclaimed underground hip-hop records, such as Madvilliany by artists MF Doom and Madlib, Yessir Whatever by rapper Quasimoto, as well as the collections of famed hip-hop producer J Dilla.
Sean Keith | Daily TrojanEverybody clap your hands · Singer Gabriel Garzón Montano (above) performs his newest single “Sour Mango” at Stones Throw Superfest, part of Red Bull’s “30 Days in L.A.” Common also performed as the headliner for the festival, a free public event at Sycamore Grove Park.
The label was also featured in the documentary Our Vinyl Weighs a Ton, which illustrates the label’s historic and trailblazing impact on hip-hop. Stones Throw is also the former label of pop and R&B singer Aloe Blacc, a USC alum.
The venue at Sycamore Grove Park treated attendees to an amphitheater-style stage with the crowd sprawled out on the lawn, listening on the mesa-styled bench seating or leaning up against the railing. Food trucks and vendors such as Coolhaus, Max City BBQ, Seoul Sausage, Humble Crust, Made In Brooklyn Pizza and Southern Fried Vegan supplied good eats for festival attendees.
One of Stones Throw’s bands, Chrome Canyons, performed a futuristic electro-rock set with the frontman, Morgan Z, on vocals, keys and theremin. The band played songs from their 2012 release, Elemental Themes, and struck well with the crowd over their tones that brings the Stranger Things and Tron soundtracks fused with the work of Tame Impala to mind.
The next performer, Gabriel Garzón Montano, played a solo set with an elaborate floral arrangement draped over his piano. His most recent single, “Sour Mango” was released by Stones Throw on Nov. 2 in anticipation of his debut album with the label, Jardín, available on Jan. 27. Notably, the number of people in the crowd increased after hearing the rhythms and chorus from this new release.
Artist Garzón-Montano who performs all the instruments live and on his studio releases, then delved into new works and his best pieces from his previous album, Bishouné: Alma del Huila. Songs such as “Me Alone” invoked thoughts of Prince, and the beat of “Keep on Running” exhibited both soul and hip hop influences. The crowd was impressed with this recent signee.
Mndsgn (pronounced “mind design”), a hip-hop artist and producer whose most recent album, Body Wash was released this September by Stones Throw, performed next. The performer brought out a live band complete with a horns section, and took a creatively pleasing route by meshing his synth-heavy sounds with the rest of his outfit. Mndsgn takes some influences from prog-funk, and had the audience’s heads nodding with his songs from his last release and Yawn Zen, his 2014 release that had hits such as “Camelblues,” which has over 1 million views on Youtube.
Common, the headliner, finished the night with a riveting set where he played hits such as “The Light,” “Love of My Life” and “The Food,” and freestyled over beats as sundown hit Highland Park over the fan’s cheers.
Mild High Club, the solo act of Alex Brettin, performed coming off the release of Skiptracing. Brettin, known for performing along with Mac DeMarco, received acclaim for his sophomore project, a vintage infused project with low-fi and filtered tracks that fall into the slacker-rock genre. The performance, despite a seemingly simple rock outfit, was technically impressive as the guitars and their solos showed talent in a hazy rock groove. Skiptracing, the album and its songs, have an effortless vibe to them, but the audience enjoyed the relaxed and spacy energy the band created on the Saturday afternoon.

The presidential election is tomorrow — a momentous day sure to be filled with excitement and anxiety across the political spectrum. Tomorrow might be the day that the United States elects its first female president. Though this question will remain unanswered until Tuesday night, there is one thing we know that is regrettably certain; the 2016 presidential election will be the first in 50 years without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. As gathered evidence reveals that the consequences of this new reality are particularly burdensome for racial minorities, the time to restore the Voting Rights Act is now.
In a 2013 decision known as Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court struck down a portion of the Voting Rights Act that required states to submit a request for “pre-clearance” before any changes to voting practices could be made. The federal government was responsible for determining whether these changes comported with election laws. This “pre-clearance” provision was designed to catch discriminatory practices before elections occurred. In the absence of this safeguard, several states have instituted a number of potentially discriminatory practices, including changes to early voting, absentee voting and voter ID requirements. Critics of the Supreme Court’s decision argued that Republican officials have used this loophole to restrict the right of left-leaning, racial minorities to vote in their districts.
Since Shelby, several federal lawsuits claiming discriminatory practices have been filed. Last week, new federal lawsuits were filed against five battleground states: Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina. The lawsuits all claim that Republican officials have unlawfully removed black voters from voter registration lists. In North Carolina, for example, a registered voter in the state can challenge the registration of another voter. In the past — before Shelby — a challenge would be sent to the federal government for “pre-clearance.” According to federal standards, states cannot remove voters’ names from registration lists fewer than 90 days before an election. North Carolina law allows this to occur up to 25 days before an election. The NAACP, recognizing the disproportionate impact this practice has had on black voters in North Carolina, filed the federal lawsuit, which focuses on Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland counties, where thousands of black voters have been challenged. In Beaufort County, 65 percent of the challenges are against black voters, while in Moore County the secretary of the county’s Republican Party challenged the registration of nearly 400 voters.
Meanwhile, in states like Arizona, polling places in areas where racial minorities predominantly live have completely closed. In Phoenix’s Maricopa County, an unnerving trend has emerged. Since 2012, Republican election officials, emboldened by the Shelby decision, have reduced the number of polling places by 70 percent, from 200 polling places to just 60. Maricopa County’s troubles brings back memories of 2006 when the Justice Department sued Cochise County, which is 30 percent Latino, for failing to print election materials in Spanish or provide Spanish-speaking poll workers — a violation of the VRA. Today, Cochise County is the country’s largest “closer” by percentage. Since Shelby, it has closed 63 percent of its polling places.
Elected officials typically cite a number of reasons for polling place closures. Most counties cite an insufficient budget. Some counties have, over the years, transitioned to “vote centers” — a new concept that allows county residents to vote anywhere they choose, instead of an assigned location, to mitigate the inconvenience of fewer voting locations. During the presidential primary, this model proved to be a disaster in Maricopa County, when officials designated far fewer polling places than were necessary. Though elected officials will likely cloak discriminatory intent with claims about budget shortfalls, the public still has a responsibility to investigate and question election processes and seek to ensure that politicians do not establish self-serving policies without oversight.
We unfortunately cannot reverse the impact that the Shelby decision has potentially had on this year’s presidential election. However, we can seek to ensure that voters, especially racial minorities, are not disenfranchised in future elections. Encourage your representatives to support the Voting Rights Amendment of 2015 — a piece of legislation that would restore pre-clearance practices and renewed transparency to elections.

Requiring voter ID should be mandatory in all 50 states and in DC.  The liberals don’t want it because it interferes with their continued practice of stuffing ballot boxes and executing voter fraud endeavors.  Everyone else wants to to provide some modicum of protection against dead people voting, illegals voting, busing in voters and voting multiple times by the same person. 
If you are against a Voter ID law, for any reason, you are for the continued practice if voter fraud.  And that my friend is unAmerican and unconstitutional.  Instituting a Voter ID law had nothing to do with keeping a legal voter from voting. If you think that’s the case, I have some land to sell you on the moon.  
No new legislation is needed. The Supreme Court struck down only one provision in the Voting Rights
Act – which was indeed unconstitutional, unfair, and outdated, and which was
never a permanent part of the Act anyway – and there are plenty of other
voting-rights laws available to ensure that the right to vote is not violated.
What’s more, the principal bill that has been drafted is bad legislation. For
example, it does not protect all races equally from discrimination; it contains
much that has nothing to do with the Supreme Court’s decision; and it itself
violates the Constitution by prohibiting practices that are not actually
racially discriminatory but only have racially disproportionate effects. The
bill is also hopelessly partisan; at Senate hearings, it was clear that no
Republican there would favor it, because it is designed to give a partisan
advantage to the Left.

A study published in the Review of Educational Research last week suggested that “positive climates” within academic institutions contributed to narrowing achievement gaps among students from varying socioeconomic backgrounds. The authors included the University of Southern California’s Ron Avi Astor, a professor of social work and education, and Hadass Moore, a Ph.D. student studying cultural diversity in the education system, among other topics pertaining to identity. The study emphasized the fact that more investment should be made in creating an inclusive campus climate.
Emilie Skoog | Daily Trojan
Astor, Moore and their co-authors analyzed 78 studies looking into the relationship between classroom climate, academic achievement and socioeconomic statuses of students from 2000 to 2015.
“Our findings suggest that by promoting a positive climate, schools can allow greater equality in educational opportunities, decrease socioeconomic inequalities, and enable more social mobility,” Astor wrote.
The different experiences of students of all identities, ranging from gender identity and sexual orientation to race and ethnicity, affect their academic needs and learning experiences. As the study suggests, when academic institutions acknowledge and address aspects of students’ identities and invest in positive, inclusive climates, this results in real benefits for their students. Positive campus climates for diverse student bodies, for instance, could include diverse staff and faculty to whom students of all backgrounds are able to relate and connect, the accessibility of opportunities for all and financial investment in reducing the economic burden of attending university for students of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, investing in campus programs and cultural education initiatives to mitigate everyday microaggressions targeting students of marginalized groups and inducing anxiety and struggles with mental health have substantially affected academic performance.
Within academic environments, struggles that may on the surface seem minimal, such as difficulty finding the “proper” bathroom to use or not being able to afford menstrual products (addressed by a recent initiative at Brown University this year), can often pose undue burdens on the mental health of students and affect their academic performances. Microaggressions can also exist in everyday dialogue between students, not as a result of malicious intent, but often privilege or ignorance, and universities could foster more positive and inclusive social environments by investing in programs promoting sensitivity, awareness and education.
The measure of any top-tier learning institution should be the effort it puts into offering students of all backgrounds an enriching, welcoming collegiate experience. When academic institutions prioritize and invest in creating inclusive atmospheres which address the various backgrounds of their students, everyone benefits. On a purely scholastic level, investing in a positive climate is not only to the benefit of students of marginalized groups, but also the administration who benefit from the educational achievements of their student body.
Investing in positive campus climates promotes the very diversity that institutions evaluating and ranking universities prize. For instance, USC was ranked 15th in the nation by the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, in no small part due to the diversity of its student body, from its impressive population of students of color to the high proportion of Pell Grant-eligible and first generation students in its undergraduate student body.
To those who are not sold on investing in a positive campus climate that welcomes students of marginalized groups and invests in bridging socioeconomic divides, for its moral implications and the many enriching cultural exchanges this would heed, there is no denying that investing in a positive campus climate would boost university prestige, and, as the study suggests, academic excellence. If institutions such as U.S. News & World Report or the Wall Street Journal are not already taking campus climate into account as they evaluate American universities, they certainly should, as campus climate speaks to diversity at an institution more than mere numbers and proportions to boast about, as well as how much the institution genuinely values diversity.
Last year, the Undergraduate Student Government released a resolution on campus climate meant to acknowledge and address hostilities and identity-related struggles of the school’s student body. The resolution resulted in collaboration between students and faculty to pursue various initiatives on campus climate that are still being explored. Campus climate and the experiences of students of marginalized groups are unfortunately deeply rooted in ingrained societal attitudes, prejudices, and privilege, and, as a result, can be difficult to combat directly.
But as the study by Astor and others indicates, the benefits precipitated by a positive campus climate are worth pursuing and investing in.
