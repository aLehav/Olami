Gerald “Jerry” Bender, associate professor emeritus of international relations and 31-year USC faculty member, died May 22 in Los Angeles from emphysema and kidney failure. He was 75. 
Bender was considered one of the leading experts on the politics, languages and culture of Angola. He had an interest in United States foreign policy toward southern Africa. He traveled there nearly 100 times, serving as an unofficial ambassador, but remaining a passionate advocate for the people of Angola. He liked to refer to himself as an activist scholar, hoping to improve U.S. foreign policy while teaching and studying international relations. 
After earning his undergraduate degree in political science at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, he attended UCLA to earn a master’s and doctoral degrees in the same subject. He began teaching at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in 1979. Bender spent three decades teaching in the international relations department before retiring in 2011. He also served as director of the School of International Relations from 1986 to 1991.
Bender is survived by Sandie Taylor, brother Michael Bender, sister-in-law Cindy Royce, niece Melanie Taylor and great-nieces Talia and Juliana Martino.
A service celebrating his life will be held July 8 on the University Park Campus.

The World Bachelor in Business program is neither for the timid nor the tame. The WBB, as it is known on campus, takes a select cohort of students to three different universities around the world to gain a global approach to their business education during their time as undergraduate students. The inaugural WBB class graduated in 2017.
The program was launched in 2013 by the USC Marshall School of Business in conjunction with two other universities after fine-tuning the program for over two years. 
Students in WBB study at USC during their first year before venturing to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for their sophomore year. Once completed, students attend Bocconi University in Milan for their junior year. For the students’ senior years, they get to choose where they want to return to — either USC, HKUST, or remain at Bocconi. 
Aseem Afsah recently completed his WBB experience, completing his final year at USC. He graduated summa cum laude from the University.
“Looking back on myself during this time, I feel like I was kind of like a starry-eyed baby just seeing the whole world for the first time,” Afsah said.
Now in 2017, the program has seen its first round of WBB students graduate, collecting not one, but three diplomas from each of the three universities. 
Though her undergraduate education has now come to a close, senior Angela Zhou said the commencement ceremony was not as nostalgic and emotional as it might have been for other students. 
“Every single year, for the past four years, has felt like almost a mini-graduation where we had to leave USC to go to Hong Kong and leave Hong Kong to go to Italy,” Zhou said.
For Zhou, the non-stop movement from country to country is what sets the WBB program — and its students — apart from the average undergraduate experience.
The obstacles that come with receiving a cross-continental education foster a global mindset within the WBB students, challenging them to go out of their comfort zones. From security checks at the airport to applying for visas and setting up a foreign bank account, the cross-border challenges that WBB students face create a experience  that dissents from the typical college experience, according to Ashley Nguyen, a rising sophomore in the WBB program.
“Americans in general don’t think about applying to out-of-country universities,” Nguyen said. “Through this program, I will be able to learn how to adapt to different situations better and maneuver my way through my career.”
Afsah said that the program has challenged his worldview. 
“We have grown this ability to see in many different ways and to consider many different perspectives,” Afsah said. “Spending two or three years abroad and consistently having your worldviews challenged make us a lot more adaptable and open-minded.”
Over the past four years the program has grown and adapted to the challenges that the students face. For Zhou, she hopes that this program continues to inspire college students to gain a study abroad education.
“Universities should champion more unconventional programs such as [the WBB] … to allow students to get an in-depth view of other cultures, campuses and academic settings that allow for a more intellectual and dynamic conversation within the student body,” Zhou said. 
After studying on three different continents, the World Bachelor in Business students are exposed to an international education that prepares them for success in a globalized society.

The freshman summer orientation sessions have been re-structured to better address the needs of first-generation college students, as well as incoming freshmen who may be unfamiliar with University procedures, according to the Office of Orientation Programs.
Julia Stanton, associate director of orientation programs, said that a first-generation student information session will be added to the orientation schedule this year. 
“We know the percentage of first-generation students, and it’s such a significant portion of the USC population, so we knew it was an important addition to our program,” Stanton said.
Stanton also said that upon request the guest fee for that particular session can be waived for the parent or guest of a first-generation student. 
“We wanted to offer an option for people who might be in a hard financial situation to get the information they need,” Stanton said. 
Monica David, a rising sophomore currently working as an orientation advisor, stated that one of the main goals of the orientation program is to prepare new students for what to expect when they begin their first year. 
“We want them to feel more confident coming in, and know what resources are available to them,” David said.   
In addition, Lisa Starr, the director of USC Orientation Programs said that the first day of orientation will be dedicated to students drafting academic plans with their advisers prior to course registration.
Since the USC Village is not expected to be open to students until late July, a large percentage of incoming freshmen who plan to live there will not be able to participate in housing tours that are typically included in the orientation program. However, David asserted that the orientation advisors were prepared to manage any feelings of uncertainty. 
In addition, Starr said that the students will be given an introduction to the renewed residential college experience on the second day of orientation. 
Following the tradition of previous years, the program will focus on helping new students register for classes online and adjust to their new living situations. Orientation advisors will perform a skit in which members of the incoming class are introduced to some scenarios that the typical college student may face — for instance, stress from schoolwork and a number of other social situations. In addition, the orientation advisors will make themselves available to the students to engage in one-on-one conversations and help build more personal relationships.
“We’re so excited for this new class and ready with an amazing orientation staff [to get] all the new students registered,” Starr said.
According to David, the increase in the freshman class size is one of the biggest changes from previous years. In the past year, the incoming first-year class size rose from 3,068 students to approximately 3,560 students. To make adjustments for this increase, students who finish their class registration early will now have the opportunity to participate in activities that allow them to experience a taste of general education seminars and freshman seminars.
“Students will be able to go into the ceramics room and play around with the 3D printer,” David said. “This is to ensure that [General Education Seminars] and freshman seminars have more students, and that these students will be more excited about it.”
This year, the orientation program will also allow students who arrive early to participate in an escape room. These escape rooms, which engage players by providing them with a series of clues and puzzles to complete an objective, will enable new students to quickly form relationships with each other and create a more cohesive atmosphere.
“I want them to have a great time, and see me as a role model and a resource,” David said. “I’m very excited.”

Last week, a leaked draft of the Trump administration’s proposed policies on preventative healthcare presented young college-age women with an unsettling revelation: Their access to birth control via the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate could soon be slashed.
According to the draft, the contraceptive mandate’s guarantees could be dramatically scaled back in a misguided effort to defend religious freedom. The policy will allow any employer, including colleges and health insurance companies, to seek exemption from providing insurance plans that offer birth control to female employees on moral or religious grounds.
But the move to placate religious groups that have been protesting the mandate for years is about more than just religious liberty. It signals a step toward dismantling public access to contraception altogether. This is a dangerous scenario for young women of limited economic means across the country — one that will disproportionately affect young women pursuing a college education — as public funding for women’s health organizations like Planned Parenthood faces serious threats.
It may be that most women attending college aren’t employed on a full-time basis, and thus, aren’t on an employer-provided insurance plan anyway. Nonetheless, the contraceptive mandate has allowed 67 percent of insured women to have access to free birth control. It is this access to birth control that allows young women to exert control over their bodies, giving them the freedom to pursue education or a career and put off having a family.
Simultaneously, roughly 80 percent of Planned Parenthood’s millions of nationwide patients receive contraceptive means through the women’s health organization, and are able to do so for free due to reimbursements from Medicaid that the organization receives. However, a bill recently signed into law by President Trump will allow states to withhold federal funding from the organization simply because it provides abortion services, even though no federal funding is appropriated to these services. This could result in the shutdown of local clinics that female college students across the country rely on to safely access care, and young women’s ability to access free birth control and crucial sexual health education could dwindle as a result of this.
Access to reproductive justice is, in no uncertain terms, an issue that affects college women arguably more than any other group. Many young women who have the privilege of pursuing higher education are financially dependent on parents whose sexual values may differ from those of their children, and who may be unwilling to financially support their children’s access to resources, such as contraceptives, that make bodily autonomy possible.
And of course, there is no denying that bodily autonomy for young women is what makes higher education possible. For generations, young women of reproductive age were barred from attending college and pursuing careers because the inaccessibility of birth control and abortion cemented their roles as mothers and household caretakers at a young age.
Today, this makes confidential and comprehensive insurance plans as well as access to publicly funded women’s health organizations all the more crucial, lest society run the risk of undoing generations of progress.
This latest attack on the contraceptive mandate could become effective as soon as the policy receives approval from the Federal Office of Management and Budget. The religious liberty exemption has been widely criticized by many civil liberties and women’s rights groups that point out that prioritizing Christian values over a woman’s right to bodily autonomy is unconstitutional, and ironically marks a violation of women’s right to religious liberty.
After all, it seems worth reminding opponents of birth control access and the contraceptive mandate that religious freedom refers to individual rights to expression, as opposed to forcing others to live according to one’s individual beliefs. At the same time, objective academic studies continue to reveal the large-scale economic benefits to broadening birth control access. In this sense, it seems that in failing to protect the rights and dignities of women of reproductive age, the federal government could also be neglecting societal progress as a whole.
USC’s convenient location in downtown Los Angeles makes access to free or affordable birth control at Planned Parenthood or other women’s health clinics a short ride away, but for students who may lack the resources to conveniently leave campus, access to birth control at the Engemann Student Health Center could be more complicated, and could largely depend on students’ family insurance plans.
In a unique climate where mounting challenges to public access to birth control run parallel to mounting support for over-the-counter birth control pills, USC must do its part to connect students of all socioeconomic backgrounds to the resources they need to be on an equal playing field with their male peers, who do not face the same financial or medical burdens on their bodies, and subsequently their futures. In failing to secure access to such resources, the University runs the risk of losing a range of academic talent among its population of female students.
Fact: From 28th and Serverance, the epicenter for the USC student population, health care at Planned Parenthood at 30th and Flower is closer than health care in Engemann at 1031 w. 34th.

In a politically divisive climate, college campuses have come to reflect the polarizing political and racial attitudes in the United States. Last year, The Atlantic reported that student engagement and political activism are at an all-time high among college and high school students, with a 2.9 percentage growth of a student having a “very good chance” of participating in a protest. 
However, the rise of student activism disproportionately represents all student opinions, which has led to the suppression of speech and ideas by the majority: left-wing students. The protests at the University of California, Berkeley against conservative speakers Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos and, most recently, the riots at Evergreen State College demonstrate the one-sidedness of students’ political engagement and the detrimental effects of silencing opposing political viewpoints.
Annually, Evergreen hosts the Day of Absence and the Day of Presence. Evergreen’s website states that the two-day event aims to address current racial issues on its campus and beyond. This year, however, Evergreen erupted in a student protest because of a racial dispute on the Day of Absence,  according to the Cooper Point Journal. The event is a day in which white students and faculty were invited to leave campus for the activity. Biology professor Bret Weinstein spoke out against the forceful and oppressive tactic used by the student group. In an e-mail to one of the event’s organizers, Weinstein stated that these decisions are “an act of oppression, in and of itself” and did not participate in the Day of Absence by staying and teaching on campus.
In response to his actions, dozens of student protesters interrupted his class, demanding his apology and resignation. Although Weinstein initially attempted to have a civil discussion with the students regarding his decision to not participate in the Day of Absence, they shouted him down seeking one thing and one thing only: his resignation or firing. The students’ claim that Weinstein’s inaction and views toward the Day of Absence are racist.
Unfortunately, the incident at Evergreen showcases the biased mentality of left-wing college students across the country: Many are quick to dismiss outspoken ideas that do not align with their own beliefs. It is critical for university students to engage in open and free discourse of ideas to showcase the most important and substantive form of diversity: intellectual diversity and diversity of  opinion.
Higher education should not be a safe space meant to coddle and reaffirm students’ sociopolitical beliefs and values. Rather, college should be an open arena for intellectually honest debates on key issues facing the world. If students continue to blatantly disregard opposing opinions, they will become confined to an echo chamber of ideas with no solution to real world problems. Students must learn to critically analyze and understand others’ perspectives to effectively engage in substantial change in the social and political arenas.
Disappointingly, in recent months, several speaker events on campuses have been shut down due to disruptive protests and violence. From Ben Shapiro’s speech at CSU Los Angeles to Richard Spencer’s event at Auburn University, there is growing prevalence of student-motivated protests encouraging the suppression of the free speech of challenging — and often political — viewpoints. However, free speech, along with the acknowledgement of opposing opinions, remain crucial on college campuses. No student or group of students should have the right to ban or prevent a speaker from hosting a discussion on a college campus.
Although student opinion provides valuable input and diversity onto a campus community, protesting a speaker — especially one that presents certain political alignments — oversteps a student’s right to free speech. These protests come at the cost of stifling other students’ speech, ideas and opinions, and these students’ perspectives are usually in the minority. Activism and engagement on campus should strive to represent the beliefs of all students: A majority group should not hold the right to dictate their opinions and unjustifiably project it by demanding compliance from the entire student body. This behavior tramples on students’ right to free speech by determining that free speech only matters if a certain opinion goes along with it.
The riots at Evergreen is the latest casualty to the overwhelming left-wing opinions represented on college campuses, and students’ disregard for any conflicting opinions. Rather than acknowledge others’ arguments, students ostracize those who speak out against them: intimidating and labeling individuals as racist, xenophobic, homophobic, sexist. The bottom line is that what Weinstein did was right and in no way did he deserve the students’ treatment. Students at Evergreen State College (or any college, for that matter) have no right to force students of a particular racial group off of a college campus for the sake of empowerment. As Weinstein wrote, “On a college campus, one’s right to speak — or to be — must never be based on skin color.”
The Left (particularly the alt-Left) is interested in diversity of colour, but not diversity of opinion.  They preach tolerance, until you disagree with them.
It’s refreshing to read an op ed piece by a student at USC that is open and honest and not biased towards the propaganda of the Left.  Open and honest communication where folks are not shouted down in a necessity on campuses today, but unfortunately, these radicalized kids are as dangerous as any socialist army or propagandist.  Shutting down our freedom of speech is the first of our Constitutional rights that the Left is working towards eliminating.  Thanks Max.  Fight On!

It is almost officially summertime and the living should be easy, but sometimes (for some of us) money can be tight. Luckily for those in Southern California this summer, Santa Monica’s annual “Twilight Concerts” will return and will be free to the public. Santa Monica’s annual summer concerts tradition first started in 1983 to bring awareness to the pier’s reconstruction after one-third of it was destroyed by winter storms. The city has kept the tradition ever since, making it a prominent part of the culture of Southern California.
The concert series is hosted by the nonprofit Santa Monica Pier Corporation and sponsored by the popular mobile application company Snapchat. If Snapchat replicates the activities they had at the concerts last year, expect free giveaways and fun-filled interactive Snapchat events during the concert.
Each concert will run on a Thursday night from June 20 to Aug. 17 (except for July 6), with the concert going from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Some concert-goers prefer to get there well before the concert begins to enjoy quality time at the beach and set up a picnic with friends before the show starts.
 Each week will celebrate a different popular music genre and will be hosted by media partners KCRW’s disc jockeys. The impressive lineup ranges from up-and-coming artists with recent commercial success, like Khalid and Coast Modern, to seasoned artists including Irma Thomas and Eric Burdon & The Animals. 
The impressive, diverse lineup is guaranteed to bring in large crowds from different walks of life. The series kicks off with Khalid and Bibi Bourelly. Khalid is a rising, contemporary R&B and soul artist whose hit single “Location” has already reached over 60 million views on YouTube since it was released in Aug. 2016. Grammy Award-winning singer Irma Thomas (also known as the “Soul Queen of New Orleans”) and the harmonic, all-girl indie rock band Warpaint are sure to provide an outstanding, soulful experience for the attendees. 
Hailing from Kingston, Jamaica, with an impressive resume including singing with Bob Marley and the Wailers for seven years, Marcia Griffiths is an electrifying performer. Veteran British rock group Eric Burdon & The Animals’ version of American folk song, “House of the Rising Sun,” is a classic and if they choose to perform it, you’ll want to be there. Other buzzy acts will include local indie-pop duo Coast Modern, LeMaitre and Australia’s own Miami Horror.
Since a big crowd is expected, early arrival is suggested for each of the concerts. The Twilight Concerts is located at 200 Santa Monica Pier. More suggestions and transit information can be found on Santa Monica Pier’s website.
Thanks, Snapchat.  Please ruin the Westside more with more intoxicated crowds milling around downtown Santa Monica.  How about some more annoying Millennial tech workers on motorscooters?

When pop sensation Halsey first stepped onto the music scene with her debut album Badlands, she exhibited the beginnings of an impactful and lasting talent within the music industry. She broke ground with “New Americana,” which has since been deemed by publications such as The New York Times and Billboard Magazine, as a “generational anthem.” Since then, a loyal fan base stretching across all platforms of social media have anxiously awaited the release of her second album.
With 16 songs totaling 48 minutes, hopeless fountain kingdom is a piece of synth-pop perfection with a dark and haunting twist. It is a step forward from Badlands, which was criticized for its lack of originality and hollow sound. For hopeless fountain kingdom, she enlisted a team of notable co-writers, such as The Weeknd and hitmaker Sia. Along with her natural songwriting talent, her co-writers and producers helped elevate her music. However, Halsey’s album still lacks the authenticity to elevate her from newcomer to pop veteran.
The first track on hopeless fountain kingdom is “The Prologue.” In the track, Halsey recites lines from Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. After a short pause, the song transitions to an electronic beat, with Halsey singing “I am a child of a money hungry, prideful country.” She then continues to say, “hands so bloody taste like honey / I’m finding it hard to leave.” These prove to be some the most powerful lyrics on the album, providing personal commentary about her life as a byproduct of greed and pride. This type of self-reflection is a theme throughout the entire album. 
In a tweet about her album, Halsey stated that although hopeless fountain kingdom is about a breakup, she wanted to make sure the album was more about herself and her emotions. Her ability to self-reflect through songwriting is one of the highlights of her sophomore album, as she used pop music to illuminate some of her more dark and personal thoughts. hopeless foundation kingdom touches on familiar musical tropes and on paper, contains all the elements to make successful commercial pop singles, as well as a successful commercial pop album. 
However, many musical elements in this album seemed to be inspired by other contemporary artists. “Eyes Closed” is reminiscent of Selena Gomez in Revival. “Heaven in Hiding” contains similar elements to Lana Del Rey’s “Dark Paradise” and “Now or Never” resembles Rihanna’s “Needed Me.” The album is lacking an originality, or a signature that is uniquely Halsey, and in turn, each song in the album sounds like it could be done by someone else and better. This makes the album predictable and boring, but the familiarity is, perhaps, what makes this album so comfortable to listen to.
The only distinctive and near original component about Halsey’s music is her voice. In the album, Halsey sounds more comfortable with her singing. Her vocal performances on the tracks “Sorry” and “Devil in Me” showcase her vocal improvement since Badlands. 
The highlights of this album are “The Prologue,” an eclectic but strong introduction to hopeless fountain kingdom; “Alone,” an uptempo song mixed with cliché lyrics and infectious R&B chorus; and “Strangers,” a stunning duet between Halsey and Fifth Harmony’s Lauren Jauregui. “Good Morning” contains some of the strongest lines in the album: “There’s a place where love conquers all / A city with the streets full of milk and honey.” The song serves as an effective and effortless prelude to “Lie,” a dramatic piano ballad featuring an auto-tuned verse from Migos’ Quavo.   
Despite its lack of originality, hopeless fountain kingdom remains poised to be one of the biggest commercial pop releases of the year. Each track sounds as if heavy thought was placed into its production, which, although gives it a highly calculated feel, assures there are no throw-away tracks on this album. With this album, Halsey has solidified herself as a pop star, whose career can go anywhere she chooses from this point.

Among the many eclectic storefronts at the University CityWalk, one particular shop has caught the attention of visitors across Southern California and all around the world. With a hot pink exterior and a giant replica of its signature Voodoo Doll doughnut, Voodoo Doughnut stands out as one of the newest additions to Los Angeles’ dessert scene. 
Founded by co-owners and long-time friends Richard “Tres” Shannon and Kenneth “Cat Daddy” Pogson, Voodoo Doughnut took the world by storm when the first shop opened in Portland, Ore. in 2003. With more than 60 wacky and outlandish flavors such “Grape Ape,” “Maple Blazer Blunt” and “Butterfingering,” the establishment soon grew to popularity as shops continued to open across Oregon and in both Denver, Col. and Austin, Tex. 
 However, the shop’s success did not come solely from its origins in downtown Portland. Shannon and Pogson’s conception of Voodoo Doughnut became a reality after they went South to master the art of making doughnuts at a three-day camp in Pico Rivera, Calif. Through their training, they also brought the iconic pink doughnut boxes back to Oregon and coined their slogan: “Good things come in pink boxes!”
“We learned to make doughnuts in Pico Rivera, and our doughnut culture started here,” Pogson said. “Since the beginning, we wanted to have a triumphant return to [Los Angeles].”
In April, Voodoo Doughnut officially opened its seventh location at the Universal CityWalk in north Los Angeles. Though having been in business for less three months, the shop has already garnered major traction on social media from fans and foodies — rivaling the hype of famous L.A. establishments such as California Donuts, Sidecar Doughnuts & Coffee and DK Donuts. 
Although its exterior is markedly different from that of other locations, L.A.’s Voodoo Doughnut remains true to its brand with aesthetic elements like the bizarre decor, the fun pink walls and the colorfully tiled floors. In addition, the shop also features a signature pink coffee brewer with coffee served from one of Portland’s most popular coffee brewers Stumptown. What makes this Voodoo Doughnut even more remarkable is its mission to celebrate the wacky theme and colorful confections that brought it to fame. 
 “Voodoo Doughnuts is supposed to be fun,” Shannon said. “There are bad connotations to the term ‘voodoo,’ but voodoo goes both ways. Voodoo is fun and exciting — and we want to emulate that into the doughnuts that we make.”
 The shop is also committed to its tradition of officiating weddings at the L.A. location. Though there has not yet been a wedding officiated, Pogson noted that he will work personally to plan and officiate the ceremony when the first wedding occurs at Voodoo Doughnut. 
 Though Voodoo Doughnut is known for its long lines, Pogson and Shannon both reassure that the wait time at its newest shop will be no longer than 40 minutes. 
“Come and see the magic,” Pogson said. “Take it all in when you visit Voodoo Doughnut.”

For Steve Johnson, the 2017 French Open was as much an emotional battle as a physical one. The 27-year-old USC alumnus, ranked No. 25 in the world, showed up to Roland Garros this year with a heavy heart following the passing of his father. Johnson’s father, a respected tennis coach in Orange County, passed away unexpectedly at the age of 58 less than a month before the start of the tournament.
“I know it’s going to be emotional for quite some time,”  Johnson said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times ahead of the French Open. “Who knows how long it’ll take? I just know he’s with me. He raised me to be a competitor and a fighter to the last point, and that’s what I try to do with my tennis.”
In his first match at Roland Garros, Johnson took on Japan’s Yuichi Sugita in what proved to be a tough first-round matchup. Ranked No. 78 in the world, Sugita trailed 2-1 when the match was delayed due to weather. After it was all said and done, Johnson prevailed in a five-set, 3.5 hour-long match by a score of 6-3, 6-3, 6-7(4), 6-7(3), 6-3. Johnson broke Sugita’s serve twice in the fifth set to send him to a matchup with Croatia’s Borna Coric in the next round. 
Johnson’s second match was another grueling test of the American’s will. In a four hour-long emotional roller coaster, Johnson topped Coric 6-2, 7-6 (8), 3-6, 7-6 (6). But Johnson’s triumph didn’t come until after four lost match points and a controversial ball abuse call. Coric was one point away from forcing a fifth set twice until Johnson hit a forehand winner. 
Overcome with emotion, Johnson dropped to his knees in triumph, while Coric smashed his racquet on Roland Garros’ famous clay court. In an emotional post-match interview, Johnson, with tears in his eyes, admitted, “Physically, I’m OK. Emotionally, I’m a mess.”
“[My father] always wanted me to be a fighter and a competitor so that’s what I’m going to do, day in and day out,” Johnson said. “That’s the only thing I can do.”
Johnson said it was impossible to hold in his emotions any longer against Coric.
“The other days, I was able to kind of get to the locker room and kind of compose myself a little bit,” he said. “Today was just such an emotional match — a long match, up and down. Just to get through it was something that I know I’ll be very proud of.”
Physically and emotionally drained from his matches against Sugita and Coric, Johnson then lost to
sixth-ranked Dominic Thiem of Austria 6-1, 7-6 (4), 6-3. Johnson put up an honorable fight after a slow start, but he was unable to upset the talented Thiem. 
Johnson, now ranked No. 26 in the world, won the admiration of not only fans, but also his competition. After the match, Thiem complimented his opponent.
“It’s really [a] tragedy what happened. You wish it on nobody, especially him,” Thiem said. “It was, of course, very emotional for him. It also shows that there are way more important things than tennis. I think it was unbelievably tough for him to even play here.”
Johnson is making waves in professional tennis after an outstanding Trojan career. He departed USC with a 72-match win streak to close out his collegiate record, and he won the NCAA Singles Championship in 2011 and 2012 in addition to winning national team championships during all four seasons. He was also a seven-time All-American and won a host of ITA and conference awards. Since his graduation, Johnson has made more than a dozen Grand Slam appearances and secured his first trip to the Summer Olympics for Team USA in 2016.

After a successful, Rose Bowl-winning 2016 season, kickoff times for five of USC’s 2017 football games are officially set. USC is currently riding a nine-game win streak and finished last season ranked third in the nation.
The Trojans start this season with three consecutive home games. Though the team lost key components to the NFL Draft over the offseason, such as cornerback Adoree’ Jackson and wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, the team will return a combined 14 starters. The veteran core will play an important role all season, especially during the three-game homestand that begins what could be a promising season.
USC kicks off the season with an early afternoon, 2:15 p.m. game against the Western Michigan Broncos on September 2, on the Pac-12 network.  The Broncos are coming off a season in which they finished 13-1. The team’s sole loss came after it secured a well-earned berth in the Cotton Bowl, during which it fell just short against Wisconsin.
That game will be followed by two more home contests, set for 5:30 p.m. kickoffs on FOX.  First up is a Pac-12 game against rival Stanford on Sept. 9, as USC looks to snap a three-game losing streak to the Cardinal.
The following week, the Trojans host Texas under new head coach Tom Herman on Sept. 16. It’ll be the first time the Longhorns play USC at the Coliseum in 40 years — and the first time the two programs square off since the famous 2005 BCS National Championship Game, in which the Trojans fell just short of a third consecutive national title in a last-minute heartbreaker. The Trojans will then play Washington State on the road at 7:30 p.m. on Sept. 29, which will be aired on ESPN.
The start time for USC’s annual crosstown rivalry game against UCLA has not been set yet, but the Trojans do have a game time for Notre Dame, who they’ll play on the road this fall. That game will kick off on Oct. 21 at 7:30 p.m. on NBC.  USC’s remaining seven games will have their kickoff times revealed roughly a week or two before game day.
When will USC step up and tell the Pac-12 Commissioner that they will not play short schedule travel games, not 7L30pm games.  No one back east, where most of the sports writers live are going to watch a live broadcast at 10:30pm on a Saturday night.  As with the NCAA sanctions, USC doesn’t show any determination to control their destiny with the NCAA and the Pac-12.  USC should seriously reconsider going independent for football, and stay in the Pac-12 for the other sports.

Last weekend, the USC baseball team concluded a challenging season, losing its eighth straight Pac-12 series to Washington. For the second straight year, the Trojans are at home for the NCAA Tournament, thus forcing some difficult questions about head coach Dan Hubbs’ job security and the program’s vitality going forward. 
When USC finished second place in the conference and made the NCAA Regionals in 2015, Hubbs was awarded a multi-year contract extension. After years of mediocrity, the program finally appeared to be on track. Articles titled “Dan Hubbs has been a hit as USC baseball coach” and “How Dan Hubbs changed culture of USC baseball” flooded the internet, and the coach seemed to herald a new era of USC baseball dominance. Now, just two years later, the landscape looks a lot different. 
In the wake of Hubbs’ worst conference finish since becoming head coach in 2013 (tied for last place in the conference with an 8-22 Pac-12 record), USC is once again at a crossroads. The easy explanation for this year’s season-long slump was a massive exodus of talent that occurred at last year’s MLB draft, where the Trojans had a program-record 12 players selected. Even with all of those star players on the roster, however, USC still finished 28-28 and failed to make the tournament in 2016. 
Despite the departures of many star players including catcher Jeremy Martinez and outfielder Timmy Robinson at the end of last season, the Trojans boasted their fair share of hitting talent this spring. Sophomore Lars Nootbaar (.313, 7 HR) and junior Frankie Rios (.354, 26 RBI) were both All-Pac-12 selections, while junior Adalberto Carrillo and sophomore Brandon Perez were named as honorable mentions. All four anchored a lineup that was stronger than the team’s record suggested. The group finished sixth in the conference for team batting average (.273), total hits (518) and home runs (33).
The batting order’s glaring weakness, however, was capitalizing on scoring opportunities, as they were eighth in RBIs (245) and runs scored (272) with runners in scoring position. USC had plenty of games like its season finale against Washington — a 7-4 loss — where the Trojans were able to outhit their opponents, yet could not convert those hits into enough runs. With much of its order likely returning next season, the team will need to work on leaving fewer runners stranded to maximize its offensive potential.
Unlike the batting order, USC’s pitching stats accurately reflected the team’s plight this year. The young and inexperienced rotation (only two pitchers started more than two games in 2016) never quite found its footing, as the staff finished with the second worst team ERA (5.56) in the Pac-12 while giving up the second-most hits (542). There will be no easy fix for a bullpen that never found any semblance of consistency. Five pitchers started more than five games, but only one of them, freshman Chris Clarke, had a winning record. While the group will enter 2018 with more experience, they will need to make drastic changes for next year’s team to improve to a winning record. 
There are a few positives to take into next season, especially if the core of the batting order returns. But with Hubbs now firmly on the hot seat after two straight disappointing seasons, the Trojans are in need of a significant turnaround. And so, after a false dawn of sorts, the quest to put the program back on the map continues. 
Hey Trevor, good analysis of the season in short form. Big question for the offense will Rios and Carrillo return for their senior year? The pitching staff was a mess all season. Mitch Hart injury and Marrick Crouse have not come close to their hype entering USC. The freshmen pitchers fell apart latter part of the schedule. Solomon Bates was a find at the end. The problem is Hubbs strength is pitching , and it has floundered for two years now. The fact that the team could only finish at .500 in 2016 with all the talent, and the terrible season just concluded makes no sense to keep him as head coach. Swann got rid of Cynthia Cooper for women basketball who had a better season than baseball. Maybe there will be magic in numbers with the Trojan winning the national title in 1978 then 20 years later in 1998 , and now it will be 20 years later in 2018.

Last offseason, junior quarterback Max Browne was ready for his full Trojan debut after sitting behind three-year starter Cody Kessler. A redshirt freshman quarterback named Sam Darnold performed well in summer camp, but Browne, a former five-star prospect, got the nod on opening day against Alabama.
USC then stumbled to a 1-2 record under Browne, resulting in head coach Clay Helton’s decision to turn to Darnold.
With a calm, unassuming expression on his face throughout the ups and downs of games, Darnold was almost playing in his backyard as he led the Trojans to nine consecutive wins, including their first Rose Bowl victory since 2009. His knack for making critical plays at crucial times has thrust him into the spotlight in Los Angeles and beyond.
”Personnel executives have spent the last month or so watching a ton of tape,” NFL analyst Daniel Jeremiah said in March. “When you’re studying draft-eligible defenders against USC, [Darnold] jumps off the screen. He only has one year of college playing experience, but he’s clearly captured the attention of NFL evaluators.”
While Darnold is the glue that binds his team together, the Trojans lost 11 starters from last year, most notably wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and defensive back Adoree’ Jackson. 
With Jackson gone, junior cornerback Iman Marshall will have the opportunity to establish himself as the No. 1 corner, and sophomore cornerback Jack Jones will work to build off a freshman year during which he got his feet wet as a backup. Freshmen Je’Quari Godfrey and Greg Johnson will also join the fray.
In addition to Smith-Schuster, Darnold also lost key wide receivers in De’Quan Hampton and Darreus Rogers to the NFL Draft. But junior Deontay Burnett will return after scoring seven touchdowns in 2016 — including the late game-tying score in the Rose Bowl — and amassing 56 receptions for 622 receiving yards.
Redshirt senior receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. will return from an ACL injury, and incoming five-star wide receiver Joseph Lewis will compete with a host of redshirt freshmen at the position. Redshirt junior Jalen Greene (8 receptions, 116 yards in 2016) and sophomore Michael Pittman (6 receptions, 82 yards in 2016) figure to see more balls thrown their way as part of a talented receiving corps.
But Helton has always emphasized the running game, and USC is stacked at the tailback position. Leading rusher junior Ronald Jones II should get most of the carries, and the crew only got stronger with the addition of a five-star recruit in freshman Stephen Carr. 
The offensive line, contrastingly, will lose a wealth of experience after core players moved on to the NFL: ex-starting tackles Chad Wheeler and Zach Banner, as well as former guard Damien Mama. Austin Jackson and Alijah Vera-Tucker, four-star recruits and freshman offensive tackles, are among those who will provide extra strength to the current roster.
There are also questions surrounding who will step up on the interior defensive line with Stevie Tu’ikolovatu now fighting for a spot on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Redshirt senior defensive tackle Kenny Bigelow Jr. is back from injury. Freshmen Jay Tufele and Marlon Tuipulotu will look to factor into the competitive group.
At linebacker, Cameron Smith and Porter Gustin are the headlining playmakers. Smith, however, is suspended for the first half of the Western Michigan game, stemming from his ejection in the Rose Bowl due to a targeting penalty. Sophomore linebacker Jordan Iosefa seems like the probable replacement at the MIKE position.
The Trojans’ X-factor next season may come at tight end, where they have no shortage of size and catching ability. Helton managed to sign two notables, 6-foot-5 Josh Falo and 6-foot-6 Erik Krommenhoek, in his last recruiting class.
