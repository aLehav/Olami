After two days of competition at the U.S Collegiate Championship at The Golf Club of Georgia in Aplharetta, Ga., USC sits in second place, scoring a 9-under-par 567.

After a solid first day where the Trojans hit an even-par 288 and ended up in fourth place, USC returned with a vengeance, scoring 9-under-par as a team and rocketing to second in the field. USC is 11 strokes behind leader Georgia Tech, despite besting the Yellow Jackets by six strokes in the second round.
Junior Steve Lim has been the star for USC this tournament, firing back-to-back 3-under-par 69 rounds to earn himself a tie for second place in the 78-man field, just six strokes back from first. Lim had a dominant second round, scoring five birdies and two bogeys in the best effort the Trojans have seen this year.
Next for the Trojans is sophomore T.J. Vogel. Vogel has consistently played well this season and continued that trend through the first two rounds, shooting a 2-over-par 74 followed by a 3-under-par 69 to land in a tie for ninth place at 1-under-par 143. Vogel bounced back from a tough first round to make one eagle, four birdies and three bogeys in a strong second round that elevated him from 28th place to his current ninth.
“I was a little out of rhythm [Sunday],” Vogel said. “But I worked really hard this morning to get one going. [Monday] was much easier. I was able to control my ball flight and get a lot of great shots.”
Third for USC is freshman Jeffrey Kang.
Kang held on to an even par score for most of his second round, starting off with two bogeys and two birdies but recorded four bogeys in the last six holes, ending up at 4-over-par 76 on the day.
Kang’s first round, however, was the best seen from him all year; Kang kept up with veteran Lim to shoot a 3-under-par 69, and a return to form in the third round isn’t out of the picture.
Kang is tied for 14th place, just two strokes behind Vogel.
Newcomer Ramsey Sahyoun is next for the Trojans, sitting in a tie for 23rd place.
After a tough debut round where he shot 5-over-par 77 for 55th place, Sahyoun rallied for an impressive 3-under-par 69 in round two. Sayhoun made three birdies and two bogeys before earning an eagle on the last hole.
Vogel was impressed with Sahyoun’s debut.
“[Sunday] was his first college start, but he was still able to go out and post a decent score,” Vogel said. “[Monday] seemed very comfortable. He hit a lot of great shots and made his putts.”
Rounding out the Trojan squad is sophomore Sam Smith.
Smith is in a tie for 33rd place at 4-over-par 148. Smith hit for an even-par 72 in a turbulent round two, matching four birdies with four bogeys.
Smith fired a 4-over-par 76 in round one.
This tournament marks the first time this season that the Trojans have been either par or under par as a team. They hope to continue the good play today to attempt to gain the lead.
“We’ve got to go out and try to do our thing [today], try to go low and make a run at Georgia Tech.” Vogel said.
Action concludes today with the final round of play.

Once you get your feet wet in the publishing business, the possibilities are endless. For Audrey Niffenegger, one genre is not enough. The author penned The Time Traveler’s Wife and Her Fearful Symmetry, both of which show her ability to craft haunting moods and a knack for compelling imagery.
Sequential art · The Night Bookmobile is Audrey Niffenegger’s first foray in comics, having written prose such as The Time Traveler’s Wife. - Photo courtesy of Abrams ComicArts 
But her latest work comes in the form of a graphic novel that she illustrated herself. Instead of creating intricate images from the lacing of words, The Night Bookmobile allows Niffenegger to put pen to paper and draw the surroundings of her story along with crafting the idea itself.
Although it is intended for an audience just shy of its preteen years, the book has a seemingly adult narrative. It provides a deep philosophical journey into the complexities of the mind but also showcases a strange semi-lucid mindset in which the narrator is perhaps a little loony.
The graphic novel begins at four in the morning; after yet another argument with her boyfriend, the protagonist Alexandra stumbles upon a Winnebago filled with all the books she’s read in her life. From there, the story takes an unexpectedly despondent turn.
Niffenegger’s greatest success is the development Alexandra, who can now come to life in illustrations.
The young woman obviously leads an unstable life, detailing her dysfunctional relationship at the beginning of the novel; this instability only continues as Niffenneger shows her obsessing and even crying over the night bookmobile.
Niffenneger’s drawing skills are not remarkable — in fact, the pictures border on slightly crude, though to the point, ensconcing the reader in the story just as her novels do. The tale itself was originally published as short fiction in Zoetrope All-Story in 2004, based on a dream Niffenegger had years ago.
Despite the ethereal inspiration for the graphic novel, she does not use fantastical, other-worldly images — the illustrations remain ordinary as the story creates a complex journey.
The characters and surroundings are relatively normal, which lets the story stand alone. This draws attention away from the illustrations, which serve mostly to accentuate the story rather than give it form.
In true graphic novel fashion, Niffenegger experiments with the reader’s point of view, juxtaposing images to show two characters at the same time, focusing on facial expressions and creating a scene with small images surrounding one another. The narrative unfurls in pale yellow boxes sometimes superimposed on the images while other scenes show a simpler white text.
Interestingly enough, the author uses her words to supplement the images as well. An ordinary scene of the Winnebago leaving becomes a fascinating image with her description of it as “a large egg sliding slowly through the body of a snake.”
Despite Niffennegger’s investment in illustration, the author still conjures up the power of the written word to express what perhaps cannot be illustrated. At times, the words help bolster the images, at other times the reader’s imagination takes over with help from the prose.
Despite some confusion over whether Niffenegger believes more in the power of the written word or of the image, the story itself remains cleverly mystical. The premise is simple and lacks much action but somehow manages to keep the reader enthralled. It is a dreary account of what at first seems a fantastical journey.
It is the outlining of Alexandra’s dream world in the midst of reality — and as the author puts it, a haunting tale about something that seems far from dangerous.
In her afterword, Niffenneger describes the story as “a cautionary tale of the seductions of the written word.”
Though at times overly simple, the stark images within the book lend the story its eerie mood. The graphic novel hardly offers any complex images for the readers to find themselves spellbound. What keeps everything together is the manner in which the simple images allow the reader to follow Alexandra and wonder what will happen next.
One page shows a completely orange background, Alexandra’s head bowed with obvious emotion and a large box of text to the side of her. Niffenegger presents simple drawings yet successfully communicates the subtle emotions of Alexandra.
In the end, the graphic novel offers an engrossing, offbeat story and honest drawings. The story brings a haunting quality to the notion of getting absorbed in books, perfectly summed up in Niffenegger’s afterword.
“What would you sacrifice to sit in that comfy chair with perfect light for an afternoon in eternity, reading the perfect book, forever?”

The Trojans returned to practice a day early to get a head start on preparation for what many say is the biggest and most anticipated game of the season against No. 1 Oregon. Everyone recognizes the importance of this game, from the walk-ons to the experts at College GameDay.
Going up · Sophomore cornerback T.J. McDonald leaps to intercept a pass in practice. The USC defense has prepared for the last week to face Oregon’s high-speed offense that currently ranks second in the nation. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
USC coach Lane Kiffin, in an attempt to shore up USC’s tackling issues before facing the fast-paced Oregon offense, instituted a number of tackling drills for the linebackers and secondary. He has identified tackling as the weakness of the team thus far.
“If we could tackle at all in the secondary, we’d be 7-0 right now,” Kiffin said.
Redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo understood the importance of the drills as well, emphasizing that the team has to be able to adjust to what the game plan calls for.
“The tackling drills caught us by surprise, but if that’s what the week calls for, then that’s what we have to do,” Galippo said. “Having coach Kiffin watch the drills also added a different level of intensity to it. We knew he was watching [the linebackers.]”
—
A lot of the talk around practice was about the tempo of Oregon’s “blur” offense. Oregon’s average time of possession is 26:40, 114th in the country. The Ducks lead the nation, however, with an average 55.1 points per game. Kiffin discussed the tempo of the Oregon offense, saying he “has never seen a team play with that tempo.”
“They are at a whole other level,” he said.
Despite the Ducks’ speed, sophomore safety T.J. McDonald said the team will be prepared for Oregon’s offense and special teams.
“We’ll definitely be ready. The big thing for us is just getting lined up and being on all of our assignments,” McDonald said.
Redshirt sophomore defensive end Wes Horton echoed that statement.
“We are ready. We have the best coaches to help us game plan. [Oregon] lines up in pretty simple formations. They can be stopped. Hopefully, we have a great week of preparation and we’ll be ready for Saturday,” Horton said.
—
A lot of players returned to practice on Monday, including Horton. Senior tailback Allen Bradford and senior center Kristofer O’Dowd also practiced Monday after being sidelined last week.
“It was good to get some guys back, but we’re obviously not at 100 percent,” Kiffin said.
Senior tailback C.J. Gable and freshman tailback Dillon Baxter sat out practice, giving Bradford and redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler the bulk of the reps at the tailback position during practice. Junior tackle Tyron Smith was limited.

Plenty of hand-holding harmony occurred in the soon-to-be Pac-12 over the weekend, with the divisional split and revenue-sharing agreement set to take effect next season.
California has been split in two, but the rivalries have been maintained. Your annual Weekender plans are safe.
It was also decided that revenue from television contracts is going to be shared equally among all 12 teams. Whoever said socialism couldn’t work?
But with the conference of the future done posing for its smiling front-page photo op, it’s time to get back to business. The lame duck Pac-10 is in the middle of its final conference race.
Speaking of ducks (but certainly not lame ones), you might have heard about Oregon, No. 1 in the human polls and No. 2 in that other poll that college football somehow lets determine who plays for the national title.
Oregon visits the Coliseum this weekend in what is USC’s absolute last chance to stay relevant in conference competition this season. Even more importantly, this could become a season-defining win for a USC team that somehow seems to have momentum despite being 1-2 in its last three games.
But if you’ve watched the Ducks for even five minutes this year, you’ll understand the challenge the Trojans face. USC coach Lane Kiffin is trying to prepare his defense for 100 plays against Oregon — and he’s not kidding.
Oregon destroys opponents by being in better shape. Its defense gave up points in the fourth quarter for the first time against UCLA last week, but it was a meaningless touchdown that came with less than two minutes remaining.
The key to beating the Ducks is limiting their offense enough and tiring out their defense. Obviously, their team is in great shape. But their defense is good, not great, and it is vulnerable to fatigue with the offense moving on and off the field so quickly.
It’s because of this that Oregon’s defense has looked questionable at times. But with the offense playing so well, it’s been hard to notice.
The only times the Ducks looked beatable was against Stanford when they fell behind 21-3 and against Arizona State when they were down 24-14. Both deficits, however, were met in the first half and were quickly overcome in the second.
The way the Trojans have played offense this season, they should be able to score plenty. But plenty against Oregon is not good enough unless USC’s defense can at least limit the Ducks. If the Trojans can hold Oregon in the 35-point range, they have a chance. No joke.
As much of a long shot as it is, USC, which is 2-2 in Pac-10 play, would still be in the running for a share of the conference title. In a season defined by sanctions, however, conference titles are of little value if you can’t take them with you to the postseason.
The pre-Halloween showdown between the Trojans and the Ducks will be about more than trophies. USC will be out to prove it is still relevant, not simply the ghost of the conference waiting to get off probation.
Few people expect USC to win. It won’t be one of those games where Oregon stumbles in unprepared and the Trojan underdogs pull off a miracle against a sleeping giant. Even though the Trojans are not in the national title race, the Ducks will be ready. USC is still USC, and the nation will be watching.
But all the pieces are in place for an upset. A team ranked No. 1 in one of the major polls has lost the last three straight weeks. USC is better when it has something to prove.
The Trojans are also coming off a bye week, meaning they have had two weeks to watch film, two weeks to rest their injuries and two weeks to try to get in shape for what will probably be a game that feels like a marathon punctuated by sprints. A win could change the entire outlook on this season for the Trojans.
So while the new-and-improved Pac-12 stole the headlines last weekend, all eyes will now return to the Pac-10 Saturday. And if the Trojans can find a little magic, the conference could be in for one last midseason shakeup.

Monday was a triumphant day for the USC women’s tennis team as it took home both the singles and doubles championship crowns at the ITA Southwest Regional Championships.
Winning stroke · Sophomore Danielle Lao won the ITA Southwest Regional singles championship after defeating senior Maria Sanchez in the final round. The Women of Troy had five singles players and three doubles teams make it to at least the round of 32. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
Sophomore Danielle Lao defeated her fellow Trojan senior Maria Sanchez to earn the singles crown, while the team of junior Alison Ramos and sophomore Valeria Pulido came out on top in doubles.
“The whole team did great and we really stepped up this year,” Lao said. “We just swept the whole tournament, and if we look at the top of the draw it was all ’SC.”
The team started off strong in the tournament, which began Thursday and was hosted by the University of San Diego and San Diego State, with five Women of Troy making it to the round of 32 in singles after the first day of play. Three teams made it through to the round of 32 in the doubles category on opening day as well, giving USC a strong presence in the top tiers of the tournament.
“This tournament proved that hard work does pay off. This was a difficult draw with UCLA, ASU, University of Arizona and other good schools, and we ended up on top in singles and in doubles,” Ramos said. “That’s a huge confidence booster for our team, and it really makes a bold statement to other teams out there — we are going to be the team to beat.”
As the tournament progressed, top-seeded Sanchez and Lao both made it to the semifinals of the singles tournament and, after defeating their respective opponents from UCLA, found themselves facing each other in the championship round.
“When you play people from your own team you want to have fun and compete, and you know them so well that it gets you a little more nervous but it’s also more exciting,” Pulido said.
The Women of Troy were rained out in San Diego Monday, so the singles championship match was played in USC’s own Marks Stadium at 2:30 p.m. Lao came out on top with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 win over her teammate. Lao’s victory marks the end of Sanchez’s winning streak in the Southwest Regional Championships, which the senior won in 2008 and 2009.
Although it required teammates to battle it out against each other,  this Trojan-against-Trojan matchup ensured a USC sweep of the entire tournament.
Ramos and Pulido’s ultimate victory in the doubles competition occurred the day before Lao’s victory. The pair first defeated its own teammates, the pair of Sanchez and freshman Kaitlyn Christian, in the semifinals, 8-6. The two went on to overpower the Roxanne and Sierra Ellison team from host San Diego State 8-4 in the final to secure the doubles championship.
“I am so happy that Val and I won doubles. We are really intense out there and we have so much fun playing together,” Ramos said. “Our energy rubs off on each other and I think that [it was] a huge contributing factor to our victory.”
The singles and doubles champions will now prepare to compete in the USTA/ITA National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships from Nov. 4-7 in New York.
“We basically are going to be playing in one of the toughest tournaments of the whole year because there will be the best doubles teams in the country there,” Pulido said. “Ali and I see it as a challenge and we just want to play really well.”
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahah.

For the majority of college students, Halloween isn’t about candy and trick-or-treating — it’s about parties.
This weekend the Southern California public radio station KCRW is throwing one of the most exciting parties slated for the Los Angeles area: a masquerade ball.
The event, on Saturday at the Park Plaza in Downtown Los Angeles, marks KCRW’s second annual Masquerade. Last year, KCRW launched its first Halloween party, which turned out to be a big success, attracting thousands of participants. This year, KCRW has implemented new additions to make the party even better than before.
“Halloween is so much fun. Everyone gets into the spirit — especially our audience,” said Jason Bentley, executive producer of events at KCRW and a scheduled DJ for Saturday night.
Proceeds from the masquerade benefit the public station. Although tickets are a bit pricey, running at $75, the organizers have made sure that the Masquerade will be worth every penny.
The Masquerade is not like any other party; it is an overdose of colorful costumes, music and DJs. KCRW has pulled out all of the stops to satisfy partygoers when it comes to music, atmosphere and food.
Attendees get the chance to explore five different rooms, each filled with different attractions.  The Grand Ballroom of Park Plaza will feature psychedelic light shows and dancing, but the Gold Room dons a calmer 1930s jazz feel. In the haunted bridal suite, local storytellers gather to discuss haunts and legends.
Onstage, bands such as The Duke Spirit and Gram Rabbit will contribute various genres of music to the scene. In addition to famed DJ Cut Chemist are 14 KCRW DJs, including Valida the Vicious Vixen and Jeremy Dr. Funkenstein Sole, will provide an eerie spin on the event.
Adorned with decorations and lights, the Park Plaza itself is an ideal choice for such an extravagant gathering.
“It feels haunted — it feels like a great spot for a Halloween party,” Bentley said.
Although the party is titled a “masquerade,” attendees are not required to wear elaborate masks — just costumes. Last year’s ball featured many strangely dressed partygoers, including the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland, the Octomom, jellyfish and even Santa Claus.
Riding on the success of last year, the organizers behind 2010’s Masquerade hope to draw an even bigger crowd.
“We’re always improving,” Bentley said. “We have a really good staff that does our benefit events. It’s really imaginative, their whole approach to it.”
This year’s Masquerade will attempt to make the ball even more flashy and entertaining. Visitors can expect to interact with Lucent Dossier, a vaudeville circus troupe, throughout the halls of the Plaza. People can also use photo booths to take memorable photographs of the evening’s events — a very convenient addition for those rushing in and out of crowded rooms.
And nobody needs to worry about the supply of food — KCRW has secured five food trucks for the outdoor plaza to feed thousands of partygoers. Border Grill, The Slice Truck, Coolhaus, The Sweets Truck and Patty Wagon will ensure that partygoers can enjoy food throughout the evening and into the night, as they dance their way back into hunger and ready their sweet teeth.
Unlike the inaugural masquerade of last year, KCRW isn’t unsure of what will happen. Going on last year’s turnout, the event’s organizers are prepared to make the party a spectacle worth attending.
“I’m hoping that people will look forward to participating,” Bentley said. “It’s more about the overall experience for people. It’s only as good as you want to make it. It’s infectious.”

Not all scary films wait in the horror aisle. Some have snuck into comedy, fantasy and even the kids section, just waiting for your unsuspecting curiosity to rent (or queue, for the Netflix crowd). If you’re bored by eviscerated teenagers, disgusted by Hostel-esque torture porn and have seen every Asian horror film to be legally subtitled, consider these flicks to add a shot of creepy to your Halloween festivities.
Heathers (1989)
Do you like your teen comedy with a side of sadism? Snarky and sardonic, Heathers is the ultimate counterpoint to Easy A and the vicious older sister to Mean Girls. Winona Ryder plays a smart but directionless high schooler both drawn to and disgusted by the popular clique at school — three girls named Heather.
When Christian Slater’s J.D., a psychotic version of Grease’s Danny Zuko, rolls into town, she finds herself in the unlikely position of judge and executioner. Over the top, yes, but all too disturbing when you wonder just how much some people hated the popular club back in high school.
The Dark Crystal (1982)
The 80s were a hotbed of fantasy films meant to traumatize children, but The Dark Crystal comes out on top. Although other films such as Labyrinth and The Neverending Story also featured animatronics, The Dark Crystal has no human actors whatsoever.
Instead, we are treated to a bunch of creepy elves, called Gelflings, who embark on a dangerous quest filled with destruction and danger. The uncanny valley effect is through the roof and children are lucky Jim Henson took a gentler approach to Sesame Street.
Watership Down (1978)
Laugh all you want — how can a movie about bunnies in the English countryside possible be scary? It is, when you realize these rabbits have to fend off dogs, escape toxic fumes and go to war with other ear-shredding Nazi-esque rabbits.
In Watership Down, the characters are not cuddly anthropomorphic Lion King creatures, but real animals who have to fight for survival — and often fail. The brutal and at times surreal art style never shies from blood and gore, and the plot makes it clear the original novel was never a children’s book.
The Night of the Hunter (1955)
Want to know where David Lynch, Martin Scorsese and the Coen brothers picked up some of their inspiration for creep-factor?
Meet The Night of the Hunter, starring Robert Mitchum and Shelley Winters. A murderous preacher is after the money of his hanged cellmate and only the dead man’s son knows where it is. To find the money, the preacher marries his cellmate’s widow. The ensuing drama is wrought with tense chases and narrow escapes.
What sets this film apart, however, is the otherworldly, off-kilter quality of the screenplay. Combined with foreboding lighting and a terrifying performance by Mitchum, The Night of the Hunter is an atmospheric chase through the woods.
The Company of Wolves (1984)
If you consider the original version of Little Red Riding Hood — a tale of cannibalism, strip-teases and a wolf who sounds suspiciously like he wants more than dinner — it makes sense to give the story a creepy spin.
The Company of Wolves ups the ante by making it into a werewolf flick. But forget senseless gore or Taylor Lautner jailbait. This film is a mood piece, a disturbing walk along a trail where wolves can be men who are just hairy on the inside.
It’s a Freudian work, with Angela Lansbury as a creepy but wise grandmother sharing stories with her granddaughter about why girls should stay on the proper path. It’s also an interesting look into gender roles and feminine empowerment, all cloaked in a werewolf skin.
The Land Before Time, (1988)
Don’t laugh — most of you who remember The Land Before Time only saw the dopey sequels, none of which were directed by the original’s Don Bluth. But check out the first film and instead of goofy little dinosaurs, you’ll find a story about five grieving orphans trying to stave off starvation and survive in a ruined world.
The scene when the mother of Littlefoot, the film’s main character, encounters a hungry T-Rex makes Bambi seem placid. The battles and chases in the film are far more intense than typical children’s fair. To top it off, executive producer Stephen Spielberg even had certain scenes deleted after psychologists deemed that parts would cause legitimate trauma.
The original will still make your inner child wince, but keep an eye out for a mythical unedited version that appeared on Finnish television.

Kevin Jones, a senior and budding venture capitalist, is the kind of boss everyone dreams of having.
He is confident, cool and not in it for the money. He believes in the power of the media, but not in the misuse thereof, and is the facilitator of community-driven work. Jones is the founder of the independent collectivist magazine Viceroy. He is not simply an entrepreneur, he is a visionary.
From an early point in his life, Jones was schooled on various aspects of business management. He watched his parents build a company from the ground up and experienced firsthand the trials and tribulations of growing a private business.
But the education that he gleaned from the family business did not come from standing on the sidelines. Jones’ parents urged him to become an active participant and that mindset has certainly followed him into adulthood.
“When I was 7 years old, I began working by folding boxes in my parents’ warehouse facilities for a nickel per box,” Jones said. “My parents are the most intelligent and diligent people I know. I learned a lot from them.”
Building on the foundation set by a family of exceptional entrepreneurs, Jones ultimately began to take on projects of his own. In 2008, he and two of his best friends started an event-planning company out of San Diego, which would work in the college and high school concert scene. The company hosted large-scale parties and shows for students and was the reality check that Jones was looking for.
“We had a few very successful events, but just as many failures,” he said. “It made me question if I really wanted to start my own company.”
Today Jones is in pursuit of an even more ambitious dream: to start and maintain a professional online magazine that will define a generation.
The magazine, titled Viceroy, is based on the idea of collective visions.
“Our goal is to feature USC students who are excelling in their respective spheres of influence, while administering a call for others to venture out and do the same,” Jones said.
Jones, alongside other USC students including Jessica Cymerman (Arts), senior Jason Heim (Sports), and sophomore Bryce Komae (Music), is currently developing and compiling contributions for monthly issues of the magazine, which is burgeoning at a rapid pace.
Nevertheless, the concept of Viceroy, although a business maneuver for Jones and his team, remains grounded in the idea of community. In other words, the mission statement of the magazine is not riddled with financial projections or edgy business strategies but is instead hoping to make money a byproduct of a shared creative process.
“Frankly, to say we are merely ‘social beings’ does not give enough credit to why we need community,” Jones said. “Try living a fulfilling life without other people; it can’t be done.
The purpose of Viceroy is to fill a void that money cannot mend, to inspire its writers and readers alike, and render money secondary to the over-arching aim of “dream realization.” Jones believes the best way to facilitate the dreams of a generation is through togetherness, and his selfless quest to design a publication that encourages pure collaboration and self-expression is the epitome of an artistic community.
“We are all members of different communities and I find it most fulfilling when we forge bonds that allow us to share affinities and empathize with one another,” Jones said. “Though I would still consider myself very self-centered, my desires started to change as I began to learn what it means to truly, unselfishly love other people, which almost always entails sacrificing my own agenda.”
What we find most often in the musings of successful individuals is that behind the rumors of reported egotism and superficiality, is a conflicted and surprisingly humble human being. This is not to say that Jones will ever be subjected to such misinterpretation, but, on the whole, entrepreneurs are stigmatized by the doings of a few bad apples.
We find in this case a confidently cool mover and shaker, with a sometimes self-critical view of himself.
“I wouldn’t say I have really strayed from this path,” Jones said. “But I do constantly doubt whether I am good enough to do this.”
Nonetheless, Jones, although doubtful in moments, is reassured and strengthened by the community that he has created.
If nothing else, Jones’ undying passion shows us that he is good enough — that we are all good enough.

Artisanal LA was not just a demonstration of local and sustainable food businesses in Los Angeles. What unfolded was nothing short of a massive tea party — a celebration featuring unique story tales told over drinks, sweet munchies and crafts.
Sampler platter · Artisanal LA allowed vendors the opportunity to share their products with attendees and gain some free promotion through word of mouth — and gave the visitors a chance to indulge in some of Los Angeles’ tastiest homemade baked goods and other food products. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan 
More than 75 local artisan vendors convened at the top floor of the Cooper Design Space in Downtown Los Angeles on  Oct. 23 and 24. drawing  continuous streams of curious and hungry Angelenos.
“Local” and “sustainable” are buzzwords tossed around in the world of food movements, but LA Street Food Festival co-founder and USC alumna Shawna Dawson launched the two-day event to bring these concepts closer to home.
Only a handful of the vendors at Artisanal LA were nationally known; the rest were smaller private businesses, catering mainly to local communities. The majority of them operate online, relying on word of mouth to promote their services and products.
The event benefited all parties: Vendors got some publicity, while attendees could freely browse, sample and shop from stall after stall of home-baked, hand-sewn and homebrewed edibles and collectibles. To top it all off, part of the $15 entry ticket went toward local charitable organizations.
Throughout the day, attendees could also participate in workshops and view demonstrations by various chefs and food connoisseurs.
The event was an intimate gathering that brought the Los Angeles community together to mingle, eat and celebrate a common passion and enthusiasm that marks each skill and experience — be it sewing cupcake-lined aprons, spicing up popcorn with Bhut Jolokia Ghost pepper or canning turkey-bacon jam.
Each vendor at Artisanal LA had an intimate history with cooking and a reason for getting into their craft.
The Welsh Baker’s Denise Carbone was born in the United Kingdom, and has fond memories of watching her mother cook round, flat cakes from an old family recipe. After moving to America in her 20s, she continued the tradition with her own family, but didn’t initially find the incentive to turn it into a business.
When Denise’s husband Joe lost his job in the recession, they decided to sell these traditional cakes together, coming up with a way to griddle the cakes in large batches and creating fun variations such as chocolate chip and pumpkin.
Yet another notable family enterprise is the Villebois Kitchen, a team consisting of a mother and two daughters, who served up traditional family recipes from Villebois, France, such as rich pork rillete pate, home-whipped specialty Port and Fig butter and several different savory tarts.
My Delight Cupcakery is another mother-daughter team founded by Melinda and Naomi Moreno, but they were represented by two employees who enthusiastically heaped praises on their employers for their wildly innovative creations, such as their breakfast cake, which is a buttermilk cupcake loaded with bacon bits, topped with a butter-maple frosting, and sprinkled with more bacon crumbles.
One employee said his birthday present from his boss Naomi was cupcakes inspired by his favorite liquor — a Jack Daniels cupcake, complete with whiskey-spiked frosting.
Meanwhile, Collisionware’s shy owner Angie Diersman works solo — a photo editor by day, brilliant kitchenware crafter by night.
She recalled forcing her family to “buy” the random scraps she sewed together as a child. But now, people are actually buying her artworks willingly. At the present she is operating part-time primarily through Etsy.com, but she says she hopes to be a full-time crafter one day.
Each stall seemed to present another story. Ococoa’s owner and chocolatier Diana Malouf, who’d always had a fascination with baking, fell in love with confectionery during college and then leapt into a daring enterprise despite not having had formal training. She mixes her Middle-Eastern heritage with her sweet confections, churning out distinctive flavors such as pistachio date and sesame fig.
Sweet Détente’s owner Robin Schwartz loves to travel — but for now, she jetsets vicariously through gastronomy by bringing sweet regional favorites from different countries in individually sized dessert bites including English bakewell tartlettes, mini French macarons and Lebanese ma’amoul.
It took five years of research, she said, and Schwartz plans to live and breathe sweet goods for as long as she can.
Meanwhile, Patricia Tsi, owner of Chocovino, did some traveling of her own. She kissed the corporate world goodbye and flew to Mexico to learn the most basic and ancient chocolate-making techniques used by the Mayans and Aztecs 2,000 years ago.
There is no tempering, couching or refining and no addition of artificial flavors or soy lecithin — just pure stone-ground cacao beans over lava stone to produce gritty, earthy dark chocolate. Truly as artisan as chocolate can get.
Artisanal LA is the first event to celebrate a modern local and sustainable movement, but it was still in every way old and timeless: making pure artisanal craft. Keeping traditions and cultures. Sharing good food and good stories.
In fact, the words “local” and “sustainable” were no longer just lofty, preachy terms that day. They came with a definite picture: the stories and faces of each individual vendor and shopper.
If you’re ever in Vancouver, there’s a Baker’s Market with all local community bakers there.

If you’ve watched more than an hour of television since the beginning of October, it’s likely you’ve seen an advertisement either praising or bashing one of California’s two gubernatorial candidates: Republican Meg Whitman and Democrat Jerry Brown.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
This election — like many of the current local, state and national elections — features two particularly antithetical candidates.
The one thing every candidate in every election has in common, however, is that none would be running for his desired position if it weren’t for campaign contributions.
The power of money in politics is not a modern phenomenon, and campaign finance reform has been an endeavor as old as politics itself, the most recent example of which is the McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002.
Nevertheless, legal loopholes have effectively mitigated even the most powerful campaign finance reform laws.
For example, there is a cap on the amount individuals can give directly to a candidate’s campaign, but labor unions, corporations and individuals have circumvented this law with “soft-money” contributions, which are paid to national parties and then used to finance state elections, with no limit.
Money will likely influence politics forever, but today’s campaign finance system has serious flaws.
Total contributions to all candidates in the 2008 presidential election reached more than $1.7 billion, triple the total amount raised in the 2000 presidential election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
And the total spent by presidential candidates during the 2008 presidential campaign reached more than $1.3 billion, almost four times the total amount spent during the 2000 presidential campaign.
If you didn’t count, that’s nine zeros. We’re talking about upwards of a billion dollars just in one year’s presidential election.
Money can’t buy votes, but it can buy voter influence. With effective political advertising, candidates and the parties, unions and corporations financially supporting them can impact and mobilize voters.
In effect, politicians with deep pockets or influential fundraisers have a significantly greater chance of being the candidate representing the Democratic or Republican Party in an election and winning that election.
The most important player in campaign finance isn’t the powerful lobbyist, mighty labor union, prosperous corporation or wealthy individual. Rather, it is the fundraiser or solicitor who has a large Rolodex with endless names of people willing to donate the maximum directly to a particular candidate.
These individuals are the unsung heroes who politicians flock to and serenade come campaign time.
Aside from the inherently uneasy feeling people have toward this more unsavory side of politics, there are many reasons why we should care about campaign contributions.
Fewer people are voting, while more and more money is being raised and spent during campaigns.
As a result, the small group of political donors and fundraisers is gaining power, while average Americans sit on the sidelines unaware of the rules and results of these political contests.
Moreover, candidates need outside money to run for office; Meg Whitman has raised $18,000,000 outside of what she’s pulled from her own wallet.
As a result, candidates themselves must spend a tremendous amount of time begging the rich or well connected, instead of promoting themselves to the ordinary voter.
Unfortunately, campaign finance reformers, while valiant in their efforts, have fallen short of success.
Lawmakers and citizens alike must ask themselves if the current system is fixable or beyond repair. But either way, something needs to be done.
Two advocates for recreating a new campaign finance system are Yale professors Bruce Ackerman and Ian Ayres.
Their 2002 book Voting With Dollars: A New Paradigm for Campaign Finance Reform describes and promotes a system with two distinctly new components: a mechanism to blind candidates from the names of their private contributors and a program that gives every voter a monetary credit of equal value to be deposited at secret donation booths.
Shielding candidates from their contributors eliminates the potential for quid pro quo dealings if a candidate is elected but still allows individuals to financially support candidates they believe are best fit to run a local, state or national office.
The monetary credit — or what Ackerman and Ayres call “Patriot dollars” — levels the playing field allowing all citizens to get involved, and the secrecy of the ballot box impedes special-interest dealings.
We need to find an answer to the problem of what is essentially legalized corruption in political campaigns throughout the United States.
The Ackerman and Ayres reform proposal offers a pragmatic solution that promises a significant reduction of private, self-interested contributions while opening campaign finance to all.
Removing money entirely from politics seems unrealistic, but institutionalizing a democratic form of campaign finance is a matter of will.

If the British Petroleum oil spill taught the world anything besides how to wildly mishandle an environmental catastrophe, it was the importance of a well-worded apology.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
The months following the Deepwater Horizon explosion were fraught with all manner of official apologies that would make any public relations major cringe, a YouTube-worthy gag reel of precisely what not to say.
There was BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg’s infamous NBC interview in which he referred to the workers along the Gulf Coast impacted by the accident as “the small people” while trying to apologize for the catastrophe. He later backpedaled and said he had spoken “clumsily,” but, as with the initial explosion, the damage had already been done.
That same week there was Rep. Joe L. Barton’s gem of an apology for an apology, which had the entire Republican Party wishing ruefully for a rewind button: Barton, who apologized to BP for the audacity of the Obama administration in asking it to pay reparations, was then bullied by leaders of his own party into retracting his statement.
The comedy of apologetic errors was rounded out by BP CEO Tony Hayward, who, apparently oblivious that the families of the 11 dead Deepwater Horizon workers were probably watching his statement, summed up his apology in an interview with Think Progress by saying that he would like his life back. True to form, Hayward later apologized for his apology.
As oil and tactless redresses continued to flow unchecked, it seemed that we didn’t have a lot to learn from the businessmen across the pond. But now, six months after the catastrophe, something constructive has come from British oil strategy after all.
Industry and administration officials have announced that the United States is looking into grafting the British system of drilling regulation and safety procedures onto its own, though nothing concrete has been decided yet, according to the Los Angeles Times. Such a system would shift the onus of safety responsibility onto oil and gas companies and away from the former scapegoats, which often seemed to be whoever lost the muddled game of red-tape hot potato.
Instead of trying to cover all its bases with wildly unrelated regulations, the British system of accountability asks the oil and gas companies involved to predict worst-case scenarios and then demonstrate the best ways of preventing and dealing with them. Surprisingly, it was those companies — the ones that stand the most to lose should another accident occur — that suggested a similar system be implemented in the United States.
Accountability, it seems, is not dead after all.
The British devised their system after the 1988 Piper Alpha explosion, a natural gas disaster that killed 167 workers. They were smart enough to realize they needed to make changes in their safety regulations, and by the early 1990s they had implemented a new system, which has since been taken up by drilling companies across the globe.
It’s time for us to do the same.
Statistically, the British model is far more successful than the one we’re currently working in — it also probably helps that it employs a ratio of inspectors to oil and gas installations more than 18 times greater than ours.
Though there’s been some concern that the use of new wells will be delayed by the system overhaul, this move is undoubtedly a progressive one. Taking a reactionary approach to crisis management only enters all involved parties into a global edition of the blame game, which means that on top of the catastrophic economic and environmental impact, we’ll all have to sit through another round of apologies.
Far from the madding crowd, BP is now enjoying a slightly lower profile as it recovers from its own exhaustive apology — a press conference in which Hayward said he was “deeply sorry” for the accident and pinky-swore not to run out on his company’s $20-billion tab.
It was a British company that was responsible for the gulf oil spill disaster, but it is also the British system of safety regulations that could provide the key to preventing the next one.
Gun-shy as we might be about trusting them with the future of off-shore drilling, hopefully everyone can recognize that the British model is a wise one, and we can move forward adapting it to our drilling industry.
Ignoring it because we’re too focused on quotas from new wells or too proud to admit to the flaws of our own system only increases the risk of another accident, as we add new regulations and compound the confusion about the existing ones.
A collaborative effort between British and American drilling experts to prevent such accidents would be, finally, nothing to apologize for.

About 1,000 people participated in the Out of the Darkness walk, held this past Saturday, to benefit the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Starting at Santa Monica City Hall, the walk seeks to raise awareness for what is often considered an extremely taboo subject.
The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention began the walks in 2004, which now take place annually in the fall in more than 220 cities across the United States. It is free to participate, but the foundation asks for any possible donations. The foundation is hoping to raise $5 million for both local and national programs that specialize in not only suicide prevention and education, but also survivor loss.
Booths were also set up around the event in order to provide pamphlets on mental health, support groups and suicide hotlines.
Many feel the event is an opportunity to both celebrate the life’s of those who have committed suicide, and find support in others who have shared similar experiences.
“Only those who have lost someone by suicide understand how painful it is,” Marci Seals told the Los Angeles Times. Seals’ 19-year-old daughter committed suicide two years ago.
“You’re here with people who are experiencing the same type of loss you are. To see people going on with their lives gives me hope,” she said.
Thank you for writing about this.

Matt Barkley might not be able to bring home a bowl trophy, but he might earn some hardware of a different kind this season.
The sophomore quarterback was named one of 16 semifinalists for the 2010 Davey O’Brien National Quarterback Award today.
Based on the criteria of “quarterback skills, academics, character, leadership and sportsmanship,” The O’Brien National Selection Committee looks at quarterbacks from schools across the country before selecting each semifinalist, factoring in a fan vote.
Barkley — along with Boise State’s Kellen Moore and Iowa’s Ricky Stanzi —is a returning semifinalist.
Named for former TCU standout Davey O’Brien — who still holds NCAA records for most rushing and passing plays in a single-season that were set in 1938 — the award is given annually to the best quarterback in collegiate football.
The 20-year-old USC quarterback has had a standout sophomore season, and is ranked seventh among the nation’s quarterbacks. He’s tied for fourth in number of touchdowns thrown on the season at 20, and has received much praise for the offensively driven 48-14 victory he led against Cal in USC’s most recent game.
Fans now determine which three quarterbacks will be named finalists by voting at www.VoteOBrien.org. Fans can vote as often as they’d like, but only once daily, until 10 a.m. on Nov. 21.

Location-based service Foursquare hit 4 million users at the end of last week, and though it’s unlikely to eclipse names like Facebook, Google or even Twitter in the Internet landscape, it’s approaching fast.
One has to wonder, though — what exactly is the point?
For those unfamiliar to the service, imagine an application where you and your chosen “friends” vie for badges and the title of mayor of restaurants, bars, gyms — anywhere you might possibly hang out — through winning points by “checking in” every time you visit.
There’s not much at stake here, besides bragging rights, the rare coupon or business incentive and a litany of “tips,” which can include tidbits like “Never eat the fish here” and “If you tell the fat bouncer his hair looks nice, he’ll let you in first.”
Foursquare even connects to your Twitter or Facebook so every stalker can know where you are all the time.
Any Trojan Tweeter will notice that students will even check into classrooms and spots on campus, even though the university does not offer any incentives to do so. Here are some fanciful suggestions for what the administration should do to its dedicated social media addicts.
Ronald Tutor Campus Center Food Court
Hands down, the mayor should definitely get “cutsies” on any line during prime lunch hour. As in, front-of-line, no questions asked, move-over-freshmen privileges. Getting CPK Express in an actual “express” amount of time? Perfectly privileged — and logical.
Make it happen, Kris Klinger!
Annenberg School of Communication
Students here hear social media buzzwords almost daily in their classes. Shouldn’t there be some reward here for those most loyal to the burgeoning social media saturation? The mayor here should get to print for free. Or an internship.
Leavey Library
Any attention-hungry blowhard that checks into Leavey is just crying for study sympathy. Boo-hoo, you’re in college — you have to you know, learn a little. That lucky stiff that wins the title of mayor, however, should be able to set up a comfortable nook, complete with scented candles, beanbag chairs, nutritious (but quiet) snacks and an espresso machine. And perhaps a GPA boost.
Lyon Center
Let’s be real — the mayor of this lovely athletic facility deserves only one thing, the most coveted and most rare of sites: a reserved-just-for-them fully functioning piece of exercise equipment.
New/North, Marks Hall, Troy Apartments and any building in USC Housing
Anyone competing to be the mayor of the dorm they live in deserves a single award: a smack in the face. Alerting the Internet you’re home is just crying for them to come into your house and assault your person. Seriously.

Meg Whitman has broken the record of having the most expensive non-presidential campaign in the history of politics, according to the National Post. Despite this, recent polls show the woman who hopes to be California’s first female governor is trailing her opponent by double-digits.
The Republican gubernatorial candidate, who is also the former CEO of eBay, has spent at least $140 million of her personal funds during the race against current state Attorney General Jerry Brown over the governorship.
However, despite the huge difference in monetary spending (Brown has invested only $11 million in his campaign), Whitman is almost 13 points behind the former governor, according to a recent Los Angeles Times/USC poll. Brown’s lead has more than doubled since a LAT/USC poll was conducted in September.
Whitman invested heavily in the Latino community, hoping to get its support, but political experts have said the recent revelation that Whitman employed an illegal immigrant and and firing her after learning of her status might have damaged a lot of the work Whitman was trying to do in the Latino community.

Sophomore Kelly Owen led a young USC women’s cross country squad to a sixth-place finish at Friday’s Titan Invitational at Cal State Fullerton.
Running without many of its top competitors, USC instead sent mostly freshmen and sophomores to the 5K race in Fullerton, Calif. in order to help them gain some race experience late in the season.
Owen set a 5K personal best with a time of 18:27.7, good enough for 19th place overall and 12th among scoring runners. The personal record was the second straight for Owen, who also ran a career best 6K last week at Cal State Northridge. Owen’s performance all but solidified her spot on the squad that USC will send to the Pac-10 Championships next week.
The rest of the Women of Troy’s scoring team from Friday consisted of mostly unfamiliar names. Redshirt sophomore Anniya Louis finished second for USC at 22nd overall. Louis, who has struggled with injuries since arriving in 2008, set a 5K personal best time in what was her first official race at USC.
Freshman Jaclyn Walles continued the trend of personal records with a time of 18:31, finishing right behind Louis at 23rd overall.
Allison Rojewski, the lone senior on Friday’s squad, finished 51st overall, followed by USC’s final official runner, freshman Francesca Adamski, who placed 65th.
Next up for the Women of Troy are the Pac-10 Championships in Seattle on Oct. 30. Expected to compete for USC are seniors Zsofia Erdelyi, Christine Cortez, Dina Kitayama and Zara Luken, junior Leah Gaeta, redshirt sophomore Jessica Lundin, and Owen.
