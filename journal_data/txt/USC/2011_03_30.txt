The USC women’s water polo team dominated from start to finish, cruising to a 19-4 victory Wednesday evening 19-4 against No. 16 Hartwick. With the win, the team increased its home winning streak to 23 games.
No. 3 USC (15-3, 3-1) scored five goals in the first quarter, with five different girls scoring. The offensive outburst set the tone for the rest of the match, and by halftime, USC led 8-2.
The second half was not much different, as USC scored five more goals in the third period. Again, five different players found the back of the net, giving the Women of Troy a comfortable lead 14-3 lead.
The Hawks would score one more goal the rest of the way, while USC added six more goals in the fourth.
Offensively, senior driver Joelle Bekhazi led USC with a hat trick. More impressively, however, was the fact that 12 Women of Troy scored in the match, six of which had two goals apiece.
USC’s next match is Saturday against No. 1 Stanford. Game is scheduled for 12 p.m. at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.

Trojan Grounds has reversed its decision to decrease its hours of operation, following heavy student protest. The convenience store and coffee shop will return to its 24-hour schedule Monday.
Convenience · Trojan Grounds will again be open 24 hours a day until finals this semester, and Hospitality will ask for feedback this summer. - Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan
TroGro announced last week it would begin closing from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., a decision that drew much anger and disappointment from the student body.
Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, said the decision to restore the original hours came after he received hundreds of emails from students, who brought up safety concerns and other issues.
“Some of the emails we received were powerful and moving, and made good arguments,” Klinger said. “Some of the safety concerns that the students mentioned were extremely valid. If they wanted a snack between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., they would have to go off campus, and it’s not as safe as it is on campus.”
Klinger explained the previous decision to close TroGro between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. was due in part to a low level of student traffic during those hours as well as a fiscal responsibility to allocate the university resources to areas of need.
After seeing the reaction from students, however, USC Hospitality realized the best decision for the university would be to have TroGro open 24/7 this semester and reallocate the resources to make it possible.
“USC students are very intelligent and well spoken, and they know how to get a message across without making us feel pressured,” Klinger said. “This decision has a lot to do with the students. We want to hear what students have to say and we’ll continue to keep doing that.”
USC Hospitality will determine this summer if the decision to return TroGro to a 24-hour convenience store and coffee shop is permanent.
“TroGro will remain open 24 hours for the rest of the year, and we will then meet and talk with student leaders and administration,” Klinger said. “The goal is to have some sort of offering that is 24/7 on campus.”
Klinger said there was a common misconception among emails he received from students, however.
“Some of the students said that [the university is] a profit-making entity, and we’re not,” Klinger said. “Any of the dollars spent by USC Hospitality stay at the university, either for the employees or to fund future growth for any different changes we may make.”
Christine Coner, a freshman majoring in business administration-cinematic arts, said although she is excited about the change, she wishes students could have received personal responses from the administration.
“I know people who emailed USC Hospitality and other members of the administration who were a little frustrated that they weren’t getting an individual response,” Coner said. “I know that’s kind of hard for them to do, but it still would have been nice. But we’re all still glad that they listened to what we had to say.”
Tim Sae Koo, USG’s director of University Affairs, met with Klinger and Phillip Valdez, associate director of operations at the Campus Center, after learning how students felt.
“My response was to go talk with Kris and Phil and ask for any information to see what we could do to streamline the communication between students and administration,” Sae Koo said. “We wanted to listen to the students because we are basically their representatives, and we leverage their voices to the administration.”
Sae Koo said to make TroGro’s hours of operation permanent for years to come, students should continue to actively demonstrate their support.
“The only thing we can really do if this decision is not made permanent is to gather student input,” he said. “The focus of the administration is that they are here for students.”
Across campus, students are expressing happiness with how the administration responded to their emails.
“It’s great that they took our emails into consideration, even though they had already made the decision and formed their own opinion on the matter,” said Sharon Kim, a sophomore majoring in occupational therapy.
Employees are also reacting positively to the news as many had previously shown concern over how the time changes would affect the number of hours they could work.
“[Employees] are being made aware of it, and I know they are all very excited,” Klinger said. “Their hours were reduced, so this will be a positive move in a number of ways. Employees get more hours, and students get TroGro open 24/7.”
Kate Armstrong, a freshman majoring in political science, said she is anxiously waiting for TroGro to be open again in the early morning hours.
“I’ll definitely be coming back there at 2 a.m. on Tuesday morning,” she said.

Predraft workouts can make or break a player’s draft status, and a player’s stock can rise or fall in the months leading up to the big day.
For those looking to eliminate any questions and cement their status as legitimate pro talent, a good showing can really create some buzz among the media and scouts, increasing their draft stock.
For those already ensured a high draft pick based on game film, sitting out of certain workouts might be the safest option, so as not to create any doubt in the minds of scouts, should they underperform.
During predraft workouts, the field takes the place of the classroom, and the athletes are given grades based on performance. In short, players train and practice for hours as students of the game, performing in drills to show they are ready for the next level.
At USC’s Pro Day, numerous Trojans looked to solidify their draft status and show scouts they were ready to play with the big boys.
I was amazed to see up close the sheer strength and athleticism some of these athletes possess.
Despite projections as an early first-round pick, Tyron Smith, who has added 30 pounds since the season ended, went through all the drills. He ran a 4.92 40-yard dash and benchpressed 225 pounds 31 times.
Wide receiver David Ausberry posted the best 40-time at 4.46 seconds, and offensive guard Zack Heberer benchpressed 225 pounds 38 times.
It’s amazing to see someone run a sub-4.5 second 40-yard dash, pump out 38 bench-press repetitions like nothing or completely blow away the rest of the competition as if it’s no more than a video game.
But what does all this really mean?
Sure, the eye-dropping numbers are definitely something to talk about, but numbers alone certainly doesn’t tell the whole story.
Wide receiver Ronald Johnson posted a 40 time of 4.49 seconds, although he wasn’t entirely impressed with his own performance in that particular drill.
Johnson isn’t overly concerned, though.
“I don’t think [it] really matters as much,” he said. “When you’re on the field, if you’re fast and look fast on the field … I don’t think it really matters. I didn’t feel good about it, but it is what it is, and I can’t do it over.”
Yes and no.
The numbers aren’t entirely relevant, but it does matter in the sense that speed, or even strength, will be the only measuring stick for performance.
Oakland Raiders wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey ran a 4.3-second 40-yard dash time and was selected seventh overall in the 2009 NFL draft.
So far, his career hasn’t gone exactly how owner Al Davis must have envisioned.
Like the 40-yard dash and the benchpress are both used as a measuring stick, the Wonderlic test is used to gauge prospective NFL players and their success in the league.
Former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino scored a 16 on the test (the average at this position is 24), but he will be remembered as one of the greatest to play the position.
Sure, there are examples of athletes who match their performance on the test with that on the field such as Vince Young.
Young certainly looked good against USC, running over smaller linebackers and defensive backs, but look at how his NFL career has turned out.
Yet for every Marino, there are 10 Youngs.
Some numbers scored in a couple of drills cannot determine how successful an athlete will be at the next level.
Remember: We might be enamored with the jaw-dropping athleticism, speed and strength of collegiate athletes, but the professional ranks are a whole new ballgame.

What Wednesday’s NFL Pro Day lacked in depth and quantity, it surely made up in the star quality of offensive tackle Tyron Smith.
Despite an uncharacteristically lackluster showing from the USC overall, the 6-foot-5, now-310-pound Smith might have moved himself into the discussion to be a top-10 pick in next month’s NFL draft.
Doing work · Despite a disappointing 40-yard dash time, wide receiver Ronald Johnson had a solid showing in the individual drills. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
In an effort to improve his first-round stock, Smith added 30 pounds of bulk to his playing weight of 285 pounds, while still retaining his above-average athleticism. Though he only ran a decent 4.92-second 40-yard dash, Smith hit 31 reps on the bench press and displayed quick feet and fluid movement in individual drills.
“I wanted to run faster [and get to a] 4.8 and I was mad when I found out I was at a 4.9,” Smith said with a laugh. “I feel like overall I did good today.”
With Dallas Cowboys coach Jason Garrett in attendance (validating rumors about Dallas’ interest in Smith at No. 9), it looks as if Smith’s draft stock is truly on the rise as the Detroit Lions (No. 13) also came out in full force to watch the heralded junior prospect.
“From here on out, I just want to improve upon my speed and strength and work on my technique,” Smith said.
Among the other lineman, senior offensive tackle Butch Lewis showed up at a lean 311 pounds, and, although overshadowed by Smith, was nonetheless impressive in workouts.
Tight end Jordan Cameron wowed scouts during position drills, showing off strong hands and field speed that correlates well with his combine numbers (a 4.59-second 40-yard dash).
As Cincinnati Bengals tight end coach Jordan Hayes gave advice to Cameron throughout the day, the 6-foot-5 senior displayed excellent body control and a knack for snagging balls away from his body.
Although the BYU transfer played sparingly for the Trojans until this past fall, Cameron still projects as a mid-round pick because of his unique athleticism at the tight end position.
“I think I did really well today and just showed off what I can do,” Cameron said. “I need to get better at blocking and get a little more experience under my belt, but I’ll be fine.”
Wide receiver Ronald Johnson posted an underwhelming 4.49-second 40-yard dash time, but helped his stock during individual drills, where he rarely missed a pass and showed great burst coming out of his cuts.
Throwing to Johnson, quarterback Mitch Mustain looked to be in peak physical shape, weighing in at a solid 221 pounds. During the passing drills, the former Arkansas quarterback had some zip on his passes to go along with a fundamentally sound approach behind center.
On the defensive side of the ball, cornerback Shareece Wright came down with a possibly serious knee injury after he caught his foot in the ground during ball drills.
The biggest surprise of the day came from outside linebacker prospect Malcolm Smith. Not invited to the combine, the 225-pound Smith ran a 4.47-second 40-yard dash, reached 28 reps on the bench and looked just as good during individual drills.
With visits with the Chicago Bears and Seattle Seahawks coming up, Smith is hoping to lock up a draft spot, especially with the current NFL lockout and teams’ inability to sign free agents.
 
This was some great insight by the writer! It’s unique to be able to obtain some objective feedback during these sort of events. 
There are some who compare Ronald Johnson favorably to fellow allumus, Steve Smith (NYG); he could be a real steal for someone picking in the 4-6 rounds.

It wasn’t supposed to be this easy.
The USC women’s basketball team rolled into the championship game of the Women’s National Invitation Tournament by recording its fourth straight double-digit win, a 63-36 victory over Illinois State.
Leading the way · Senior guard Jacki Gemelos, pictured here against Oregon, led the Women of Troy with 15 points and seven rebounds in USC’s 63-36 rout of Illinois State. With the win, USC is in the WNIT title game for the first time in the program’s history. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“We’re not surprised,” said senior guard Jacki Gemelos. “It was going to click at some point, and for us it clicked in the tournament.”
After escaping the first round of the WNIT with a three-point win over UC Santa Barbara, the Women of Troy (25-12) have been nearly untouchable. Against the Redbirds, USC corrected the only problem — slow starts — that plagued the team in earlier rounds.
“We were excited to play in front of such a big crowd,” said junior guard Ashley Corral. “We had to come out strong and kind of shut them up in a sense.”
Illinois State (24-12), which went undefeated at home this season, dug an early hole by missing its first 11 shots of the game.
USC, meanwhile, jumped out to a quick start behind hot shooting from Gemelos.
Midway through the first half, the Women of Troy held a 16-1 lead, the crowd was silent and the rout was on. Illinois State only drew within single digits twice after that for a total of 21 seconds, and never seriously challenged USC’s march to the WNIT championship.
“Everything is clicking right now for everybody, as a team and as individuals,” Gemelos said. “Winning is contagious. It gives us a swagger coming into each game.”
Gemelos led the Women of Troy with 11 points in the first half. Corral continued her torrid outside shooting by knocking down 2-of-3 three-point attempts in the half. Entering the game, Corral had connected on 17-of-22 three-pointers in the tournament.
“When Ashley’s hot, she’s hot,” Gemelos said. “You know the ball’s going in as soon as it comes off her hand.”
Illinois State finally got on track offensively midway through the first half, connecting on five straight outside shots to momentarily draw within single digits.
But USC weathered the run and took a 30-22 lead into the break.
“We knew they were going to come at us,” Corral said.  “We had to take the punch and accept it.”
The second half was more of the same, with the Redbirds unable to find any kind of rhythm.
Illinois State missed eight of its first nine shots to open the half, allowing the Women of Troy to extend their lead to 43-24 with 13 minutes remaining.
USC’s defense took care of the rest, never letting Illinois State draw closer than 17 points the rest of the way, and holding the Redbirds to less than 20 percent shooting in the second half.   
The Women of Troy led by as many as 27 points in the commanding performance. For the game, the Redbirds made just 16 of their 60 field goal attempts.  USC connected on 24 of its 52 attempts.
Gemelos led USC with 15 points and seven rebounds. Corral added 14 points off the bench, and junior guard Briana Gilbreath chipped in 11 points and three steals for the Women of Troy.
No Illinois State player scored in double figures.
“We’re on a great roll,” Corral said.  “We’re winning by a lot.”
Next up is a road game against Toledo University for the WNIT championship.
The Rockets cruised into the championship game with a 20-point drubbing of their own, taking down Charlotte 83-60.
“I don’t know much about [the Rockets] yet, but clearly they are doing something right,” Corral said.”
Tipoff is scheduled for 3 p.m. Saturday.
FIGHT ON LADIE TROJANS!!! BEAT THE ROCKETS!!
Wow I am glad Cooper started coaching, anything less than the championship would be failure. Very exciting to see this team gel, but why did it take so long? Were Corral and Gemelos, holding back? Hopefully next season, this teams take care of business, and comes out strong in preseason, stronger in Pac-12 play, and even stronger in post season for the 2011-12 year.
I knew something wasn’t right in the Pac-10 this year. Whatever it was glad its over. Toledo, shouldn’t be a problem. Get the title ladies, and prove the NCAA committee wrong.
[…] great thing is the opening line to a game report for the semi-final game between USC and Illinois State: “Jacki Gemelos scored 15 points to lead […]

There are rumors of a special marketplace coming to Los Angeles.
But let’s back up.
Once upon a time, there was a marketplace in Turin, Italy. It was called Eataly, and it was the groundbreaking project of Oscar Farinetti, a man who believed quality products should be available to everyone. 
This marketplace was noticed 3,970 miles away by three culinary juggernauts: Mario Batali and his partners Joe and Lidia Bastianich.
The trio had enjoyed many successful ventures before, with the Batali-Bastianich Hospitality Group pumping out acclaimed restaurants in New York and Las Vegas, among other locales.
Inspired, the group birthed another Eataly. This time, it descended upon the Flatiron district of New York.
But you see, Eataly wasn’t an ordinary marketplace. This particular marketplace was something else, something truly marvelous to behold.
A veritable temple to Italian cuisine with 10 different eateries, its emphases ranged from fish to pasta to chocolates.
Not only that, but the 50,000 square-foot marketplace also upheld one important motto: “We cook what we sell and we sell what we cook.”
And so it cooked and sold a smorgasbord of fascinating and fresh ingredients: wine and beer, salami and cheese, bread, meat, seafood, fresh and dry pastas, sweets, coffees, olive oils, vinegars, produce, housewares — the list goes on.
Predictably, it was a success. To this day, lines stretch out the door. And now, according to Eater LA, the Los Angeles division of the national food and nightlife blog,  Joe Bastianich, of B&B Hospitality Group, has revealed to an “Eater operative” his plans to open Eataly around the West Hollywood area.
As one Eater LA commenter put it, “mind. exploding.”
If you enjoy eating food, this is very exciting news. After all, there’s not really this kind of serious food destination in Los Angeles, a place where you can legitimately spend an entire day eating and shopping in a mecca of everything Italian and delicious.
If it’s possible to get geeked out on food, this is it.
But frankly, the most exciting part about it isn’t that foodies will have a place to drool over. In fact, Eataly isn’t something that necessarily works on paper in this still-weak economy.
A high-end marketplace, featuring lots of gourmet products and gourmet food in a country where buying wholesale and fast food reign supreme seems unlikely.
Eataly NY pulled it off. And in the process, it did something even more impressive: It gave everyone, not just diehard food lovers, a chance to be awed and inspired by the beauty of quality food and quality ingredients.
Those who care about food have been saying it all along: quality, quality, quality.
Oftentimes this involves buying small, local purveyors or from growers, butchers and fishmongers who have a burning passion for their product and only choose to serve the best to customers. But it can get expensive.
If there’s anything the gourmet coffee generation has taught us, however, it’s that people can get used to, and appreciate, the higher costs of specialty products.
Many students probably don’t think twice about consuming a $3 or $4 macchiatto these days, even if it racks up a hefty tab in the long run.
Why? It’s not only the flavor, but understanding the benefits of free trade coffee and supporting employees who, at least in theory, feel good about choosing something better, not just something cheaper.
It’s not a far path from this to start to enjoy better meats, produce and the like, which is exactly the kind of thing a place like Eataly can encourage.
What Batali and the Bastianichs have brought to the United States is incredible.
It is an all-encompassing experience where you can have a great dish and then realize, ‘Hey, I can buy that prosciutto di parma and those watermelon radishes right here and try making it myself.’
It’s that little spark of wonderment that just might make someone want to seriously eat better more often. And hell, I can’t think of anything more inspiring than 50,000 square feet of straight-up deliciousness.
Eataly LA might only be in the planning stages, but I can’t help but hope it becomes a reality.

Movie of the Week —
Super, Premieres Friday
If Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and Kick-Ass just weren’t enough for you, here is yet another movie based on the average guy in an unfortunate situation who becomes a super hero of sorts. Rainn Wilson and Ellen Page are unlikely and largely untalented sidekicks in the upcoming Super, a movie about a heartbroken man who dresses up in a costume and uses “Shut up, crime!” as his catch phrase.
Whether the movie will live up to the video-game visuals and quirky humor of Pilgrim and Kick-Ass is anyone’s guess, but with help from Nathan Fillion and Footloose star Kevin Bacon, it might put up a bit of a fight.
Event of the Week
–
First Friday at the Natural History Museum,
Friday at 8 p.m.

Who says a tire can’t go on a killing spree and murder people with psychic powers?
Not Quentin Dupieux, whose wild, irreverent film Rubber, a French comedy-horror of the utmost bizarreness, opens tomorrow.
Renee Cohn | Daily Trojan
Rubber begins in a desolate desert, where a man, presumably a tour guide, played by Jack Plotnick, stands at the end of a dirt road.
Soon, a police lieutenant (Stephen Spinella) arrives, and starts the film’s dialogue by addressing the camera.
In this opening address, Lieutenant Chad calls the viewer’s attention to seemingly random elements of popular movies, such as “Why is the alien brown in E.T.?”
He goes on to point out that “life itself is made up of no reason,” and that what the audience is about to see “is an homage to no reason.”
After this strange introduction, we see much of the movie through the point of view of the 10 or so spectators armed with binoculars to view the landscape.
This is when the real action begins. We see Robert, a black tire, come to life in the middle of the desert and explore his environment.
Robert soon displays his violent tendencies, however, crushing a water bottle and then a scorpion under his treads.
After several frustrating seconds, Robert stands back and begins to shake violently, emitting an ominous noise. The sound grows louder and louder and a glass bottle nearby explodes.
That’s right, not only is Robert a mean, violent tire, he’s a mean, violent tire with extreme psychic powers.
But when Robert sees an attractive French woman drive by in a convertible, he rolls off after her and the movie’s main chase begins.
A completely irreverent, occasionally stupid, yet incredibly entertaining film, Rubber plays with our sense of what is real, what is a film and what is really going on in this strange little universe. The dark humor of the movie (picture a tire sitting on an armchair in a hotel room watching NASCAR, with the bodies of several victims splattered across the room) is anything but tasteful, yet still successful.
During one particularly memorable scene, Lieutenant Chad tells all of his fellow police officers, as they investigate one of the tire’s murders, they can all stop pretending and go home to their families since all the spectators are now dead and they no longer need to put on a show.
Rubber’s direct toying with our interpretation of what’s real within the movie can have a polarizing effect: People will either love it,or absolutely hate it, which is exactly the kind of critical reception Rubber has received.
Though entertaining, the film seems to fall flat on its face in a few places.
In one extremely long scene, more than a minute long, we watch a poisoned man slowly writhe and die. Adding nothing to the film, the grotesque scene merely detracts from what was becoming a fun movie.
And although there is a fun mood in playing with the idea of “no reason,” this movie is a problem for anyone who wants to feel like they’re watching something meaningful.
Can we find a reason or meaning in a violent tire-villain rampaging across the desert? Don’t come looking for a Hollywood-style thriller in Rubber, but come with an open mind and an empty stomach and a very original film experience is ensured.

By now, we’ve all seen the infamous Charlie Sheen interview on Good Morning America.
Sheen’s party boy personality is nothing new. In fact, he was fortunate enough to have a character built around it on Two and a Half Men.
This interview, however, transformed the celebrity’s image from that of a quirky star with a few vices to a man who is literally insane.
Some viewers were appalled. Some found it hilarious. Sheen’s egotistic expressions became viral jokes on the Internet and Two and a Half Men got higher ratings than ever before. The show might be on hiatus, but its producers are laughing all the way to the bank.
The reaction to Sheen highlights the public’s increasing demand for outrageous celebrities. People love a train wreck. The problem, however, is we’ve started to not just enable these breakdowns, but also to encourage them.
I was skeptical of Sheen’s persona on Good Morning America. Was Sheen merely acting, or was his behavior actually indicative of his real personality?
Some might recall  Joaquin Phoenix’s appearance on David Letterman’s show a few years ago, during which the actor had a huge beard, stuck his gum under Letterman’s desk and was awkwardly averse to conversation.
It was later revealed the incident was a promotional stunt for an upcoming film of Phoenix’s, and the joke was on the public.
But what’s different about Sheen is he has a track record that backs up his insanity.
A recent GQ article details Sheen’s extravagant liaisons with prostitutes and porn stars, and, most damaging of all, cocaine.
Friends of the star say it’s not uncommon to find out his car was stolen and driven off a cliff.
These behind-the-scenes antics certainly support the hypothesis that Sheen has begun to treat life as a game in which anything goes.
And because of our hunger for constant entertainment, we’ve essentially created the atmosphere for him to do this.
Pavlovian analysis of psychology says intelligent beings, given a favorable response to an action, will be more inclined to repeat the action.
It’s a reward system.
People might try to pretend they haven’t rewarded Sheen for his behavior, but they’re wrong. Ratings of Sheen’s show (15.3 million viewers in his first aired episode after Sheen entered home rehab) are indicative enough of this.
Charlie Sheen went crazy, and suddenly became more famous than he was ever before.
If fans make this a trend, it might not only make celebrities crazier than they already are, but actually force them to either fake it, or put themselves in serious danger.

On Monday, President Barack Obama said the United States has the opportunity in Libya to stop the violence and protect Libyans from their ruthless and despotic leader, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.
Obama is trying to play the middle ground. He is acting aggressively to protect the Libyan people and has changed the course of the conflict.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
At the same time, Obama has stated we will not overextend American resources in Libya.
Despite many uncertainties related to the intervention, the Obama administration is acting both justly and altruistically.
The U.S.-led war in Libya doesn’t benefit us in any tangible way. Libya is not strategically vital to the United States despite its strategic location.
The war in Libya is a war of choice, not one of necessity or defense. Obama has made that clear.
Despite his address Monday, Obama has yet to clearly state the expected length of America’s involvement in Libya.
If Obama wants the students who helped elect him in 2008 to vote for him again in 2012, he will have to make sure American resources aren’t overextended in Libya like they are in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently said the United States could be engaged in Libya for up to a year.
But costs of this war might be the most unnerving aspect of the intervention.
The cost incurred by the Pentagon during the first 10 days of the bombings was $550 million, and the Department of Defense expects the war to cost $40 million each month, Pentagon spokeswoman Cmdr. Kathleen Kesler said in a recent email statement.
The United States cannot afford a long intervention in Libya, nor will the American people will not accept one.
NATO action in Libya also risks overstepping the United Nations resolution that initially empowered it, limiting action in Libya to the protection of citizens.
Still, Obama’s intervention in Libya is just, courageous and grandly American.
Gaddafi is one of the most violent rulers in the world today. And action had to be taken.
The war in Libya is an idealistic war for the standards of democracy and freedom; the Obama administration is doing right by standing by these ideals in Libya.
In his recent address to the nation, Obama preached his Woodrow Wilson-like worldview: “Our own future is safer, our own future is brighter, if more of mankind can live with the bright light of freedom and dignity.”
The Obama administration appears to be holding its promise to scale back America’s commitment to the war effort as well as handing over leadership to NATO.
The war in Libya further demonstrates how the United States can act with other international powers in the protection of human rights.
Collective action is essential in humanitarian interventions. American taxpayers cannot afford to bear the full burden of this crisis.
Of course, the United States cannot intervene in every foreign country where atrocities occur.
If it did, America would never have the time to attend to its domestic affairs.
The war on Libya is far from over, and, like all other conflicts, shrouded in confusion.
Yet, as long as American troops never step foot in Libya and resources are not overspent, the Obama administration should be commended for acting against Gaddafi.
The public might be quick to point out the administration’s  tactical flaws in its handling of Libya over the past few weeks. Quite frankly, such criticism might persist.
Regardless, when an American president truly upholds the ideals of freedom and democracy, he should be given his due credit.
 
William Fay is a senior majoring in international relations. His column, “Facing Our Global Challenges,” runs every other Thursday. 
Send me to Libya!  I will work everything out!
Humanitarian missions are for the Red Cross and the Peace Corps, not the military. The military is the most expensive way to intervene around the world. The first day of the conflict depleted our defensive capabilities more than $100 million worth!
News flash, our deficit for 2/2011 was over sixty billion dollars. We need to borrow money to fight this war and the other two. 
Where will the money for this and the other two wars come from? The millions of unemployed aren’t paying taxes to help the war effort. The oil and gas rigs that left the Gulf of Mexico aren’t paying drilling royalties. The Chinese don’t want to buy any new T-Bills. Now is the time to end expensive foreign wars with intangible financial benefit. Now is the time to stop paying NATO & UN dues. Now is the time to turn foreign aid over to the private sector. Now is the time to bring our troops home.
Yeah, Gaddafi is way worse than Saddam Hussein ever was.
Oh wait, no he wasn’t.
The writer states two obvious truths but can’t see his way clear to take the logical next step. Yes, America can’t get involved in every country where atrocities are taking place. And yes, we have no tangible interest in Libya (hey William – it’s a WAR FOR OIL – remember how those are “bad”?).
The logical next step from these two facts is that Obama doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing. Especially since he seems to be helping Al Qaeda types. 
Yeah, the president’s a freaking genius. Keep drinking the Koolaid.
Excuses for excuses???
This was a humanitarian mission that escalated to Land attack missile strikes, then Obama got sucked into support an NFZ. The mission was supposed to be of limited scale, the. The mission creep pulled Obama into an anti armor campaign that resulted into Libyan Loyal Armored Divisions using populated cities as revetment, mitigating pursuing coalition forces immediately. The the Close Air Support units entered theatre, and Spectres and warthogs are on station and loitering. That means JTACs are on the ground, and that means there are units there supporting forward observation.
Obama provides no leadership, no vision and certainly no objectives to the situation. He has no intel, he doesn’t know who the leadership of the separatists are, who they ally with, or which affiliation to unfriendly and anti American groups the rebels ranks may contain.
They are retreating en masse as I speak. 
Not even the United States, the Arab League, NATO, the United Nations and half of the European Union can stand off the Libyan military from advancing and we have  600 million dollars invested in a campaign with no way to win….because there aren’t any objectives.

Thinking about the future and what lies ahead can often be a rather daunting activity. Hearing the stories of others and how their lives came together can help relieve some of that normal anxiety that we all feel.
Today at the University Religious Center, students will be given the chance to listen to USC faculty and staff talk about their lives, in turn giving invaluable stories and advice that will allow you to think about the path of your own life in a different way.
The talk will be headed by Tammy Anderson, executive director of the Joint Educational Project. Anderson has been with JEP since 1981, has a bachelor’s degree in Gerontology, and a master’s degree in higher adult and professional education.
Attendance is free and will take place in Room 103, the United Ministry Lounge, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m

Woody Allen paints Paris as a romantic and beautiful city, full of love and charm, in the official trailer for Midnight in Paris.
The film follows a young couple to the City of Light and their belief “that a life different from theirs would be much better.” If you have ever wanted to live in Europe, where everything seems to be so much more charming, perhaps this is the film for you.
Thierry Frémaux, director of the Festival de Cannes, has called the film a “wonderful love letter to Paris.”
The trailer hints at familiar themes present in Woody Allen’s films, including characters interested in art, history and romance. The official poster of the film shows Owen Wilson walking the streets of Paris under Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night.
Midnight in Paris stars Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Adrien Brody, Marion Cotillard, Michael Sheen, Kathy Bates and Carla Bruni.The film is Woody Allen’s first to be shot entirely in Paris.
Sony Pictures Classics will release Midnight in Paris on May 20, but the world premiere of the film will be at the opening ceremony of the Festival de Cannes on May 11.

In July, 2010 MxPx announced the retirement of founding member and drummer Yuri Ruley and the ceasing of its extensive touring schedule.

Make no mistake, though, the band has not broken up and already has plans to release a new full-length album by the end of 2011. Simply put, they have essentially become a “studio band” who will continue actively putting out new music while not touring the country as Wisniewski and Ruley both have full-time jobs to support their families and Herrera works as a producer and tours the country with his country band, Tumbledown.
The March 26th show  was a very special opportunity for devoted fans who traveled from places like New York, Texas, Calif. and Idaho to see the performance. MxPx blazed through its entire Life in General record, not leaving much time for words in between the seventeen song setlist. After the final song, the crowd clamored for an encore to which the band obliged by playing the live favorite, “Punk Rawk Show.”
After the set, the band members hung around the merchandise table signing posters and shirts for fans while cameras filmed the entire evening’s events, which will likely be included on an upcoming documentary.
MxPx is a veteran band that has been around for 18 years, and while they are slowing down in it is touring duties, its studio work and electrifying live show indicate that the band remains a force to be reckoned with in the music scene.
Mike Herrera will be doing a solo tour of the East Coast in late April before returning home to write both new MxPx and Tumbledown material.
noooo! why just a studio band? I use to go to all their shows when they were in the LA area :/

The Undergraduate Student Government unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday encouraging USC Transportation to coordinate shuttles to take international students directly from the Los Angeles International Airport to University Park Campus during orientation.
Report · Lisa Zhao, USG residential senator, present the resolution. - Robin Laird | Daily Trojan 
USC Transportation has already said it plans to offer such a service, but USG wanted to emphasize that students support the plan by passing a resolution.
USC Transportation has said it plans to provide free shuttle service to international students three times a day during international students’  orientation, which is before the university’s move-in day.
Tony Mazza, USC director of Transportation, said this program is geared toward international students because they arrive to a specific location at LAX at a specific time.
Shuttles to and from LAX for out-of-state students are also being discussed, Mazza said.
Though Transportation intends to offer the service, there are still details to work out.
“LAX is such a busy place and you can’t just show up there if you’re a bus or shuttle service,” Mazza said. “This program is definitely a work in progress.”
The location and exact departure time of the shuttles is still to be determined, but Mazza said they would probably leave the airport at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. from one of the international arrival gates.
“Students can still take airport shuttles, a bus or a cab, but this will be another option for them,” Mazza said.
USC’s resolution also encourages USC Transportation to increase publication of transportation options and to follow up on providing tram services to out-of-state students.
“As we get a better hold for our fiscal year 2012 budget, we can see if this will fit,” Mazza said.
Mohammad Ani, a freshman from Kuwait majoring in electrical engineering, said this option would have made his trip to USC easier.
“Shuttles would have been nice for me,” Ani said. “This was my first time in the states and I didn’t really know where anything was. Although LAX is full of taxis, a shuttle would help out someone really new since they wouldn’t have to worry if they’re going to the right place.”
Howard Fu, a USG senator who co-wrote the resolution, said he pushed for the initiative because international students brought the issue to his attention. USG created a survey on the subject and brought their findings to USC Transportation.
Eighty-five percent of the people who responded to the survey, which was publicized on Facebook and through listservs, were international students, and 91 percent of all students who responded favored of having a tram from LAX to USC.
“The aim of this is to benefit the entire student body, not just the international or the undergraduate students,” Fu said. “We just had more international students responding.”
USG also concluded that USC should better publicize its shuttle that takes students from USC to LAX before Thanksgiving and winter break, since 53 percent of students surveyed said they did not know about it.
Specific information about the shuttles will be announced over the summer.
“This will be a great way to welcome international students who have maybe not been to the U.S. or USC before,” Mazza said. “They can take the shuttle and arrive right on campus.”

A timeline has been set, an architect has been selected and a tentative site has been chosen for the new Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism building.
The Annenberg Foundation donated $50 million in October to create a new state-of-the-art building on the USC campus.
Change · Students study in the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism’s east lobby. The building will still be used for classes. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
“The planning process has been underway for several months and includes a strategic assessment of the school’s current space, future space needs, existing buildings, what might move to a new building and what might stay in an existing building,” said Joe Back, associate senior vice president for Campus Development and Facilities Management.
This week, DEGW, a strategic business consultancy firm that is working with the Annenberg School to plan the building, held a series of workshops with students, faculty and administrators to get feedback on the beginning design stages of the building.
Feedback from students and faculty at yesterday’s Media Production workshop, which focused on what media production will look like in the new building, included a wish for more collaborative media space and improved spaces for Annenberg student media organizations like Neon Tommy and Annenberg TV News.
“A key focus is that we want the new building to be able to focus on student-produced programs and showcase these programs in the new building,” said James Vasquez, assistant dean of operations at Annenberg.
Technology and equipment updates were another common issue discussed in yesterday’s workshop.
“The broadcast industry is moving so quickly that it’s hard to keep up,” said Sean Patrick Lewis, a sophomore majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. “I’m hopeful that with the new building we’ll not only caught up, but be ahead of the game.”
The workshops have also discussed ways to improve the current Annenberg building, which will remain a part of the Annenberg School. Vazques said, however, that he is not certain how the current Annenberg building will be utilized when the new building is complete.
The site has been tentatively set as the southeast corner of Watt and Childs Ways, next to the Pertusati Bookstore. The Campus Planning Committee of the Board of Trustees must first approve the site after a presentation in April.
Annenberg hired Harley Ellis Devereaux, an architecture firm, to construct the building. Vasquez said firm will be given the feedback from the workshops to help create designs for the new building. Space planning should be completed by September or October of this year, according to Vasquez.
The groundbreaking for the new building is set for June 2012, and construction is expected to take 18 months. The launch of the building is expected to occur in Fall 2014.
In addition to opening more space to bring back various Annenberg centers that have been moved off-campus, such as the Center for Health Reporting, an organization that partners journalists with news organizations to learn about health care in California, the new building will give the current Annenberg building a new sense of purpose, according to Vasquez.
“We expect to be able to bring some of these centers back,” Vasquez said, “and continue to be a fully functioning building that will complement a new location.”
Since Annenberg expanded to encompass undergraduate journalism and communication as well as the existing graduate school programs 16 years ago, the building originally built for 100 people has come to serve more than 2,200 students and 83 full-time faculty members, according to Vasquez.
“For the first time in history, we can build a building that truly showcases what work we do,” Vasquez said. “Here we don’t have the ability to walk into a single location and see what’s happening, and [the new building] will provide an opportunity to share resources, share ideas and be more collaborative.”

Are you wondering who’s hot and who’s not? Which are the best apartments to live in?
CollegeACB, a gossip site where students from colleges around the country post anonymous comments, is sometimes used to discuss simple issues such as where to go for dinner, but recently, rumors, negativity and controversies have been rapidly spreading within college communities because of sites like CollegeACB.
“It’s time to take the ‘anonymous’ out of CollegeACB” is an online movement that aims to bring awareness to the tensions anonymous posts can bring to a college community. Haley Winters, a USC freshman majoring in theatre, launched the movement on CollegeACB on March 21.
“I looked through the site and was shocked at how vicious and cruel people are to one another,” she said. “I was sitting and watching, hoping someone [would] do something about it.”
Since most people post anonymously on the website, users do not face any repercussions after their posts have been made, no matter how hurtful or derogatory their words might be.
Wendy Wood, a USC social psychology professor, said deindividuation, a psychology theory that explains how people behave in ways they normally wouldn’t when they can’t be identified, is a reason websites like CollegeACB can get out of control.
“When people are sitting in front of a computer screen, other people are not physically present in front of them,” Wood said. “If you can’t see those other people, then you can act in ways you otherwise wouldn’t.”
USC students can turn to CollegeACB to know what’s going on around campus, but some find the negative comments to be detrimental.
“It is anonymous and that is what makes it so popular, but it is still wrong.” said Brillante Wang, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “It is technically freedom of speech, but it is also pretty messed up since it is targeting this population to make a lot of negative ideas come out.”
Jordan Leipzig, a freshman majoring in critical studies, said students should be able to recognize when a post on the website is ridiculous.
“It’s better if [CollegeACB] remains anonymous because you get more honest opinions. You can tell what to take seriously and what not to take seriously on CollegeACB,” Leipzig said.
Jessica Frey, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said she finds it disconcerting that students can anonymously post whatever they want.
“In general, the site is a bad idea, but if there was a name attached to people’s posts it would help prevent rude and nasty posts,” Frey said.
According to Winters, an anonymous sites such as CollegeACB are not good for a college community because people make degrading comments about specific individuals and groups. She hopes her movement will reach others who feel the same way and do not support the anonymous negative postings.
“I realized that if I don’t do anything, then it is like I agree with it,” Winters said. “People don’t seem to think they should be responsible for their own work.”
Though often unintentional, the information on a website such as CollegeACB can become viral and quickly create news across the nation. Winters’ movement on CollegeACB comes at a time following various instances that caused controversy after college students made comments online.
First, there was the alleged infamous Kappa Sigma email degrading women, and, most recently, the scandalous photographs of students appearing to engage in sexual activities on the rooftop of a building on campus.
There appears to be a continuing pattern of students making derogatory posts on the Internet, according to Winters.
“There seems to be a problem with our generation,” Winters said. “Cyberbullying is becoming more of a problem coming into college.”
Winters has received more than 200 online signatures of support so far. Not all of those signatures are from USC students, as the movement has also spread to students from other campuses, including Bard College and Cornell.
“The majority of responses have been positive, but there are still plenty of negative ones out there,” she said.
Winters said she has no plans to send this list of names to anyone but only wants to keep the list to remind students that the things they say on the site can hurt others.
“It is about taking a stand as a USC community and supporting the people who have been victimized,” Winters said.
Mars you’re a bit off buddy.  Kids were always mean, true, but the avenues to act like this (like via public message boards) never existed before.  Where do all these terms like “trolling” come from? (it wasnt from Charlie Sheen btw)  Its from people who hide behind a computer screen saying things aloud they’d never want to be held accountable for.  
Look at that kid from Kappa Sig who wrote that email…100/1 odds when he wrote that email he thought it was absolutely hilarious and it was all good, the second that went up on Huffington Post I guarantee you he **** his pants wondering if he was ever going to be held accountable for that and his name would be distributed online.  The embarassment from that would’ve been 10x worse than what any female blogger felt when she read that article because it would haunt him for the rest of his life.
well thanks to the internet, we can talk crap about anyone and we’ll never get held accountable for it
The cover-up continues!
It doesn’t seem like the problem is that this generation is just “meaner”; kids have always been mean, kids have always bullied those they see as weak.  The problem seems to be the victim philosophy this generation has adopted that results in a disproportionately emotional response to what is basically just gossip and name-calling.  Grow some thicker skin for God’s sake!
Grow up. There are so many more means to go about being an ***hole than ever before. It even gives power to those who are weak to act like it – it is a disease.

The Panhellenic and Interfraternity councils devised a two-phase action plan Tuesday night to address the recent issues within the Greek community.
Pat Lauer, the president of IFC, said IFC and PHC created the plan to educate individual chapter members about the severity and ramifications of  their actions.
The plan was created at a meeting held in response to the obscene email that spread virally after being sent on the Kappa Sigma listserv and the photos that surfaced Saturday of a Kappa Sigma member appearing to have sex on the roof of Waite Phillips Hall.
In the short term, IFC and PHC have decided to work with the Women’s Student Assembly and Center for Women and Men to plan initiatives for the rest of the semester. The councils are also requiring 50 percent of each chapter’s members to attend Take Back the Night, an event that raises awareness of domestic violence issues.
“This is something we hope to take a huge part of, not only this year, but in the coming years,” Lauer wrote in an email. “We are excited to work with these organizations because we feel that these partnerships can go a long way in educating our individual members in how to best incorporate themselves into the greater university community.”
Long term, IFC and PHC plan to use social media to educate new members about the “importance of maintaining positive social images.”
The councils will also aim to better hold individuals accountable for their actions and to impress upon members the effects of their decisions.
This approach is absolutely useless.  USC ought to shutdown Kappa Sigma and turn the fraternity house into a rape crisis counseling center and a shelter for battered women.  What an embarrassment to the Trojan family this fraternity is.
The cover-up continues!
Stop spamming this on every DT article about these two stories, you freak.
Who’s bigoted? The greek-haters who see conspiracy-theories everywhere?  The activist TAs who take their students hostage in discussion sections and single out kappa sig based on anonymous internet posts, and without due process or any respect for the principle “innocent until proven guilty”?  The people who promote a “dialogue” only to silence anyone who disagrees with them, based on the fact that “straight white males can’t understand anyways”?  
It strikes me that the white knights who place themselves on pedestals they have created for themselves, and who claim a higher moral ground, are the first ones to stomp others’ civil rights and to behave in aggressive, utterly disrespectful ways.
The only thing that makes me feel good about this whole greek-hate movement is that most people seem to understand that this is only fueled by a minority of grad-student activist-haters from a minority of departments.
> IFC and PHC plan to use social media to educate new members about the “importance of maintaining positive social images.”
+1 missing the point.  -1 for actually addressing the situation.   Even if there’s nothing they can do to discipline the fraternity, the councils could avoid making statements that imply they are just trying to cover up future incidents.
[…] Daily Trojan reported Wednesday that fraternity officials were considering a new program to educate members on the “importance of maintaining positive social […]

The Undergraduate Student Government and USC Hospitality are working to implement an online ordering system for USC restaurants by fall 2011.
The program, which is being tested on the Health Sciences Campus, will allow students to order food online from the Ronald Tutor Campus Center restaurants and pick it up later.
Tim Sae Koo, USG’s director of University Affairs, said this plan was initially proposed because USG saw people waiting a long time in line at the Campus Center.
“Lines were going crazy, people were taking up to 20 or 30 minutes just to get food,” Sae Koo said.
After that realization, USG conducted a survey of undergraduate students and was able to formulate a plan based on the responses.
“According to the survey, everybody really wanted an online system like the one in Chipotle so they wouldn’t have to waste so much time standing in line,” Sae Koo said.
Lauren Perez, a senior majoring in psychology, said she thinks this could help students who don’t have a lot of time to get food.
“This would be really nice because sometimes there are students who work on campus or have classes close together, and they just don’t have very much time to grab food,” Perez said. “This would be an excellent new addition.”
Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, said this program would show the strengths of Hospitality.
“Hospitality already has Lemonade and CPK, which show how we are ahead and above other universities,” Klinger said. “Online ordering is just another example of how progressive Hospitality is.”
Klinger also said this would be an effort that originates right from within the school because computer science students will be the ones to create the online ordering system. Since most of the effort is student-generated, there will be minimal costs to introduce and maintain the program, according to Sae Koo.
Sae Koo said this system would be open to anybody, not just students or faculty.
“This is for anyone,” Sae Koo said. “Basically, the overall goal is to expedite lines to make everything easier and wait time shorter,”
Hannah Goodman, a sophomore majoring in vocal arts performance, said this is a great idea in response to the problem of overcrowding at the Campus Center.
“I think it’s great because there are busy hours where the restaurants at the Campus Center literally have lines out the door, and this would no doubt alleviate some of that wait time,” Goodman said.
Although the plans for system have yet to be finalized, the tentative timeline has the program starting in the fall of 2011 and begin with the restaurants withthe highest traffic.
“The program would start first where the lines are longest, which is CPK,” Sae Koo said. “They are probably not going to launch it at all the restaurants at one time, but will probably see if it works efficiently before expanding,”
“Online ordering is just another example of how progressive Hospitality is.”  Would Mr. Klinger mind elaborating on what exactly makes USC Hospitality so “progressive” as he terms it?  I’m not sure I’ve run into any actual patrons of USC Hospitality who give the organization such high marks.  The cafeterias are notorious for being sub-par in nearly every aspect (and yes, I’ve heard that comment from many people who have frequented other university dining halls).  And while USC Hospitality does give us some nice food offerings in the new Campus Center (Lemonade, CPK, etc.) their hours–especially on weekends–are laughable.  
I would love to see USC Hospitality emerge as the preeminent university dining program, but I don’t think that they’re quite there yet.
can the author clarify this? “The program, which is being tested on the Health Sciences Campus, will allow students to order food online from the Ronald Tutor Campus Center restaurants and pick it up later.” I don’t see this being piloted or advertised to students at HSC at the moment…
@Rich – It is not being piloted at UPC, it is being piloted at HSC first. This is so they can work the bugs out before implementing it at UPC where a much larger group of students would be theoretically be utilizing it.
@Anon thanks for the response. I am a student at HSC and have not seen this pilot program yet
