When your to-do list is getting long, remember the following tips to remain as stress-free as possible. Flickr/Creative Commons
As college students (especially at a high-ranked university such as USC), we are constantly faced with intense pressure and stress to achieve high grades and accomplishments that might bring us closer to our career goals and post-grad aspirations. Whether studying for exams, or preparing projects, presentations, homework, interviews, there’s always an upcoming deadline to face, another task to finish.
In fact, according to an annual survey of college freshman conducted by UCLA’s Higher Education Research Institute, results showed that in the past fall, students believed that their emotional health dropped significantly since they entered college.
With all that happens, how could we not be stressed? Anxiety seems to be inevitable in the college student lifestyle.
After an especially stressful week of school midterms, my father took notice and gave me a book written by veteran management consultant and trainer, David Allen, titled “Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity.” The book discusses the systematic strategies that people can implement to accomplish more, with less effort and effectively work with a clear head and more energy.  One of the most valuable methods that I learned from the book include a five -step strategy for managing workflow and gaining control of your life:
1.)   COLLECT
“In order for your mind to let go of the lower-level task of trying to hang on to everything, you have to know that you have truly captured everything that might represent something you have to do, and that at some point in the near future you will process and review all of it,” writes Allen.
You can capture your to-do list, ideas, and tasks by collecting information in baskets, taking notes on paper and pad, or downloading a useful app called Evernote to dictate important information while you are on the run.
2.)   PROCESS
“You can’t organize what’s incoming — you can only collect it and process it. Instead, you organize the actions you’ll need to take based on the decisions you’ve made about what needs to be done.”
Ask yourself this question, “Can I take action based on this information?” For example, the graduate school you are applying to requires several items: a personal statement and resumé, teacher recommendations, and standardized admissions test scores (GMAT/GRE/LSAT). It’s impossible for you to complete all the requirements in one day, but you can decide what to do first based on the completeness of information. It is probably easier to submit the documents that you have on hand (personal statement and resumé) while waiting for test results to come out and for your teacher to get back to you with a recommendation. Based on your response, you can filter and determine whether or not you can do something about it now, or refer back to it later.
3.)   ORGANIZE
“For nonactionable items, the possible categories are trash, incubation tools and reference storage. If no action is needed on something, you toss it, ‘tickle’ it for later reassessment or file it so you can find the material if you need to refer to it at another time. To manage actionable things, you will need a list of projects, storage or files for project plans and materials, a calendar, a list of reminders of next actions, and a list of reminders of things you’re waiting for.”
Organize actionable items based on their category and priority and set a due date as well as routine reminders so that you can remember to follow up on them. You can use Google Calendar to keep track of things to do and create reminders that are sent to your email or texted to you.
4.)   REVIEW
“You need to be able to review the whole picture of your life and work at appropriate intervals and appropriate levels. For most people the magic of workflow management is realized in the consistent use of the review phase.”
Periodically review the things you need to do, and determine which need adjusting and which you are making progress on. This allows you to consistently be better informed and thus make better decisions.
5.)   DO
“Every decision to act is an intuitive one. The challenge is to migrate from hoping it’s the right choice to trusting it’s the right choice.”
Choose which task you are going to accomplish first and act on it. Productively planning out your schedule, and going through this five step strategy of workflow management will allow you to feel more confident in your actions and decisions and effectively increase your productivity.
If you have a chance, I highly recommend you read this book. The book guides the reader through strategies that teach how to spend less time doing the things you have to do so that you can allocate that time to things that you enjoy.  Next time you can look at your list of things to do, you can spend less time worrying and stressing about the workload, and instead get things done.

Brentwood Country Mart makes for a great day trip to shop and eat to your heart’s content. Christina Nursalim | Daily Trojan
As you enter Brentwood, you will immediately see a plethora of people walking around in their gym outfits (perhaps having just Soul-Cycled), or sipping coffee under a restaurant awning. Quaint little cafes and shops line the streets, and you can easily find places to grab a healthy snack. Brentwood is an affluent neighborhood characterized by its chill “L.A. vibe,” making it the perfect place to unwind during a weekend. Arguably the most popular place in Brentwood, though, is the Brentwood Country Mart, an open-air shopping and food center that first opened in 1948. Rich in history and full of shops and places to eat, Brentwood Country Mart is a must-see for anyone who hasn’t been there. Here are a few worthy places to check out:
1.  Farmshop
Farmshop has a beautiful, classy interior and casual environment, making it perfect for a nice brunch with your friends. Farmshop features a locally sourced menu and serves California-inspired food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Aside from the restaurant itself, Farmshop also boasts a lauded bakery where you can indulge in scrumptious croissants, scones, cookies and more. Farmshop also has a market located inside their restaurant that sells an array of produce and artisanal wine, cheese and chocolate.
2. Barney’s Burgers
Aside from restaurants, Brentwood’s Country Mart also has small vendors around a central courtyard selling a variety of different foods that is much like The Grove’s Farmers Market. One of my favorites is Barney’s Burgers, which has a wide selection of interesting and yummy burgers made with fresh ingredients. They even have over 20 vegetarian burgers, such as the Portobello burger and the Wildwood Organic Tofu burger, so everyone can enjoy their food.
3. Caffe Luxxe
Caffe Luxxe is widely known for its authentic hand-crafted European coffee that has won numerous awards. The cafe has even been featured in multiple newspapers and magazines including the Los Angeles Times and Los Angeles Magazine. Its coffee has a rich aroma and taste and is always made fresh with the coffee beans ground at the time of order and finished off with Caffe Luxxe’s signature milk foam art in the shape of a rosetta. It’s the perfect place to read a book or catch up with your friends, and it’s a must-try for any coffee lover.
4. Sweet Rose Creamery
There’s always room for dessert! End your day with a sweet finish with some ice cream from Sweet Rose Creamery. Sweet Rose Creamery has delicious unique flavors like persimmon, jujube and bacon sundae, as well as more common staples like mint chocolate chip, salted caramel and earl grey. It also has yummy combinations like malted milk with mocha ripple. In addition to ice cream, Sweet Rose Creamery also sells fresh fruit sorbet, ice cream sandwiches and milkshakes.
5. Diesel
Brentwood’s Country Mart has a multitude of clothing stores to shop at (e.g. James Perse, Intermix etc.), but if you’re more of a bibliophile than a shopaholic like me, you’ll definitely want to check out Diesel. Diesel is known for its unique and fascinating selection of book titles. They even have author events where you can meet and discuss the book and get it signed by the author. To know more about the upcoming events, click here. 
So, the next time you have some free time during the weekend, be sure to check out Brentwood Country Mart as an alternative to The Grove. Brentwood Country Mart is highly underrated and will still give you the same type of vibe as The Grove while helping you reach a state of relaxation and during the weekend.

Liberté, égalité, fraternité · Students hold a candlelight vigil Friday for the victims of Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris, France. – Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
A series of coordinated terrorist attacks rocked Paris Friday night, killing 132 and injuring 350 others in what French President Francois Hollande called an “act of war.” According to CNN, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant  has claimed responsibility for eight militants who attacked at least six sites across the French capital. In the wake of these attacks, all USC students studying abroad in Paris have been accounted for, according to exchange coordinators for the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and Marshall School of Business programs.
John Zamora, a senior studying international relations, was having dinner by the Canal St. Martin with several other USC students when the attacks began. At the time, Zamora thought that he heard noises “that sounded like shots,” but recalls dismissing them for something else. Zamora only found out about the attacks later, when the lounge he was in turned on the French news and the concerned calls from family and friends started pouring in.
“At first I didn’t understand the gravity of the situation,” Zamora said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I had many friends and family checking up on me, but I oddly felt fine and not directly in danger. While I feel many other Parisians feel this way, I do feel like people have felt an attack on their culture and way of living.”
Jeremy Serafin, a senior studying business administration, was traveling to Bordeaux, a city about five hours away from Paris, with three other USC students when he heard about the attacks from Facebook posts warning students to stay away from the area.
“Many of the students, including myself, are in a state of shock,” Serafin said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Although our campus is an hour by metro from the city center, many students commute from Paris and visit the city regularly. More than anything, many students are keeping the victims in mind and praying for their loved ones as well.”
Zamora, who lives about five miles from the city center in Neuilly-sur-Seine, said that the atmosphere in the capital is tense.
“While you can still see people out and cars driving past, it’s noticeably less busy than it regularly was,” Zamora said. “The government has asked people to stay indoors as much as possible and people are still mourning — listening to the news to hear the latest updates and for how France will respond. The metro is still running and people have gone to the attack areas to pay tribute to those that lost their lives.”
According to Zamora, USC took measures to ensure that the students studying abroad were all safe and accounted for, and that classes would be held regularly starting Monday morning. However, though the events in Paris may not affect his study abroad semester logistically, Zamora said that he can already feel a change.
“The classes were half of the experience but the other half was meeting the people, exploring the hidden streets and living the culture of Paris — a culture in which the simple enjoyment of life is a central tenet,” Zamora said. “Right now there are a lot of people scared, hurting and angry. It will take some time and more answers for Paris to regain this ‘joie de vivre.’”
Serafin said that though he has not altered his study abroad plans as a result of these events, there have been several logistical changes, such as heightened security on his campus. However, the greatest change has been personal.
“The biggest impact will be a greater appreciation for family and friends,” Serafin said. “All of these devastations around the world are reminders to be more loving and to not take anything for granted. That being said … these attacks have not changed my view of such a beautiful city.”
Zamora said that, due to the politically charged nature of recent events such as the European refugee crisis, the impact of the attacks extends beyond the lives that have been lost.
“The entire world was watching that Friday night, and many people felt confused,” Zamora said. “The Charlie Hebdo shooting 10 months ago already increased the high level of [Islamophobia] in France, and I worry for [Muslims] here who have had no relation to these attacks but will suffer from misplaced prejudice and hatred because of them. I also worry for the refugees and migrants who are just trying to seek a better life for themselves but are intentionally not given this opportunity. I fear it will get worse for both.”

Greek students participated in a cleanup of the Row on Sunday morning, an event jointly hosted by Greeks Go Green and the Department of Public Safety. The cleanup covered the Southeast side of the Row, stretching from Pi Kappa Phi to Sigma Alpha Mu.
Greeks Go Green, a collaborative effort between the greek system and the Office of Sustainability, sponsors green initiatives to incorporate environmental sustainability into greek life at USC. The group was established during the 2013-2014 academic year.
“The Office of Sustainability wanted a way to work with the greek community, so Greeks Go Green created that network for people to be involved both in greek life and sustainability initiatives,” said Joshua Blockstein, co-president of Greeks Go Green and a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.
Sunday’s Row cleanup was preceded by Greek’s Go Green “Late Night Facts and Snacks,” an event on the corner of University Avenue and 28th Street outside of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority house. Members of the organization handed out snacks and presented facts about sustainability, all in anticipation of Sunday’s event.
“We want to raise our profile on the Row and give people a way to contribute,” Blockstein said. “We want to show that the greek community cares about sustainability and the environment.”
The cleanup event on Sunday concluded with an all-Row barbecue located on the lawn of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, with hot dogs, hamburgers and drinks for cleanup volunteers and members of greek life.
“The cleanup had lots of energy, and it was very cool to see everyone getting involved,” said Nathan Chen, a senior majoring in environmental studies. “It was cool to see USC serve as a benchmark for sustainability. This creates potential for a future partnership between DPS and the greek community to further clean up the Row.”
In addition to proactive sustainability events like Sunday’s, Greeks Go Green supports many behind-the-scenes initiatives.
“Our main plan is to have a chapter certification program for all of the greek houses,” Blockstein said. “When a chapter takes a step to become more sustainable, they are awarded with a certain certification rank. We want to motivate houses to become more environmentally friendly.”
Other initiatives held by Greeks Go Green include red Solo cup recycling and an annual thrift shop event. The proceeds, collected from selling sorority members’ old clothing, get donated to Midnight Mission, a homeless shelter on Skid Row.

The USC Interfaith Council held its fifth Annual Student Multifaith Leadership Conference on Saturday at the University Religious Center. The student-led conference started at USC five years ago and has been hosted at other universities in Southern California, making its way back to USC this year.
At the day-long conference, students attended professional and student-led workshops, participated in a “speedfaithing” activity and listened to Antonia Blumberg, a USC alumna and Huffington Post writer, give a speech on her spiritual awakening.
The first set of workshops explored faith’s potential to promote unity between people of different races, religions and cultural backgrounds.
Cynthia Davis, a member of the Bahá’í community in Mountain View, California, spoke on the need for a new narrative regarding interfaith — a need to build a community where people from diverse heritages feel safe discussing their beliefs.
“When we talk about race and interfaith relations, there is a lot of injustice that has happened and stories that need to be heard,” Davis said.
Despite conflicts that have arisen between faiths, Davis believes religion is central to society.
“Religion has always been like glue in our communities and people have always been willing to sacrifice short term and selfish goals for the sake of their faith,” Davis said. “Our spiritual nature is where our generosity lives, our friendliness, our kindness, our forgiveness, and that’s something all major religions have taught.”
After the first set of workshops ended, students partook in a “speedfaithing” activity in which they were introduced to various religions, including Agnosticism, Bahaism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Mormonism.
Students then had the opportunity to attend either a workshop on meditation or on praying the rosary as practiced in the Roman Catholic tradition.
Elaine Krebs, an Interfaith Council Representative from the Caruso Catholic Center, discussed the importance of faith in an increasingly secular world.
“Faith is still important because it takes you out of your [physical] self and connects you to a higher power [that] has more direction,” Krebs said. “Also, different faiths and different religions form community, and community is central.”
After a lunch provided by the Interfaith Council, students attended a final set of workshops on promoting interfaith dialogue on their college campuses, finding meaning in life without religious traditions and reconciling differences in scientific and religious beliefs.
To conclude the conference, Blumberg spoke to students, faculty members and Interfaith Council coordinators about her spiritual journey.
At 20, Blumberg took her junior year off to travel to New Zealand as a member of the World Wide Opportunities on organic farms. In exchange for accommodation and food, Blumberg worked on the farms, selling fruit and experiencing the beauty of the New Zealand landscape.
After buying a bus ticket and traveling throughout the country, Blumberg developed a greater sense of self and began following an earth-based, pagan faith.
Coming back to USC to finish her bachelor’s degree in anthropology, Blumberg said she felt more self-assured and in touch with her spirituality.
“The relationship that you develop with yourself is the most raw and longest standing relationship you will ever have in life,” Blumberg said. “Interfaith is a way of life. It’s an attitude of questioning our own assumptions and habits, noticing the beauty in others and the beauty in ourselves. It’s a way of showing up to life with grace and humility and knowing that the journey begins within, but we can’t walk the path alone.”

The annual crosstown showdown started out in a tight battle, but USC could not hang with the Bruins in a game that they dominated. The No. 4 Trojans traveled to Westwood looking to upset the No. 1 ranked Bruins. The Trojans lost their upset bid by a score of 11-6.
Rain could not deter the Trojan faithful from coming to support, and a sold-out stadium overflowed into the upper levels of a nearby parking structure.
Early on, the action was fierce. UCLA opened with an offense barrage, but sophomore goalie McQuin Baron opened with three straight saves.
The Trojans got on the board first though with a dynamic backhanded goal. On the next possession driver Blake Edwards would score and give the Trojans a two-goal lead. The Bruins would answer on their next two possessions to tie the game at two goals apiece halfway through the first period.
UCLA scored twice more in a first period that saw six total goals.
The Men of Troy struggled to get their offense going in the second period, failing to convert back-to-back power plays. UCLA goalkeeper junior Garrett Danner would finish the game with 19 saves, with 10 of them coming in the first half.
Danner was a force USC could not reckon with and Danner set his new career high in saves.
The Trojans were held scoreless in the second period and gave up two goals to fall behind 6-2 at halftime. The first half was a story of missed opportunities for the Trojans, who failed to convert on any of their five power plays, while UCLA scored on both of theirs.
Despite the scores for UCLA, Baron had seven saves in the first half on his way to recording nine saves.
The Trojans would open the second half winning the opening sprint, but UCLA sophomore Max Irving would net his second goal of the game giving the Bruins a 7-2 lead.
Sophomore Mihajlo Milicevic would end the Trojans scoring drought of over 10 minutes with a goal three minutes into the third period. The Trojans’ momentum would not last long though, with UCLA junior Ryder Roberts answering the goal to maintain the five-goal lead for the Bruins.
Two more goals before the end of the third period put UCLA 10 goals up. Sophomore Matteo Morelli made it 10-4 to end the third quarter.
The story of the game could be summed up in a Trojan power play shot in the fourth quarter that entered the goal but did not hit the net and was saved by UCLA.
The Bruins would go one to score another goal in the fourth period to finish with 11.
Blake Edwards converted a five-meter penalty shot for USC with less than two minutes remaining to make it 11-5.
Freshman Chase Koplow hit the game’s final goal for the Trojans as time expired to take the score to its final at     11-6.
The Bruins were led by Roberts who finished the day with four goals.
USC’s was led by two goals from Blake Edwards and one each for Lachlan Edwards, Milicevic and Morelli on a day when the Trojans’s high-powered offense was stopped in its tracks.
The Trojans’ record moves to 18-5 overall and 6-3 in MPSF conference play. The loss is the Trojans second of the year to the Bruins with the first coming in the finals of the SoCal invitational by a score of 10-9.
Next week, the Trojans will fight for the MPSF championship in a tournament hosted at the Uytengsu Aquatic Center.
Well not a water polo school anymore for this season. Defense horrid,  Coach run out  of sons to give him titles.

On Saturday, OYLS, a Californian, up-and-coming electronic indie band, played at Tommy’s Place as part of an event hosted by Program Board. The duo, consisting of David Kirschenbaum and Michael Lipp, showcased their set of infectious, upbeat songs following R&B artist REL. With James Blake, Disclosure and Ray Charles undertones, the musicians connected with the crowd in the intimate setting.
Kirschenbaum and Lipp met while Kirschenbaum was still a senior in high school and Lipp was attending college nearby at University of California, Davis. After being introduced by a mutual friend, Kirschenbaum and Lipp connected through their mutual love for music.
“For the first couple of years, [Lipp] decided that he was going to be all business, and I would always get really frustrated because he’s really talented,” Kirschenbaum said. “I would always pressure him into making more music. Then, when he got out of a long-term relationship, he was sad, I took advantage and decided that all these emotions could make really great music.”
Kirschenbaum matriculated to UC Berkeley, an hour-long shuttle bus ride away from Lipp, and the two met up for jam sessions. At first, the duo didn’t aspire to make music, but many people encouraged them to pursue the field after they sent their material out. Thus, OYLS officially started, supported by Kirschenbaum and Lipp’s ability to work well together. Lipp takes on the lyrics, while Kirschenbaum is in charge of production. Songwriting, on the other hand, is split down the middle. Like any team, their collaboration isn’t always a smooth process.
“We fight sometimes, and other times we get along really well,” Lipp said.
All in all, the musical group features much cohesion. Lipp and Kirschenbaum both set out to do the same for their audiences.
“We put in 100 percent in all of it,” Kirschenbaum said. “We will keep at our ideas and see them through. More than anything, we love each other.”
With a couple years of creating music under their belt,  the band has made headway with their tracks “Maps” and “Dots and Dashes,” which they performed for their engaged audience at Tommy’s Place. The songs spotlight Lipp’s moving lyrics and Kirschenbaum guitar acumen. Moving at this rate, Lipp and Kirschenbaum detailed their visions for the future.
“We want to be huge,” Lipp said. “We want to create genuine music that comes out organically and comes from ourselves.”
According to Lipp, OYLS will release a single by the end of the year and an EP by early 2016. At the end of the day, however, Lipp and Kirschenbaum do not lose sight of what is important to the band.
“I think music is super cool because I don’t feel greedy for making it,” Kirschenbaum said. “I feel like people are drawn to music because they like it, and it’s definitely a unifying agent because we all grow up on it. It’s so weird to think that someone makes it, so it’s that that will always make us feel inspired by music.”

Pandamonium · Sophomore Peter Bergmann shows off an oreo donut from California Donuts in front of Doheny Memorial Library. – Photo courtesy of Peter Bergmann
Peter Bergmann, a sophomore majoring in mathematics and economics, has been eating his way through Los Angeles. His Instagram, @BergmannBites, is not just a place where he posts pictures of food, but also where he can connect with other local foodies. Bergmann, through an online platform, is fashioning a community.
Daily Trojan: Tell me about your Instagram and why you started it.
Bergmann: I started my Instagram about five weeks ago, so it’s relatively new, but it’s a normal food Instagram with a combination of my photos and photos people send in to me that I credit them for in the caption. My photos are mostly from around L.A., but when I go elsewhere I’ll post from there. I am a very, very big fan of food and very passionate about it. I love to eat. I actually look up menus for fun. This fall semester seemed like the perfect time to follow my dreams and make an account. My friends gave me good support when I started it, and it was exciting to get people besides my friends starting to follow me. I love connecting with other food Instagrams and restaurants that I tag in the photos. There is definitely a greater food community that lets me learn more than I thought I would.
DT: When did your love of food emerge in your life?
PB: To be honest, it’s actually died down a little bit, which is kind of weird to think about. When I was a kid, my thought process was, “What am I having for my next meal?” I would be in the middle of class as a fifth grader watching all my classmates excited about math or geography, and I was just like “What’s for lunch?”
DT: Why share your adventures for food on Instagram?
PB: Instagram was a risky choice because people will call me basic for taking a brunch picture or standing above the table to get the angle for the shot. People will tell me to be present and just enjoy the food. But for me, taking pictures is part of my experience. I don’t take pictures of just my food; I take pictures of everybody’s food. I genuinely love recording it. I record my meals on an app on my phone. The reason I chose Instagram is because I want to share my passion with the world. I could talk about food and describe the meals I had for hours. Additionally, the food community on Instagram is something I’ve discovered through hashtags and it’s allowed me to come into contact with all different types of food lovers, which is really exciting for me.
DT: What is the last place you went that sticks out in your mind?
PB: I went to Jack n Joe’s for the first time this week, [and it] is a classic. I also went to Eggslut last weekend which is another popular spot in Grand Central Market. However, my favorite so far has been The Counter which is in downtown Los Angeles. I had one of the best burgers of my life there. It’s called the Red Eye. It had medium rare meat, fried egg, bacon, Sriracha chili sauce. It was really good.
DT: How do you take the perfect food Instagram?
PB: A lot of people like to do the angle from above and those are nice especially when you have a really colorful plate. Personally, I’m a really big fan of the close shot at a downward angle. I joke with others that I only got an iPhone for taking pictures while hiking and of the food I eat, which is not that much of an exaggeration actually.

Move over, Justin Bieber. One Direction’s highly anticipated fifth album, Made in the A.M., hit shelves on Friday. Sadly, after the sudden departure of former band member Zayn Malik, One Direction officially became a foursome. Harry Styles told USA Today that Made in the A.M. is “the best album we feel we’ve done.” And the new album proves that’s the case.
Since the X Factor days, I have followed every move, word, tweet and Instagram post from the boys. This time, though, One Direction is saying goodbye. Because there was a huge publicity blitz around Bieber’s Purpose, it was tough for the boys of One Direction to promote their new album when everyone had already marked their gravestone, especially in the wake of Malik’s exit and the group’s announcement that they’re taking a break. Brushing off the rumors, the remaining members have tried to keep up their musical growth since the release of Up All Night in 2011.
Made in the A.M. is the kind of record that the world’s biggest boy band makes when it’s time to bid farewell. Made in the A.M. is One Direction’s Abbey Road. The album has Beatles-influence written all over it. With a more mature and rock influenced sound, A.M. highlights the band’s many charms — sharp hooks, tight harmonies, playfulness and melodramatic anguish. The reggae spirit and guitar riffs of the lead single “Drag Me Down,” took me by surprise and left me less bothered about Malik’s departure.  I asked myself, “Could this really be One Direction’s new sound?” It sets the pace for “Perfect,” the second single and my personal favorite. “Perfect,” is an alleged Taylor Swift kiss-off and a typical One Direction pop anthem.
A.M. is full of sensitive breakup lyrics, as evident in “History” — “Hey girl, before you go, let’s toast the mini bars, expensive cars, hotel rooms and new tattoos / The good champagne and private planes.” The boys slow it down with the heartbreaking ballad “Long Way Down.” Ballads “Infinity” and “If I Could Fly,” are sweet too, yet sound like rehashes of what they boys have already done with fan favorite “Night Changes.” But after crying my eyes out with the last two, “Never Enough,” is a fast tempo song that sounds like it came straight from the ’80s and shows off Liam Payne’s impressive notes.
If Made in the A.M. does end up being One Direction’s final album, I would be disappointed. Indeed, it is a step up from last year’s folk-pop Four and the rock vibe of Midnight Memories, but it’s not quite as enjoyable as their first two albums. Not going to lie, if you are expecting a Take Me Home 2.0, you might be disappointed. The boys show no signs of slacking; they co-wrote nine out of the 13 songs on the album. If anything, they are showing they are getting even better. However, Made in the A.M. follows the same moral as every other One Direction album — teen fan girls are the only ones that matter. When you are a male singer, or a group of male singers, you have to give those girls what they want, since they make you or break you.
Since the band will not be touring this album, I wonder which songs would be the most likely to be performed live other than “Drag Me Down,” and “Perfect,” which were added to the set list for the end of the band’s On the Road Again tour. Honestly, any of the 13 songs would be amazing live. They are all good tunes. It’s sad to see another boy band disintegrate. Fame came quickly for One Direction. In less than three years I had the opportunity to see them live twice in venues increasing in size. Who knows what their musical legacy will be, but faithful fans -— including myself — are willing to follow them in whatever direction they are going in.

On move-in day at the beginning of every fall semester, thousands of wide-eyed freshmen, armed with over-packed boxes and anxious parents, begin the complicated process of living with roommates in dorms or suites. The living space allows students new to the University to gain some independence while fostering social interaction, and resident assistants help them navigate the not-so-savory parts of living with often random roommates.
For a generation that’s increasingly social and accustomed to comfort, dorm-style living is a dream. It’s no surprise, then, that the emergence of Commonspace — coined “dorms for grownups” by The Atlantic — has been touted as the solution to a problem of lonely millenials looking for cheap rent and companionship.
It’s definitely easy to see the appeal of Commonspace on a financial level. With the skyrocketing cost of tuition translating into massive student debt and a decreased value of higher education, millennials are struggling. So the $700 to $900 monthly rent for Commonspace in Syracuse looks marginally better than the $630 to $1,060 monthly rent for three-bedroom units in the area. And we actually prefer to share our space — it allows us to bring our social lives into our personal ones.
Commonspace takes into account that young people today, with the rise of social media, more often live shared experiences. We work together, study together and eat together — and we want to live together. And as a result, millennials may find traditional apartment-style living isolating. Moreover, as technology provides us with constant connection, our social, professional and personal worlds are never truly separate. Just as phone notifications show up from Facebook, so too do work emails pop up after hours — and technology allows us to never really leave work or social obligations behind. And never being separated from the perpetual ping of responsibilities makes us more geared toward a lifestyle of multitasking. A more social living situation allows us to keep the constant connection with our peers that we crave.
It’s easy to see why someone would be doubtful about whether Commonspace would actually work and whether millennials are really prepared to stay in a college-like social setting. After all, one of the millenial generation’s biggest faults is that we’re increasingly viewed as immature and narcissistic — not exactly the type of people who would benefit from being around each other. And yes, young people are more social and are used to instant gratification, so we might not always be as prepared for maturely dealing with interpersonal relationships. For millennials, who have grown up with more screen-to-screen than face-to-face interaction, the difficult conversations are made even more difficult. So when “social engineers,” as the creators of Commonspace call them, play the role of resident assistants, they lessen the social burden of living with others by helping residents navigate complex social interactions.
Regardless of whether it will work, it’s much more difficult to answer whether Commonspace should work. Dorms for grownups could seem like hand-holding for a generation increasingly seen as coddled. But millennials need support — facing an erratic job market and a host of pressures that come with starting independent lives, we need others to guide and mentor and, yes, party with us. And we don’t just need people around us — we want them, too, as we become more conscious of how mental health affects our lives.
Dorms for adults may seem silly. But just as millennials have transformed every other industry — be it technology, education or arts — so too, will they reconstruct the housing sector to create models that will cater best to their needs. Whether we like it or not, the way millenials lives is changing. Maybe naysayers just need to deal with it.

Designer Troy Evans has redefined the meaning of life after college — by bringing dorm living into the adult world. Earlier this month, Evans debuted his downtown Syracuse floor plans for dorms for grown-ups, or, as Evans likes to call it, “Commonspace.” Twenty-one microunits, each packed with a tiny kitchen, bathroom and bedroom, surround a common area. With many residents sharing one living space, the aim for which is to reduce loneliness in millennials. In actuality, coliving fosters an unhealthy mindset in which people are unable to accept newfound independence.
Granted, there are many benefits to coliving. It’s a surefire way to develop a sense of community, since close quarters force people to get to know one another better. There’s also the financial draw — compared to the $1,500 per month average renting price in downtown Syracuse, Evans’ housing option costs significantly less, only $700 to $900 a month. To top it off, Evans accounted for the fact that most college grads come from homes with luxurious amenities, so his designs also factored in style.
However, the natural progression for many people after college is to finally live on their own. To reside in, as Evans put it, “a neighborhood in a building,” would be a reversion. Though Evans maintains that each microunit is ensured with the utmost privacy and allows for residents to choose the level of interaction with fellow roommates, this situation really isn’t the best of both worlds.
Living alone trains people to develop tangible skills. When an appliance breaks down or the fire alarm mysteriously goes off, my first inclination is to run to my roommate and ask her how to fix everything. If I lived by myself, which is what I plan to do after graduation, it would propel me to face these issues without depending on another person. Though these tasks are menial, solitary living inspires one to become self-sufficient.
Indeed, some studies do suggest that living with others decreases risk for depression. But after graduation, when life will undoubtedly become more hectic with career responsibilities, it can be freeing to come home after a long day and not be concerned about the needs of other people. If need be, loved ones are always a quick FaceTime or phone call away, so there’s really no need to live in confined spaces with people that might not be your favorite.
Most glaringly, this housing model ignores the introvert. Some people feel most at peace with themselves alone but might find the frugal rent outweighing the costs. In a society that advocates for networking and socialization and altogether supports the extrovert more, it would be more innovative to draft a plan that would allow introverts to also benefit from social interaction.
With many people crowded in one space — a continuation of college-style living — it might excite some for its inclusive and money-friendly qualities. On the other hand, coliving has major drawbacks, especially in the development of individualistic people. So, leave the dorms to the college students and explore solo-dwelling after college.

The third year of coach Andy Enfield’s tenure at the helm of the USC men’s basketball program is underway, and for the first time in the last four years, the Trojans look like a competitive Pac-12 basketball team. This is not to say that the team is going to contend for a conference title this year or make a run to the tournament — though they could surprise some people — but this year’s squad [will] be in most of their games.
This is a wild improvement from where they have been, especially over the first two years of Enfield’s time at USC. This is not a make-or-break season for the young coach if they show some positive signs of improvement. However, if there is no upward trajectory and they again finish in the bottom of the Pac-12, I don’t think he makes it to his fourth season.
The good news for him, and Trojan basketball fans in general, is that this team has shown some signs of forward progress. The team is currently 1-0, with a 40-plus point blowout win over the University of San Diego in its opener. A big win over a weak non-conference opponent normally isn’t cause for celebration, but USC’s players flashed major glimpses of potential on Friday.
Part of the problem in Enfield’s first two seasons was an absolute dearth of talent on the roster. The Men of Troy did not field a team the last two years that was filled all Division I caliber players. This year, they finally have. Enfield’s last two recruiting classes are finally starting to pay some dividends for the program.
The two highly touted freshman recruits, Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright, both appear to be immediate contributors to the Trojans’ front court. Metu, a local product out of Lawndale, has the length and raw athleticism to be a potent force on both offense and defense. With a 6-foot-11 frame and great speed for his size, Metu fits Enfield’s offensive mold perfectly. He still needs to fill out and add some bulk, but that will come with time. His raw skillset allows him to be a contributor from day one.
The other half of the freshman duo, Boatwright, is another tall and lanky forward. Unlike Metu, who does most of his work down low, Boatwright has the ability to space the floor and score from outside as well. For years USC has floundered from beyond the arc, but the combination of Boatwright and an improved Katin Reinhardt and Elijah Stewart may allow the Trojans to finally space the floor a little bit more.
If the first game is any indication, sophomore swingman Elijah Stewart is vastly improved. Stewart closed last season out on a run, playing phenomenally well in an upset over Arizona State in the Pac-12 tournament. Last season, the versatile swingman demonstrated a knack for lockdown defense while also demonstrating his ability to beat his man off the dribble and attack the paint. This year, it appears he has added a reliable jump shot to his arsenal, making him even more effective.
In addition to Stewart, sophomore point guard Jordan McLaughlin also has added new dimensions to his games. The most prized recruit of the Enfield era thus far, McLaughlin dealt with injuries and struggled to adjust to the speed of the college game last year. Even so, he still managed to put together a respectable debut season, and now that he has a better feel for the nuances of Division I basketball, he can put his considerable talents to better use.
Rounding out the Trojans’ squad are some of the now upperclassmen who have been around for a few years. Reinhardt, guard Julian Jacobs and big man Nikola Jovanovic all have developed nicely in their time at USC. Reinhardt appears to have added muscle over the summer and worked on his shooting mechanics with Enfield. If he can develop into a consistent and reliable threat from deep, the Trojans will greatly benefit.
In addition, Jovanovic gives them a formidable presence  who the Trojans can feed for some easy baskets in half court offensive sets. The forward has developed a couple of excellent moves in the paint, and will be a double-double threat every time he steps onto the court.
This early part of the season is a pivotal stretch in Enfield’s time at USC. He doesn’t need USC to compete with Duke and Kentucky. He just needs to lead a competitive team that has shown marked signs of improvement. If he can do that, most of the rational Trojan fan base will be happy with his work.
