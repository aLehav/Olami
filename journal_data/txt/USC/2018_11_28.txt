Mireya Medina is meticulous about every dish that comes out of her kitchen. As head chef of the popular campus restaurant Moreton Fig, Medina makes it a priority to use only the freshest ingredients, whether for a kale caesar salad or a side of basil pesto butter. Fortunately, she has been receiving some help.
For the past two years, Medina has been working with a local farm just minutes away from Trousdale Parkway. In fact, it’s so close that every shipment of produce can be carted by foot to the various campus establishments the farm serves.
Managed through a partnership between the University’s hospitality department and produce growers LA Urban Farms and Lettuce Grow, the USC Teaching Garden is a small space hidden behind the Radisson Hotel on Figueroa Street. Utilizing aeroponic farming technology, the facility plants and harvests various crops without soil. 
For Medina, the campus operation reflects changing attitudes about health, food and environmental sustainability, as well as the University’s unique role in the push for farm-to-table methods. 
“We’re thinking about the future … this is the way that it should be — [because] everything we get is as pure as it can be and not genetically modified, [the food we serve] is a lot cleaner, healthier and tastier,” Medina said.
But it wasn’t always like this. In 2015, USC Hospitality executive chef Eric Ernest approached his boss, Kris Klinger, with an idea: What if USC became a leader in sustainable dining?
After conducting research, Ernest reached out to Niels Thorlaksson and LA Urban Farms founder Wendy Coleman to determine how the University could create a self-sustaining garden within the vicinity of its urban campus. Coleman, a USC alumna, suggested converting the space behind the Radisson, while Thorlaksson offered his expertise in aeroponic farming. A plan was then set in motion.
“It wasn’t about a money-saving operation for us,” Klinger said. “It was about having the flexibility to grow what we want, when we want to grow it in reason — and grow more unique and better products.” 
With 60 vertical towers and several thousand plants to start, the USC Teaching Garden commenced operations in April 2016. Over the last two years, growers have planted over 80,000 crops of different varieties — harvesting an average of 2,800 every month. 
Farm Manager Kevin Dutton believes that the aeroponic farming technology used at USC is both space efficient and environmentally conscious, despite setbacks. By recirculating water using pumps embedded within them, the towers save 94 percent of water typically used for each plant. 
“In a normal environment, you could go out into a piece of land, plant some seeds. As long you get water there every once in awhile, you’ll have a garden,” Dutton said. “Here, we depend on water and electricity, but we’ve made better use of it.” 
At the USC Teaching Garden, between 660 to 880 plants are delivered to the Radisson, Moreton Fig and Lab kitchens within minutes after harvest every week — and without any food miles accrued.
“We’re trying to take care of our students and be proactive about the food we serve,” Medina said. “It’s beautiful to say that we grew it, we’re using it, people are eating it right here.”
The symbiotic relationship between USC restaurants and the garden extends beyond supplying greens. According to Medina and Klinger, chefs at each restaurant typically develop and create three seasonal menus a year.
While USC chefs typically request different types of greens according to menu selections, the season is a key factor in determining which crops to grow. Dutton said that because of California’s warm and temperate climate, there is more flexibility in what can be grown in the towers.
However, unforeseen challenges in the past have forced growers like Dutton and Thorlaksson to experiment with other options.
“The mark of a good chef is someone who can take anything and cook anything you throw at them. Sometimes, when we try out different varieties [of crops], when we do different things, when we have a failure and we have to plant something we wouldn’t normally plant, they’re good with cooking it,” Dutton said. “They seem to utilize all of the stuff we give them, and I think that’s a sign of a really good partner and a really good cooking team.”
In 2017, the National Association of College Auxiliary Services recognized USC Hospitality for its efforts in creating and managing the garden with a sustainability award. With the project’s success, Klinger said that USC has become a working model for other universities such as Caltech and UCLA, both of which have visited the facility. 
“We’re going to look into ways to use [the garden] to contribute to campus’ sustainability goals even though that’s something we didn’t think much about when it was created,” Klinger said.
For Medina, the current partnership between Moreton Fig and the USC Teaching Garden is an opportunity to show to the greater Los Angeles community that USC is leading the way in changing perceptions about food and sustainability. 
“Pretty soon, chefs from around the city are going to say that chefs at USC are making a change, and caring about the kids and the community,” Medina said.

Despite whatever carb-fearing reputation Los Angeles may have formed, the city’s affinity for things on toast stands in stark opposition. L.A. might not be the birthplace of toast, nor the master of toast, but there is a citywide obsession with creating — and consuming — a perfectly composed piece of bread. What was once a mere side dish has transformed across breakfast joints into a filling, relatively cheap breakfast, an outlet for creativity and flavor experimentation.
While there is an abundance of great toast in Los Angeles, four have carved their way into the fabric of the city, each becoming icons in their own way: the avocado toast from Dinette, the crunchy french toast from Blu Jam Cafe, the chicken liver toast from Animal and, of course, the ricotta toast from Sqirl.
Dinette fits into a distinct genre of cafe with its modern design, selection of brunch fare and glass partition showcasing a near-erotic display of baked goods. A similar restaurant concept is employed all across Los Angeles, often without consideration for the surrounding neighborhood — a gentrification machine. However, what Dinette lacks in uniqueness it makes up for in toast. 
The avocado toast at Dinette is a painting of greens and whites, a balance of creamy and crispy, a dance between sharp and smooth. Chunky avocados rest on a fresh slice of sourdough bread, garnished with radishes, salt, cilantro and various spices. Each bite feels like a piece of destruction — this one of those dishes that is too beautiful to eat. 
Dinette’s avocado toast may not be a singularity across restaurant menus, but it’s certainly one of, if not the greatest avocado toasts in the City of Angels.
On Melrose Avenue, people are waiting in line outside a completely different type of storefront. The line for Blu Jam Cafe is always immense, probably due to an intersection of hungry shoppers trying to find a good place to eat and people coming for the french toast. Blu Jam has a rustic atmosphere, with wood paneling and soft lighting, but its menu is filled with familiar breakfast items. 
The best breakfast in L.A. is home to by far the crunchiest french toast, presented on a long rectangular plate and dusted with powdered sugar. Brioche is battered in corn flakes and cooked until crispy, topped with fruit and a runny vanilla sauce. Beneath its crusty shell, the french toast is soft and flavorful, amplified by the vanilla and not too rich to fill up on before finishing. It is the perfect midday break from shopping, and one of the best brunch options in the city.
Animal is the furthest place from a typical toast cafe, but that’s because Animal’s offering isn’t typical toast. For years now, Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo’s meat-centric restaurant has rocked the L.A. dining scene, shattering the rest of the country’s expectations of Angeleno cuisine. The menu ranges from tamer selections like turkey legs and pork belly sandwiches to pig ears and chicken hearts — all mouth watery. Toast, without a perfectly balanced meat, would perish on this menu of extremes. But thankfully, it has that in the chicken liver toast. 
The fattiness of the chicken liver mousse bursts across the tongue, cut by a tangy shallot jam and punctuated by the subtle char of the toast. In a way, it feels like an avocado toast with its balance of creamy, salty and crunchy — but the chicken liver outshines any seasoned avocado. The chicken liver toast at Animal laughs in the face of all other toasts, not only because it is one of the best toasts in the city, but also because it turns chicken liver something into something worthy of craving.
But in the end, there is only one best toast. The toast to rule them all. A toast symbolic of breakfast in Los Angeles, of everything loved and loathed in the city. It could only be the ricotta toast from Sqirl. Slathered in a layer of fresh ricotta and painted with a smattering of house-made jam, a thick piece of brioche toast smirks from its plate. It knows it’s good — so good that people will wait an hour in line to try it. Sqirl is a perfect example of Angelino cuisine: gourmet but casual, packed but irresistible. And its toast shines across SilverLake.
Of course, L.A. took the humble toast and transformed it into something grandiose. It gave toast the celebrity treatment and groomed it into a beautiful, unattainable icon. No reasonable person will strategically place radishes across a piece of avocado toast at home — that’s why Dinette does it. Fancy toast is a representation of the American Dream, the result of a slow and steady climb up to fame and popularity. Toasts at the restaurant République cost anywhere from $11 to $21 now. If that’s not a rags-to-riches tale, I don’t know what is.
In a time of stress and change, toast is a comfort, built off a foundation of unchanging bread, despite its bells and whistles. There are times when even a cutthroat city like Los Angeles seeks comfort in sturdy dishes like the simple toast. Thankfully, there are plenty of places to get it.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
This week, the Daily Trojan launched “Speck of Green,” a news series exploring the topic of environmentalism at USC. Given the spectre of climate change and the undeniability of its effects and existence, we saw an opportunity to engage with the campus community about our role in combating the greatest modern threat facing our planet. 
California is no stranger to climate change strategy and activism, having implemented statewide measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Working both domestically and internationally, the state leads the nation in ambitious programs to combat climate change. 
USC — an institution that touts itself as a global leader in thought and innovation — has a moral obligation to do its part in California’s charge toward environmental sustainability. 
In 2015, the University launched the Sustainability 2020 Plan, a campus-wide effort organized around seven core goals and initiatives. As the titular deadline year fast approaches and the plan’s already-modest goals remain hardly within reach, it’s time for USC to reassess its position of privilege and set a prime example for Los Angeles and the rest of the world.
One of the areas in which the University has excelled is in how it manages its largest facility — the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
In 2015, USC implemented a zero-waste program for the football stadium for both Trojans and Los Angeles Rams games. In 2017, it won the Pac-12 zero-waste competition after diverting more than 90 percent of gameday waste during its annual “Green Game” and became the largest NFL stadium and second-largest college stadium to achieve zero waste. This season, the Coliseum has achieved zero waste in two out of three USC games in which data was made available. 
As highlighted in the series, USC is also home to a student-organized housing operation focused on environmental consciousness, as well as a self-sustaining garden that grows and delivers produce to various campus establishments. 
Despite all the praiseworthy endeavors the University has undertaken thus far, there is still a lot of room for improvement. 
While the Sustainability 2020 Plan is a commendable first step, it is simply not enough. Most importantly, it does not demonstrate a robust commitment from the senior leadership level to addressing the pressing challenges of environmental degradation in a manner that reflects USC’s capability given its immense power and resources. 
Whether through letters to the editor, on-campus activism or peaceful demonstrations, USC student organizations have consistently indicated their allegiance to combating climate change. Similarly, in a letter published in Wednesday’s edition of the Daily Trojan, members of the Academic Senate Committee on Sustainability voiced their support for the student groups who took the lead in calling on the University to bring its promises to fruition.  
The University must do better engaging students, who are vital components of the environmental movement on campus. Beyond facilitating transparency of its goals and providing practical education, the administration must collaborate with outspoken student groups — including Environmental Core, Environmental Student Assembly and Undergraduate Student Government — to include student perspectives and more effectively implement meaningful change. 
As students, we must mobilize and lobby the University, as well as other institutions that are beholden to us, to take responsibility for their environmental impact. Above all, students must make changes in their own lives by engaging in sustainable practices like separating recycling and compost; reducing emissions by using public transportation and walking or biking whenever possible; and minimizing food waste by consuming locally sourced produce and fewer animal products. Students must always be diligent and informed consumers and producers — and put pressure on the University to do the same.
We understand that the University is busy dealing with a host of administrative issues implicit to running a world-class institution that include a string of faculty scandals and consequent lawsuits. But this is no excuse to ignore the looming dangers facing our increasingly run-down planet: As the global environmental crisis reaches a critical point, it becomes undeniably clear that everyone must focus their time and energy on sustainability. It therefore falls on the University to prioritize the allocation of its resources, do its part in educating its students and fulfill its duty to future generations. 
With “Speck of Green,” we join the call in imploring USC to reevaluate its progress toward its current sustainability goals and urging senior University leaders to explicitly assert their support for longer-term, practical and aggressive reform — lest we regret not doing more to save our only home.

Throughout the semester, I’ve used my column to highlight shortcomings in American education. But as college students in a major city like Los Angeles, USC students are uniquely situated to make a real difference for the children attending school just blocks away from campus. So for my final column, I want to explore a few of the ways you can get involved on campus to help change students’ lives by improving their education at an early age. 
Troy Camp
While the organization is best known for its annual “Pass the Can” fundraiser and titular summer camp for elementary school students, it also provides consistent mentorship and teaching opportunities to serve children at all grade levels in South Los Angeles schools. 
While the summer camp focuses on outdoor activities, the USC students who serve as counselors meet with their mentees throughout the year, encouraging them to pursue higher education and providing them a source for support outside of their family and teachers. 
In addition, Troy Camp serves elementary school students through afterschool programs. The Student Mentoring and After School Help program provides 90-minute sessions to help students with homework and encourage them to pursue creative projects, while specialized programs sessions focus on extracurriculars like creative writing or science. 
The Leaders in Training program sees USC students develop leadership skills and prepare them for high-school level courses. Similarly, the TC Leads program provides support for high school students, preparing them for college applications and teaching them career development skills. 
Jumpstart
This early education organization holds a special place in my heart — I served in the Jumpstart corps at USC last year, and it was one of the most rewarding college experiences to date. 
The program does require a significant time commitment: Corps members spend 10 to 12 hours each week working for the program, with an additional seven spent working directly with children in the classroom and five preparing materials and lesson plans for students. 
Jumpstart emphasizes literacy — each week, participants go into a preschool classroom with fellow corps members (each team is comprised of four to six USC students), read a corps storybook to students and conduct lessons and activities inspired by the book. 
The program has a strong focus on building vocabulary and comprehension skills, developing basic writing skills and strengthening phonemic and rhyme awareness in the 3- and 4-year-old children Jumpstart serves.  
While it is volunteer-based, Jumpstart also qualifies for work-study, and students who complete the program can earn a scholarship through the national Americorps organization.
By developing relationships with college students in academic environments, Jumpstart children see improved language and literacy skills that persist throughout their K-12 education. 
Science Outreach (SCout)
Although USC’s campus has its fair share scientists and engineers working on groundbreaking experiments and innovative technologies, students in the elementary school classrooms neighboring the University often don’t receive science education until fourth grade. 
SCout seeks to change that by bringing educational but exciting science projects into second and third grade classes. Students get to learn cellular biology through extracting DNA from strawberries as well as robotic circuitry through robots built from toothbrushes and small motors. Exposing students to scientific discovery early on in their education allows them to see themselves as the STEM majors that’ll one day be working on new science exploration at USC. 
SCout is a two hour per week commitment, with one hour spent in the classroom and one hour spent preparing for sessions in SCout general meetings. 
USC’s campus is filled with opportunities for exploring exciting fields and volunteering for countless service programs, and education is no exception. Seeing the bright faces of students eager to learn and knowing that your presence in their classrooms can inspire them for years make education service not only important for community development but personally beneficial as well.

Sunday night’s rout of Nevada marked the women’s basketball team’s fourth blowout win of over 20 points. It looks to notch its seventh win in its undefeated season against  Fresno State Wednesday at home.
After losing its first game of the season in opposing territory, Fresno State (3-1) has managed to regroup, winning the last three games with the average margin of victory around 15 points.
In each of those three wins, the Bulldogs were led by some iteration of sophomore forward Maddi Utti, sophomore guard Bree Delaney and senior guard Candice White. The trio accounts for 42 of the team’s 71 points per game.
The trio will face its toughest match to date, as Wednesday’s matchup against USC will be the Bulldogs’ first road game since their season-opening 86-73 loss to Northern Arizona and their Power 5 opponent of the 2018-19 season. 
In her five years as head coach of Fresno State, White has a 1-5 record against Power 5 opponents; her last win came in 2014-15 against Oregon. The 2014-15 season was also the last time White and the Bulldogs squared off against USC, losing 68-56. White knows the obstacle ahead of her team is one they’re not accustomed to facing. 
“We are going to go down and play really a hard, quick and athletic team down at USC,” White said. “I just want us to have poise and confidence walking in there.”
There has been a lid on the basket for all USC opponents this season, as the Trojan defense has yet to allow the opposition to come close to shooting 40 percent from the field. The Women of Troy are sixth in the nation in defensive rankings, limiting opponents to less than 50 points a night. 
Although not as elite as the defense anchored by senior point guard Aliyah Mazyck and junior point guard Minyon Moore, the Trojan offense is far from run-of-the-mill. Thanks to the double-digit scoring averages of Mazyck, Minyon Moore, senior guard Mariya Moore and redshirt freshman guard Shalexxus Aaron, the Trojans have been blowing opponents out.
“National attention is great, but I really don’t care about that,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “We’ve just got to keep playing well and keep up what we’re doing. We can’t become distracted.”
The lack of national recognition surrounding the Trojans comes with the fact that their undefeated season has come while facing opponents with a combined 12-24 record. However Trakh and Co. will have ample opportunity to prove that their hot start is more than just an easy out-of-conference scheduling. 
“It’s not going to get any easier, as you see how hard our schedule is going to become,” Trakh said. “All of a sudden, we’re going to start playing teams like Texas A&M, UCLA, Cal, Stanford, and Oregon.”
Tip-off will be 5 p.m. at Galen Center Wednesday.

Redshirt senior guard Shaqquan Aaron protects the ball against Robert Morris on Nov. 6. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Men’s basketball hosts Long Beach State University Wednesday night as the Trojans look to move to 5-2 on the season. USC is coming off a 90-75 win over Cal State Bakersfield on Sunday where it overcame the absence of guards redshirt junior Derryck Thornton and freshman Kevin Porter.
The Trojans have already faced injuries to key contributors, like senior forward Bennie Boatwright and freshman guard Elijah Weaver, which have made it difficult for the team to find an identity to start the season. 
“[Boatwright is] a huge threat,” Weaver said. “As soon as they see Bennie step on the floor, they’re always going towards him heavily. Just having him on the court creates a lot of open lanes for people.”
Despite the injuries, USC has been one of the best offensive teams in the country so far, albeit against some below-average competition. Still, it’s encouraging that the Trojans are shooting 50.4 percent from the field and 40.9 percent from 3-point range, ranking No. 23 and No. 29 respectively.
“I think [shooting is] pretty natural within the game play,” Weaver said. “Our coach is just trying to get us to penetrate and kick. We just knock ‘em down.”
Long Beach State presents an interesting matchup, opening the season with a competitive 91-80 loss to UCLA, a team ranked as high as No. 17 this season. However, that effort looks less impressive now that the Bruins have dropped out of the rankings following bad losses to No. 11 North Carolina and No. 9 Michigan State in the last week.
Other than that, Long Beach State hasn’t been impressive, with only two wins and three losses by at least a 15-point margin. This is a game the Trojans should win easily if they can avoid the slow starts that have plagued their season thus far.
The 49ers only shoot 40 percent from the field, are average from behind the arc at 35.3 percent, and have a negative assist-to-turnover ratio of 86-to-123.
Long Beach State does average 10.9 offensive rebounds per game, a potential problem for a Trojan team that allows 12.2 offensive boards per contest. USC will need to hit the defensive glass to dominate this game the way it should.
“We’ve been working on it  in practice, trying not to get in foul trouble and boxing out everytime,” sophomore forward Victor Uyaelunmo said. “I don’t really know how we’re going to stop [LBSU’s dribble penetration],  but we just have to do a better job of playing defense and being the gap, being in the right position so we don’t get in foul trouble.” 
Senior guard Deishaun Booker is the focal point of the 49er defense, as he leads the team in both scoring and assists. Booker is not a great outside shooter, but can get to the line and knock down free throws, averaging 7.1 attempts per game and making 94 percent of them.
Booker’s ability to break down a defense could be an issue for the Trojans, who struggled to contain penetration against Cal State Bakersfield. Quick guards who can get into the paint draw fouls on rotating defenders, and foul trouble has been problematic for USC in the early going.
“It’s our defense,” redshirt senior Shaqquan Aaron said. “Just got to lock down on the defense and play together as a team. When we play together as a team, we have fast starts, everyone’s running and playing good, locking down on the defense.”
The Trojans and 49ers tip off at Galen Center at 8 p.m. Wednesday.

On Sunday, USC Athletic Director Lynn Swann made the announcement that many in the USC community feared. 
“Clay Helton is our head coach and will continue to be our head coach,” said Swann in a statement. “I am a strong advocate of consistency within a program, sticking by a leader, supporting them and helping them and their team improve.”
Helton will get another chance to prove he can turn USC back into a national powerhouse. In order to do so, Helton has already made drastic changes on his coaching staff. USC announced that offensive coordinator Tee Martin, defensive line coach Kenechi Udeze and defensive backs coach Ronnie Bradford are no longer on the coaching staff, while quarterbacks coach Bryan Ellis has reportedly taken a job at Western Kentucky. 
At times, I’ve been a staunch supporter of Helton, singing his praises after an unlikely Rose Bowl win in 2016 and a Pac-12 title last season. But after a season in which USC lost to Cal, Arizona State and UCLA, finishing with its first losing record since most current students were in diapers, it’s hard to say where the program is headed. Discipline both on and off the field is even more concerning than the 5-7 record. Of 130 FBS teams, only six were penalized more the Trojans, and the midseason departures of underclassmen Levi Jones and Bubba Bolden signal a lack of leadership on all fronts. 
Issues of discipline and culture — which to Swann’s credit were spelled out in his press release — will be the most difficult problems to address. But USC’s inept and downright frustrating offense can be fixed immediately with the right hire at offensive coordinator. 
This year’s combination of Martin and Helton calling plays clearly didn’t work (Helton took over play-calling duties from Martin after the Arizona State loss). At the season’s end, the Trojans are tied for 90th in scoring offense, averaging a measly 26.1 points per game. They amassed just 382.6 yards per game of total offense — which is basically a solid Sam Darnold game during his days at Troy. Even during USC’s last losing season in 2000, the team eclipsed 400 yards per game, averaging 415.9. Then-head coach Paul Hackett was fired after the season ended. 
I believe in the development and progress of JT Daniels. I really do. His rookie season wasn’t always smooth sailing — by any stretch of the imagination — but that can happen to a true freshman starting quarterback in a major conference. Look no further than USC’s Matt Barkley, who posted nearly identical numbers as Daniels when he started as a true freshman in 2009. Then, Barkley tossed 15 touchdowns, with 14 interceptions and a 59.9 completion percentage. This season, Daniels had 14 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, while completing 59.5 percent of his passes. To say Barkley outgrew his early struggles is an understatement. He would ultimately become the school’s all-time leader in passing yards, a record he holds to this day. 
Daniels, too, possesses the physical abilities to morph into a top-level passer. That’s why USC needs to bring in a true quarterback whisperer and offensive innovator. This person needs to be able to transform one of the most unwatchable offenses in college football into a juggernaut within the span of one offseason. He needs to help Daniels move from raw prospect to star. It’s certainly no easy task. 
As the college football coaching carousel starts to turn, there aren’t many available names who fit those requirements – except one. Kliff Kingsbury was recently fired as Texas Tech’s head coach, following a 5-7 season (Swann should take notes). Before Texas Tech, he developed a sterling track record as an offensive coordinator at Houston and Texas A&M. With his air raid philosophy, Kingsbury has coached a 5,000 yard passer in Case Keenum at Houston, a Heisman Trophy winner in Johnny Manziel at Texas A&M and a current NFL superstar in Patrick Mahomes at Texas Tech. Despite his lack of overall success at Texas Tech, the Red Raiders ranked in the top-five in scoring offense in 2015 and 2016. At every stop of his career, Kingsbury’s offenses have been potent and his signal callers have flourished. 
Given his offensive acumen and ability to coach up young quarterbacks, Kingsbury will be highly sought after as an offensive coordinator. He’s already been linked to his mentor Mike Leach at Washington State and the returning Mack Brown at UNC. 
Therefore, USC needs to do everything in its power to land Kingsbury. The school may not have enough money to eat Helton’s buyout, but it certainly has enough to make Kingsbury one of the most, if not the highest-paid offensive coordinator in the country. The departed Texas Tech coach won’t remain in the coordinator ranks for long.
Swann gave Helton another chance, against all odds and conventional wisdom. He needs to return the favor by making a slam-dunk hire at offensive coordinator. It doesn’t get more slam dunk than Kingsbury. He may be the only coach capable of extending Helton’s stint as head coach.

Grace Cillo | Daily Trojan
Here’s a guilty pleasure I don’t often admit: I love reading advice columns. It is not the most scholastic of pursuits, but everyone needs an occasional dose of schadenfreude, and the entertainment value can’t be matched. The sordid extramarital affairs, the difficult, demanding siblings, the scheming mother-in-laws — oh, those incorrigible mother-in-laws — I eagerly lap it all up, wrapped in the smug, self-righteous knowledge that I’m much too smart and savvy to ever find myself mired in such situations. 
Some of the columns I enjoy include The New York Times’ “Social Q’s,” which bills itself as “lighthearted advice for awkward social situations,” and has elicited a chuckle out of my usual stony-faced Internet-browsing expression. New York Magazine’s “Ask Polly” is another great one, even if Heather Havrilesky’s replies tend to err a bit on the garrulous side. But my absolute favorite column, one that I check religiously, is Slate Magazine’s “Dear Prudence.”
I started reading “Dear Prudence” nearly five years ago, when it was helmed by Emily Yoffe. Yoffe assumed the Prudie identity in 2006, and still represents, for me, the ideal advice columnist: She possesses compassion in spades; she is stern but kind when addressing letter writers who are clearly in the wrong; she sprinkles her answers with a dash of humor and sass. Her words of wisdom are always gracious and thoughtful. Honestly, I’d want Yoffe to be my second mom. 
In 2015, after nearly a decade in the role, Yoffe handed the reins over to Daniel Mallory Ortberg. Predictably, long-time readers, averse to change, protested. Some squawked at his age; he was 28 when he landed the gig. He is also a lot more hip than Yoffe, sporting multiple lip piercings and a fashionable undercut. But Ortberg does an admirable job as Prudie. He takes a straightforward, no-nonsense approach to advice, but he is just as considerate and generous as his predecessor.  
I’m very selective about the media I pay for, but I eventually caved and took out a subscription to Slate just so I could access the bonus content; all the good questions are under lock, for Slate Plus members only — those sneaky bastards. Ortberg also hosts a podcast called “Dear Prudence Uncensored” with Nicole Cliffe, who is the “Care and Feeding” columnist and answers questions regarding how to wrangle young children. 
Reading advice columns almost feels like rubbernecking. The letter writers lay bare every squalid detail of their predicament, emboldened through the use of goofy pseudonyms like “Jonifred” and “Jimothy.” Whenever I’m in a bind, I turn to “Dear Prudence,” and am always reassured that no matter how dire the straits I’m in, there are people out there who have it a lot worse. 
Life is truly a rich and colorful tapestry. The plights people manage to get themselves into never cease to amaze me. “Dear Prudence” is a snapshot of the human experience, with all its strains and stresses, woes and joys, fears, hopes and dreams. More riveting than any fictional movie, it is unparalleled in its ability to make you laugh, cry or wince in sympathy.

With Cheesecake de Granger, Louisiana native Sacha Granger delivers cheesecakes in the form of cupcakes to hungry customers. The strawberry cheesecake cupcake is one of her most popular. (Anokhi Kholwadwala | Daily Trojan)
In Sacha Granger’s eyes, beauty comes in ordinary things. 
She finds beauty in driving in L.A. traffic to deliver the frosted pink cheesecake cupcakes she makes for her online business, Cheesecake de Granger. 
“Going to different areas that I’ve never been and stumbling upon a gem in the neighborhood gives me an opportunity to explore the area,” Granger said.
Granger established her online dessert business in 2012, choosing to forego a brick-and-mortar storefront to minimize overhead costs. She has since worked to gain a customer base and expand her business. Along with ordering online, customers can also go to Hot and Cool Cafe on Degnan Boulevard to try her cheesecake cupcakes. A recent partnership with Uber Eats and DoorDash will also make her products more easily accessible.
Granger  decided to serve her cheesecakes in cupcake liners instead of by-the-slice due to the growing popularity of bite-sized desserts, which are more appealing in a health-conscious state like California, and easier to manage at large events, she explains. 
But despite the desserts’ small size, they pack a full punch of flavor — the strawberry cheesecake cupcake carries the scent and taste of freshly picked strawberries, while the mango cheesecake cupcake has more subdued, tangy flavors. 
The whipped cream that tops the cupcakes contains fresh bits of strawberry and adds to the  texture of the cake, standing out from a classic frosting. The crust is crumbly and crisp, while the cheesecake itself is smooth, light and fluffy — easily  dissolving against the roof of one’s mouth. 
Granger’s signature light and airy touch is distinct from that of competitors.  
Cheesecake de Granger customers also can select from more than  65 recipes online, all of which are freshly prepared and delivered to order without any frozen ingredients or preservatives. Granger’s creations  come in whimsical flavors, from peanut butter and jelly to root beer float to sweet potato pie. She’s currently working on perfecting a Thai tea cheesecake, a flavor inspired by her love of the classic drink.
“Whatever hits me when I’m walking, or something that I eat or taste on a daily basis —  that’s what I try to make a cheesecake out of,” Granger said.
Granger had no intention to start her own business. But after getting laid off from her job at a food testing lab, she realized she needed to rethink her source of income, and looked back at her family’s entrepreneurial history for motivation. 
She describes her family as mostly self-employed; her grandmother owned a restaurant in Louisiana, while her father and grandfather both owned their own family carpentry business. 
“I’m kind of the late one because they’ve been doing it since their teenage years,” Granger said. “But I knew eventually I would branch out on my own … I think this is what I was made to do.”
She attributes her love of baking to her grandparents, who taught her how to cook for “boucheries” in their home state of Louisiana — large neighborhood gatherings that centered around a butchered pig but also involved other side dishes, like hundreds of her grandmother’s sweet potato pies.
“Some of the things that my grandmother put in her sweet potato pie, I put in my cheesecake,” Granger said. “I take different components from what I’ve learned by watching and I add my own little twist to what I do.”
Granger tries to complement her business with community involvement. She’s currently working on a partnership to donate desserts to homeless people.
“Even though you’re online, you can meet people and branch out and do things to help the community,” Granger said. “We all have to help each other.”

Conscious community · Eco-op is an environmentally themed cooperative house, complete with a vegetable garden in the back. Here, residents help each other maintain an eco-conscious lifestyle. (Thomas Forman | Daily Trojan)
CeCe Uhrich and Tim Buchanan live in a two-story house on 28th Street with eight other USC students. Their shelves are filled with items bought in bulk and their basement is home to a compost pile. A small container of dollar bills sits on a table near the front door serving as the ecotax collector when one of the residents succumbs to an Amazon Prime two-day shipping temptation or a Postmates delivery, both of which cause extensive paper and plastic waste.
Uhrich and Buchanan live in USC’s Eco-op, an environmentally-themed “cooperative” house near campus. Throughout the year, they open their home to USC students by hosting vegetarian potlucks once a month along with other green-themed get-togethers.
On a normal evening, the residents are sprawled on the couch or seated at the wooden table in the living room finishing last-minute homework, snacking on food or catching up with one another. Sundays are devoted to check-in time as each reflects on the “roses” and “thorns” of the past week.
As a team, the 10 students focus on promoting and camping sustainable lives.
“It’s a place for people who are frustrated by roommates who don’t recycle,” said Uhrich, a senior majoring in environmental studies and environmental science and health. “People who want to share with each other and be actual friends with each other and care about each other is one huge aspect of it, and I think that’s really the pull. Then the second level is everybody should care about sustainability and just other important things in general.”
Eco-op focuses on small actions to encourage sustainable living. Students in the house buy reusable products, refrain from using paper towels and share food to ensure nothing goes to waste. They also restrict toilet flushing to limit water use.
“Every kind of every aspect of your life has to change if you want to live a sustainable lifestyle,” Uhrich said. “So, it’s kind of just always listening to each other’s ideas and suggestions … being willing to sacrifice a little bit of your personal comfort for sustainability.”
Buchanan, a senior majoring in environmental studies, said joining Eco-op helped expose him to more environmental issues.

“I came from New Jersey where environmentalism is more pollution,” he said. “I grew up by the ocean, [so] protecting it from that side I knew very well, but there’s a lot more to it than that, obviously, that I got into when I got out here to school.”
Uhrich said the recurring potlucks give students a chance to build a community and learn from one another.
“We want to be able to meet each other’s friends and have a place for those friends to meet other friends,” she said. “Potlucks usually ended up being a pretty good place [to meet people] because people will come alone and not know anybody and bring their dish and then meet somebody from that and end up talking all night.”
In past years, Eco-op has also hosted gardening and compost workshops. Uhrich said she hopes to host one about sustainable fashion this year.
When the Eco-op was originally created, the house was also home to chickens and a large garden; however, students found it difficult to care for the animals because of their busy schedules, plus their management company built a new structure in the backyard, cutting down the space available for planting. Since then, Eco-op members have restarted a smaller garden to grow kale, parsley and broccoli.
“[We try] to be self-sufficient to some extent in terms of food so you don’t always have to rely on Ralph’s,” she said. “Then, at the same time, vegetarianism, veganism — we try to promote that too, not only within our house but also when we host events.”
Though not everyone living in the house is vegan or vegetarian, all students are more mindful of the food they consume, Buchanan said.
“It definitely helps me to think about reducing as much as possible and learning how to cook better with less impactful sources,” he said. “Not only less meat but when you do meat focusing on the chicken side of the spectrum rather than the beef, knowing where you’re sourcing things from and just cooking better meals that taste better but have a lower impact.”
Unrich said she enjoys the diversity of community within the Eco-op, something she will miss once she graduates.
“Not everybody’s on the same major, and not everybody feels the same way about things,” she said. “It’s always good to have some different ideas to make each other better.” 
Though Eco-op is not currently part of the Environmental Student Assembly, it hopes to be next semester in order to get more involved.

We write in response to the letter you published on Nov. 20 from Tianna Shaw-Wakeman, Milena Castillo-Grynberg, Olivia Pearson, Claire Mauss, Catherine Atkinson (who wrote as representatives from Environmental Core, Environmental Student Assembly and Undergraduate Student Government). We are members of the Academic Senate’s Committee on Sustainability, and we want to express our support for the ideas and feelings expressed in the students’ letter. We also want to express our thanks to these students and to the organizations they represent for taking the lead in calling on the University to step up to our responsibilities as an institution.
The challenges posed by climate change and other environmental disruptions are already massive and are destined to grow in magnitude and intensity over the coming years. However, as portrayed so eloquently in the student letter, the sad truth is that USC has only made tiny steps in responding to this challenge. We have yet to respond in a way that reflects our capability and our responsibility. We have many facultymembers, students and staff who are doing their best to help the University live up to our aspirations and obligations, but without leadership from the top — the Board and the President — we cannot get far. USC aspires to be one of the world’s leading universities, and this requires that we take a leadership role in the environmental arena.
We therefore join the call from these students in urging the Chairman and President to articulate an ambitious longer-term strategy and an aggressive timeline for reaching the overarching goals of net zero water, net zero waste, net zero carbon, sustainability education and research as well as full transparency in developing a plan for reaching these goals and in assessing our progress toward them.

Dariel Fillomeno | Daily Trojan
Critics of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s pursuit of the House Speaker position don’t have a problem with women in leadership positions — they have a problem with this woman in a leadership position.
The predominantly white, male “progressive” push to replace Pelosi and her eight-hour filibuster for immigration reform, as well as her successful, Herculean quest to pass health care reform that granted millions of disproportionately low-income, minorities insurance coverage lies in her lack of progressive ideas. Instead, the lineup of potential alternative Speakers includes a slew of centrist, unremarkable white men. They have never filibustered for immigrant children for eight hours in heels, nor overcome the jarring odds and sexist attacks that Pelosi faces to deliver a slew of successes for the American middle and working-class.
Pelosi, fresh from ushering in a blue wave of unprecedented numbers of women, will be the next Speaker of the House. And the conflict over her leadership starkly reflects the elusiveness of female likability — certainly in politics, but also in society at large.
The reality that many people in this country still do not “trust” women leaders, or find women leaders “likable” and, especially among young people, deride young vocal feminists as “social justice warriors,” is obfuscated because these same people will claim to have no problems with women as a unit. But they will routinely criticize individual women and refuse to acknowledge a pattern in what they dislike about each one.
Despite lawsuits against President Donald Trump, dozens of sexual misconduct allegations and refusal to publicly share his tax returns ahead of the 2016 election, it was Hillary Clinton whom most Americans said they could not trust. Her email server and the Benghazi scandal have all been replicated in some even more dangerous, outrageous fashion by the Trump administration, but the president’s core base has not even flinched.
The jarring double standards in likability, in perceptions of trustworthiness, intelligence and belonging are magnified in today’s political landscape. We live in an age of uniquely potent gaslighting that suggests women have already maxed out in equality, so that the passive-aggressive sexist subtext we continue to face is easily denied by its perpetrators. And in turn, our reactions to buzz words and micro-aggressions, each of which tell us we do not belong, are weaponized against us: If we respond, we are hysterical and overly sensitive.
Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever to be elected to Congress, cannot share a candid home video including a slip of the tongue about the chambers of government without being called “simple” and unintelligent by critics, many of whom adore Trump’s ignorance as representing his “anti-establishment” brand. She can’t speak about her experience being mistaken for an intern or Congress member’s wife without being aggressively fact-checked. She can’t put together a nice outfit without being decried for dishonesty about her working-class background and upbringing.
Of course, the policing of Ocasio’s wardrobe speaks to classist notions that poor people do not deserve “nice things.” Additionally, juxtaposed with conservatives’ adoration of Trump’s financial success and opulent displays of wealth, disdain for Ocasio having the audacity to walk around Capitol Hill wearing a nice blazer underscores how many traits seen as “likable” and admirable in men can be damning in women.
Watching the aggressive nit-picking and petty criticisms of Ocasio’s every move has been a visceral experience for me. Ever since my political awakening in the latter years of high school, when I first began to write about and report on feminism and current events in a professional capacity, I couldn’t share my work or any articles about the issues without being condescendingly asked if I had even read the article (sometimes, even if I had written it). I couldn’t talk about my experiences with sexual harassment without facing compassionless interrogation from my peers — many of whom often perpetuated the very harassment and sexism they aggressively denied existed — about whether I could name and detail specific incidents.
I felt consistently forced to feel ashamed that my activist work and writing were performative stunts for “attention,” that my vocal feminism after years of, at times, traumatic harassment was a selfish front for me to “justify being a slut.”
At some point, I gave up on my pursuit of being liked — holding my tongue when boys around me would use homophobic or racist slurs, being a silent observer of the misogyny and subtle manifestations of intolerance in the behaviors of men around me.
Men who say they take issue with Pelosi but not women politicians in general, men who claim to respect women, but just not that woman, say they aren’t asking for much from women to like us. But what they ask of us is nothing short of everything — that we remove ourselves (or at least our opinions) from public spaces, that we sit back and be quiet observers and consumers of their lives, rather than speak up and fight for our own.
The critiques of every aspect of how Ocasio conducts herself, and visceral male hatred of women like Pelosi and Clinton, are broad messages to American women at large: that we are too emotional, unintelligent and ultimately, too female, to occupy spaces of power, to speak our minds and be heard and certainly, to speak our minds and be liked.

Sen. Shayan Kohanteb’s (far right) proposal to allow senators to endorse specific candidates in the next USG election was voted down at Tuesday’s meeting. (Krystal Gallegos | Daily Trojan)
The Undergraduate Student Government voted Tuesday to approve next semester’s elections code. Senators will be required to remain neutral on candidates running for open positions, and an amendment proposed prohibiting all USG members from endorsing candidates failed to pass.
Sen. Shayan Kohanteb first proposed an amendment that would have allowed senators to endorse candidates in the next USG election. Kohanteb argued that senators lend a valuable perspective to USG elections since they know the inner workings of the Senate better than anyone else. 
Sen. Michaela Murphy was the first to raise issue with Kohanteb’s amendment, arguing that allowing senators to endorse candidates would contribute to nepotism within the Senate. She said that favoritism has been a problem in the past. 
“USG reached a point not many years ago where internal nepotism … had seemed to spiral so out of control that a [School of Cinematic Arts] student literally made a documentary about internal nepotism in the organization and how it impacts USG elections,” Murphy said.
Several people from the Senate and gallery expressed concern that senate aides have an unfair advantage if senators are permitted to endorse candidates.
Last year was the first year USG broke precedent, allowing senators to endorse candidates in an informal agreement among sitting senators. Sophomore Truman Fritz, USG’s associate director for marketing, said that this may have produced a fairer election than those in past years.
“There were six senate aids last year who were elected — there were also three who weren’t,” Fritz said. “I would like to argue that that was because of their platforms and not because they were senate aides.” 
He also said that experience within USG is not a necessary prerequisite for holding office as a senator, as long as the candidate can properly represent the student body.
Sen. Max Geschwind claimed that senate endorsements could actually increase voter turnout.
“I think we should have faith that students will vote intelligently,” Geschwind said. “We shouldn’t think that just because a certain senator adds their name to a particular candidate … [students] won’t blindly vote.”
After confirming the elections code, the Senate unanimously voted to confirm an amendment to USG’s diversity fund, which would allow for the creation of an oversight board democratically elected by USG’s cultural assemblies. There will now be a process for individuals or organizations to apply for access to the diversity fund through the new oversight board. 
Murphy and former USG director of community affairs Mai Mizuno authored the amendment and Senators Manda Bwevervu and Meagan Lane co-sponsored it.
Before the amendment was passed, the executive board of USG decided who would receive access to the diversity fund and there was no formal application process, according to Murphy.
“If we use the belief system that … where we put our money is a reflection of our values, then that is a very strong statement to make to the USC administration to say that what we value is diversity-based initiatives,” Murphy said at a USG meeting about the diversity fund in October.

Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks at a 2009 USC commencement ceremony. (Daily Trojan file photo)
The USC Schwarzenegger Institute will debut a class on environmental policy next semester taught by former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Christian Grose, an associate professor of political science and public policy. The course, titled Environmental Policy from Idea to Passage, will teach students how state environmental law is proposed, developed and implemented in the United States’ legislative systems.
The course focuses on California law and the efforts previous politicians put into enforcing environmental regulations, according to Grose. Specifically, it is meant to provide insight into the machinations of the Global Solutions Act 32, a bill enacted by Schwarzenegger during his governorship that aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state.
“We thought it’d be a great idea to offer a class to look at the landmark bill to teach students about environmental public policy specifically,” said Grose, the academic director of the Schwarzenegger Institute. “We want to teach students about the theories and ideas around policymaking and the politics of the policy making process.” 
Schwarzenegger emphasized the importance of teaching students about environmental policies, in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
“I am incredibly excited to team up with Senator Fran Pavley and professor Christian Grose to teach a course on the policy and politics of the landmark Global Warming Solutions Act,” he wrote. “The law established California as an environmental leader and showed the world that sub-national governments have the power to act when national governments refused to do so.” 
The spring class was developed by Schwarzenegger and Conyers Davis, the director of the Schwarzenegger Institute. According to Davis, the class is a culmination of previous outreach efforts and partnerships with politicians like Schwarzenegger and former California State Senator Fran Pavley, who will be a guest speaker. 
“Arnold runs the Schwarzenegger Institute, so he’s going to be one of the lead professors, and he was instrumental in the policy and the politics that brought it into fruition the Global Solutions Act 32,” Davis said. “The Environmental Policy Director Senator Fran Pavley was the author of the legislation. So it seemed kind of like a no-brainer to us, if we have these two amazing policymakers affiliated with the University, that we wouldn’t tap them to teach a course.”
The class will also feature guest speakers.
“When we discuss the legislative process, we’re going to have multiple legislators who participated in the bill making,” Grose said. “We’ll invite a few people who were national leaders, international leaders … and there could be a panel of two or three people on a particular topic.”
Davis said the class is important given California’s current climate issues, especially with concerns surrounding the state’s handling of environmental disasters like the Camp Fire. He and Grose hope this class can inspire students to be active in the lawmaking process.
“This class is going to basically be kind of a history of this bill and help create a guidepost for how you might make policy in the future,” Grose said. “We’re hoping students will also be engaged with ways that they can seek to make changes themselves.” 
Schwarzenegger said he is enthusiastic about the future of this course, hoping that the students who take it will become inspired to promote change. 
“I think this is an important lesson for all future policymakers to learn and I think it is fantastic that the Schwarzenegger Institute is offering this course,” he said. “I look forward to being back into the classroom and meeting the next generation of leaders.”

 Students rally · Members of the Environmental Core rally in 2016, asking the USC administration to place more emphasis on sustainability on campus. (Daily Trojan file photo)
For Milena Castillo-Grynberg, climate change isn’t an abstract concept, but a real threat — one that USC has the power to combat. 
As co-director of the Environmental Core, a group of students eager to turn concern about the environment into concrete policy changes on campus, Castillo-Grynberg has been pushing for increased sustainability on campus for years. This Friday, she’ll take part in a rally to demand that the University do its part in curbing rising global temperatures that increase the risk of environmental disasters, and conserve valuable resources before they run out.
USC shares the same goals — at least on the surface-. In 2015, the University created its Sustainability 2020 Plan, a road map for how it wanted to become more environmentally responsible, outlined in seven major categories. Three years later, some goals have already been met, while the progress of others has been halted, and campus officials continue to monitor the latest developments. 
But for student activists and others who have pushed for USC to reform its environmental policies, the plan was never enough to begin with. Instead, they’re demanding that the University expand its vision to achieve net zero water use, waste and carbon emissions, as well as focus on sustainability education and research as well as full transparency on its environmental policies. 
Students like Castillo-Grynberg, a junior majoring in environmental studies, see USC as a civic leader that could propel the entire city toward a more sustainable future, if it places a priority on doing so. 
“We’re always talking about how USC has so much influence [and is] such a huge player in Los Angeles,” Castillo-Grynberg said. “If the city’s regulations aren’t meeting what the University wants, [USC] should be using its influence to push the city to pass policies that allow us to meet our goals.”
Progress reports
The Sustainability 2020 Plan aims to improve the University’s focus on sustainability in seven categories: education and research, engagement, energy conservation, transportation, procurement, waste diversion and water conservation. Each category has several goals which the University is meant to meet by the end of either the 2020 calendar year or the 2020 fiscal year, which ends in June 2021. Since the plan was approved by the President, the Provost and senior administration, the Office of Sustainability has sent out periodic updates on the progress of each goal.
According to Mark Ewalt, the executive director of administrative operations, 25 percent of a goal’s progress is just developing a plan for achieving it; once funding is approved, that goal is 50 percent complete.
Currently, only the transportation category has achieved 100 percent of its goals: a reduction in single occupancy vehicles, measured using a self-reported survey. According to Ewalt, USC gets the information from a report the University is required to submit to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. The survey is sent to all staff and faculty and asks by what mode of transportation they used to get to work over the past week. 
Ewalt said the University considers the transportation goal 100 percent complete because the number of people who reported using a single occupancy vehicle to get to campus fell from 56 percent in 2014 to 49 percent in 2018. USC also created a website that offers directions to places in L.A. using transportation methods other than SOVs, such as the LA Metro and Urb-E scooters.
“We didn’t set a specific goal for that because we couldn’t measure it as finitely as we wanted to and we weren’t sure that we could even control it at all,” Ewalt said. “We’re still not sure we can control it.”
The Office of Sustainability has placed a priority on the waste diversion category, with its goal of diverting 75 percent of the University’s waste 56 percent complete as of August. To meet this benchmark, USC has begun installing recycling bins around campus and sorting its waste into recyclable and non-recyclable parts. 
Other objectives, however, aren’t as far along — its energy conservation goal is 47 percent complete and its water conservation goal is 33 percent complete. The goal of reducing water usage by 25 percent will most likely not be met by 2020, according to Ellen Dux, programs manager of the Office of Sustainability. The University was relying on the city to build a recycled water program called the “purple pipe,” but it likely will not reach USC until at least 2024.
Student critiques
For student environmental leaders on campus, such as Environmental Student Assembly  co-Director Olivia Pearson, the Sustainability 2020 Plan doesn’t go nearly far enough. Pearson, a senior majoring in environmental engineering, sees it as a form of “greenwashing” — painting the University as environmentally sustainable on the surface, without making any truly meaningful changes. 
“The goals that they say they’re achieving are still a little vague and kind of just greenwashing the whole thing because they did not really outline very thorough metrics for what they were trying to meet,” Pearson said. 
Castillo-Grynberg agreed, saying that it should not be the students’ responsibility to lead sustainability initiatives on campus. 
“We’re students and we have our classes and we have a lot of other things to worry about,” Castillo-Grynberg said. “We just generally have been feeling like the University should be hiring professionals.”
Castillo-Grynberg said it has been frustrating to not see enough changes on campus despite all the time and effort she has invested.
Pearson said the University is using excuses to “brush off the pressure” of becoming more sustainable. While she agreed that there are some things out of the University’s control (such as the purple pipe program), she said that there are other things USC could already be doing to improve sustainability on campus, like removing single-use bags from restaurants on campus like Seeds. 
Looking forward
Some groups at USC are already planning how it can move beyond its 2020 goals, as the Academic Senate proposed a Sustainability 2030 Plan that was approved by the Undergraduate Student Government and the Staff Assembly. Ewalt praised the Sustainability 2020 Plan for creating a framework for campus sustainability, which did not exist before 2015. However, he admitted that the blueprints for the 2030 plan seem like another “laundry list” of goals rather than a holistic look at the University’s environmental policies. 
“The next [plan] needs to be a lot more aggressive, it needs to be comprehensive and it needs to be something on the level of a city plan,” Ewalt said. “It needs to be something where everything we’re doing makes sense with the University environment, it takes very accurate assessment of what USC’s capabilities, what its own aspirations are [and] what the condition of the physical planet is in.”
Ewalt said a charter proposal has been submitted to the upper administration at USC to create the next sustainability plan. Once approved, Ewalt said creating the next plan will involve a representative from every group on campus, including students, faculty and staff. 
“It’s a really unique time at USC right now,” Ewalt said. “Everybody’s minds are open and possibilities are really out there. I think everybody’s really open to having this dialogue in a way that we haven’t been before.”
Ewalt is pushing for a professional consulting firm to aid in the creation of the next sustainability plan. 
Pearson said the next plan must have goals, but must also include a “game plan” to achieve those goals. A good plan, according to Pearson, would show that the University has been strategic and invested time and resources into sustainability. 
“I think as long as we look within our own perspective and make goals that are ambitious for us,” Pearson said. “I’m just asking for us to really push ourselves and not just do what L.A. is going to make us catch up to anyway — to show that we want to be a model for the community.”
