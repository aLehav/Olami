Over the past several months, construction projects such as the University Village have made significant changes to the University Park Campus — however, the Health Sciences Campus has also undergone a process of expansion. The Malcolm and Barbara Currie Residence Hall, a new student housing complex at the Health Sciences Campus, opened for graduate students at the end of July, according to USC News.
The hall has 178 residential units and features a fitness center, swimming pool and barbecue grills as well as an “academic success center” that provides computers, printers and two study rooms. The units, which can house around 450 residents total, were entirely booked by the end of May, according to Samantha Grande, the assistant general manager of Currie Hall. 
“Currie Hall was built in order to have another housing option on campus,” Grande said. “We only had one other on-campus housing complex, so a lot of students were finding housing off campus. With enrollment growing, we wanted to accommodate that.”
Students feel that the new facility is an upgrade from the other housing complex in HSC, Seaver Residence Hall. Magdalena Borisov, a graduate student in the Keck School of Medicine of USC, said that students can access more services in Currie Hall than in Seaver, where she lived last year. 
“Everybody [in Currie Hall] has their own departments. Everyone has their own washing machine and dryer and a kitchen,” Borisov said. “At Seaver, there were only three washing machines and dryers, so it’s definitely more convenient here. There’s more for what you pay.”
Currie Hall has experienced some minor difficulties with its infrastructure. On Aug. 4, days after it was finished, a faulty pipe flooded four apartments, according to Grande. The Hall is managed by American Campus Communities, so USC Facilities Management Services was unable to help with maintenance. 
Despite these difficulties, Currie Hall remains a welcome addition to the Health Sciences Campus, where the last major construction project, other than a parking structure built in 2015, took place in 2009. 
“It’s very convenient, [and] I like how it’s very cozy it makes me feel at home,” Borisov said. “There are a lot of areas for students to study if I want to study with my friends. There’s free printing, and during the night, there’s security.” 
Currie Hall was named after USC trustee Malcolm Currie and his wife Barbara, who donated $10 million to Keck and the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience. It is part of a $35 million project aimed to renovate HSC, according to USC Transportation. The project plan includes four main objectives: opening a 200-bed hotel known as Hyatt House for students, remodeling the Norris Health Care Consultation Center, constructing a clinical building dedicated to cancer treatment and beautifying the streets in and around HSC.

Two USC Viterbi researchers have been recognized in the MIT Technology Review’s Innovators Under 35 on Tuesday.
Roboticist Nora Ayanian and environmental engineering scholar Kelly Sanders were named in the 16th annual review for leadership in their respective fields, according to USC News.
Ayanian’s research focuses on multi-robot coordination and finding real-life applications for those systems. Ayanian aims to eliminate poor coordination between robots working in a team.
Sanders, a sustainability expert, studies ways to enhance the relationship between energy and water, focusing on ways to provide safe and reliable water and energy supplies without using too much of either.
Those honored are placed in one of five categories: Inventors, Entrepreneurs, Visionaries, Humanitarians and Pioneers. Ayanian was named as a Visionary, while Sanders was listed under Humanitarian. Ayanian and Sanders are the 12th and 13th USC faculty members to be featured in the list. Eleven other Trojans have been featured since 2009.
“It is gratifying that the remarkable talent and promise of Nora Ayanian and Kelly Sanders were aptly recognized by MIT Technology Review,” Viterbi Dean Yannis C. Yortsos said in an interview with USC News. “Together with the other 11 USC Viterbi recognized in this list in the last seven years, they represent the new face of engineering — talented, innovative, charismatic, diverse and immensely promising. We could not be more proud of their achievements.”
Ayanian received the 2016 Okawa Foundation Research Grant in July, and won the National Science Foundation’s CAREER Award in March. She taught an Introduction to Robotics Class at Viterbi in the spring semester as well. 
Sanders was recognized in Forbes’ 30 Under 30 feature in 2012, and was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow for three years prior. Her Sustainable Systems Research Group is a part of the Sonny Astani Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
Ayanian and Sanders, along with the other honorees, will be recognized at the annual EmTech MIT conference held in Massachusetts in October.

Jessica Zhou | Daily TrojanConstruction continues · The Element student housing complex, located at the corner of Hoover Street and Adams Boulevard, was meant to be completed this summer. However, it remains incomplete and students have been moved Downtown.
Just over a month before the first day of classes, students leasing apartments in the Element student housing complex north of campus were notified that they would not actually be able to move in at the beginning of this semester. 
Though initially scheduled to be completed and ready for move-in before the beginning of the fall semester, the Element complex has been riddled with delays that has left many students displaced. 
“It was extremely unsettling to hear that Element was not done with construction,” said Turner Wong, a senior majoring in international relations and east Asian languages who had signed a lease with the housing complex. “This is far from the ideal situation.” 
Located at the intersection of Hoover Street and Adams Boulevard, Element is designed to be a four-story structure, featuring 46 townhomes and 4,100 square feet of street-level commercial space.
But a stall in city approval and a string of construction delays has set off its opening until mid-September. With the holdup, a majority of the lessees have been relocated by the complex’s management company, StuHo, to the Da Vinci Apartments in Downtown Los Angeles.
StuHo has informed lessees that they hope to have students moved in by Sept. 15. In the meantime, the units for the displaced students at Da Vinci have been secured until Sept. 30. 
Some lessees, however, are doubtful of the ability to move in by that date. In the best case scenario, students would only be able to move into a half-complete project. 
“We signed a contract to live in Element; we did not sign up to live in the Da Vinci and a half-completed building,” Wong said.
Donald Annarella, a senior majoring in real estate development who was also displaced during the delay, said that even though he is looking forward to the completed apartments, the delay has proved difficult to accommodate. 
“I think it’s going to be a great development, but it’s inconvenient to have to shuttle around everywhere,” Annarella said.
Annarella did note a rent decrease for the majority of the fall semester, though his parents were still unhappy.
“They told me they would be discounting the rent by 20 percent from August through to December,” Annarella said. “My parents thought it was inconvenient, paying and signing the lease for a non-finished building.”
The Da Vinci has also fallen flat with many of the displaced residents. 
While Element advertised its proximity to campus, students at Da Vinci now must be shuttled to school, a service offered by Da Vinci management. Due to traffic jams downtown, some have found the need to Uber instead.
Also, some say they have been given arrangements at Da Vinci that don’t match the layout that StuHo promised in Element, which advertised three-bedroom, three-bathroom floor plans with high-quality finishes. 
Wong said it’s evident that the Da Vinci was not built with student living in mind and thus is not a proper relocation. 
“The apartments at Element fit six people, however the rooms at the Da Vinci only fit four,” Wong said. “My roommate and I are separated from the four other girls in our house.” 
Element still advertises on the front page of its leasing website that it will be opening in August 2016. Furthermore, the lease term on its website still hasn’t been updated to reflect the current status of the delayed approvals.
StuHo was unable to be reached for a comment.

The School of Cinematic Arts achieved the number one ranking for film schools nationwide in The Hollywood Reporter’s annual list for the fourth year in a row. 
The publication cited USC’s innovative virtual reality incubator as one reason the University received the top spot.
USC recently partnered with Jaunt VR, a company that provides virtual reality cameras to immerse people in an all-encompassing viewing experience, to create the Jaunt Cinematic Virtual Reality Lab. The first stage of the lab will consist of a trial period to allow students and faculty to understand the program. Eventually, virtual reality classes will be offered once professors are familiar with the system.
“I think what makes us a compelling choice is our focus on the future,” said Elizabeth Daley, dean of the School of Cinematic Arts. “The Hollywood Reporter mentioned our efforts in virtual reality. We believe our students have the talent to conceive and create exciting VR content, and we want them to have the technology to explore and experiment.”
USC alum George Lucas’s $10 million donation to establish an endowment for minority scholarships further distinguishes SCA from other film schools, according to The Hollywood Reporter ranking. Each year, a group of minority students will be selected as George Lucas Scholars and receive financial assistance from the school. The goal of the scholarship fund is to help increase minority representation within the film industry, thus allowing more diverse perspectives to be showcased in theaters.
“Diversity … might seem like an issue that is removed from technology,” Daley said. “But it’s also incredibly important to our industry’s future because we cannot continue to grow without being inclusive.”
Daley also noted SCA’s prominent faculty, many of whom have won Academy Awards and have produced innovative works throughout their careers. Daley said that SCA’s mix of scholarly and professional faculty creates a more holistic experience for students.
USC’s location near the Hollywood studios and other film companies, as well as its extensive alumni network in the industry, also likely plays a role in its success.
“I think location matters a lot,” said Sadie Cibula, a freshman majoring in cinema and media studies. “A lot of people know USC. I went to a high school where a lot of my friends’ parents had been very successful in the entertainment industry after going to USC.”
As of 2015, USC SCA alumni have collectively won 82 Oscars with 289 nominations as well as 129 Emmy wins and 607 nominations. On Sept. 18, more SCA graduates have the chance to win an Emmy.
“We graduate students who are broadly educated in both the theory and practice of filmmaking,” Daley said. “They are not narrowly trained in one special area and so are able to move more quickly into their career. They know the history of the field, they know how to use the tools, and they have a vision for their own work.”

The Trojans began practice Tuesday at Howard Jones Field with their roles clearly established now that head coach Clay Helton released the depth chart for the start of the season. The next two weeks will be focused on the opener against Alabama.
The depth chart is highlighted by the announcement of Max Browne being named the starting quarterback. Browne was expected to win the job, but redshirt freshman Sam Darnold gave the coaches a reason to extend the competition into fall camp.
At the Helm
Though the nod to become the next starter was admittedly relieving, Browne’s role has shifted as well with the stress placed upon him.
“It’s just a different type of stress,” Browne said. “You’re able to relax and really hone in on something you need to work on during practice, but it’s different. Now we are preparing for week one which is exciting. It’s awesome. I wouldn’t say it’s relaxed.”
Browne also described how he is fit for leading the Trojans, regardless of what the season has in store.
“I’ve had my fair share of falling up short and battling back, which I think is a great life lesson that will serve us well this season,” Browne said. “It’s not going to go perfect, and the ability to respond and lead these guys is huge. I’ve been here almost four years now, I have a good relationship with all the guys on the team, which I think is crucial as far as leading these guys and getting them ready for week one.”
Carrying the Trojans to Victory
Another key position for the Trojan offense was crowned with a new starter. Senior tailback Justin Davis was named the starter over sophomore Ronald Jones II.
Many have praised Davis for his talent and potential, including former safety Su’a Cravens, who tweeted “Justin Davis is the most talented RB on the USC Roster. Don’t sleep on him.”
Davis beamed with joy when reflecting on Helton’s decision.
“It feels good. I have the backs behind me who keep pushing me,” Davis said. “That’s why I came to ’SC, because I know that we are going to have top-of-the-line running backs, and we are all going to be competing.”
Davis also praised the coaching staff for preparing the athletes to be the best they can be.
“I’m miles ahead of where I was in the spring because our coach Tommie Robinson preaches that we have to know the whole scheme. Any player on the field that affects your play, you have to learn it. Whether it’s the O-line blocking, the wide receivers, rotations of the safety — the little things that you wouldn’t think that a running back should pay attention to.”
Davis looks back on his tenure in a positive light, but is quick to understand his role in continuing the leadership of starting running backs.
“It really lets you know how fast time goes by,” Davis said. “The dudes in front of me, Silas Red, ‘Buck’ Allen, they showed me the way. Now I have to return the favor to these freshmen because they showed me how to work and get to the top. It’s a rite of passage, and I’m taking the role.”
The Trojans continue practice this week in preparation focused on Alabama, with a mock game on Saturday to end the week.

Covering a quarterback competition isn’t really that fun. Sure, it’s always interesting, even tense. It can be especially thought-provoking depending on how different the respective playing styles and assets are of the leading candidates. It’s the most important position in football, and therefore the most important personnel decision a coach has to make.
But at the end of the day, it still feels kind of weird.
Sports are all about loyalty and pride. My team’s better than your team; our fans are truer than your fans; this is finally our year; we’re going to win the national championship. Sorry UCLA, we still run this town. Hey Stanford, have you guys won a title yet this millennium?
When the competition becomes internal, though, it can leave fans conflicted. For the duration of summer camp, players’ challengers are wearing the same uniform and sleeping in the same dorms. Only one guy gets to be on the field at each position for the opening snap, and I don’t want to have to pick favorites.
I guess I would say I was in Max Browne’s camp from the start, but not because of any technical expertise. He’s a redshirt junior, now in his fourth year with the program. He’s patiently waited for his turn, and I hoped he would get it. No disrespect to redshirt freshman Sam Darnold, but I’m just especially sympathetic for upperclassmen rites to passage now that I’m a senior myself.
The announcement that Browne had won the job came with an exciting caveat, though. Darnold might still get his turn to run the offense sooner than we otherwise would have thought. This really could be the best case scenario for the Trojans, and not just because it satisfies my naïve, millennial everyone-gets-a-trophy sports hopes.
The differences between Browne and Darnold aren’t quite night and day, but they certainly bring unique skill sets to the table. Browne came to USC as arguably the most highly-touted pocket passer in his recruiting class. He didn’t maintain that same level of attention or prestige while serving as Kessler’s backup. A more impressive performance during spring ball could have won him the starting job much earlier; instead, he had to split first-team reps all summer. But nonetheless, he fits the mold of a USC pro-style offense signal caller.
Darnold on the other hand is a legitimate dual-threat QB. He’s both much more mobile and physically imposing than his elder counterpart—though listed as only five pounds heavier and one inch shorter than Browne. He brings much more upside to the table in terms of his versatility. He also came in as a very highly touted recruit, leaving some to wonder if it would be worth it over the long haul just to hand him the keys right away.
This was first-year head coach Clay Helton’s first big decision since deciding to turn off music during practice. Helton had to be thinking about the long term but primarily base the decision on who could give the team the best chance to win this season. Ultimately, he decided to put his faith in Browne’s leadership and experience.
It will be almost impossible to definitively say whether Helton makes the right decision based off of what we already know about the two, barring some sort of an inexplicable collapse by Browne under the pressure of the starting job leading to a demotion. We only have one anecdotal example in recent memory of USC quarterback competitions as the sample size for assessing the success of freshman USC quarterbacks.
When Matt Barkley was given the starting QB job as a freshman, it felt like an aggressive, forward-looking decision. Sure enough, the team struggled a bit during his first years. But by his third year, as a junior, he had developed into a truly exceptional quarterback around the country, leading the team to a 10-2 season despite a limited roster via NCAA sanctions. But it didn’t add up to the almost unlimited hype built up during his senior year. He came in on top of the Heisman watch list, the Trojans came into that 2012 season as the No. 1 team in the nation in the AP Poll. But the Trojans didn’t even finish ranked that year, Barkley was injured in a demoralizing loss to UCLA and the Trojans suffered one of their most embarrassing losses ever to Georgia Tech during the El Paso Bowl.
In hindsight, would Barkley have actually developed into a Heisman winner if the veteran Aaron Corp had been given the starting job back in 2009, and Barkley had a couple seasons to soak in the strategic aspects of the game from the sideline with a clipboard? Could the Trojans have been more competitive than 9-4 in 2009 if a veteran was under center? We will never know. All we can say is that it certainly wasn’t a surprising success, so the decision to give the job to Browne looks like a perfectly good move.
But as Helton hinted, Darnold could get the call for some short yard situations, either on third downs or in the red zone. It really would be the best of both worlds. Darnold would get a little game experience going forward for when he likely takes over but doesn’t have the pressure or expectations that he would if thrown into the starting role, Browne gets to really lead the team and run the offense and the offense can add some real versatility during some of the most important junctions of games.
It’s way too early to start making comparisons to the Chris Leak and Tim Tebow duo that won a national championship for Florida in 2006, but that’s what this naïve and nostalgic senior is hoping for this year.

To say baseball has taken former USC pitcher Andrew Triggs around the country would be an understatement. The 27-year-old career minor leaguer has played for teams in Idaho Falls, Kane County, Wilmington, Northwest Arkansas, Omaha, Bowie and Nashville — most Americans would be hardpressed to find half of these places on a map.
Even when he finally received his call-up to the big leagues earlier this season with the Oakland Athletics, Triggs was optioned — sent back and forth between the minors (Nashville) and the majors (Oakland) — eight times between April 25 and Aug. 5. His eight separate stints are believed to be the most in Oakland history in a single season — or, as Triggs calls it, a “dubious record.”
Speaking with the Daily Trojan following a start against the Baltimore Orioles two weeks ago at the Oakland Coliseum (he took the loss after allowing 3 earned runs in four innings), Triggs took his travel chaos in stride.
“It’s fun,” Triggs said. “You’re pitching for opportunities. I wouldn’t have it any other way. It beats the alternative of not being [in the majors]. I can’t be more thankful for [the A’s] organization so far, giving me the opportunity to pitch, to go out there and compete.”
Triggs was at USC from 2008-2012, redshirting his first year. USC dubbed him the “surprise of the team” his freshman season on his bio page, and he admitted he caught a few breaks that allowed him to shine.
He began his first year pitching out of the bullpen, but got a chance to start when the team played a rare four-game series against Winthrop. He toed the rubber in the final game. The following week, USC faced the rival Bruins at home and Triggs was fully expecting to return to the bullpen. But a starter went down with an injury, and the freshman was pressed into action against a conference foe in front of a big crowd.
“For me, it was like, ‘Woah, UCLA,’” Triggs said.
Triggs pitched seven scoreless innings that game as USC beat UCLA, and from there, he was one of the go-to starters at the top of the rotation. He was a Pac-10 Conference honorable mention his freshman season and entered the following year as the No. 1 starter.
He wound up being drafted in the 19th round in 2012 by the Kansas City Royals, beginning a five-year odyssey in the minor leagues, with all the perks of long road trips on buses and living in obscure towns. But Triggs enjoyed every second of it.
“I thought it was really fun,” Triggs said. “It’s a great way to see the country and visit places you might not have otherwise known and get to meet people you might not otherwise meet.”
He reverted back to a relief pitcher in the minor leagues, tallying just one start in his career. But he gradually worked his way up from rookie ball to the big leagues. After being claimed off waivers by the A’s in March, Triggs pitched 16 games in Triple-A Nashville before getting the call-up.
It isn’t too common to see a career minor leaguer of Triggs’ age make it onto a major league roster, but the 27-year-old kept believing he would.
“The biggest separator is the guys who make it to the big leagues know that they will,” he said. “Keep putting one foot in front of the other.”
Triggs said he still follows USC baseball and exchanges texts with head coach Dan Hubbs, who was a coach when Triggs was on the team. He credits USC for helping him make the adjustment to the big leagues as a starter. Injuries forced the A’s to scramble for starting pitchers earlier this season, and Triggs was called upon.
It hasn’t exactly been all balloons and streamers for Triggs in the majors so far. He is still looking for his first major league win and has a 4.38 ERA in 22 games pitched — four of them starts. His ERA though has decreased steadily by month — it is at 2.25 through six games in August — and his best start came on Monday against the Indians when he threw six scoreless innings.
Perhaps this means he won’t add on to that “dubious” record of being sent down to the minors another time this year. Perhaps he’s earned a spot on a major-league roster for good — or, at least, that’s the plan.
“Without getting too grandiose, the goal is to own the right to stay,” Triggs said. “You want to develop in a role where you’re pitching in more high-leverage situations. For me, it’s about that next outing — just get the first guy out and the next guy out and the third guy out. That’s the way I have to look at it right now.”
Clichés aside, Triggs is indeed taking it one step at a time.
“Sure, long term you want to earn the right to stay,” Triggs said. “You want to work into a role where you’re pitching meaningful innings and really close games and take it from there. Step one is getting the next guy out.”

It’s that time of year again -— when we return to classrooms, syllabi, assignments and beginnings as summer turns into fall and we have an entire new year of school to look forward to. For me, this new year rings a different tone, as I’m currently in the process of deciding whether to graduate a semester early or stay for the spring. My desire for a steady income dislocated from my parents and impatience to begin my career in earnest is close to winning out, but there’s something in the back of my mind that’s telling me to wait and bide my time.
For the past one and a half years, I’ve written this column dedicated to examining women’s changing roles within the film industry. How we’re being paid, where we’re getting jobs, who’s breaking out in the festival circuit and who’s had to wait seven years to get their sophomore effort off the ground. This column has been both emboldening and disheartening to write. There has been progress, no doubt, for new opportunities for women across the spectrum, but we’re in no way close to complete equality.
This summer we saw the unfortunate effects of a reboot gone awry in the all-female remake of Ghostbusters. Equality behind the camera aside (the movie was still directed and co-written by a man, though co-written by Katie Dippold), the announcement of the reboot initially felt exciting and encouraging, but backlash quickly formed on several fronts — naysayers disliked the idea of their favorite franchise going through a second round, and some people just plain didn’t enjoy the idea of women in roles formerly occupied by men. The Boston Herald stated recently that, “enraged fanboys … insisted that an all-female-led “Ghostbusters” was some kind of cinematic sacrilege.”
When the film finally premiered, the box office gross wasn’t what Sony (the film’s studio) or Hollywood expected, and the movie lost a reported $70 million, according to The Hollywood Reporter. What started as a seemingly positive turn from the studio system has now made way for accusations that women-led films don’t generate ticket sales — an opinion that may prevent other female-driven films from seeing the light of day.
However, George Clooney’s production company is currently underway with rebooting an all-female version of the 2001 remake of the film Ocean’s 11, renaming it Ocean’s Eight. Last year, when news of this remake first broke, I argued that maybe the female remake isn’t what audiences and Hollywood needed, but rather we should ask for whole new franchises for women altogether. Remaking a movie to include women in roles previously occupied by men feels a little bit as if actresses are only allowed the leftovers from their male colleagues, even if that feeling may be unintentional.
Of course, to simply ask for new franchises for women is definitely a simplified solution to an extremely complicated problem. Hollywood is having enough difficulty creating new entertainment in the wake of comic-book blockbusters without having diversity to worry about. And simply hiring women in front of the camera isn’t also the only thing we have to mull over, either. Warner Brothers recently released the names of the four male screenwriters hired to pen the feature. Even after they decided to re-write and hire more writers for the project, nowhere in there did they make the choice to bring a woman on board to write Wonder Woman’s movie.
And so as I attempt to envision the future and graduate early, part of me is a little afraid that the world isn’t ready for another woman to emerge in the industry right now. Since institutional sexism still abounds (Suicide Squad’s Harley Quinn as a most recent example of a less-than-liberated woman) and our reboots are not getting any better, part of me wants to wait until Hollywood has gotten itself together and figured out that yes, female-led movies do make money, you just need to have more of them to prove it, and maybe more original roles to offer as well. When a male-led movie flops at the box-office, we don’t point fingers at the men and blame them. But the other part of me wants to take the problem into my own hands, not wait for the right moment to enter the job market. For now, I’ll keep you updated with this column every Tuesday, and don’t be afraid to write in with your own take on the problem.

With just two weeks until a face off with the No. 1 Alabama Crimson Tide, head coach Clay Helton announced the official depth chart for the 2016 season.
The biggest question mark for USC was answered as Helton named redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne the starter for 2016.
The decision to go with the experienced Browne over dual-threat redshirt freshman Sam Darnold was one of the toughest decisions in his coaching career, Helton said.
“At this point, we feel that it is in the best interest of our football team to lean on the veteran experience that Max Browne has,” Helton said.
And while Darnold may be utilized in special offensive packages, Helton will allow Browne to make mistakes from week-to-week.
Not only does this decision cement Browne as the starter for the entire season and next season as well (barring any poor play, injuries or a trip to the NFL), it also confirms predictions of a pass-happy offense under Browne.
Though Darnold could be brought in for a couple of option runs here or there, some say the majority of scoring will be through the air instead of on the ground.
As for the offense surrounding Browne, the Trojans will feature starting receivers junior JuJu Smith-Schuster, redshirt junior Steven Mitchell Jr. and senior Darreus Rodgers. On the line of scrimmage, redshirt senior tight end Taylor McNamara will join redshirt sophomores fullback Reuben Peters, left guard Chris Brown, redshirt seniors right tackle Zach Banner and left tackle Chad Wheeler, junior right guard Viane Talamaivao and junior center Toa Lobendahn.
And while most of the starters on offense have been solidified, the battles at left guard and slot receiver could continue into the beginning of the season between Brown and junior Damien Mama at guard and Mitchell and sophomore Deontay Burnett.
In the backfield, sophomore phenom Ronald Jones II will be playing behind senior veteran Justin Davis with sophomore Aca’Cedric Ware earning the third-string spot.
The defensive side of the ball features much more uncertainty, especially up front.
With new defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s innovative 5-2 defensive scheme, the Trojans have unanswered questions at the both defensive end positions with sophomores Noah Jefferson and Rasheem Green competing over the left end spot and redshirt sophomore Malik Dorton battling Green for the right side.
Green could fit in either spot if either Jefferson or Dorton injure themselves before the season opener.
Redshirt senior nose tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu will provide USC with experience and much-needed run-stopping prowess up front.
Looking at the second level, sophomore outside linebacker Porter Gustin, sophomore inside linebacker Cameron Smith, senior inside linebacker Michael Hutchings and junior outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu all earned starting positions and give the defense consistent play-making ability.
In the secondary, while cornerbacks junior Adoree’ Jackson and sophomore Iman Marshall and sophomore free safety Marvell Tell III are locks, redshirt junior Chris Hawkins and senior Leon McQuay III will compete further for the strong safety spot before facing Alabama in week one.
Surprisingly enough, freshman Jack Jones has a chance to earn second-string honors if he can outlast redshirt sophomore Ajene Harris.
On special teams, the Trojans place kicker will be redshirt junior Matt Boermeester, with the punter position still in limbo with redshirt sophomores Chris Tilbey and Reid Budrovich both impressing in camp.
Senior snapper Zach Smith and redshirt sophomore holder Wyatt Schmidt join returners Jackson, Jones and Mitchell Jr. as the last starters on special teams.
Overall, the Trojans’ most experienced players earned starting spots, with some freshmen such as Jones, defensive end Oluwole Betiku and wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. each hoping to see significant playing time.

Los Angeles launched the first bike-share system this summer, joining dozens of other major cities nationwide which have already adopted the system.
Bike share is a rental system intended for a short period of time that allows pass-holders and daily users to pick up and drop off a bike at any of its locations in Los Angeles. Users are able to take advantage of this rental system when traveling short distances across the city. According to the LA Metro website, riders can “get a bike from any Metro Bike wShare station, go for a ride, and give it back at any station. It’s easy —   just like riding a bike!”
By the end of its construction, Metro will install 65 bike-share stations across downtown Los Angeles, according to the Los Angeles Times. Metro has created an app available for Android and iPhone in addition to its online map to find the nearest bike station to you.
Renting a bike works similar to a bus pass. Users must have a Metro TAP card (which can be purchased online or by vending machine) pre-loaded with funds. The user scans their card, and their shared bike is released from the dock. The meter begins to run from the moment the bike is undocked and ends as it is returned to a station. Beginning Aug. 1, if the user wants to use this system for a one-time event, a rental can be purchased with a credit card at the station for $3.50.
Purchasing a pass with an annual fee of $40 reduces the original price from $3.50 to $1.75 per half-hour. But until Oct. 1, half-hour rides will be only $1.75.
“I frequently commute to Downtown,” said Los Angeles resident and USC staff member Camillia Shofani.  Instead of paying and waiting for an Uber driver, which I only used until now, I can ride a bike for a cheaper price and get exercise as I explore Los Angeles.”
Metro also offers a monthly flex pass, where users can pay a one-time fee of $20 and have unlimited rides for up to 30 minutes each. This pass is suggested for those who plan on renting a bike three or more times throughout the work week.
Austin Thompson, DTLA resident and annual pass holder, said he used to worry about finding parking spots in the Downtown area when driving to work. Now, Thompson finds a station near his home and drops it off just a block away from work”
By the end of this year, Metro will expand the system to Pasadena. Other areas such as East Los Angeles, Hollywood and Venice Beach are being considered for possible expansion after the successful expansion to Santa Monica Pier.

Everytable, the newest member in a line of diverse eateries near campus located on W. 23rd street, sells nutritious, delicious grab-and-go food with a social mission. The restaurant, which opened its first location in July, has the goal of making healthy food available and affordable to every community.
Each meal is priced according to neighborhood, benefiting families and parents in lower-income neighborhoods. The same Jamaican jerk chicken sold in this South Los Angeles location for $4.50 will be priced at roughly $8 in other, more affluent communities.
Everytable CEO and co-founder Sam Polk is also the founder of Groceryships, a non-profit created to “address food-related health problems in South L.A.” after feeling tired of working as a hedge fund trader on Wall Street.
Groceryships aims to equip families in South Los Angeles with fresh food for six months and hold workshops where they can learn cooking and shopping skills. Eventually, former volunteer and future co-founder David Foster helped grow the nonprofit into Everytable.
“This is the first of what we imagine to be 20 or 30 across L.A., and the second one in Downtown, which is a wealthier area, and is selling the food for $8 which is really affordable for those who are used to going to Tender Greens. But, it also allows us to be a profitable and scalable business.” Polk said.
Everytable is committed to hire from the local community and from organizations like Groceryships, and from the Right Way Foundation, a non-profit that supports foster kids aging out of the foster system.
“If you’re a foster kid, you’re 17. You’re living with your foster family, and right when you’re 18, you’re out of the system,” Polk said. “So, the Right Way Foundation supports them with education and jobs, and we are going to continue to hire from there to include kids who need a lot help and wouldn’t otherwise have access to these resources.”
The theme of the menu is aimed at celebrating the different cultures and ethnicities of Los Angeles. Some of the dishes include Vietnamese Chicken Salad, Puebla Chicken Tinga with Spicy Chicken in Chipotle Sauce and Pozole Rojo.
Polk plans to take Everytable to new heights and has a grand vision for the future — to end food deserts and to have an Everytable in every community in the country.
“We believe that every life is equally valuable, and we want to take the responsibility onto our shoulders and to take care of that in a way that’s both profitable and sustainable,” Polk said.

As of Aug. 22, over 140,000 homes have been damaged in the Louisiana floods this summer, especially in the Baton Rouge area. And yet, despite the rampant destruction and tragedy, there are those who reach out to those affected and offer their help, even from far away. From food drives to donations from distant family members, social media has made recovery from and awareness of disasters easier. However, social media might also have an additional unfortunate effect — it might allow people to easily become passive observers rather than active participants in recovery.
One must look no further than a search for “#batonrougeflood” on social media websites to see examples of community support and the beginnings of recovery. From free haircuts for flood victims to rescue efforts for lost and abandoned pets, social media networks present several images and videos of charitable activity. Yet, one may notice something striking about the images, videos and news reports. The organizations performing charitable or rescue work are largely those that are expected to do such work, like U.S. government agencies, the Red Cross, local emergency services and other charitable organizations.
The impressive human capital that social media can gather and direct with astounding efficiency does not seem to be as active in these cases as in other times of recent national anguish. Social media websites exploded in activity after the notorious police shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. Sterling’s name alone was referenced in over one million Twitter posts in the day following his death. Now, with thousands of people displaced and a similar number of homes damaged, a Twitter hashtag related to the Louisiana floods does not even appear in the 40 most popular at the time of this article’s writing. Clearly, the nationwide social media network is not coming to the assistance of the people of Baton Rouge and other affected areas of Louisiana the same way that it did when Alton Sterling was shot in that same city.
With that in mind, it may be that this is a particularly pronounced case of the bystander effect, the observable trend that individuals who observe tragedies from afar with the knowledge that somebody else is already taking action to help are much less likely to engage in similar charitable behavior. Anonymous bystanders, by their nature, have much less motivation to engage in helpful behavior.
However, it was clearly evident from the aforementioned police shooting examples that people from all backgrounds can join in solidarity to protest injustice served to singular individuals. The people who took the step at the time of the shootings to make a post of support for those affected by police brutality are likely no closer in relation to the individual victims than they are to the thousands of people displaced in Louisiana’s floods. Yet, the public outpouring of support was clearly greater in the former case.
This has not gone unnoticed by citizens of Louisiana. Baton Rouge resident Jerry Washington claimed that he hadn’t “seen one Black Panther boat or one Black Lives Matter boat. All I see is our own people from our own city saving us.” Keeping the bystander effect in mind, he is likely correct. These movements are not coalescing behind the community that they claimed to seek to serve just over a month ago.
There is ample evidence to support this point. The Facebook page for Black Lives Matter, for example, made only one post about the floods; it referred victims to an individual photographer who offered to take photos of those affected for free. Nowhere to be found was a fundraiser, a call to march for awareness, a community assistance project, or any other charitable work performed by the organization for displaced citizens. When it is taken into consideration that the population of Louisiana is nearly one-third black and that Baton Rouge in particular is over one-half black, it is deeply concerning that a movement dedicated to reaffirming the value of black lives is not making a concerted effort to help the very people it claims to represent and protect.
The bystander effect is a powerful phenomenon. It is also understandable; people generally do not seek additional responsibilities and duties, especially if they do not stand to gain from them. However, social media allows even remote observers from thousands of miles away to contribute to recovery from catastrophe with a few clicks. Even if the anonymous and detached observer does not have enough reason to contribute, it is certain that large and powerful social movements do when their communities and members are deeply affected by tragedy, even if it is natural in origin. Social movements of all sorts should use media to help their constituents. In the current state of affairs, two things are certain. Recovery for people whose lives and livelihoods have been ruined by natural disaster is going to be long and hard without the help of their fellow citizens, and people who scroll through social media can make a substantial difference by donating some time and effort to helping those very people.
I love your article!
I would like to point out that this ‘bystander effect’ is caused by the large Media. I am a member of the Pokemon for Progress group that likes to both play games and also help people in need. We used Facebook to organize and execute in around a week a statewide supply relief drive to help the flooded victims.
It turned into a massive event that went beyond our state, and we received huge help from businesses, people, and organizations like Knights of Columbus, where in one day alone we delivered over 3.2 TONS of aid to the Cajun Navy, another volunteer effort that has done more than the government run groups in saving lives and feeding people.
And I am still waiting on the information on yesterday on how much had been delivered.
When love and kindness is measured by the ton, then Social Media has really been a useful tool!
Now, if only the news media would actually take notice that a bunch of nerds could organize this, then they might begin to realize that even their refusals to help us get the word out on live media (“Too small” “Pokemon for Progress? Haha!” “We only promote official government appointed organizations” “Good luck with your little group.” Or mostly “…”-no reply) may have not been the best for the folks in need. North Louisiana’s news and radio was great and helped spread our voice, but the rest of Louisiana’s media and national media pretty much laughed at our attempts to get the word out.
It’s one heck of a story: Geeks for good!
If you’d like to know more about the amazing people that Social Media brought together through this effort, let me know! My name is Jessi Duffour, and I love to see people share hope, love, and smiles even in the darkest of times.

During both Provost Michael Quick’s tenure as well as the years characterizing USC’s dramatic climb to one of the top schools in the nation, USC has prided itself in actively recruiting students across all socioeconomic backgrounds and advertises its need-blind admissions approach to high school seniors throughout the world. “For every student who really wants a USC experience, we’re going to work to find a way for them to have that experience,” Quick told the Los Angeles Times on Sunday. 
However, once the rigorous admissions process is navigated, USC may not actually be able to offer all of its students the same experience. With the many extra costs that come with attending a prestigious institution, there will always be a financial gap between those who have the ability to pay to be a Trojan, and those who don’t.
Every college student has necessities and desires. Equipment such as laptops and textbooks can be expensive even when purchased refurbished or used.  There will always be extra costs associated with traveling, whether it be from an internship across town to heading home for the holidays. Fees add up between specific, expensive textbook editions, new student fees, exorbitant parking fees, lab equipment fees, lab fees and more. Even with the financial aid that USC is able to provide to low-income students, there will always be unavoidable costs that a stipend cannot completely cover. These necessities create a small gap between some students and others, but the large expense of many extracurriculars turns the gap into a gorge. 
Between Australia, Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East — opportunities to study abroad are definitely not few and far between at USC, where many students spend a semester or even a full year abroad. Most schools and majors at USC have numerous study abroad programs available during any semester, and many of these offer classes with transferable credit once students return to USC. Studying abroad can be an exciting way to spend a summer or to finish a language requirement, but it usually comes at a very high cost. While there are scholarships for study abroad opportunities, some of the programs aren’t available to students who don’t have the opportunity to pay out of pocket. As much as the USC experience may be fairly similar for all students, the chance to travel abroad is not something that’s afforded to everyone.
Moreover, basic social engagements can be costly in college. According to Newsweek, 20 percent of women and 25 percent of men at USC were involved in greek life in 2014. This may not seem like a large number, but the presence of the greek community and the benefits of membership it offers can put pressure on students to join, despite the large extra cost that it entails. Even if a student decides not to rush a sorority or fraternity, living in Los Angeles is expensive, and exploring the city can be very costly. Whether the university can do anything about the rising costs of living and working in Los Angeles is doubtful. 
That being said, USC does attempt to provide students with free programming such as Visions and Voices and the Cardinal and Gold events. The rising cost of tuition here does in fact include tickets to see some of the most acclaimed performing artists in Los Angeles, which is not an opportunity given to most college students. This year, the free events will include everyone from William Forsythe to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and many of them will take place on campus. The Cardinal and Gold events also provide students with exciting opportunities such as a night on the Santa Monica Pier and a trip to a Dodgers game. The events tend to fill quickly, making them not entirely accessible to all the students who may want to take advantage of them.
What makes a fulfilling college experience varies between individuals, and USC does its best to provide all students with a fulfilling experience. However, the harsh reality is that USC is an expensive institution in an expensive city where extra costs seem to accumulate faster than many people can keep up with, and that prohibits all students from having the same opportunities and experiences as other Trojans. Therefore, the idea and notion that USC can somehow provide all of its students with the best “USC experience” — regardless of income — is, unfortunately, one that has not yet manifested today. 
What is your point?  Everybody is supposed to get a great university experience and education, which they do. The law of Economics is just as powerful as the Law of Gravity.  There is only so much money available and making everything accessible and available whether free tuition, books, travel, events would swamp the resources available and is simply not economically sound or possible. Check out a good Economics intro class and you may find out more answers. 
Jenda,
Everybody? A university like USC cannot accept everybody. Even the least exclusive colleges in the US, perhaps of poor quality, still cannot accept everybody. And “supposed to get a great university experience?” Where is that requirement written? Some people lack the academic ability to attend college successfully; others lack the interest. Please explain that “everybody is supposed to.”
I am in complete agreement with you, there is no amount of resources (wealth) that can support “Free” education or healthcare …
I believe al of the Trojan Family already receive a great experience and education inside and outside the classroom.

A new semester means fresh notebooks, unused pens, and endless hours online shopping for dorm room accessories. However, the most underrated part of back-to-school shopping is the process of stocking up on snacks. The ones that will keep you motivated throughout the day and during your inevitable all-nighter. The ones for when there are not enough hours for breakfast or lunch. And the ones for when you just need to munch. These snacks must walk the fine line between healthy and delicious which, luckily, is not too hard to find these days. Here are my picks for this semester:
For Busy Mornings:

As the University continues to change, USC has taken an active role in forging new concepts and traditions for students. On Friday, the University’s incoming fall class attended the first annual Residential College Cup Ceremony and Rally at Hahn Plaza and the Galen Center.
Freshmen gathered at Hahn Plaza for a traditional Trojan welcome that included a performance by the USC marching band, the Spirit of Troy. Following the hour-long welcome, flag-bearers for each residential college led students from the Plaza to the Galen Center.
The ceremony opened with a message from Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, who encouraged students to take advantage of the Residential College Cup by participating in various campus activities throughout the year with their peers.
Afterwards, students engaged in various games and spirit competitions to earn points for their respective residential colleges. New North ended the night with a victory, as announced at the event, while West Residential College won the most points for spirit.
After launching the residential college model in 2012, USC Residential Education has taken major steps toward improving the social and cultural atmosphere of on-campus housing communities. To prepare for the opening of five additional colleges at USC Village, the department has worked to reintroduce the model among the six current residential colleges.
The Cup competition was conceived as a year-long endeavor for victory among students at New North, Birnkrant, South, West, Parkside Arts & Humanities and Parkside International Residential Colleges.
For some students, the establishment of the Cup represents strong efforts by the University to create a sense of community and belonging for new students in residential life.
“[The Residential College Cup] gives students something to be a part of right from the start. When preparing for college, one of my biggest worries was figuring out ways to get involved with my fellow students,” said Cameron Greely, a freshman majoring in film and television production. “With the cup, I already have a team and a goal to shoot for.”
Others were not as receptive to the idea of the competition and were disappointed by the logistical planning of the ceremony. Jenna Lin, a freshman studying arts, technology and the business of innovation, expressed her dissatisfaction with the event.
“The length of the event was slightly longer than I had anticipated,” Lin said. “It was very overwhelming for freshmen who had just recently moved in. There weren’t many breaks in between events, and despite the fact that there were a lot of different competitions, only a number of students were able to participate while the majority simply sat on the bleachers and observed.”
The Cup competition included a variety of events hosted throughout the year. Intramural leagues for residential colleges have been established for the academic year in a partnership with USC Recreational Sports, according to ResEd. In addition, the competition will also feature a variety of events such as quiz bowls, community service events and exclusive programming. Points will be kept and maintained by USC Residential Education, and the winner of the Residential College Cup will be announced by the end of the academic year.
