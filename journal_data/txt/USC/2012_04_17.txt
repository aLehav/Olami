The honorees include 12 decorated athletes in nine different sports who have made their mark in USC athletics, the professional realm and the Olympics.
Women’s tennis pioneer Hallquist was the first female player to receive an athletic scholarship from USC and went on to garner seven national collegiate championships.
Swimmer and water polo standout Hughes was the first American athlete to compete in two different sports in the same Olympics since 1926 at the 1956 Melbourne Games.
Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson held the USC and conference record for pass receptions in a season (since broken by Robert Woods) at 102 and earned MVP honors in the 1995 Cotton Bowl and 1996 Rose Bowl.
Lefty pitcher Randy Johnson won 16 games with USC, including a 5-0 finish in 1983. After his collegiate career, Johnson went on to capture five Cy Young awards in the MLB and MVP of the 2001 World Series.
Thompson led the Women of Troy to three NCAA tournament appearances and was the first player drafted to the WNBA. The nine-time All-Star has won four WNBA titles and is the all-time scoring leader in league history.
Watts, who took the NCAA 400-meter race in 1992, won two gold medals at the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992. He currently holds the Olympic record for the 400-meter at 43.50 seconds.
Other inductees include USC Trojan Marching Band director Bartner, sportswriter Bisheff, 18-year Trojan athletics administrator Hedges, ardent fan Hughes and the late Twogood, who coached USC men’s basketball to the Final Four in 1954.
The Hall of Famers are selected by a 75-member panel comprised of media, USC alumni and athletic department supporters.
Tickets for the induction dinner at the Galen Center can be obtained online at USCTrojans.com or by calling the USC Athletic Department.
It is so great to see these amazing athletes and others recognized. Hope we get a great turnout at Galen May 12th.
I know some of them personally and have watched many others..
Always Fight ON!!!

Death tends to put things in perspective, even when we don’t ask for it.
It teaches us that the big things aren’t so big and in times of need, it’s important to appreciate the small things that typically get overlooked.
Our campus community was dealt a cruel and unfair blow last Wednesday morning, when two of our own, Ying Wu and Ming Qu, were tragically murdered outside a home in the West Adams area.
Distraction · In a time of turmoil and despair around the USC campus, the spring game provided a brief getaway for all the fans in attendance. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Now, I didn’t know my two fallen peers. We never shared a class, a smile or even a parting glance. But what we did share was something far greater.
It was the bond of being a Trojan.
And as Trojans, we usually turn to football to find some much-needed soup for the soul.
After almost a week of collective mourning, the USC community did what it does best in the face of unwarranted circumstances: It began to pick up the pieces.
Though the annual scrimmage typically serves as an open exhibition for one and all to get a taste of what next year’s squad will look like, this year the stakes were much higher.
This year the game was worth much more. It was a rallying point for all who passed through the turnstiles.
Sure, Lane Kiffin’s coaching staff used the time wisely to evaluate what certainly looks like a top-five-caliber program entering next fall’s season, but to be perfectly honest, this inter-squad contest wasn’t about X’s and O’s, starters and backups, and winners or losers.
The scoreboard may have read as if the white team was victorious, but every member in attendance, from the players to the coaching staff to the stadium attendants, felt a sigh of relief at the game’s conclusion. For a few hours, football provided members of this community a chance to let go, a chance to get lost in something other than a DPS report or newspaper headline.
It was a candlelight vigil, a therapy session and a memorial service all in one, played out on a 100-yard field among the people who needed it most.
On this campus, the wounds of this latest tragedy are still fresh. Whether you knew the victims on a personal level or whether you read about them for the first time last week, they are and will continue to be a part of you, because they were Trojans.
Sports — in good times and in bad — reveal character. And Saturday was no exception.
It didn’t really matter if senior quarterback Matt Barkley connected with sophomore receiver Marqise Lee in the end zone, or whether sophomore runningback D.J. Morgan or senior runningback Curtis McNeal rushed for more than 100 yards. For one day, sport was not intended to delight but rather to alleviate.
The 2012 spring game should be remembered not for the stingy effort put out by the defensive unit, but by the strength in numbers put out by the Trojan community.
It was a celebration, for past and present, of what it means to belong to this close-knit university family. It was a celebration of life’s unyielding potential and even in the face of harrowing events, a celebration of slowly moving on.
No one can predict how long the grieving process will take, but if we learned anything from one another this weekend, it’s that as fans, as friends and as members of the Trojan Family, the process is not endured by one but by many.
Losing someone, whether it’s a classmate, a colleague or a loved one, teaches us that there is more to life than the outcome of a game of football, whether it’s played on a brisk Saturday in April or a warm Monday night in January.
But to all of us who have been touched by the power of sports, be it after Sept. 11, after a personal hardship or the hardship we all had to come to terms with this past week, death teaches us that the little things in life, like a spring football scrimmage, have a magical way of letting us know that it’s OK to continue fighting on.

For the second time in his young collegiate career, freshman Yannick Hanfmann earned Pac-12 Player of the Week honors for helping the USC men’s tennis team tally two more Pac-12 wins last weekend.
In No. 1 USC’s (25-0, 6-0) back-to-back victories against No. 11 Stanford and No. 12 California, Hanfmann posted two straight set singles wins and two doubles wins alongside sophomore Emilio Gomez.
Hanfmann, who is ranked No. 43 in the nation in singles, has been a force for the Trojans, who are undefeated this season and have won 45 consecutive matches since last February.
On Saturday, Hanfmann and Gomez started off the day with an 8-6 victory over Cal’s Gregory Bayane and Andrew Scholnick. Hanfmann then defeated Christoffer Konigsfeldt 7-5, 6-2 in singles to establish USC’s 3-0 lead over the Golden Bears.
The day before, Hanfmann and Gomez clinched the doubles point over Stanford with an 8-2 finish over John Morrissey and Robert Stineman.
Hanfmann then took on Stineman in singles play and emerged with USC’s first singles win of the day with a 6-2, 6-0 win, paving the way for the Trojans’ second sweep over Stanford this season.
In the spring dual match season, Hanfmann now stands at 19-3 in singles and 10-1 in doubles.
Earlier in the season, Hanfmann also paired up with senior Steve Johnson. Together, they hold a 10-2 record in doubles overall as the No. 7 duo in the nation.
Hanfmann last earned Pac-12 Player of the Week honors Feb. 20 after his 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over Ohio State’s Devin McCarthy, which secured the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Indoor Championships for the Trojans for the first time in 24 years.
The Trojans now have a total of seven Pac-12 Player of the Week selections this season. Seniors Daniel Nguyen and Steve Johnson and freshman Roberto Quiroz are one-time winners this season, while sophomore Ray Sarmiento also has two in the books.
USC will conclude the regular season with a home matchup against No. 6 UCLA (20-2, 6-0) on Friday at 3 p.m. and looks to finish with its second straight undefeated Pac-12 run.
It is a pleasure to watch these great Trojans compete. Do yourself a favor and watch these dudes get down
at Marks Stadium Friday. They are superbly coached by Peter Smith & staff. The Team is very close . The action is intimate and you really feel like part of the action when you watch.
Thanks guys & Keep Fighting ON to a 4th Natl. Championship…..btw, Yannick is a cool dude from Germany
who has taken to USC & ncaa tennis in a big way

After scoring a grand total of two runs during the team’s weekend series sweep at the hands of the Arizona State Sun Devils, USC needed a wake-up call before Tuesday’s matchup against Cal State Bakersfield.
As it turned out, the offense woke up in an 11-2 victory over the Roadrunners. The Trojans received a surplus of hard contact from the top of the lineup, with the top four hitters all tallying multi-hit nights.
Solid pitching · The Trojan pitching staff, anchored by freshman Stephen Tarpley, held Cal State Bakersfield to 15 runs in their four meetings this season. The Trojans now stand at 20-14 overall. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
The win snapped USC’s season-high four-game losing streak.
“We had a lot better at-bats [than during the weekend]” coach Frank Cruz said. “Our guys did a nice job of rebounding and turning things around at the plate.”
The win was the fourth over Bakersfield for the Trojans, who swept the Roadrunners at Dedeaux Field March 9-11.
“For whatever reason, we match up well,” Cruz said.
The rout was on from the very first inning. Sophomore second baseman James Roberts came up with a two-out, two-run single that gave the Trojans all the runs they would need against Bakersfield starter Spenser Messmore.
They added three more in the second inning, two courtesy of senior infielder Matt Foat’s two-out single and one more on a fielder’s choice. Foat finished with four hits and three RBI’s.
“All the guys at the top of the lineup had really nice nights,” Cruz said. “The offense definitely looked different out there. [Freshman infielder Dante] Flores was great for us out of the leadoff spot tonight.”
All told, USC got 11 of its 13 hits from Flores, , Sherrod, Foat and junior infielder Adam Landecker, the one through four hitters in the lineup.
Senior starting pitcher Brandon Garcia (3-3) returned to his regular Tuesday starter role but only pitched three innings, giving up a run on one hit and walking four before being replaced by freshman Nigel Nootbar.
“Brandon wasn’t throwing the ball particularly well so we turned it over to the bullpen,” Cruz said. “I know his control wasn’t totally there but we had confidence that our bullpen could hold the lead.”
Nootbar threw four innings in scoreless relief Tuesday.
“Nootbar was great tonight,” Cruz said. “After Brandon was out we needed to eat up some innings and that’s what [Nootbar] did.”
The Trojans now face a quick turnaround, playing host to UC Santa Barbara Wednesday at 6 p.m.
Cruz doesn’t expect the travel to have any negative repercussions when the Trojans take on the Gauchos at Dedeaux Field.
“The boys got some great rest before tonight so I don’t think it’ll be any problem,” Cruz said. “It’s also good that it’s not too long of a trip. I’m not worried about us not being up for the game.”
 
Nootbaar was charged with two earned runs in his four innings while Garcia did not give up a run.
Flores played center field in this game and left field in Arizona. Your article lacks any knowledge of
what really went on in this contest. Are you brain dead or just lazy to get the facts correct.
Regarding the supposed great pitching by ASU , the Trojans avg. in conference play is pretty dismal
with series against Utah, Stanford and Cal showing no productivity at bat.
In the 4th inning when Nootbaar came in, there was a runner on first which eventually scored. So this run was charged to Garcia.  Therefore, each pitcher should be charged with an earned run.
• Arizona State’s pitching staff is in the top 10 among Division I schools in four statistical categories: the Sun Devils have the third-lowest ERA in the country at 2.57, are fourth in walks allowed per nine innings (2.09), rank seventh in strikeout-to-walk ratio (3.23—242 strikeouts to 75 walks) and are ninth in hits allowed per nine innings (7.53). ASU righties Brady Rodgers and Trevor Williams lead the Pac-12 with ERAs of 1.12 and 1.41, respectively, and rank sixth and 17th in the country in that category.
hey coach, sometimes it is not that your hitters are bad or poorly performing, sometimes the pitchers are just good….. just saying!

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident summary on Monday, April 16.
Crimes against a person
At 6:05 p.m., a staff member reported that another staff member grabbed him by the shoulder during a dispute about an immobilization boot that had been placed on her vehicle at the Health Sciences Campus Parking Structure. The reporting staff member did not desire criminal prosecution of the matter but requested a report for documentation purposes.
Crimes against property
At 2:41 p.m., a suspect used unknown means to gain entry to a vehicle at the Gamma Phi Beta sorority and damaged an armrest while ransacking the interior but did not remove any property.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 11:09 p.m., DPS officers responded to a report of a non-USC male and a non-USC female involved in a dispute at 30th and Hoover streets and detained them for investigation. Both of the subjects stated that the altercation was verbal only and they admitted that they had been drinking. There were no visible injuries to either party and they were released after the officers warned them about their behavior.
At 11:47 a.m., DPS officers responded to a student who reported that he was experiencing the warning signs of an oncoming seizure at the Hoffman Hall of Business Administration. An LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #15 responded. The student did not have a seizure while being examined by the RA unit and he was released at the scene after declining transportation for medical treatment.
At 9:50 a.m., DPS officers responded to a report of a non-USC female trespassing at Starbucks, and when they asked her to leave the premises, she stated that she could not move because both of her legs were broken. The female additionally stated that the injuries were sustained in the past and did not occur on university property.
How did she get into Starbucks with broken legs?  
That Pike House drip is the best damn coffee and VD I have ever had!

The Coliseum Commission released Tuesday a proposed amended lease with USC, which would give the university operational control of the 88-year-old Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Sports Arena and adjacent parking lots over the next 42 years.
In return, USC would pay $1 million in annual rent for the management rights to the Coliseum, which has played host to the Trojans’ football team since 1923.
The school has been in negotiations with the commission since September in the hope of obtaining the master lease, which would give it the opportunity to manage the property. A terms sheet was released in January.
The amended lease, which runs through 2054, would be subject to a vote at the commission’s next meeting on May 2 or at a later date. It was originally enacted in 2008.
Under the provisions outlined in the 92-page document, USC would be responsible for funding various improvements and restorations in time for the stadium’s 100-year anniversary in 2021. Those costs are expected to total $70 million.
In recent years, the commission had trouble affording renovations, which are required under the original lease. Over the last 12 months it has lost roughly $1.4 million, according to financial statements obtained last week by the Los Angeles Times.
To fund some of the upgrades, USC would, as a result, have the option to sell the naming rights of the stadium.
The lease also includes a provision that would allow the temporary use of the Coliseum by an NFL team, should one relocate to Southern California.
Sorry folks. The reason to stop selling beer is a PAC-10 (PAC-12) decision. The Coliseum is the last venue to do that.
George,
It was USC’s decision to stop selling beer. USC agreed to pay more in rent to get sales stopped.
Does this now mean they will again sell beer at the Coliseum?
Enough with all the drinking and stupidity that comes with it during gameday.  Ive seen bloodied fights and other less then Trojan friendly incidents on campus during tailgaiting.  Enjoy the game with family and friends and stop being so amatuerish.

Average salaries for USC faculty greatly exceeded the median for full professors, associate professors, assistant professors and instructors at 1,251 colleges, according to data released by the Chronicle of Higher Education last week.
The average salary is $155,900 for full professors, $105,300 for associate professors, $93,300 for assistant professors and $66,600 for instructors, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.
Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Marty Levine said that because USC sets salaries on an individual basis, the aggregated data is not that informational.
“The sort of generalized data discussed in the story by the Chronicle of Higher Education is of limited use,” Levine said. “USC sets salaries individually on a merit basis within the constraint that the budget has to balance.”
Since many factors affect average salary, such as the number of faculty and the expansion or contraction of particular programs, Levine said comparing salary between different universities is difficult.
“Those percentages are just a generalization,” Levine said. “Different universities have different disciplines. Some disciplines pay more than others.”
Female faculty at USC, with the exception of instructors, are paid less than male faculty by about six to 11 percent depending on their professor level, according to the data. Levine said the difference between pay is not a result of discrimination, a claim that the university has studied internally with the help of outside consultants.
“Within any given school, we have no discrimination on the basis of gender,” Levine said.
Instead, Levine said the salary disparity is more complex and dependent on a variety of factors, including area of expertise and pay raises.
“That university-wide differential happens to be the luck of which disciplines men are in and which disciplines women are in, or whether the men are more senior and have had more opportunity to get pay raises,” Levine said.
W. Norton Grubb, a professor at the Berkeley Graduate School of Education, said that a salary difference between genders is typical at most institutions of higher education. Grubb, whose expertise is in education policy, organization, measurement and evaluation, said the discrepancy can be explained by pay levels in varying fields of study.
Grubb said some high-paying fields, such as those in science, technology, engineering and math, are weighted toward one particular gender.
“[There are] a lot of STEM areas where there is a preponderance of males,” he said.
Grubb said another explanation for the salary differences between male and female faculty is that in the ’60s there were fewer women in academic life.
The full professor salary has risen by an average of $56,200 since 2000. The change for the typical doctoral institution since 2000 is $36,400, according to the study.
Levine said one way USC attracts professors to the university is by offering competitive salaries.
“We know we offer competitive salaries because we hire competitively,” he said. “We are successful in hiring because we are attractive in many ways, but one of the ways is that we offer competitive salaries.”
Levine said the process for determining faculty salaries varies from department and school but typically involves an annual report from each faculty member, a merit committee within each school, a salary recommendation from the dean and approval from the provost.
“We care about our faculty a lot,” Levine said. “We want to have the best possible faculty. We want to pay faculty what they are worth, and we ask all schools every year to reflect upon their faculty salaries to make sure we are paying faculty the right amount.”
It also sucks that almost all the women’s sports teams at USC are coached by men.  What kind of a message does that send to young women athletes?  Is USC trying to tell them that men will always rule?  Is the sports director a sexist who won’t consider women as head coaches of women’s teams?  I’m not opposed to all male coaches of women’s teams.  Obviously the women’s soccer coach is phenomenal.  But I do think there is something very strange  going on overall in USC’s hiring practices for head coach positions with the women’s teams.
What about gay, transgender and bisexual professors?  Where do they fit in on the pay scale?

A memorial for Ming Qu and Ying Wu will be held at 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Shrine Auditorium, President C. L.  Max Nikias announced Tuesday.
Viterbi School of Engineering Dean Yannis Yortsos, Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni and Nikias are set to speak at the ceremony. Members from the Chinese Consulate General of Los Angeles and several students who were friends of Qu, 23, and Wu, 23, will also speak. A string quartet from the Thornton School of Music will provide a musical interlude.
“We are all deeply saddened by these students’ tragic deaths,” Nikias said in a statement. “This will be an opportunity to come together and pay tribute to their lives, as well as their many accomplishments.”
Wu and Qu were gunned down April 11 while sitting in Qu’s car outside of Wu’s residence on Raymond Avenue. Both of them were second-year international graduate students studying electrical engineering. Authorities have yet to arrest a suspect in the case. A $200,000 reward is being offered by USC and the City of Los Angeles for any information leading to an arrest and conviction in the double homicide.
The families of the victims arrived from China on Saturday and are expected to attend the memorial. Wu’s family traveled from the Hunan province of China and Qu’s traveled from the Jilin province.
Soni said the university wanted both families to travel to Los Angeles before he coordinated plans for the memorial.
The memorial is open to the public, doors open at 5:20 p.m. and parking will be available on campus and at the Shrine.

Since September, USC has been in negotiations with the Coliseum Commission in an effort to acquire operational control of the 88-year-old facility, which has housed the Trojan football team since the mid-1920s.
But the university has also been the only party afforded the chance to negotiate with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum’s nine-member governing body. And most of those negotiations have occurred behind closed doors.
Bid · U.S. Capital LLC, which has not been allowed to submit a formal bid for the master lease of the Coliseum, said it would invest more than $70 million into the facility and host events at the Coliseum 300 days per year. - Photo courtesy of U.S. Capital LLC
It’s an ongoing development that has irked some, in particular U.S. Capital LLC, a San Diego-based sports and entertainment company. Over the last three years, the firm has expressed a desire to obtain the master lease for the federal and state landmark, pledging to pour millions into the stadium as part of an effort to renovate the facility.
Linda Paul, U.S. Capital’s executive vice president, said it has not been given the opportunity to submit a proposal to the commission or to bid for management control.
“It’s almost being handed over to USC without any other competition or options at all,” Paul said. “That is our main issue. We are not even being responded to.”
Paul said she received a letter from David Israel, president of the Coliseum Commission, last year, which said the commission was not interested in negotiating with the company.
“No reasoning,” Paul said. “It’s just a one liner.”
Israel could not be reached for comment.
U.S. Capital hopes — if it were to be given day-to-day control — to spend millions, along with its private equity partners, to build an entirely new stadium.
Though USC is expected to spend roughly $70 million in renovations to the facility, Paul said U.S. Capital could spend much more, in addition to commercial hotels and other amenities in the surrounding area as part of an effort to refurbish the Coliseum and host events at least 300 days per year.
Under the proposed amended lease released by the commission Tuesday, USC would have the option to limit the number of public events to eight per year.
“This is a publicly owned facility,” Paul said. “It should request proposals for bids from other entities, such as ourselves, who can do a better job than an institution that is going to close the facility off primarily for USC events. We want USC events, but we want to open this up, so it can pop 365 days per year.”
In an effort, to explain its proposal, Paul, along with chief executive Leonard Bloom, has sent letters and information to Gov. Jerry Brown, senators, members of the Coliseum Commission and acting General Manager John Sandbrook contesting the lack of transparency.
Paul also said the negotiations are in violation of the Ralph M. Brown Act, enacted in 1953, giving the public the right to sit in on meetings from local legislative bodies.
“They’re making us look like the enemy and we’re not,” Paul said. “We actually want to build a new Coliseum with our money and with support from USC. Whatever they want built in the Coliseum, we’ll work with them.”
Los Angeles City Councilmember and Coliseum Commisioner Bernard Parks said the facility should remain public.
“It’s a public facility. It’s been a public facility for 80 years, and it should remain a public facility. I do not support that the Coliseum be turned into a private facility.”
And what about the concerns of the museums in the park that share the space? They have asked for limits on number of large scale (over 25k guests) events at the Coliseum because the parking situation could overwhelm their ability to meet the needs of the public that comes for the museums.

There’s a balance to be drawn here, and while you may think 8 of these open, free or low cost events is too low, these public events are not designated revenue generators in he first place. And no way could the coliseum grounds even handle 300+ large events per year without the museums raising objections among other concerns of traffic and wear and tear on the park. Plus, what type of events could possibly be revenue generators that many days in the year. All that is just unsubstantiated hype by US Capital.

Even of it was 200 events per year it sounds as though it will serve the public much better than what is being forced through now, illegally it appears.  Many would agree that this coliseum needs to have major upgrades and why would USC do that if they don’t really have to appease the public?  USC is in no financial position to upgrade even if they were forced to.  It is ridiculous that there were no other proposals even considered and that these were shady closed door meetings between USC and the commissioner.  I hope there is a public outcry for this as well as a full investigation. 
Bill, 
Your question is about why USC would agree to make improvements to their beloved home stadium? And you also questioned their financial ability to do do?  I’m guessing you haven’t really thought this through or you’re uninformed. USC has been wanting to make improvements for a long time now and offered to make 100 Million worth of them when they were negotiating the lease back in 2008. Fans want improvements and anyone else that’s been there wants them too. And USC has the resources and motivation to do so.
This little outfit called US Capital has severely limited qualifications to run and invest in the Coliseum. Have you seen their client / management list? It’s junior league stuff at best. They seem to be a shell of a company at best.
Looking forward to USC’s strong leadership at the new Memorial Coliseum!
East Coast Trojan,
USC has and should always remain a TENANT of the Coliseum.  The fact that the commissioners want to hand this publicly owned beautiful stadium over to them is completely underhanded and sleazy politics.  It appears as though US Capital has a knowledge and resources to make this virtually a new state of the art stadium with a broad vision of using the stadium to its fullest potential.  
I think it’s great that you have loyalty to USC but it appears that you share the administrators tunnel vision for the future of the Coliseum which is not in the public or USC’s students best interest.  USC of course will be reaping huge profits while paying the state a fraction of their earnings, all handed to them for free.  I hope US Capital stops this because USC in no way deserves to be given something the public already owns to be used in a manner that is demeaning to the illustrious Coliseum itself.  
Let’s leave this in the hands of professionals who know about sports and entertainment and will be focusing on not only the Coliseum but also the surrounding community for major improvements to their lives as well.  
USC wants to Limit the public events to 8!   In a public owned venue?  That makes absolutely no sense.  Operate this like a business and make some money for this state!
Bob,
Your critique is misguided. Are you aware that previously there were even less than 8 public events under the stewardship of the Commission?  The only ones I can think of were the July 4 celebration and maybe 1 or 2 more per year. “Public events” are not things like football games etc, they are generally community oriented gatherings.
Wow, so Bob is wrong for his concern that we are trading the commisioners for USC administrators?  I think his concern is needed by USC students as well as the community at large.  The point that some fail to grasp, or just try to divert, is that the Colliseum needs ownership by someone who will see it reach it’s fullest potential and USC is not the answer.  I don’t think Bob or anyone else needs your patronizing answer of the definition of “public events”.  The Trojans have 6 home games.  What about the other 359 days of the year.  Let the Trojans play in a new stadium which has been proposed and stop trying to obstruct the publics best interest!
300 events per year?
That’s equivalent to Staples Center.  I would doubt they could get 300 events per year, as an open-air stadium is much less apt for a lot of events than an arena.  Although, I think USC should target many events per year.

The City of Los Angeles is offering a $75,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the shooter of Ming Qu and Ying Wu, two Viterbi School of Engineering graduate students who were fatally shot April 11.
The city’s reward adds to the university’s $125,000 reward announced at a press conference Friday. The reward for information now totals to $200,000.
Search · L.A. City Council approved a $75,000 reward to be offered to anyone with information on the suspect from the April 11 shooting. - Otto Hsiao | Daily Trojan
Michael L. Jackson, vice president for student affairs, said he did not know about the additional reward money before the announcement.
“It is another indication of how committed and united the City of Los Angeles is in finding out who killed our students and bring them to justice,” Jackson said in a statement. “We are very grateful for the support of the City [Council.]”
Councilmember Bernard C. Parks introduced the reward motion to the City Council during Tuesday morning’s meeting.
Councilmember Jan Perry seconded the motion, and the 15-member council — 14 of whom were present — unanimously approved the reward.
“The second that [the shooting] happened, [Parks] wanted to immediately put out a reward for the slayings, and then USC came out with a reward, so LAPD asked us to put it on hold for a week,” said Brittney Marin, press deputy for Parks’ office. “Today was the first day that we were able to go through with our reward motion.”
The race and gender of the suspect are unknown. The possible suspect was last seen wearing dark clothes running southbound after shooting Qu and Wu in Qu’s double-parked car outside of Wu’s residence on the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue.
Anyone with information is encouraged to call the LAPD’s Criminal Gang Homicide Division at (213) 485-4341 or the Detective Information Desk at the 24-hour toll-free number 877-LAPD-24-7.

This time of year can be a rainy, awkward transitional period, one that comes months after winter holidays and months before the sunny, beach-filled days of summer. No distinct feature or holiday elicits universal happiness and celebration.
But for whatever reason, now is a popular time for cookbook releases.
A few weeks ago, this column made note of pizza guru Jim Lahey’s simply titled My Pizza. Now released, a look into the cookbook reveals just-ambitious-enough recipes that eliminate any need for delivery pizza.
To start, there are instructions on shaping the dough to achieve the ideal super-thin yet bubbly crust.
What follows are amplified versions of old pizza favorites. A charcuterie pie, Lahey’s version of a “meat lover’s” pizza pairs various types of sausage atop sauerkraut and creamy béchamel sauce. A honshimeji and guanciale pizza might frighten some with its name, but in reality is simply an umami-rich combination of mushrooms and bacon, here made from pork cheeks instead of belly.
The overlap between recipes — roasted squash and pumpkin seeds are featured in the salad and the pizza — is a smart way of pleasing all types of eaters and of suggesting additional ways to use leftover toppings, though Lahey doesn’t say so explicitly.
My Pizza doesn’t limit itself to the title dish, however, and includes sides that accompany the pies well. There’s a section for salads and for desserts too, such as an olive-olive oil cake that requires “fruity and not salty” black olives as well as a standard chocolate chip cookie recipe that blissfully calls for lots of chocolate chips.
Mark Bittman, “The Minimalist” of The New York Times’ dining section, has released the not-so-minimally titled How to Cook Everything: The Basics: All You Need to Make Great Food. This is not to be confused with his 2003 book How to Cook Everything: The Basics or his 1998 How to Cook Everything. This book is an update on both of those.
Yet you can’t help but hope for a bit more personality from a man who writes opinion columns for a living. And with a layout that’s sterile and calculated — ingredients are often shot merely as solitary components of a larger equation — nothing looks flavorful or inspiring.
As a sort of learn-to-cook encyclopedia, How to Cook nails that clear, informative style. This book really does teach you how to cook everything. It’s just a matter of how much of that everything one will feel motivated to make. For a beginner, though, How to Cook is nothing if not thorough.
Then there’s the more specific Preservation Kitchen, a cookbook from Chicago chef Paul Virant that focuses on pickling, canning and preserving.
“This isn’t a complicated menu, but it benefits from forethought,” Virant writes in a preface for a series of springtime recipes.
It’s a beautiful way of describing the book’s approach.
Salted-caramel ice cream with brandied figs can be time-consuming to make from scratch, but the recipe is considerate to home cooks and requires few ingredients.
Though the recipe breakdowns for jams, jellies and marmalades — ingredient, volume, ounce, grams, percent — is perhaps more information than necessary, it also signals an inclusive chef who’s eager to please with his first book. And in its best sections, Preservation Kitchen straddles the line between “I’ve always wanted to make that” (pickled vegetables) and “I wish I had thought of that first” (milk jam to stir into iced coffee).
The most anticipated cookbook of the season, however, is April Bloomfield’s A Girl and Her Pig. The cover alone, which flaunts an image of Bloomfield with a dead pig slung around her shoulders, has sparked considerable controversy.
But the illustrations inside are messy and adorable, like something out of a Roald Dahl book, and the photos highlight Bloomfield’s rustic yet refined sensibility. Best of all, she inspires detractors of British food — myself included — to give dishes like meat pies and bubble and squeak another shot.
And when that meat pie is a Beef-and-Bayley Hazen pie, depicted as a broken, golden crust with bits of meat and melted blue cheese flowing out, it’s hard to resist.
Unlike almost all others out this month, A Girl and Her Pig is not an “easy” book. Many recipes are fond of what Bloomfield calls the “not so nasty bits,” such as kidneys and sweetbreads. And toast with ramp butter and fried quail eggs isn’t the first thing you’ll be tempted to make each morning. But this is a special book, with recipes that reward effort, and Bloomfield’s funny, often touching childhood anecdotes alone make it worthy of a place on the bookshelf.
Of all the new releases, A Girl and Her Pig is the one that speaks the least to my diet but the most to my heart. It’s the one I most wish I had purchased.
Cookbooks, as useful as they can be, are best when they also lend insight into the ways and reasons we eat what we eat.
A Girl and Her Pig won’t speak to everyone — to each their own. Fortunately, there’s plenty of good texts to choose from this unofficial cookbook season.

This is a movie about love: the consuming fall, the crushing heartbreak and the crawl through the trenches of pain on the way to letting go.
Heartache · Sullivan (Sebastian Urzendowsky, left) and Camille (Lola Créton, right) must call their love quits in Goodbye First Love, a film that follows Camille’s intensely emotional journey to move on from her first love. - Photo courtesy of IFC Films
Mia Hansen-Løve’s newest film Goodbye First Love follows Camille, played by Lola Créton, a Parisian girl whose growth and maturation is seen through this all-too-familiar trajectory of love. As a young 15-year-old, Lola falls passionately in love with 18-year-old Sullivan (Sebastian Urzendowsky). Though Sullivan cares deeply for Camille, he “doesn’t want to become too dependent,” and decides to leave Camille in Paris as he journeys to South America.
Left alone, Camille gets sucked into a black hole of pity, anger and sadness from which she is incapable of removing herself. For the next eight years, Camille slowly begins to move on with her life, obtaining a job, attending architecture school and eventually finding love again with her professor, Lorenz (Magne-Håvard Brekke). But Camille never seems to be fully rid of Sullivan as she keeps a picture on her wall of her parents’ country home where the two of them spent a romantic few days before Sullivan’s departure.
Starkly different from her wild, emotional romance with Sullivan, the charming and soft-spoken Lorenz seems to fit her mature and grounded persona. Camille’s world is shaken up, however, by the reappearance of Sullivan. She gets sucked back into her love from eight years ago, realizing the powerful hold that her first love still has on her heart.
Hansen-Løve allows these pivotal emotions to show not only through the characters’ words, but more subtly through facial expressions, sound and scene construction.
This shines through in the way that Hansen-Løve portrays the inconsistencies between Camille’s and Sullivan’s feelings for each other. When in the countryside, Sullivan intends to go to the store but instead proceeds to swim in the giant lake, leaving Camille sitting outside, alone in the endless landscape, waiting. As she looks to the countryside, not a sound is heard apart from the scores of bees flying around Camille.
Hansen-Løve utilizes this technique consistently throughout the film, adding to Camille’s loneliness and emptiness. The expansive, beautiful French countryside, however, sometimes usurps the attention of the viewer, who is too busy focusing on the gorgeous flowers and lakes to pay full attention to the character.
The director also makes use of the style and setting to subtly express changes in the characters’ lives that, if explained, would merely slow down the tempo of the film. Whether it’s the drastic change in Camille’s hairstyle, her new apartment or her mother now living alone, these stylistic cues allow the audience to pick up and move with the characters, unencumbered by questions of why and how. For just as life changes, so too does the film, and the director has sufficient respect for the audience to treat them as knowledgeable viewers.
Hansen-Løve chooses not to follow the one girl, two guys cliché dilemma; rather, Goodbye First Love reflects on how people grow and move on from the heartbreak of losing a first love. Accordingly, she presents us with a girl unaware of her own lack of self-assurance, who cannot fathom life without Sullivan. Créton offers exactly what the audience looks for in a love-struck 15-year-old, hopelessly soaking up every moment with Sullivan and a second later shunning him in a jealous rage. She captures equally well the torment of being left behind, with long sighs and tears of anguish.
Camille’s spiral into a pit of darkness feels as trying to the viewer as it does to the young girl. Whether it is among a sea of people in a Parisian club or in her apartment glancing at the picture of her country house, her pain keeps her sequestered from the world.
Hansen-Løve familiarizes viewers with Camille’s journey of letting go so that they can relate Camille’s struggles to that of their own. She has no interest in creating a film that rushes through emotions, bringing a character down and back up again equally fast. Instead, Hansen-Løve makes the film resonate with her innate ability to broach such an important and powerful topic with equal amounts of tenderness, subtlety and grace.
After seeing Camille so distraught and closed off, it is difficult not to sigh with relief when she has her first, gentle kiss with Lorenz. On that note, Brekke, who previously worked with Hansen-Løve on Father of My Children, plays his part well and seems to have an acute understanding of the director’s approach; his calm demeanor forces nothing on the audience, leaving it up to them to discern his character. This isn’t to say that Brekke doesn’t put effort into the role, but he seems to understand that this film is about Camille and her journey.
Viewers interested in another sappy, Hollywood teen-romance should steer clear of Goodbye First Love. If, however, you can find beauty in the smallest moments, joy in poetic words, such as “I finally don’t feel burdened by pain,” and if you are willing to follow Camille on an emotionally charged journey — one that many viewers are all too familiar with — Goodbye First Love will not disappoint.

“Life is like jazz; it never resolves.”
This is the driving concept behind the film Blue Like Jazz, now playing in theaters.
The film, an interpretation of the autobiography of the same name, follows Donald Miller (Marshall Allman) on his journey from a Baptist-centric Texas town to the ultra-liberal Reed College in Portland, where he must confront new experiences and changes to the way he lives and sees the world.
Allman was seemingly the right choice for the role of Miller, as he actually grew up in a small Texas town. Though he was not raised in a religious, conservative home, he felt he could relate to the film.
“I know so many people who [grew up in a religious home] and by the time they got to college they left it behind. That’s what drew me to this movie,” Allman said.
Through the film, Miller encounters classmates, professors and a love interest (Claire Holt) that offer an alternative perspective on his faith and provide him with the opportunity to accept, reject or completely ignore his background.
“It’s an American story: a kid raised Christian and yet when he gets to college finds that his religious upbringing did not prepare him for life outside the church. How does it get more American than that? Unless, of course, there was a bald eagle in the film,” Allman said, jokingly musing to himself. “Which of course there is not — they’re very expensive and fraught with logistical problems.”
Co-writer and director Steve Taylor worked closely with the real-life Miller to bring the book to the big screen, which naturally required some changes.
“In the book, Don is a writer in his early ’30s; I felt like that wasn’t necessarily a movie story,” Taylor said. “It would be much more interesting if [the character] was a college student going through these experiences. Don understood that a memoir and a movie aren’t the same thing. They’re different art forms.”
Like Allman, Taylor felt drawn to the film from the first time he read the source material.
“I finished the book six years ago and immediately wanted it to be my next movie project. It was a take on a very common experience that many of us go through,” Taylor said. “Someone who grows up in a very specific religious community and goes to college and ends up lost in translation.”
Any existential crisis requires a catalyst, and in the film it’s Miller’s parents’ divorce, which was a result of their religious differences. Miller’s out-of-the-box non-religious father challenges him to question whether his beliefs are based on genuine faith or just his upbringing, saying that Miller “only believe[s] that stuff because [he’s] afraid to hang out with people who don’t.”
After taking the initiative to enroll his son in Reed, Don’s father sets him on the path toward self-discovery.
At its core, Blue Like Jazz is a coming-of-age story, set against the backdrop of a college student trying to figure out what life is all about. For college students especially, Blue Like Jazz captures the struggle of finding yourself without the security and guidance of your family.
There is also a love interest, here played by Holt, known for her role in The Vampire Diaries. Holt, often the soundboard of Miller’s insecurities, lends some balance to the film, as many of the characters play into college archetypes.
The film isn’t perfect — it does, at times, suffer from the familiar stereotypical trappings of coming-of-age tales. At one point in Blue Like Jazz, Don fully rejects his Baptist background and has, in his mind, the standard college experience: “got drunk, had a lesbian take me shopping and looked for an organization to take part in.” Though the scene is a weakness of the film, it’s at least entertaining and a revealing moment for Miller’s character.
The film’s production history is just as noteworthy a story as the plot. When private investors backed out, Miller posted on his blog that the film would be canceled. Two readers responded by starting “Save Blue Like Jazz” through Kickstarter, a fan-based fundraising website for creative projects.
“We were absolutely dead in the water,” Taylor said. “This was [a] lifeline that made the movie possible. It’s been one of the greatest experiences of my life. Honestly, it’s still hard to talk about without getting choked up about it.”
Taylor got deeply involved in the fundraising efforts. “I didn’t think this would work, but I said give us 10 bucks and I’ll call you personally,” he said. “I ended up with a call sheet of 3,500 names.”
“Save Blue Like Jazz” shows the number of fans of the original source material and the importance of the film’s message.
“Blue Like Jazz the book helped a lot of people know they weren’t alone for what they may have secretly been ashamed to voice out loud — that their faith experience wasn’t necessarily decorated with ribbons and bows,” Allman said. “We hope this film does the same for people.”

On Sunday, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa will reveal the details of a $16-million L.A. bike-share program.
You don’t need to look far from USC to see compelling reasons for such a program. To the east lies the 110 Freeway — and all the traffic congestion it brings. Bicycles offer a cleaner, healthier alternative.
Unfortunately, that alternative is a little unrealistic.
In theory, the bike-share program’s plan is great. It has successful predecessors in places like Denver, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Four thousand bikes will be connected to 400 rental kiosks throughout the city. Each bike will be registered under a credit card and monitored via GPS to prevent theft. On top of it all, the plan will cost the city nothing to implement: Bike Nation, a private company, will foot the $16-million bill in exchange for city endorsement.
Though there seems to be little downside to the program, it is far from a slam-dunk.
The distances between some of the planned kiosks in areas like Downtown, Westwood and Playa del Rey are much larger than the ones encountered by users of similar systems in Denver or San Francisco.
This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the exercise involved in cycling eight miles from Venice to Westwood is just the sort of thing the program wants to encourage. Still, pressing deadlines and equally pressing laziness could depress Bike Nation’s potential customer base in a city as spread out and busy as Los Angeles.
I’m not condemning the aim of this program. The danger it poses does not lie in what it does, but rather what it could detract from. It has the potential to distract officials and stall improvements on L.A.’s existing public transportation system.
The bike-share program should be nurtured, but realistically, it has a very solid ceiling. The city should continue to focus on expanding the Metro and continuing to streamline the bus system; it’s a much better way to combat our traffic issues.
 
Daniel Grzywacz is a sophomore majoring in neuroscience and anthropology. His column “72 Degrees and Shaking” runs Wednesdays.
I’m confused at why Daniel would shoot down a free bike sharing program, especially if he can think of only one reason it might not work. Also, the “it’s just too far” argument is exactly the attitude that people need to stop treating as fact in Los Angeles if we’re to mitigate our traffic and pollution problems.
Daniel should be supporting the program and advocating that it does not slow down the construction of a bigger public transit system. In fact, the combination of bike and metro is possibly the only viable one for Los Angeles in the near future. It’s true, this city is large, but you move 3 times faster on a bicycle than on foot, and you can take your bike on the metro. That’s what I do every day.

Rick Santorum’s decision to suspend his presidential campaign last week has positioned former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as the Republican presidential nominee for the 2012 election. And with recent polls showing Romney neck-and-neck with President Barack Obama, many citizens and legislators are beginning to consider the future of green-lit government projects.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Nowhere is this fear more tangible, or more relevant, than in the current California high-speed rail proposal, a gargantuan $70-billion project that would create a 520-mile line of electrified track from San Francisco to Los Angeles.
The project, which was approved Thursday after many years of opposition, would be an absolute financial disaster for California. If elected president, Romney should immediately withdraw all federal funding for this nonsensical project and encourage California legislators to shelve the idea altogether.
If current American railways are any indication of this line’s potential to succeed, the project should be stopped immediately. According to the Bureau of Transportation’s statistics, rail and mass transit receive considerably larger federal subsidies on a per passenger-mile basis than any other forms of transportation. In spite of all these subsidies, only 30 million Americans rode Amtrak last year.
In particular, the California high-speed rail project has been an absolute public embarrassment.
A few months ago, the price approximation swelled from a $30-billion proposal to a $98-billion proposal. After hasty revision, legislators were able to slice $30 billion off the price tag. The plan now stands at $68.4 billion — still $25 billion more than what voters approved four years ago — thanks to the implementation of a “blended system.” Under this system, high-speed trains would share tracks now used by commuter trains.
But the new proposal also removes stops in Sacramento, San Diego and Anaheim — three destinations that were heavily used to sell the project to voters in 2008.
The ballooning price tag is not the only part of the proposal that has come under fire. This project has been expedited through the use of imploded and biased numbers. In 2008, the Reason Foundation, a public policy think tank, published a report estimating that the rail would see only 24 to 30 million riders in 2030, far below the 65.5 to 96.5 million rider estimates that were touted by the California High Speed Rail Association. And these numbers came out before the project scrapped San Diego and Anaheim from the proposal. Officials are struggling to find a new way for the system to turn a profit.
Beyond the ample statistics that illustrate the futility of this project, we should look to common sense. Proponents of the project have argued that the railway will allow millions of L.A. residents to spend the day in San Francisco and vice-versa.
I question the lure of such an opportunity. What USC student would spend five hours of his or her Saturday traveling on a train to spend a few hours in San Francisco? Why would anyone pay a large fare to travel by train to either city when they could fly to that destination in under an hour for approximately the same price? I don’t think most Californians would even be willing to make the roundtrip flight. Sure, security is a hassle at airports, but similar measures could very well be implemented for this railway. And if a plane breaks down, you can almost always catch another flight. If the train breaks down, you don’t have a whole lot of options.
The Obama administration has already promised $3.3 billion toward initial construction of the railroad. The current business plan anticipates $20 billion or more in additional government funding over the next decade.
Fortunately, Republicans in Congress have been able to temporarily block future federal spending for the project.
The rise of the railroad in the 19th century propelled the American economy to incredible heights. But the Iron Horse has had its time and should remain in its own sector of history.
The decision to stop the California high-speed rail project is clear. At the very least, this project needs to go back to the drawing board before legislators proceed to saddle our state with even more debt.
 
Ryan Townsend is a freshman majoring in business administration. 
How does High Speed Rail score environmentally?
It is much more expensive in terms of initial cost than roads or low speed rail.
It consumes much more land than airplanes and airports.
It has a much higher carbon footprint than other modes of transportation once you consider the amount of steel, electricity and unused capacity of near empty cars.
Will environmentalists fight for or against high speed rail? I lived in Belgium for a few months before the construction of the TGV and many did not want high speed rail. Noise, property destruction, and cost are reasons to use tax payers money for essential infrastructure (water) instead of shiny, new, projects with limited usefulness (single mode, high cost travel).
Non-partisan CA Legislative Analyst Office (the financial watchdog for California bills, legislation, bonds, budget, etc.) says that HSR bonds/loans should not be taken out for HSR, even under the hastily patched together $68 billion estimate:
http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-bullet-funding-20120418,0,986515.story
Want to know who is the main, driving force behind this
boondoggle?  The entities that are driving Democratic politicians to keep
supporting a project that will not pencil out, will require hundreds of
billions to construct (due to mega project cost overruns) and require billions
in yearly operating subsidies because no one but business travelers will be
able to afford the high ticket prices – who are these entities behind
HSR?  Well, watch this video and public comment from the CA Sentate
Transportation Committee hearing on May 3, 2011 (where State Senator LaMalfa’s
state Senate Bill 22 to defund the CAHSRA and project was being discussed).  In the
OPPOSITION public comment to this bill you can see who speaks against LaMalfa:
1. California Labor Federation (union);
2. State Operating Engineers (union);
3. State Buildings and Construction Trades Council (union);
4. California State Federation of Laborers (union);
5. State Laborer’s Council (union);
6. Contractors/Vendors standing to make money off the project (i.e.
Siemens/Parson’s Brinkerhoff, etc.)  
The Unions support Democratic politicos, from Governor Brown, to Galgliani, etc.  There is also a
revolving door between former public sector Democratic politicos then going “in house” with fat “non-public” employment contracts that aren’t subject to a California Public Records Act Request (under Cal. Govt.
Code)  for review of those contract – so they need to make sure the boondoggle and BILLION DOLLAR  CONTRACTS are still being awarded when they leave office – it’s about the money, money, money –
that’s it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDEgullAF5w
Money for infrastructure seems a far more sensible expenditure than wars without end. We’d at least have something to show for it at the end of the day.
Ryan,  how do your numbers work out if fossil fuels are suddenly 2x the price they are today?  3x the price?  Mass transit in general is a huge plus as prices for fuel goes up.  The only reason it’s cheaper TODAY to fly or drive those distances is because the US Government (and especially the republicans within the US Government) have artificially kept fossil fuel prices low by subsidizing energy companies, and waging wars that spend many more billions than a train project would cost in fossil fuel rich countries.  Mass transit becomes practical when it’s financially relevant.  The reason that it’s so popular in those other countries (mentioned above) is that their fuel prices are not subsidized by government tax breaks and military power.
As an LA resident you’re perhaps not familiar with how wonderful both a subway and high speed rail system can be.  I would point you to heavily used subway systems in cities like Toronto Canada, or heavily used high speed rail systems in places like Japan and Europe for examples of working and efficient high speed and subway based train systems.  In many of those places a car is simply unnecessary – you can get everywhere youw ant to by train, bus, or subway.  Adding a station at a later date to places like San Diego would be a fraction of the cost of the whole train system going in.  There is no reason that if a city such as that wishes to join the system they could not at a later date.
I couldn’t agree more Ryan. Sure, HSR is great in concept and definitely has a future in CA in my opinion but you don’t move forward with a partial plan that is not cost-effective whatsoever, especially when the projected cost stands at ~80% of state revenue. It’s completely non-sensical that voters approved the project in the first place, then to tack on 25 more billion dollars for an incomplete construction. Are you kidding me? Last time I checked, embarking on colossal ill-planned projects are not the best way to close a multi-billion dollar deficit.
If high-speed rail (or rail traffic in general) is so bad, why are we basically the only industrialized nation left who has not adopted it?  HSR runs smoothly all over the world–England, France, Spain, China, Japan, even Uzbekistan all have high speed lines.  The US has the Acela line in the Northeast, yes, but why should it stop there?  Republicans and Democrats both agree that we need to cut our dependence on foreign oil; what better way to do this than to switch to a vastly more fuel-efficient form of travel?  Republicans and Democrats both use the national interstate highway system today and it was one of the most expensive public-works projects ever.
We need to invest in infrastructure and HSR is one of the best ways to do it.  Reducing dependence on gas-heavy transport systems like air-travel and automobiles can only help our country.  I, for one, believe that it is a national responsibility for Congress to continue funding HSR across the country, and a route from LA to SF would be a great place to start.
It must be depressing to be a Republican at such a young age.

The City of Los Angeles is offering a $75,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the shooter of Ming Qu and Ying Wu, two Viterbi School of Engineering graduate students fatally shot early Wednesday morning.
Councilmember Bernard C. Parks introduced the reward motion to the city council in this morning’s meeting. Councilmember Jan Perry seconded the motion, and the 15-member council — 14 of whom were present — unanimously approved the reward.
“The second that [the shooting] happened, [Parks] wanted to immediately put out a reward for the slayings, and then USC came out with a reward, so LAPD asked us to put it on hold for a week,” said Brittney Marin, press deputy for the Office of Bernard C. Parks. “Today was the first day that we were able to go through with our reward motion.”
The city’s reward adds to the university’s $125,000 reward announced at a press conference on Friday. The reward for information now totals to $200,000.
The race and gender of the suspect are unknown. The possible suspect was last seen wearing dark clothes running southbound on Raymond Avenue after shooting Qu and Wu in Qu’s car that was double parked outside of Wu’s residence on the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue.
Anyone with information is encouraged to call the LAPD’s Criminal Gang Homicide Division at (213) 485-4341 or the Detective Information Desk at the 24-hour toll-free number 877-LAPD-24-7.

Although USC’s club tennis team did not walk away as champion of the USTA National Tennis On-Campus Championships in Cary, N.C., it did reach a high point in the organization’s history in a satisfying finish to the 2012 season.
After placing first place in its pool, USC advanced two rounds in the Gold division bracket before narrowly falling 24-21 to the eventual champions Cal in the semifinals on Saturday.
With the title out of reach, USC then defeated Cal Poly 27-17 to take third place overall in the competition.
“That was kind of our punctuation mark for the season, and I think it was an exclamation mark to be honest,” senior Madeline Segura said. “We did better than we’ve ever done before.”
The team of ten USC students began the 64-team tournament in round robin play on Thursday against James Madison University, Northeastern University, and University of Missouri – Columbia.
After taking down the three teams to a combined score of 85-33, USC advanced to bracket play, where they defeated UC Davis 25-20 and South Florida 25-19 on Friday en route to their matchup with Cal.
“As soon as we got into bracket play, it was a fight every single match. We played really hard, and we proved ourselves as a really competitive team,” Segura said.
Last year, USC had to forfeit its invitation to the Nationals because several players had to pull out of the competition.
The matches, modeled after the World TeamTennis format, were decided by games won rather than sets won. The five sets of six games each were divided into men’s, women’s and mixed doubles and men’s and women’s singles.
Senior Jordan Rees and freshman Colin Tseng paired up in men’s doubles alongside seniors Ashley Ohira and Segura in women’s doubles. Tseng also joined graduate Amber Brightly in mixed doubles.
Senior Amanda Ellis and sophomore Dave Warren represented USC in singles in their respective genders. Sophomores Alden Mitchell and Yaron Steinfeld served as alternates for the team, while junior Allen Jebsen stood by as captain of the squad.
“We’re all extremely proud of each other. It’s as big of an indication as it can be in not going to the Nationals last year and placing third and losing to the eventual champions,” Jebsen said. “We’re going to go on to bigger and better things next year.”
USC’s club team is part of the USC Tennis Club, which offers competitive tennis to over 250 members of all talent levels. Segura, who is president of USC Tennis Club, appreciated the chance to compete after the team missed out last year.
“Four of us are seniors, and we didn’t get to go last year, so this was a great way for us to end our time at USC,” Segura said.
Despite falling short of its title aspirations, USC’s Club team already has its eyes set on next year and another shot at the crown.
“Although we’re pretty bummed we didn’t make it to the finals, we’re brimming with excitement about next year because we know exactly what we need to do,” Jebsen said.
