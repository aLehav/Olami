Before its renaming, most students had no idea that the USC Hotel was owned and operated by the University. While the name change is primarily a cosmetic fix for the auxiliary hotel operation, it serves an important purpose: raising awareness of USC’s involvement in the hospitality industry. 
In 2015 and 2017, USC’s hotel management team won multiple awards from the international Radisson group for its guest satisfaction and performance rates, illustrating its prowess as a successful, well-run venue. 
Beyond the hotel, USC Hospitality operates over 30 dining locations between the University Park and Health Sciences campuses and has over 900 staff members, making it one of the largest employers at the University. 
With such robust hospitality offerings, USC now has a unique opportunity to expand in a field it has explored little of. The University should build an innovative educational hospitality program integrated with USC Hospitality and the USC Hotel to give students business-minded tools for success. 
The Marshall School of Business currently has two meager offerings in the restaurant management field: a four-day Food Industry Executive seminar and a 15-week Food Industry Management program. Both are designed for individuals who already have food industry management experience. Marshall should expand these offerings to the hospitality field beyond food by creating a major program for undergraduates interested in hospitality management. Hotel administration and hospitality programs at colleges like Cal Poly Pomona and Cornell University have proven largely successful and attract hundreds of undergraduate students yearly. 
By following suit, USC could attract more prospective students interested in the hospitality industry and make a name for itself as a leader in hospitality education in the greater Los Angeles area. Currently, only two Southern California schools — Cal Poly and San Diego State University — rank in College Factual’s top 50 hospitality programs nationwide. 
While both Cornell and Cal Poly have separate schools for their hospitality programs, USC’s Marshall School of Business provides a formidable foundation on which to build a new management program. Many of Marshall’s existing courses and core skills could conceivably apply to a hospitality program; for example, the business administration courses “Operations Management” and “Strategic Management” provide general business management skills that translate easily to the hospitality industry. 
And by working with USC Hospitality, Marshall could establish the framework for a successful program without having to hire many new professors or administrators. 
Furthermore, USC’s location makes it especially suitable for a hotel management program. L.A. is a travel, entertainment and business hub. Each year, the city sees over 45 million tourists in addition to the countless others who visit for business purposes. Tourism drives both L.A.’s food service and hotel management industries. 
USC has highly acclaimed programs in film and media, which thrive off their relationships with the city’s well-established media industry. A hospitality program at USC could — and should — do the same. 
USC Hospitality and the USC Hotel would also provide a training ground for students to gain hands-on experience in the field. The Daily Trojan reported earlier this week that the hotel may hire students interested in the hospitality industry, according to USC Hotel Executive Director Dirk De Jong. With an educational program dedicated to the industry, students could not only learn, but put their skills into practice. The valuable experience they’d gain through USC Hospitality would make these students highly desirable candidates for L.A.’s hospitality industry and beyond. 
A university does best when it uses its resources both to educate and provide a service — most research programs reveal innovative findings about the world around us, but also serve as teaching opportunities for students who work on that research. To do so, USC should create a hospitality management program that would push the University forward in a new direction.

President Donald Trump’s fear-mongering and hateful rhetoric against undocumented immigrants have dominated headlines since the start of his presidency. Undocumented students have faced policy change and other threats to their residency. Universities like USC need to provide better support for students and other community members affected by the administration’s actions. Currently, The University lacks resources for students to ensure they know their rights around Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and their presence on college campuses.
While  several USC schools and campus cultural centers have resources and scholarships for students protected under the California Dream Act, the threat of ICE agents arresting undocumented individuals is increasingly pressing under the Trump administration.
ICE agents have little power on college campuses, but they can often take advantage of students who don’t know their own rights. ICE agents can enter public or private colleges’ public areas, such as parking lots, waiting rooms and dining halls, without prior notice, but they do not have the legal authority to stop, question or arrest anyone in such spaces. The only instance where ICE agents would have this authority is if they have a warrant signed by a judge. 
Additionally, ICE agents do not have the legal authority to enter private spaces, like classrooms and offices, unless they have a valid warrant. There is no legal obligation for students to provide any information about themselves to one of these agents. ICE agents also have no legal authority to bombard students with questions or threats. 
However, if a student voluntarily discloses that they are undocumented, ICE agents have the right to apprehend the individual regardless of whether or not they are on campus. For the most part, students are unaware of these rules and could easily slip up and put themselves in danger. Now more than ever, the University has a responsibility to help students prepare a course of action if confronted by ICE. 
ICE agents often come to college campuses to present at career fairs and other recruitment events without the intent of detaining anyone. However, USC and other universities should shy away from inviting ICE to such events because they can cause anxiety and distress for undocumented students.
Fullerton College, a community collegeless than an hour away from USC, is a prime example of how universities should approach dealing with ICE. The school not only provides resources to students to ensure they know their rights when dealing with ICE agents, but also trains campus employees on how they should deal with ICE agents on campus. This allows students to be surrounded by advocates for their rights, easing any anxieties that come with being undocumented.
More educational institutions including USC should adopt training procedures similar to that of Fullerton College to protect undocumented students and their rights. The current polarizing and nationalist political climate is disheartening beyond belief, but there is hope in the people dedicating their work to protect undocumented students who are simply searching for safety.

Going pro· Former Texas Tech head coach Kliff Kingsbury was briefly hired as a USC offensive coordinator. (Photo from Bleacher Report/Twitter)
USC offensive coordinator  and quarterbacks coach Kliff Kingsbury is leaving the team to take the head coach position with the Arizona Cardinals, according to Fox Sports. Kingsbury, who was hired on Dec. 5, will depart without coaching a single game for the Trojans.
Kingsbury replaced Tee Martin as offensive coordinator 10 days after being fired from his position as head coach at Texas Tech, Kingsbury’s alma mater. The 39-year-old coach accepted the position at USC despite reports of significant interest from NFL teams.
However, in the last week, Kingsbury’s future with the program was subjected to serious doubt. Reports that NFL teams wanted to interview Kingsbury for their head coaching positions resurfaced, but Athletic Director Lynn Swann blocked the Cardinals and New York Jets from interviewing Kingsbury, ESPN reported. 
NBC’s Pro Football Talk reported Saturday that Kingsbury could use the small buyout in his contract to leave the program and be free to interview with NFL teams. However, Swann then modified his stance and allowed NFL teams to talk to Kingsbury.
Kingsbury interviewed with the Jets on Monday, according to The Athletic. NFL Network subsequently reported that Kingsbury was being interviewed by the Cardinals Tuesday morning — hours later, Kingsbury made the jump to the NFL, leaving USC’s offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach positions vacant once more.
Although Kingsbury’s Red Raider teams struggled on the defensive end, he was widely pegged as the perfect candidate to improve a Trojan offense that underachieved in 2018. His sudden departure might be hard to fathom in the moment, but Swann and Helton will need to resume their search for a new talented offensive mind.
Utah State offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach David Yost is a potential candidate. The Aggies rode a prolific offense to a 10-2 record in 2018, as their 47.5 points per game ranked second in the nation. At USC, Yost would fill the same role as at Utah State while making an upward move to one of the blue-blood football programs in the country. 
Fans may question Yost’s accomplishments because they came at the expense of non-Power 5 opponents, but Utah State was competitive in matchups with ranked teams Michigan State and Boise State. In addition, the performance of Aggies sophomore quarterback Jordan Love would be encouraging for USC fans looking for growth from freshman signal-caller JT Daniels.
Fresno State offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Kalen DeBoer is another possible solution because of his ability to improve struggling offenses. When DeBoer took over at Eastern Michigan in 2014, the Eagles ranked No. 124 in total offense. By DeBoer’s final season in 2016, the Eagles ranked No. 35. Similarly, Fresno State ranked No. 127 in offensive efficiency in 2016, the year before DeBoer arrived, but it finished last season at No. 35.

“St. Elsewhere” actor Ed Begley discussed environmental activism and green living with professor Mary Murphy’s “Entertainment, Business and Media in Today’s Society” course. (Krystal Gallegos/Daily Trojan)
In the basement of Wallis Annenberg Hall Monday night, longtime actor and environmental activist Ed Begley Jr. sat down with professor Mary Murphy’s “Entertainment, Business and Media in Today’s Society” class to discuss his career, activism and eco-friendly lifestyle with students and guests. Begley is best known for his role as Dr. Victor Ehrlich in NBC’s “St. Elsewhere.” 
Begley kicked off the conversation by delving into the origins of his interest in energy conservation, which he attributed to his father’s frugal habits growing up in Sherman Oaks. He described his father, Ed Begley Sr., as a survivor of the Great Depression. Because of this, Begley Sr. instilled money and energy-saving habits in his son early on.
“[We] simply turned off the lights, turned off the water, saved string, saved tinfoil — all this environmental stuff that I’m known for, I got from him,” Begley said. “The most important thing he did was urge me to actually do something, not just talk about it.”
According to Begley, this conservation-minded upbringing mixed with growing up in smoggy Los Angeles compounded for an environmental consciousness that carried on through his adulthood. Begley said that he owned one of the first electric cars, which he bought when it was first released in 1970.
Begley said that he believes dramatic adaptations illustrating the environment could inspire others to take action, but only if executed correctly. He said that movies and shows where the environment plays an important background role, rather than the driving narrative, could easily influence others to minimize their own carbon footprints. As evidence, he cited when Henry Winkler’s character in “Happy Days,” best known as “Fonzie,” registered for a library card in one episode and caused  thousands of Americans to register for library cards in the following weeks. 
He also touched on moments from his short-lived HGTV and Planet Green reality show, “Living with Ed,” where cameras documented the eco-friendly lifestyle that he and his wife maintain. He said that despite its short run, he still has people walk up to him in public and reveal that the show inspired them to purchase rain barrels, solar ovens and other eco-friendly hardware. 
“All of a sudden, all of these people were doing these things because of our show,” Begley said.
Murphy also poked fun at a particularly memorable scene from the show, where Begley timed his wife’s shower to ensure she didn’t use too much water, which Begley happily assured was a one-time occurance.
“Full disclosure: I only did it once when the cameras were rolling,” Begley said with a laugh.
He also emphasized the importance of celebrities using their platform to promote climate science. For this, he compared climate scientists warning people about the impending effects of climate change to a fire marshal alerting people about a growing fire. 
“If the fire marshal tells you there’s a fire in the basement, you can’t just go out and do your song and dance — can you?” Begley said. “You have to relay the message to the people.” 
To conclude his talk, Begley left the audience with a single mission: fight fake news — especially when it comes to climate science.
“If you see something specious on the internet, go to a third party and verify it,” Begley said. “I do — if only we could get everyone else to.”

Kageyama Shigeo, or “Mob,” is a middle-school boy who struggles to control his psychic powers. (Photo from IMDb)
The second season of anime show “Mob Psycho 100” premiered Saturday in select cinemas across the country, reminding viewers why protagonist Mob, or Shigeo Kageyama, grounds the otherwise whacky and fast-paced show with a bleeding heart and unadulterated desire to be kind to others.
The episode opens with Mob exorcising an evil spirit that’s taken possession of a farmer’s field, manipulating dead vines to ensnare and suffocate its opponents. “Mob Psycho” fights are usually characterized by bright colors and erratic but beautiful animation. Yet, for however smooth this fight looked, the setting and use of dead plants make it less visually appealing. Although it sets the tone for the rest of the season, the fight scene falls flat compared to some of the early fights in season one. 
What the episode lacks in its first fight, it makes up for with other noteworthy visuals throughout. When Mob’s master, the con-man Reigen Arataka, tries to grow cherry tomatoes, only for them to taste awful, the animation switches into a style imitating 8-bit graphics. It’s a visual gag that invokes Pac-Man, complete with the sound effects of Mob powering up when the cherry tomato hits him. 
Another key visual moment is when Mob helps one of his classmates recover the pages of his torn up manuscript with his psychic powers. Moments when Mob shows his hand lean towards the surreal, with his power emanating in crystalline wafts from his body to retrieve the pieces from the wind and arrange them back in order.
What works best in this episode is the plot. Mob is convinced to run for student council president to impress his childhood sweetheart and fails miserably. He attracts the attention of Emi, who confesses her love to him because he did something out of his comfort zone. Seeing the lengths Mob goes to to ensure Emi is content — and how happy having her in his life makes him — is an adorable change of pace after dealing with evil spirits or pompous psychics. Nevertheless, Mob is still not good with handling his words or emotions, and his romantic side is often awkward. There are things he says and does while courting Emi that should not work, but because he is so earnest, the audience can’t help but root for him anyway. 
Later on, it turns out Emi only asked him out on a dare from her friends. She admits to finding him weird and thinking herself pathetic for spending as much time with him as she did. But Mob isn’t crushed by this. He realizes he needs to be more open with his feelings and, in the episode’s climax, he puts that into practice by rescuing her manuscript piece by piece.
Like most characters initially repulsed by Mob, she is won over by his sincerity in the face of a cruel world. 
It’s moments like these that allow the show to shine. Mob is a supernaturally gifted preteen, but he wins people over because of his heart. Eventually he does use his powers to help Emi, but only after he tries to fix the situation like he thinks a normal student would. Emi knows that the other kids in their grade wouldn’t go that far for her.
 It’s because Mob is different and awkward (and at times cringeworthy) that he is capable of such pure kindness when other kids in the series are not. He doesn’t take cues from how the rest of society behaves, so he comes up with a set of personal values from his own conscience. Being a psychic does not make him special; his selfless love does.

ShakeAlertLA enforces greater safety precautions during earthquakes by sending “limited public notifications” to users seconds before the disaster. (Tucker Judkins/Daily Trojan)
Angelenos may now receive early warnings for earthquakes by using the ShakeAlertLA app, which launched Dec. 31, according to LA Curbed.
According to the California Geological Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey, California is ranked the second-most seismic state in the country. In its U.S. National Seismic Hazard Model update last year, the U.S. Geological Survey found that there is at least a 74 percent chance that California will experience earthquake damage in the next century. 
ShakeAlertLA notifies users seconds before an earthquake hits. Additionally, the app also records recent earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 3.0 and lists the proper protocol used to recover from an earthquake or prepare for one.
According to ShakeAlertLA’s website, the app plans to send “limited public notifications,” alerting communities about earthquakes with a magnitude of 5.0 or higher. These notifications will alert users in a similar fashion to Amber alerts.
The Annenberg Foundation, U.S. Geological Survey and AT&T collaborated to launch the app, with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti overseeing the development. 
Steven Goldfarb, fire safety and emergency planning specialist at USC, was involved in the beta testing — or the initial product testing — of the app. Goldfarb said that ShakeAlertLA will allow people to take quick, direct action to avoid injury and other potential damage.
“Trains can be slowed down, fire station doors can be automated to open and hazardous activities could be stopped before the shaking begins,” Goldfarb said. 
Marshall Rogers-Martinez, a doctoral student in geological sciences, recently served as a teaching assistant of a USC course on earthquakes. Rogers-Martinez said that he has had previous experiences using the app in its beta form while visiting the Southern California Earthquakes Center.
When he first tested the beta form, he found that the app alerts users when an inputted location undergoes a P wave — the first set of seismic energy to hit a location. 
“I’ve been in the SCEC office during a Shake Alert, and it was really cool,”  Rogers-Martinez said. “[The alert] showed an animation of the P wave emanating from the source overlaid on a regional map.” 
He said the app has the potential to make a difference, especially in local communities where buildings may be more susceptible to earthquake-induced damages.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the city is home to 13,500 soft story buildings that could be susceptible to strong shaking during an earthquake. There are also approximately 1,000 inadequately reinforced concrete buildings that could face similar issues during an earthquake.
“I think it’s really great that Angelenos will finally have access to an earthquake early warning system,” Rogers-Martinez said. “It has the potential to save lives.” 
However, the app does have some limitations it has yet to address. As with any notification, users will not receive alerts if their phones are off during the earthquake. The proximity of an earthquake may also cause further limitations, SCEC Associate Director Mark Benthien said.
“If you’re very close [to the earthquake], you may feel it before you get the alert,” Benthien said.

The Center for the Political Future selects a Democratic and Republican fellow to promote bipartisanship. (Josh Dunst/Daily Trojan)
The Center for the Political Future selected Bernie Sanders’ former press secretary Symone Sanders and Mike Madrid, a principal at a California-based campaign management and lobbying firm, as the Spring 2019 fellows to teach courses about current political issues and share career advice this semester. 
Sanders will teach a course on the future of the Democratic Party, while Madrid will focus on how demographic changes in race, class and partisanship are affecting American politics. 
Sanders said she plans to teach students about the basic makeup of the Democratic Party, so they can analyze how the party is affected by changing demographics and millennial voter trends throughout the upcoming presidential primary and future elections.
“Even if they’re not going into politics as a career, these folks will be voters,” Sanders said. “I think a more informed electorate that can better analyze both of the political parties and think more critically about what it means to participate in civic engagement [goes toward] a better electorate.”
As an undergraduate, Madrid said he had the opportunity to study Latino voter trends, which led him to pursue a career in politics in California. He said he hopes to teach students about how California has previously handled and continues to adapt to demographic changes. 
“I recognize that we’re just in the [instruction point] now with the racial and demographic changes that are going to start happening nationally along with the economic divide, which is so prevalent in California but also nationally,” Madrid said. “There’s a lot that we can learn throughout the country that [lies in] what California has done and is going to do.” 
Madrid also plans to invite professionals to visit his classes to give career advice and network with students.
Outside of classes, the fellows will also host various events to interact with students from across the University. Robert Shrum, director of the Center for the Political Future, said weekly events like Politics and Pastries, roundtable discussions and office hours allow small groups of students to discuss political issues or ask for career advice from Sanders and Madrid.
“We wanted to do a number of different things that helped to advance the goal of promoting civil dialogue and having dialogue where we respect each other and we respect the truth,” Shrum said. “The fellows program focuses on students and how students can interact with fellows and what they can learn about the practical side of politics from people who have been at the center of politics in the country.” 
Gentry Collins, a Fall 2018 fellow who taught a class about the future of the Republican Party last semester, shed light on the unique opportunities presented in the course. 
Collins said that students took advantage of office hours and other out-of-class opportunities to discuss class material, currents events and professionalism with him. At some events, Collins and the Fall 2018 Democratic fellow Dan Schwerin discussed their views on issues and answered student questions. 
“I thought the interaction with the students was, without exception, remarkable,” Collins said. 
“The level of engagement, the quality of student, the respectfulness of the dialogue across party lines, and I think across ideological lines. Without exception, my experience with the students on campus was extraordinary, and the chance to be a small part of their time at USC was a real privilege for me.”
According to Sydney Lopes, a fellows coordinator at the Center for the Political Future, they aim to hire one Democratic and one Republican fellow each semester to promote bipartisan discussion of current issues. In future semesters, she said the Center hopes to host more fellows from various backgrounds, such as journalists, professionals from nonprofits and NGOs and international politicians.  
“We are a bipartisan political institute, so it is important to us that we are having different voices coming in for students to hear,” Lopes said. “It really shows you that even though you might see a lot of fighting on cable news and in the news in general, when you have two really respectful people sitting down discussing an issue, dialogue absolutely can be civil and you can have a productive conversation.”

While most of the changes have already been implemented, the hotel’s sign will not be updated for a few more months. (Tucker Judkins/Daily Trojan)
The hotel formerly known as the Radisson is ushering in the new year with a new name: the USC Hotel. The change went into effect Jan. 1, following the expiration of a 20-year-long contract between USC and the Radisson Hotel Group.
 USC purchased the Radisson Hotel from Pacific West Company in 2000 for $26 million, according to USC News. USC Auxiliary Services took over management of the hotel in 2010 and used areas of the hotel to house freshman until 2011. 
Kris Klinger, assistant vice president of USC Hospitality and the USC Hotel, said he hopes the change will clarify the brand of the hotel.
“Most folks didn’t understand or realize that we owned it or ran it,” Klinger said. “Taking the Radisson flag off of it and making it the USC Hotel — there’ll be that alignment … folks will understand that it’s the USC Hotel, not a Radisson.”
It has become increasingly common for campuses to purchase their own hotels, according to The New York Times. In 2016, the newspaper reported a growing trend of colleges using hotels to promote a stronger brand image. 
 According to Klinger, guests of the 240-room hotel will notice cosmetic differences, such as USC-themed pillows and runners in certain bedrooms, but most of the changes won’t be obvious to the general public.
 “There’s a lot more that needs to happen on the back end,” said Dirk De Jong, executive director of the USC Hotel. “All the various systems that are involved — the booking engines and online travel agencies … we’re not only serving the USC community, but everybody that wants to stay in this particular area.” 
De Jong estimated that the University spent nearly 18 months preparing for the change in order to ensure a smooth transition. As of  Jan. 2, guests can book rooms through the USC Hotel’s website, which is separate from the Radisson’s system.
In 2015 and 2017 it won the Radisson President’s Award, which “recognizes hotels that have consistently provided exceptional guest satisfaction, maintained excellent quality performance review scores and focused on product improvement,” according to the award description. It was also awarded the Radisson Renovation Award in 2014.
 De Jong said cutting ties with the Radisson brand will allow the hotel to improve in ways that were not previously possible. He cited specialized USC concierge services as one example. 
 “If we go above and beyond what [Radisson’s] standard is, we kind of make the other Radissons in the nation look bad because they don’t provide those services,” De Jong said.
 He also said the hotel may offer jobs to USC students, especially those interested in the hospitality industry.
Klinger said the transition won’t have an effect on hotel rates, but prices may still change.
“Every year, prices go up, cost of living … so that’ll impact what is charged to the guest in a small manner, but that’s affecting the hotel market in general,” Klinger said. 
Klinger said rates may also increase due to the recent hotel-worker protests in Southern California, which have demanded a $25 minimum wage. 
De Jong said nearly 60 percent of the hotel’s guests are affiliates of USC. While the USC Hotel will adopt a greater Trojan aesthetic, De Jong said he thinks guests not affiliated with the University will appreciate the school spirit.
“I think even those that don’t have a USC affiliation will still appreciate the fact that they are staying in a hotel right next to a major university because it gives them a sense of place,” he said. 
While almost all of the changes have been implemented, De Jong said the USC Hotel will not have an updated sign in front of the building for at least a few months.

Junior forward Nick Rakocevic shoots a layup against Long Beach State Nov. 28 at Galen Center. (Josh Dunst/Daily Trojan)
Junior forward Nick Rakocevic earned his first career Pac-12 Player of the Week honor for the week of Jan. 7 when the Trojans faced Cal and Stanford at home. This marks the first Pac-12 Player of the Week award for USC this season. 
Rakocevic was fundamental in the Trojans’ feat of starting conference play 2-0. In an 82-73 victory over Cal, he boasted a career-high 27 points and eight rebounds while shooting 85 percent from the field and leading the team in both points and rebounds. He had a similarly impressive showing in the 77-66 victory over Stanford, where he again led the team with 23 points and 10 rebounds. His 57 percent shooting from the field was enough to help fend off a late comeback from the Cardinal. 
He held combined averages of 25 points, a 69.7 field goal percentage and nine rebounds per game to secure his Pac-12 recognition. 
Throughout the last 15 games of the season, Rakocevic has averaged 15.7 points and 10.1 rebounds per game. As a sophomore, he averaged 8.1 points per game and 5.2 during his freshman season. 
USC will travel to Oregon to play Oregon State Thursday and Oregon Sunday.

Senior forward and captain Bennie Boatwright embraces his teammates before facing Long Beach State Nov. 28 at Galen Center. (Josh Dunst/Daily Trojan)
After successfully protecting home court against Cal and Stanford, the men’s basketball team will venture north for its first away game of conference play. Despite various injuries sustained by key players, head coach Andy Enfield has the Trojans sitting at 2-0 in Pac-12 play for the first time in his six-year tenure.
“We’ve just pushed together this whole preseason, out-of-conference and these last two games,” Enfield said. “We don’t know who’s going to be healthy on a game-to-game basis or even a half-to-half basis, so we’re very excited to be 2-0.”
Injuries have sidelined the highly touted freshman guard duo of Kevin Porter Jr. and Elijah Weaver, as the two have only appeared in the same game once all season. Nevertheless, the Trojan upperclassmen have been able to carry the weight early in conference play.
Redshirt junior point guard Derryck Thornton has been running the Trojan offense and setting the tone on defense for all but four of the 80 minutes of Pac-12 play thus far. He is currently the second best passer in the conference at 5.4 nightly assists.
A lot of those assists have been going to the skilled big man pairing of senior forward Bennie Boatwright and junior forward Nick Rakocevic. Altogether accounting for 91 of the 159 points scored in conference play, Boatwright and Rakocevic have combined for well over half the team’s scoring production and are proving to be an impressive one-two punch duo. 
“It’s very easy to play with a guy, [Boatwright], who is capable of doing so many different things,” Rakocevic said. 
Playing alongside a versatile player like Boatwright has created multiple high-low opportunities for Rakocevic, and the 6-foot-11 forward has been taking advantage of those good looks down low. After a week of career highs, Rakocevic was honored as the Pac-12 Player of the Week, making him the first Trojan to take home the honor this season. 
Seeing as Oregon State has lost just one true home game all season and is coming off an emotional 77-72 away victory over rival Oregon, the duo will have to come in full offensive force for the Trojans to notch their third straight victory in the Gill Coliseum. Another element that Enfield and Co. will have to strengthen is their recent defensive toughness. 
“[To win in the Pac-12] you have to make plays and defend,” Enfield said. 
Since giving up 102 points in an upset to a West Coast Conference Santa Clara team, the Trojans have held opponents to under 70 points in three of their last four games. 
The recent success of Enfield alternating between a high pressuring 2-3 zone defense and a conventional man-to-man defense will have to carry over for USC to stop the current Pac-12 scoring leader in redshirt junior forward Tres Tinkle. At 20.5 points, 8.6 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game, the 6-foot-8 forward does it all for Oregon State. After missing two seasons due to a broken foot and wrist, Tinkle has been dominating opponents all season with routine 20-point outings. 
It will be interesting to see how Tinkle matches up against the long reaches of 6-foot-7 junior guard Shaqquan Aaron and 6-foot-10 Boatwright. Despite the impressive potential matchups on the wings, the most important battle within a battle will be which backcourt can dictate the game’s outcome.
The upperclassmen backcourt of Thornton and junior Jonah Mathews will have to square off against the Thompson brothers of Oregon State: Senior guard Stephen Thompson Jr. and sophomore guard Ethan Thompson have scored or assisted on over 60 percent of the Beavers’ points.  
The Trojans will square off against Oregon State at Gill Coliseum at 8 p.m. Thursday.

No power conference has had a single bid in the NCAA men’s basketball tournament since it expanded to 64 teams in 1985, but this year’s iteration of the Pac-12 has a chance to be the first. With no ranked teams and none in the KenPom top 40, the conference is on a virtually unprecedented level of futility.
CBS Sports’ Jerry Palm currently projects the Pac-12 to have two tournament teams, which would be the fewest for a Power 5 conference since the Pac-12 had two in 2012. This continues the trend of the Pac-12’s comparative weakness. Including its previous iteration as the Pac-10, it is the only power conference that has had just two bids in a tournament, which has occurred five times.
The conference’s ineptitude runs deep and across multiple areas. According to CBS’ Matt Norlander, Pac-12 teams had a 92-58 record against Division I opponents during non-conference play, which doesn’t sound bad, until you realize that a lot of those games were against non-Power 5 schools.
A perfect set of catastrophic events has taken the bite out of the conference’s traditionally elite programs. As previously stated, Oregon lost a possible top-five pick in the NBA Draft in Bol. Arizona lost talented recruits, such as Shareef O’Neal, due to its involvement in the FBI’s corruption investigation. Right before the new year, UCLA fired head coach Steve Alford after defensive issues plagued the Bruins during a 7-6 start.
USC’s struggles have certainly played a role in the Pac-12’s lackluster results. The Trojans are at 9-6 and went winless in four games against non-conference Power 5 opponents. Double-digit losses to Texas Tech, TCU, Oklahoma and Nevada proved that USC still doesn’t measure up to higher level programs. A 102-92 loss at Santa Clara was the low point in a wildly inconsistent early season performance.
USC has had to deal with important injuries early in the season, as senior forward Bennie Boatwright and freshman guards Kevin Porter and Elijah Weaver have missed multiple games. The team also lost valuable forward contributors in Chimezie Metu and guards Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart, to the professional ranks. But the Trojans are still struggling  for a team with their talent, which is particularly stinging considering how the conference is up for grabs.
USC’s task is the same as almost every other Pac-12 team: Since a victory in the conference tournament cannot be guaranteed, any team that wants a non-automatic bid will have to play well above its current performance in conference play. Each team already has at least four losses in the first few games of conference play, which will only get worse as the programs beat up on each other.
The conference’s collective incompetence has left it in a no-win situation entering as conference play continues. The Pac-12 needs a few teams to beat up on all the others, yet every team was so bad in the beginning that hardly any of those wins will be considered impressive by the selection committee. If a few teams rise above the rest but beat each other, the committee might feel that none of them has an adequate resume. If one team dominates and wins the conference tournament, that automatic bid will likely be the only one the conference gets.
Norlander outlined the scenario for the conference to get three bids: “Arizona State, Oregon, Washington and Arizona practically need to go undefeated against the rest of the conference (will not happen) and take swipes only at each other to best serve the Pac-12 come Selection Sunday.” 
Given that Oregon and Arizona State already have conference losses, Norlander’s skepticism seems merited.
The Pac-12 had just three teams go to the 2018 NCAA Tournament, none of whom managed to win a game. This is an escalation of the conference’s inadequacy and should be a major wake-up call for its athletic directors.
