Women’s tennis opened its season by competing in two tournaments. At the California Tennis Club in San Francisco, in the Battle in the Bay Classic, the Trojans faced players from fellow Pac-12 contestants Colorado as well as many of last season’s top-ranked teams, such as Pepperdine and Georgia. 
The four Trojans who played in the Milwaukee Classic faced stiff competition, namely from blue-chip programs like Wisconsin and Ole Miss.
Four athletes entered the season with an individual ITA national ranking. Senior Salma Ewing headlines the group, with a team-high No. 18 overall national rank. Junior Eryn Cayetano follows Ewing at No. 56, while sophomore Naomi Cheong and senior Danielle Willson round out the group at No. 81 and No. 118, respectively. 
Freshman Leyden Games headlined the weekend’s results, after winning the singles consolation bracket final at the Battle of the Bay, beating Pepperdine sophomore Nikki Redelijk 7-6, 5-7, 11-9 in the final. In her route to the final, Games put up a fight against Morgan Coppoc of Georgia, the No. 66 player nationally. Games took Coppoc to two sets and a tiebreaker in the main draw after a hard fought 7-5 win in the second set. Games did not sacrifice a set in her first two matches in the consolation bracket, beating San Francisco’s sophomore Caragh Courtney and freshman Simran Chhabra. Georgia’s freshman Guillermina Grant took the first set off Games in their semifinal meeting, but, ultimately, Games won 6-1 in the second set and 10-2 in the tiebreaker. 
“[I’m] just so happy to be finally representing the school,” Games said. “Wearing the colors was super cool … In that moment I was just thinking about the moment and focusing on my breathing and taking it one step at a time.”
Making their USC debuts, redshirt freshman Isabelle Lee and redshirt freshman Snow Han also competed in the singles main draw in San Francisco. Lee advanced to Round of 16, defeating Wisconsin senior Antonela Stoica 6-1, 6-1 before dropping into the singles consolation bracket after a loss against Pepperdine’s Lisa Zaar, a junior ranked No. 53 in the nation. Han and Lee also suffered a first round defeat as doubles partners to sophomores Arianna Capogrosso and Rita Coyler from San Francisco.
Sophomore Naomi Cheong and junior Eryn Cayetano — the No. 7 and No. 5 seeds, respectively — both earned semifinal berths for USC in Milwaukee. In her path to the semis, Cheong took down the women’s singles top seed senior Sabina Machalova from Ole Miss, securing the victory in straight sets 7-6, 6-4. Cayetano did not drop a set through three matches before falling to North Carolina’s Reilly Tran. Sophomores Tran and Fiona Crawley were set to face each other in the final, but the match was postponed after they both fell ill. 
Two freshmen also traveled to Milwaukee for the tournament. After a first round loss to Tran in the main draw, freshman Grace Piper rebounded in the consolation draw, winning two matches, including an impressive 6-3, 6-2 display against Indiana sophomore Laura Masic. Redshirt freshman Gabrielle Lee did not enjoy the same recovery in the consolation bracket, falling to Navy senior Kacey Moore in the Round of 16. 
On the doubles side, Cayetano and Piper won one match against junior Xinyu Cai and senior Ava Markham from Wisconsin but lost in the second round to Crawley and Tran Cheong. 
“Everyone was cheering everyone on,” Games said. “Everyone will update everyone on how [their teammates] did … We’re all very supportive of each other.”

Navigating streaming services for authentic, celebratory Latinx stories can be challenging, especially for young adults who may not enjoy telenovelas as much as their tias and are too old to stream Latinx kids shows like “Soy Luna.” 
But luckily, this guide to streaming Latinx movies and TV has a number of hidden gems from various services that provide a modern take on Latinx culture, and of course, wouldn’t be a complete guide if it doesn’t include one or two classics. 
Control Z (TV Show, Netflix)
Everyone has heard of “Elite” and “Pretty Little Liars,” but what if there was a show that combined both the mystery of “PLL” with the storytelling and intrigue of “Elite”? 
“Control Z” is a Mexican TV drama that follows the student, Sofia Herrera as her school, Colegio National, undergoes a series of targeted attacks from a hacker who is releasing everyone’s secrets to the world. The show was released in May 2020 and released its second season this summer. 
The show is not only suspenseful and entertaining, but it also deals with issues within the mental health sphere and LGBTQ+ community, which are both areas that are often ignored or set aside in Latinx culture. 
Miss Bala (Movie, Hulu Premium) 
The 2019 remake of “Miss Bala” with Gina Rodriguez brought more light to the very real issue of cartel violence from the perspective of women who are taken advantage of. The story follows Gloria, who migrated to the U.S. after being born in Mexico, as she is kidnaped and forced to be a part of the cartel all while trying to figure out what happened to her friend, Suzu, who was also a victim of kidnapping at the hands of a cartel. 
“Miss Bala” deals with real issues facing Latin America such as gun violence, cartels and violence against women while also touching on modern topics such as the identity crisis Gloria experiences as a Mexican American. 
One Day at a Time (TV show, Netflix) 
Norman Lear’s remake takes place in Echo Park, Los Angeles and follows a family of Cuban-Americans across several generations. The family showcases the experience of Penelope Alvarez, a single mother with two kids Elena and Alex and a caretaker for her mother, Lydia Riera. 
This sitcom showcases the authentic experiences of Latinx families in the US as they navigate tradition and preservation of culture with progression. “One Day at a Time” tackles traditionally taboo topics such as post traumatic stress disorder, being both LBGTQ+ and Latinx, religion and sex.
Coco (Movie, Disney+)
It wouldn’t be a complete guide without “Coco.” The 2017 classic follows Miguel as his aspiration to sing leads him to an adventure in the ancestral land. The animated movie takes the time to beautifully represent both Latinx culture and the holiday, Dia de los Muertos, along with showcase what’s at the core of Latinidad: family. 
From the music to the visuals, to the storyline, “Coco” is a modern-day classic that is both comforting and wholesome to watch. 
Good Trouble (Hulu) 
Although not an exclusively Latinx show, “The “Fosters” spinoff show takes place at the heart of L.A. and, similar to its parent show, deals with many Latinx issues. “Good Trouble” follows Mariana and Callie Adams Foster into adulthood and centers on stories of people who are often not the center of attention. 
Mariana’s storyline varies from her navigating being a woman of color in STEM to her finding herself as an adult. Other Latinx experiences include Gael Martinez and his sister, who both struggle to co-exist with their traditional family and their queer identities. “Good Trouble” does a good job of highlighting different struggles and often overlooked experiences of marginalized communities, especially the Latinx community. 
Although it may seem difficult to find authentic Latinx stories in movies and television, there are so many hidden gems out there that deal with real Latinx issues, traditions, and celebrations that are made by and for fellow Latinx community members. This guide is not a tell-all of what good stories are out there, but it does give a general idea of what times of storylines may be of interest to young adults at USC looking to expand their horizons and perspective. 
Selena (Movie, HBO Max)
Another classic must-watch is the 1997 Selena movie with Jennifer Lopez that follows the upbringing and career of Texas Tijana singer Selena Quintanilla. This classic is not only filled with bops like como la flor, la carcacha, and dreaming of you, it provides insight on a singer who inspired many people and dealt with the hardships of being both Mexican and American which was an even greater challenge in the music industry. 
“Selena” is still today one of those movies you can’t not watch at least once or twice a year, despite her tragic death, her story was inspiring and beautiful to follow. 
La Niña (TV show, Netflix)
La Niña is based on a true story in Colombia of a girl who was forced into warfare at a young age and now has to deal with the aftermath of trying to escape the cycle of war and violence she was set on. This includes her having to reintegrate with society and face what she did. 
This story deals with tough issues that are real and have impacted many peoples’ lives. It also provides insight on first-hand experiences of this warfare and does justice inaccurately portraying the issue at hand: violence, trafficking and exploiting children in war.

The women’s soccer team defeated California State University, Northridge 4-0 on senior day in the team’s last match before the start of Pac-12 play. Amid their run of convincing victories and clean sheets, the Trojans continued with a sound victory over the Matadors at Soni McAlister Field. 
The win adds to the Trojans’ 5-2 record and is their fifth consecutive victory following two opening losses. USC’s offense recorded 28 shot attempts to CSUN’s six shot attempts throughout the game.
USC opened the scoreline in the 19th minute when senior forward Penelope Hocking sprinted through the right flank and provided senior forward Jada Talley an assist en route, allowing Talley to score her   first goal of the season. Despite junior defender Isabel Rolley nearly scoring an unexpected shot  from outside the penalty box and freshman midfielder Helena Sampaio hitting a swift volley, the Trojans entered the second half with a one-goal advantage.   
CSUN responded in the opening minutes of the second half, with Northridge’s redshirt sophomore forward Alyssa Aguilar’s ground shot saved by senior goalkeeper Anna Smith. 
The Trojans eventually stopped any chance of a comeback in the second half by slotting three goals past the Matadors within six minutes. In the 70th minute, Hocking received possession from a failed clearance and hit a 25-yard shot into the top right corner of the goal to make it 2-0. A minute later, freshman defender Brooklyn Courtnall found junior forward Hannah White, who rounded CSUN’s goalkeeper before slotting into an open goal. In the 76th minute, freshman forward Julia Gomez dribbled past two Northridge defenders in the penalty box before converting the last goal and cementing the victory. 
“Northridge did a good job slowing us down, and we played into it a little bit,” said head coach Keidane McAlpine. “We didn’t play with enough tempo, enough urgency, enough pace to the game, and that was something we wanted to build in the second half.” 
USC’s defensive backline and  goalkeeper had little to do throughout the game, only facing a total of six attempts with three reaching Smith in goal. The shutout marked the fourth consecutive clean sheet for the Trojans. 
“This is exactly what we expect our team to look like in terms of our defensive presence,” head coach Keidane Mcalpine said. “We want clean sheets. We want limited chances. We want limited corner kicks. I thought we did a lot of that today and kept the momentum that we have been building with our defense and the unity, chemistry and symmetry we have with that backline.” 
Although USC started the season with back-to-back losses against Pepperdine and BYU, the Trojans have turned around their season and are in good shape  ahead of their opening Pac-12 match. 
“It helps to be on a win streak,” McAlpine said. “All of that momentum — getting a lot of people into the game, getting a lot of people into the scoring column, scoring a lot of goals in the last few games gives us an opportunity to really feel good going into the Pac-12.” 
USC plays Oregon State Friday at 4 p.m. at Soni McAlister Field in a heavily contested bout against the undefeated Beavers.

Exploring the cultural and societal impacts of the unprecedented amount of information newly available to people on the internet, Northwestern University communications professor Pablo J. Boczkowski discussed the findings published in his latest book, “Abundance: On the Experience of Living in a World of Information Plenty,” at a virtual Annenberg Research Seminar Monday. The discussion focused on the relationship between Argentines and the online media — specifically, the internet in becoming a part of people’s daily routines and communication methods.  
In addition to authoring three books, four edited volumes and more than 40 journal articles, Boczkowski currently serves as the founder and director of Northwestern’s Center for Latinx Digital Media, and the co-founder and co-director of the Center for the Study of Media and Society in Argentina at the Weizenbaum Institute for the Networked Society in Germany. “Abundance” is among several of Boczkowski’s works focusing on people’s changing attitudes towards the media. 
Boczkowski began his presentation by explaining his hopes for “Abundance” to offer a new way for scholars in his field to analyze the high volumes of data online.
“The basic idea behind information overload … is this notion that there is a sweet spot of information … and after that sweet spot, things go downhill,” Boczkowski said. “This is the main way in which the social and behavioral sciences have approached this experience of living in a world with a lot of information.” 
To Boczkowski, addressing the issue with the term “information abundance” instead of information overload would allow for scholars to understand the world “in a broader perspective.” 
“[If the ‘information overload’ perspective] is not necessarily a limitation, it is, at least, a very partial approach to the phenomenon,” Boczkowski said. “In this book, I adopt the notion of abundance as an alternative to try to understand multiple uses of information — some of which are instrumental, some of which are relational.”
 From March 2016 to December 2017, Boczkowski and his co-workers conducted their research for “Abundance” in Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires and five other provinces in Argentina. Boczkowski ultimately used the data to create what he said is the first book-length text seeking to address “information abundance in the Global South.” Boczkowski’s team performed 158 “semi-structured interviews” and surveyed 700 Argentine citizens in-person. Boczkowski recounted speaking to the citizens about their perceptions of media bias, the negative emotional impacts of regularly consuming news and the outside influences affecting individuals who interact with information online. 
Boczkowski, an Argentine himself, said he chose to conduct his research in Argentina because, unlike populations in countries in the Northern hemisphere, Argentine people experience high rates of material scarcity.
“In the U.S., in Canada, in Germany, in the Netherlands, accessing the technologies that connect people to a world of ‘information plenty’ is something that is quite taken for granted,” Boczkowski said. “But in a country like Argentina … the decision to get access to these tools is much more meaningful because it represents a very important portion of the disposable income of people.” 
Jonathan Aronson, a professor at the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism and in the department of international relations for the Dornsife School, attended the seminar. 
“I think that it brought home some things about [how] … the value of news has been less, even as there is more information out there,” Aronson said. “People absorb a great deal of news — hence abundance, or overabundance. On the other hand, its impact on them seems to be less.”
Yue Yang, another attendee, also appreciated Boczkowski’s comments that addressed people’s increasing distrust towards the media and institutions as a whole. 
“I find [Boczkowski’s] discussion about the ritualization of news and how people devalue news, interesting and relevant,” said Yang, a recent graduate of Annenberg’s doctoral program. “If people are just listening to the news or watching it as something ambient, rather than paying attention to it, and they just keep it around, but do not value or trust it, then maybe media studies people or journalism scholars should also reflect on how they think about the role of news in today’s world.”
Boczkowski encourages readers to “de-center the media when discussing communication phenomena.” 
“Communication is about making meaning,” Boczkowski said. “It’s about making meaning together, and becoming a collective, in the process of making meaning.”

Fashion is taking over the world by storm; as people’s styles begin to change and investment in the world of style changes, it’s difficult to deny the incredible presence of fashion in the world right now. “That’s Fashion, Sweetie” is a column focusing on fashion in the 21st century. With topics ranging from student spotlights to new controversies in the industry to styling, this column is here to offer insight into the industry as a whole. So come, dive in, with me: there are enough outfits to go around. 
Meet Dominic J: a freshman majoring in linguistics from Ohio:
He sits by the fire, the soft glow setting up the vibe perfectly — the air ringing with the soft laughs of happy people and Olivia Rodrigo’s first heartbreak. He laughs a big laugh, tossing his head back as his features melt and reappear from the shadows of the dancing flames. 
He sits, one leg hanging off in his outfit of choice this chilly evening at Parkside: sunglasses and shoes from Nordstrom, purple shirt from his dad, pants from old navy, a thrifted button-down and a necklace from his friend. Relaxed and on par with the current trend of minimalism, but he didn’t purposely seek out this distinct style. 
He likes shopping at thrift stores for the interesting finds lacking at department stores but also sees the economic and environmental benefit of doing so, seeing thrift shopping as a necessity that is at least geared towards some good. 
While Dominic doesn’t consider himself invested in fashion, his relationship with fashion sparks from self-love and the general appeal of looking good. He wears what he likes to wear and sometimes people just happen to like his stuff as well. 
But his journey with fashion began in middle school as a battle against toxic masculinity. Dominic didn’t intend to purposefully have fashion mark his life, however, because it started as a fascination with colors. 
He laughs, a coy smile creeping on his face as he describes the bright, noisy outfits he would wear in middle school. Despite the clashing neons and stripes, Dominic, back then, felt that his style was revolutionary and influential. 
He later grew to be more intentional about his clothing and colors, and the vibe that his style gives off. It’s important to him to stay exciting and new in order to find more success in avoiding one particular style, preferring to be spontaneous in his day-to-day outfit endeavors. 
Still, sometimes he worries that people will view his thrift findings and clothes as too effeminate, but he ultimately believes in wearing what captures his attention. 
Dominic acknowledges that despite the progress humanity has made regarding the LGBTQ+ community and breaking harmful and degrading stereotypes, hesitation and rejection of these progressive changes and recognition continue to exist. Still, he believes in dressing and styling himself in a way that suits him for the day, his mood and what feels most like him at that time. 
Now, he’s grown a fascination with different textiles and materials, revealing a recent fixation on textures and textiles. Currently, his new obsession is linen, drawing his love for the material back to his family’s roots in Lithuania. In his dream outfit, he wears a creamy, eggshell white open linen top, for the playfulness of an exposed chest, that has loose sleeves and a Cuban striped pattern. 
The rest of his dream outfit also draws inspiration from time periods, especially the 70s. The perfect pants to his perfect shirt? High-waisted deep brown pants with a subtle bootcut flare to give his canvas and suede shoes some subtle attention. To finish off the ensemble, stacks of silver rings, long and short necklaces, and his trusty Nordstrom sunglasses. 
Hadyn Phillips is a freshman writing about fashion in the 21st century, specifically spotlighting students and popular controversy. Her column runs every other Monday.

Men’s tennis competed in the Battle in the Bay Classic and the Milwaukee Tennis Classic over the weekend, finishing a successful first few days of competition for the fall season. 
No. 2 seed junior Stefan Dostanic took home the first-place trophy in San Francisco, and No. 5 seed sophomore Lodewijk Westsrate finished in second place.
“Getting wins or just getting match experience right now is just, in a lot of ways, super important,” head coach Brett Masi said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “This isn’t the end all be all, but it’s really nice that we’ve got some early success to start the season.”
Last year, the Trojans won the Pac-12 Championship and lost to Texas in the quarterfinal of the  NCAA tournament.
In addition to singles tournaments, USC put forward two doubles pairs in San Francisco and one double pair in Milwaukee. In the Bay, Dostanic paired up with senior Bradley Frye, and junior Samuel Rubell partnered up with graduate student Paul Barretto. In Milwaukee, Weststrate teamed up with freshman Peter Makk.
Following two victories in the rounds of 32 and 16, Dostanic played in Friday’s quarterfinal against Pepperdine senior Tim Zeitvogel, beating him in two sets, 6-4, 6-4. In Saturday’s semifinal, Dostanic handled Texas Christian University’s Lui Maxted with ease, 6-3, 6-2. The victory sent Dostanic to the championship where he faced off against fellow Trojan Frye.
“​​I did a good job of not giving a lot of free points and just locking down and making sure I wasn’t making too many mistakes,” Dostanic said. “As long as [my teammates] see me putting in extra hours, they know they can also do the same thing and also have good results this year and in the years moving forward.”  
Frye advanced to Friday’s quarterfinals to face TCU’s Luc Fomba, the 2021 Big 12 Player of the Year. After dropping the second set, Frye took down Fomba in three, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, to advance to the semifinals. In another hard-fought, three-set match, Frye overcame Berkeley’s Philip Hjorth 4-6, 7-5, 7 (9)-6 (7), to meet teammate Dostanic in the semifinals. 
In the Battle of the Bay Classic single’s championship, Dostanic took down Frye in two sets 6-4, 7 (7)-6 (2).
Rubell was taken out in the round of 32 by Texas graduate student Richard Ciamarra. 
In Milwaukee, two underclassmen Trojans competed for a championship. 
Fifth-ranked Weststrate advanced to the quarterfinals after two victories Saturday in the rounds of 32 and 16. In Sunday’s quarterfinals, Weststrate took to the court against Harvard senior Brian Shi. After losing 6-0 in set one, Weststrate fought back and defeated Shi in three sets, winning the last two 7-6 (7), 6-2.
In his second match on Sunday, Weststrate faced No. 5 seed Pepperdine senior Daniel De Jonge, winning 7-6 (6), 6-3. 
In Monday’s championship match, Weststrate was the underdog set to match up against Harvard sophomore No. 3 seed Henry von der Schulenburg. Weststrate fell short of the title, losing in two sets 6-3, 6-2.
In the Bay, championship opponents and No. 1 seed doubles team Dostanic and Frye advanced to the finals. Rubell and Barretto, on the other hand, fell short of their goal, losing to Texas sophomore Micah Braswell and Ciamarra, 8-5.
The championship, however, was where the Trojan pair of Dostanic and Frye saw their run come to an end. The duo was ultimately defeated by California senior Yuta Kikuchi and freshman Carl Emil Overbeck by a score of 8-3. 
“We know we’re a good team when we’re playing well,” Dostanic said. “We know that we can beat anyone else in the country when we’re locked in and really playing our best.” 
The young duo of Weststrate and Makk failed to make it past the round of 16 in Milwaukee, falling to Louisiana State University’s sophomore Ronald Hohmann and junior Boris Kozlov. 
Following an impressive first-round win, Makk’s USC debut was cut short after a loss in the second round to Oklahoma junior Mark Mandlik.
“I think guys are happy to now be competing and know that there will be people at matches and there will be other energies from the crowd to feed off of,” Dostanic said. “I think everyone’s just super excited for that.”
The Trojans will look to build on their initial success in the Southern Intercollegiate Championship beginning Sept. 24 in Athens, Ga.

Before the return to campus after more than a year and a half of being online in the midst of a continuing pandemic, USC announced it would require vaccinations, making it the “cornerstone” of the University’s policies to keep the community safe. Despite a 95% vaccination rate — with more students in the midst of the vaccination process — the University allows those with religious and medical exemptions to remain unvaccinated. 
According to the latest numbers from USC Student Health, 2% of the population received either medical or religious exemptions, 90% of which are for religious reasons. 
To receive a religious exemption, students submit a form to Student Health that is then sent to the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life, where it is either approved or denied. 
Students with exemptions are required to test twice a week, compared to once a week for vaccinated students.
The Daily Trojan spoke with Varun Soni, Dean of Religious and Spiritual Life, who reviews religious exemption applications, to discuss the reasoning for the University’s religious exemptions and provide a look into how exemption applications are evaluated. 
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Daily Trojan: Why do we have a religious exemption for the vaccine at USC?
Varun Soni: Well, it’s part of our constitutional law tradition. Freedom of religion is right there in the First Amendment. The first part of the First Amendment is the basis for the founding of the country. 
D.T.: Is there anything [about] the role of universities supporting religious beliefs?
V.S.: The University perspective — we’re really trying to find the right balancing act where we can honor people’s personal beliefs and conscience and honor the free exercise of their religion as mandated by the First Amendment. But, we also have a particular threshold that we’re trying to reach in terms of vaccination for public health perspectives, and so, it is a bit of a balancing act. 
But I do think that universities have to be very clear in supporting religious exemptions because the entire University is based on the First Amendment. There is no research university without the free exchange of ideas, the free exchange of thought, without free speech, without free expression and religion.
D.T.: You talked about balancing religious freedom with the health of the community. Can you talk more about that and how you view it in your own mind?
V.S.: My role in this particular process is to really be the safeguard of religious freedom. And I’m the Dean of Religious and Spiritual Life — my job is to make sure that our community is able to freely express and practice their religion, in a way that is consistent with the Constitution. 
So I lean more on the religious freedom side of things. But I have worked very closely with the Student Health Center just to make sure that our exemption numbers are in line with where we want to be, and we’ve been very pleased with that.
D.T.: Let’s say someone wants a religious exemption. They submit it to Student Health, and then it goes to you. What happens then — what’s your approval process like?
V.S.: My office reviews every individual case, or every individual exemption request. And not all of them are granted, but we do a pretty thorough evaluation of all of them. And we’re generally looking for three things. ‘Does the tradition say anything about this?’ So in other words, ‘Is there a doctrine around this?’ Like you might find with Christian Scientists, where there has been a history of religious and vaccine exemptions as part of religious practice, so it’s a tradition. 
‘Is there a textual basis for it?’ — so is there something from a scripture or a holy text that people are interpreting as mandating or requiring an exemption for that? And is it a sincerely held belief? Are people coming to this sincerely, as opposed to trying to game the system?
D.T.: Let’s talk about the first two first. Are there examples beyond the Christian Scientists group of traditions that require religious exemptions?
V.S.: Dutch Reformed Church, Jehovah’s Witnesses. Those are smaller denomination traditions. What is true is that no major religion has come out and said, ‘Do not get the vaccination.”
We don’t find any traditions saying that. But there are traditions that say, ‘It’s up to the individual to pray upon it, to think about it, to work with their cleric and make decisions for themselves.’
So, even though no tradition has said you can’t have the vaccination, a lot of traditions have in some ways left it open to individuals to make that decision themselves. For example, the Catholic Church hasn’t put a prohibition up against vaccination — in fact, many Catholic leaders have encouraged people to get vaccinated — [but] there are a lot of Catholics who won’t get vaccinated because the mRNA clinical trials used fetal cells, and so that’s their personal belief that comes out of textual tradition. 
Most of the traditions empower their practitioners to make choices that make sense to them based on personal beliefs, and courts won’t differentiate between what the institution might say versus what a personal belief might be. 
D.T.: Then the third one, how do you evaluate sincerely held belief, and how do you dissect whether it’s just a way to get out of the vaccine or something someone really believes?
V.S.:  It’s pretty clear if someone’s going to cite text or scripture or talk deeply about their traditions … But at the end of the day, it is self-reported. I am the chaplain of the University, and I assume the best from everyone … So, unless there were glaring red flags, if people are self-reporting that this is their sincerely held belief, in the absence of any contrary evidence, then that’s what we’re going to accept.
D.T.: You mentioned you declined people. Can you talk about some of those cases?
V.S.:  If you’re getting declined, it’s because you haven’t actually stated a religious belief. There are people who state political beliefs or personal declarations or distrust of the government or distrust of the science. That’s not a religious belief.
D.T.: You had conversations with students about the exemptions, correct? Or was it just the form?
V.S.: I had a few. If we needed some more clarity, we would reach out to some students. Some were on their faces very clear, but we did reach out for some more information.
D.T.: And what would those conversations look like?
V.S.: It was just sort of, ‘Could you explain this in a little more detail, and students always could.’ 
And also for me, it was an opportunity to reach out to students and be like, ‘Listen, you’re religious students. We have an Office of  Religious and Spiritual Life. I’m the dean. Here’s my number, call me for anything.’
D.T.: Did you ever push getting vaccinated at all, or are you just there to support [student’s religious beliefs]?
V.S.: No, that’s not my [role]. I have a role here as the chaplain, which is really to help facilitate this process of religious exemption. The reality is we don’t have a template for this … We’re doing our very best. We’re trying to honor every individual request. We’re trying to do that for all of our faculty, students and staff.
D.T.: Is there anything else you want to add about religious exemptions at USC? 
V.S.: I don’t want anyone in our community to feel that religious exemptions are making them less safe. Given the total numbers, given the weekly testing and the other protocols that people who aren’t vaccinated go through, I don’t think that’s the case at all.
I think that the public framing of it has been, ‘Well, people’s personal beliefs are making me less safe, so do people have a right to personal beliefs that make me less safe?’ On our campus, I think that’s a problematic framing. I don’t see people’s personal beliefs making anyone less safe.

Behind every political success, there are months, if not years, of meticulous planning. This is especially true for political campaigns, where candidates will form exploratory committees years before they even announce whether or not they’ll actually run for office. It is also true for small-scale labor movements. For example, when coal miners in Alabama entered their fifth month of striking, their bills began to pile up at home. Then, their wives stepped in, organizing fundraisers for coal families while their coal miners were on the picket line. 
Regardless of whether one is planning to launch a national presidential campaign or a small local movement, planning remains the most important ingredient. For the organizers of the national general strike on Oct. 15, it seems like they forgot to put that ingredient on the shopping list.
The origins of the October 15th National General Strike are slightly muddled. The strike demands fairer wages, environmental protection, better access to healthcare and other progressive policies. There is a website with the movement’s goals, and there’s even a contact page where the organizer, or organizers, provide their email and a list of their social media handles. 
Unfortunately, the Twitter account they linked was hacked by a user who renamed the account to “Nailgun World.” The hacker offered to return the account to the strike organizers. The organizers, now using a Twitter account named “Labor Movement X,” declined. Labor Movement X, as one will soon find out, is the new organizing group behind the Oct. 15 general strike. 
Not only is the origin of the national strike muddled, but so is the list of demands for the group. When one searches for “October 15 general strike,” the top website lists demands such as a $20 minimum wage, a four-day work week, a 25% corporate tax rate and 12 weeks of paid maternity and paternity leave. On the website that Labor Movement X links on its social media account, the demands differ by a wide margin: a $15 minimum wage, no mention of a shortened workweek, a 28% corporate tax rate and 16 weeks of paid parental leave. 
If one didn’t do more research, they would assume that these are two totally different movements. They could only connect these two dots if they were to come upon a letter on a Google Docs file meant for current union representatives and members.  Embedded in Labor Movement X’s LinkTree, this letter from the National Chair for Labor Movement X states that the Movement “grew out of the viral flyer and social media accounts promoting a national General Strike on the 15th of October… We found that many of the young and enthusiastic original organizers were stepping down, in light of realizing the enormity and complexity of what was being proposed.”  
For loyal supporters of the general strike, this change in leadership without a clear announcement from those in charge makes the general strike seem like a shoddily put-together list of demands that would be better off on an online petition, rather than the basis of a mass movement.
Perhaps that’s why the October 15th National General Strike hasn’t graced the cover of many online publications or newspapers. The entire movement reeks of hashtag activism, similar to the type of activism that engulfed social media during the last few months of tumultuous racial reckonings. 
Take the black square incident for example. What started out as an initiative by two Black women to reflect and call out the music industry’s exploitation of Black talent turned into a worldwide phenomenon that clogged the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, cutting activists and supporters that used the hashtag as a hub of information. 
The main perpetrators of this fiasco were activists who, whether through their own fault or not, fell victim to the performative activism that thrives on social media. Information moves fast through these channels, and it can often spiral so far out of control that it no longer fulfills its intended purpose. 
That’s not to say that it isn’t worth fighting for the demands of the Oct. 15 strike. In fact, a CNBC survey found majority support for five out of six progressive policies, such as paid maternity leave and boosting the minimum wage, which represent some of the October 15th National General Strike demands. 
Unfortunately, the organizers of the strike seem to imply that most of their social media content effectively educates the public. This comes at a time where many on social media are already “educated” thanks to the neverending social justice slideshows that inform social media users of hot- button issues. 
Many already understand why these demands are important, either through their own work experiences or through that of their friends or family. The strike does nothing to capitalize on an already educated and supportive public. When Oct. 15 comes around, the lesson to future organizers and activists will be to mobilize outside of the confines of social media — to go into local communities, educate and radicalize your neighbors, support a local union or simply stop and reflect on what made past strikes and movements successful. If we don’t learn from the mistakes of this strike, we’re doomed to repeat them later on down the road.

As most of us are aware, the Taliban have now successfully taken over the entirety of Afghanistan, minus a few contested territories. After 20 years of continuous conflict and the loss of 2,448 American service members as of April 2021, former President George W. Bush’s War on Terror has reached a shocking conclusion in what seemed like only a matter of a few months. However, why are so many members of the Generation-Z and millennial cohorts unaware of all the details, especially of a conflict that has persisted for their entire lives, and is there anything that can be done in terms of recovery for those affected or educating ourselves?
To properly address the gravity of the situation, it’s important to first understand the conflict’s origins.
In the early 90s, the Taliban originated in Afghanistan after the Soviets’ withdrawal from the Middle East. With financial support from Saudi Arabia, the Taliban sought out and enforced a very specific and restrictive version of Sharia Law — the legal system of Islam based off the Quran — throughout Afghanistan. 
At that time, however, the Taliban weren’t seen in the same light. They built their legacy by squashing government corruption in Afghanistan, an issue created and exacerbated by constant United States and European military interventions. Consequently, these extremists managed to portray a savior façade in the eyes of those left helpless.
As the Taliban’s violence and audacity sharply increased in the mid-to-late 90s, they didn’t face genuine resistance until the U.S.’ intervention in 2001. Nonetheless, 20 years later, here we are, with countless innocent lives lost, seemingly back to square one. 
If you were already aware of the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, good for you — you are moderately up-to-date on current events. However, the fact is that many people — possibly including yourself — are uninformed of the specifics and complexities of the U.S.’ involvement, influence and loss over the past couple of decades. This is because of one blatantly obvious reason: We have become desensitized as a generation.
If you were born in 2001 or later, the U.S. has been at war for 100% of your life. We are so used to hearing about American life being lost abroad that we barely react when we hear the news of 13 U.S. soldiers losing their lives in Kabul — along with 60 Afghan refugees — or that more than four times the number of combat deaths post-9/11 are representative of veteran suicides. 
These facts may receive a repost or small conversation, but there are always bigger things to talk about, such as Kylie Jenner’s second pregnancy or Drake’s new album. This war isn’t new, and it isn’t fresh. The issue is not the fact that this information can be disheartening or even disturbing; instead, we find it mundane because we’re so used to it. 
That’s why it’s an interesting experience to be Gen-Z in America. Our entire lives have been occupied by the white noise of war. Programs such as the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps have become so normalized because of our accustomed nature to continuous combat. We have become so acquainted with war that we even allow it to dictate our educational systems and our nation’s understanding of itself. We’ve dug ourselves into an undeniably deep hole when it comes to international conflict.
And the glorification of such a militaristic cultural ideal presents its own issues. Not only do we become desensitized to the conflicts themselves, but we also develop a defense for those already riddled with the urge to ostracize other religions and ethnicities. When postulating bias as a necessity, in this case portraying America’s belligerent prowess as a frontage that must be maintained, we fall down a never-ending cycle. We feed the public illustrious images of our military’s victories, ask for more tax money, grow our military branches, meddle with other nations, and repeat — and Americans who already hold dissonance in their hearts are able to utilize renewed xenophobia as ammunition.
However, there may be some hope left. If we break away from our usual mindless scrolling on Twitter or Instagram and decide to try, at the very least, to have a lasting impact on something that has long impacted us, there are small ways to pitch in. Gen-Z has managed to reshape the political climate and the way in which foreign policy is approached. Now, even university students can attempt to influence this country’s international outreach. 
The U.S. has managed to evacuate 65,000 Afghan refugees, 24,000 of which have been relocated in the U.S. There are organizations that donate supplies and finances to refugees across the country. One of the most prominent of these affiliates is the Welcome to America Project based in Phoenix, Ariz. They are currently accepting monetary donations, as well as gift cards and gently used clothing and toiletries. Other organizations with similar goals are Human Rights First and the International Refugee Assistance Project. 
If monetary-based donations aren’t really an option — as many college students may attest — you can reach out to the California Department of Social Services Refugee Programs Bureau. Take five minutes out of your day and contact these organizations. It will definitely be more fulfilling than reposting something from CNN.
