Junior receiver Ronald Johnson broke his collarbone in the mock game at the Coliseum Saturday, leading to what could only be termed a vast sense of uneasiness within the Trojan faithful.
I’m here to settle that apprehension.
Yes, Johnson was lined up to start opposite redshirt junior Damian Williams this season, replacing the gone-to-the-NFL Patrick Turner.
Yes, Johnson — the 6-foot, 190-pound speedster — was the Trojans’ primary big-play threat last year, leading the team with 17.3 yards per catch and hauling in an impressive eight touchdowns on only 33 catches.
And yes, freshman Matt Barkley will need all the help he can get with USC’s tough slate of road games that begins with a contest in the Horseshoe on Sept. 12.
Nevertheless, I’d argue that RoJo will hardly be missed.
Thirty-three catches is only 33 catches, no matter how you look at it.
And Williams should improve on his 58-catch, 869-yard performance of 2008 while making waves in the Heisman race. And senior tight end Anthony McCoy should display a better grasp of the offense in his second year as the starter and nearly double his 22 catches. And the carries handed to the star-studded quartet of running backs should increase even more.
But most importantly, the young receivers waiting in the wings should finally break out.
Redshirt junior David Ausberry will finally make good on his long-lofty expectations. Coming out of high school in Lemoore, Calif., Ausberry was a nearly unanimous first-team All-American. Since then, he’s caught just 30 balls in two full seasons. He’ll be expected to be Barkley’s No. 2 target until at least mid-October, when Johnson could return.
Freshman Brice Butler will get his first game action after redshirting in 2008. At 6-foot-3, he’s taller than Johnson and not as much of a burner, but the Georgia native possesses lightning-quick speed in his own right with gazelle-like legs.
“I’m ready for it,” Butler said after he learned of Johnson’s injury. “Last year I wasn’t ready. I thought I was, but I wasn’t. But now I feel like I’m ready and more mature.”
And freshman wide receiver De’Von Flournoy — the closest thing to RoJo on the USC roster — will follow in the path of Johnson and Steve Smith before him and see significant snaps as a true freshman.
“Flournoy has been special at times, and you can see it when he gets the ball in his hands,” coach Pete Carroll said. “He has really good quickness and explosiveness and has no problem catching the football.
“He’s behind in the learning process, but we’re going to have to accelerate that to fill the void here.”
Redshirt junior Jordan Cameron is the possession receiver of the reserve group. At 6-foot-5 and 220 pounds, he brings a tight end’s frame but a wideout’s hands to the split end spot. Sophomore Brandon Carswell and junior Travon Patterson each bring versatility and return skills to boot.
It adds up to what Williams says is a more-than-capable bunch.
“Ronald’s one of our faster guys, but Brice is fast, De’Von’s fast,” Williams said. “And Jordan Cameron’s got great hands, so each guy brings different assets that are vital parts of the game that we all need. The guys just have to be ready to step up and fill in the spots.”
The three, despite their ages — Flournoy is 18, Butler is 19, and Cameron turned 21 last month — are among the most poised Trojans. Butler could very well be the most confident player on the team. And that’s exactly what Barkley needs — a confident, ready-to-learn receiving corps.
“RoJo was a gym rat,” Williams said. “He wanted to be the best and he worked maybe the hardest of anybody on the team, but the best thing about each of our guys is that they’re all willing to learn.”
As for Williams himself, he spent all of spring and fall practice preparing to play split end — a spot usually reserved for the bigger and stronger of the two receivers — because of Johnson’s presence at flanker. But when Johnson went down and the 6-foot-4, 235-pound Ausberry took his place in the offense, Williams moved back to flanker, where he set up shop across from Turner in 2008.
“It’s not really a difference for me because that’s what I played last year,” Williams said. “I know all the positions, I move around a lot, so it’s really more of switching my mentality from one spot to the other.”
And that’s exactly what the receiving corps, as a whole, must do: switch its mentality.
Ausberry must become Barkley’s short-route outlet opposite the tight end. Butler must become a deep threat out of the slot. And at least one out of Flournoy, Cameron, Carswell or Patterson must show consistent flashes of their wide-ranging skill sets.
All three are easily doable. If done in conjunction, the three will mean easy pickings for Barkley and consistent success for USC.

With San Jose State finally on the horizon, the USC coaching staff is in the process of determining who will play where against the Spartans on Saturday.
The first order of business: setting the starting offensive line.
Hole to fill · Kristofer O’Dowd’s kneecap injury has prompted a small shuffling of the offensive line. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
With junior center Kristofer O’Dowd out for the opener with a dislocated right kneecap, offensive line coach Pat Ruel has adjusted his five-man lineup.
Redshirt senior Jeff Byers will slide over to center from his usual spot at left guard; redshirt junior Butch Lewis, who started at right tackle last season, will take Byers’ spot.
“I think Coach Ruel’s trying to get his best guys on the field, and he sees Butch as the next guy in line,” Byers said after practice Tuesday. “Butch is smart and he understands how to play football.”
O’Dowd, named on the preseason Rimington Award Watch List, missed all of spring practice while recovering from shoulder surgery. While he was out, Byers practiced at center with a few players filling in at the guard spots.
“I think it was something that was kind of planned the whole time,” Byers said. “I don’t think, with the injury Kris had, that there’s any point in rushing him back.”
And while O’Dowd has served as the de facto leader of the offensive line for the last two seasons, calling out protections before every snap, linemen say it should be a seamless transition for Byers.
“Kris is gonna be there,” said senior Alex Parsons, who is slated to start at right guard after starting the final 10 games there last season. “He’s just not gonna be on the field with us. We’re still prepared and we’re still confident about Jeff making the right calls. It’s just another guy in there.”
Sophomore Tyron Smith is penciled in as the starter at right tackle, causing Lewis to move over to the guard spot. Other players likely to see time on the line include redshirt senior Nick Howell and redshirt junior Zack Heberer.
“I think that’s the great thing about having eight or nine guys that can play,” Byers said. “I don’t think we’re in a state of flux at all. Yeah, we’re missing a great guy who makes the team better, but at the same time, we aren’t taking a big step backwards.”
O’Dowd said on Monday that he hopes to be back for the Sept. 12 contest at Ohio State.

It’s been four days since junior receiver Ronald Johnson broke his clavicle catching a 34-yard pass from true freshman quarterback Matt Barkley in Saturday’s mock game.
Since then, redshirt junior David Ausberry has taken his spot — and the spotlight that comes with it.
“It’s very unfortunate for him, but it’s an opportunity and I’m gonna do whatever I can with it,” Ausberry said. “We’re gonna be ready for whatever role we need filled.”
The 6-foot-4, 235-pound split end will fill the spot Johnson’s injury created, but the two are certainly different players.
“We’re receivers,” Ausberry said. “We both catch the ball. But he’s one of those guys that we put on the perimeter a little more. I’m more of a jump ball, go across the middle kind of guy.”
u
Backup quarterback Aaron Corp, recovering from a cracked bone in his left fibula, said Tuesday that he has no plans to transfer.
Corp, a redshirt sophomore, had been named the starter in April, but lost the starting job to Barkley in recent weeks.
u
Coach Pete Carroll announced that Devon Kennard and Jarvis Jones — both true freshmen — will receive playing time in Saturday’s opener. Carroll even brought up the possibility that Jones will rotate in for starting strongside linebacker and redshirt senior Michael Morgan in the first quarter.
Kennard is listed as the primary backup to junior Everson Griffen at one defensive end spot.

Fall began differently for Rebecca Soni this year as she returned to USC for the first time as an alumna and not a student athlete, following her stunning performances at the World Swimming Championships in Rome this summer.
Soni’s unbeatable streak did not fade as the competition commenced in Rome this past July, with Soni taking gold in the 100 breastroke and smashing Australian breastroke typhoon Liesel Jones’ last individual world record in the semifinals with a time of 1:04.84.
Lasting legacy · Rebecca Soni left USC as one of the best female swimmers ever to wear Cardinal and Gold. She has continued her success in the Olympics and most recently this summer at the world championships. -  Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
But It was her 200 breastroke, the event in which she claimed her first Olympic gold medal in Beijing, which raised eyebrows — though not in the usual way.
“I overthought the 200. But the first 100 felt great,” Soni laughed, recalling the exhausting final 25 meters that cost her a place on the podium.
Soni, who is known for her accelerating finishes, led the field by more than a body length for most of the race, and was 1.55 seconds ahead of world record pace at the 100-meter mark and 1.22 seconds ahead of world record pace at the final turn. Somewhere, about halfway down the homestretch, she hit a wall.
“I just started cramping up. I wouldn’t take it back though, it taught me a lot … It’s not just always about what place you get, it’s all a learning experience,” Soni said.
Soni managed to come back from her disappointing performance in the 200 breaststroke and achieved a suprisingly good result in the 50 breastroke, an event which Soni has rarely focused on.
“It was fun, I had never swam it at an international meet before, so I had no expectations,” she said of the 50-meter.
The combination of Soni’s experience in the 100 breastroke and a killer start resulted in a new American record and a silver medal in the event with a time of 30.11 seconds, just two hundredths behind gold and the world record.
Her road at USC has been studded with success stories — though not without battles — the first involving undergoing a heart surgery at the end of her freshmen year.
Soni also faced a rocky transition with the team’s new head coach, Dave Salo, who arrived on USC’s pool deck the summer before her sophomore year. His unique and eclectic coaching methods meant that he and the team’s star breastroker did not initially see eye to eye, a trust issue many athletes find difficult to overcome in a new program.
Over the next three years, however, their professional relationship became one of equal respect and understanding, enabling Soni to splash her way into the record books, over and over again.
“Once I learned to use Dave’s methods and apply them to my own training needs, and once I learned to trust him, he really helped me,” Soni said. “He’s actually a fun guy, I think he’s great.”
In March, Soni became the first woman to win the 200-yard breastroke in four consecutive NCAA Championships, making her the most successful 200-yard breastroker in college sports history.
She is no stranger to record boards; her name is emblazoned across the walls at McDonald’s Swim stadium, along with race times that would make many male breastrokers pale in comparison. Yet, although Soni has undoubtedly established herself as a demolisher of both American and world records, it has often been the achievements closer to home that have made the biggest impact on her admirers.
Soni’s ability to inspire and support her fellow teammates every day in practice has proven to be invaluable, leadership that will be undeniably missed.
“I never swam on a high school team, I only ever trained club, so the team environment in college swimming was new to me,” Soni said.
Soni was able to use much of her experience on the international circuit to help motivate her fellow Trojans, and she quickly found that this new sense of responsibility changed her mentality about swimming.
“Being a part of a team changes the way you compete, especially at dual meets,” she said. “You’re more concerned for the team than just yourself. You become less focused on winning for yourself, and more focus on winning to motivate the team.”
So what’s next for Soni as she returns to the pool deck this fall semester?
As a professional athlete, she will be spending much of her time discussing sponsorship deals, particularly in light of the newly passed rule by FINA, the body that governs swimming and diving. The rule involves  racing suits, banning all textile fabrics and full bodysuits, which will possibly open the door to more sponsorship opportunities for Soni.
With more free time, she said she has a desire to get involved in charity work, as well as some more lighthearted activies.
“I can’t disclose much, but just make sure you watch the season finale of Shaq Vs.,” Soni hinted.
Meanwhile, Soni will continue to train with Salo at the Trojan Swim Club. Despite the familar Trojan environment, Soni said things will be different this year.
“It’s hard to move on after college, hard to not be a part of the team,” she said.
Soni takes pride in the potential of USC’s young swimming and diving team, and is excited to watch the team she helped build carry the momentum she left behind.
“This team is going places,” she said.
Soni may be beginning a new chapter in her life, but no matter where it takes her or how many records are broken, she will always be welcomed with open arms at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, where her influence reached well beyond her accomplishments in the pool.

This weekend, I flew across the country to my favorite city in the continental US: Boston. Say it with me now, “Baawston.” There, I did a few of my favorite things: I devoured some lobster bisque, spent a few hours at Newbury Comics and even enjoyed some of the best crab cakes I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Then, in between a tropical storm and a malfunctioning subway system I helped my little sister move into college.
It’s strange to think that my little sister, the girl I have come to associate with home, is off somewhere growing up. As we moved boxes and plastic bins into her room and transferred all of her clothes from weary suitcases to pristine closets, I thought about my own memorable afternoon — the broken elevators, the paranoid parents and trips to Target so often that the person working at the cash register could differentiate us from all the other Asian families.
As a restless, somewhat rebellious teen, I craved separation. Every year, I left the house for an extended vacation disguised as an enriching educational experience — no, no, I’m not talking about college. It was a glorious thing I knew as freedom; you might recognize it as summer camp. My parents helped me pack, bought me necessities like bear repellent and cried when I said my goodbyes. Then I was off — off to meet people, find myself and return with a slightly more balanced character. They were excited for the social awareness and newfound appreciation for nature I would gain; I was excited for the campfires and the s’mores, the canoes and the boys, the three-hour hikes and — the best part — being away from home.
During the few short weeks I was off being an independent woman, I learned a fair amount of things. I learned some new sing-alongs and camp cheers and  I dabbled in the art of watercoloring and finger painting. I even managed to do the splits one summer, although I can’t say this was because of any sort of diligence, patience or even flexibility on my part. Important advice: Never go down a dangerously inclined gravel road with broken roller skates. More important than any of these lessons, however, was the realization that I was off on my own. Detached from my parents, from my family, from home-cooked meals and warm soup when I was sick, I had to learn to fend for myself — amid the bears and mountain lions and bloodthirsty wasps, yes, but also amid the realities of a world that would never take care of me.
But that’s not to say I was alone. I had camp counselors — mentors who were sometimes a little too eager but were always, at the end of the day, wonderfully supportive. I had my friends and cabinmates, I had small woodland creatures and I had the occasional letter with a return address I could recognize. But I had to keep the bear repellent on me for only a few short weeks. No matter what I said or thought about leaving home, coming back was always a windswept relief — nothing feels as good as a parent’s open arms or your bed and its perfect, slight body indentations meant just for you.
When I first went to college, I was a little terrified. Weren’t you? I prepared myself in the same way I prepared for summer camp — my parents even supplied the pepper spray, since, according to them, “There are worse things than bears on the streets of LA.” There were tears and goodbyes and freedom and, hidden underneath the excited frenzy of freshman year, the familiar ache for home. But I also found comforts in similar ways, in RA.s and hallmates and friends, in Facebook messages and letters and phone conversations. And I did learn things, like quantum mechanics and the definition of literature and the present pluperfect Spanish. But the best part? The best part was when I came home for Thanksgiving and realized that during the few short months I was off being an independent woman, I had somehow become, miraculously and suddenly, an independent woman.
So I propose a toast: To all the mentors, handwritten letters and bear repellents. To you, an independent person. And to my little sister, who will return home this Thanksgiving with eyes a little wiser, just as beautiful as she’s always been.

After much anticipation, Los Angeles indie pop band The Happy Hollows releases its first full-length album this fall. For those lucky enough to have seen the eclectic group live on campus at KSCRfest last semester or for those who where hooked on its Imaginary EP, the wait is finally over. To say that this album will put a “spell” on you is an understatement.
On Spells, this three-piece band combines rock, punk and pop in a very noisy yet catchy and overly compelling manner.
Sarah Negahdari is the lead singer and guitarist for the band. She combines an angelic voice with loud guitar strumming and finger-tapped arpeggios under a disguise of an eccentric and mischievously sweet little girl. She encompasses all it is to be unique and popular at the same time; in a way she embodies the indie music scene today, eccentric but “in.”
Next to Negahdari, Charles Mahoney (bass/vocals) and Chris Hernandez (drums/vocals) bring a special groove to the band that makes The Happy Hollows stand out. Such a grooving rhythm section in punk-rock is hard to come by in today’s fast paced musical world.
Although they would be catalogued correctly as punk or rock, The Happy Hollows internalizes these sounds and come out as something more experimental yet pleasant to hear. They are not afraid to innovate and break all boundaries to get a great sound. They are a band that will soon stand out and be pioneers while we try to start defining the sound of our next musical decade.
With the release of this album, due out Oct. 6, The Happy Hollows breaks from being another cool band you heard in a local venue and become a band that tours the country, at first with other bands and later headlining their own shows. Their musical career will take a turn for the better and will let the world see and hear what we Angelenos have for a while now.
The first song on the album encompasses perfectly the norms the band makes and breaks. “Faces” starts out with a choppy yet catchy riff that is then is accompanied by a grooving bass line and relaxed beats. The voice is never flat and carries the song melodically into the chorus.
“Silver” is another great example of how the band is not afraid of innovating and, although the song is intimidating at the beginning, it is later very entertaining.
The song starts out as a dance-y beat, and then is accompanied with an overdriven and compressed voice. After an initial reaction of dislike, the song turns into a head banging masterpiece that harks back to the times when Smashing Pumpkins and Garbage ruled music, very similar to what The Silversun Pickups bring to the table.
The lyrics in the songs are at once surreal and universal. They take us through kaleidoscopes of the feelings we once lived or thought we lived in our childhood. Who’s afraid of the monsters in my room? / I like them, is a line taken out of the childhood of a boy who has grown up and thinks he understands life. In the end, the boy is just upset that he lost his innocence and he tries to get it back through indie music.
One of the only critiques of Spells is probably that it is too long to be a debut album; 14 songs are too many to catch new fans’ attention quickly. On the other hand, there are plenty of songs for previous fans to enjoy, though it is sometimes hard to skim through the album and find the best songs.
The album is a culmination of their work with producer David Newton, a former member of The Lemonheads. It contains some of their older songs included in the Imaginary EP, which Newton aslo produced, such “Lieutenant” and “Tambourine.” These are great songs and there was no reason to leave them off the album.
The influences of grunge are clear in this band, but are also combined wittingly with the art rock of David Bowie and David Byrne, and ’80s pop music of the very missed King of Pop, Michael Jackson.
You can catch The Happy Hollows live at Spaceland on Sept. 4 for the Spells release party and performance.

There’s something seductive about the idea of roaming the world as a vagabond, drifting from place to place with no agenda and never looking back. Pirates, nomads and gypsies have done it with great success. To most of us, though, it’s an alluring idea and nothing more.
The explanation is rather simple: We have lives to live, classes to attend, bills to pay and friends and family to support. As creatures of comfort, we like to stay rooted, and have secure jobs and places to call home.
But what if living as a vagabond didn’t have to be just a theoretical lifestyle confined to our imaginations? What if we could really drop everything — work, school, the daily grind — and just leave?
Technically, we can. That’s what 25-year-old Brian Lio, who received a bachelor’s degree in computer science from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 2006, realized two years ago.
“I was always frustrated by the way everyone I met ended up talking about the same goals and dreams ‘to quit and just go travel to amazing places,’” Lio said. “I never understood why no one would actually do it.”
When Lio met like-minded Robert Ward, who received his bachelor’s degree in physics from Grinnell College in 2006 and a graduate degree in social entrepreneurship from the University of Washington, Seattle, things instantly clicked. The two turned their common ideology into an idea they could share with the rest of the world: Jet Set Zero, a website that follows four college-grads-turned-vagabonds via streaming video, photos and blog entries as they hop from country to country on a “zero” budget.
“Jet Set Zero started from endless conversations about getting up, taking a risk and heading out on the adventure we had always dreamed about,” Lio said.
Jet Set Zero has grown over the years, with the addition of 24-year-old Jen Cheng, who received a bachelor’s degree in commerce from the University of Lethbridge in Canada in 2007, and 26-year-old Nick Amante, who graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 2006 with a bachelor’s degree in information technology.
The travelers abide by three rules: they must fund themselves on three months of low-paying work in the US (under $10 an hour); they must experience their host culture through local jobs and friendships; and they must give themselves three months in each country to succeed or fail.
“We’re not tourists and we’re not backpackers,” the website insists. “We come to live, work and play locally. We want to feel the day-to-day texture of life for people our age.”
Every three months, the team starts fresh in a new city, with the hope of attaining a new job, new living arrangements, new friends and a new life-changing experience. So far, they’ve lived in three different countries — Vietnam, Japan and South Korea. They have recently moved to Turkey to film their fourth season.
The nomads began their journey in Saigon, Vietnam, where they tasted their first helping of culture shock — quite literally, in meals consisting of goat udders and cobra blood — and learned, among other things, how to ride a bike.
“The toughest single adjustment I’ve made was learning how to drive a motorcycle in Saigon,” said Ward. “The city is legendary for having dirty, noisy streets packed with motorbikes, none of which follow the rules of traffic — if they exist at all.”
Their next stop was Tokyo — a metropolis of fashion, luxury and, for the dirt-broke cast, a lifestyle they couldn’t afford. Recall rule three, which states that the travelers must give themselves three months to succeed or fail. Saigon was a success: There, they were able to make friends, save money and build a sustainable life. Tokyo, however, was another story.
“In Tokyo, we were completely unable to find work, and lost the thousands of dollars we’d saved trying to feed and house ourselves,” said Ward. “We couldn’t afford to meet many people in the city, so instead of fully experiencing Tokyo and Japan, we struggled to feed ourselves and wound up thousands in debt, homeless and starving for three months. That’s failure.”
Three months can be a long time if you’re broke and hungry. But, as the team found, camaraderie can get you through anything.
“In Tokyo, we literally had nothing but each other and a few incredible local friends to keep up our spirits. It was tough, but friendship saw us through,” said Ward.
Thankfully, their third stop in Seoul offered all of the glitz of Tokyo — at half the price.
“Seoul was surprisingly amazing — I say surprising, because you never hear about it,” said Ward. “The city is just as shiny and intense as Tokyo, but cheaper and the culture is more accessible.”
The 20-somethings enjoyed the perks of Seoul’s city life, particularly its vibrant nightlife. But their time there wasn’t all just fun and games. When protests in Seoul got serious on May Day, for example, the Jet Set Zero team found themselves taking on the role of civilian journalists.
“We … followed a crowd of thousands as they shut down Seoul’s biggest crossroads,” said Ward. “We found ourselves standing in a completely empty street, 12 lanes wide, with an army of riot police on one side, and a wall of protestors on the other. As we were filming, the hundreds of police charged the protestors as we stood in the middle.”
In addition to filming, blogging and acting as civilian journalists for their website — which asks for donations, but doesn’t rake in much money — the team members work local jobs.
As native English speakers, the team members are able to find reliable jobs teaching English, but their jobs have run the gamut from working for travel agencies to editing video game translations.
Still, even with jobs, paying for their nomadic lifestyle is a constant challenge — and something that puts their lives in perspective.
“Relocating is by far our biggest expense, so we’re often facing financial challenges. At the end of the day we’re happy as long as we have a few dollars in our pocket for food and a roof over our heads,” said Lio. “Every day on the road is a good day.”
For the nomads, “home” is a constantly changing notion. Today, “home” may be Istanbul, but tomorrow, it might be Bulgaria, Greece or Croatia, according to Ward. For that matter, it could be anywhere else in the world they can find jobs, access the Internet and film without landing in prison.
Their philosophy is simple, their adventures enviable. For the Jet Set Zero team, language barriers, financial restraints and culture shocks are just part of the endless thrill and excitement of living a vagrant lifestyle.
Not too long ago, they were college grads unsure of where to go next — not far from where most of us are today. Now, they are vagabonds and adventurers in every sense of the word.
“We have tough times and fantastic times on the road, but looking back at this project, I am completely unable to say I wasted a day of the last year of my life,” Ward said. “As long as I can continue to look at it like that, I will keep doing it, and I can’t see that ending any time soon.”

Sunday night was Greek Bid Night, which marked a familiar scene: throngs of girls running down the Row through tunnels of frat boys and the cheers of sign-bearing sorority members.
Recruitment time always highlights the debate over the value of joining the Greek system, and many students at USC feel strongly about the issue. However, as a proud member of Alpha Delta Pi sorority, I will strongly defend the merits of being Greek.
I distinctly recall the horrified look on my non-Greek friends’ faces when I first told them I was going to join a sorority. They stared at me, mouths agape and eyebrows raised, erupting into a chorus of incredulous “why?”s. I have had to sit through many heated sorority-bashing sessions at parties, and just the other day I ran into a boy at the Lyon Center wearing a T-shirt protesting the USC Greek system. The judgment has consistently remained an aspect of my time as a member of the Greek community, and the criticism has worn me thin.
The problem is that most outsiders’ opinions of sororities are derived solely from stereotypes, which are perpetuated by images in popular media. Films and television shows such as The House Bunny or Greek paint a sorry image of what it means to be in a sorority. Sorority girls are depicted as slutty, stupid, catty, self-absorbed and insecure.
Let me tell you from personal experience: these negative stereotypes are uninformed generalizations. It may be fun to bash sororities, but those who are not members of the Greek community can never really know what goes on inside the closed doors of the houses on 28th Street.
The friendships formed in a sorority are invaluable and genuine. We do not pay dues to have a bunch of girls stand around and pretend to know us; the point of a sorority is to develop a true sisterhood. A sorority is a home away from home. It is a place girls can come back to at the end of a long day and feel comfortable and welcome.
Particularly for freshmen away from home, a sorority can provide a safe and fun environment to feel at home on the sprawling USC campus, not unlike other recreational clubs.
Of course, not everyone in a house is best friends with one another, and some of the houses are better at fostering loving environments than others. Still, each house represents a different family, and that family provides love and support to its members.
The recruitment process allows each potential new member to get to know every sorority and decide in which one she feels most comfortable. It is a long and grueling five-day process, but it is structured in such a way that each rushee gets to know all 10 Panhellenic sororities at USC and vice versa.
Each house’s selection process is different. Though I am not familiar with practices outside of my own, there is absolutely no hazing involved and girls are selected after careful review of how well they would fit into a particular house. It is not about how hot they are or how much money they have. Recruitment is about finding girls who the members feel would be good additions to their family, and it has developed over time to ensure it is a mutual selection process.
Girls going through recruitment wear dresses and high heels to give good first impressions because time is limited at each house. The girls who choose to become Greek on Sunday night do so because a house wants them to be sisters — hopefully they feel the same.
Being in a sorority provides girls with many opportunities to learn leadership and relationship skills that are invaluable for future employment, because each house is self-governed and relies solely on its members to function smoothly. The Greek community at USC has continually achieved a higher GPA than the all-undergraduate average, which suggests that Greeks do more than party all the time.
In fact, Greeks are actively involved in multiple organizations on and off campus and participate in many athletic and service-based activities with other Greek chapters at USC. Yes, there will be sorority girls out on the Row on Thursday nights, but they will also be raising their hands in class to answer questions and helping the community with Troy Camp or the Helenes.
Forget what you have heard about each of the chapters at USC; the stereotypes about each house are as broad and untrue as the ones made about sororities in general.
Judging sororities based on hearsay is as naïve as pretending to know everything about any other culture outside of one’s own. Each individual member of the Greek society is different: Form an opinion knowing they are girls in sororities, not “sorority girls.”
Joining a sorority is a very meaningful, personal decision, and is, in my opinion, a very good one.

Wide-eyed with naïveté, the first-year girls toil away to create the sought-after, flawless sundress-and-slingbacks combination. Choruses of “Does this skirt make my butt look big?” ring throughout the residence halls. These newly minted 18-year-olds painstakingly experiment with every detail right down to the flavor of their lip gloss, all in hopes of finding a home to call their own.
Sound like a pack of fastidious Russian mail-order brides? Think again. This is a peek inside sorority recruitment at USC.
There are definite benefits to joining a Greek organization at USC, such as the opportunity to make friends, network and participate in community service. But, often these positive characteristics are overshadowed by the overwhelming and emotionally damaging process of recruitment.
Greek recruitment, known nationwide as “rush,” is an archaic process based on superficial standards that often requires students to put themselves at risk as a part of dangerous “group bonding” activities.
Regardless of the fact that Greek life is a long-standing tradition at USC that contributes to the campus experience in many beneficial ways, the Greeks have received abundant censure from university officials, parents and students alike in recent years because of questionable recruitment and pledge-period traditions.
In order to strengthen USC’s Greek system and restore its respected position on campus, recruitment must be reformed. Making changes by standardizing a less superficial recruitment process and cracking down on frightening practices such as alcohol hazing, will be for the betterment of our campus as well as the psychological and physical health of our undergraduate population.
For the women on campus, sorority recruitment is an emotional disaster. It is almost as if the Panhellenic Council used a research squad to discover when the most women on campus would be menstruating so as to inflict as much pain as possible by also scheduling sorority recruitment the same week.
The Janes are told what to wear by Panhellenic, which encourages the gals with such pearls of wisdom as, “Wear a nice dress — such as one you might wear to an afternoon wedding,” based on which day of the circus is taking place.
Dressing to impress is key, because when the unsuspecting girls arrive — eager to enter the promised land of “sisterhood and character development” — it is undisputed among the ten houses that physical presentation is a key component when deciding which girls will receive bids to join a sorority.
The process is different for men, but the dangers of emotional damage posed for the women are replaced by life-threatening physical concerns.
During the men’s pledge period, hopeful members are often forced to chug unhealthy amounts of alcohol while completing exhausting weight-lifting exercises, be at the beckon call of active brothers to complete humiliating tasks and essentially quit all academic and personal pursuits that might rank higher in importance than the fraternity.
In Broken Pledges: The Deadly Rite of Hazing, author Hank Nuwer notes that during 2008 alone, six students in the United States were victims of hazing-related deaths. It is imperative that USC’s Greek organizations revamp their halfhearted efforts to abolish hazing before the same tragic fate befalls a member of the Trojan Family.
These alarming possibilities were presented to the primarily freshmen boys on Aug. 23 and to the girls on Aug. 26, their respective first days of recruitment. Ultimately though, one week is not an adequate amount of time for these young students to adjust to the foreign aspects of college life before beginning a process such as Greek recruitment that so critically evaluates individuals. The harsh realities of rush would best be saved for another time, after students have become accustomed to life on campus and developed stronger senses of self-awareness and confidence that have become necessary to survive USC’s rush process.
Many colleges have seen the merits of these ideas and mandated that Greek recruitment be moved to the beginning of spring semester. At these schools, students who choose to rush return from winter break one week early so that recruitment can take place during a time free from the added stresses of a new school environment and new classes. At the very least, USC Greek life should follow suit by transferring Greek recruitment to the spring to allow for a healthy transition into college life that is void of the judgmental and emotionally draining time that is recruitment week.
In the meantime, Greek recruitment has officially ended as of Sunday evening’s Bid Night. We can only hope that this year’s crop of inductees were satisfied with their experiences, but — until recruitment undergoes major renovations — the USC community continues to await a revised process that is fair and beneficial to the health of our students.

Responding to complaints from parking pass holders — and needing to accommodate construction vehicles — USC Transportation announced last week that they will no longer be offering same-day reservation passes or daily passes for Parking Structure A on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The decision to eliminate same-day passes and daily passes on Tuesdays and Thursdays was made to ensure students with semester parking permits are always able to find parking in the lot located on McClintock Ave. and Downey Way, and includes the office of the  Department of Public Safety.
Parked · Parking Structure A will no longer offer day passes for drivers on Tuesdays or Thursdays in an effort to solve cramped parking. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
“These are the two busiest days as it pertains to traffic and parking demand on campus,” Tony Mazza, director of USC Transportation, wrote in an email. “By making this adjustment to our policy we eliminated the capacity issues and are providing a much higher level of customer service for students who have purchased fall 2009 permits for PSA as well as faculty and staff parking in the structure.”
Students said they had noticed that overcrowding had become a problem.
“Some people just cannot park. I see at least three cars taking two parking spaces and that’s just on one side of the parking lot,” said Lois Lee, a sophomore majoring in architecture.
Additionally, as work on the Ronald Tutor Campus Center continues, USC Transportation has had to make room on the roof area of PSA to park around 150 vehicles from the Tutor-Saliba construction company. These spaces will be reserved for construction vehicles until all work is completed.
“Parking Structure A was selected during the negotiation process by USC Capital Construction and the various union contractors due to its proximity to the actual job site,”Mazza wrote.
Students who park in PSA say overcrowding is an issue, and not only in terms of cars.
“At about 12 or 1 in the afternoon is when workers come in and it gets busier,” said Yongsuck Joo, a junior majoring in business administration. “The elevator gets crowded and it takes more time to go in and out of the building.”
The Transportation office has received complaints about the parking situation in PSA, but feels the new policies are reducing the effects of those problems.
“The complaints we received stemmed from the overcrowding in PSA and students, faculty, and staff not being able to locate a spot in the structure,” Mazza wrote. “Since making the adjustments to our policies, the issues have subsided.”
Mazza also pointed out that parking problems can be amplified because some drivers park in campus structures even though they don’t have the appropriate parking pass.
“Although our parking demand is high, the situation is exacerbated by the amount of illegal parking that takes place on campus,” Mazza wrote. “We have enough space to accommodate each of our  customers but it is important that each of us respects the Parking Rules and Regulations to ensure a smooth experience.”

After the introduction of the proposed Student Savings Club program at last week’s Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting, senators debated the merits and pitfalls of the program Tuesday night and ultimately approved the measure.
The discount program, offered through a company known as the Student Savings Club, will require USC students to present their university-issued ID cards in order to take advantage of financial breaks from local businesses, such as Office Depot and the LA Live restaurants. USG will have to pay an annual fee of $1,700 to the Student Savings Club in order to bring the program to USC.
Some senators, such as residential senator Juan Orjuela, were concerned about this recurring cost and feared it would create financial problems in the future. As an alternative, Orjuela said USG could create its own discount program and actively court local businesses rather than rely on an outside company to do that job.
“I think we should focus on something that will last for more than a year. I know it’s more convenient to have the ID card, but I think building relationships with the community is really important, and with this program, we aren’t building those relationships,” Orjuela said while discussing the measure. “We can get better discounts than the ones we have here [on the Student Savings Club list], and we can expand more and have more businesses approve.”
But other senators, like Greek senator Dylan Dann, said a trial run of the program could benefit students while also saving USG time and promotional costs.
“$1,700 is not much for the service we’re getting,” Dann said. “I don’t think it’s a good idea for USG members to go and do this because [the Student Savings Club] does this. They’re the best at it. We’re not going to be able to get more than they are.”
With 10 senators voting for the measure and one voting against, the Student Savings Club program passed.
USG President Holden Slusher, who presented the program to the Senate last week, said he thinks students will appreciate the discounts, which should take effect in a few weeks.
“I’m excited, and I know students are excited. [The Student Savings Club] offers a valuable service, and if it’s a success, we can continue it on our own,” he said.
Aside from the Student Savings Club program, more initiatives aimed at increasing interaction between USG and the student community are planned for the semester.
Chris Cheng, USG director of outreach, said in Tuesday night’s report to the Senate that he plans to supplement USG’s current promotional efforts with face-to-face networking. USG street teams, complete with appointed regional directors for various campus living areas and the Greek community, will distribute information about USG and collect feedback from students.

After one year of negotiations between the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, officials from USC’s Undergraduate Student Government and university administration, construction on a traffic light at the intersection of Hoover Street and 28th Street has been completed.
Efforts to place a light at the heavily trafficked intersection began in the fall of 2008. Former USG president Jens Midthun and his administration successfully lobbied the city to paint a crosswalk there in the spring of that year, but student safety remained an issue after two accidents occurred despite the improvements, current USG President Holden Slusher said.
Slusher said the new stoplight resulted from discussion at a town hall held last year.
“Students were very concerned,” Slusher said. “We took it upon ourselves to get flashers [for the crosswalk], but we made it our ultimate goal to get a stoplight.”
The Hoover and 28th crossing has seen a total of 10 traffic collisions, six involving bicyclists, from Jan. 1, 2006 to present, but these numbers only reflect those accidents reported to the Department of Public Safety, DPS Capt. David Carlisle said.
The number of collisions — likely higher than the number reported — made safety at the intersection a prime concern, Carlisle said.
LADOT had initially hesitated to grant the university’s request for a traffic light at the intersection, believing the area lacked enough pedestrian traffic to warrant the expense, said Glen Ogura, principal transportation engineer for LADOT.
But after USC invited city officials to conduct a study of the intersection at night, LADOT determined the high volume of students crossing the intersection between the hours of 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. made the traffic light necessary.
“It was really a great partnership between the city and ’SC to make this happen and to make it happen quickly,” Ogura said.
Rather than wait three or four years — the time Ogura estimated it would have taken — for LADOT to place a traffic light at the intersection, the university submitted designs to the city and paid $190,000, along with $10,000 from USG, for the light’s construction. The necessary permits were approved over the summer, allowing the light to be built last week.
“I think it’s awesome that USC fronted that money because even though it took two horrible accidents to get it going, USC was active in getting this done,” Slusher said. “If we partner with administrators, we can get more things done on campus.”
Carlisle said he commends USG’s continued collaboration with university officials in the matter of student safety.
“People would cross in all sorts of directions, and so many students live in that area [and] would brave the traffic,” Carlisle said. “It was a great help to get USC student government to get involved and get that signal up quickly. We think it’s a much safer intersection than it was before.”
Students said they have already experienced positive changes from the traffic light’s construction and hope it will serve as one more step to increase safety in the neighborhood surrounding USC.
“It makes a real difference if you’re trying to turn from The Row. It makes a difference for everybody because pedestrians and drivers are trying to do the same thing, so it can get confusing,” said Noelle Blanchard, a junior majoring in political science and creative writing.
Richard Heredia-Arriaga, a first-year graduate student studying cinema-television production, said he considers the traffic light an improvement on the existing crosswalk at Hoover and 28th.
“It’ll help ensure student safety at school, and school should be a place where you feel safe,” he said. “Crosswalks and pedestrian walks are often ignored by drivers, so I think [the traffic light] is very beneficial and will have a much greater impact than the crosswalk.”
While the traffic light may contribute to a potential decrease in accidents at the intersection, students also have to be proactive in ensuring their own safety by following traffic laws, Carlisle said.
Even though he hopes the new light will make the Hoover and 28th crossing safer for students, Slusher said last year’s fatal hit-and-run at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover was a sobering reminder to remain cautious despite the presence of a traffic signal.
“It’s a matter of comfort for some and confidence for others. Knowing those [drivers] have a red light means a lot,” he said. “But even though there’s a red light, that doesn’t make you completely safe.”
