With the official start of summer just around the corner and a glimpse of those long, hot L.A. days bound to overwhelm us, it’s the ideal time to turn to recipes that tantalize the taste buds even as they cool us down. Summertime begs for quick, easy recipes that privilege fresh, seasonal ingredients and won’t break the bank. Be sure to try and find the freshest fruits and veggies when you can — the Farmer’s Market at Third and Fairfax is a great option, though chances are you’ll leave with twice the amount of things on your grocery list simply because everything looks so good.
Always remember that those favorite summer treats — from frozen yogurt to gourmet Niçoise salad — are usually extremely simple to make at home and worth the effort, if only so that you can claim your summer was “productive.” Below are a couple of ideas to revitalize your summer menus and impress your friends:
Fig Salad
This is a simple salad based on the perfect marriage of flavors between ripe figs — get them from mid-July to late August — prosciutto and mozzarella. Salads of all kinds are ideal during summer, and a little fruitiness can always transform a simple green salad into something memorable.
Ingredients:
(Makes 4 servings)
– 4 green or black figs
– 4 slices prosciutto
– Buffalo mozzarella, sliced
– 1 bag mixed greens
– 1 bag baby spinach
– Green or purple basil
– 3 tablespoons lemon juice
– 1 tablespoon honey
– 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
– salt and pepper to taste
Preparation:
Arrange the mixed greens and spinach in a large salad bowl. Add the figs after making small cuts to expose the insides. Weave in the prosciutto and slices of mozzarella, sprinkling the basil over them as you go. To make the dressing, simply mix the lemon juice, honey, oil, salt and pepper in a smaller bowl and drizzle over the salad for a lush finish. Serve with lemonade and some bread for that extra-summery feel.
Banana Peanut Butter Ice Cream
Ever heard of ice cream without cream? This recipe is healthy, super easy and incredibly refreshing. Best of all, it hits that sweet spot in just the right dosage. This is the perfect recipe to keep up your gourmet façade — your friends will love it and they never need to know it was so quick and simple to make.
Ingredients:
(Makes 4 servings)
– 4 bananas
– 4 tablespoons of creamy peanut butter
– Almond milk as needed
Preparation:
Cut the bananas into small slices. Place them in a bowl and leave them in the freezer until they are frozen over (usually about 2-3 hours). Once ready, blend the frozen bananas with the peanut butter in a blender or food processor until thick and creamy. It can take a while for the mix to reach a truly ice cream-like texture, so check on it frequently as you blend. Add some almond milk if the mixture becomes too clumpy or sticky. Remove the ice cream from the blender and serve with fresh banana slices to garnish.
Mushroom and Zucchini Pita Pizza
This is a very easy recipe that’s quicker and healthier than actual pizza and useful for using all those leftovers you’ve had lying around: veggies, pasta sauce, etc. Another plus of this recipe is that you can add or subtract ingredients as you see fit — meats like ham or cooked chicken can be added and other veggies such as bell peppers or eggplant are equally welcome. It’s a wonderful way of making your own pizza with half the calories and twice the flavor.
Ingredients:
(Makes 1 pita pizza)
– 1 whole wheat pita
– 1 garlic clove, crushed
– ¼ cup sliced mozzarella
– 3 teaspoons Parmesan cheese
– 4 tablespoons tomato-based pasta sauce
– 2 teaspoons dried oregano
– ½ cup sliced mushrooms
– 1 zucchini, thinly sliced
– Salt and pepper
Preparation:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix the pasta sauce with the garlic and spread over the pita until it is evenly covered. Arrange the mozzarella, mushrooms and zucchini on the pita, adding salt and pepper to taste. Top with the oregano and parmesan cheese. Bake in the oven for about 10-15 minutes or until the cheese has melted and the edges of the pita begin to turn brown. Serve with a cherry tomato salad as an ideal accompaniment.
Mint Lemonade
Spice up your regular lemonade recipe by adding a touch of mint for that extra-refreshing taste in the height of summer. Fresh mint leaves are preferable (try to make it the same day you buy the ingredients) but dried ones will do if necessary.
Ingredients:
(Makes 1 jug)
– 6 cups water
– 2 cups freshly squeezed lemon juice
– 2 cups granulated sugar
– ½ cup fresh whole mint leaves
Preparation:
Combine the sugar and 2 cups of water in a saucepan and bring to a boil to make the syrup. Stir until the sugar has dissolved and set aside to cool down. Combine the lemon juice and remaining 4 cups of water in a large jug. Add 1 cup of the syrup and taste. Add more of the syrup depending on desired sweetness. Add the mint leaves and stir. Place the jug in the fridge and allow to cool for 1 hour. Serve over ice with a lemon slice garnish.

Chinatown Summer Nights has mastered the blend of L.A.’s trendiest music and marketplaces with the historic cultural neighborhood in the program’s fourth season. Alight with modern beats and full of surprising histories, Chinatown’s plazas invite Angelenos to eat, drink and dance in honor of the neighborhood’s 75th anniversary on Saturday.

The June 15 event kicks off the summer series, enlivening a neighborhood that often goes silent after dinner. Food service begins at 5 p.m. in a beer garden curated by Eagle Rock Brewery and features more than 10 food trucks, including DTLA favorites like Crepe’n Around and Tornado Potato.
Guests can watch Chinatown chefs and mixologists demonstrate their crafts. The schedule even includes an eating competition in the West Plaza. And Chinatown’s historic family-owned restaurants will, of course, be serving all night.
But most of the action begins after dinner hours end. Jugglers, acrobats and dancers open the Central Plaza’s main stage, sponsored by Santa Monica public radio station KCRW. Station DJs Anthony Valadez, KG Superstar and Liza Richardson will start spinning at 8 p.m.
The live music stage opens with dream pop outfit Cobalt Cranes at 6 p.m., followed by breathy bossa nova grooves from Sister Rogers. Driving dance numbers from Jutty Ranx and grittier punk-pop lines from Echo Park’s Rainbow Jackson follow.
The penultimate group, The Furys, played the opening show at what became a famous Chinatown punk hangout, Madame Wong’s, in 1978. Esther Wong opened the restaurant on Sun Mun Way eight years earlier and featured only Polynesian bands, but as crowds shrunk, she began opening her stage to L.A.’s emergent punk scene. The restaurant closed in 1985, but Madame Wong remains a legend for competing with rival Chinatown venues and maintaining incredible camaraderie with rockers in her heyday.
SXSW veterans Nightmare & the Cat headline at 11 p.m. The five-piece group’s synth-backed, upbeat pop-rock provides an accessible and, more importantly, entirely danceable closer on the stage sponsored by LA Weekly and curated by Kevin Bronson of Buzz Bands LA.
LA Craft Experience, a consortium for L.A. artisans, will bring several dozen handicraft vendors to the Central Plaza. The LACE Market, food trucks and beer garden all begin at 5 p.m. and close at midnight.
The evening’s schedule at every stage clears at 7:45 p.m. for the dedication of a statue of Bruce Lee in the Central Plaza, in celebration of the 75th anniversary of historic Chinatown’s founding. Chinese immigrants arrived in L.A. decades earlier, of course, as early as 1850, and many settled east of El Pueblo Plaza near Olvera Street. At its largest, that settlement boasted about 3,000 people, according to the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California.
But Los Angeles sought ownership of that neighborhood — Old Chinatown — to build Union Station in 1913. After a 20-year conflict, the California Supreme Court upheld L.A.’s proposal, leaving the core of the city’s Chinese community without their 50-year cultural home. For four years, a committee of 28 Chinese founding members worked with L.A.’s cultural philanthropists to find a site for New Chinatown. Ultimately, they settled on the plazas that will host Chinatown Summer Nights. The team found investors and began construction. Amid dancing, live music and hanging lanterns, at least 25,000 people helped dedicate the plaza on June 25, 1938.
Bruce Lee and his family were among those founding members, and Lee remains a cultural icon in China and in L.A., his hometown.
And while the bulk of Saturday’s action takes place in the Central Plaza, visitors should note that the West Plaza includes the culinary stage’s cooking demos and eating competition. The Chinese American Museum will present a family workshop for parents with young children. And before buying crafts at the Central Plaza’s LACE Market, visitors can watch demonstrations of calligraphy, face painting and candy, clay and dough sculpture at the artisan stage.
Chinatown Summer Nights continue on July 20 and August 17. Admission is free.
This sounds like a great festival. Using the Central Plaza is a great idea to get families involved with fun activites related to the Chinese community!

Hopping onto the tech bandwagon is no easy feat these days. The competition that goes on in Silicon Valley for bright engineers and marketing superstars is fierce. But what about Silicon Beach, the SoCal counterpart to the bustling tech frontier up north?
Wired · Robert Lambert saw the need for an online resource and conference to bring together Angelenos involved in the tech world. – Photo Courtesy of Robert Lambert
 
Though it might not be home to massive corporations such as Apple or Intel, make no mistake –— Silicon Beach is making its own strides. And for students in the Los Angeles community, there are many opportunities to be had in sunny SoCal.
Robert Lambert, who serves as the founder of Silicon Beach LA,  is a citizen of both the U.S. and Australia, founding startups in both countries.
“I started very early. … Our family has always been very entrepreneurial,” Lambert said.
Nearly seven years ago, Lambert was running his own company — an eBay for services, of sorts.
“I met a lot of folks and built my own resource for connections. From there, I worked in Sydney, Australia and established even more ties to the community there and in the States.”
These days, students and professionals alike use LinkedIn to connect with others. But Lambert was building a more personal and valuable network, one that he knew he had to share with others.
“In 2012, I came back to Los Angeles, and people were asking for introductions and requesting to use this resource,” he said. “A website was made and we were seeing anywhere from 150 to 250 emails every day.”
Lambert began to brainstorm and gave himself three months to start up and launch what is now Silicon Beach LA, an online community and resource that collects information about news, events and jobs in Silicon Beach.
The official Silicon Beach Fest, which is held biannually, is a conference-like event that brings together entrepreneurs, tech enthusiasts and students for a weekend of discussions, collaborations and hackathons.
On June 15, Silicon Beach LA will also be hosting its Summer Hiring Blitz, a hiring event featuring 80 companies in Los Angeles’s tech and startup community.
“We realized that there wasn’t a real hiring event for those who wanted to get more involved with Silicon Beach and we thought this was what the community needed. One of the biggest concerns especially is letting local college students know that there are really exciting opportunities out there,” Lambert said.
Companies that will be at the Summer Hiring Blitz include Nasty Gal, a booming online retailer of women’s fashions; NextSpace, a co-working space located in startup accelerator Amplify LA’s campus; and Codewars, a company that gamifies and crowdsources code.
To impress companies such as these, Lambert recommends that attendees have in mind which companies to speak with on the day of the event.
“Look through different companies and see who they’re hiring. Be realistic in terms of which companies you decide to approach.”
For those who might not be feeling confident or qualified enough to pursue open positions at this event, there will also be ongoing panels and workshops that discuss topics such as “What I Look For When I’m Hiring” and “How to Improve the Internship Landscape.”
Even if the startup culture isn’t completely up your alley, it might still be worthwhile to get familiar with the tech ecosystem in Los Angeles.
“There’s never been a time like this [for Silicon Beach]. You are seeing people with different levels of experience jumping into the startup world,” Lambert said. “Los Angeles is known for being one of the most entrepreneurial places in the world. There are a lot of talented people here.”
And if you find your match at the Hiring Blitz, Lambert says that the Silicon Beach Fest, which takes place the following weekend, is your time to unwind and get better affiliated with the Silicon Beach community.
“Silicon Beach Fest is a phenomenal opportunity to get everybody together. When you secure your future employment, you can relax and mingle with people a week later. Get a job and go party.”
Sounds like a plan.
 
The Summer Hiring Blitz will be held at Loyola Marymount University on Sat., June 15. Tickets can be purchased online.

Does it ever feel as though life gets too bogged down in the minutiae of “he said, she said” drama? Ever wonder what happens when a Words With Friends addiction gets a tad too extreme? Ever feel unmotivated and unsexy? Trivial and profound questions such as these get their due treatment in The Boomerang Effect, a fresh comedy by Matthew Leavitt.
The honeymoon is over · Newlyweds Renee (Tiffany Lonsdale) and Andrew (Malcolm Barrett) have some trouble settling into married life in Matthew Leavitt’s play, The Boomerang Effect, directed by Dámaso Rodriguez. – Photo Courtesy of David Elzer
Boomerang tells the story of five different couples that are all facing various difficulties in the bedroom: One is dealing with an unplanned pregnancy, another struggles to maintain an exciting sex life, two of the characters attempt to recover from the hurt of adultery and one woman must decide whether to sleep with her boss for a promotion. As each scene plays out, characters reveal that all of their problems are intertwined, and the fate of one couple often relies on that of another.
Though the wobbly plot connections between each vignette feel a little forced, thematic tropes that cropped up in each storyline provided the play with some cohesion. Oddly similar to the seminal Ashton Kutcher flick, The Butterfly Effect, Boomerang tracks the way the words and behavior of one’s family and friends can have negative effects on one’s intimate relationships. The title refers to the way that good intentions can often come back around and cause problems, much like a painful boomerang.
This concept is a widely accepted one, even if its moniker is new, so the multiple monologues that carefully spelled out the title’s significance seem to belabor the issue past the point of poignancy and far beyond the realm of believable dialogue.
The show was stolen by Jonathan Slavin, who easily set himself apart in an ensemble cast of 10 — which is no small feat. As a part of the play’s only homosexual couple, Slavin’s portrayal of David never relies on stereotypical flamboyance, but instead included bitingly delivered snide comments and gleeful witticisms that ought to be trademarked as sitcom catchphrases.
Other standouts among the performers were Tiffany Lonsdale and Malcolm Barrett as Renee and Andrew. As the couple that struggles to transition from the honeymoon phase to steady partnership, both of these actors nailed a realistic balance between caring, optimism, boredom and frustration. In addition, Lonsdale and Barrett went unparalleled in the physical comedy arena, earning laughs from unsexy undressing processes and other failed attempts at seduction. Scenes starring the first three couples were overall tightly rehearsed and allowed for the pithy dialogue to create a snappy, comical tone.
The last two couples, however, somehow lacked the physical chemistry that is so crucial to a play that is set entirely in a bedroom and also failed to keep up with the quick pace established by the previous scenes.
Despite falling victim to a fair number of cliches, Leavitt’s script offers much insight into the infrequently addressed connection between career success and sexual intimacy. Nick (Emerson Collins) observes that he stopped feeling attracted to his partner the moment that partner got laid off and lost any sense of motivation. Julie (Kat Bailess) weighs the benefits and drawbacks of sleeping with a superior in order to get ahead, and Janeta (Vanessa Celso) discusses the pitfalls of office romance and the great effort necessary for many career women to find love.
In addition, Leavitt’s shrewd commentary on the plight of the Millennials in a tough economy felt much less offensive and better informed than the recent Time article that sparked such conversation. Paul (Luke McClure) laments that his “whole generation is developmentally stunted,” and that his job as a bag boy at Trader Joe’s is completely acceptable for a 25-year-old.
The script also dealt carefully with the proliferation of technology and social media in contemporary romantic relationships. One couple argues over the importance of online fantasy football rosters and birthday text messages, while another nearly crumbles because of an affair that began as a simple Words With Friends rivalry. These hip details were enhanced by the work of sound designer Doug Newell, who employs the authentic sound effects of each app when dictated by the onstage action, recreating a soundscape very familiar to members of younger generations.
Despite Boomerang’s attempt to distinguish itself as a unique meditation on the interconnectedness of love lives and the trials and tribulations of modern couples, the fact is that it fails to achieve the same resonance as films as cheesy as He’s Just Not That Into You, Valentine’s Day, New Year’s Eve and the like. The script’s frequent jokes about topics such as Candy Crush, Facebook, Call of Duty and Groupon end up coming off as a thinly veiled attempt at making this play truly relatable to the people young enough to really understand why they’re funny.
In the end, this play is probably more suited to the curious parents of Millennials than actual young people.
 
The play runs June 8 to July 27 at the Zephyr Theatre in West Hollywood. Thursday tickets are $20; Fridays and Saturdays are $25.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety Daily Incident Log between Monday, June 10, and Tuesday, June 11. 
Crimes against a person
At 8:22 p.m. on June 10, DPS officers responded to a report of a non-USC male yelling for help near 2627 Severance Street, and when they contacted him, he said that he was being followed by unknown suspects. Further investigation revealed that the male was a drug user involved in a possible drug deal gone bad and Los Angeles Police Department officers who responded to the scene concluded that he had mental health issues. A Los Angeles Fire Department RA unit then transported the subject to California Hospital for voluntary psychiatric evaluation.
Crimes against property
At 11:13 a.m. on June 10, a suspect entered an unsecured laboratory and removed several unattended dental tools in the Eileen and Kenneth T. Norris Dental Science Center.
at 6:45 p.m. on June 10, DPS officers responded to a report of two suspects carrying two locked bicycles near the George Finley Bovard Administration Building and detained them for investigation. One of the bikes was registered to a student, but the officers were unable to contact her to determine if a crime had occurred. Both bikes were then impounded by the officers and the suspects were released after being advised against trespassing on university property.

John Mork’s long relationship with USC came to a peak last Monday when USC announced that the B.S. ’70 and M.S. ’12 alumnus would become the next Chairman of the Board of Trustees.

After finishing his undergraduate career in petroleum engineering, Mork founded the Energy Corporation of America, based in Denver.
With his wife Julie, John Mork donated $15 million to the Viterbi School of Engineering in 2005 and $110 million to provide scholarships to low-income students in 2011.
John Mork sees his new position as his way of giving back to the university.
“I owe ’SC a lot,” John Mork said. “It’s such a great institution that I was thrilled to serve.”
Before John Mork, Edward P. Roski Jr. led the Board of Trustees for five years.
“I think that I am so lucky to follow the leadership of Roski and Stanley Gold,” John Mork said. “They’re just off-the-charts good, and if you look, universities become great when they have multiple, consecutive, exceptional leaders and presidents.”
John Mork noted that the university has seen an incomparable rise in the past few years. In the most recent U.S. News and World Report national university rankings, USC climbed the chart to number 24, rising 27 places since 1991.
“I don’t think I could get into ’SC now,” John Mork joked. “It has changed so much: the quality of the leadership, the administration, the quality of the professors and the quality of the students.”
This rise in quality has inspired John Mork to continue USC’s success.
“’SC is so blessed and it has a wildly blessed future,” John Mork said. “I think my job is to serve the university and to facilitate President C. L. Max Nikias’ good work — I’m a servant in the deal.”
Mork believes that the key to USC’s advancement lies in trust — trust in the professional staff from workers at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center to the Board of Trustees.
“I’d like to treat others how I’d like to be treated from the top to the bottom,” Mork said. “And I guess I’ll be a little demanding: I will demand excellence of myself as I serve ’SC and command excellence from everyone.”

After submitting itself for reaccreditation from the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, USC’s Dept. of Public Safety was granted a postponement of approximately a year.

DPS Capt. David Carlisle said that the department requested the time in to reorganize its department.
“We decided that, with a change of administration with a new chief, that we were going to reorganize and make a number of administrative changes,” Carlisle said.
The IACLEA represents more than 1,200 colleges and universities in 20 countries. Receiving IACLEA accreditation means that the college’s safety department in question meets more than 220 standards.
USC first gained IACLEA approval three years ago. A group of assessors were scheduled to examine all aspects of DPS in late April. Instead, DPS will focus on fixing its temporary issues before beginning the reaccreditation process.
“There’s going to be some restructuring to the department, additional positions added and two new deputy chief positions,” Carlisle said. “We’re hoping the new positions will be filled by the fall semester.”
An accreditation from IACLEA illustrates to the public that the department is in compliance with the most stringent campus security laws applicable.
Reaccreditation is given once the IACLEA reviews the policies and procedures of the department to make sure that they are still complying with their standards.
DPS hopes to begin the process in the spring of 2014. If received, DPS will be reaccredited for four more years.

Many members of the USC community voiced their concern following the May 4 incident in which the Los Angeles Police Department shut down a party with mostly black students near campus and arrested six students. Activists dubbed their cause the #USChangeMovement, but unfortunately, this movement, like many others, has seen very little change  and has begun to lose its steam.
But USChange cannot become another mere memory such as Occupy Wall Street or Kony 2012 with its hashtag buried in some Twitter graveyard. The pioneers of USChange should sit down and bring greater clarity and focus to the path of the movement.
On May 6, more than 100 students gathered around Tommy Trojan to protest the actions of the LAPD during a Saturday night party. The face-to-face meeting conducted with police officers on May 8 drew more than 750 people, with many waiting outside.
But what has happened since? Some media sources continue to chatter over the fate of the six students arrested. Talks between students and authorities have occurred in order to facilitate discussions about patterns of abuse at the hands of those who are attempting to protect us.
But USChange is falling off the radar. With such an important purpose — to eradicate prejudice from Los Angeles — this movement cannot afford to fade away now.
Today, USChange boasts 1,809 members on its Facebook group, which serves as a forum for discussion about the incident. The page, however, has started to lose its tenacity — fewer and fewer posts are seen each day.
The page credits ’13 alumna Rikiesha Pierce for spearheading the movement. Pierce has served as an incredible face of the cause by patiently answering press questions and uniting a community in a time of distress with her inspiring words.
“Now we have the opportunity to begin a dialogue about the realities of racial profiling and the university’s role in providing a safe environment for its students,” Pierce told the Summer Trojan. “It’s critical to ensure that these students are exonerated of any charges and that law enforcement is held accountable for the actions of their officers.”
Whether or not the charges against the USC Six are dropped, the larger issues of racism and police brutality in the community remain. Allowing abuse to persist might open the door for a sequel to the 1992 L.A. riots. It is time to devise a new strategy.
A Facebook group isn’t enough to create the substantial impact. Bringing awareness to such issues of racism requires nonviolent demonstrations that range from letter-writing campaigns to meetings with congressional officials.
Steps can start small — such as reviving USChange’s social media platforms — and snowball into larger actions such as creating a task force to monitor daily progress.
USChange should develop a fully functional website that is constantly updated with enriching information. Causes such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving have found a way to turn singular purposes into full-fledged organizations — these movements could serve as inspiration. Building an on-campus club could also be another viable option because real gains require an organized structure of monthly meetings and minutes.
Created in a time of need, USChange must go on for the benefit of future generations until the day that the job is done.
 
Rini Sampath is a sophomore majoring in international relations (global business).
One week ago I posted a brief comment to this article that met all posting guidelines. For the past 7 days it has been “awaiting moderation”. :Please advise why the extraordinary delay and who the person or pesons are who are moderating.
Students are to be commended for working to create a safe environment at USC. A critical opportunity was squandered this school year when a student organization invited a “sketch” rave promoter to the heart of campus. The promoter opened a closed student party to the community with highly visible tweets which surely were known to the sponsoring student group and other students. 
The students’ response was apparently to do nothing. No attempt to inform the administration, cancel the event, admonish the promoter. The result… crowds on campus, a shooting, potential physical harm to students and harm to USC’s reputation. 
Is it possible this shooting incident in the heart of campus contributed to campus security and LAPD expressing concern with a seemingly similar crowded party? Is it possible campus police and LAPD were doing just what USChange is asking for…protection of students?
USC has a notable reputation as a party school and with recent violence a somewhat dangerous one. A permissive attitude by the outgoing Director of Student Affairs and presumably his outgoing Assistant Director may well have reinforced a sense of entitlement and lack of accountability for behavior that is not tolerated in the “real world”. If so, be thankful for this “wake up call” and try to learn from it.
I simply raise these thoughts for consideration. Perhaps this was racial profiling by LAPD, but perhaps LAPD was doing their job and doing it very well in light of USC’s recent history.
How many of these so called “activists” have gone to black hoods and demanded that young black men stop stealing and committing often  violent crimes around the campus and in city in general.. ZERO.. It’s all about “racism”.. You have to face the fact the a huge majority of these crimes around the campus is being committed by colored people and the police isn’t profiling anything or anyone.. it’s not like there is white people around here and they say oh yeah he is white we won’t touch him but we ‘ll go after the colored…
Yeah, good luck with that. The very notion that you just judged “change” by how many people took 2 seconds to click “like” on a facebook group shows that you have no idea what it takes to actually implement change. Further, these types of groups ultimately tend to divide people rather than unite them and, in a fit of irony, they ultimately serve to propagate the very racial divides they claim to be against.

On June 7, John Zawahri killed five people and injured five more at Santa Monica College.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
As investigators and psychologists attempt to dig up details of the perpetrator’s life in a quest to find what drove such a heinous act of aggression, their investigation will most likely reveal a familiar pattern: the suspect had a history of abusing children or being abused as a child and the debate on gun control will pick up where it left off.
It’s a relatively new area of study, but some neuroscientists have suggested another factor that causes killers’ violent ways — that the motive of a killer could actually be embedded in his or her genes.
This might shed some light on the biological triggers behind the killer and answer the question of why people kill to begin with. Society needs to take advantage of today’s cutting-edge science to research the role that genetics play in committing violent acts because being more knowledgeable about this issue could potentially prevent the deaths of innocent people. People often fail to realize that it’s not just about the weapon or the upbringing. Having a gun does not make a person kill, and lacking a gun will not prevent a person from killing; abused children don’t always abuse in return, and children who grew up in a loving family sometimes end up on death row.
James Fallon, a professor of neurobiology at the University of California, Irvine, has spent the last two decades researching the brains of convicted killers to figure out how  killers’ brains are anatomically different. He studies subjects from a neurological and genetic vantage point and has come to the conclusion that there is a tangible and measurable difference in the brains of those are considered normal and healthy and those with a genetic predisposition to take lives.
Killers have less-active orbital cortices, which are involved in decision-making and ethical behaviors. In addition to abnormal brain structure, a certain version of the MAO-A gene, otherwise known as the “warrior gene,” is linked to people who show excessive or uncontrolled violence, according to NPR.
Fallon also comes from a family with a history of violence, with about eight relatives who were alleged killers. He himself possesses the “killer” variant of the MAO-A gene that he identified as being linked to aggression.
Fortunately, Fallon’s “killer gene” has not manifested itself in the form of serious aggression. What’s certain is that some people are biologically more inclined to kill, but the link between genetics and actual violent acts remains unclear.
Jeffrey Landrigan, a convicted killer executed in 2010, was adopted and raised by a highly educated, financially stable and loving family. He murdered two people and while on death row, as fate would have it, discovered his biological father was also on death row in a different state, convicted of murder. Landrigan later found out that his grandfather was also a violent criminal, according to Business Insider.
Nearly a dozen studies show that adopted children with biological parents who were criminals are more likely to commit crimes, regardless of how they were raised. Landrigan’s case is one of many that illustrate the powerful role of genetics in defining aggression, an idea discussed by criminologist Adrian Raine in his book The Anatomy of Violence.
In the United States, there are only two major scientists who study this subject, and the research is sparse not only because of its nascent nature but also because people don’t want to believe that they are defined by their DNA.
Killers won’t be able to blame everything on their DNA, and there are certainly people in prison who aren’t biologically inclined to kill. But even if there’s the slightest possibility that killers have an innate impulse that push them to commit their actions, society has a responsibility to do more research.
Killers are still responsible for their own actions, as we all are, but as human beings, they deserve to at least know that they were dealt a bad hand so that they can find the help they need to overcome their genetic inclinations.

USC experienced some roster turnover this week that benefitted the squad’s defense but depleted the depth of what is considered by many to be the Trojans’ most talent-laden position.
On Saturday, USC confirmed that freshman receiver Steven Mitchell would miss the upcoming season after tearing ligaments in his right knee while attending a voluntary throwing session.
Lindsey Thiry of Scout.com reported that Mitchell was running a deep route when he planted his right leg in the newly installed turf at Cromwell Field to turn around and make a catch. His knee immediately buckled and twisted, reportedly causing Mitchell to scream in pain as freshman quarterback Max Browne fetched the training staff, who were absent because of an NCAA rule that prohibits staff from attending voluntary workouts.
Mitchell is the second USC receiver to suffer a season-ending knee injury in the last two months, along with junior George Farmer.
Listed at 5’10” and 180 pounds, Mitchell was expected to provide speed over the middle as a slot receiver to complement junior superstar Marqise Lee and promising sophomore Nelson Agholor, who are expected to start at the outside flanker positions.
While the Trojans still have Lee and Agholor to headline their flanker core, the shorthanded unit now comprises only five scholarship players.
Freshman Darreus Rogers, redshirt senior De’Von Flourney and junior Victor Blackwell will compete for increased playing time to round out a receiving corps suddenly short on bodies. The trio combined for just one catch last season.

Though not yet official, the Trojans appear poised to receive commitments from two highly rated transfers, albeit two players who won’t be allowed to play until the fall of 2014, per NCAA transfer rules.
The recruiting trail of incoming Florida State linebacker Matthew Thomas, ESPN’s top-rated linebacker in the class of 2013, took another turn on Monday night when his father said his son wanted to go to USC, according to ESPN’s Joe Schad.
Thomas, ranked sixth overall by ESPN, has publicly said since February that initially committing to the Seminoles was a mistake, influenced by his mother’s refusal to sign her son’s letter of intent to USC.
In May, Thomas asked Florida State to release him from his commitment, but the school has said in statements that it will refuse the request. If Thomas follows through on a transfer to USC, he must give up a season of eligibility and start his college football career in 2014.
Former Texas Tech defensive tackle Delvon Simmons, a five-star member of the class of 2011, announced on his Twitter account last week that he’d be transferring to Troy. Simmons accrued 27 tackles, six tackles for loss and two sacks while starting all 13 games for the Red Raiders last season.
Simmons chose UNC out of high school but was released from his commitment to the Tar Heels because of sanctions resulting from recruiting violations made by former coach Butch Davis.
Simmons, a Pennsylvania native, had been linked to Pittsburgh and Penn State and visited Miami before settling on USC. He could pair up with sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams, who collected 64 tackles, 13.5 tackles for loss and eight sacks at tackle last year, in 2014 to form a fearsome duo on the defensive line for the Trojans.
—
Eddie Vanderdoes, a five-star defensive lineman from the class of 2013, announced last week that he will attend UCLA, his third commitment involving three schools in less than a year.
Vanderdoes originally committed to the Trojans last July before rescinding his commitment amid USC’s disastrous season. The Auburn, Calif. native ended up picking Notre Dame on Signing Day before mysteriously recanting once again.
Like Thomas, Vanderdoes will have to sit out the 2013 season, because Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said he will not release the defensive tackle from his letter of intent in order to “protect the integrity of [Notre Dame].”

Two USC baseball players were taken in the Major League Baseball draft conducted late last week. Junior infielder James Roberts was drafted in the 15th round by the Cleveland Indians with the 441st overall pick, and senior second baseman Adam Landecker was drafted in the 21st round by the Pittsburgh Pirates with the 629th overall selection.
Professional hitter · Senior second baseman Adam Landecker led USC with a .351 batting average and drove in 25 runs in 2013. – Daily Trojan file photo
Roberts was drafted in the 42nd round out of high school in 2010, and although he has a year of eligibility left at USC, it is unlikely he will return to school. Roberts hit .320 for USC while moving to third base midway through the season. He lead the team in both home runs (4) and RBI (28), and finished the year with a .429 slugging percentage and .379 on-base percentage.
Landecker made All-Pac-12 honorable mention for his performance this year, leading the Trojans with a .351 batting average and finishing with 25 RBI, .480 slugging percentage and .401 on-base percentage, earning the nickname “Captain Clutch” for his timely hitting throughout the year.
For USC, however, the bigger news came out of the potential commits that were drafted. First baseman Dominic Smith (Serra High School) was taken by the New York Mets with the 11th overall pick in the first round. Shortstop J.P. Crawford (Lakewood High School) went to the Phillies with the 16th overall selection in the first round. While both had committed to play at USC if they went to college, it is highly unlikely that either will.
Third baseman Ryan McMahon (Mater Dei High School) went to the Colorado Rockies with the 42nd overall pick in the second round, and shortstop Riley Unroe (Mesa, Ariz., Desert Ridge High School) was also picked in the second round by the Tampa Bay Rays with the 60th overall pick. Both will have to decide whether to sign with their respective pro teams or head to USC for the three years that would be required of them should they not sign directly out of high school.
Two more USC commits were also picked: first baseman Rowdy Tellez (Elk Grove High School) and catcher Jeremy Martinez (Mater Dei). Tellez was expected to be picked in the first few rounds but inexplicably fell all the way to the 30th round, where he was picked up by the Toronto Blue Jays. While not as highly touted as Tellez, Martinez also fell well below his expected slot, going in the 37th round to the Toronto Blue Jays. With their dramatic drops, both can be expected on campus next fall.
James Roberts needs to improve his fielding some more. His throwing is not accurate especially in clutch
situation of a game. Can’t blame a player who doesn’t want to return to a program immersed in mediocrity
for the last eight years.
Jeremy Martinez went to the Cubs not the Blue Jays.  Either way it’s unlikely he’ll sign.

Led by the outstanding performances of sprinters Bryshon Nellum and Aaron Brown, the USC men’s track and field team placed fifth with its most points since 1977 at the 2013 NCAA Track and Field Championships, hosted by Oregon on June 8. The USC women’s team would tie for 21st in the team scoring after their 4×100 meter relay team places seventh to pocket the team 12 points.
Bright future · After sustaining a gunshot wound in his left leg in the fall of 2009, Bryshon Nellum battled back to win a silver medal in the 1600m relay at the 2012 London Olympic Games and looks ahead to competing in 2016. – Kirby Lee | USC Sports Information
 
On a lighter note, USC director of Track and Field Ron Allice announced his retirement following the meet, ending his successful 19-year run at the helm of the USC track and field program. His retirement is effective at the end of this month.
“It’s a good way to go out,” Allice said. “As I tell people all the time, in coaching, you have to figure out when it looks like you’re leading a parade not being chased [out] by a mob. I can’t say enough about the staff. I can’t say enough about the athletes. They performed. Everybody took care of business and that’s what you come here to do.”
Prior to the final day of competition, Nellum won the 400, senior Reggie Wyatt won the 400 hurdles, and Brown took fifth in the 100 to put USC tied with Texas for first (32 points) in the team competition going into the last day. This was quite the feat as the Trojans had five men entered in just seven events, while favorites like Texas A&M and Arkansas had athletes participating in 20 events. This small but mighty Trojan team brought back memories of the 1943 NCAA title team, which won the championship with only four athletes.
“It was a really special day for us all across the board,” Allice said. “I don’t think anyone else lit it up like us. We’ve been on fire. I’m walking about three feet off the ground right now. This is such a tough meet, and to do what we are doing is really special.”
All USC runners came out at their best, as each athlete ran a personal best in their races. Wyatt was the first Trojan male to do so, as he won the men’s 400 IH NCAA title with a personal record of 48.58 seconds With the win, Wyatt moved from fifth to third on USC’s all-time list in the event and became the first Trojan to win the event since two-time Olympic gold medalist Felix Sanchez won in 2000.
“It was my last collegiate race and I wanted to leave it all on the track,” Wyatt said. “I knew this was it. I felt like this was for all the marbles, what I’ve been training for my whole career.”
Next, Brown would go on to a personal record of 10.01 in the men’s 100 final. Brown’s 10.01 time was the fastest-ever in the event by a Trojan at the NCAA championships and he became the first USC runner to score in the 100 dash since Ahmad Rashad placed second in 2009.
Finally, Nellum gave Hayward Field a treat, winning the men’s 400 dash with a personal record of 44.73. Nellum’s time was the fourth-fastest ever by a Trojan in the finals.
“The race felt good,” Nellum said. “I controlled the first 200, and I made my move and came home. Coming off the curve coming home, I used my form and finished strong. I just had to run my own race, stay comfortable and finish strong. It’s a beautiful feeling. This was one of my goals and the reason I came back for my sixth year — to win a national championship. I was able to come back and win which is just what I came back for.”
In the final event of his college career, Nellum was competing to become only the third person ever to win both the men’s 200 and 400 dashes, but unfortunately,  placed third with a wind-aided time of 20.27.
“For my college career, it painted a perfect picture,” Nellum said. “Coming from all my injuries and having that long journey, this was a happy ending, winning the national title in the 400 and finishing top three in the 200. Overall I’ve had a wonderful career at SC.”
Brown ran alongside Nellum in the 200 dash and placed fifth, making him and Nellum the first pair of Trojans to score in the event in the same season since 1978.
“I feel blessed, honestly,” Brown said. “I left it all on the line just like I wanted to. After all four races I felt good about all of them. Bryshon and I came out here and got top five. Can’t complain at all. Our team had five people, while A&M and Florida had 15 or 20. We’re kind of like 300 competing against this huge number of people and we did our best.”
With the completion of the NCAA championships, the USC track and field program will now enter the offseason and commence its search for a new director.
