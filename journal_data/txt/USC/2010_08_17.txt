USC now ranks as No. 23 on the U.S. News and World Report rankings of national universities released Tuesday, up from its ranking as No. 26 last year.
USC has risen 28 spots since 1991, when former President Steven B. Sample began his 19-year tenure as leader of the private university. USC is tied with Carnegie Mellon for the 23rd spot.
“USC’s rise in academic quality over the past two decades has been unprecedented, and this year’s rankings help confirm this,” said President C. L. Max Nikias in an interview with USC News. “But our goal is to continue our momentum — and even to escalate it — in order to make this one of the most productive and influential universities in an epoch of global change.”
The university currently ranks in between the University of California-Berkeley (No. 22) and the University of California-Los Angeles (No. 25)
Based on input from university leaders, admissions directors and high school counselors, the rankings report is released annually to indicate quality comparisons of universities across the nation.
The USC Marshall School of Business was also ranked as No. 10 nationally in professional schools and No. 4 in entrepreneurship.
Hey APJ,
Thanks for the response.  The thing is, I didn’t miss the point.  Your response was exactly my point.  Stanford had a relatively singular founding:  starting with an 8,000+ acre donation of land, then later in its history receives billions in endowments from the likes of Hewlett and Packard.  If USC, UCLA and Cal culled the top half of their respective student bodies and got rid of the bottom half (and had the endowment size of Stanford), it would not be surprising if the 3 schools moved up tremendously the rankings.  A school like Stanford can entice a lot of top students by offering full scholarships, where as the others don’t quite have the resources for that.  Hence, my conclusion that given the circumstances, USC, UCLA and Berkeley should be proud of their achievements.  Fight On!
Hey JPA, you and “we got in” are missing the point. Stanford, the Ivies, MIT, Caltech and schools of this caliber keep their population low so to perpetuate exclusivity. Besides, these aforementioned schools reject students who graduate top of their senior class; score near-perfect SATs; spread themselves thin with extracurriculars, etc. 
Oh yeah, Stanford and the Ivies got the highest concentration of billionaire alumni hence the far greater endowments…you know, Bill Gates, Silcon Valley tech magnates, the founder of Facebook, etc.?
Hey “We Got In”,
Let’s see Stanford double its student body to the sizes of USC, UCLA and Berkeley, and keep its current ranking intact.  Kudos to USC, UCLA and Berkeley for their high rankings with an endowment much smaller than Stanford’s and with roughly twice the student body.  Keep up the good work.
Interestingly the article mentions the rankings of Cal and UCLA, but fails the mention the continually high rankings for the premiere university of the west…. Stanford University.

The USC men’s tennis team has made a tradition of winning — more specifically, winning championships.
And coach Peter Smith is looking to keep it that way.
“Having won the NCAAs two times in a row, I don’t think changes anything we do,” Smith said. “Winning championships is nothing new for USC athletes.  That is the expectation we have every year.”
So, as the new season commences, the preparations and expectations for the defending 2009 and 2010 NCAA champions are the same as they have always been, despite a new volley of players.
To account for the loss of seniors Robert Farah — the reigning ITA Player of Year — and Jason McNaughton, the Trojans will introduce three new freshmen to the team for 2010.
Raymond Sarmiento, a Fontana, Calif. native who was rated second nationally in his recruiting class, Santa Barbara, Calif. native Michael Grant and Corey Smith from Point Loma, Calif., the coach’s nephew, will round out the side.
Veteran Steve Johnson thinks that the new blood, combined with the experience of the returning players, will allow USC to continue their streak of success.
“Those are certainly tough shoes to fill, but we have guys from last year coming back ready to step up, and hopefully a few of the new guys coming in will come in and bring a lot to the table,” he said.

But starting the school year does not mean leaving behind memorable days. During the coming months, Los Angeles will continue to serve as a place to find new experiences — if now on the weekends.
Head over to the Chinatown Summer Nights, a program held every Saturday in August. Presented by various organizations — including the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California and the Los Angeles Chinatown Corporation — the event takes place at the West and Central Plazas of Chinatown, and, most importantly, admission is absolutely free.
The next two events — on Saturday, Aug. 21 and Aug. 28 — will run from 5 p.m. to midnight. Each Saturday has its own theme, and this coming Saturday’s is “harmony,” featuring family workshops and cooking demos. To meet the program’s growing popularity, each Saturday brings in various food trucks for attendees to sample until 10 p.m. or midnight — depending on the plaza. This Saturday will also feature a martial arts workshop and a set by KCRW DJ Jeremy Sole.
Aug. 28 closes out the event and focuses on the theme of “longevity.” The day will include the same workshops, and Latin dance instructor Laura Canellias will replace the martial arts display, for which KCRW DJ Aaron Byrd will supply music.
Patrons can also sample the many restaurants in the area, for which the Chinatown Summer Nights website offers a variety of discounts. For coupons, parking information and the event schedule, visit the official website at: www.chinatownsummernights.com.

If it is true that success is bred from stability, Pat Haden — in his short time as USC’s new athletic director — is going a long way toward repaving that road for a program once accustomed to accomplishments on the highest levels.
Fresh face - Frank Cruz will replace Chad Kreuter and serve as interim head coach. - Photo courtesy of uscsports.com 
His latest move wasn’t a head-scratcher, or the type of decision that will define his hopefully long-standing tenure at USC. Nonetheless, it was the right move — one his predecessor shied away from completing before his eventual departure.
On Aug. 9, with little media attention or pomp and circumstance, Haden relieved coach Chad Kreuter of his duties after four years of service at the helm of the Trojan baseball team.
“We thank Chad Kreuter for his four years of hard work and service, but this move was necessary to revitalize our program,” Haden said in a succinct statement released by the university. “USC is synonymous with college baseball. This is the most successful and tradition-laden program in the country. We’ve won twice as many College World Series titles as anybody. We need to get back to our championship ways.”
Kreuter’s campaign was largely marred by underwhelming performances and unfulfilled expectations to the tune of a 111-117 (.487) overall record and a 39-63 (.382) showing in the Pac-10 — where the Trojans haven’t finished in the top five in since 2005.
In addition to those résumé killers, USC, under Kreuter, failed to complete a single season with a winning record, the longest drought for the program since George Wheeler and Sam Crawford’s futile teams floundered between 1922 and 1924.
But even without the gaudy numbers or trips to Omaha, his quiet exit was not lost on several of his former players.
“I enjoyed playing for Coach Kreuter and have the utmost respect for him,” said senior second baseman Joe De Pinto. “I appreciate everything he taught me.”
The man slotted to replace the departed Kreuter on an interim basis for the 2011 season is Frank Cruz, an individual who knows all too well the championship mentality Haden is hoping the baseball program can restore.
While Cruz, 51, spent the last two seasons with USC as a volunteer assistant, his first stint with the program was as a full-time assistant under legendary coach Mike Gillespie. During Cruz’s initial stop with the Trojans from 1993 to 1996, the team accumulated a record of 169-86-1 and made four straight NCAA Tournament appearances.
“I think it was important for Mr. Haden to stay within the coaching staff for this upcoming season because [Cruz] knows what Trojan baseball is all about,” De Pinto said. “After talking to other players there is a new sense of excitement swirling around the clubhouse and we are all looking forward to a successful 2011 season.”
Cruz is no stranger to the managerial position, leading the Loyola Marymount Lions from 1997 to 2008. He was named “Recruiter of the Year” in 1997 by Collegiate Baseball, and compiled 329 victories in his 12 years in the West Coast Conference — eighth all-time in the conference’s history.
“This is a bittersweet time for me,” said Cruz in the statement. “I really enjoyed working for Chad Kreuter and I have the utmost respect for him. I hate to see him go. He put his heart and soul into coaching the USC baseball team.”
For Haden’s hand-picked interim manager to restore the heart and soul of a once celebrated program it will take more than a little patience as he takes over a team that has lacked the winning culture once synonymous with USC baseball.
Yet for Cruz — a seasoned manager in his own right — the challenge of lifting the Trojans from the basement of mediocrity is not a burden, but an opportunity.
“I want this program to succeed in every way possible,” Cruz said. “I will get to work immediately to continue to improve our program and I appreciate the opportunity given to me to do that.”

Many things in life come in sets of three — golf balls, for instance. Or the colors on a traffic light.
Saved - Junior goalkeeper Joel Dennerley anchors the staunch defense that has brought USC recent success. The Trojans have their sights set on a third consecutive national championship and No. 1 ranking. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
But when it comes to collegiate water polo, national championships do not typically follow that trend. Over the past quarter of a century, only one team has ever won three consecutive NCAA titles: California in 1991, 1992 and 1993.
This season, the USC men’s water polo team will aim to break from past precedent and win a third consecutive NCAA championship after similar success stories in the two years prior.
Yet it goes without saying that to do so is easier said than done.
Despite having arguably the top coach in the country in Jovan Vavic — who has led the Trojans to five national titles during his 17-year run with the program — and a roster full of talented underclassmen, USC must sustain the loss of 10 seniors, including Cutino Award-winner J.W. Krumpholz.
“It’s really big to lose that many seniors,” said junior two-meter Matt Burton. “Guys like [Shea] Buckner and J.W. were some of the best players in the country. So obviously, it’s huge when you lose guys like that.”
On top of its unusually high player turnover, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation slate won’t provide the Trojans with many breaks either. The schedule is once again composed of some of the toughest competitors in the nation — namely Stanford and UCLA, two teams that have not only won conference titles this past decade but national titles as well.
“MPSF play is going to be very tough as usual,” Vavic said. “There are going to be at least five-to-six teams in our conference that can win it.”
Yet, despite these challenges, optimism continues to flow from the waters at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
“We are a very young group, but a national championship is still our goal,” Vavic said after one of the team’s summer training sessions. “I think that out of all the teams I’ve had here, this is the best group in terms of having the desire and willingness to work. They’ll do whatever is needed to get better and compete.”
One of the primary reasons for Vavic’s confidence might be because of the return of three key juniors: Burton, driver Peter Kurzeka and goalkeeper Joel Dennerley. A year ago, Burton and Kurzeka tallied 17 and 29 goals respectively as part of one of the top offensive units in the nation.
Dennerley’s defense may have even been more impressive, as the Australian native totaled more than 200 saves and allowed just 4.8 goals per game in just his second year at USC. In turn, Vavic has gone on to give the 6’4” junior the highest of praise.
“Joel is the best goalie we’ve ever had. Period,” Vavic said.
With a wingspan of more than 6 feet 6 inches, and plenty of natural ability, it’s easy to see why Dennerley, who is also a member of the Australian national team, is receiving high praises. However, according to Vavic, it is not simply his talent that sets him apart from his peers.
“His biggest strength is that he’s extremely conscious and outstanding in his preparation,” Vavic said. “That really is what separates him. He really prepares. He knows the opponent. He knows where they shoot. He just does whatever he needs to do.”
While this season’s “big three” will surely be counted on to play significant minutes, they will also be asked to provide steady leadership.
“I really like the leadership of this team,” Vavic said. “Those three guys should be absolutely outstanding for us and be some of the best leaders we’ve ever had.”
But even with their leadership and natural abilities, if USC is to achieve its goal of a third consecutive national championship it will not be able to simply rely on three players alone. Instead, Vavic is emphasizing a more methodical approach, relying heavily on defense and counter-attacks instead of simply trying to outscore teams from the onset.
“We’re going to have to play a different style,” Vavic said. “In order for us to win this year, it’s going to have to be through more counterattacks and great defense. We’ll have to rely on [Dennerley] more than ever before. Some of the younger guys are really going to have to step up as well.”
Some of those inexperienced but talented players include sophomore two-meter Brian Boswell and sophomore drivers Stephen Siri, Michael Rosenthal and Forest Monroe. While each have shown the necessary skills to elicit praise from Vavic, they do lack the game experience that would normally make USC favorites to win the national championship once again.
Yet, the odds don’t appear to be very off-putting to the rest of the youthful Trojan bunch as it prepares for the upcoming 2010 campaign.
“We want to have the exact same success we’ve enjoyed the past two years,” Burton said. “We won’t settle for second, we won’t settle for third. That to us is failure.”

Though its completion is still decades away, USC’s Master Plan is one step closer to becoming a reality with the release of a draft environmental report that this summer.
Store owners - Matthew Kravitz works at his store, Dr. A.D. Kravitz Optometrists, at the University Village. He is one of many store owners who will be affected by USC’s Master Plan. - Ted Gerike | Daily Trojan  
The university’s Master Plan aims to revitalize the surrounding community around USC and make it a more residential campus over the next 25 to 30 years. The 4,000-page Environmental Impact Report — which is required for all major development projects in California — evaluates and reports any significant impact the Master Plan will have on the environment.
Kristina Raspe, associate senior vice president of real estate at USC, said the draft report is currently being circulated for public comment. The public hearings for the report will start at the end of this calendar year or at the beginning of 2011.
“The community has been incredibly supportive,” Raspe said. “There has been pressure on the university to build more housing so students will stop taking away community housing.”
The report studies about 20 to 30 environmental categories including air quality, water quality and traffic. The Los Angles City Council will decide whether to approve the Master Plan based on the impacts outlined in the report.
“Some of the categories may have no effect on the environment and some other categories may only have a short-term effect,” Raspe said. “When the EIR goes to the City Council for a vote, they will have to decide if the negative impacts in the EIR are outweighed by the benefits of the project.”
USC’s Master Plan includes a renovation of District 3, which includes the University Village, Cardinal Gardens and Century Apartments.
According to the Los Angeles Times, USC’s plan, which includes adding upscale retail stores and about 5,000 beds for students, will cost about $900 million.
Raspe said it has taken four years to truly develop the Master Plan because the university wanted to incorporate the input of every party involved — students, faculty, elected officials and the community.
Some students expressed concern that the plan might only cater to USC students and not serve the needs of the community surrounding campus — questions that have also been raised by others after hearing  USC’s plans for the area.
“If we replace the [U.V.] with trendy restaurants and shops, that would be a loss. I guess I would try to just have more of a variety of retailers and amenities,” said Michael Boisvert, a junior majoring in music performance.
Retailers have yet to be named, but Raspe said they will serve an assortment of socioeconomic backgrounds.
“We still need to work out who the retailers will be. Don’t forget that about 60 percent of our students are on some form of financial aid so the retail needs do overlap in that regard,” Raspe said.
The Master Plan will also bring a new full-service grocery store, drugstore, restaurant and cinema.
“It’s hard to balance what the community wants and what USC students would like to see in their community. I wouldn’t know how to do it,” said Albert Sung, a junior majoring in biological sciences.
For the past few decades, the university has focused on shedding the commuter campus label and trying to become more of a residential campus. Raspe said the Master Plan reflects this commitment.
“The process took four years because we realized it would be transformational,” Raspe said. “Although the construction process won’t be fun for any of us, the outcome is well worth it. We have really transformed ourselves from a commuting campus to a more residential one.”
Boisvert said the Master Plan will strengthen the university’s goal toward becoming a true residential campus.
“This isn’t the ’80s anymore — people can come and stay here and be safe,” he said. “And I think it’s good that we’re taking more steps to make sure people know that.”

Imagine selling businesses that have net profits upwards of $100 million. Pat Haden, USC’s new athletic director, did just that for 23 years. But as of Aug. 3, he put away his investment portfolio and grabbed a clipboard.
James Watson | Daily Trojan
Haden left a cushy high-rise equipped with secretaries, plasma screens and leather bound books with a view of hometown rival UCLA for another cushy office at USC — but one with a lot more clutter on its desk.
When President C.L. Max Nikias took office, he brought Haden, a former Trojan quarterback two-time academic All-American and Rhodes Scholar, on to fill one of the highest-profile positions in college athletics.
In a series of recent upheavals by USC’s administration, Haden replaced Mike Garrett, former USC running back, Heisman winner and athletic director of the last 17 years. Haden’s hire was a move that happened very quickly, yet was not without much deliberation.
“I had heard the rumor, time and time again,” said Chris Lewis, Haden’s partner in the private equity firm Riordan, Lewis & Haden. “But I wasn’t surprised that USC wanted him. I was surprised that he’d do it.”
Haden said he also surprised himself when he took the job. He rejected the offer a few times but after some careful thought, he liked the idea of a different kind of challenge than finance, a field he’s been in for much of his career.
“There are a lot of good people that do have [athletic administrative] experience, but this university is in some respects a business, and he has that experience covered,” said John McKay, Jr., USC’s new associate athletic director.
Experience will be key for Haden. As athletic director, Haden assumes the reigns of a department shackled with sanctions from the NCAA, which said the university had “a lack of institutional control” over its athletic programs after concluding a four-year investigation in June. The men’s basketball and women’s tennis teams self-imposed penalties on themselves before the ruling and face no additional punishment, but the NCAA came down hard on the football program, primarily because of improper benefits received by former Trojan great Reggie Bush. The team lost 30 scholarships over the next three years and cannot compete in bowl games for the next two seasons.
The university is appealing the decision and hopes the second year ban will be lifted, McKay said.
McKay, who played with Haden on the football team, said he believes the athletic director sets the tone for the department, and Haden’s tone reiterated that of compliance.
“Winning is important to me, but winning ethically is a little more important,” Haden said.
Those around Haden, who is most recently known as a NBC commentator for Notre Dame football, said he should have no problem governing by compliance as his integrity stands out above any other quality.
“Pat will bring instant credibility,” Lewis said. “People will say, ‘Here’s a guy that will follow the rules,’ and there won’t be any question about it.”
Haden has always been about rules. He received his law degree at Loyola Law School in 1982, after playing for the Los Angeles Rams from 1976 to 1981. A few years later, he met former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan, who asked Haden to be a member of his law firm. Within the spans of a few years, Haden went from NFL quarterback to a law degree-holding member of a prominent law firm.
“He’s always had a lot of irons in the fire,” Lewis said.
Haden never thought one of those irons would lead him to the athletic director at his alma mater, but now that he’s here, he said he believes his leadership skills will help bring the athletic department up to speed.
“I told the direct staff that reports to me, ‘Hey, I’m new at this, but you need to let me know what your goals are, and I will do my best to help you get there,’” he said.
Despite his inexperience in athletic administration, Haden didn’t wait long to digest some of those goals and make his first major move.
Just more than a week into the job, Haden fired head baseball coach Chad Kreuter. His 111-117 (.487) overall record was subpar in Haden’s eyes.
“Chad’s a fine man, but at the end of the day, we didn’t win. We were last place in the Pac-10 [in 2010],” Haden said. “Chad had four years to turn it around, and he didn’t. Our baseball heritage is so strong; we won all four years when I was here. I grew up with our baseball being the best in the country.”
The Trojan baseball program has won 12 baseball national championships, twice that of any other university.
It just so happens that interim baseball coach Frank Cruz has served on the NCAA baseball rules committee for four years. But Haden insists that notch on Cruz’s résumé had nothing to do with his promotion.
“It wasn’t an afterthought, a pre-thought or a thought period,” Haden said. “Frank Cruz was the right man for the job at this point in the year.”
Haden’s baseball move reflects his dedication to increasing the focus on and support of sports that don’t have the same national recognition as football and basketball.
“I don’t want any athlete around here to think they’re second-class citizens to football,” Haden said. “That’s not the case at all.”
Immediate goals Haden has for student-athletes include providing a more fulfilling, wholesome and most of all, legal college experience.
“I don’t want to see our athletes locked up in Heritage Hall. I want to see our athletes at concerts, at plays,” Haden said.
Haden, who graduated magna cum laude from USC, said he plans to focus on closing the GPA and graduation gap between the general student population and student athletes.
But that doesn’t mean that Haden is just going to abandon putting a successful product on the field.
Although Haden said every meeting he starts with compliance, he doesn’t want a “compliance culture” to prevent athletics from flourishing.
“We must do what we have to do without dampening the competitive spirit. You don’t want to be so compliant that all you’re doing is saying ‘no’ to everything,” Haden said.
In order to be successful while staying within the lines, Haden is urging coaches to be selective in their recruiting.
“Lane Kiffin has to be really selective about the kind of kids he brings in; all the coaches need to be continually vigilant about our recruiting of quality kids,” he said.
He said he hopes the dark cloud on USC will one day evaporate, but realizes a lot rides on his shoulders.
“At the end of the day I’m going to be judged by graduating rates, winning championships and staying out of NCAA trouble,” he said.
Staying out of NCAA trouble will arguably be the toughest task. But removing Reggie Bush’s Heisman Trophy from Heritage Hall helped send a message, Haden said.
“While we want great athletes like Reggie Bush to come here, we’re going to win the right way,” Haden said. “We’re going to do our best not to allow our players to be corrupted.”
Haden’s longstanding reputation in the community of Los Angeles aims to bring a better image to the school, McKay said. Any future actions of the USC athletic department rest on this new administration’s reputation.
“We’ve been through these [tough times] before, and like a phoenix, we will always rise,” Haden said.

Don’t judge a book by its cover.
There might not be a more over-used cliché in the English language. Yet as the topsy-turvy story of Lane Kiffin — a football lifer turned high-profile coach — reaches its next chapter on the steps of the Coliseum, one look at his past doesn’t really tell you where this opportunist is headed.

It’s easy to label USC’s newest household name as an unproven and somewhat browbeaten coaching caricature. His career path has come full circle but has been anything but the status quo — defined not by playoff appearances and BCS bowl games, but by allegations, press conference antics and recruiting methodologies that would make a tabloid writer or gossip columnist blush.
During his initial sojourn at USC from 2001-2006, Kiffin, in his best jack-of-all trades role — as the wide receivers coach, passing coordinator and eventual offensive coordinator — helped build the foundation for the most prolific offense college football witnessed over the past decade. Although Heisman Trophies and BCS National Championships made for thrilling bullet points to add to his quickly evolving résumé, Kiffin benefitted greatly from the experience of growing under Carroll, while also proving that he represented more than a beneficiary of Carroll’s namesake. Kiffin’s influence became etched in the development of NFL talents like Steve Smith, Dwayne Jarrett, Mike Williams and Dominique Byrd.
“As an assistant coach the experience in my mind matched the extremely high level of success I had set out for,” Kiffin said. “My first NFL job I got to work around Tom Coughlin. And then being here for so long with Coach [Pete] Carroll — it was very exciting going through all of those championship runs.”
If the book on Kiffin had closed after his time at USC, the literature might not have been top-dollar, but enjoyable enough for a quick read. The same could not be said for his brief time in Oakland.
From the day Al Davis made him the youngest head coach in NFL history at age 31 by introducing him as “Lance,” to the underwhelming 5-15 record he accumulated, to his painfully awkward pink slip in September 2008, to the still-ongoing battle regarding his buyout plan, the NFL proved to be an experience unworthy of too much ink in the 35-year-old’s coaching memoirs.
“There were so many things going on there, not only being so young and a head coach in the NFL, but being in such a unique place that has a lot of battles you have to go through,” Kiffin said. “It really has prepared me for when things don’t go right or when you have to deal with adversity.”
And if Kiffin’s book ever needed a consistent theme, adversity would be a fitting place to start.
In 2009, when the Fresno State alumnus accepted the job to become the 21st football coach at the University of Tennessee, unbeknownst to the Rocky Top Faithful, the university’s selection to replace longtime fixture Phil Fulmer would not only fail to live up to the image of his predecessor, but would become one of the most hated men in university history.
On the surface, a 7-6 record in a powerhouse conference like the SEC, with a team as undisciplined and green as the Volunteers were last season, would normally be applauded by boosters and alumnus. But when a barely .500 team is led by a man who in 365 days quickly transformed from a play-caller to a nightly news headliner to a potential NCAA rule breaker, anxiety in Knoxville grew.
There was the back-and-forth banter with Florida coach Urban Meyer, the late-night arrests of key members of his team and accusations he made derogatory comments to a recruit about a rival school — and the list goes on. Kiffin was no longer perceived as a top-notch leader but as an arrogant rebel rouser — and that was before the night of Jan. 12.
We all remember the scene as Kiffin made the cross-country leap to become USC’s replacement after the surprising departure of Pete Carroll.
In Knoxville, there was the abrupt statement, the getaway car and the ensuing madness. Riots were started, mattresses were burned, rocks were defaced and the ugliness of fanaticism boiled over on the streets of the stunned and heartbroken town.
More than eight months have passed since then, and the Minnesota native is certain he made the right decision. He also says he is proud of the time he spent as Tennessee’s coach.
“I think your job as a head coach when you come in is to improve your roster and make sure your players are doing a great job academically and we did both of those, so I feel good about that,” Kiffin said. “I don’t feel good about the timing, but I couldn’t really control that. When your dream job becomes available and is offered to you, sometimes everything doesn’t turn out perfectly.”
While even the most cynical of Kiffin’s doubters would have a hard time criticizing why he made the move from Tennessee to Los Angeles, the newest chapter in what has become a can’t-put-the-book-down type of read hasn’t been all California dreaming.
Throw in a NCAA-instituted two-year bowl ban and the loss of potentially 30 scholarships for institutional instability during the reign of Mike Garrett, and the “dream job” Kiffin took amid mass hysteria suddenly becomes a challenge of unforeseen proportions for a man who has a meager 12-21 lifetime coaching record.
But though media pundits and talking heads portray the coach as a cocky and conceited self-promoter, Kiffin barely bats an eye at the criticism, believing that this job presents him with a career-defining opportunity.
“This is a completely different job than I have had before, and if you study it or pay attention to it, you will see a very different approach,” Kiffin said. “We need to graduate players and coach our players really well and recruit really well, and that’s it. We don’t need to do anything outside of that.”
While Kiffin has made news outside of this self-imposed realm of simplicity in recent weeks — both for the nature in which he recruited former Tennessee Titans running backs coach Kennedy Pola for the team’s offensive coordinator position, and for reports that the NCAA will increase its probe regarding recruiting violations that took place during his time with the Volunteers — USC’s coach seems unmoved by the hoopla.
Write what you want about him, convict him in the court of public opinion or publish editorials bashing him for why he does what he does. Just don’t expect a reaction.
“People ask me all the time, ‘How you deal with this’, or ‘This just happened, aren’t you just consumed by it all, aren’t you overwhelmed?’” Kiffin said. “And I’m really not. I take it one day at a time, and just do what I do, which is coach. I just go to work, and have always enjoyed my job. And obviously when you are at your dream place for the profession that you love, you enjoy it even more. I love every second of every day, and every day walking in here regardless of what is going on.”
Although the initial chapters in his story might depict a brazen figure that seems comfortable masking his inabilities with trash talk and unconventional ideology, Kiffin is undoubtedly comfortable in his own skin, and doesn’t believe his past will threaten a program looking to regain its glory.
“Kids since the fourth grade have watched USC play in BCS games every single year until last year, which is better than any marketing any person or coach could dream up,” Kiffin said.
For those out there hoping Kiffin’s final pages will be full of angst and more tumultuous turns, don’t go looking for that lame-duck status to be thrust upon him just yet. Although former USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett might have been the hand that plucked him from Knoxville, USC’s coach has supporters in all the right places.
“I know from multiple conversations with both of them [Athletic Director Pat Haden and President C.L. Max Nikias], they are extremely behind our program and our staff,” Kiffin said. “Usually for a head coach, when an athletic director changes or a new president comes in who didn’t hire him, it can be a scary situation. But this is very unique, because Max having been here for years and Pat being involved for years and not coming from another A.D. job where maybe he has his own guy, I have already felt their support.”
Although support has poured in from the upstairs corridors of Heritage Hall, for this story to go from nightmarish to Hollywood-esque, it will take uncommon undertakings on the part of Kiffin in his first year: specifically, the task of motivating high-caliber athletes to compete, despite the fact there is no holy grail to obtain.
But again, Kiffin isn’t hitting the panic button as the season closes in on the Trojans.
“I just don’t think [USC football players] go to practice or to a seven-on-seven and say, ‘Boy if I do well today I am going to get to the Rose Bowl,’” Kiffin said. “Maybe some other places where players are motivated differently, that could be more of an issue. I don’t foresee that here.”
For now, the uncertainty of the days that lie ahead will surely captivate a university, a community and a nation of naysayers who question whether this man is the right fit for one of the most sought-after positions in sports — a position that the coach believes the last 1,000 days has more than aptly prepared him for.
“I don’t feel there is a job in America in this profession that I would feel too much weight on,” Kiffin said. “Think about the last three years and what I have been through.”
Where will the next three years take this whirlwind tale?
Keep reading. Regardless of what you think you know about Lane Kiffin based on his cover, the chapters soon to come will surely surprise you.

Although the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics is saying goodbye to its director this fall, officials say the institute’s mission to facilitate student political discourse will continue under a new interim director.
Politics - Under Dan Schnur, the Unruh Institute focused on engaging students in political discourse through interactive discussions. - Daily Trojan file photo
Dan Schnur, the director of the institute since 2008, will take a leave of absence from the university this fall to serve as the chairman of California’s Political Practices Commission, a bipartisan independent body that serves as the chief political watch dog group for the state.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced Schnur’s appointment on June 1.
“The people of California deserve a political environment that is fair and puts their needs first,” Schwarzenegger said in a press release. “Dan Schnur has spent years teaching and advocating for equality and transparency in California politics and I am grateful that he will continue his service to our state in this new role.”
Having served on four presidential campaigns, the most recent of which was in 2000 as the director of communication for presidential hopeful and Arizona Sen. John McCain, Schnur said one of the most important lessons he has learned is that anyone can have political influence.
“I was 20 when I joined my first presidential campaign,” Schnur said. “I drove from my home in Wisconsin to Washington, D.C. The most important thing I have learned on the campaign trail is that even a young person can make a real difference if they decide to get involved.”
Schnur has worked to get young people engaged in the political process at USC. He has taught a number of classes at the university in political science and journalism, and played a major role in the organization of the USC College/Los Angeles Times poll.
“The polls received national and international attention,” Schnur said. “But to me, the most important part is giving the students an opportunity to experience how political opinion and polling is accomplished.”
Part of polling, Schnur said, is bringing students into political discussions. One of the Unruh Institute’s more visible events, the weekly “Students Talk Back” luncheons, give students the chance to participate in conversations with current political figures.
The Daily Trojan co-sponsors the luncheons, which also include speakers from campus political organizations.
“Our focus is on providing quality experiences for students to engage with politics,” said Kerstyn Olson, the deputy director for the institute. “We supplement the USC course experience by creating programs for students to engage in outside the classroom.”
Ann Crigler, professor and chair of USC’s department of political science, will serve as acting director for the institute during Schnur’s absence this semester.
Crigler said the institute has several events planned for the semester — and elections — ahead.
“We will be hosting a combination of things this semester, such as a series of programs on the elections that will be important to get students to know what’s going on,” she said.
With the goal of bringing students together in the political realm through discourse and hands-on experience, those involved in the Unruh Institute said it is a resource for all students.
“Steve Jobs of Apple talks about making a dent in the universe,” Schnur said. “The single best way for anybody to do this is through public service. If you are serious about making your city or country or world a better place to live, the place to do it is working on behalf of a candidate or cause you believe in.”

There’s another new face within the USC administration this fall — Roski School of Fine Arts Dean Rochelle Steiner.

Steiner, who began her tenure as dean on Aug. 1, is  a well-regarded curator and writer in the world of contemporary art. She has international experience working with artists and museums, and said she hopes to bring this to USC.
“I think it is important to grow this school and to create a great center for creativity, production and collaboration,” Steiner said.
Originally from Los Angeles, Steiner served as the chief curator at the Serpentine Gallery in London, worked as the director of the Public Art Fund in New York and most recently served as a consultant for the Miami Art Museum. She has been a key player in the contemporary art world for more than 15 years.
Steiner received her Ph.D. in visual and cultural studies from the University of Rochester in New York, and has curated more than 60 exhibitions during her career.
It is through her extensive work in the art world, Steiner said, that she hopes to bring connections and opportunities for students in Los Angeles.
“Based on my past, I have great relationships with museums and curators in L.A. and across the country,” she said.
Steiner said she has always enjoyed working with artists and is very excited about making the transition to working with student artists at Roski.
“I do think that, in a way, being the dean of the school is about looking at the future talent,” Steiner said.
Steiner said she will begin by meeting with the school’s faculty and analyzing how they can effectively increase the role of Roski on campus.
Though she has many goals for expanding the school, Steiner said her ultimate goal is to make Roski a premier art school in Los Angeles.
“Los Angeles is a great city for artists and art schools,” she said.
Former Dean Ruth Weisberg served for 15 years as the head of Roski. She stepped down last September to return to teaching and focus on her own art.
After taking a one-year sabbatical, Weisberg will return to Roski to teach life drawing, her artistic specialty.
Under Weisberg’s leadership, the school became extremely successful, expanded both the student body and faculty positions and brought in donations — including the $23 million gift from Gayle and Edward Roski, which resulted in renaming the school.
“We’ve really expanded the reputation of the school,” Weisberg said. “It’s been extremely satisfying.”
Weisberg said she is excited that Steiner decided to bring her artistic expertise to USC.
“I think she is a terrific choice and she will expand my work and my vision while adding many elements of her own,” Weisberg said.
USC Thornton School of Music Dean Robert Cutietta served as the chair of the search committee for the new dean, and said the committee chose Steiner because she embodied many of the traits seen in successful deans.
“What impressed us with Dean Steiner was that she brought to our conversations a true artistic spirit but also balanced that with the deep understanding of how that could interact with the educational mission of USC,” Cutietta wrote in an e-mail.
Karen Koblitz, full-time lecturer and area head of ceramics at Roski, said she believes having Steiner is a great opportunity for the school.
“I think that she will bring fresh ideas to the school and be able to push it in new directions,” Koblitz said.
Shannon Ebner, assistant professor of fine arts practice and area head of photography at Roski, agrees that Steiner will be able to confidently move the school forward.
“Rochelle Steiner is an excellent choice for Roski because she has a long history of working closely with artists as both a curator and an arts administrator,” Ebner wrote in an e-mail. “She knows how to collaborate in ways that are both conceptually rigorous and pragmatically efficient.”

For USC students, a night out at a Los Angeles club usually involves a great deal of planning, driving and, of course, an ID that says they are of age.  But at Tommy’s Place, the new concert venue located in the basement of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, students of all ages can enjoy live bands, DJs and other events in a nightclub atmosphere, without the hassle.
High tech - The new Tommy’s Place will showcase student bands as well as DJs to create a new entertainment source for USC students. - James Watson | Daily Trojan
Opening its doors to the public during the first week of classes, Tommy’s Place will serve as a student lounge by day — filled with tables and chairs where students can do homework or have lunch — and a club by night, open until midnight Sunday through Thursday and 2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday.  Traditions Restaurant, formerly located in The Lot, has been rebuilt next to Tommy’s Place and will serve as the venue’s source of food and drinks.
According to Brandon Operchuck, the director of performance venues at USC, the idea for Tommy’s Place originated five years ago, when the new campus center was in the planning stage.
“There was this concept of having a kind of lounge, club environment that would give students a place to go on campus without having to hop in their cars and go to Hollywood,” Operchuck said.  “They could walk straight to or from their dorm to a venue.”
Rae Reilly, the venue’s production manager, said that student safety was a key factor in the creation of Tommy’s Place.
“That’s the main goal of us creating this venue — getting students to come here on a Saturday night instead of going off campus to some crazy party where they can get in trouble,” said Reilly, a senior majoring in music industry.
KXSC — formerly KSCR — and Spectrum will host the inaugural event at Tommy’s Place on Aug. 18, a DJ night featuring USC alumnus Daedelus.  On Aug. 27, Tommy’s Place Battle of the Bands will be, the first event actually produced by the venue.  Five student bands, including Kiven, The Beat Advocate, The Smiles, MEGG and Antonio Pontarelli, will compete for the grand prize, which will either be to open for a well-known band the next night, or to headline at a Tommy’s Place event at a later date.
“I’m really excited for what Tommy’s Place could do for student bands like us,” said sophomore Nate Howard, one of The Beat Advocate’s vocalists.  “With the new student center hype and location, I believe it will be a great place for student bands to showcase their talent.”
Although student bands will get priority when booking Tommy’s Place, outside bands will have the stage as well, Operchuck said. This will add to a variety of choices for USC students.
“I think that Tommy’s Place will be the most beneficial for student bands like mine if they bring in some acts with an established reputation and let student bands perform as the opening acts,” said Tyler Demorest, a senior majoring in music industry and the lead vocalist and guitarist of Kiven.
Aside from featuring bands and DJs, Tommy’s Place will host comedy shows, karaoke nights, pool tournaments and sport screenings. The venue is open to events of all kinds, Reilly said, especially when it comes to music.
“We want as many different genres of music as possible,” she said.  “We are listening to everyone’s demo before we book them.  It’s a great place to be exposed and the bands can sell merchandise.”
Although Tommy’s Place is the first venue of its kind on campus, it is not the only concert space. Both Reilly and Operchuck said that Tommy’s Place will not create competition for Ground Zero Performance Café. The two venues will work together to ensure that they are not hosting similar events on the same night.
“I think we’ve built a family of venues and each has its own characteristics,” Operchuck said.  “Tommy’s Place is attached to a bar, which brings a different vibe than being in a coffeehouse.”
Because alcohol will be served at Tommy’s Place, those who are 21 and older will receive wristbands upon entering and DPS will be patrolling, Reilly said.
Many students said they are excited that the venue, which holds about 200 people and does not charge for admission, will provide an alternative to the usual nighttime activities that take place on and around campus.
“They serve beer on discretionary dollars, which is always great motivation for students to come check out some good music” Demorest said.
Tommy’s Place has both a Facebook page and a Twitter account, which students can use to find out about upcoming events.  The beauty of Tommy’s Place, though, is its convenient location so that students need not plan ahead.
“I think it’ll be the place to be,”  Operchuck said.  “If it’s a Friday night and students are all hanging out in their dorms — they can just come down here and see who’s playing.”

Longevity is not easy in the music world. Oftentimes bands are torn apart by incessant touring schedules, pressure from the industry and living in close quarters with each other. Although break-ups are difficult for fans to handle, they also tend to be hard on the band members themselves.
Katrina MacGregor | Daily Trojan
Consequently, the power, emotion and thrill of playing music compels certain bands to give it another shot, a second go-around. The following bands now stand before their fans humbled by the break-up experience, ready to pick up where they left off.
Something Corporate
Formed in 1998 in Orange County, Calif., the band made a name for themselves by playing rock music supplemented by precise piano arrangements. Andrew McMahon (vocals/piano), Josh Partington (guitar), Kevin Page (bass) and Brian Ireland (drums) found success in their early years and reached a peak in 2002 when they released their major label debut, Leaving Through the Window.
Exhausted by touring and feeling like the members had lost their individual identities, the members of Something Corporate went on hiatus in 2005. Now, Something Corporate is ready to head out on its official reunion tour this August, which will stop in Anaheim at The Grove on Aug. 27 and at Club Nokia down the street on Aug. 28.
Face to Face 
This punk rock band from Victorville, Calif. began its career in 1991. By 1994, it broke into the mainstream with the release of their second album, Big Choice, which featured the hit song, “Disconnected.”
Citing musical differences, the band announced its break-up in 2004 and followed it up with a full tour to say goodbye. Face to Face officially reunited in April of 2008 and spent this summer on the Vans Warped Tour. The band’s first album since the break-up will be released this fall and is called Laugh Now, Laugh Later.
Bush 
Gavin Rossdale and Nigel Pulsford formed this alternative rock band in London circa 1992. They achieved platinum status in 1994 but in 2001 they released Golden State, which sold less than 400,000 copies. Pulsford left the band soon after and was replaced by Chris Traynor. Bush officially disbanded in 2002, citing lack of record label support and declining sales as the major reasons.
Bush is slated to perform its first show in eight years at the Epicenter Festival on Sept. 25 in Fontana, Calif. The band will soon begin work on a new album, although founding member Nigel Pulsford will not be a part of the reunion.
Stone Temple Pilots
After five years of going their separate ways and starting their own lives, Scott Weiland (vocals), Robert DeLeo (bass), Dan Deleo (guitar) and Erik Kretz (drums) are back at it again.
Their self-titled album was produced separately, with the instrumentalists recording the music before sending it to Weiland to add lyrics. In full tour mode, the quartet will take the United States by force from August to October.
Sublime with Rome
In 1988, Sublime came to life, taking over the radio waves of KROQ and establishing a solid reputation with its infusion of ska and reggae. The legacy of Sublime came to an end with the death of 27-year-old frontman Bradley Nowell 14 years ago.
Now, Bud Gaugh (bass) and Eric Wilson (drums) decided to add singer and guitarist Rome Ramirez into the mix. Their tour kicked off in July with one stop in Costa Mesa, Calif. and will end in Brazil Oct. 10.
Soundgarden
Sept. 28 will mark the much-anticipated release of Soundgarden’s new album Telephantasm. As far back as January, lead singer Chris Cornell Tweeted that the band would get together again after a long 12 years of separation.
With a Lollapalooza performance under their belts, Cornell and company are ready to pick up where they left off.
Bands break up or go on “hiatus” every day, but the resurgence of the six aforementioned bands and other recent reunions of bands like Taking Back Sunday (its original lineup is now together again for the first time since 2003) and blink-182 gives many music fans hope.
To add to the growing trend, Twitter is recently abuzz with hints that Los Angeles-based band Yellowcard could be getting back together after a two-year hiatus.
Some bands find it hard to survive in the  music industry and often times need to re-evaluate themselves both personally and professionally, making break-ups somewhat common.
Fortunately for fans, though, artists who truly have a passion for music can never give it up, and in due time, most musical appetites are satisfied through much anticipated reunions or brand new endeavors.

The dust has settled.
In the last year, USC has seen a new president, a new football coach, a new $130-million campus center, a $900-million proposal to renovate the dilapidated University Village and the first steps of its 30-year Master Plan take place.
Now that so many of the university’s efforts have come to fruition, it is time to look outside our own walls.
Before Steven B. Sample passed the torch to President C. L. Max Nikias he made sure that the university’s legacy — and his own — was not just one of academic and athletic paragon, but of diversity, service and community outreach. USC’s devotion to philanthropy and community service in the surrounding neighborhoods of Los Angeles has been just as indelible a trademark as any admission statistic or Heisman Trophy.
The student body must now consider how the monumental changes we have effected around campus will impact the city to which we are so closely tied.  We must be aware that as we expand our own horizons, we take with us the future of a metropolitan giant.
With our school now occupying a higher profile, the time has come to increase student involvement in our outreach programs; we must also hold our administrators accountable to avoid a myopic vision of the future that focuses solely on campus development.
USC often touts its “College of the Year” award, which it won in 2000 for outstanding community service. But we can’t continue to pat ourselves on the back for accolades we collected a decade ago. The Joint Educational Project, the USC Good Neighbors Campaign, Local Vendor Program, Small Business Clinic and a host of other enterprises designed with the Los Angeles community in mind can ensure that the Trojan spirit that won us that honor will not be forgotten.
Throughout all the renovations, the restorations, the Master Plans and the changing faces of our university, our city, malleable as it is, will be the constant that does not change.
“USC is here for the long term,” Sample said in 1992.  “We will not be sold or merged or moved to Phoenix.”
Let the legacy of USC’s service to our community be just as enduring.

Oftentimes when describing a team accomplishment, the cliché “the sum is greater than its parts” comes to mind.
In many ways tennis is a very individual sport, but this past spring the USC men’s tennis team won the NCAA championship by validating that cliché and utilizing a collection of talent that performed at its best when acting as a whole.

The Trojans really needed a special performance in the championship match against No. 2 Tennessee, especially with many vocal Volunteer supporters in attendance.
“The most intense moment for us this year was after we lost the doubles point to Tennessee,” said junior Steve Johnson.  “We hadn’t won a match all year after losing the doubles point — which was added pressure, but we came together and came out very strong in the singles.”
A collective spirit was the main factor the players attributed to the ability to come back and win four of six singles matches to win the championship — following the loss of the doubles point.
“Everyone on court in singles and everyone around the team and around the courts showed big mentality to fight back,” said senior Peter Lucassen.
The Trojan singles lineup started off with some strong performances from the top two slots, with Johnson winning at the second slot and then-senior Robert Farah defeating the No. 1 ranked J.P. Smith in the top slot to tie the match score up at 2-2.
“We’ve got some really good players that believed in themselves,” said USC coach Peter Smith. “We had some really powerful performances with No. 1 and No. 2 singles winning in straight sets. That’s special.”
Lucassen followed his teammates with another straight-set victory, giving USC its first lead of the match.
After dropping the first set in a tiebreak, junior Daniel Nguyen dominated the rest of the match — only losing one game in the final two sets to capture the trophy.
The Tennessee match marked the second in a row that Nguyen clinched — he won the deciding match against top-ranked Virginia the day before in the semifinal round.
“I grew tremendously throughout the tournament, each match I prepared myself to exceed expectation,” Nguyen said. “I’m known to get really nervous throughout my matches and having one year of college tennis has helped me develop into a more mature player. The UVA and [Tennessee] matches were probably the biggest matches I’ve played, having my teammates and a great coaching staff have helped me win these huge matches.”
This championship was the second in a row for Smith’s squad, raising the Trojans’ all-time team championship total to 18 — the most among NCAA men’s tennis programs.
In comparing the two championships, the most recent proved more satisfying to those involved.
“The second championship was even better than the first one,” Johnson said. “To be able to come back and repeat as national champions really shows everyone how special of a team we had.”
Nguyen was named the NCAA Tournament’s Most Outstanding Player for winning five matches during the course of the tournament.
“Its an honor to be named [Most Outstanding Player] because there are so many great tennis players competing in the NCAA team championships,” Nguyen said.
Along with Nguyen’s honor, five Trojans were also named to the NCAA All-Tournament Team: Farah and Johnson were awarded the  No. 1 doubles spot, with Nguyen and sophomore J.T. Sundling at No. 2 doubles. The No. 1 singles award went to Farah as well, with the second spot given to Johnson, the fourth to Nguyen and the sixth to Lucassen.
Later in the summer, the awards kept coming in for USC as Farah was awarded the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National College Player of the Year and Smith was named the ITA National Coach of the Year.
The stockpile of awards, along with the team’s second national championship in as many years, stands as a testament to USC‘s depth of talent, as well as the ability of all those involved with the team to succeed at the highest levels of collegiate tennis.
“The NCAA Championship was my best experience so far in my tennis career,“ Lucassen said. “To win this championship you need good players on the team. But I think we won the championship because we showed how good we are as a team not only with players, but with coaches and trainers as well.”

USC’s university-wide hiring freeze finally came to a conclusion on July 1, but officials say that departments will still be carefully evaluating the need to create new positions from here on out.
The university initiated the freeze in 2008 as a financial buffer in the slowing economy. The freeze was originally scheduled to end in June  2009, but university officials announced an extension of the freeze last year.
“The hiring freeze was a pre-emptive move to make sure we wouldn’t be in a position where we would have to cut out any of our programs,” said Robert Cooper, vice provost for planning and budget.
Before the freeze, departments could create new staff and faculty positions at their own discretion, as long as they had the funds to do so.
Anticipating that families of university employees could be impacted by the economy, USC initiated the freeze as a precaution to prevent any dramatic layoffs or other cutbacks during the economic recession.
“The financial issue for USC was minimal,” Cooper said. “We did not see a reduction in the number of students, so in terms of tuition revenue, we weathered the storm.”
The university implemented a new hiring process that asked each department to closely analyze new positions and streamline any administrative work during the freeze. Hiring requests were handled on a case-by-case basis within each department, before being sent to the university and then to the provost’s office for a final decision.
“Deans were to look at the positions and they were asked to only post the critical positions,” Cooper said.
Though the freeze is now over, the university will continue to follow the hiring procedures enacted for the last two years. The process requires analysis of each new position and top approval for those positions, Cooper said.
According to Cooper, the administration wanted to ensure that the student experience at USC would not change if the university experienced any sort of financial difficulty.
“It was not an across the board, ‘no exceptions made’ type of freeze,” Cooper said. “We wanted to make sure what we did didn’t impact the students.”
Geneva Overholser, director of Annenberg’s School of Journalism, said her department was able to make hires during the freeze when it was necessary.
“We are lucky since many of our fellow journalism schools, especially state schools, were not able to hire faculty,” Overholser said. “We have been very blessed with wonderful faculty hires we made during the freeze and I am grateful to the university for keeping the faculty lines open to hiring.”
Samantha Klein, a senior majoring in fine arts, said she did not notice any changes because of the hiring freeze.
“As a student, the only reason I knew there was a hiring freeze was because I heard people where I work in [Information Technology Programs] talking about it,” Klein said. “Other than that I didn’t notice anything, especially since the school stepped up the off-campus security with all the new guards.”
USC is currently looking to create 550 new positions.
How about this? Since SC rose in rankings, to #23 on US News’ report (beating those envious ones in Westwood), how about USC start attracting more prominent researchers, professors and Nobel laureates?…a la the bRuins. That’s why they were so ahead of us in terms of academic rank/prestige. USC needs to carefully cull the right individuals to fill department needs. SC has come a long way from nearly 2 decades ago, and much credit is due to former President Sample. But President Nikias has big shoes to fill; and SC has been filling the football basket with most of their eggs. 
How about turning SC into an academic powerhouse, on par with the Ivies, Stanford, or MIT? We’re on probation for 2 years, and those clowns across town, with their pathetic #8 rank in the Pac 12 won’t get close to a bowl game anyways. 
Yeah yeah, I know. Los Angeles has two giants when it comes sports–SC Trojan football–and the Lakers.

Hey, Trojan fans — do you remember where you were when you found out that your favorite football team would be banned from the postseason for the next two years?
It happened around mid-day on June 10. Midwesterners and West Coasters, you probably found out right around lunchtime on that Thursday from — well, you know.
East Coasters, you might have been on your way home from a stressful New York City internship or settling in for what you expected to be a nice, peaceful dinner at home.
Well, whenever and wherever it was that you heard the news, I’m willing to bet that it’s probably not a happy place for you  anymore — and with good reason. But for those of you who wonder if the Coliseum will take on the same hellish attributes, I’m here to say you can safely hold on to some hope.
Here’s the thing: Upon examination, the sanctions aren’t as extreme as they seem.
The postseason in college football is completely different than the postseason in college basketball. On the basketball court, a postseason ban could mean a loss of seven games; on the gridiron, it can’t possibly mean more than one.
In that same vein, you could very well argue that the self-imposed one-year ban for the basketball team in January was a stricter punishment — at least from the players’ perspective.
Yes, football’s two-year ban technically makes the next two seasons meaningless for the Trojans, with a national championship out of the question.
But other big goals are possible. It’s not like the Trojans are banned from winning all their games. And a 13-0 season would surely be regarded as an indubitable success for the 2010 Trojans, BCS bowl game or not.
It’s all about perspective, really. A 13-0 — or 12-1, even — season is unlikely for this team. But, truthfully, those records weren’t going to be likely even if USC had come away scot-free from the whole Reggie Bush debacle.
And here’s the other thing. If you ask first-year coach Lane Kiffin what he thinks the implications of the NCAA-imposed sanctions will be for the future of the USC football program, he’ll minimize them.
If you ask rival coaches what they think the implications of the NCAA-imposed sanctions will be or what the future holds for the USC football program, they’ll maximize them.
Kiffin might or might not be many  of the things that he is believed to be by many members of the public — a good coach, a bad guy and all that stuff.
But he is definitely one thing: a good recruiter. The man — and his lead assistant, defensive coordinator Ed Orgeron — can recruit with the best of them.
And they are very, very familiar with how to minimize weaknesses and maximize strengths.
That’s what the semi-immediate future of the football program (think 2011 and beyond) will come down to. Given a significant headstart of sorts, will other teams in the conference and the nation be able to out-recruit Kiffin, Orgeron and company?
Maybe, but maybe not.
The loss of 10 scholarships a season — bringing the allotted total down from 25 to 15 — beginning next August and continuing until the 2013 season will be significant, yes.
But deadly?
No.
How many scholarship players do you think the Trojans have in the class of 2014?
Fewer than you think — 18. And only 17 have actually enrolled at the time this article was published.
So you’re telling me, essentially, a loss of two December or January games and nine or so recruits over the next three years will mean the death of the USC football program.
Sounds a little extreme when you put it like that, doesn’t it?
Much more likely than complete implosions are a couple 11-2 or 10-3 seasons for the next two or three years and a return to glory by about 2015.
The University of Miami had similar sanctions placed on its football program back in 1995. The Hurricanes won a national title just six years later, in 2001. That’s entirely possible for the Trojans.
In the meantime, you’ll have to deal with some taunts from your Pac-10 school-attending friends and some smaller crowds at the Coliseum for the Washington States of the country, but it’ll be over before you know it.
Seriously.

It’s official. Contracts have been signed, Utah and Colorado have been abducted, and the red-headed step-conference of the NCAA is back — bigger, badder and with a brand new name.  That’s right, after months of frenzied negotiation and reckless speculation, the Pac-10 Conference is now the Pac-12.
Of course, Utah and Colorado aren’t the only additions to the conference.  Expansion comes complete with a sleek new website, an inspirational promotional video and a racy new logo with waves, mountains and curves that would make the Stanford Tree blush.
“The response has been terrific,” said Pac-10 Commissioner Larry Scott.  “People are craving change, they’re craving energy.”
Yes, it’s all very exciting. But besides a new logo and a media day in New York, expansion also means new television markets and a new conference title game.  And that means new revenue for every school in the conference.
“Almost all conference expansion is driven by television and media in general and the ability to turn those alignments into dollars for the member institutions,” Stanford Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby told The Stanford Daily. “And so I’d say that this one was driven as much by that as any other factor.”
Katrina MacGregor | Daily Trojan
Coincidentally, the Pac-10’s current TV contract with Fox Sports Net expires after the 2011-2012 academic year.  Now the Pac-12 has two options: sell its media rights to a network like ESPN, or create a new Pac-12 conference network.  The Big Ten Network makes the conference about $75 million in annual rights fees.  ESPN and CBS nets the SEC just more than $200 million a year. Compared to the Pac-10’s current $45-million deal with Fox, either option makes Larry Scott a financial genius.
Coaches around the league seem to be embracing the change.
“I think it’s smart,” said Oregon football coach Chip Kelly. “I have friends back in the Northeast that want to see us play but they’re getting Big 12 games. Why aren’t they getting Pac-10 games?”
The biggest change for Pac-12 coaches, however, will likely come at the end of the season.  Current NCAA bylaws mandate that a conference must have at least 12 teams to hold a title game. Now, for the first time in conference history, the West Coast can play for a championship.
Scott knows that a conference title game means more buzz, more media contracts and more money. But a championship game could help springboard a highly ranked Pac-12 team into the BCS National Championship too. In recent years, SEC and Big 12 Conference Championship games have helped conference winners like Alabama, Florida and Texas impress voters and computers in the last moments of the pre-bowl season. A high-profile conference championship could give Pac-12 contenders a similar edge.
Then again, as ESPN’s Ted Miller points out, a championship game could just as well give a conference David one last chance to trip up Goliath.
“As for an 8-3 team beating an unbeaten team for the title,” Miller wrote in May, “that’s the risk inherent in a championship game.”
Furthermore, organizing the conference schedule around a conference championship means dividing the conference. And that’s where things get messy.
For now, a north-south split seems most likely. This would divide the conference into northern and southern sections; California, Stanford, Oregon, Oregon State, Washington and Washington State would form the north division, and USC, Utah, Colorado, UCLA, Arizona, and Arizona State  would make up the south.
However, even with a nine-game conference schedule, a horizontal split would deny northern section teams their annual recruiting pilgrimage to Southern California, the Mecca of West Coast recruiting. Also, northern section teams would be reluctant to forfeit home games with USC every other year, which typically turn out big crowds and big payoffs.
The alternate scenario, a “zipper split,” would divide the conference along traditional rivalries: A western division would group Washington, UCLA, California, Arizona State, Oregon State and Utah together, and the eastern division would be made up of USC, Oregon, Colorado, Washington State, Stanford, and Arizona.
Besides creating a less regional, more expensive conference, the zipper split would likely ruffle Buffalo feathers, as newcomer Colorado claims to have been promised a spot in the southern section with USC and UCLA.
So congratulations, Trojans. You’re right back at the center of the new Pac-12 universe, and all the mess, too.
So what does this all mean for USC?
Right now — nothing.
“The intention is that [the integration] would start in 2012 for all sports,” Scott said.
So the Trojans have some time to prepare for, and become eligible for, a championship game and all the glitz and glamour of a shiny new conference.
And then they can really welcome their new conference friends to Southern California in the Coliseum.

Virtually every discussion about USC sports in the past few months has been a negative one. After a tumultuous off-season of sanctions, lawsuits, transfers and new faces, it’s easy to wonder how USC, once the bastion of college football dominance, came to this very precarious position.
Busted - Reggie Bush’s illicit activity with outside agents during his time at USC from 2003-2006 was the main reason for the sanctions handed out by the NCAA over the summer. Bush is now banned from campus. - Daily Trojan file photo
So, how exactly did we get here?
The thunderstorm began in June when the NCAA ruled that USC showed a  “lack of institutional control” over its athletic programs and “failed to heed warning signs” regarding improper benefits given to former stars Reggie Bush and O.J. Mayo.
The football team was hit hardest. Its punishment includes a two-year postseason ban, a loss of 30 scholarships over three seasons and four years of probation. USC also had to vacate 14 wins spanning the 2004-2005 seasons in which Bush participated, which includes the 2004 national championship victory over Oklahoma.
Former USC coach Pete Carroll, who accepted the head coaching position for the Seattle Seahawks in January, said he was surprised by the findings.
“I’m absolutely shocked and disappointed in the findings of the NCAA,” Carroll said in a video statement. “I never thought it would come to this.”
Carroll’s exit turned out to be the first of many moves that would turn the athletic department upside down. A few days after Carroll jumped north to Seattle, Lane Kiffin abandoned his post as head coach of Tennessee after just one year to become the new coach of the Trojans.
More recently, new president C.L. Max Nikias announced the replacement of former athletic director Mike Garrett with former USC quarterback Pat Haden, though it was not clear why Garrett left the position. Haden, a former member of the USC Board of Trustees, has made it apparent that running a clean program will be his top priority.
“We want to compete ferociously and win in every sport, but we want to do it ethically and within the rules,” Haden said after accepting the job. “We’re going to have a culture of compliance around here. Every meeting is going to start with the No. 1 item as compliance.”
For Haden, compliance applies to the entire athletic department. USC’s basketball team imposed its own sanctions before the NCAA ruling, denying itself postseason eligibility last season. It also vacated all 21 wins from the 2007-2008 season, Mayo’s only year at USC. The NCAA imposed no further sanctions, acknowledging that the self-imposed punishment was fitting for the team’s violations.
The women’s tennis team was also included in the NCAA probe, and was cited for improper phone calls made between November 2006 and May 2009. The  team sanctioned itself by vacating wins during that stretch, and the NCAA also did not take any further action.
Yet, everything centers around football, and most notably Bush. The NCAA said Bush had dealings with two up-and-coming sports marketers, who hoped to sign the star running back by giving him lavish gifts, including hotel stays, limousines and rent-free accomodations for Bush’s family. Despite the accusations, Bush still denies any wrongdoing.
The supposed smoking gun for the case was the involvement of former USC running backs coach Todd McNair. McNair was not identified by name in the NCAA report, but is widely believed to be the voice on a recorded phone conversation where a USC coach is discussing Bush’s setup with the two prospective agents.
McNair was the first staff member released following the announcement of the sanctions.
“Todd McNair’s contract expired on June 30, 2010,” Kiffin told the Los Angeles Times in early July. “We have no additional comment.”
Carroll, who can’t seem to get away from USC-related questions even in Seattle, was not named in the NCAA report and claims to have had no knowledge of any illicit actions regarding Bush.
USC has done all it can to distance itself from the Heisman winner. Nikias ordered in July that the replica of Bush’s Heisman Trophy be removed from Heritage Hall and all murals of Bush and Mayo be removed from university grounds.
“The Trojan Family honors and respects the USC sporting careers of those persons whose actions did not compromise their athletic program or the opportunities of future USC student-athletes,” Nikias said in a letter.
Additionally, the USC media guide will be riddled with asterisks beside every win or record that either Bush or Mayo was a part of marked as such.
Moving from the past to the present, the NCAA sanctions have expectedly led to vacancies on the field,  because of a clause included in the punishment that allows junior and senior players to transfer without losing the usual year of eligibility. A slew of players decided to jump ship, including defensive end Malik Jackson, linebackers Jarvis Jones and Jordan Campbell, receiver Travon Patterson and fullback D.J. Shoemate. Recruits Seantrel Henderson and Glen Stanley also asked out of their letters of intent and were granted their release by the university.
The departures create a major problem in depth for the Trojans. The team currently has 70 scholarship players, 15 below the NCAA limit.
As if enough controversy hadn’t already saddled the program, the Tennessee Titans filed a lawsuit against Kiffin and the university for allegedly making contact with offensive coordinator Kennedy Pola illegally. Kiffin supposedly contacted Pola without the Titans’ written permission, which is a breach of Pola’s contract. Pola is now the offensive coordinator at USC.
Needless to say, with the beginning of fall camp in early August, the Trojans are just happy to get back to football and return to some state of normalcy. Senior center Kristofer O’Dowd said the team had moved on long ago.
“It’s been over with,” O’Dowd said. “We know what we need to do as a unit, as a team. We have our own goals to accomplish. We’re the players. Players play, coaches coach.”
Still, things just weren’t quite the same on Howard Jones Field at the beginning of fall camp, mainly because practices are now closed to the general public, another fallout of the sanctions. The beginning of training camp typically brings fans numbering in the hundreds out to watch, but that won’t be possible for another four years.
“It’s definitely different,” sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said.
Kiffin, who was used to packed practices when he was an assistant at USC, said he didn’t notice it for very long.
“The first 10 minutes maybe you noticed, but after that it didn’t make a difference,” he said.
As turbulent as this offseason has seemed, the storm has not yet passed for the Trojans, as playing through the sanctions is going to be a major challenge. But the Trojans seem ready for the obstacle, as players like redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo have jumped to fill much-needed leadership roles to keep the team on track.
“You just kind of got to talk to the younger guys and just regulate and keep everyone level-headed,” Galippo said.
On top of steadying the ship, Galippo was able to put the season into a larger perspective.
“The important thing about college football is we’re all trying to make a career out of this for ourselves,” he said. “Regardless of what goes on outside here or these practice gates, we’ve got to play ball.”
While the team is playing ball, the university will appeal the NCAA ruling in hopes of lessening the magnitude of the punishment.
“We felt the penalties imposed are too severe,” USC senior vice president Todd Dickey said.
USC is certainly not the first school to be dealt such punishment, and the violations themselves do not seem to be the central topic of debate. Rather, the argument has been raised that the penalties do not align with previous decisions handed down to other schools.
One case in point are the penalties imposed on Alabama in 2002. The Crimson Tide was also cited for a lack of institutional control by the NCAA, as boosters were found to be paying high school prospects; and like USC, Alabama was a repeat offender. But despite violations that involved more players and people linked to the football team than in USC’s case, Alabama only received a reduction of 21 scholarships over three years in addition to a two-year bowl ban — nine less than the 30 scholarships that the Trojans will lose.
USC can present its appeal to the NCAA Division I Infractions Appeals Committee on Sept. 25, the board’s soonest upcoming hearing date. It is unclear whether the university’s appeal will be heard on that date, however.
Judging by the low success rate of recent appeals from other athletic programs dealing with similar situations, the university’s chance at a successful appeal looks bleak — the NCAA has upheld its ruling in 10 of the 11 cases it has heard in the last two years. If USC loses its appeal, the BCS will likely strip the Trojans of its 2004 championship. The Associated Press, however, said the Trojans would keep the AP title.
It’s little consolation to a past problem that is affecting the present.

We all have our own favorite dives in our city, neighborhood or town. That regional hot spot could be a non-franchised hole-in-the-wall that serves messy, sleeves-up grub or the jazzy new talk of the town, established by a celebrity chef and frequented by young hipsters.
Good eats - The Original Pantry Café located on Ninth and Figueroa streets was established more than 80 years ago. Currently, the historic restaurant offers its trademark culinary items 24 hours a day.  - James Watson | Daily Trojan 
Whichever it is, it’s the food and atmosphere that keep you coming back, and you remember it fondly whenever you leave home. It’s time to develop some new personalized local favorites, right here in Los Angeles.
Are you a breakfast lover who would tuck into eggs and bacon at midnight? Do you love the idea of pitch forking into a greasy mountain of food for minimal dollars? Consider camping at The Original Pantry Café, just a 10-minute drive from USC at Ninth and Figueroa streets and open 24 hours a day. Established in 1924, The Original Pantry has been serving up hot grub for more than 80 years, non-stop.
Don’t go looking for kohlrabi puree on gleaming china; the diner lives up to its name and only sells iconic, original greasy spoon fare such as crisp-fried bacon, omelets with processed cheese, fluffy griddle pancakes, basic French toast, golden hash, country fried steak and good ol’ American apple pie— accompanied by complimentary sourdough bread and vegetables in the form of creamy coleslaw.
Likewise, The Original Pantry still maintains the traditional diner modus operandi and has its menu chalked into the walls. If you’re by yourself, skip the long lines by getting a seat by the counter. Watch the cook grill your bread right in front of you — if you can handle watching the amount of oil they use. Leave the plastic at home, the Pantry only takes cash.
On the other end of the spectrum, perhaps you care about animal cruelty and keeping the doctor away. If you like your food clean, fresh and cooked with minimal suffering of animals and the Earth, then take a drive out to The Veggie Grill on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood.
The Veggie Grill is a vegan cafe serving high-organic, meat-free, dairy-free, trans fat-free, cholesterol-free food that, surprisingly, still manages to retain great flavor.
Give it a try before you start smirking at its Santa Fe Crispy Chickin’ burger and Chop-Chop Chef salad. The “meat” tastes surprisingly authentic, and the salads are vibrant and plucked-from-the-garden fresh. Since everything is practically guilt-free anyway, go ahead and indulge yourself with a batch of Sweetheart Fries, crisp and flavorful sweet potato fries served with a snazzy chipotle “ranch” or with a ladle of Bean Me Up Chili.
Another plus? Parking validation, affordable prices, warm service and Trader Joe’s right next door. This is one place you’ll leave feeling warm fuzzies for your health and moral conscience.
Of course, you cannot live in Los Angeles and miss its Latin cuisine. Expand your gastronomical geography in the Latin world and give some other regional tastes a whirl (Taco Bell does not count).
Seek out Salvadoran food from Sarita’s Pupuseria at the Downtown Grand Central Market on Broadway Street. Sarita’s specializes in homemade pupusas, a traditional Salvadoran thick pancake handmade from masa, or dough, and stuffed with your choice of meats, seafood, cheese, beans or vegetables before griddled to perfection in front of your eyes.
Don’t expect fawning waiters, though; the service is quick and brash, and if you get lucky, you might lean up against the counters to enjoy your hot pupusas with plenty of napkins and hot sauce. But that’s all part of the experience. And at just $2.40 each, you can spend the rest of your money shopping for cheap fruits, vegetables and dried goods at the other market stalls.
If you’re willing to break away from the usual burrito and nacho “Mexican” fare, you need not go far to try yet another interesting regional food of Mexico. Chichen Itza, a small restaurant on Grand Avenue squeezed into the Latin marketplace Mercado La Paloma, offers a unique Yucatan culinary experience with an exquisite blend of Mayan, Spanish and Lebanese influences. USC students are lucky to have this restaurant so close to campus, because authentic Yucatan cuisine is rare in Los Angeles.
Chichen Itza is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Don’t worry about the unfamiliar dish names — everything tastes good here. Despite the fact that none of the dishes cost more than $10, each is presented elegantly with bright colors and meticulous plating.
One popular dish is the Cochinita Pibil, pork marinated in a famous Yucatan spicy paste made of annato seed and called achiote, sour orange juice and spices, and then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked until tender and fragrant. Vegetarians can try the papadzules, a corn crepe stuffed with creamy boiled eggs, drenched with mellow ground pumpkin seed and epazote sauce then topped with a tangy tomato sauce for contrasting flavors and colors.
Each of these places have their own unique style of food and atmosphere. Los Angeles might be dotted with high-end, celebrated restaurants and generic fast food chains, but it is just as easy to find a middle ground: someplace low-key with good, affordable food and a warm, inviting ambience. It all depends on your own tastes, personality and preferences. Keep a curious mind and an open stomach, and you’ll be fast on your way to establishing your own personal local favorite in Los Angeles.

In 2009, the digitally restored print of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s classic, The Red Shoes, debuted at the Cannes Film Festival. This marked the final chapter in a seven-year restoration effort led by Martin Scorsese and longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker.
Last July, a copy of the print was released by Criterion on DVD and Bluray. Though this column will normally be devoted to reviews of newly released films, it will honor this achievement with a review of The Red Shoes, first released in 1948.
The film opens with a crowd of students mobbing a theater in anticipation of the premiere of a ballet. Yes, a ballet. They are wild, frenzied, passionate and obsessed. It is clear that this ballet is the single focus of their lives. They sit and stare wide-eyed at the stage with a religious zeal that makes the members of the Manson family seem broad-minded. The question that arises in the viewer’s mind is a natural one: What in blue blazes is this?
Welcome to the world of Powell and Pressburger.
Three things stand out when you watch The Red Shoes: the beauty, the absurdity and the fact that the two go together. Let’s start with the absurdity; the plot.
The narrative is drawn from the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale of the same name, which tells the story of a young girl who comes across a pair of red slippers. She puts them on and begins to dance, more beautifully than she ever had before.
She dances and dances until she grows weary and tries to stop, but the red shoes will not let her. The red shoes do not stop, resulting in tragic consequences. Happy stuff, right?
Powell and Pressburger took Andersen’s fairy tale and used it as the basis for a story that deals with the intersection of life and art. The film’s focal point is the young Victoria Page (Moira Shearer), the new prima ballerina in the world famous Ballet Lermontov.
In her, impresario Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) sees the next great talent, if only she can dedicate her life to a single task: dancing. In Boris’ mind no room exists for anything but art. It is not the means to an end. It is an end in itself.
At first things go smoothly, but love intervenes in the form of young composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring), and Vicky must choose between art and love, for the one thing that Boris cannot stand is a ballerina with dual passions. If you know the ending to Anderson’s fairy tale, you can guess the ending to The Red Shoes.
The absurdity lies in Walbrook’s character. He is a man so obsessed with the art of dance that he has lost all humanity. He is vain, cruel, dismissive and utterly heartless. You will not find a more unsympathetic character. From his dancers he expects complete and absolute devotion. Otherwise, they’re gone. When asked how he expects to change human nature, he replies with a sneer, “I don’t. I intend to ignore it.”
Statements such as these make you want to take him by the collar and slap some good sense into him. But here’s the thing: If he had any sense, the film wouldn’t work. The plot would fall apart. He is the linchpin. Without his hard-line artistic stand, there is no conflict, no reason for Victoria to make any choice between dance and romance. She can have her cake and eat it too.
So the question now is: why? Why make a film about this? It’s all rather esoteric. Who really cares about what Victoria chooses? The simple answer is that nobody does. They don’t because the film isn’t about Victoria’s choice, no matter how many reviews you read to the contrary. It’s the conflict, but it’s not the film, and in this case there is a difference.
Whereas you can find the meaning of most films within the conflict and resolution, you cannot with The Red Shoes. No, the true meaning of The Red Shoes is found in the most unlikely of places: the production design.
The first thing that strikes you when you watch The Red Shoes is its beauty. Watching it is like watching a beautiful woman — you don’t ask why the woman is beautiful, you just appreciate the fact that she is. And The Red Shoes is beautiful. Every scene is an exercise in expressionist lighting. Every frame is lush and vibrant.
The highlight is the 17-minute ballet sequence that is integrated perfectly into the narrative. And yes, I know that praising a 17-minute ballet sequence is not the way to make people want to see a film, but it is brilliant to watch, a masterwork of cinema that would go on to inspire Gene Kelley and Stanley Donnen’s Singin’ in the Rain.
That is the point of The Red Shoes — to put something beautiful up on the screen. Look at the release date. 1948. The postwar era had begun. Britons were coming off of five years of brutal conflict, of being told to  die for country, to sacrifice. Viewers needed something new, something to regain a lust for life. Powell and Pressburger realized that
The Red Shoes told them to live — to live for beauty, to live for their passions, to live for themselves. To do this, Powell and Pressburger drew upon a story from an earlier age, a simpler age, one cloaked in familiarity and nostalgia. But their message is one for all times.
Ars gratia artis. Art for art’s sake.

Now passing through Los Angeles for the second time in almost a year, the Monster Ball is beginning to feel less like a concert tour and more like a traveling circus: Cities are being revisited, the production itself looks to be growing uncontrollably, tour dates are being added as long as there’s interest (which is to say stops are being added indefinitely).
Although the tour retains many elements of its first incarnation in late 2009 — Lady Gaga’s longtime partners-in-crime, the boys of Semi Precious Weapons, still open for her, and there’s precious little in the way of new material since Angelenos last saw her in December — the Monster Ball is undeniably a different beast.
That said, Gaga’s countless and impassioned devotees (her “Little Monsters,” as she likes to refer to her disciples) can rest assured that the tweaks are for the better, and make for a concert that, like its centerpiece herself, always seems unmistakably bigger and more outrageous than how you remember it.
Lady Starlight, another seasoned collaborator from Gaga’s early days in seedy New York City music clubs, opened Wednesday night’s show at the Staples Center with a wordless DJ set. Going on as early as she did, Starlight was spinning mostly for the benefit of the highest paying fans, those in the Little Monsters Club who were allowed first grabs at coveted ground floor spots along the stage and the catwalk that extended out from it.
Her first three song selections, “Welcome To The Jungle,” “Crazy Train” and “Eye Of The Tiger,” set the tone for a set that would prove to be heavy on classic rock throughout. She danced non-stop, availing herself of a silver medicine ball and old-school jump rope at one point and tomahawk-like juggling equipment at another. Despite her high energy, it quickly became clear why it was Gaga, and not Starlight, who was able to break out of the burlesque circuit into mainstream pop culture. Although the unmarketable grunge aesthetic appears to have been a passing phase for Gaga, it’s clear the aesthetic is deeply rooted in Starlight’s persona as a performer.
In the course of Semi Precious Weapons’ too-long opening set, frontman Justin Tranter made it clear that he fancies himself an innovator in the genre of shock rock. His gratuitous crudity and self-conscious affectations of vanity (his response to even decidedly generous amounts of applause: “More!”) were almost unendurable, but the talents of drummer Dan Crean and backing scream-vocalist Cole Whittle made the irritating preening of amateur provocateur Tranter just bearable.
When Gaga finally took the stage just after 9 p.m., there was less energy than might be expected. Embarrassingly for the two warm-up acts, the minute Gaga’s motionless silhouette — locked in a dramatic Grace Jones-like pose as the opening beats of “Dance In The Dark” filled the Staples Center — gradually began to appear on the video screen that shielded the stage served to electrify the gathered masses more than any of the opening performers could. Backlit and standing stock-still, Gaga is still better able to whip a crowd into a frenzy than any other performer currently on the touring circuit.
The most noticeable change to the tour’s nightly performances is the addition of a narrative to the performance. The story follows a handful of Gaga’s friends as they make their way to the Monster Ball, the biggest party on the planet and a place where the superstar says all are encouraged to be true to themselves. The preachy, after-school special message — a constant throughout all of her interviews and performances — is more than a little clichéd at this point, but definitely not irrelevant to her numerous fans in the LGBT community.
The friends encounter a number of obstacles on their trek down the Glitter Road — a broken down car was labored over to the relatively obscure tune of “Glitter And Grease,” for instance, and the nightmarish “Fame Monster,” an anglerfish-like creature with tentacles, was vanquished as the heroine sang “Paparazzi” — but they eventually reached The Monster Ball.
As could be expected, the loose plot allowed for myriad costume changes (she donned a new outfit or shed a crucial piece of clothing approximately every other song). Audiences got to see the sparking cone bra from Gaga’s photo shoot for TIME magazine for themselves, as well as a few other outfits that were familiar from appearances and award shows. She performed “So Happy I Could Die” as a fiber-optic animatronic version of Glinda the Good Witch, and the famed “Gagasphere” thankfully made a return in her encore performance of “Bad Romance.”
Despite the fact that Gaga’s recent performances at Staples Center were part of a tour that began nearly one year ago, significant updates to the production — to say nothing of the newly penned rock number “You And I” — certainly warranted Lady Gaga’s “second coming.”

Los Angeles has made a name for itself as a city with a plethora of diverse dining options. Throughout various ethnic enclaves within the metropolis, residents are given the opportunity to taste the finest Japanese garnishes, Greek flavors and Indian spices — all without leaving Los Angeles.
Meals on wheels - The Calbi barbeque truck is one of the many food trucks that frequent the USC area as well as greater Los Angeles. - Ted Gerike | Daily Trojan
Although most of these cultural eateries are found in restaurants scattered across the city, some are rolling through the city on wheels. Food trucks are becoming more and more prevalent in Los Angeles, catering to loyal followers who can appreciate a rather unconventional meal.
The USC campus, frequented by thousand of pedestrians daily, provides a high-traffic hub for the lunch trucks to park their kitchens and serve everything from pizza to Brazilian barbeque.
For the many students who live within a few blocks of campus, these restaurants-on-wheels couldn’t be more conveniently located. Highly visible, the food trucks attract hordes of hungry people during lunchtime, often crowding the busiest areas near the crosswalks off campus.
But although the food trucks generally stake out the same busy intersections that draw large numbers of pedestrians (such as the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue), they don’t always appear at the same location.
For this reason, many lunch trucks use Twitter accounts to inform their devoted customers where they are at any given moment.
USC alumna Lindsey Garrett, a former employee at Barbie’s Q — a food truck that specializes in barbeque beef and chicken sandwiches — testified to the value of using the social networking site for the business.
“Using Twitter is not only a cool way to allow customers to find us but also to integrate technology in the food truck service world,” she said.
Some trucks have gained a great deal of publicity with the help of this social media network. For example, Kogi BBQ — the self-proclaimed “Los Angeles landmark that serves up Korean Mexican tacos, day and night” — boasts a giant fan base of more than 69,000 followers on Twitter.
Kogi has garnered an immense amount of popularity, despite catering to customers from only four trucks. Kogi followers receive several Tweets per day, explaining when and where to find a truck. Kogi’s dishes uniquely combine Korean barbeque with Mexican tortillas and fresh vegetables. Under the supervision of chef Roy Choi, Kogi effectively created a menu that satisfies both the hectic schedules of Angelenos and their desire for new culinary tastes.
To make matters even more exciting, Choi announces his daily specials over Twitter, making each Kogi experience a unique one. Unlike larger restaurants, the truck manages to reach out to customers, no matter where they might be. Food trucks such as his manage to turn their lack of a permanent location into a strength rather than a weakness.
And when it comes to competing with large restaurants and diners, the food trucks are not falling behind. In fact, the India Jones Chow truck, which serves authentic gourmet food on the streets, recently received a major accolade from critics. The Chow Truck was named a finalist at the first Los Angeles Vendy Awards — originally a New York premier street showcase event where the best sidewalk chefs participate in a cook-off competition.
With so many different food trucks emerging, a distinct culture is beginning to blossom — one significantly removed from the indoor dining set.
In fact, the emergence of these trucks even spurred the creation of an online phenomena beyond the ubiquitous Tweets. Food trucks fans can visit the website findlafoodtrucks.com, which was designed to help Los Angeles residents locate trucks. The website shows 56 different trucks’ Tweets on one page, helping hungry stomachs find an option that can glut the appetite.
With all the various food truck options available in the Los Angeles area, USC students will surely find a meal they can enjoy — or at least one they can call “an interesting experience.”
However, they should take advantage of this service while they have the opportunity, because the food trucks are only getting busier.

Every Sunday afternoon at the community center auditorium nearest you, a group of middle-aged music lovers — often in mod, hippie or rocker costumes — gather and jam out a set list heavily influenced by a classic rock mixtape procured with only two easy payments. And oh boy, if you close your eyes, it feels just like the real thing.
Darker My Love, a frustratingly talented L.A. quintet, drifts dangerously close to this territory on Alive As You Are, its disappointing third LP. After a somewhat promising eponymous debut album and a less promising second album, this derivative dud does little to inspire confidence in the future of the group.
The problems are evident from the opening notes of “Backseat.” The song is an American Beauty-era Grateful Dead folk-rambler that stalls at its halfway point where somebody had penciled in “guitar solo.” The rest of the song is actually very enjoyable, but the stock guitar work in that middle section is blatantly lazy. The more glaring problem is the complete lack of inventiveness. It doesn’t sound like a tip of the hat to their influences; it sounds like a ripoff.
The Rolling Stones receive the band’s sincerest flattery on “18th Street Shuffle,” and the Kinks are imitated on “New America.” There’s nothing wrong with the band  name-checking its idols, but without innovations, there’s nothing to distinguish the group from the pack.
It’s ironic and slightly sad the cuts that sound most like Darker My Love songs, which fall somewhere on the scale from original to modestly referential, are the weakest links. “Split Minute” hints at a hook that never materializes, and the repetitive and inappropriate synth riff detracts from serviceable lyrics.
Then there’s “Dear Author,” a shrug of a rocker that manages slight novelty by existing as an amalgam of the band’s other influences. A less annoying song would have cut the two-word drawl chorus, but then you’d just have “A Lovely Game,” a less annoying song.

In the thorough 2010 rock-doc You Weren’t There: A History of Chicago Punk 1877-1984, aging musicians and former punk scenesters bemoaning the death of “true punk” hit on an important caveat for, really, any musician. When asked about the state of punk today, one former Chicago studio musician responded, “I’m not supposed to like what you do. I’m almost 50 years old. You should be doing something that’s really gonna annoy me.”
Yes, he was talking about punk specifically, but it’s applicable to current music. Bands are breaking ground, making noise and getting out there, but other bands, often popular and even talented groups, do nothing to deconstruct aural traditions. To the innovators who came before them, that has to be really frustrating.
Frustrating. That’s maybe the best word to describe Darker My Love’s discography as it stands. Guitarist, songwriter and vocalist Tim Presley is more than capable of creating original tunes, as proven by his best work with former band the Nerve Agents and Darker My Love.
But on the weaker tracks from the first two DML albums and essentially the entire third album, he seems more dedicated to conceiving adorable tributes to his heroes. That’s a great way to start a garage band with your buddies. It’s a terrible way to fulfill the promise of your stronger work.
To be fair, the aforementioned promising Darker My Love material was always on par with that of the Dandy Warhols and Brian Jonestown Massacre. What made its prior albums different, especially its first, was a smooth combination of the former group’s creativity with a pinch of the latter group’s swagger. On Alive As You Are, creativity is inexplicably scant, and swagger is nonexistent.
The hope would be that this entire project is a fluke creative misstep. By many accounts, the band’s live performances are enjoyable affairs, and some of these tracks might gel better alongside choice cuts from the first two albums.
Darker My Love is certainly more talented than a cover band led by cool uncles, but if it chooses to straddle the line between reference and pastiche, it’ll have to work harder to stay relevant.
Hey, there’s always some bill space between Fred Zeppelin and Stone Temple Co-Pilots. But the guys from Darker My Love are better than that.

While the dust is settling on USC’s latest overhauls — University Gateway apartments and the Commons-turned-Ronald Tutor Campus Center — Los Angeles is going through a long overdue remodel.
Just as the stale square building in the center of campus has been replaced with a lofty community center flanked by an expansive plaza, neighborhoods across the city are realizing the negative impacts of our infamous urban sprawl. They are tearing down out-of-date structures, creating activist groups and hosting open-air programs that finally experiment with a term that has long eluded the City of Angels: public space.
In older cities, such as New York and San Francisco, the urban experience includes vibrant street life. But while small-sized blocks filled with mixed-use structures continue to make these Downtown areas culturally alive, Los Angeles as a whole is still suffering from its post-World War II growth, which leaves residents isolated in cars and on tree-lined residential streets.
However, Los Angeles wasn’t always this way.
Once upon the turn of the 20th century, Los Angeles was a burgeoning urban space with a historic cultural center (Olvera Street), a connective streetcar system (the Pacific Electric Railway) and an open-air marketplace (Grand Central Market).
By the 1920s, towns such as San Pedro, Chatsworth and San Bernardino had become destinations for new residents, but Downtown remained a bustling city center with apartment buildings, offices, department stores and its own flourishing theater district. Even as late as the 1940s, the city pulsated with urban potential.
Metropolis - Los Angeles has gone through many changes in recent years, building new structures to foster community engagement. - Justin Bettman | Daily Trojan
But then the car rolled into town and changed everything.
In the years after World War II, major streets were replaced with freeways and Downtown’s lively population slowly abandoned its diverse, density-driven roots, migrating instead to newly built suburbs oozing with uniformity. Historic buildings were demolished to build street-level parking lots, tract-homes took over former wheat empires and enclosed, cave-like, inward-facing shopping malls became de facto town squares.
At the turn of the new millennium, street life for many Angelenos consisted of sitting on the sidewalk patio at Coffee Bean (after driving there, of course).
While these new urban-planning faux pas have forced residents to live in the infamously community-deprived, detached locale of Bret Easton Ellis novels, the smog-clogged metropolis has been working to redeem itself by physically rebuilding the city it once threw away.
Areas such as Culver City, Long Beach and Pasadena have gone through Clueless-worthy makeovers complete with mixed-use structures, artist spaces, outdoor shopping areas and bicycle lanes — all of which aim to breathe life back into the city’s street culture.
Shopping centers, including The Grove, Santa Monica Place and the Americana at Brand, have reinvented their plots, creating open-air promenades that embrace the Southern California weather instead of hiding from it. And Downtown’s historic core, all but abandoned until a few years ago, is now full of young creatives who flocked to its restored apartment buildings and renewed urban nightlife.
With or without new structures, however, Los Angeles’ disparate neighborhoods are beaming with newfound local confidence. Community gardens and farmers markets are sprouting up from Woodland Hills to Watts and monthly art walks have transformed unlikely places like Claremont and Hermosa Beach into artistic hubs. New community-oriented events such as cultural and food fairs draw people from all areas of the city and the sense of isolation begins to disintegrate.
By engaging in more frequent natural contact with those that live near them, an entire generation of Angelenos is un-learning social distance and finally finding a sense of place in a city of built-in disconnection.
This citywide shift towards public life can be seen in action with the recent attention on the Los Angeles River. Various groups have been trying to get the city to do something productive with its 51-mile-long, mostly concrete flood-control channel for years — asserting that, despite its unpredictable flow, it deserves to be developed as a recreational space and habitat — but victories until now were minor.
Last month’s Environmental Protection Agency designation of the river as “traditional navigable waters,” however, gave it a much-needed new identity. Now protected under the Clean Water Act, the forgotten waterway is a hot topic among environmentalists who want to get rid of its surrounding fences, uproot the miles of concrete banks and create Los Angeles’s first urban river ecology.
The idea might sound far-fetched for those who have only seen the river while stuck in traffic on the 5 or 710 freeways, but cities such as Portland and St. Louis have fashioned downtown riverfronts full of public parks, walkways and mixed-use developments that thrive despite the constant flood risks.
In the end, it’s all about civic pride. New lofts and shopping centers can catalyze neighborhood renewal, but it is up to the residents to infuse it with their own cultural flavor. Ronald Tutor can donate a campus center with a spacious European-inspired plaza, but until students fill it with daily activity, it’s just a mass of eco-friendly construction material.
USC — like many other parts of Los Angeles — is a community in transition. In altering the stifling nature of on-campus social spaces, places such as University Gateway and the new campus center — to be followed by a University Village renovation — are redefining what it means to be part of an on-campus community by ensuring no one has to wander through a dingy basement in search of their next La Salsa fix.

In the 1930s, the master detective writer Raymond Chandler called his perennial setting of Los Angeles “a neon-lighted slum” with “no more personality than a plastic cup.”
Fortunately, history proved Chandler wrong. Since then, the city has kept the neon and gained a personality. The problem is not so much that the city lacks an identity, but that it has become a parody of itself. Although Los Angeles has grown and changed over the years, it developed a very limited view of its culture.
For all of its growth and diversity, Los Angeles’ “mainstream” scene has narrowed to the point of suffocation. Hollywood has become the go-to outlook on entertainment.
Everything is flashy, overdone and focused solely on the glitz and glamour aspect of Los Angeles.
With the completion of L.A. Live and the opening of new clubs that trend has only grown. It seems that these days Hollywood and L.A. Live are the only places to go to for a good time — or at least, that is what the message seems to be.
In a city like Los Angeles, that is unacceptable. USC students would do themselves a disservice not to go beyond the stereotype and find the rest of the city. Whether it is hidden, underground or local, there is a lot to see.
A good, easy way to begin exploring Los Angeles is to simply look at the alternatives to the “big name” locales.
Take the more traditional alternative to the Original Farmers Market at The Grove: the Grand Central Market. Located at Fourth and South Broadway streets — and dating back to 1917 — the market offers a wide array of produce from around the world and local, non-chain eateries. It is an interesting way to spend the day, get some good food and see some of Los Angeles’ history first hand.
One of the great things about Los Angeles that seems to get lost in the cultural osmosis is the city’s diverse neighborhoods. Funneled through Hollywood’s perspective, Los Angeles just looks like one singular entity to the rest of the country. For anyone living in the city, especially students, knowing the neighborhoods and what they offer is essential.
One of the most interesting neighborhoods in the area is Silver Lake. Just northwest of Downtown, the area was once the gritty “Gray Lake” of Chandler’s writings, but is now one of the centers of the arts in Los Angeles.
No place better encompasses the neighborhood’s cultural streak than the Bootleg Theater on Beverly Boulevard. Essentially a one-stop shop for the arts, it plays home to concerts, plays and art exhibits.
Silver Lake also hosts the Sunset Junction Street Fair. Running on Aug. 21-22, the festival features five stages and more than 20 different acts, from DJs to local bands and even a few national artists, including past guests The Henry Clay People, Built to Spill and The Eels. For anyone looking for a very dense set of live music, this festival is a great place to start.
Like Hollywood, some genres of the Los Angeles music scene get more exposure than others. Who would have thought that Los Angeles — the home of West Coast hip-hop and a strong indie music scene — would have a vibrant folk music culture?
In fact, Los Angeles has a unique, progressive folk scene, with artists blending traditional acoustic music and New Wave electronic. The New Los Angeles Folk Festival not only recognized the growth of the genre in the city, but is also committed to showcasing it. Although the main concert is on Aug. 7, the festival organizes shows across the city throughout the year.
At the same time, there are many things to do near campus for those without a car or the time to travel across the city. Take Downtown for instance. USC is practically adjacent to it, but aside from L.A. Live, it does not seem to be a hub for student activity. Unbeknownst to most USC students, there are many unique and unexpected events under the surface of the city’s label.
One of those events is the Downtown Los Angeles Film Festival. Running in early September, the festival is an offshoot of the successful Silver Lake Film Festival and focuses solely on Downtown-based artists and culture.
“We work, live and play in Downtown L.A., and so we want to share with others what an amazing place we think our ‘hometown’ is,” said Greg Ptacek, the festival’s director. “We don’t want to be everything to everybody. We’re not like Los Angeles Film Festival in that respect. If you live on the Westside or the Valley and don’t ‘get’ Downtown, that’s fine with us.”
And ultimately, that’s one of the best things about Los Angeles. It is a mix of cultures coming together, creating an eclectic urban blend that has its own individual flavors.
What makes the Los Angeles entertainment scene so strong is that it isn’t just a reaction to the staid mainstream, but rather a natural end result of it’s residents passions.
Don’t spend college only seeing a fraction of this city. Look around, and a whole new world will open up. After all, Los Angeles is much more than just a cliché.

You’d be hard-pressed to fault graduating seniors and members of the USC women’s water polo team Tumua Anae, Kami Craig, Forel Davies, Alexandra Kiss and Kally Lucas for feeling a little frustrated.
Champions - The USC women’s water polo team took home the 2010 NCAA Championship after beating Stanford 10-9 in the final. The title comes after two consecutive championship round losses in 2008 and 2009. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Info 
After all, the players came to USC with the hope of capturing a national championship, but for one reason or another, postseason success had seemingly eluded them. And much to their chagrin, it was primarily crosstown rival UCLA that contributed to their downfall.
In 2007, the Bruins handed the No. 3 Women of Troy a heartbreaking 7-6 semifinal loss that kept them out of the championship game. A year later in 2008, it was a similar script, as UCLA once again defeated the No. 2 Women of Troy when it mattered most — in the NCAA championship game.
But despite the exasperating finishes of 2007 and 2008, 2009 looked rather promising. Experienced two-meter Craig was back after taking the previous season off to train for the Olympics with the U.S. national team, and the rest of the group had gained more experience as well. They entered the postseason on a 14-game winning streak after just one loss during the regular season, and were even given the No. 1 seed by the NCAA selection committee.
However, the stretch run proved to be the latest version of Bill Murray’s Groundhog Day, as the Women of Troy suffered another agonizing championship defeat at the hands of the Bruins, losing 5-4.
In three years, despite three consecutive top-three finishes, the slipper didn’t seem to fit; the senior quintet had no postseason hardware to show for all their hard work and various accomplishments.
But that all changed on May 16.
Faced with the opportunity to end their collegiate careers on a positive note against conference rival Stanford in the NCAA championship game, the seniors guided the Women of Troy to a heart-thumping 10-9 victory, earning them that long-awaited national title.
“I can’t believe I’m even holding this trophy in my hands,” said Craig, who was named tournament MVP immediately after the win. “A lot of effort went into it this. It was about time.”
In the early moments of the contest, however, it didn’t appear as if it would take much effort for Craig and co. to finally get over the hump.
Despite an early Kelly Eaton goal that gave the Cardinal a 1-0 lead, USC would take advantage of several Stanford miscues. On its first 6-on-5 opportunity, junior two-meter Kristen Dronberger capitalized on the advantage, powering a shot through the net to knot the score at one apiece. Just moments later, teammate Patricia Jancso, a freshman two-meter, broke the tie and gave USC a 2-1 lead with a goal of her own. Before Stanford could seemingly make any adjustment, the Women of Troy’s lead ballooned to a three-goal margin in large part to a relentless offensive attack.
“We knew we were going to stay calm, composed and take it just one pass at a time, one play at a time, one quarter at a time,” Craig said. “Our game would then come together.”
With the team holding a 6-3 halftime lead, Craig’s proclamation appeared remarkably accurate, but as in past years, the journey to the top wouldn’t be particularly smooth.
As the third quarter began, USC slowly watched Stanford catch fire as driver Kim Krueger got a lob shot past goalie Tumua Anae just 48 seconds in, lowering the deficit to two. A minute later, Stanford cut the USC advantage to just one following a goal from driver Kelly Eaton.
With their lead suddenly in flux, the Women of Troy elevated their play on both ends of the pool. The defense, forced to stop a potent Stanford offense threatening to thwart the team’s title hopes, shut down the Cardinal when it mattered most, creating multiple Stanford turnovers. On the offensive end, USC took advantage of those miscues, scoring four consecutive goals to build a nearly insurmountable 10-6 lead midway through the fourth quarter.
“We needed to stay and play a smart game,” Anae said. “We still had a few minutes left so our focus was on defense and patience on offense. You don’t want to back down, but you don’t want to start playing bad water polo.”
But once again, Stanford dug its heels into USC’s four-goal lead. Following two quick goals, the Cardinal capitalized on a 6-on-5 opportunity, as two-meter Annika Dries netted her first score of the game to cut the deficit to just one with 45 seconds remaining.
“I couldn’t even watch,” Craig said. “At one point, I was just holding hands with my teammates on the bench, just waiting for the buzzer to go off. That last possession was the longest of my life.”
Yet for once, the stars aligned for Craig and her fellow seniors, as they held onto their narrow lead and avoided what could have been another postseason disaster.
“It was honestly one of the best feelings in the world,” said driver Kally Lucas, one of the team’s five seniors, after the win. “The best part about it is that I am doing it with my best friends. This is my last water polo game ever and to go out with a win is so exciting for me.”
The win also gave coach Jovan Vavic, who coaches the men’s team in the fall, his third national championship on the women’s circuit and eighth overall. But as usual, he was quick to deflect any praise.
“This was a 100 percent team effort,” Vavic said. “We had so many players play well. Our seniors played a great game. They played with lots of fire, lots of heart. I am so happy to see them end their careers with a win.”

Dear Class of 2014,
Welcome to college. In the next four years, you will experience a period of unprecedented personal growth, new experiences and weight gain.
Katrina MacGregor | Daily Trojan
The reality is — as most college students can attest — the Freshman 15 is very common and, given the countless pitfalls college presents, most likely coming to a waist near you. However, given the right mind set and the proper preparation, you can coast through college lean, mean and eating more than just a bowl of greens.
The Food
Think back to dinners at your house growing up — what’s on the plate? Maybe some stir-fried chicken with rice, a bowl of pasta, a couple of slices of pizza, a big glob of peanut butter, a plate of chicken nuggets — wait, that was what I ate my freshman year when given unlimited, unchecked and deliciously glistening food choices.
What you should do instead is model your plate of food after how it used to looked at home, when it was coming to you from your mom and not the all-you-can-eat buffet at Everybody’s Kitchen. Chances are good your plate at home had a protein element — some fish, perhaps a piece of meat — a starch like rice or bread, a big pile of vegetables and maybe some fruit on the side, or a dessert — it’s not going to kill you.
Keep this blueprint in mind. Notice there’s no spot to squeeze in a slice of pizza twice a day or your evening waffle. Those things are fine on occasion, but remember that the Freshman 15 lives and dies by moderation.
One more tip: It’s important not to entirely excommunicate certain junk foods from your diet in the name of “good health.” Walking past the frozen yogurt machine every day and refusing even a taste is going to make you crazy to the point where you’ll plant a chair under the machine and eat until there’s chocolate oozing out of your pores.
Eating junk food occasionally is fine — I think my check-ins at Taco Bell can attest to that — but it’s important to remember that the real weight gain comes from lifestyle choices, and the dining hall is ground zero for that.
The Drink
There’s one quick fix that curbs the Freshman 15, but the average college student is not going to like it. Consider a few numbers though: a typical shot of hard alcohol racks up 65 calories, a 12-ounce can of beer clocks in at 150 and a mixed drink with fruit juice or soda hits upwards of 250 calories.
Now let’s see if this scenario has any upperclassman nodding in agreement. It’s a Thursday night; you get ready to go out and take a couple of shots, walk to a party and take another shot in celebration, drink a red Solo cup of rum and Coke on the dance floor, take a shot with those guys from your discussion section, maybe play a few games of beer pong and eventually call it a successful night.
Congratulations, that was also about 1,000 calories (excluding, of course, the 700 calories you banked from those four Jack-in-the-Box tacos on your way back). If you’re going out twice a week, we’re talking about 2,000 new calories in your diet. That’s enough to win you a couple of bonus pounds per month.
The moral of this story is not that you can’t enjoy yourself from time to time, but rather that most college students are blissfully unaware of the caloric wallop alcohol packs. At seven calories per gram, alcohol is much denser than carbohydrates or protein (which clocks in at four calories per gram), and even teeters dangerously close to fat’s nine calories per gram.
The antidote to all this is surprisingly simple — either ramp up your workout to counteract an extra 2,000 calories or drink less.
The Lifestyle
You’re going to get this a lot over the next few months from Recreational Sports or the guy down the hall who wants to play frisbee at midnight, so I’ll keep it brief: go outside. It is as simple as that. You are about to start four years in a city with the most stereotypically perfect weather in the United States. Take advantage of it. People who have to hibernate for three months in Michigan or the Texans whose shoes melt on the pavement in August have an excuse for sitting inside and channeling the sloth.
People living in Los Angeles do not. Go to the beach and go for a run. Join a soccer team and play outside in January. It doesn’t matter what you choose, just do something. You’ll find it’s easy to get stuck in the rut of class, study, party, eat, repeat and before you know it, all your high school jeans have mysteriously shrunk.
A final thought: College is short. Have fun. Relax. Weight is not permanent and 15 pounds will not kill you. That said, the Freshman 15 is not a foregone conclusion, and, with a little planning plus the right mind set, it can easily be more myth than reality.

As anyone who lives on or near campus knows, owning a bicycle puts you at a crucial advantage. Cars are impractical in such cramped quarters and walking is too time-consuming, leaving the simple, man-powered machine as the best option for those craving a stress-free commute to class.
Aditya Tannu | Daily Trojan
But bikes are more than just two wheels and handlebars. While they all serve the same basic point-A-to-point-B function, bikes come in a variety of forms, each possessing its own set of benefits and pitfalls.
Unfortunately, there is no “best” type of bicycle to get you through college, but there is definitely something for everyone, and because of that, USC’s bicycle population is as diverse as its students.
Below is a sample of some common campus bikes and what each can do for you.
Cruisers
If you haven’t noticed by now, cruisers are the most populous bike type at USC and it’s not hard to see why. In addition to affordability — basic models start at $75, new — cruisers have a comfortable ride that easily complements the constantly sunny Southern California weather. Their unique freewheel-style hub allows coasting, a padded seat gives sofa-style relief and cushy balloon tires make a ride down Trousdale  Parkway feel effortless — especially if your textbooks are in your optional front basket.
But for all their easy riding on campus walkways, however, cruisers are also victims of their heavy and cumbersome frame. Though great for slow-speed gliding through brief bursts of flatland, cruisers lack everything else necessary to ride long distance on streets, and owners are left stranded in the USC area.
Fixed gears
Though in the minority of bikes on campus, so-called “fixies” have a long history of helping people get around with their single fixed gear — when the pedals are moving the wheel is moving and vice versa — dating back to the first modern bicycle. Relegated to the velodrome track after the invention of the coastable freewheel, fixed gears have enjoyed a modern renaissance thanks to urban cyclists seeking simple as well as low-maintenance transportation.
In areas with no elevation change — such as those around USC — fixed gears are efficient transportation; however, those that choose to ride fixed on campus do so against practicality. They are hard to fit into the on-campus bike racks, their speed is unusable on pedestrian paths and their new-found popularity makes them targets for theft.
Road bikes
When the Tour de France started in 1903, riders switched gears by dismounting their bike and replacing their back wheel with one of a different-sized cog. But as bike technology finally evolved with the grueling sport of cycling, fixed gears gave way to cable-shifting gears and road bikes were born. Built more for speed and handling than comfort, road bikes have gone through several designs over the years, but all still bear the same identifying characteristics: skinny tires, track-bike geometry and curved-down handlebars for a variety of grip positions.
Today, USC is teeming with retired steel racers that are both cheaper and more durable than their modern carbon-fiber counterparts. But although they are ideal for students because of their ability to ride both cross-campus and cross-town quickly, road bikes unfortunately lack the shock absorption necessary to handle Los Angeles’ often-questionable urban terrain.
Hybrid bike
The word “hybrid” may most commonly be associated with Prius-like cars, but hybrid bicycles have nothing to do with electricity-assisted rides. Instead, they stand in the middle ground between road and mountain bikes, with enough features drawn from each to make it the most versatile type on the market. Available in many varieties — including the city bike and commuter bike — hybrids combine mountain bike durability with road bike efficiency to give riders a multipurpose machine that is ready for anything.
As the ultimate around-town bike, it traditionally pairs an over-sized mountain-bike frame with road bike wheels and always includes attachments for accessories like racks, fenders and panniers. By incorporating elements from across the bike spectrum, hybrids are a safe first purchase for students who are indecisive about their cycling future.
Folding bikes
Created shortly after the fixed-gear original and quickly appropriated by European militaries, folding bikes are enjoying a comeback as utilitarian commuter transport. Nowhere is this bike type more helpful, however, than on college campuses where bike racks are becoming increasingly more impacted and in-dorm storage space a luxury.
Small wheels and a low-to-the-ground frame might make most folding bikes look like a circus prop, but adjustable seat posts and extended handlebars actually give users the same general riding position as conventional bikes. Most collapse in seconds via hinge points along the frame, but this convenience comes at a structural price. Multiple stress points require thicker tubes, so even though they may be easier to transport and store, foldable bikes can weigh just as much as their full-size counterparts.
Good info. If you or someone on the DT staff could do a follow up/expose story on the Trojan revenue source for the city of LA – student bikers! Please list the typical citations given: riding on sidewalks, riding through crosswalks, wearing earphones, all at a cost now of OVER $200 per ticket. and – they typically do not mail you the ticket payment info. If they do – it is after you have moved out. But you are still responsible and then the ticket cost quadruples. They have a racket going on with the students of SC. Please warn students.
not the city’s fault if you’re too dumb to get your mail forwarded when you move…

To Tweet or not to Tweet? That is the question.
After signing up for Twitter, I found myself compelled to Tweet something as proof of my membership. With no followers, my first tweet in May 2009 read, “ah twitter confuses me,” and after a few more insignificant status updates that week, @Beccalett remained out of commission for nearly a year.
Regardless, I had made a baby step in the most important online frontier since Google. Now, being a USC student allows me to take advantage of all the functions on Twitter.
This is an exciting year for USC; in addition to the new school year and new freshmen class, returning Trojans have a new student union center, a new football coach, a new university president as well as new attractions and venues around campus. And all of this change is taking place in the heart of Los Angeles, a city that is undergoing reforms of its own.
In the epicenter of so much change, news becomes outdated as quickly as it is dispersed. Breaking news that takes hours to appear on Google, takes just seconds on Twitter. Google organizes and refines others’ content, but Twitter organizes its own, making the growing site more efficient.
For USC, Twitter is an incredibly powerful link to the metropolis surrounding the university as well as the microcosm within it.
Like many, I didn’t get the buzz about Twitter at first. Registering is fast, free and simple, but seeing Twitter as more than a source of  meaningless, narcissistic banter is difficult for some.
My ambivalence toward Twitter at USC changed when I rediscovered it as a tool for acquiring information and news. I now follow my favorite magazines, newspapers, shops, companies, professors, celebrities and friends on Twitter. My personal social media network virtually keeps me connected to Los Angeles from anywhere in the world.
I am currently finishing up my summer abroad in London, yet I still feel the pulse of Los Angeles. I am constantly reading L.A. news, Tweets, blogs and Facebook updates I conveniently receive daily on my Blackberry.
People use Twitter for different reasons. Whether you own a small business, are a USC student, an NBA player, Taylor Swift, Barack Obama or a stay-at-home mom, you can use Twitter to connect to useful sources, whatever those may be.
On a person-to-person level, Twitter is just a powerhouse for status-updates. For me, Tweeting is surprisingly therapeutic. The short, random thoughts I have a tendency to blurt out to anyone within earshot now have a proper time and place. It’s like a friend who is always available to listen. Who knew how liberating sending spontaneous thoughts and occurrences to no one in particular could be?
But with a combined user base of more than 100 million users, Twitter is a powerful source of live, interactive information.
While studying in Doheny Library for finals this May, I saw from the window that Leavey Library was being evacuated. The quiet study room murmured with wonder as to what was happening.
My first instinct was to check Twitter. I typed in “USC Leavey Library evacuated,” and instantly learned there was a possible bomb threat, which was being live-Tweeted by students in Leavey. The story didn’t reach the Los Angeles Times home page until after the scare had been cleared.
Many departments, schools and professors have accounts and use Twitter to share useful links and information with students. The career center at Annenberg Tweets job and internship openings daily. Campus media outlets Tweets news updates and links to relevant articles. This fall, most organizations on campus will use Twitter to recruit its members and promote their causes.
Twitter’s search feature is revolutionary, and as a student it has become crucial. I can search for anything I need to know instantly receiving a real-time feed of snippets of information, links and videos in real time.
During live events broadcast on television, what would have been a feature story or YouTube video the next day becomes a topic Tweeted by hundreds of users within seconds.
There is no other site on the web that has this capacity, not because of software, but because Twitter is fueled by an enormous organic user base that is continuously growing and always active.
The brain garbage Tweets about the sandwich you ate for lunch or the shoes you just tried on are just as important to Twitter’s credibility as hard news Tweets. Twitter can be a source of reliable opinions on products; you have the ability to directly seek more information from the provider.
And the more users there are, the more useful Twitter becomes. So get connected and take advantage of the free information that flows from this unique source.
So to Tweet or not to Tweet? There is no question.

The USC men’s golf team has never won a national championship. According to fifth year coach Chris Zambri, it is time for that to change.
“Our goal this year is to win the [NCAA] Tournament,” Zambri said. “We want to be the best.”
Strong words from Zambri, but not unrealistic. Last year the Trojans rode a wave of youth to a 15th place finish at the NCAA Tournament in Chattanooga, Tenn. It was their fourth straight appearance under Zambri. Starting three freshmen in their five man rotation, the Trojans consistently faced more experienced, veteran teams as they fought to navigate the second most difficult schedule in the nation.
“We try to play in the toughest events,” Zambri said. “I sometimes wonder if we should, but there’s a lot to be said for playing the toughest courses and best players.”
That experience will hopefully go a long way toward eliminating the inconsistency that plagued the Trojans last year as they struggled to play well throughout the course of the season.
Indeed, last year they never won a tournament, although they did succeed in racking up a string of top-10 finishes against loaded fields, their best finish a second place showing at the NCAA West Regional. That is something Zambri wants to rectify.
“We want to start off quickly and win tournaments. I think we can do that,” Zambri said. “We have a very good team, but we have to prove it.”
All-American T.J. Vogel is now in his second year with the team, as are standouts Martin Trainer and Sam Smith. They will be joined by junior Steve Lim, who was one of the few points of consistency last year for the Trojans, as he recorded four top-20 finishes in nine outings.
“I expect Steve to be a number one player for us,” Zambri said. “I’m really proud of his summer, and I think he could be an All-American.”
Lim and company will be joined by a pair of true freshman standouts in Jeffrey Kang and Ramsey Sahyoun, two of the top rated high school golfers in the nation.
Kang, who hails from Fullerton, Calif., received a spot on the 2009 Rolex All-American team and was the No.1-ranked high school golfer in the country last year, according to Golfweek magazine. Sahyoun, from Van Nuys, Calif., won the 2009 36-hole U.S. Junior Amateur Championship qualifying tournament.
Zambri said he expects each to step in and compete for playing time, as the team must replace a former two-time All-American in Matt Giles, who left the team after the end of his junior season to play professionally.
The Trojans look to have enough firepower to battle through a loaded Pac-10 conference in 2010, which features five of the top 10 teams included in the NCAA Men’s Golf Poll. Stanford and defending Pac-10 champions Washington pace the conference at number two and three, respectively, while USC begins the year just outside the top 10 at No. 11.
Thus, in order to achieve their goals, the Trojans will have to do the one thing they did not last year: win. And with a fresh infusion of youth in Kang and Sahyoun and the continued development of last year’s freshman class, this might not be out of reach.

It’s that time of year again. You trudge into the new semester, lugging boxes of clothes, furniture, stationery and assorted Old Navy flip-flops into a bare room, excited or not to start unpacking and decorating your new home.
Whether or not you call yourself a foodie, a more pressing matter is at hand — stocking the pantry and fridge. After all, one can’t survive on Subway sandwiches alone, no matter what Jared might say. For some of us, that means bulking up on boxes of ramen noodles and canned soups from Costco. For others, it could mean picking fresh heirloom tomatoes and five different kinds of cheeses from the farmers market. Whatever your choice of store, it’s time to go shopping.
Perhaps you are bored with buying the same items over and over. It’s a brand new year after all, so that calls for something more adventurous in the food department, and I don’t mean switching from chicken ramen to seafood ramen.
USC might not be located in a swanky neighborhood, but there are definite perks to living in an area of ethnic communities where certain ingredients are easier to procure. Consider Koreatown, just a 15-minute Metro bus ride away.
If you can’t read or speak Korean, it might seem intimidating to visit a Korean supermarket. But some of its traditional Korean ingredients can actually be easily incorporated into daily college cooking.
Take for example gochujang. Gochujang is a fermented red chili pepper paste, a ubiquitous condiment in Korean foods. In other words, it’s the ketchup of Korean cooking, and most meals contain gochujang in some form. It doesn’t matter if you butcher the pronunciation so long as you learn to appreciate the versatility of this red paste.
Gochujang has an intense, earthy and complex flavor — savory and spicy, yet slightly sweet, with a distinct pungency. It is certainly not for the faint of heart, but it also has an irresistible quality that leaves a lingering impression long after.
Think outside the box and you can use it as a flavoring agent to give your favorite dish a curiously hot kick. Use it as dressing for salads, marinade for grilled or barbecued meats and fish, dipping sauce for crudités, last-minute seasoning for soups, spreads for sandwiches and sauces for everything from potatoes to pasta to even pizza.
A little goes a long way, so don’t overdo it. Gochujang is best thinned out with liquids like soy sauce, broth, vinegar, sesame oil or even orange juice, and perhaps balanced with a little sweetness from honey or mellowed out with mayonnaise. It all depends on how sweet, salty or spicy you want it. You can also just eat it as is, mixed into rice or spread on raw vegetables. The best thing about gochujang is that it can last for an entire school year, so a small jar is a good investment.
The next ingredient is something most Americans are now familiar with: nori (or kim in Korean), those thin toasted seaweed sheets that wrap around your sushi. If gochujang is the Korean ketchup, nori is the Korean bacon. It’s crackly, it’s crispy and, despite being seaweed, it’s delicious, whether by itself or as part of a dish.
Nori comes in different forms, including dry-toasted, roasted with sesame oil, olive oil or grape seed oil, salted, unsalted or even coated with a sweet and salty teriyaki glaze. For everyday cooking purposes, stick to the plain dry-toasted type. That way, instead of dominating the dish, it accents it with a nutty, umami-rich flavor.
Just tear it up into little strips and toss it onto soups or noodle dishes. Use it as a base for wraps or topping for creative fusion pizzas. Roll it up with omelettes or sprinkle onto scrambled eggs. Toss it over salads and roasted vegetables. If you’re too hungry to get creative, just mix it up with cooked rice, a splash of sesame oil, soy sauce and a fried egg. Remember that nori can soak up moisture, so pair it with a bit of liquid, otherwise the dish can become too dry.
And finally, who can forget about kimchi? Certainly not the Koreans, who eat kimchi with practically every meal (I eat it with spaghetti). A college student of any cultural background can benefit from kimchi’s superb health and gastronomical benefits too.
Kimchi, of course, is what makes Korean food famous. It’s sauerkraut with an attitude—fermented, probiotic-rich vegetables, usually cabbage, seasoned with red pepper flakes, fish sauce, salt, garlic and more. Kimchi, like gochujang, is an intricate blend of sweet, sour, salty and spicy flavors, but with more substance and texture. Though they are raw, the vegetables have been softened by salt, which makes them soft yet refreshingly crunchy. Vegetarians and vegans, however, should take note that kimchi usually contains fish sauce or shrimp paste.
Kimchi can be used in a myriad combinations. You can pop it on a burger, scramble it with eggs, stick it into a quesadilla, fry it with rice, puree into risotto and curries, boil it into stew or melt it into a grilled cheese sandwich.
But do yourself a favor and try sautéing it with bacon. The marriage of warm, flavorful bacon fat and crunchy, spicy kimchi is all you need to convince yourself that  you need to buy a bigger jar of this Korean pickle.
Don’t let these foreign products intimidate you. All it takes is a bit of imagination and the courage to try something new. As you go shopping, remember to leave a little space next to your usual pantry items for a new culinary adventure.
I LOVE all your kimchi suggestions! Hubby is a big fan of kimchi. Me, not so much, but I don’t hate it either.
You’re BRILLIANT!
Thanks to your suggestions months ago, I finally tried kimchi.  Oh man, so delicious!!  Before that I just thought Kimchi was a name (I went to school with a guy named Kimchi).  Boy was I wrong.
Sophia, as a person of Korean descent, I disagree with kimchi’s “superb health and gastronomical benefits too.” It’s one of those kind of “panchan” or side dishes that you should eat sparingly because of its high sodium content. 
However, your fusion suggestions are interesting. 
@Caroline, ddeokbokki along with bimbimbap are my 2 favorite Korean dishes. Ddeokbokki can be eaten with meats such as fish cake or ground beef. These combinations taste pretty good. Some people add spinach, but I don’t like it that way. Just my 2 cents. K-town up the street has myriad Korean fast food places, especially Hyodori, on the SW corner of Vermont and Olympic.
Great article, Sophia :)
yay sophia! love this post!
Korean is probably my favorite ethnic cuisine–unfortunately, we don’t have much exposure to it in the Northeast. :(
The other day I made ddeokbokki with rice cakes and gochujang (recipe on maangchi.com)…I really recommend that those who like Thai noodle dishes try this dish. Korean rice cakes (found in the Asian market) have that gummy, chewy texture like the drunken noodles (and if you eat drunken noodles, you can probably tolerate the spice). It’s one of my absolute favorite Korean dishes, and I’m sure I have not had the really authentic version yet…that should be even better.

Of the thousands of strokes taken during the season across the country in practice and tournaments, one stroke impacted the USC women’s golf team more than any other. That one stroke was the only difference between the Women of Troy and Purdue at the NCAA Championships in May.  That one stroke made Purdue the national champions and kept USC from capturing its second championship in three years.
That single stroke gives the Women of Troy all the motivation they need for this season.
“It’s something you have to draw from” said USC coach Andrea Gaston. “The returning players will certainly remember what that felt like, and that’ll be passed on to the four new players.”
This season, the team has had to replace four of seven team members — the biggest turnover in Gaston’s 14-year career.  Departing with Jennifer Song, Belen Mozo, Stefanie Endstrasser and Caroline Kim are six All-American awards, 14 years of experience, two NCAA Championship rings and numerous school records. It’s up to senior Lizette Salas, junior Inah Park, sophomore Cyna Rodriguez and four new teammates to replace them without missing a beat.
Salas, the teams only senior and a three-time All-American, is the only remaining member of the 2008 national championship team. She earned five top-five finishes last season, including two victories and a second-place finish at the NCAA Central Regional tournament, and finished 27th at the NCAA championship.
Park looks to continue the improvement she made between her freshman and sophomore seasons. She had a career best 15th-place finish last season, before tying for 86th at the NCAA Championship. Rodriguez imprved as well, as she had a top-10 finish and tied for 33rd at the NCAA Championship in her freshman season.  Both players will have to take leadership roles for a very young team to have a successful season.
Immediately stepping in to replace some of those lost All-American awards is Pepperdine transfer Lisa McCloskey, a two-time All-American. McClosky kept busy after her 61st place finish at the NCAA Championship, reaching the final of the Women’s North and South Amateur Championships and making the cut at the 2010 U.S. Open, where she tied for 62nd.
Of the three incoming freshman, Sophia Popov has had the most notable offseason. Fresh off a victory at the International European Ladies Amateur Championship at the end of July, Popov is expected to immediately compete for a roster spot.
The experience the team has gained from competing throughout the offseason will prove helpful for a team that has only four players with NCAA experience.
“I know we’re going to have a really strong team, because the girls are having really strong summers and coach always picks the best,” Salas said.
As the players look to the season ahead, they said will remember the lesson they learned from that missed stroke in May.
“It’ll be a season about paying attention to details,” Gaston said.

Street Fighter II. Gamma Epsilon Omega. Spinning records. Though these things have seemingly nothing in common, they mesh to form the background story of up-and-coming band DDL Roundhouse.
A force to be reckoned with - Members of DDL Roundhouse show that having a multi-instrumental, multi-talented band only gives their musical work a defining complexity and an original personality. - Photo courtesy of DDL Roundhouse
For all you Street Fighter fanatics, yes, the band is named after the technically advanced hurricane kick in the game. But the band focuses not on creating music to match the classically violent arcade game but  on creating suave sounds that stream from speakers in a slur of trumpet notes and slick rhymes.
Rewind to the wonder years at USC, the sun bright in the sky and cars cruising by the house of Gamma Epsilon Omega. Inside the house, members of the fraternity held the first practices of what would later become a solid band. Mix in a family member and students from other universities in the Southern California area and you get the beginnings of DDL Roundhouse.
For band manager and disc jockey Barry Fernando, forming the band came naturally. Fernando’s DJ roots began in high school and continued through his admission to USC as an economics major, where he towed his DJ equipment to his new fraternity home.
Soon enough, other musicians joined Fernando and his talented scratching. Hang outs turned into jam sessions, and it was clear what the future would hold.
“The original guitarist, Justin, said ‘Why don’t we all just start a band?’” Fernando said.
Thus began the journey. The band formed with only a few members, and soon expanded to become a multi person, multi-instrumental, group.
With vocals from Chris Cruz, Mike Daniszewski and Erika Jaye, the band mixes clever and straightforward lyrics with the musical talents of Fernando, Rob Abergas (drums), Jason Agpalo (keyboard), Kris Musni (vocals/bass), Alex Messano (guitar) and Taylor Wheeldin (trumpet).
The band members also keep it authentic and close to home. Their most recent video for their track “Martini,” directed by USC film school alumni Derek Mio and Sheldon Schwartz, starts with a close-up of a man, the metal harshness of a subway train approaching him. The honey voice of Jaye starts off the song with the bouncing notes of the keyboard and the sly sound of the trumpet.
The video cuts to shots of the landmark Staples Center and Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Fernando’s spins come in with the rapper’s deep voice. The scene changes to people laughing without restraint, simple as can be.
Simple seems to be the vibe of the band. The members do not attempt to glitter themselves up or adopt alternate personas but instead use the purest sounds of their instruments. Listeners get a sense that the band believes only in the power of its vocals to soothe its listeners with a smooth tune.
Though many fans may see DDL’s various music styles as a recipe for chaos and stress, for Fernando, it’s one of the things of which he’s most proud.
“We all clash a lot in the studio,” he said. “No one wants to back down and that’s kinda where our sound comes from. That’s probably our strength as a band.”
As with any band, each member comes with their own musical history and opinions. Rapper and real estate finance major Daniszewski’s mother remembers a family party where the budding rapper grasped the microphone and dropped a rhyme about buying Pantene Pro-V at the supermarket. The rest fell into place.
“It took about a year of just meeting up at the frat house and jamming out and really learning how to play our instruments, including rapping,” Daniszewski said. “We didn’t know how to make a song by any means. Before we knew it, we had three.”
DDL Roundhouses possesses a knack for melding instruments and voices, with no band member outshining the other but instead working as a team to create a cohesive track that incorporates each member’s personality.
“I’m what I like to call a punch-line rapper,” Daniszewski said. “I just make people laugh and smile.”
Unlike most young musicians struggling to attain fame and fortune, Fernando and company truly enjoy what they do.
“We like to get our music heard by as many people as possible, and if it takes a major label, then that’s OK. But most importantly we want to stay true to our music” Fernando said.
With its own website, a full-length CD already released and another in the works, this unique band’s career is only starting to take flight.
“Some people have careers, some are really putting a lot into this band … but all of us go in there knowing it’s going to be a release from everything we’re doing,” Daniszewski said.
Even for listeners shackled to their favorite genre, the smooth voice of Jaye mixed with rap and rhythm cannot help but turn some heads. After all, the band does not self-impose a genre, choosing instead to incorporate all the influences of its members, ranging from funk to rock. Their new album, Connect, is now available on iTunes and was recorded out of Fernando’s studio in his Los Angeles apartment.
“We sold 5,000 copies off the bat,” Fernando said.
With practices once or twice a week and a couple of shows each month, the members hope to one day say goodbye to their day jobs and play music full time. Their journey helps to showcase the road from an idea to the formation of a full-fledged band.
DDL’s blooming career also gives inspiration to USC students, whether creating beats in a rehearsal room, writing the lyrics to a first song, or mixing the notes of a guitar to someone else’s voice. Passion is only the beginning.
Correction: An earlier version of this article mis-attributed three quotes to Barry Fernando when they were actually from Mike Daniszewski. The Daily Trojan apologizes for this error.
awesome band. great article. keep it up, everyone

Why head to Staples Center to find a two-time defending championship team, arguably the best player in his game and an unparalleled tradition? That team is right here on campus – the USC men’s tennis team.
As the new season commences, the preparations and expectations for the defending 2009 and 2010 NCAA champions are the same as they have always been.
“Having won the NCAAs two times in a row, I don’t think changes anything we do,” said coach Peter Smith.  “Winning championships is nothing new for USC athletes.  That is the expectation we have every year.”
During the summer break, many of the players have been playing in tournaments throughout the world.
As players return to Troy, the attention will change from a collective atmosphere – during the spring semester – to individual play throughout the first semester.
“During the individual season, there is less emphasis on working as a team, you want to focus more on how well you perform at the individual tournaments in the fall,” said junior Daniel Nguyen.  “When the team season comes around the corner, we now focus on the team as a whole and how we represent the university and team.”
The inevitable turnover of a college roster did not evade this Trojan team as two seniors moved on following the end of last season.
Jason McNaughton – who overcame several injuries throughout his career at USC – contributed in many key matches last season.
In addition, USC lost Robert Farah, the reigning ITA Player of Year who finished the season ranked No. 1 in singles and No. 3 in doubles.  Farah is currently playing professionally and has shot up to 225 in the ATP rankings.
“Losing Farah is a real challenge for our team,” Smith said. “He developed into a leader for us and he won so many important matches for us.  We hope that we can develop someone like Rob soon.  I think [junior] Steve Johnson can fill that role quickly, but the key is can we find someone to fill in for Steve.  Someone like [senior Jaak Poldma], Nguyen, or [senior Peter Lucassen] needs to step up.”
Veteran Steve Johnson, who played doubled with Farah, agreed.
“Those are certainly tough shoes to fill, but we have guys from last year coming back ready to step up and hopefully a few of the new guys coming in will come in and bring a lot to the table,” Johnson said.
The newcomers consist of three freshmen who show promise in keeping the championship tradition alive for seasons to come: Raymond Sarmiento, a Fontana, Calif. native who was rated second nationally in his recruiting class, Santa Barbara, Calif. native Michael Grant and Corey Smith. (he might be the coach’s nephew — can you ask the writer for more info on him?)
The focus for these freshmen should not be tennis as much as adjust to the college lifestyle during this first semester, Peter Smith said.
“I am not so much worried about their tennis, I know we can take care of that on the court,” he said.  “I am concerned that they will make the correct decisions off the court. The adjustments they need to make are going to be in balancing academics and tennis.”
Overall, Smith said, the experience of the past two seasons has ingrained in this team the ability to not concentrate on peripheral distractions, and the knowledge that the foundation for championship-level play is laid during the individual season.
“The biggest takeaway from last year is that talk and seedings are cheap, toughness and true confidence are the only things that really matter on the final days of the season,” Smith said.

After a busy summer of international competition that included competition at the U.S. and European swimming championships, both men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams return to campus looking to build on successful campaigns from last season.
The Women of Troy placed seventh at the NCAA championships in March while the men’s team wasn’t far behind, finishing 11th in the country.
USC coach Dave Salo said both teams expect to better those finishes this year.
“We feel confident that we can battle it out with Florida, Cal, Georgia, Stanford and Arizona for the top four,” Salo said about the women’s team. “On the men’s side, we expect to rise in the ranks to the top eight.”
Junior diver Victoria Ishimatsu, a two-time All-American, will lead the Women of Troy diving squad for a third season. Ishimatsu won both the 1-meter and 3-meter Pac-10 titles last season and was named the Pac-10 diver of the year.
“Tori continues to a consistent performer and this could be the year that she challenges for the top spot at the NCAA championships,” Salo said.
Junior Katinka Hosszu, a Hungarian with two Olympic games appearances and a World Championships gold medal to her credit, will compete for USC in the individual medley, butterfly and freestyle.
Hosszu won the 400-meter IM at the 2009 World Championships and finished third in the 400-yard IM at last year’s NCAA championships.
Senior Lyndsay DePaul, who grabbed second place in the 100-yard butterfly and third place in the 200-yard butterfly at last season’s NCAA championships, will help lead a stocked roster as co-captain.
“We are losing a really small senior class and bringing in a powerhouse freshmen class of some of the best recruits in the country,” DePaul said.
Presley Bard, a senior, finished third in 100-yard and fourth in the 200-yard backstroke at last year’s NCAA championships and returns as USC’s top swimmer in the backstroke.
“Our ultimate goal is to win NCAAs and our women’s team has a legitimate chance this year,” said co-captain Ellie Doran, who finished 22nd in the 1,650-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships.
The men’s swimming and diving team also returns several top performers from last year’s squad.
Clement Lefert, a Frenchman who holds the 100-meter butterfly record in his home nation and a 2008 Olympian, will be the Trojans top returning male swimmer.
Lefert, a sophomore, won the 200-yard freestyle Pac-10 title last season and posted a third-place finish in the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships.
Salo said Lefert will skip this year’s world championships to focus on his collegiate season.
“No one could ask more from an athlete than to give their undivided attention for the Trojan effort,” Salo said.
Junior Patrick White will combine with Lefert to form the conference’s best one-two punch in men’s freestyle. White finished runner-up to Lefert in last year’s 200-yard freestyle at the conference meet.
Senior Dillon Connolly, who finished third in the 100-yard breaststroke at last year’s Pac-10 conference meet, also returns to the roster.
Junior Harrison Jones will once again lead the diving squad, after winning the Pac-10 1-meter springboard title and finishing second on platform last season.
Veterans said the returning talent would greatly influence the program in the coming season.
“We can really go far this year with the talent and chemistry we have on this team,” said co-captain and freestyle sprinter Jeff Daniels. “We’re looking to break a lot of school records this year.”

Heading into the 2010 campaign, 10th-year coach Mick Haley believes the USC women’s volleyball team has the potential to be among the nation’s best.

“With the addition of our recruiting class, we should be a much better team — more experienced, deeper in talent,” said Haley, who has led the Women of Troy to two national championships during his tenure. “If everybody works hard and things goes the way we plan, we are going to be able to compete for a national title.”
The Women of Troy finished fifth in the extremely competitive Pac-10 conference last season, but despite making the NCAA tournament for the 19th consecutive year, the season ended in disappointment when USC was bounced in the second round of the tournament after receiving a tough draw.
This season, the Women of Troy must get off to a fast start if they intend to take the conference crown and Haley seems to be well on his way to ensuring that happens.
Haley was able to sign the No. 1 recruiting class in the country according to Max Preps. As USC looks to replace three starters, including two-time All-Pac-10 player Jessica Gysin, these newcomers will be thrown into the mix from the start.
Outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana was tabbed as the top high school player in the country for 2009, and is touted for possessing a thorough understanding of the nuances of the game. At libero, incoming freshman Natalie Hagglund will place pressure on senior Geena Urango in what should be the fiercest position battle of preseason practice.
Other freshman that could see plenty of playing time include middle blocker Alexis Olgard, opposite Sara Shaw and outside hitter Sam Hirschmann.
When the second round of conference games begin, USC hopes the addition of 6-foot-3-inch Natasa Siljkovic, who will be eligible in late October, will add another dimension to the team down the stretch.
In addition to the incoming class, there is plenty of talent returning for the Women of Troy, including junior setter Kendall Bateman — who led the nation in assists per set — and All-American junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter. Jupiter was the focal point of the offense in 2009 and figures to play a big role once again.
But the Women of Troy will have more scoring options than they did a year ago. With more players with the ability to score, the offensive burden won’t fall solely on Jupiter, and opponents won’t be able to focus their defensive efforts on her — something Haley acknowledges hampered USC last season.
“We need to have point production from Alex but it can’t be all on Alex this year,” Haley said. “Now we can spread the ball around a little bit more and maybe make her more effective.”
Throughout the campaign, USC will face a bevy of tough non-conference matches in addition to a grueling conference schedule that will prepare it for the postseason. After three tune-up games at the Galen Center, the Women of Troy travel to Honolulu for the Hawaii Invitational on Sept. 3.
The Women of Troy will face two teams who made the NCAA tournament a year ago, including the team that knocked them out — Hawaii. The second major test will come when conference play opens as the Women of Troy host rival UCLA.
But with these tests come additional opportunities to build on past experiences, which will become invaluable to the Women of Troy as they try to make an even deeper run come tournament time.
[…] After speaking with volleyball coach Mick Haley, it seems as though he is rather confident this year’s squad is in a good position to make a run at the NCAA title. Check out the Daily Trojan preview. […]

While most students were away for the summer, the reins of leadership passed to USC’s 11th president, C.L. Max Nikias. Though the transfer appeared orderly, the circumstances facing Nikias are not.
Jovanna Tossello | Daily Trojan
Former president Steven B. Sample had a remarkable run. His 19 years at the wheel saw numerous academic and athletic accomplishments, sound financial stewardship, exciting campus improvements and a significant rise in the ranks of prestigious universities nationwide.
Yet despite Sample’s brilliance, the worst thing Nikias could do at this moment is stay the Sample course. These are unsettling times, and Nikias has the obligation — and the opportunity — to put his own leadership stamp on the president’s office from the get-go.
As a USC researcher, educator, former dean of Viterbi School of Engineering and USC’s second-ranking officer for the past five years, Nikias has impressive academic firepower. He’ll need it.
Nikias will have to continue the push for the academically enriching environment he sought to cultivate as provost. A call for new scholarship programs that reward students, research funding for innovative initiatives in all majors and continued advancement in the arts and humanities — particularly the Visions and Voices program that he helped found — would continue to attract only top-caliber students to USC.
Next, Nikias must boldly confront the unique obstacles that continue to befall the university’s athletics.
The heavy NCAA sanctions imposed this past summer — notably a two-year postseason football ban and reduced athletic scholarships — extend beyond our student-athletes. The entire university’s public relations, fundraising and even faculty recruitment efforts could be negatively affected unless those in charge turn this heavy blow into an opportunity.
Nikias possesses the necessary enterprise to pull off such a feat. He immediately reshaped the athletic program by naming Pat Haden, a former Trojan quarterback and Rhodes Scholar, the new athletic director. Haden is also a businessman and former USC Trustee who knows the university well and could transform the culture of Heritage Hall.
And by appointing David Roberts, a distinguished attorney, to the newly created position of vice president for athletic compliance, Nikias is showing early signs of decisive leadership and an inclination to boldly move on with the future.
“USC … will seek to excel in the coming years in a manner that is consistent with the highest values of the academy,” Nikias said.
Among our higher values as an academy is our relationship with the broader community, one that cannot diminish. Los Angeles County is currently experiencing a 12.5 percent unemployment rate and a loss of 16,300 jobs in business and professional services alone.
Rebounding from one of the worst economic downturns in history, Nikias must somehow strengthen USC’s bond with the Los Angeles community and with alumni and institutions across the globe.
The fortunes of many businesses and USC partners have gone south. New businesses will eventually rise in their wake — businesses that will be essential to USC philanthropy and academic programs. Nikias will need to hit the pavement building new alliances, being innovative and reaching out to the new cast of post-recession leaders.
Nikias must also take the lead in the renovation of the University Village. As one of the largest construction projects in South Los Angeles — an estimated cost of $900 million — the renovation of the complex gives Nikias an opportunity to promote the project as a source for thousands of jobs and the lively college town that students desire.
This project is part of a larger dilemma: how to leverage USC as a positive force throughout Downtown Los Angeles, an area hit hard by unemployment, vacant rental properties and stagnant investment. It’s a daunting challenge. Nikias must play a key role in helping revive the climate of Downtown. A campus island, however well tended, will increasingly be at a competitive disadvantage compared to other, more social university communities in Los Angeles.
Ultimately, Nikias must be a leader of the future, not of the past.
Among the many Sample fans, some are bound to suggest that if Nikias just continued Sample’s initiatives and mimicked his style, that would be success enough. And granted, our new president could have been left with a far inferior blueprint to follow. But Sample himself would likely urge against tracking in his footsteps.
In his The Contrarian’s Guide to Leadership, Sample wrote: “If we are to raise up great leaders for our own age, we probably don’t want to clone the leaders of the past … [leadership] is highly situational and contingent.”
Especially in this time of drastic change and challenge, our faculty, the student body, Nikias’ administrative colleagues and the Trustees would do well to encourage Nikias to trust his own vision, instincts and creativity and to leave his own mark immediately. Let him never hear the words, “Sample wouldn’t do it that way.”

It shouldn’t come as a surprise that as a Los Angeles native and a USC applicant I was initially apprehensive about the ‘tired’ landscape that surrounds the campus. It wasn’t about safety concerns or about being too close to Mom and Dad, but the idea that in a metropolitan city, I’d still have to drive 10 miles to buy a shower caddy. Hopefully, though, concerns like those will soon become a thing of the past for applicants, students and faculty alike.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
The university has recently released plans for a $900-million upgrade to University Village. The plan includes a six-screen cinema, shopping center, 2,000-car garage, faculty office building and housing facilities that will accommodate 5,000 students, 250 faculty apartments and a 150-room hotel. Los Angeles City Councilman Bernard C. Parks described the plan as the most ambitious commercial development in South Los Angeles in a generation. Of course ambition seems like it could only benefit the area, but local residents are concerned that this lofty development will prove detrimental to non-university-owned real estate, traffic and small businesses.
I was drawn to USC for its superior academic programs, inspiring faculty accolades and the spirit and creativity that seem to literally spill out onto Trousdale Parkway. But it was an inevitable truth that on a practical level, USC was missing something. Other schools of similar size and stature boast massive theaters, pedestrian shopping areas and hoards of cafés where students and faculty can gather. Take Northwestern’s Evanston, Ill., Michigan’s Ann Arbor or, dare I say it, Westwood. When USC officials were drawing up plans for University Village with architects at Elkus Manfredi, a firm that long ago established its name in L.A. with construction projects like The Grove and the Americana at Brand, they were particularly inspired by the changes that have taken place around the University of Pennsylvania. Crime rates have decreased around UPenn, and shops and housing stimulated the lagging economy of the area.
Local residents who aren’t connected to the university are concerned that the University Village will depreciate real estate values in the area, which currently caters predominantly to the student population. Houses currently occupied by students, however, may open up for low-income families that are perhaps displaced by the student demand and the new shops and eateries may bring more jobs into the community.
Increasing the housing options will decrease the costs, making off-campus living available at more reasonable prices for both students and locals. Still, Emiliano Rios, a senior majoring in communication, pointed out that developers will have to navigate  a fine line between benefiting the community and usurping it.
“This kind of gentrification can be abrupt for families, and you can see it happening in other parts of Downtown L.A. with trendy restaurants and galleries moving in, and luxury lofts taking the place of family apartments,” Rios said. “I hope they manage it with class.”
This project is certainly in line with the revival that is gradually making its way Downtown. L.A. Live is a step in the right direction, but the thought of having an upgraded cinema and shopping area, topped with student and faculty housing all just across the street makes me want to give up my parking spot.
The most redeeming aspect of this proposal is its potential to further solidify USC as a residential campus.  Students will have the opportunity to live in adjacent off-campus housing that doesn’t hinder their ability to participate in campus life. Faculty housing gives more professors the opportunity to stay close to campus, which will improve their accessibility to students and involvement in the USC community.
If the possibility of increased traffic is what’s troubling you, remember that this is Los Angeles and that impending annoyance is about as ubiquitous as the smog we breathe.  Narrowing Jefferson Boulevard for the 35-acre development will actually drive the freeway traffic elsewhere and make the area surrounding campus more pedestrian friendly.
Giving South Los Angeles a more lively hub will not only satiate the USC students looking for entertainment and relaxation closer to their home away from home, but perhaps encourage people from other parts of the city to venture out to USC. Something tells me Trojans won’t mind taking some foot traffic out of Westwood.

“Local residents who aren’t connected to the university are concerned that the University Village will depreciate real estate values in the area, which currently caters predominantly to the student population.”
Don’t you mean local landowners/management companies? nupac, etc. That’d be a shame.

For those of you who want to jump from your few months of summer fun back into lives of political activism, here’s an update on the amendment to the California constitution known as Proposition 8.
Alice Li | Daily Trojan
The validity of same-sex marriage is a very emotionally and politically charged topic, so let me be perfectly clear: I’m not debating its validity. My argument is that California Attorney General Jerry Brown, and to some degree Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, failed to fulfill the duties of their respective offices by declining to defend against the recent challenge to the California constitution. Brown allowed his personal feelings about Prop 8 to impede his responsibility to the constitution.
Prop 8 was passed in November 2008 by a 52.24 percent majority and amended the California constitution to state, “Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.”
On May 26, 2009, the California Supreme Court, in the case of Strauss et al. v Horton, rejected the plaintiffs’ request to invalidate the amendment to the California constitution effected by Prop 8. The court instead affirmed “that Proposition 8 constitutes a permissible constitutional amendment.”
More recently, a new lawsuit was filed in U.S. Federal Court in San Francisco by two same-sex couples suing for the right to marry their respective partners. The plaintiffs named Schwarzenegger and Brown, along with other state officials, as defendants. On Aug. 8 Judge Vaughn Walker released his decision that Prop 8 “is unconstitutional under both the due process and equal protection clauses [of the U.S. Constitution].”
Now here’s the extraordinary part: Not one of the named defendants appeared in court. Defendant-intervenors (interested parties who wish to proffer a defense on behalf of the defendants) from the private sector instead shouldered the responsibility of defending the state constitution.
The oath of office taken by every elected official in California, including the governor and the attorney general, makes them swear to “support and defend  . . .  the constitution of the state of California against all enemies, foreign and domestic” and to “bear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of the United States and the constitution of the state of California.” Where was the attorney general for the state of California to defend the constitution of the state of California?
Though Prop 8 passed by only a slim margin, it was indeed passed, and consequently it amended and became an unmistakable part of the constitution.
Additionally, as public servants in charge of maintaining and looking out for the best interests of their constituents, the governor and the attorney general should have gone to bat for the desires of the majority, regardless of their personal beliefs.
“Barring a law that is unconstitutional on its face, the proper role of an attorney general is to enforce and defend the will of the people as manifested through the initiative or legislative process,” Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley said in an official statement. “The will of the people should be respected and not overturned easily or lightly.”
If Brown thought the law was unconstitutional, he should have attempted to address it earlier.
Until someone with proper authority (such as the U.S. Federal Judiciary) tells him otherwise, it is not up to the  California attorney general’s discretion to ignore his obligation to mount a vigorous defense of the California constitution. Deciding beforehand, as Jerry Brown did, that the proposition was unconstitutional was a neglect of the fundamental duty of his office.
After Walker’s ruling was handed down, Brown said, “In striking down Proposition 8, Judge Walker came to the same conclusion I did when I declined to defend it.” Brown, however, is not a federal judge but an attorney elected and employed for the defense of the state and its constitution.
Even while holding political office and bound to the same oath that he will affirm if he is elected governor in November, Jerry Brown shirks his official responsibility when it doesn’t align with his personal interests. Which laws will he decline to enforce as governor? Obviously the public will grant Jerry and his cohorts latitude, realizing that they have images to maintain and agendas to propagate. But California is in dire need of leaders who, unlike Brown, can put aside personal interests in favor of the greater good in order to extricate the State from its present challenges.
The constitution should be something that our leaders will invariably defend, regardless of how  it may impact their political futures.

This is a very good article. I applaud Reid Roman.  He was correct on the stated issue, regardless of his stance on gay marriage itself.
The commenters here are mostly letting their personal biases completely blind them to the fact that the author stated, and that “Ryan” nicely elucidated, that Jerry Brown is REQUIRED to do something that he chose not to do. That is not right, and it matters not whether you’re gay straight or utterly genderless. The greater good is to follow the Constitution, which when legally followed provides a remedy for the “tyranny of the majority.”
However, the fact that the commenters here are incapable of acknowledging that more than half the voters hold a different opinion of “good” or “moral” than they do is not promising for the civility of the discussion.
If California voters passed a Constitutional amendment, in the same way that they did Prop 8, saying that nobody but white males could vote any more, would you expect the Attorney General of California to defend that law?  I would not.  Why?  Because even though it would be part of the California Constitution, it violates federal law, and the state AG has just as much responsibility to uphold federal laws as he or she does to uphold state laws.  In this case, Brown decided to uphold federal law over state law (as he should, thank you Supremacy Clause) and, guess what, a federal judge agreed with Brown.
I am in no way letting my personal bias blind me to anything.  Here is, word-for-word, the oath of office that all California officials must take:
“”I, ______, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.”
Notice the parts about upholding the US Constitution are put ahead of upholding the California Constitution in both instances that the two are mentioned.  Jerry Brown and Schwarzenegger did their jobs admirably in this situation.
You clearly have a limited understanding of how our government works. Look up “tyranny of the majority” and understand how the Judicial branch was constructed to fight it. Jerry Brown owes nothing to that 52% majority of Californians.
You attempt to avoid taking a position on gay marriage, but it’s fairly obvious from your “greater good” statement how you feel.
Journalism fail.
The Governor and the Attorney General took an oath not only to defend the California constitution but also the Constitution of the United States.   Prop 8 violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the federal constitution and these official were right to uphold their oath by stating as much.
Ryan–
My point was not about Prop 8 specifically, it’s about what Prop 8 represents.  The author said that a politician must “put aside personal interests in favor of the greater good” and I was merely asking how this case could possibly apply to that maxim.  There is no “greater good” being served by Prop 8 or, as I said in my last post, by any law based purely on fear and hate.  Jerry Brown would not be doing his job if he gladly defended such laws, so by refusing to defend Prop 8, he was actually doing his job to the best of his ability.  Show me an Attorney General who defends a law that they believe to be unconstitutional and I will show you a bad AG.  I refuse to accept that it’s “disgusting” for an AG to not defend a law that they believe to be unconstitutional.
Now, if this article had been about the Democrats and Republicans refusing to come together in order to pass a budget, or about the gerrymandering of the state, or about ANY other subject where politicians are truly putting their personal and partisan interests ahead of the “greater good” of the state, I would have completely agreed, but this was a poor subject to write about in order to discuss a politician’s duty to fight for the “greater good.”
As the author mentioned, the purpose of the article is not to defend Prop 8. Nor does the author pick a side. For all we know, the author may be in line to marry a same-sex partner and is thrilled at the ruling. The fact of the matter is that the attorney general is supposed to protect the California Constitution regardless of his or her personal beliefs. Brown is not a judge therefore has no business interpreting California law. When Prop 8 passed just like every other Prop that passes, it became California law. It is Brown’s duty to defend Prop 8 just like it is his duty to defend every other California law. He failed to do so. There is no gray area here. Jerry Brown failed to do his job. Remove all mentions of Prop 8 and replace it with Prop X. Brown basically stated that he will only defend laws that he personally believes in. That’s disgusting.
“But California is in dire need of leaders who, unlike Brown, can put aside personal interests in favor of the greater good in order to extricate the State from its present challenges.”
How exactly is it for the “greater good” to deny people their Constitutional right to equal protection under the law?  If this law was banning interracial marriage rather than gay marriage, I highly doubt that you would be writing this same article–in fact, I would hope that you would praise the public official that would stand against such bigotry.  I would rather have a man like Brown, who is willing to stand up for the most basic protections that the US Constitution provides each citizen, than a person who would happily enforce laws based on nothing other than fear and hate.

Over the last 15 years or so, USC could be thought of as a growing empire.
Academic standards exponentially rose, campus expanded and some of the most highly sophisticated buildings found on any college campus were built.
Athletics were, without a doubt, the center of this empire, holding all the components in place. With revenue in the hundreds of millions of dollars pouring in each year mostly from sports (predominantly football), USC was able to accomplish many of the aforementioned    achievements.
President Steven B. Sample was theoretically at the top of the totem pole during this stretch; but with athletics running the show, the real king was Athletic Director Mike Garrett and his prince was coach Pete Carroll.
Over the course of his 17-year tenure, Garrett took an already noteworthy athletics department and conquered the national collegiate landscape. The men’s and women’s water polo teams built dynasties, while women’s soccer, golf, tennis and men’s tennis all won national titles.
Additionally, Garrett oversaw a basketball team that became nationally competitive and a football program that served as the epitome of dominance over the last decade. The only sport that seemed to move backwards was baseball — but that’s a story for a different day.
Garrett should receive some praise for building the Trojan army during his time. But ultimately, as we found out this spring and summer, a mixture of greed and arrogance caused his empire to collapse in on itself.
New Athletic Director Pat Haden recognized that it was the atmosphere of the athletic department that allowed illicit activity to exist by saying, “We’re going to do our best not to allow our players to be corrupted.”
Garrett is the number one man responsible for creating that atmosphere and deserves a lot of the blame. It’s because of his handling that USC is in this mess. As a parent and adult figure, he’s supposed to set the example that his “kids” look up to and he did exactly the opposite.
He’s the one who, according to reports, turned the other cheek when asking Tim Floyd of Rodney Gillroy’s involvement with O.J. Mayo and who, after the sanctions were released, told a group of boosters that the sanctions revealed “a lot of envy” and the prosecutors “wished they were Trojans.” He’s the one who only hired one compliance officer to oversee the entire athletic department.
To make matters worse, Garrett rarely spoke to the media, instead choosing to post video statements online — such as the one revealing self-inflicted sanctions on the basketball program last year. This gave his image a rough edge, as he was rarely available to answer questions, leaving people to speculate and make assumptions. He shied away from any wrongdoing, almost as if he believed that the world was out to get him.
So with Garrett finally gone, it’s obvious that an era has come to an end at USC. But with Garrett went Carroll. And Carroll shouldn’t be forgotten about in this whole mess either.
Thanks to his extremely motivated and generous charity work in Los Angeles with “A Better L.A.” foundation, his life coaching principles and overall likable attitude, Carroll has managed to stay immune to the backlash that has come with the NCAA sanctions. He has gained a Lance Armstrong type of invincibility — Armstrong repeatedly is able to stay in the public’s favor because of his unbelievable success story and his dogged work using his celebrity to gain attention for and help cure a fatal disease. Carroll has used many of the same methods to ensure his own favorable status.
But Carroll is intimately tied to the sanctions, and whether you like it or not, his legacy is undoubtedly tainted.
In the 64-page report put out by the NCAA investigation committee, it states that Carroll contacted a sports marketer, Michael Ornstein, about creating internship positions specifically for student-athletes (interpreted as football players). This violates NCAA rules because the report found no evidence that these positions were ever listed and made available to the public. In other words, the players were able to obtain these internships because of their student-athlete standing, and the NCAA really doesn’t like that.
So, Carroll did have some knowledge that something was going on (even though it’s not confirmed that his recommendations led directly to any internships). But that’s not the point. This interaction contributed to the biggest scarlet letter that the NCAA can stitch on a program: lack of institutional control.
I know that keeping track of 85 college students and making sure they are following NCAA laws to a tee is not exactly easy, but he should have kept a closer eye on Bush and others, including running backs coach Todd McNair, who knew of Bush’s misdeads. As head football coach, it was Carroll’s responsibility to oversee the football team. And he should have been running a much tighter ship.
I’m not saying that Carroll was a Mike Garrett-sized blunder at all. I think he did a lot of good things for the school and for the community. But he should not get lost in this whole mess, as, beside Garrett, he’s probably the person most responsible for creating an atmosphere with “lack of institutional control” that led to these sanctions.
Carroll might have won us a few national championships, but those now come with an asterisk. And so should his name in the history books.

California is at a crossroads. The state that was once a symbol of American innovation, opportunity and progress has become the poster child for the growing chorus of sages proclaiming America’s decline.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
National problems are magnified in California. Unemployment in the United States is at 9.5 percent; in California it is 12.3 percent. The state also boasts the fourth highest foreclosure rate in the country for 2010. Economists warn that if the federal government continues to run record deficits, debt will become unsustainable; in California it already has — the state has the lowest credit rating in the nation and a cost of debt lower than such developing countries as Lebanon, Uruguay and Kazakhstan.
Still, these problems do not necessarily spell doom for the Golden State. It remains a world center of culture and creativity, one of the biggest economies internationally and the home of an extensive physical and human capital. However, the self-perpetuating crises of a lagging economy and a structural budget gap threaten to render the state’s downward spiral irreversible if not dealt with properly.
USC students should be paying attention to these problems. Not only does nearly half of the student body come from California, but nearly three quarters of alumni have historically ended up living in California. How much economic opportunity we enjoy in the future depends on choices made by political leaders today.
The upcoming gubernatorial election should be of serious consideration on campus, particularly each candidate’s economic plan. Unfortunately, neither candidate can  be distinguished as the clear-cut choice.
At first glance, the question of who has better economic credentials seems obvious. Democratic nominee and current Attorney General Jerry Brown has far more experience, having already served as California’s governor. However, Republican nominee Meg Whitman made her name as chief executive officer of EBay Inc., one of California’s most successful Internet companies. Whitman is a businesswoman who understands the nuances of today’s increasingly complicated global economy.
Further, the biggest challenge facing the next California governor —balancing the budget — is one best taken on by somebody with a private-sector mentality. Brown’s history in California politics would certainly make him more skilled at navigating the entrenched interests in Sacramento, but Whitman can rightly contend that today’s budget problems were caused by an inability of the state government to say no to those very interests and what we need now is a governor who can ignore them. It was precisely the Jerry Brown style of politicking that led to the current mess, and there is no reason to suspect that he would govern any differently the second time around.
If elected, Brown promises to continue California’s disastrous policy of putting major tax or spending decisions to a public referendum, one of the main reasons why the state’s revenues never match its expenditures. It seems that only someone from the private sector like Whitman is capable of implementing the systemic change needed to correct the deficit.
Whitman’s policy proposals are also impressive. They center around sensible changes that could spur economic growth and reduce the deficit without disastrous consequences for key service deliveries like schools, prisons and maintenance.
Whitman’s plan focuses on three main goals: create jobs, cut government spending and improve education. Although her jobs plan does involve cutting taxes, the specific taxes that she has singled out make up only a small part of California’s revenues and are likely to spur growth if eliminated. She plans to eliminate the $800 tax required for new start-ups, the tax on manufacturing equipment that is present in only two other states and provide tax credits aimed at encouraging research, development and investments in new technology. Her proposal to change the state’s mandated depreciation schedule in a way that encourages businesses to buy newer equipment is one that could only have come from someone with a private sector background.
To cut expenditures, Whitman proposes implementing a strict spending cap tied to California’s gross domestic product — a necessary step. Further, she plans to bring a private-sector style of financial management to government with the establishment of a central financial management system that would eliminating some bureaucracies and streamlining others.
Finally, Whitman is giving education the attention it deserves.
In contrast, Brown has surprisingly few policy proposals designed to spur growth,  increase revenues or cut spending. According to his website, only one of his top 10 priorities -— clean energy jobs plan — is relevant to economic growth and despite clean energy’s merits as an investment for the future it remains a relatively small industry today. Additionally, only pension reform addresses California’s budget gap -— that alone will not be enough.
Instead, Brown seems intent on taking advantage of the anger generated by the economic crisis to address injustices perpetrated by big business. Admirable as this goal may be, achieving it will mean little if California’s government has to declare bankruptcy.
All this seems to indicate that Whitman is California’s wisest choice. However, there is still a third factor to consider: governing style.
Whitman seems to equate the position of governor with that of CEO. Her approach is to treat California like a corporation but this misses the crucial insight that the budget problem is persistent because its roots are as political as they are economic.
Brown, on the other hand, is all politics. He has been criticized for lacking precise policy plans but this reflects his understanding that the next governor’s range of policy options will be shaped by other realities, most of which we are still unable to predict.
In addition to doing the simple math of balancing the budget, the next governor will need to be able to react quickly to crises sure to come, navigate the hallways of Sacramento and address social issues like immigration and crime — all while taking measures to spur economic growth in both the short and long term.
To do this, the next governor will need to be creative, contrarian and willing to take unorthodox steps to put California ahead of the curve again. This is the area where Brown excels — a man who once insisted that his staff not repair a hole in the rug on the floor of the governor’s office so that he could use it to deny requests for money, he speaks often of “re-founding” California if elected.
While it is easy to mock Brown for responding to requests for specifics about his economic plan by saying, “The process is the plan,” in truth the response illustrates Brown’s understanding of not only the constraints facing California’s governor, but the necessity of fundamentally changing the way that California does business. Unfortunately, Whitman has yet to show evidence of the same type of thinking.
It is hard to vote for a candidate with no defined economic plans when the next year or two are likely to determine California’s post-crisis path. However, it also seems that Brown is willing to take bolder, more creative steps than his opponent.
Ideally, either Whitman will adopt some of Brown’s creativity or Brown will emerge with a clearer, more definitive economic vision. In the weeks leading up to the election, voters should watch each candidate closely to see if either of these developments materialize. If neither does, Californians will have a tough choice to make.

USC joined the Alcohol Prevention Coalition this summer in an effort to expand educational information and research regarding alcohol use by college students.
The goal of the Alcohol Prevention Coalition partnership is to further develop AlcoholEdu, an online alcohol safety class required for incoming freshmen that USC used for seven years.
The Alcohol Prevention Coalition, sponsored by Outside the Classroom, hopes to improve AlcoholEdu by researching and identifying new methods of encouraging responsible drinking habits.
“We hope joining the Alcohol Prevention Coalition will help USC keep up with the latest thinking and strategies about how to encourage students to use alcohol responsibly,” said Michael Jackson, vice president of student affairs.
Paula Swinford, director of Health Promotion and Prevention Services, said the initial task of the Alcohol Prevention Coalition is to implement two new programs: GreekLifeEdu and AlcoholEdu for Sanctions.
GreekLifeEdu, a program that is already being used by many nationwide fraternities and sororities, is targeted at students who participate in Greek life and addresses issues that are unique to those communities.
According to Swinford, this program focuses on sexual violence, alcohol abuse and hazing.
“The Greek council is really excited about this because it allows them to set an agenda and expectations with new members so that everybody gets the same message and understands the context of being Greek at USC,” Swinford said.
Though AlcoholEdu and GreekLifeEdu are primarily prevention tools targeted at students who have not had past issues with drinking, AlcoholEdu for Sanctions was created for students who have had negative consequences related to alcohol.
In the past, HPPS has scheduled one-on-one meetings with students who have had difficulty with alcohol or drug abuse. Last year, 280 students were referred to the drug education program.
With AlcoholEdu for Sanctions, students will have to complete an online course instead of having one-on-one meetings with faculty members at HPPS.
“What we realized is that there is a much more convenient tool online,” Swinford said.
In addition to these new programs, USC will now be able to participate in biannual research summits and communicate with other schools regarding issues of alcohol abuse.
“We will see what other colleges and universities are doing, share information and try out new ideas for teaching students about how to have fun, party and socialize without alcohol being at the center of these activities,” Jackson said.
Swinford said she believes students will be receptive to this new initiative.
“There are students in leadership that we have talked to about this and the general feeling is a positive one,” she said.
Jordan Merimee, a sophomore majoring in theater, said the most important aspect of creating this new program is making sure it is implemented effectively.
He said he believes USC should focus on the social aspect of drinking and how that can lead to alcohol abuse.
“AlcoholEdu doesn’t really express how widespread drinking is on a college campus,” he said.
Shelbie Bartholomew, a sophomore majoring in creative writing, said she believes AlcoholEdu provided her with helpful information when she took the course before her freshman year.
She said she is hopeful that by joining the Alcohol Prevention Coalition, USC students will be able to better understand the consequences of their actions.
“I don’t know if this will stop drinking, but it might keep people more informed about what they are doing,” Bartholomew said.
For now, these programs are the only scheduled changes taking place on campus in regard to alcohol education. However, Swinford said there is always a chance that new initiatives will begin in future years.
“We do look at our data and try to address the things that are unique to USC,” she said. “I let the data drive the next decision.”

Bike traffic — a perennially thorny issue on USC’s campus — is likely to be problematic around the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center and could result in a bike-free campus, according to Department of Public Safety officials, though DPS has not yet decided to start patrolling the area.
Traffic - DPS is searching for a solution to the high number of bikes that students ride on campus. - Aditya Tannu | Daily Trojan
Last year, DPS increased patrols around the university bookstore, placed signs forbidding students to ride bikes in certain areas and frequently stationed DPS officers in the area to enforce campus bike rules.
“I’ve seen on different campuses they have bike lanes,where people use their bikes on specific parts of the sidewalks,” said Daniel Wu, a senior majoring in urban studies. “But it’s hard to control because there are just too many bikes.”
There has been strong interest among students and faculty to reduce some of the issues the university has experienced with bike traffic, said DPS Chief Carey Drayton.
Last year, DPS created a traffic safety task force which aims to find solutions for the numerous bikes on campus that result in congested traffic flow.
One option that has been floating around, Drayton said, is for the university to go bike free.
“The idea hasn’t gone away, and there will still be discussion about it,” Drayton said. “The problem with bikes on campus is great … There are injuries that occur almost every other day.”
Short of creating a bike-free campus, the traffic safety task force believes it has found the solution: taking gradual steps to lessen congested areas on campus. Though the task force considers this a viable option, there will continue to be dialogue among students, faculty and the task force.
“I anticipate problems will occur and then [DPS] will respond and deal with real issues, as opposed to people questioning why DPS is bothering them when they are just going from point A to point B,” Drayton said.
Srinivasu Yerukonda, a graduate student studying mechanical engineering, said that a bike-free campus is too extreme.
“It is a big campus, so I think a bike is definitely necessary for students,” Yerukonda said.
Drayton has noticed the problem is not just the prevalence of bikes around campus, but it is also that students ride their bikes while heavily distracted.
“Students ride their bikes while listening to their iPods, holding a cup of coffee in their hands and, on top of all of that, they are holding 20 pounds of books on their backs,” Drayton said.
Though campus is crowded with bicyclists and pedestrians, some students find bikes are necessary to make the commute to campus easier.
“I’d be absolutely furious [if campus went bike free],” said Garett Figueroa, a junior majoring in business administration. “Most students, like me, live off campus and it would take much longer to get on campus if we had to walk.”
For students who live off campus, riding one’s bike across a crosswalk has become a point of contention between students and DPS officers.  Drayton said DPS is concentrating on enforcing safe travel across crosswalks instead of giving citations to students for simply riding their bikes through crosswalks.
“Bike riders should be cognizant of the fact that although the city of Los Angeles is not enforcing no bikes in the crosswalk, it is enforcing safe travel,” Drayton said. “The mere fact that you’re [in the crosswalk] won’t get you cited, but if you travel in an unsafe manner you will [be cited].”
This is really a sad commentary on how much USC administrators don’t understand or welcome bikes.  The number of bikes on campus is a great opportunity to create a bike friendly sustainable campus and improve the traffic situation for USC and the surrounding neighborhood.
I’m a city planner who works on bicycle and transportation plans, and who has founded a non-profit, Sustainable Streets, which offers Confident City Cycling and other classes accross LA to improve the safety of cyclists.  We have contacted DPS and administrators offering to work with students on campus to provide bike skills classes AND to work out a system to allow biking on campus while decreasing the pedestrian and auto traffic conflicts cyclists face.  USC has loads of room for improvement.  Please contact us at Sustainable Streets on fb or at sustainablestreetsla.org if you’d like to help make USC bike friendly.
Riding a bicycle in a crosswalk is not illegal in the City of Los Angeles.  Riding in a crosswalk, in and of itself, is not equal to “riding in an unsafe manner”.  This misconception is not, however, unique to DPS.
Last year I saw a student texting while he ran the stop sign at 34th and McClintock. He ran over a 70 year old woman who was walking in the crosswalk. She was bleding from the head and it looked like her hip may have been broken. An ambulance was required to provide medical transport to an emergencey room.  
We all see other students riding around as if they own the place. We as students need to be more responsible and we need to offer solutions to DPS or we may be walking on campus very soon. I don’t like the idea of a “bike ban” but if they see no other option they may do it. I suggest bike lanes and student judical affair citations.
Yeah, the real problem is that people are riding their bikes distracted, not that they’re riding bikes.  I remember last year a girl was on my right, talking on her cellphone, then turned left into me, causing my backpack to fall hard on the sidewalk and bang up my laptop inside.  Pretty sure it was because she couldn’t hear what was going on around her (and my bike auction bike is pretty noisy).
I hope DPS realizes that banning bikes outright is a horrible idea.

As the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center finishes construction, students and faculty members who have been in the building over the summer say that the new facility will undoubtedly be the heart of campus life this fall.
Look up - The new Ronald Tutor Campus Center features a new food court and study rooms, as well as offices for student organizations. - ames Watson | Daily Trojan
The campus center does not officially open its doors until its grand opening on Aug. 26, but most of the center has been accessible during the latter half of the summer.
“We waited two years to see it and it finally opened. People are pretty excited,” said Patty Trinidad, a staff member at the Viterbi School for Engineering.
Student organizations have begun moving into their new spaces in the campus center and visitors can now view the expansive Trojan Family Room or eat at the open restaurants in the food court, including California Pizza Kitchen, Panda Express, Wahoo’s Fish Tacos, Carl’s Jr. and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.
The outdoor patio provides additional seating for restaurant goers, which has received positive reviews from visitors to the campus center. The patio also connects the campus center to the newly renovated Student Union building.
“There’s more seating out here … You definitely have more options,” Trinidad said. “It’s just nice to have something besides The Lot to eat at.”
Despite the additional patio area, many have noted that the campus center is already getting busy. Alison Griffin, a junior majoring in psychology, said there are already lines in the food court, which could pose an even bigger problem when more students return to campus.
“On a busy day, in the middle of the day, I know that it’s going to be crowded,” Griffin said.
For students like Michael Soh, a sophomore majoring in civil engineering, the lines are already long enough to deter them from visiting during the day, when traffic on campus is at its peak.
“My friends and I get together to go at like 10 or something, when there are less people around,” Soh said.
Dawan Robinson, a senior majoring in aerospace engineering, said he believes the campus center is a vast improvement from Commons.
Commons, an older version of the student center that had a food court, mail stop and other department offices, was torn down two years ago to begin construction on the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
“When I think about Commons, it was dirty. The lines went from Commons to the shops. It was not a place to be,” Robinson said. “I feel like because there’s so much sitting space people are going to sit outside more here.”
Robinson said he believes the new campus center won’t just be a place to grab a bite to eat, but will also serve its purpose as an area for students to study and gather on campus.
“The study room is going to be open till 2 a.m. … That’s really nice because it’s in the center of campus. I feel comfortable here,” Robinson said.
Brent Stephenson, an alumnus from the class of 2003, said the campus center creates a place where students, faculty and visitors can socialize and interact.
“The outdoor seating is nice, the natural light and the green building there. The food court, I’m very envious,” Stephenson said.  “It’s really much more of a hub.”

While President C.L. Max Nikias searches across the country for his permanent replacement as provost, he only needed to look across the hall for a temporary one.
Filling in - Elizabeth Garrett will serve as the temporary provost of the university. - Daily Trojan file photo
This school year, all vice provosts, academic deans and the heads of many university departments will report to Elizabeth Garrett, who will act as interim provost.
Garrett worked side by side with Nikias when he organized a small advisory committee after he was appointed provost five years ago. She served as second-in-command as the vice provost for Academic Affairs.
Garrett also serves as the chief executive officer of USC Hospitals and will supervise a variety of other organizations, such as the Division of Student Affairs.
“I don’t think this [search] period means we’re not going to get things done,” Garrett said. “It’s important we not look at any period in our university’s life as one of stasis.”
Garrett, who received her J.D. from the University of Virginia, was a clerk for former Justice Thurgood Marshall on the U.S. Supreme Court. She believes her law background will be helpful when implementing academic policy at USC.
“We want to ensure students graduate on time and have the financial aid needed to attend this school,” she said.
Another one of Garrett’s main goals is emphasizing interdisciplinary learning. Last year, Garrett helped initiate the Academic Achievement Award, an award implemented this semester which enables students to take more units for the standard tuition rate if they study two different fields.
During her time as provost, Garrett plans to increase the university’s international focus, targeting places such as South America and Asia. A new position, the provost of global initiatives, was created to spearhead this effort. An office in Mumbai recently opened and a global health major was also introduced.
“Universities are the best places in the world,” Garrett said. “There are people with diverse backgrounds and interests and they come together to try to create new knowledge and train the next generation of leaders.”
Garrett said she believes the new administration won’t differ much from those prior, but it will be better because it can learn from those before it.
“Just because you’re excellent doesn’t mean you can’t continue to pursue excellence,” she said.
Nikias said he hopes to announce the permanent provost by late November or early December, but Garrett will assume full responsibilities until then.
“The committee and I are looking for a strong academic record along with strong academic values,” Nikias said. “It requires excellent leadership qualities.”
In the meantime, Garrett said she is looking forward to her new responsibilities.
“It’s a neat job because you really get to focus on lots of different things simultaneously,” Garrett said. “It’s making connections for people.”

The Undergraduate Student Government began work on many campus initiatives by meeting with administrators over the summer to kick off several of its school-year projects.
President Chris Cheng and Vice President Nehi Ogbevoen are setting out to make several improvements on campus and improve relations between USG and important departments within the university.
“A lot of relationships [with] some of the administrators had been lost in the last year or two. It was a big goal for us to build those again,” Cheng said. “It helped us prioritize what we want to do and we wanted to find out what kinds of goals [the university] wanted.”
These meetings led to several campus improvements already underway this summer, including  the addition of  bike racks and a bike parking lot near Parking Structure B.
Cheng said the bike parking lot, which he said should be completed by the end of the summer, will provide students with an area for safe overnight parking.
“That was a common goal between us,” Cheng said. “[The administration] doesn’t want the bikes kind of free-roaming.”
USG will also provide a monthly trips for students to venture off campus, inspired by the success of the L.A. Live tram — a project undertaken by last year’s administration.
“It’s nice to get somewhere around L.A. without having to borrow a car,” Ogbevoen said. “In October we’re going to Manhattan Beach. Once we told auxiliary affairs, they responded well.”
Ogbevoen said the implementation of the tram project was another example of why it was important for USG to communicate with university administrators.
“The advice we got from the administration was to start early,” Ogbevoen said.
The work has just begun, however, and USG still has plenty of issues to work through going into the school year. A $1 rise in the student programming fee, intended to cover a budget shortfall that was discovered last spring, has yet to be confirmed by the USC Board of Trustees.
“We actually created two budgets … We’re definitely ready for both scenarios,” Cheng said. “If we are fortunate enough to get that extra money. It will go directly to the funds that influence students the most.”
Cheng and Ogbevoen also began research on many issues they plan to begin dealing with at the beginning of the school year.
Among these is an improvement to the Lyon Center, a mission that previous USG administrations have undertaken. To get an idea of what changes they’d like to see at the Lyon Center, Ogbevoen and Cheng visited recreation centers at other universities.
“There was just more space — you can tell that they designed the building for students,” Ogbevoen said of the recreation center at Cal State Fullerton.
Overall, Ogbevoen and Cheng said they felt the summer was a success and are prepared going into the school year.
“I think the biggest advantage we had was meeting with all the administrators and getting advice from them,” Ogbevoen said. “All of them had a lot of input.”

As students finish moving into their apartments at the new University Gateway this week, they can look forward to new neighbors in the coming months.
Easy access - University Gateway, located a few blocks from campus, opens this year for student housing and several businesses. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
Officials said 16 non-housing units are scheduled to open their doors this semester at the new complex, located at the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa Street.
Matt Burton, principal of Urban Partners, the real estate agency overseeing Gateway, confirmed several businesses that will open on the first floor, including Yogurtland, Salad Creations, Seattle’s Best Coffee, JP Morgan Chase bank, STA Travel and Freebirds World Burrito, a 24-hour burrito eatery.
Burton said Urban Partners is in the process of acquiring two more restaurants. He was not able to disclose the names because negotiations are in the beginning phases with partners, but said one is a “New York-style pizza operator.”
Two local favorites, Subway and Soy Japanese Grill, will also join the dining options at Gateway.
Once these two eateries complete their move, their old locations will be replaced with other businesses, said Greg McCoy, the social media coordinator for Campus Apartments.
Along with the restaurants, bank and travel agency, Gateway will also accommodate a large 24-hour pharmacy.
Several USC schools will also have space in University Gateway. The Thornton School of Music will house a new 24-hour practice facility for music students on the first floor of the building.
This move, announced in late spring, angered some music students who will no longer be able to practice in the Music Practice and Instructional Center, which is now slated for demolition.
“I think everyone is kind of bummed that it’s not on campus,” said Will Sturgeon, a junior majoring in popular music performance. “But, it’s going to be great that we have a lot of space.”
The School of Public Policy and Development and USC’s Office of Real Estate and Asset Management will also have locations in Gateway.
Although the university has a presence within the building, Burton said members of the community will also benefit from the new amenities.
“I do expect lots of students as well as non-USC students to take advantage and benefit from all the new amenities,” Burton said. “Not only will it be a convenience for USC students but great for everyone in the surrounding area.”

Nineteen years after joining the Trojan Family, President C.L. Max Nikias is ready to hit the ground running this fall as USC’s 11th president.
High hopes - President C.L. Max Nikias, who took office Aug. 3, hopes to improve student life on campus, increase the university’s international presence and heighten security near campus. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan  
“We’re going to run a marathon at a sprinter’s pace,” said Nikias, who plans to bring USC to what he calls the “undisputed mountain top.”
Nikias, who took office on Aug. 3, succeeds former President Steven B. Sample, who many believe was one of the  most successful university presidents of the second half of the 20th century, said Kevin Starr, a USC professor of history and member of the presidential search committees for both Sample and Nikias.
“Of all the candidates, [Nikias] impressed us the most as having the ability to continue the high level of performance of Steven Sample,” Starr said.
Sample was Nikias’ mentor long before their time at USC. During Sample’s first year as president of the State University of New York at Buffalo, he signed Nikias’ diploma and watched him graduate with a Ph.D.
“The best way to secure the Sample legacy, is to take this great university and make it even greater,” Nikias said.
A selection committee of USC trustees and faculty members began the search for USC’s 11th president with 80 candidates, and worked for several months to narrow the potential presidents to seven finalists.
The committee searched for someone with a proven track record as a top administrator  role who understood the wide sweep of professional schools, said Warren Bennis, Marshall School of Business professor and member of the presidential search committee.
“Max came out on top of the pile,” Bennis said. “He understood the culture of the Trojan Family.”
As provost for five years and dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering before that, Nikias is well-acquainted with the Trojan Family bond.
“It’s not something you see or smell, but you feel it,” he said. “That’s really a great foundation for us to build on.”
As the father of two USC students, Nikias intends to increase visibility and maintain close contact with the students during his presidency. One of his goals is to hold afternoon tea with students each month to stay in touch with the student body.
“He’s a man of great personal charm,” Starr said. “I’m very proud of the person we chose.”
In 2001, Nikias was named the dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering, where his fundraising made him the only person in USC’s history to raise more than $250 million in four years as a dean.
“He’s an extraordinary fundraiser,” Starr said. “His financial skills are very important.”
In 2005, Nikias became USC’s provost and executive vice president, during which he focused on developing new scholarship programs for students who study in multiple disciplines and increasing research opportunities for Ph.D. students.
“The fact that I’ve been a USC parent, it’s helped me be a better dean and a better provost and hopefully a better president,” Nikias said.
Nikias’ overarching goals as president are to improve the quality of student life and add value to the USC degree.
“If you look at our equity, the only thing you have at the end of the day is our education,” Nikias said.
Nikias is the creator of Visions and Voices, a program designed to highlight USC’s dedication to the arts and humanities and provide students provocative experiences outside the classroom. He plans to elevate the international experience for students by weaving more international perspectives into the curriculum and student activities, as well as increasing the diversity of the international student population.
“Our ambition is really to be the university of the world,” Nikias said.
The new president plans to jumpstart an initiative to reach out to South America — a region that sends only a small number of students to USC by establishing high level contacts and recruiting international trustees at South American universities.
“It’s very important to really have a presence,” Nikias said.
On the local level, Nikias intends to continue USC’s outreach to the community surrounding campus. The university already has been recognized for its neighborhood outreach programs established by the USC Family of Schools, said Nikias, but he would like to work with local businesses to help in job creation and entrepreneurship.
Nikias would also like to improve student safety, he said. Although he was impressed with the 85 percent drop in crime since USC installed street cameras and Department of Public Safety command centers, he is confident that crime can drop even more.
“The real world is out there,” Nikias said. “They need to be careful. I need to be careful.”
One project Nikias plans to initiate as soon as he can get plans approved is to build a bigger and better student health center. Nikias projects 18 months of construction in the northwest corner of campus near the Lyon Center to make room for the new health center, he said.
Nikias, who Starr described as never too busy for the students, sees his presidency as an opportunity to amplify both the quality of student life and the prestige of the university.
“At heart, at the end of the day,” Nikias said, “I will always fight on for the best interests for the University of Southern California.”

The USC women’s cross country team experienced an up-and-down season in 2009, and coach Tom Walsh is hoping that better luck and a group of new contributors will improve the Women of Troy’s performance on the course.
“I think we can take a step forward,” Walsh said. “This is a competitive group and they are all looking forward to the 2010 season to try and improve.”
That improvement likely hinges on whether USC can stay healthy or not. Injuries and illness prevented the Women of Troy from running at full strength until the end of the 2009 season and contributed to some disappointing performances at important meets. At the 2009 Pac-10 Championships, USC could only muster a ninth place finish.
Most of the runners affected by these setbacks, however, will get a second chance. USC will return several key pieces from its 2009 squad, none more important than senior Zsofia Erdelyi, the Women of Troy’s highest finisher at the NCAA Championships last year. Erdelyi’s inconsistent 2009 season paralleled her team’s struggles, but Walsh believes the problems are a thing of the past.
“Zsofia’s season [in 2009] was a fluke,” Walsh said. “She got off to a bit of a slow start because of injuries and in cross country that can hurt you. The season is so short that if you don’t get on track early, you end up playing catch up.”
Among the rest of the returning ranks are sophomore Kathleen Moloney, who had what Walsh called “an outstanding freshman season,” and senior Christine Cortez, who arrived last year as a transfer from Mt. San Antonio Junior College in Walnut, Calif. and emerged as one of USC’s strongest runners.
Despite the solid group of returning runners, it’s the newcomers that provide the most reason for excitement. Redshirt sophomore Shelby Buckley, who was forced to sit out last season due to her in-conference transfer from UCLA, is expected to make an immediate contribution.
“We’re really excited about Shelby,” Walsh said. “She’s got great credentials. We can’t wait to see what she can do for us.”
Walsh also anticipates incoming freshmen Jaclyn Wallace and Katie DeYoung to make an impact. Wallace was the all-city runner-up in cross country at Venice High School, and DeYoung is a formidable long-distance runner from Serra Catholic in San Juan Capistrano, Calif.
USC still faces an uphill climb, however. In terms of overall dominance, the Pac-10 might be the best conference in all of collegiate women’s cross country. Powerhouses like Oregon, Stanford and Washington annually field national championship contenders, and the rest of the conference produces tough competition year after year.
Depsite a strong field of opponents, Walsh and his team aren’t backing down. The coach put together what he calls a “challenging, but not overwhelming” schedule that begins Sept. 11 at the UC Irvine Invitational and includes a trip back to the Stanford Invitational the following week. It’s Stanford that Walsh has circled on his calendar as a marquee meet.
“I’m really looking forward to it because we did so poorly there last year,” Walsh said. “We need to make up for that. It’s a very important meet for us.”
USC will also travel to Cal State Northridge and the Titan Invitational in Fullerton, Calif. before competing in the Pac-10 championships on Oct. 30
