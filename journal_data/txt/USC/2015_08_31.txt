Renowned landscape architect and assistant professor Alex Robinson spoke at the Roski School of Fine Arts Monday night on improving the infrastructures at the Los Angeles River and Owens Lake. Robinson, director of the USC Landscape Morphologies Lab, combines engineering and design to solve key issues.
According to Robinson, both the L.A. River and Owens Lake have outdated designs that have caused ecological issues. Given the issue’s close proximity to home, Robinson was challenged to create a plan to renovate the L.A. River through hydraulic modeling.
Robinson said the goal is to create a bridge between restoration and ecological restoration. The river was not visted by L.A. residents regularly. Robinson mentioned that the river is currently known for car racing and photoshoots.
The plan for the L.A. River is to build effective infrastructure by using aesthetics and water to create a more inviting landscape.
Robinson and his team used hydraulic modeling to show possibilities for the design and the flow of the river, which include a grass sports fields, river trail walks and kayaking.
Brendan Shea, an adjunct professor at the School of Architecture, said Robinson’s project seems sound.
“It is an interesting plan that seems well-researched,” Shea said. “I am most interested in how the technology starts to incorporate a larger discussion on the cultural value of the designs.”
Zeek Magallanes, a third-year student in the Landscape Architecture Master of Landscape Architecture and Urbanism program, said that the restoration project shows the impact landscape architecture can have on unkept areas of the city.
“[The restoration project] shows the creativity and the breadth of focus that landscape architecture can take in addressing social, ecological, economic issues and problems,” Magallanes said.
The attraction that Magallanes would like to see at the renovated river would be a “splash zone” in order to create a family atmosphere.
Robinson has said he wants to have citizens play a role in the design of these restoration projects.
“My idea for the lake is marginal in regards to what the people want,” Robinson said. “You have to design in such a way that you don’t break the bank, but also make something beautiful.”
Robinson was also challenged to take on another project in the Sierra Nevada mountain range.
Owens Lake is the flat site of a large-scale dust pollution issue due to salt crust that was left after the lake dried up. Similar to the L.A. River, Owens Lake is currently not a family attraction, but rather a wasteland with little vegetation.
Robinson’s goal is to use engineering technology to create infrastructure to mitigate the dust pollution issue. His plans for restoration and building high performance landscaping infrastructure are made possible through new programs and technology.
Robinson uses a program that creates a model of the terrain, and with the copy, he is able to insert it into a machine that resembles an arcade game — a process he calls “play.”
“Play” entails customizing the terrain with green landscape and attractions and then printing a postcard of the creation.
This technology makes it easier to visualize the possible outcomes of the area.
The public is then able to see these postcards and vote on their favorite landscape.
Jin Chen, a second-year master’s student in the landscape and architecture program and a student of Robinson, said she admires how Robinson plans his projects.
“It is very cool that he’s combining technologies these days and challenging the borders of what landscape architects can do,” Chen said.
Robinson is soon leaving USC in order to work on landscaping in Rome, Italy. However, he will still be working on his L.A. River and Owens Lake projects.
Robinson said his goal in all of his projects is to make urban spaces more inviting.

The Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab housed in the Marshall School of Business recently named Martine Singer, president and CEO of Para Los Niños, a senior fellow. Singer will work with students in the lab as a mentor and career resource.
The BSEL, established in 2008, works with Marshall students to address social issues with business practices. Singer’s background with PLN, a nonprofit dedicated to academic access and opportunities for children living in poverty in the Los Angeles area, provides expertise in the field.
“The Los Angeles Times ran an editorial about children playing on skid row in broken glass and feces-filled areas,” said Patrick Sinclair, vice president of development and Communications for PLN. “A social worker and an actress read that article and decided to do something about it.”
Founded in 1980, PLN worked to bring various facilities, including eight charter preschools and social work facilities to the metro area — all serving the purpose of helping low-income children receive an education.
Singer has worked with PLN since 2012, but has a diverse and unique background. Her work at Hollygrove, an L.A. nonprofit dedicated to helping at-risk children and their families, oversaw a transformation from primarily community-based services to a merger with a statewide organization.
“I began as a tutor and eventually got to know the woman who was running the organization and found that I had skills that would be helpful from my experience doing consulting,” Singer said.
Singer did not always work for the nonprofit sector. With an M.B.A. from the Yale School of Management, as well as past work with The New York Times and the L.A. Times, she perfected the art of utilizing skills from one sector in another.
“The expectation [at the Yale School of Management] was that you would cross-fertilize going from one sector to the other,” Singer said. “I think that’s turned out to be very true. You’re a better nonprofit leader having had experience in another space. When you work only in the business sector, you don’t necessarily have an appreciation for the social impact of the work you do.”
Sinclair agrees that Singer’s ability to synthesize her business background with an innovative outlook will make her a great mentor and career resource for Marshall students.
“She’s extremely creative,” Sinclair said. “In a world like this, where you’re dealing with acute problems in dealing with families and children or huge bureaucratic snafus because you’re dealing with county agencies and things like that, Martine is good at either finding ways around the obstacles to better serve the families and the children or to find ways to get the agency to meet the needs we’re trying to meet.”
Today, Singer’s duties as president and CEO include managing a $32 million budget, planning the restructuring activities necessary to turn a social services agency into an education provider and engaging the community in educational awareness programs among various other functions. She acknowledged the many challenges faced in the nonprofit sector.
“Resources are always tight in nonprofits,” Singer said. “Not just money, but time — everyone is stretched really thin. I don’t think a lot of nonprofit leaders necessarily have the experience in business to give them the confidence to do something like this. Sometimes there is a lack among leadership of deep understanding of business.”
Singer said she believes a business background and experiences like the social enterprise lab bring special insight and problem-solving skills to such challenges.
“It gives [students] insight into the practical application of what they’re learning,” Singer said. “It gives them the opportunity to operationalize some of the things that they might be studying in a classroom environment. It’s a way of seeing things come to life.”
For students interested in pursuing social entrepreneurship, Singer offered some advice.
“They need to get some practical experience as interns or volunteers at non-profit [organizations],” she said. “They can bring a tremendous level of innovation and energy to a sector that isn’t necessarily always considered the most creative or the most entrepreneurial. They have a lot to offer if they can find a way in.”

In light of a four-year drought and mandatory water use restrictions imposed earlier this year by Gov. Jerry Brown, USC administration and student groups are working closely together to cut campus water use.
But at a university with more than 30 fountains and lush greenscapes, cementing behavioral changes in students, faculty and staff has proven to be the campus’ biggest roadblock.
“Water conservation is something we’re struggling with immensely from a community point of view,” said Ahlia Bethea, director of the Environmental Student Assembly.
The university’s biggest water hogs are residential halls, campus buildings and laboratories, according to the Office of Sustainability. ESA is working with the sustainability office and Student Affairs to launch a campaign this semester targeting Trojan water waste.
The effort hopes to curb abuses such as excessive showers and sinks left on.
“I’m a residential advisor and people are taking 10 minute showers [and] leaving their water running,” Bethea said. “If they were more aware of the consequences, they’d be less inclined to leave that tap on.”
Students and other campus visitors aren’t the only ones being told to cut back — USC administration will soon be getting its own set of instructions from the campus’ Water Conservation Task Force. Formed last June to advise senior administration on water usage and reduction targets, the group will be providing recommendations to individual university departments in the coming weeks.
Shawn Anthony Rhoads, a senior and former director of the ESA serves as an undergraduate representative on the task force. Though a large focus of the group is curbing campus buildings’ water usage, he said the university should make a concerted move to switch out its green spaces for more drought-tolerant options.
“There’s no reason why USC needs grass,” Rhoads said. “We don’t need greenscape. Our university could look just as beautiful with native plants.”
USC administration has shared Rhoads’s concern with landscape converting initiatives to an extent.
“[Facilities Management Services] has been converting a lot of spaces into drought—resistant areas,” said Halli Bovia, the director of the Office of Sustainability. “Shrubs in place of turf, some native but mostly drought tolerant.”
The campus’ fight against water waste first began a few years ago, and since then the University has reduced its usage by 14 percent per square foot.
USC efforts have only risen since then, due in no small part to state and city mandatory reductions. It’s a shift in focus lauded by campus environmental activists as a change that is long overdue.
“The problem is that water is really cheap, so it hasn’t been the focus of colleges until fairly recently,” Bovia said.
In addition to working with the ESA, Bovia’s team just finished surveying roughly 3,500 water fixtures on campus to identify which ones could be upgraded and what savings could be made.
It is little actions like these that prove to be more effective, Bovia said, than more symbolic gestures, such as draining the fountains. USC’s nearly three dozen fountains get the most audible flack from students and visitors who see them as a symbol of water waste, but those complaints may be unwarranted. The fountains constitute only 2 percent of USC’s water usage and use recirculated water.
“There’s an aesthetic benefit to the fountains, and even though they use 4.4 million gallons roughly annually, it’s only 2 percent,” Bovia said.  “Students don’t understand that water is recirculated, they just think it’s a hose running.”
Beyond USC’s gates, California is listening to the call to cut back. Announced last Thursday, the Golden State had a 31 percent statewide reduction—exceeding Brown’s 25 percent mandate.
Now, university administration hopes USC will continue that trend.
“We’re on the right track,” Bethea said. “But we can obviously do more.”

Abigail Gregg and Laura Wang, two alumnae of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, became the first USC graduates to receive J. William Fulbright-Hillary Rodham Clinton Fellowships, landing them professional placements as special assistants to foreign ministries.
The Fulbright-Clinton Fellowship is a part of the Fulbright United States Student Program, through which scholars gain hands-on experience working in foreign countries’ private sectors while also doing academic research.
“The Fulbright-Clinton Fellowship is significant because it’s a rare opportunity to assist in a foreign government building skills and acquiring knowledge, but also to serve as an ambassador of the U.S.,” said Katie Calvert, associate director of Academic Honors and Fellowships at USC.
Calvert said the selection of Gregg and Wang was an honor for the University as well.
“Having two USC alumnae chosen for this competitive award speaks to the caliber of our students’ work and the importance of aligning U.S. policy goals with the goals of foreign countries,” she said.
Both Gregg and Wang will be journeying to the Pacific to complete their assignments. Wang, who graduated from USC in 2012 with a bachelor’s degree from the Gould School of Law and a master’s degree in environmental science from Dornsife will be traveling to the Polynesian nation of Samoa for 10 months to assist the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment with climate issues.
“Funding means finding a way to mobilize all these existing resources to best benefit my country of placement and that’s what I’m hoping to do over the next year,” Wang told USC News.
Wang became interested in climate problems while she was a Dornsife student. She participated in a Problems without Passports program in Guam and Palau that explored marine conservation. Wang later conducted research with the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies and interned for the White House Counsel on Environmental Quality.
Gregg, who earned a bachelor’s degree in both anthropology and English from Dornsife in 2013, will travel to Timor-Leste, a Southeast Asian nation. She is working as a special assistant for the Ministry of Social Solidarity with a focus on natural disaster risk and preparedness. Gregg hopes to discover options for conversation and resilience initiatives.
Gregg said she also looks forward to her position as a Fulbright-Clinton Fellow in Timor-Leste.
“Timor-Leste is a very young country,” Gregg said. “[It has] both a government and a civil society that are passionate about realizing the country’s full potential. I’m very interested to see how the government is balancing this drive and optimism with the everyday realities of caring for its citizens.”
Gregg’s experience started in South Los Angeles studying food security and environmental health and its impact on the community. She participated in a number of overseas programs while at Dornsife, including a PWP program in Cambodia and an independent study project in Brazil.
Gregg is in Timor-Leste focusing on improving preparedness for natural disasters in conservation areas.
“I became interested in disaster risk through my involvement in environmental management and conservation,” Gregg said. “Protecting an environment has as much to do with protecting the people in it as the flora and other fauna.”
Gregg explained how USC has played a significant role in helping her accomplish her career goals.
“My time at USC opened up the rest of the world to me and gave me a lot of opportunities to become involved in research both in L.A. and abroad,” Gregg said. “A number of faculty — Lanita Jacobs in Anthropology and American Studies and Ethnicity in particular — really encouraged me to get out and engage with my academic interests in the real world and made sure I had the support and knowledge I needed to do so.”
Gregg also talked about her plans going forward.
“Right now, my focus is entirely on my Fulbright-Clinton fellowship,” Gregg said. “I spent my summer working as a research fellow for the Advanced Consortium on Cooperation, Conflict and Complexity at Columbia’s Earth Institute. Post-Fulbright, I would like to continue working on the intersection of environmental management and crisis response, either in the U.S. or abroad.”

As the fall semester commences, the laid back nature of “syllabus week” contradicts with the building anxiety for the rest of the semester. For seniors, it’s also a reminder that graduation is edging closer and that the best years of our lives are almost over. As I begin my final semester at USC, I can’t help but think back to those words and wonder if I can stand behind them: the best years of my life. College is an opportunity to utilize personal growth as a measurement for success.
It might be the fact that I’m an out-of-state student, but the combination of everyone around me telling me college was life’s high point and moving to sunny Southern California gave me inexplicably high expectations before my freshman year. As much as I tried to fight it, I allowed the fantasies of what college was like in the movies to take over my image of what the next four years of my life would be like: all-nighters, fraternity parties, movie nights with people who would become my “lifelong friends,” stories I’d keep from my children and endless trips to the beach. I believed that college was my gateway to freedom but soon realized that the majority of the time you are living through someone else’s vision. I felt obligated to alter who I was to please everyone. I spent my freshman year agreeing with everything and allowing others to fall back on me at their convenience, even when it inconvenienced me, so I could maintain my reputation as a “chill girl.” On top of this, I displayed my best acting on breaks back home ,convincing my friends that my college social life was off the charts and bearing the interrogations from family members about what I wanted to do when I graduated. During my sophomore year, I chose my emotional stability over society’s image of success.
While having a fresh start can be exciting and a chance to reinvent yourself, it can also be terrifying.  The immediate question you’re faced with each year is, “Where am I going to fit in?” You’re exposed to so many choices, but what you fail to tell others is that freedom of choice lies outside of classes you want to take and clubs, organizations or houses you want to join. Freedom of choice also means breaking out of high school habits and the idea that you have to “fit in” to survive. It invites the opportunity to become more open to new things and to act on your own interests.
No one wants to become an adult because of all of the responsibility that comes with it, but one perk of being an adult is the opportunity to take charge of your own life. You don’t have to be friends with people you don’t like. You can binge-watch Netflix. You can say “no” or “yes” and are not obligated to explain anything to anyone but yourself. You also find out that not everyone has the same mind or heart that you do. You will find yourself disappointed. You will find yourself discouraged. You will find yourself lonely. And that’s okay because you also have the choice to change those aspects of your life. It’s always easier said than done, but it’s better to know there are always alternatives than to make the mistake and assume “that’s just how things are supposed to be.”
It’s a different age, and it’s easy to get wrapped up in fulfilling that fantasy of college life, especially when we’re constantly aiming to post the perfect Instagram picture or share something that gets a lot of likes on Facebook. On a day when we’re feeling down, pictures on social media become how we measure our lives. We all think about it at some point or another, whether we want to admit it or not, but we cannot let these things become a daily mental battle. It sounds childish to some, but this is a reality. We all want to feel seen and appreciated and there are various ways people choose to go about doing this. The territory becomes dangerous, however, when we start making our decisions based on how it will appeal to others.
As a senior, the most important decision I made in my college career was to take control of my life in the face of what everyone else wanted for me. I let go of a lot of toxic friendships, I began to explore spheres in which I could utilize my voice, I started meditating and journaling my experiences to relieve stress and, most importantly, I decided that I was OK with not knowing what I want to do after I graduate. I knew that I wanted to look back on college as a good experience and for that to come true, I needed to be a participant in my own journey. Though I wouldn’t change anything that has happened to me in these four years, I know that I would have loved to have someone tell me that things aren’t always going to be OK, but that doesn’t make me abnormal. Now, I aim to use this space to encourage others to find their own path, regardless of their circumstances, and to know that in whatever they’re experiencing, they don’t have to be alone. The people we keep in our social circles just want the best for us, but sometimes you just have to say, “I’m doing this for me.” So, these four years go by quickly and they’re the best of your life . . . If you make them.

Each year, the MTV Video Music Awards receive excitement before the show because something shocking happens every year. From Kanye West famously grabbing the mic from Taylor Swift during her attempted acceptance speech to Miley Cyrus twerking on a then-married Robin Thicke, something always goes down at the VMAs. At this year’s awards ceremony, there was no shortage of shockwaves sent through social media during the broadcast. Here are the top five moments from the 2015 ceremony.
1. Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj performed together.
When the nominations for the 2015 VMAs were released, Taylor Swift blew up the nominations as expected — she’s had a killer year with the acclaimed release of 1989 and the subsequent high-profile tour for the album. Nicki Minaj received three nominations but seemed pretty peeved at not being nominated for Video of the Year. She went on a Twitter rant in what originally seemed to be pointing out issues with black artists not getting proper recognition at the VMAs, but her comment about “skinny girls” being constantly nominated caused people to think she was throwing jabs at Swift. Swift and Minaj then engaged in a misunderstanding over social media, with Swift offering to have Minaj join her on stage and Minaj trying to get people to realize she wasn’t talking about Swift at all. Both artists have tremendous fan bases, so the so-called feud quickly took over people’s social media.
However, both Minaj and Swift were able to work out their issues as Minaj gave an interview a few days later confirming that she and Swift had talked it out over the phone and Swift had apologized to her. Both artists opened the show for this year’s VMAs, in a very red and carnival-esque performance, collaborating both of their songs. At the end, both hugged and smiled at each other and stated their love and admiration for each other on Twitter.
2. Nicki Minaj calls out Miley Cyrus and the world was there for it.
Nicki Minaj may go down in history for thanking her pastor and then proceeding to curse out Miley Cyrus, all in one minute. At the end of her acceptance speech for “Best Hip-Hop Video” for the butt-shaking song “Anaconda,” Minaj turned the tables and called out host Miley Cyrus, saying: “And now, back to this b*tch who had a lot to say about me the other day in the press — Miley, what’s good?” The camera then panned to Cyrus, who looked shocked, but Minaj, whose mic was cut off, was still yelling at her. Transcriptions later showed her to be repeating at Cyrus, “What’s good?” and “Don’t play with me!” Minaj’s anger was directed toward an interview that Cyrus recently gave, in which she stated her opinion on the aforementioned Swift and Minaj squabble, essentially saying that Minaj’s original message about racial issues was misdirected into a sob story about not being nominated for Video of the Year, which Cyrus won last year. Though Cyrus appeared surprised that Minaj called her out, she only stumbled for a bit in her response and turned right back to hosting the show. Social media, however, has blown up due to the feud, with many siding with Minaj and calling her their “new aesthetic.”
3. Kanye West being… Kanye
Kanye West will likely always be known as one of the more controversial rappers of his time. He’s been known for being a sore loser when he and other artists (read: Beyoncé) have been “wronged” by not receiving certain awards. The majority of his voiced frustration has been toward MTV, so it was a pleasant surprise when it was announced that he would be awarded the Video Vanguard Award. West certainly deserves it as his talent is undeniable and his performances are riveting. Taylor Swift presented the award to West, and the ceremony hit a sweet note when she joked about their previous feud, signaling that everything is now in the past.
But, of course, that wasn’t the end of Kanye. During his acceptance speech, he not only announced that he was running for president in 2020, but also spoke about how cutthroat award shows can be and showed love for all artists. Not surprisingly, his rambling speech went on for about 12 minutes.
4. Justin Bieber’s hair and tears
Justin Bieber has had a strange year. He’s released some new music, modeled for Calvin Klein underwear and seemingly stayed out of trouble. He had two major moments at the VMAs, the first being his mullet-like hairstyle. However, that wasn’t the end of the night for Bieber — he performed in what seemed to be a “comeback,” though it’s been less than two years since he released an album. He showed raw emotion after performing, and the audience gave him a standing ovation.
5. The Weeknd ignites the crowd
After an incredibly awkward introduction by actor Jared Leto, the Weeknd re-created his fiery video for “I Can’t Feel My Face.” Though the artist looked bored during the award ceremony, he regained his energy around a ring of fire on stage. Everyone from Swift to West was jamming along to him as his performance was definitely one of the highlights of the broadcast, portraying a monstrous and dark side of love and the world.

The first day of game week is under way for USC football, and head coach Steve Sarkisian has released both his depth chart and his play-calling responsibilities.
Sarkisian handed off the reins of the offense to offensive coordinator Clay Helton.
“I can still be involved with the play calling,” Sarkisian said in his weekly USC Athletics video.  “Clay Helton has got such a good hold of our offense right now, that I’m confident he can do that.”
Sarkisian also expressed that not being in charge of play-calling will free his time to work on other things with the team.
“It frees me up to be with the defense more, work with special teams,” Sarkisian said.  “And to be, in my opinion, more of a complete head coach.”
Sarkisian surprised no one by naming Cody Kessler the starting quarterback and was full of only the highest praise for the redshirt senior.
“One thing I appreciate about Cody is that he’s a gym rat, he’s a blue-collar guy,” Sarkisian said of the USC standout quarterback.  “He’s never satisfied with where he is at.”
Unlike many previous USC quarterbacks, Kessler was not a highly ranked recruit. Sarkisian attributes his work ethic and dedication as the factors that led him to where he is now.
Behind Kessler at the helm of the offense is redshirt sophomore Max Browne.  Freshman Sam Darnold is the third-string quarterback.
Sophomore standout Adoree’ Jackson is the listed starter in three positions as well as being slotted second as a wide receiver.  Jackson is the starting corner back, punt returner and kickoff returner.
“The hard part with Adoree’ is you want to give him a lot, but you don’t want to give him too much,” Sarkisian said.  “You’re maybe going to even see him in the backfield some.”
“The reason we’re able to do all this with him is he’s got an extremely high football IQ and his work ethic is amazing,” Sarkisian said.
The other wide receivers who will be working alongside Jackson are junior Darreus Rogers, redshirt sophomore Steven Mitchell Jr. and sophomore JuJu Smith-Schuster.
Smith-Schuster will work with Jackson as a kickoff return man.
Also on the offensive side of the ball is a very deep line that will start with senior Max Tuerk.  Around him will be redshirt junior Zach Banner at right tackle and Toa Lobendahn or sophomore Viane Talamaivao at right guard.  On the left side of the line, either redshirt junior Chad Wheeler or Lobendahn will start at left tackle.  Sophomore Damien Mama will fill the left tackle position.
The only freshmen slotted to be potential starters for the offense this season are tailbacks Dominic Davis and Ronald Jones II.  They are listed in addition to redshirt senior Tre Madden.  Junior Justin Davis is questionable due to injury.
Stepping into the big shoes at defensive end that Leonard Williams left will be redshirt senior Greg Townsend Jr.  Freshmen Rasheem Green and Christian Rector will also likely see playing time.
Junior captain Su’a Cravens is listed as the starting outside linebacker. Fellow senior captain Antwaun Woods has been listed as the starting nose tackle.

Since February, Trojan fans and the media alike have praised USC and Sarkisian for a top-notch recruiting class. Full of four-star and five-star recruits, the class of 2018 has brought a lot excitement to Troy about the upcoming season. In addition to the new recruits, the Trojans will start a pair of walk-ons in 2015.
Redshirt sophomore tight end Connor Spears and junior kicker Alex Wood have both been named starters in their respective positions after joining the team as walk-ons.
Spears was forced to sit out last season per NCAA rules after transferring from Columbia. He played in five games as a freshman at Columbia and caught three passes for 32 yards.
Spears was originally set to be used as a reserve tight end in 2015 until Bryce Dixon was removed from the team after a violation of student conduct. Dixon’s absence created an opportunity for Spears, who impressed coaches in spring practice and fall camp.
Wood’s opportunity comes after the departure of last year’s starting kicker Andre Heidari. Wood started out as a reserve walk-on placekicker in 2012 and appeared in two games while Heidari was coming back from an injury. He hit all eight attempted extra points against Syracuse and Stanford.
Wood did not see any action as the backup in 2013, but appeared in eight games in 2014. Wood handled kickoffs in USC’s last eight games in 2014 and even served as placekicker against Arizona and Colorado while Heidari was again rehabbing an injury. He hit all 12 of his attempted points after touchdowns.
Though USC is renowned for its football prowess and legacy of college football and NFL greats, it is nice to see that walk-ons are still given a shot. Maybe I’m just a sucker for a Cinderella story, but it would make the season that much sweeter if it were aided by the success of walk-ons.
Though he wasn’t a walk-on, USC great Matt Cassel served as a backup to Matt Leinart and was always considered a reserve quarterback. Nowadays, Cassel is a quarterback for the Buffalo Bills. Leinart, on the other hand, was never able to forge a successful NFL career despite being drafted in the first round of the 2006 NFL Draft.
Though his reputation is surely in question right now, Tom Brady is another example of a great NFL quarterback who wasn’t intended as a starter. When he first enrolled at Michigan, Brady was listed as the No. 7 quarterback on the depth chart. Meanwhile, future NFL quarterback Brian Griese led the Wolverines to a Rose Bowl and a national championship. Brady eventually won the starting job in his last two seasons and went on to be drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.
Though Wood and Spears have a long way to go before they can be compared to the likes of Cassel and Brady, the 2015 season could be the beginning of two storied careers.

As USC fans, we’ve been lucky enough to watch a Su’a Cravens-type player before. Fifteen years ago, Troy Polamalu did it all for the Trojans, commanding the defense with his uncanny ability of getting into opposing backfields while also being able to drop back into coverage. Amazingly, Su’a Cravens’s monster 2014 season already has many comparing him to the two-time Super Bowl champion and USC legend.
While the pairing of quarterback specialist Steve Sarkisian and Heisman candidate Cody Kessler is sure to excite Coliseum crowds this season, the union of Cravens and defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox will be equally vital in keeping the Trojans’ playoff dreams alive.
“Love having Su’a on the team. He’s a very talented guy, he’s a big body, he’s a strong kid, he’s a good tackler and he’s still getting better,” Wilcox said. “He’s a very bright guy.”
With Cravens’s play at an all-time high in his new position, a combination of outside linebacker, box safety and nickel cornerback described as a “space-backer,” and Wilcox continually looking for more ways to utilize his talents, there’s no limit to what Cravens can achieve in his upcoming junior season.
“I can make plays wherever he puts me,” Cravens said at this year’s Pac-12 media day. “Coach Wilcox does a great job of just seeing offensive game plans, and then scheming around that and getting me in a position where I have the opportunity to make a play no matter where I’m at on the field.”
Cravens, a 2014 All-Pac-12 first-teamer who is a candidate for the Bednarik, Butkus, Lombardi, Lott, Nagurski and Walter Camp awards, is the heart and soul of a defense that lost defensive end Leonard Williams and linebacker Hayes Pullard to the NFL. Coach Sarkisian hopes that Cravens’s intensity and playmaking ability can anchor an immensely talented, but young group that will be joined by rising-star cornerback, Iman Marshall.
“If Su’a Cravens isn’t a First Team All-American and Pac-12 Player of the Year on defense, I’d be shocked,” Sarkisian said after a practice last summer.
Though worlds away from the player he envisioned himself being at USC, Cravens’s game has developed into a remarkably scary weapon for Wilcox’s staff. With his great speed, he is able to cover as well as come downhill and take on running backs.
“I came here to play safety, but I’m a linebacker now so it’s LBU, and we got to hold down the defense because if they get past that first level we’re the run stop,” Cravens said.
At 6-foot-1, with long limbs, a tapered frame and impressive fluidity, Cravens looked the part of a traditional strong NFL safety coming as a five-star recruit from Vista Murrieta High. Because of his soft hands and athleticism, Cravens played offense, defense and special teams in high school. His exposure to different positions gave Cravens a unique level of adaptability and understanding of the game.
“He’s just one of those guys that knows football,” said quarterback Cody Kessler. “He always ends up at the right spot.”
Like Polamalu, Cravens possesses that rare combination of athleticism, football IQ and an immense passion for the game. It is their dedication to the nuances, techniques and schemes that put them in the position to do what they do best — make big plays.
“Even when I’m not playing football, I’m still playing football in my head,” Cravens said in an interview with the Orange County Register. “When I’m in class, I’ll daydream about plays that I made and plays that I missed. I still think about the interception I dropped against Stanford.”
Perhaps the “big plays” that Cravens is seemingly always involved in — the timely interceptions, crushing sacks and electrifying highlights — are what have Trojan fans reminiscing about Polamalu most. Cravens can be a one-man wrecking crew at times, stopping offensive plays before they start.
“Su’a is a guy who can create turnovers, he can make tackles in the backfield, he can blitz off the edge, he can cover well. I think he’s at his best when he’s around the ball,” Sarkisian said.
In his freshman year as a safety at USC, Cravens recorded 53 tackles, four interceptions, two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery. But the similarities between Cravens and the         hard-hitting Polumalu became more apparent in his second season when coach Sarkisian and Wilcox moved Cravens to the             “space-backer” position. While Wilcox hoped that the hybrid position could utilize his speed to try and take away the underneath throws that are such a staple of modern offenses, Cravens’s aggressive ability at box safety and nickel cornerback opened up opportunities for blitzes off the edge. Cravens thrived in his new role, accumulating five sacks, 68 tackles and three interceptions.
“He was ridiculously productive,” coach Steve Sarkisian said. “We made the move, and his numbers just started shooting through the roof.”
Cravens’s statistics improved dramatically in every major category besides interceptions. He made the 2014 AP All-American third team, along with the 2014 All-Pac-12 first team. He also won USC’s Defensive Perimeter Player of the Year Award.
“Being closer to the ball helps to make plays,” Cravens said in an interview with Fox Sports. “It reminds me of when I was at Vista. I got moved from safety at Vista to linebacker and ended up making a whole lot more plays. Just being able to be closer to the ball and diagnose plays faster just helps me [to make plays].”
Cravens’s 2014 season proved that there might not be anything he can’t do for the Trojans’ defense this year. He can cover deep. He can cover in the flats. He is a strong tackler and a great pass rusher. Cravens has a nose for the ball and is always around a play, even if he is not the one making it. His 17 tackles for losses were not only the best on the team, but they were also more than any other defensive back in the nation.
“I think Su’a Cravens is ready to explode — not a year from now and not at some point in November, but today, right now and with force,” wrote Paul Myerberg, an NFL analyst, in an article for USA Today Sports. “Cravens … seems ready to embrace those expectations, delivering along the back end in the mold of this program’s long line of greats at the position.”
Scouts, coaches and GMs alike rave about Cravens’s remarkable versatility, comparing him to Polamalu because there aren’t any other players like them. In a year with such high expectations for the Trojans, look for even more success from the junior. He will be closer to the ball and always in striking distance to make the next big play. Which is great for USC fans, because it might be more than 15 years until we see another player like Su’a Cravens.

After upsetting top-ranked North Carolina and Brigham Young this past weekend, USC’s star women’s volleyball player Samantha Bricio was named the Pac-12’s Offensive Player of the Week on Monday for her performance in the 2015 Women of Troy Baden Invitational.
This is Bricio’s fourth time winning the award in her storied four-year tenure at USC, which has included AVCA All-America Second Team in 2013 and 2014; Pac-12 All-Conference in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and Volleyball Magazine’s All-America First Team in 2013.
Along with fellow Women of Troy sophomore Brittany Abercrombie and senior Alicia Ogoms, Bricio was named to the Baden Invitational’s  All-Tournament Team. She was also named the team’s Most Valuable Player. Bricio has been awarded pre-conference tournament MVP six times and pre-conference all-tournament team honors 11 times during her career.
The Guadalajara, Mexico, native helped then-No. 22 USC to seal the tournament title with 58 tournament kills, 67 points and 32 digs in wins against No. 7 North Carolina (3-1), unranked Chicago State (0-3) and No. 11 BYU (3-0).
Not only did Bricio win USC’s 60th all-time Player of the Week Award — not including freshman awards — she also etched her name into the Women of Troy’s record books with her 1,485th career kill, passing former USC alums Keao Burdine (2001-04) and Megan McAllister (1987-90) for ninth place overall.
This weekend also saw Bricio come within two digs of a 1,000-digs mark for her career, a true volleyball feat.
Thanks to the captain’s 25 kills, 11 digs, .400 hitting percentage and three blocks against the BYU Cougars in the tournament’s final match, the Women of Troy are now ranked No. 8 in the nation.
Bricio could earn  back-to-back Player of the Week honors as the Women of Troy will travel to Cedar Falls, Iowa, to play in this weekend’s 2015  Northern Iowa Tournament which features a game against Creighton (1-2) on Friday,       Sept. 4, and games playing No. 10 Kentucky (3-0) and tournament host UNI (1-2) on Saturday,   Sept. 5.

Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul, Clayton Kershaw and Cody Kessler are major stars in the Los Angeles sports market; however, while Bryant, Paul and Kershaw are compensated handsomely for leading their respective teams as the face of the franchise, Kessler receives nothing for similar work.
For Kessler and the 460,000 student-athletes in the country who struggle with juggling athletics with academics and collegiate life, it is unfair for the National Collegiate Athletic Association to treat them like employees without any compensation for what is essentially a full-time job while limiting their time to devote to education.
Schools profit much more from an athlete such as Kessler than the quarterback gains from his scholarship. His picture is plastered on posters hyping the upcoming football season. His jersey number is the featured selection on USC’s online store. His name alone draws attention that provides immense profit for the school.
Yet, for being the key player — and a potential Heisman trophy winner — for one of the top programs in the country, Kessler is compensated less than the employees who sell his jersey at the student bookstore.
This is because college athletes — sorry, “student-athletes” — are not employees, a bylaw that withstood legal scrutiny earlier this month when an effort by football players at Northwestern University to unionize was denied by the National Labor Relations Board, which cited that the competitive balance between public and private universities would be disturbed if athletes at private universities such as Northwestern were allowed to unionize.
But the right to unionize, and therefore collectively bargain for salaries as employees, should not be the issue at hand here. What’s absurd is how the NCAA has allowed the situation to get this far, forcing its athletes to take action.
The NCAA is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization that just happens to be a billion-dollar industry, raking in $740 million per year from broadcasting rights for March Madness alone. According to U.S. News, the NCAA generates $11 billion in revenue annually, with 50 colleges exceeding $50 million in annual revenue. While many schools claim they failed to turn a profit, it is only because they spend exorbitant amounts of revenue on assets such as facilities, equipment and coaches.
Nick Saban of Alabama is the highest-paid coach in college football, making $7.2 million a year, while Jim Harbaugh jumped ship from the NFL to Michigan for a cool $7 million a year.  And yet NCAA president Mark Emmert still has the nerve to say that sports are “anything but a money-making proposition for universities and colleges.”
If that is the case, then it is peculiar why, as of 2014, college coaches are the highest-paid public employees in 40 states. Emmert claims that only 14 out of 1,100 schools in 2010 profited from athletics. But if true profits are the only benefit universities receive, then schools should just eliminate all athletics.
It would be naïve to believe a word Emmert says, just as it would be foolish to think that the “student” part actually comes first for “student-athletes.” Along with the NLRB’s ruling regarding Northwestern came interesting anecdotes about the life of a college football player at the university. The schedule is akin to a full-time job, with 40 to 50 hours a week devoted to football-related activities during the regular season and set itineraries for up to 16 hours a day. Road games mean spending upwards of 24 hours on football activities on Friday and Saturday alone. Coaches further the mentality that academics are not a top priority; for example, Northwestern head coach Pat Fitzgerald allows players to spend two to three hours a day studying as long as they “get their mind right to get ready to play.”
It would be unfair to generalize this situation to every other school in the country, but if Northwestern, which hasn’t finished first in the Big-10 since 2000, demands so much from its athletes, imagine what the itineraries look like at perennial powerhouses such as Ohio State or Alabama.
The NCAA claims that they are providing athletes with compensation through free education, but that is difficult for the athletes to actually take advantage of when much of their days are spent on the practice field. The University of North Carolina answered that question when its student-athletes were enrolled in so-called “paper classes” and given improper treatment by faculty just so they could stay eligible to compete.
Cody Kessler will have a fine career in the NFL and make millions of dollars in salary and endorsement deals. However, per the NCAA, he is among the 1.6 percent of college football players who go pro.
Thus, for the majority of student-athletes — the not-so-lucky ones — who struggle to balance academics with athletics and have little chance of playing the sport professionally, they must submit to a strict, exhaustive lifestyle in order to keep their scholarship — a scholarship that focuses more on being an athlete than a student.
Is this a federal/state minimum wage math problem?
They get a free education at a prestigious school. It’s not Football College they get to play college football.

This week I faced a major minor problem.
As in, I no longer have a minor. I am now only a journalism major, and for some reason I feel like that’s a huge issue.
Since stepping foot onto the  University Park Campus, I have been told about the overwhelming opportunities USC provides for anyone interested in studying whatever they want.
Majors are getting more specific, falling in line with the trend of millennials seeking fields of study that correspond directly to real world jobs, as a 2014 White House study concluded.
This translates to more fun-sounding majors like dance and interactive media and games. Want to delve into the world of people aging? Then major in lifespan health. Have a widespread interest in legal studies? Pick the new law, history and culture major.
Did Straight Outta Compton get you hyped about the music industry? Well you can major in arts, technology and the business of innovation at the [Jimmy] Iovine and [Andre “Dr. Dre”] Young Academy. Yes, that happened.
There are also academic distinctions, such as Renaissance Scholar, that can make students feel like one major just isn’t enough. The Renaissance Scholars program, according to the USC website, recognizes undergraduate students who have excelled in their studies while completing a major and a minor (or two or even three majors) in widely separate fields of study.
So the pressure was on to pick up a minor that could set me, my graduation stole and my resumé apart from everyone else at the end of college. More importantly, it would give employers another nudge to pick up my application when I started looking for full-time work.
Then a weird thing happened last week on the first week of classes. I felt like on my race to specialization I hadn’t yet fully grasped my first major, which is print and digital journalism.
Therefore, after three years of diligently working towards a minor, I dropped it like a hot potato. This freed up my schedule to take more specialized classes in my major.  I’m re-dedicating my senior year to all things journalism.
It was an extremely hard decision, but after consulting everyone from my parents to my academic advisor to Yahoo! Answers, I’m kinda, sorta sure that I’m now on the right path.
What can I say? I’m a millennial and, like all the blogs and studies have hypothesized, millennials like to switch it up on the winding road of career paths, jumping from here to there but hoping our education helps us land on our feet.
And our first test is college. We work so hard at gaining a college identity and become tied to it. Our major becomes our identifier. I would put money on “What’s your major?” being the most asked question during Welcome Week, right next to “Where are you from?” (Answer: Chicago.)
A statistic from the most recent U.S. Census showed that maybe that question doesn’t really even matter anymore. The 2010 U.S. Bureau of the Census counted only 27 percent of college graduates held a job closely related to their major. That means my journalism major might take me into the world of teaching. Or a psychology major might work as a project manager after graduation.
A mentor told me a few weeks back that she got her degree in the health sciences field. She’s now about to launch a media business — something completely unrelated to the biology and chemistry classes she took. When I asked how she made that major shift, she at first said, “Yeah, I don’t even use my undergraduate degree anymore.” But then she paused, corrected herself and said, “Actually, I guess I use it everyday because you need a bachelor’s to get yourself in the door.”
In this job economy it matters more about how you can apply the skills you acquired from the classes taken and lessons learned than just the titles on your resumé. It’s about taking that difficult class that you’re frightened of, but which could also serve as the perfect anecdote during an interview.
It’s about using college as a time of preparing yourself for the not-yet created careers or strengthening your adaptability skills for ever-changing industries. Over the past four years, and even more this past week, I’m learning that it’s not necessarily about what the diploma will say.
Still not convinced? I think Kanye West put it most eloquently on Sunday at MTV’s Video Music Awards, “I’m confident. I believe in myself. We the millennials, bro. This is a new mentality.”
Now, it’s up to us to change the approach to selecting majors and minors.

Scoreboard · Redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler carries a lot of responsibility to put points on the board for the USC offense this fall. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
With less than a week until the college football season kicks off, the Trojans named their captains for the 2015 campaign on Saturday following a mock game at the Coliseum.
Five players were picked as captains: quarterback Cody Kessler and center Max Tuerk on the offensive side, and linebackers Su’a Cravens and Anthony Sarao and defensive tackle Antwaun Woods on the defensive side.
Three defensive players were chosen because the vote was so close.
“They are great representatives for our program, not only on the field but off the field in general,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said of the five captains. “We’re excited to have those guys lead our team.”  
Kessler and Tuerk, who were also captains last season, are the 13th and 14th multiple-time captains in USC history. Cravens, Sarao and Woods will be serving their first seasons as captains.
Cravens, the lone junior to be granted captaincy, was grateful for the honor.
“It means a lot coming from the locker room with the team voting,” Cravens said. “I didn’t really expect to get it. I was surprised. As a team, we have a tight locker room, so it means a lot.”
One of the responsibilities the captains assume is taking freshmen under their wings, but this year’s incoming class makes the task a lot easier, according to Kessler.
“It’s been really cool that these guys don’t have egos,” Kessler said. “You normally get one or two guys here who think they’re better than everybody else. Every single guy I’ve worked with or talked to that’s a freshmen is so humble and so hungry. They just come out and work every day. Speaking for the captains, I have nothing to worry about with the freshmen.”
The same goes for for players coming up from junior college, who are quickly integrated into the Trojan lifestyle.
“It’s just the ’SC standard,” Sarao said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re [from junior college] or a freshman. ’SC has one standard — one way to play, one way to prepare — and that’s how we teach them.”

Miley Cyrus is my personal Jesus. There’s something magnetic about her un-manicured and DGAF attitude at a time when pop culture seems to be veering toward the polished Taylor Swift & Co. singer/models of the world. Basically, I think she’s twerktastic.
In honor of her existence and her hosting the VMAs this year, I’ve ranked her songs from “bestest” to “best” – (because even though some aren’t great, Miley is, so by transitive property they get my seal of approval).
Enjoy!
