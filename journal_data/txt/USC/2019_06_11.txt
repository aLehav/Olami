Constance Rodgers, the longest serving employee at USC, will step down from her position and retire July 31 after serving the University community for 56 years.
“My experience working with Connie has been one of just admiration,” said Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management Carol Rush. “I really admire the way she handles very complicated and difficult situations. She’s able to keep the school’s secrets safe and the dean’s work private, but [makes] everybody feel super welcome.”
Rodgers began working during a period of growth at USC, and the executive assistant to the dean at the Price School of Public Policy has seen the school transform from just a handful of buildings to the institution it is today. Price named April 29 “Connie Rodgers Day,” in celebration of Rodgers and her wish to prepare students for careers in public policy with a focus on human relationships.
“When I first started here at USC on April 15, 1963 there were very few buildings on campus,” Rodgers said. “Nothing in [McCarthy] Quad was there.” 
At a staff recognition ceremony held in April, Price School Dean Jack Knott said Rodgers has made a lasting impact at the University because she takes the time to foster relationships with students.
“Often I’ve had experiences where distinguished alumni will contact the dean’s office … I assume they’re coming to visit me, [but] they’re coming to see Connie because they remember her and she remembers them,” Knott said. 
Interim President Wanda Austin officially recognized Connie Rodgers as an honorary Price dean during the celebration. 
“She is a shining example of the very best our Trojan staff has to offer,” Austin said. 
Rodgers first worked as a receptionist and secretary for the School of Public Administration at the International Public Administration Center, which served international students. She then  became a secretary at the Von KleinSmid Center. 
“One day, the director of the School of Public Administration at the time, Kim Nelson, needed someone to work for him, and [former dean] Ross Clayton told him I was available,” Rodgers said. 
Throughout her years as the dean’s assistant, Rodgers worked to expand the School of Public Administration as it became the School of Public Policy and Development and later the Price School when the departments merged in 1999. 
Afterward, Rodgers became the gatekeeper for the dean’s office, managing the official and private schedules of the head of the Price School.
“My claim to fame was that you had to see me if you wanted to meet with the dean,” Rodgers said.
Rodgers was “inherited” by seven deans because she gained a positive reputation at the Price School.
Knott said Rodgers has a knack for organization, managing to maintain her relationships with USC community members and address their concerns while keeping up with her hectic schedule. 
“She’s a very important liaison between the dean and the rest of the school and the dean and the rest of the University because she’s somebody who helps build those relationships,” Knott said. “I think she’s been successful for many of those reasons.”
As she steps away from her daily routine at Price, Rodgers said she wants to continue nurturing the friendships she has made at USC. 
Price professor David Sloane said Rodgers makes everyone — administrators, staff and students — feel at home at USC through her kindness and generosity. 
“She just knows everybody who does anything,” Sloane said. “She knows all the people that clean the building, she knows all the people that do the parking, she knows all the people who teach, she knows all the deans.”
During her retirement, Rodgers hopes to travel to Paris with her granddaughter, which Price helped her fund. At Rodgers’ recognition ceremony in April, Price representatives also gave her guidebooks, French language books and a “Parisian hat.” In the future, Rodgers plans to volunteer at an infant care facility and become more involved with her church.
“My most meaningful part of this experience at USC has been the relationships that I was able to garner,” Rodgers said. “I try to be nice to everyone. It’s nice to be important, but it’s nice to be nice.

The Dworak-Peck School of Social Work may be forced to lay off nearly half its staff and most of its part-time employees amid a financial crisis caused by a new online degree programs launched in 2010, according to the Los Angeles Times. The programs, designed to boost tuition revenue, instead caused the school to drop in U.S. News and World Report rankings and lose money.
“We continue to believe that online master’s and professional doctoral programs serve an important role in higher education,” Provost Michael Quick said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
According to the Times, the online master’s degree programs nearly quadrupled the size of the student body from 900 in 2010 to 3,500 in 2016. However, increased enrollment led to greater expenses, such as paying faculty and supplementing tutoring services. The digital learning platform which the University uses for the program, 2U, also significantly cut into the school’s revenue — raking in 60% of the  money made from the online programs. 
Cheaper competitors cut into the school’s applicant pool and, as a result, the school began admitting less qualified students. Once among the top ten social work schools, according to the U.S. News & World Report ranking, the school now occupies the 25th spot. 
The school’s requisite 3.0 grade-point average was not upheld, as the school became financially dependent on admitting students in order to fill classes and generate revenue. According to the Times, 40% of entering students were conditional admits, failing to meet GPA standards and other requirements. 
“Changes in graduate enrollment patterns are inevitable,” said Quick, who will leave the University June 30. “All schools are required to submit balanced budgets each year and those budgets can fluctuate based on enrollments. We are proud of our social work school. These adjustments will ensure the school is on solid footing as it seeks its next dean.”  
A University committee recommended laying off 45% of non-teaching staff, cutting study abroad and international programs and eliminating adjunct professor and mid-level dean positions in response to the school’s budget deficit over two years, the Times reported. Already implemented plans include requiring full-time faculty to teach heavier course loads at the same salary. 
Although the University has not made the fiscal details of the crisis public, accountants hired to assess the school’s financial state predicted the budget deficit would reach $40 million by 2020 if budget cuts were not implemented, the Times reported. However, a University spokesperson told the Times the deficit was closer to $10 million.
The school is currently leading efforts in an attempt to fix the school’s admission standards and reputation.

The savory aroma of cooked meat is not what you might expect to find while walking down Vermont Avenue. But on most late weeknights, that’s exactly what you’ll get if you pass by the AutoZone and Vermont Outlet True Value parking lot near campus. The smell comes from Tacos Listo, a taco stand that caters to students late at night.
Los Angeles has an historic love affair with taco trucks and stands, and USC is no exception. Known to students as Taco Zone (due to its proximity to the AutoZone) Tacos Listo has become a popular option for both students and locals craving delicious late night Mexican fare.
“We start at 11 a.m., and we cook the rice and prepare all the other ingredients for the tacos, and by 4, we have everything set up, and we only take two hours to rest, as a break,” said Benito Rios, who runs the stand with his family and friends.
By the time they’re ready, their folding table features three different salsas, cucumbers, pickled onions with habanero pepper, cilantro, chopped onions and limes. Rios and his team function like a professional crew at a NASCAR race, each with a prescribed role in preparing a customer’s meal.
Rios said he has worked at taco stands from a young age, and in the food industry for over 14 years. Four years ago, he decided to open an independent stand of his own.
Tacos Listo initially struggled, as few students would come to the somewhat hidden operation. However, word of mouth quickly spread, and students grew obsessed with the stand. A student-led Instagram account, @istacozoneopen is solely dedicated to telling students when the stand is open. It has amassed over 900 followers since it was created in April 2018. 
When it comes to the food, Rios said students typically prefer to eat quesadillas and quesa-burritos, which feature cheese fried on top of a plancha and put into a burrito. The quesa-burrito costs $7, making it more affordable than some of the foods offered on campus and at USC Village.
Tacos Listo offers a variety of meat choices, from carne asada and al pastor — pork typically marinated with pineapple, orange and multiple types of red peppers — to cabeza (cow head), lengua (cow tongue), buche (pork stomach), pollo and chorizo.
Tacos Listo also offers mulitas, essentially smaller quesadillas made with thicker tortillas. Rios said he would like to expand the stand’s menu by making tortas and asada fries to further appeal to students, who he said are Tacos Listo’s primary customer base.
It’s not uncommon to see families with young children rubbing shoulders with frat boys grabbing a bite to eat. The stand often becomes a melting pot of the local South L.A. community and young college students. 
“What I like about taco stands and [this one in particular] is that they’re such a good mix of local residents and students,” Grace Corsi, a recent USC graduate, said. “It makes for interesting conversation, especially if you speak Spanish. It’s nice to not be in an insular college bubble that I think a lot of people don’t really step out of.”
Rios said he enjoys working at the stand and wants to see it grow to other locations. 
“I’m just very happy to do what I’m doing and … I’m having a lot of success. I’m very proud of it,” Rios said. “One of my favorite things is to make the client feel as if they had the best meal they’ve had in a long time.”

When a male student walks into a restroom, he has access to everything he needs — a toilet, toilet paper, soap, paper towels. But when a female student (along with many trans and nonbinary folk) uses a restroom at USC, there’s something big missing: If they are on their period, they have no access to resources to take care of themselves. To fix this, USC should offer free menstrual products in on-campus restrooms and rectify this inherent inequality. 
If a menstruating student does not have a tampon or pad with them, they are left to sit in their blood in classes. Without adequate products, poor vaginal hygiene can lead to infection or other illnesses. 
Or, they’re forced to miss class to go elsewhere to buy hygiene products, impeding their ability to succeed in classes. By offering menstrual products, USC can eliminate both those issues and prove that it cares about its students’ well-being.
Periods have long been used to perpetuate female inferiority. The fact that women could not control their own bleeding was historically seen as mysterious and debilitating, and those attitudes carried over into shaming women over menstruation — these attitudes still exist, and by ignoring the existence of menstruation in USC restrooms, USC confirms such feelings.
By charging for menstruation products, living as a menstruating individual is more expensive simply because they experience an innate biological process — women, trans and non-binary students shouldn’t be forced to pay so much simply for having the bodies they do. 
To put the cost into perspective, a basic box of 20 tampons from CVS Pharmacy costs $5.68. At such a price, menstruating people may spend at least $150 annually just to take care of their bodies. 
This financial burden is one that USC should take on to take care of its students. 
According to Aunt Flow, an enterprise dedicated to providing menstruating individuals easy access to tampons and pads, it would cost about $5-$7 per menstruating person annually to supply a school. The products can be stocked as easily as toilet paper. 
Similar amenities, such as condoms, hand sanitizer and even sunscreen are made readily available for students in USC Housing free of charge — there is no good reason menstrual hygiene products shouldn’t get the same treatment. 
Plenty of universities such as Harvard and Brown University offer students access to menstrual products. 
USC should follow their lead, and take this significant step in showing that it cares about its female, trans and non-binary students. 
In January 2018, the Undergraduate Student Government Senate voted unanimously to provide free menstrual products in USC’s gender-neutral and women’s restrooms. 
While USG acknowledged the issue in menstrual product accessibility, it does not have the power to institute the change the greater University can.
Being able to take care of oneself is not optional — it’s a basic human right. 
If USC can’t even address that, it becomes clear that the University does not support the basic rights of its female, trans and non-binary students.

“All the world’s a screen,” and if anyone understands that best, it’s Charlie Brooker, creator and writer of the “Black Mirror” TV series. 
Last week, Netflix released the anthology series’ fifth season. Although — so far — critics have not received the latest set of three episodes as positively as those of previous seasons, “Black Mirror” has not stopped its cultural critique of technology’s dangerous ability to mess with the natural order. 
“Smithereens,” the second story in the fifth season, does this best for one main reason: It makes sure viewers know that the story is taking place right now. But before I get into the plot, a word of warning: Spoilers ahead!
One of the first things we see is a year — 2018 — an oddity in “Black Mirror,” which does not typically acknowledge exact temporal settings of its stories.  “Smithereens” is purposefully set in 2018. 
Soon after, we are introduced to the main character of the hour-long episode: Chris Gillhaney (Andrew Scott), a rideshare driver based in London. 
Something’s off about this guy: He’s constantly meditating, calming himself down, and he always sets up his taxi in front of an office building for Smithereens, a fictional Facebook-Twitter-hybrid social media conglomerate. He is waiting for someone, someone who works at Smithereens to hop in his car. 
Finally, a lowly Smithereens intern, Jaden Tommins (Damson Idris), steps into the car. Chris kidnaps him and holds him at gunpoint, demanding Jayden get Smithereens founder Billy Bauer (Topher Grace) on the phone to talk. Tensions rise as Chris, the cops and the media are caught in a stalemate: Unless Billy speaks to the angry, unpredictable Chris, Jaden will continue to be held hostage.
Another uncommon occurrence in a “Black Mirror” episode, the social indictment doesn’t come until later, it comes in the final twenty minutes of the episode.
Billy gets on the line with Chris, who tells the story of a car accident that killed his girlfriend and the other driver, who happened to be drunk. The blame was pinned on the drunk driver, but Chris knew the truth: He was checking a Smithereens notification while he was on the road. The guilt had eaten him up until he decided the only way to expiate the incident was to confess his sin to Bauer himself. 
In other words, “Smithereens” is a really long “don’t text and drive” ad. But, it’s also much more — it’s a whole indictment on the “trending” culture we’ve built on Twitter, Facebook and every other platform. 
Throughout the standoff, we see that everyone is talking about it on Smithereens; Chris and Jayden are trending worldwide. 
The tension finally explodes when a sniper is authorized to shoot Chris. The first misses completely, but the second … well, the episode cuts to the credits before we can see the outcome. Before it completely cuts to black, however, we are shown quick snippets of people checking their phone after a notification comes in and then quickly moving on to their next task. 
These snippets are eerie reflections of how our current culture treats tragedies and major events. If it’s done trending, we’re done caring.
We see the entire world through screens now. That’s good when we can have live updates on everything from a family members’ health to a major government election. Yet, as our consumerism worsens, the Internet — and all the entertainment within — becomes a space dedicated solely to attracting and holding its users’ attentions. 
“Smithereens” is not about Chris’ tragedy so much as it is about the tragedy of how we would react to something like that really happening. The episode — written by Brooker himself — doesn’t even let us get away with pinning such attitudes on a fictional future population; this story is meant to take place in 2018 because it’s a reflection of what is happening now. 
There’s a void left in not knowing how the sniper’s shot turned out, but that’s the point: All those people getting a notification in the end are aware of what happened, they got the news, but they don’t even take a second to let it sink in. They move right on with their lives as if nothing had happened. 
When an event stops trending, when it loses the fight for our attention, it’s like nothing had ever happened. “Black Mirror’s” “Smithereens” wants us to feel that void and makes us consider if it’s really worth it to make all our world a screen.

The Frank Sinatra Hall was packed with an excited crowd Thursday to welcome USC alumnus Chad Stahelski, director of “John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum.” 
Hosted by the School of Cinematic Arts, the film was screened for the audience, followed by a panel discussion with Stahelski, editor Evan Schiff and supervising sound editor Mark Stoeckinger. All three are SCA alumni.
The star-studded cast of “John Wick 3” includes Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Anjelica Huston, Halle Berry, Lance Reddick and Ian McShane. The latest installment of the action franchise was released May 17 and has so far brought in over $150 million worldwide.
The film follows Wick running to save his life, as he is now being deemed excommunicado from the assassin world. With a $14 million bounty on his head, all assassins have been disbarred from helping him, as they too will be punished for any assistance they provide. Throughout the film, Wick is saved multiple times by people who owe him favors.
“Keanu and I had worked together to figure out how intense to make the scenes,” Stahelski said. “We didn’t want any limits. But it is not an easy sell for the studios. We have, however, been fortunate that the ‘John Wick’ films were everything we dreamed about for the last 30 years.”
Stahelski spoke about creating a particularly challenging scene where Reeves, Berry and two dogs fight a team of assassins.
“There were a lot of challenges, such as the geography of the space, the dogs and knowing where everything was placed,” Stahelski said. “This particular scene took two months to plan. This included training the dogs to fight and having one of the dogs bite the assassin’s genitals. But that is why it was such an exciting scene! It was hard to convince the studio to spend a million dollars on training dogs to bite a man’s genitals, but we were able to make it happen.”
As the session came to a close, Stahelski also gave filmmaking advice to the SCA audience. 
“You have to speak the other person’s language in order to get what you want,” Stahleski said. 
He mentioned that in his career, he had to learn to do many jobs in various filmmaking departments to make his movie exactly how he wanted. 
He said that  to “speak the language” of different production departments allowed him to have more creative freedom, something usually hard to come by with a big-budget action film. 
“I literally watched this movie more than 100 times for press junkets,” Stahelski said. “I take full responsibility for 100 percent of the edits, scenes, etc. I was fortunate to have 100 percent of the creative decisions, so I take pride in what we have done.”

The Chinese Ministry of Education issued its first “study abroad alert” of the year last week, warning students that they may be subject to increasing U.S. visa restrictions should they choose to study in America. 
The federal government’s increased suspicion toward Chinese researchers is the latest development in a vicious trade war between Beijing and Washington. 
Fueled by concerns about China’s emergence as a technology powerhouse, the Trump administration seeks to extend “America First” to education — at the expense of Chinese international students.
Visa restrictions are bound to ripple through to USC, where almost a quarter of the student body consists of international students, and nearly half of them are Chinese. 
While a key component of USC’s ethos is its facilitation of international dialogue, government policy renders this mission difficult by alienating talented and deserving scholars. International students only bolster the exchange of ideas essential to college campuses, and new restrictions on visas will hurt the University’s commitment to a diversity of culture and thought. 
FBI Director Christopher Wray claimed that China is exploiting academia’s open research and development environment, comprising a “whole-of-society threat.” In addition, he said that Chinese students systematically act as access agents to America’s technology base, with former CIA officer Joe Augustyn alleging that Chinese graduate students “are briefed when they go and briefed when they come back.” According to them, ignoring academic espionage not only allows China to grow rich off American innovation but also succeed America as the world’s technology leader. 
While the national security threat posed by intellectual property theft is real, the extensive student spy network that the U.S. government fears is far less so. 
A 2018 National Science Foundation study found that nearly 9 out of 10 Chinese PhD students intended to remain in the United States after college. The sheer majority of Chinese students seek job opportunities, not trade secrets, and have little incentive to jeopardize their career growth through illicit activity.
Such sentiments toward Chinese students are loaded with borderline racist undertones, restricting their access simply because of their ethnicity rather than because of any reasonably suspected threat. 
Federal visa policy therefore, effectively serves to single out the Chinese community for special scrutiny.
When the U.S. government describes such students as a “whole-of-society threat,” it is far more acceptable for the campus community to do the same, causing alienation and isolation among Chinese students. They would have to live with uncertainty about their very presence in the United States, serving as a detriment to their mental health and often, their ability to succeed in classes.
Chinese students also significantly contribute to USC’s coffers, and more broadly, the U.S. economy. In all, Chinese students in the U.S. generate $12 billion dollars for the United States — visa restrictions will understandably cause many students who may have wanted to study in America to turn to other countries where they can be more certain about their ability to graduate and work in that country. 
Not only would this result in fewer dollars for both USC and the U.S., it would mean that the University would lose talented prospects who could contribute to valuable research at the school. 
Visa restrictions against Chinese students are ultimately thinly veiled racist policies, and have no positive ramifications for the United States. In fact, such restrictions pose significant harm to colleges and the U.S. economy — especially schools with high international populations like USC.

After a disappointing football season in which USC missed a bowl game, contemplated firing head coach Clay Helton, and retained new offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury for all of a month, Trojan football finally appears to be getting back on track. 
Multiple sources are confirming that USC will welcome former 5-star recruit wide receiver Bru McCoy and 4-star cornerback Chris Steele this coming fall. The team hopes to right the ship for a Trojan recruiting class that finished outside the top ten for only the fourth time in 20 years. 
News of McCoy’s decision to transfer arrived in late May. A product of Mater Dei High School, McCoy first committed to the Trojans in January but left to play for the Texas Longhorns after short-lived USC offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury was hired by the Arizona Cardinals. 
After standing out in Longhorns’ spring camp, McCoy returned home for his high school graduation and tweeted about his intention to leave Texas.
“After a lot of thinking and talking with my family, I’ve decided to leave UT and return home,” McCoy wrote on May 31. 
Days later, a source close to McCoy’s family told the Los Angeles Times that McCoy intended to transfer back to USC because of a case of homesickness during his spring semester at Texas. 
On June 5, McCoy retweeted an image posted by incoming freshman wide receiver Kyle Ford of the two wearing USC football uniforms, further proving his recruitment to the Trojan roster.
On the heels of McCoy’s announcement, the Los Angeles Times reported that Chris Steele intended to back out of his commitment to the Oregon Ducks and that Steele’s father had indicated that his son would be enrolling at USC.
“It’s looking like that’s going to happen,” Norman Steele told the Times last week. “I don’t see anything else happening.”
This announcement comes after a long recruiting saga for Steele, who first committed to the Trojans in July 2018. He backed out months later and then signed a letter of intent with the Florida Gators. 
Steele participated in spring practice and took classes in Gainesville before announcing that he would enter the NCAA transfer portal on May 9. Days later, he signed with the  Oregon Ducks. 
Steele’s father has indicated that Steele’s commitment to Oregon was largely due to USC’s lack of scholarship spots at the time. Now that space has become available, it appears Steele, who attended high school only 30 minutes away from USC, will be returning home to wear cardinal and gold.
The likely additions of both McCoy and Steele represent major boosts for the Trojans heading into summer camp. McCoy is viewed by many as a generational talent. He was the No. 1 athlete and No. 9 overall prospect, per 247Sports’ 2019 composite rankings. The pass-catcher boasts an imposing 6-foot-2-inch, 205-pound frame and wowed during practices in Austin with his speed and physicality.  
On the other side of the ball, Steele could reinforce a defensive backfield in need of depth following the departure of three defensive backs to the NFL. 
Steele’s combination of ball skills and speed could provide the Trojans with welcomed support and fill some of the void left by the departure of former USC starting cornerbacks Iman Marshall and Isaiah Langley. 
Although McCoy and Steele’s decisions have garnered the most attention, redshirt junior wide receiver Velus Jones Jr.’s decision not to leave the program may prove to be the most impactful for the Trojans heading into the upcoming season. 
Jones entered his name into the NCAA transfer portal in March and reportedly considered following former USC offensive coordinator Tee Martin to Tennessee. On June 3, however, Jones announced his intention to remain a Trojan.
The NCAA requires transfers to sit for a year before they can become eligible. Though both McCoy and Steele have appealed this, their eligibility in 2019 remains up in the air. 
Jones, however, is a sure bet to contribute to the Trojans’ 2019 campaign. He saw significant time as both a receiver and a kick returner in 2018 and appeared in all 12 games. Over the season, Jones had 24 receptions for 266 yards and one touchdown over 21 kickoff returns.
USC already appears to be set at the wide receiver position with returning starters Michael Pittman Jr., Tyler Vaughns and Amon-Ra St. Brown. Last season the trio racked up 159 receptions for 2,182 yards and 15 touchdowns. Jones can be utilized in the slot, given what appears to be an embarrassment of riches at the receiver position for USC.
As the Trojans transition to new offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s “air raid” offense, Jones’ return coupled with McCoy’s arrival may underpin what may be one of college football’s deepest position groups heading into the 2019 season.

USC and United Airlines have agreed to a new naming rights deal for the Coliseum, after facing some backlash regarding the original name change.
The two parties came to a 10-year deal that will result in a new name for just the field, instead of the entire stadium. The field will now be called the United Airlines Field at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum starting August.
USC and United had initially struck an agreement in May 2017 to rename the stadium United Airlines Memorial Coliseum. The 16-year deal provided USC over $69 million to use toward the Coliseum’s renovation, part of a $315 million undertaking. 
Shortly after the original naming rights deal was agreed upon, veterans groups protested that changing the name of the stadium would dilute its identity as a memorial to World War I veterans.
“I think there are certain things that we shouldn’t sell,” said Janice Hahn, president of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, who sided with the veterans back in March. “The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was built in an effort to honor those men who were from Los Angeles that marched off in World War I and never came back.”
Hahn also pointed out the numerous historical events that the Coliseum has hosted — including the 1932 and 1984 summer Olympics and a visit from Nelson Mandela — to emphasize the idea that the Coliseum serves just as much as a war memorial as it does a sports stadium.
Neither USC nor United have released the financial details of the new agreement, which was shortened to 10 years instead of the original 16. Under the revised deal, USC and United said they will support the stadium’s commitment to honor local veterans by supporting veterans who attend USC and erecting a new memorial at the Coliseum to honor veterans.
“I am pleased that USC and United have come together in a way that will honor the memories of veterans who served in World War I and our broader community of veterans,” Hahn said in a statement. “This agreement ensures that United Airlines remains an important corporate sponsor of the Coliseum renovation project and that the legacy of the Coliseum remains. I am proud that we are moving forward with a shared commitment to veterans.”
Interim president Wanda M. Austin agreed with Hahn’s perspective that the benefits of the deal extend far beyond the Coliseum’s renovation.
“USC is honored to be the caretaker of this Los Angeles treasure and, together with United, we are ensuring the Coliseum’s future as a world-class venue,” Austin said in a statement. “The naming of the field is a significant step in USC’s efforts to usher in a modern era for this historic landmark and preserve its legacy.” 
Although United officials initially said that the company would be willing to step away from the agreement if USC did not agree to the original name change, the company said it has much to gain from taking on such a prominent role in the Los Angeles community.
“With so many employees, many of whom are proud veterans themselves, and customers that travel to or call [Los Angeles] home, this sponsorship is a meaningful way to underscore our commitment to California,” said Janet Lamkin, president of California for United Airlines, in a statement. “We always want to do what is best for the communities in which we operate — and in this case, reaching an agreement which upholds the name of such a respected venue while modernizing it for the benefit of future generations was the right thing to do.”
The introduction of the field’s new name will coincide with USC’s first football game on Aug. 31 against Fresno State at the Coliseum.

Seven USC baseball players were selected in the 2019 MLB Draft last week. The Trojans were selected on the second and third days of the event, adding to a record total of 340 selections — more than any other NCAA school.
Junior pitcher Chris Clarke was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the fourth round. Clarke, the highest drafted baseball player from USC since 2014, was the first Trojan selected in the draft. The Westlake Village native had an exceptional 1.03 ERA in 52.1 innings as a reliever this season. Clarke began his career at USC as a starter, but he rose as a dominant force out of the bullpen in his last season.
Junior outfielder Blake Sabol was selected in the seventh round by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Sabol led the team this season with 13 stolen bases, 3 home runs and 22 RBIs. He was a consistent presence in the Trojans’ lineup, starting in every game for USC the past two seasons.
“So thankful for the [Pittsburgh Pirates] organization for giving me the opportunity to play the game that I love for a living,” Sabol wrote in an Instagram post following his selection. “Today is just a new beginning and one step closer to reaching the dream I’ve been pursuing since I was a little boy.”
Redshirt junior catcher CJ Stubbs finished off the Trojans’ day two selections after getting drafted by the Houston Astros in the 10th round. Stubbs finished this season with 6 home runs and an .844 OPS. Stubbs was mainly a pitcher for the Trojans in his first two seasons, but he had to sit out his third year due to his Tommy John surgery. After recovering, Stubbs returned as the Trojans’ primary backstop for 2019.
Stubbs’ brother Garrett recently made his Major League debut on May 28 — catching for the same Astros organization that took the younger Stubbs in the 10th round.
Junior pitcher Connor Lunn was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 11th round. Lunn was initially the Trojans’ closer, but he emerged as the Trojans’ best starting pitcher as the year progressed. He won seven games while striking out 79 batters in 83 innings, comprising a 3.69 ERA on the season.
The San Diego Padres selected junior outfielder Matthew Acosta in the 12th round. Acosta was USC’s most consistent offensive performer, leading the team with a .319 average, 7 home runs and 40 RBIs. 
Two Trojan pitchers were selected by the Kansas City Royals. Junior pitcher Austin Manning was taken in the 19th round after striking out 25 batters through 21 innings in relief for the Trojans. Manning was joined on the Kansas City draft board by sophomore Augie Sylk, the final Trojan to be selected. Sylk spent the majority of the season recovering from an injury and only appeared in one game for USC. His name was called in the 38th round. 
This draft included the most Trojans since the program record of twelve picks in 2016. All seven will have until July 12 to decide if they will return to USC for another season or forgo the remainder of their college eligibility to begin their journey to the big leagues with new clubs.

The Marshall School of Business has a new leader.
The University announced Tuesday that Geoffrey Garrett, dean of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, will become Marshall’s next dean. Garrett replaces Jim Ellis, whose termination was protested by multiple Marshall donors. A petition against Ellis’ removal garnered over 4,100 signatures.
Following the deanship announcement, Garrett spoke to reporters about his plans to emphasize experiential and lifelong learning during his time at USC. Garrett will begin his term in July 2020.
“The centrality of both business schools to the broader universities is something I really cherish,” Garrett said, describing the similarities between Wharton and Marshall. “While all institutions are unique, and I want to spend a lot of time listening to people at Marshall and learning from them, I think I have — at least at a structural level — a pretty good understanding of where a school like Marshall fits because that’s where Wharton is in the educational landscape.”
Garrett is returning to USC after spending seven years at the helm of Wharton, the top-ranked business school in the country. He previously worked as a USC professor from 2001 to 2005 and served as dean at two business schools in Australia, where he was born, before heading to UPenn.
Though Wharton is ranked No. 1 and Marshall comes in at No. 17 in business school standings, according to U.S. News and World Report, rankings are not a part of Garrett’s concerns.
“If you do a good job, if the school is doing a good job, then the rankings will take care of themselves,” he said. “I don’t have an enormous focus on rankings.”
The new dean announcement comes on the heels of a slew of changes in USC’s administration. Provost Michael Quick, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and Rossier School of Education Dean Karen Gallagher have all announced their departures from the University. Garrett is the first dean to be hired as President-elect Carol Folt transitions into her new role and Interim President Wanda Austin transitions out of it.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Folt said she was highly involved in the hiring of the new dean, and she appreciates his approach to leadership, considering the changes at the University.
“He’s going to talk to people,” she said. “He wants to know how the community feels. We have to reestablish trust. We have to build back to a point where people are all feeling that they’re part of the decisions being made. I think that’s something he’s very mindful of, and it’s what I have to do, coming in as a president at this time.”
Transparency and “plain-speaking” communication are both key aspects to his leadership style, Garrett said. He explained that he sees deans as leaders of teams where everyone is involved in decision-making.
“If you involve more people in decisions and if they feel very free to speak their minds, to share their best ideas, I think that increases collective intelligence and improves the quality of decision-making,” he told reporters. “So, on the input side, I think you make better decisions if you involve more people, and I certainly want to practice that … The more [that] people feel like they were involved in decisions, the more likely they are to roll up their sleeves with you and [help with] implementation.”
Folt commended his forward-thinking approach regarding business education.
“There’s a lot of changes happening just in business education, and we’re in a moment when we get to look at the next phase,” she said. “What do we want to be in the next ten years? How do we see ourselves doing that?”
Garrett’s appointment comes after a four-month search, following Ellis’ announced ousting in December 2018. His term was cut short due to his alleged inadequate responses to sexual harassment and discrimination claims. However, his removal was met with much criticism from the Marshall community. 
Lloyd Greif, the benefactor of the USC Marshall Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, spoke out against the administration’s decision back in December and continues to oppose the administration’s decision to remove Ellis.
“I think that the end doesn’t justify the means,” Greif said, following the announcement of Garrett’s appointment. “Regardless of whether Garrett is the best man for the job or not, Ellis should still be there for the next three years … The fact that they’re now replacing him in twelve months, and he’s leaving in two weeks, is a disconnect.”
Greif explained that Garrett and the new USC administration will have to rebuild much of the trust that was lost after Ellis’ termination.
“Emotions are running pretty high here at the Marshall School,” he said. “There’s going to be some serious fence-mending that needs to be done to repair the damage done by Wanda Austin and Michael Quick. That’s not going to happen overnight, and that’s not going to be easy.”
Folt explained that at this point, she is just looking ahead.
“I think what we need to do is recognize the strengths of the people who got us here, and Dean Ellis certainly played a big role,” she said. “We look at where we are, we look at the strengths we have, and we build going forward. That’s what a new president can do. That’s what the new dean can do.”
As Marshall enters its centennial year, Gareth James will temporarily take the reins of the school as interim dean. James is currently a professor at the school and directs the Institute for Outlier Research in Business. He has worked at the University for 20 years, including four years when he served as vice dean for faculty and academic affairs at Marshall.
“I think the raw material and the momentum at Marshall and USC are just fantastic,” Garrett said. “I look forward to being a part of that.”
