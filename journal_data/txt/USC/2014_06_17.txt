After years of frustrating false starts (Superman Returns, Green Lantern) and a disheartening number of unrealized or abandoned projects (Joss Whedon’s Wonder Woman, George Miller’s computer-animated version of Justice League), the superstructure of the DC cinematic universe is finally beginning to take shape.

While Marvel Studios continues to add to its menagerie of spandex-clad do-gooders, DC has struggled to expand its stable beyond Batman and Superman, a problem emblemized by Zack Snyder’s awkwardly-titled Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which unintentionally conjures images of the two heroes locked in a Kramer vs. Kramer-style custody battle over Robin. All that changed last week, however, when notorious entertainment blogger Nikki Finke posted what she said was a leaked production schedule, one that Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment were apparently hoping to unveil at next month’s San Diego Comic-Con. The list, which has since been all but confirmed by filmmaker and Fat Man on Batman podcaster Kevin Smith, includes a total of seven movies revolving around every character from Shazam and Sandman, each one slated for release at some point during the next four years. If the schedule holds true, DC could easily find itself releasing two to three movies a year for the foreseeable future.
It’s a risky, deliberately idiosyncratic lineup, very different from the shameless duplicate of the Marvel model many fans and online commentators were expecting. Instead of slowly building up to Justice League — its 2017 release date is only halfway down the list — by giving its most prominent members a bunch of solo adventures, DC is instead planning what amounts to a meta-human mélange, starting with Batman v Superman, which promises to be less a sequel to Snyder’s own Man of Steel — that one won’t show up until 2018 at the earliest — and more a direct lead-in to Justice League.
Batman v Superman, which was delayed until 2016 due to the sheer enormity of its cast and their other professional commitments — will be responsible for introducing viewers to several future leaguers besides the Dark Knight and the Last Son of Krypton, including feminist icon Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot from Fast Five), the unfairly ridiculed Atlantian monarch Aquaman (Jason Momoa, a.k.a. Khal Drogo on Game of Thrones) and the student athlete-turned-superhero Cyborg (relative newcomer Ray Fisher), the last of whom has enjoyed a recent spike in popularity thanks to an expanded role in the comics — particularly under Geoff Johns and Jim Lee’s New 52 reboot — and Cartoon Network’s resurrection of the Teen Titans animated series.
After Batman and Superman finish their grudge match, audiences will be treated to the big-screen debut of one of the oldest superheroes in the history of the medium, even though he technically belonged to the now-defunct Fawcett Comics for the first few decades of his existence. Shazam, formerly known as Captain Marvel, has been around since 1939, but “the world’s mightiest mortal” still gets dismissed by casual fans as an underpowered Superman clone. He’s actually little Billy Batson, a kid reporter who comes across a benevolent wizard — coincidentally named Shazam himself — who deems the boy a “champion of good” and endows him with the ability to transform into a full-grown superhero anytime he shouts the word, “Shazam!” The Captain is an unabashedly goofy, optimistic, pure-hearted character, one who stands in purposeful contrast to the League’s many brooding, angst-ridden members, and any film featuring him is practically guaranteed to be a hit with younger audiences. In fact, it wouldn’t be a stretch to picture a family-friendly star like Dwayne Johnson in the title role.
2016 might also see the release of Sandman, possibly the most intriguing title on the content slate, even though it will likely have no bearing on the events of Justice League. Based on Neil Gaiman’s critically acclaimed horror fantasy comic, the story centers on the existential wanderings of the Endless, a group of all-powerful beings who double as anthropomorphic representations of the universe’s most ancient and vital aspects. The series, which has been celebrated for its epic scope, rich characterization and intricately detailed narrative, regularly finds itself on lists of the greatest graphic novels of all time, right up there with Alan Moore’s Watchmen and Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns. The film version will star Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the mercurial Lord of Dreams and is being scripted by The Dark Knight co-writer (and USC alumnus) David S. Goyer. Between this and the upcoming Constantine television series, we could be in for a rash of new goth-tinged comic adaptations. Guillermo del Toro may even be able to make his long-rumored version of Justice League Dark after all!
The list also teases a standalone Wonder Woman film in 2017, which should please any fan who’s ever wondered why it’s taken more than seven decades for the most famous female superhero in the world to finally headline her own movie. Hopefully Gadot, who’s already faced criticism for being too short and slight for the role, can summon the right combination of pluck and potency to make the Amazon princess a true force to be reckoned with, both onscreen and at the box office. The actress certainly has more combat experience than most Hollywood starlets, having trained in the Israeli army for two years during her late adolescence.
Last but not least is something we haven’t really seen before: a superhero buddy movie. That’s right, the final film on the list calls for a feature-length Flash and Green Lantern team-up. This has all the makings of a zany fun sci-fi romp, but its critical and commercial success will hinge almost entirely on the chemistry and rapid-fire rapport that must exist between its two costumed stars. If this duo is anything less than dynamic, it’s doubtful we’ll ever see a quality version of Hal Jordan on the big screen.
After years of uncertainty, it looks like DC finally has a workable game plan that doesn’t involve kidnapping Christopher Nolan and chaining him to a director’s chair. Speaking of Nolan, it’s worth noting that there are currently no plans for another solo Batman movie. Ben Affleck’s version of the Caped Crusader will doubtlessly appear in all but a few of these forthcoming movies, but it’s strange to see DC and Warner Bros. ignoring the guaranteed revenue a new Bat-film would bring in. Could it be a long-overdue sign of confidence in the rest of their heroes? Or are they just holding out for Affleck to direct the next one himself?

Father’s Day has come and gone, but that doesn’t mean we have to stop appreciating the type of cooking that’s usually considered “dad” territory. Yes, grilling season is in full swing, and Los Angeles’ unique cultural diversity affords Angelenos a variety of options that go beyond the typical hot dogs, burgers, ribs and steaks (though no one’s going to complain about those, either).
The types of meats used in different cultures are, for the most part, similar to what one would normally expect, but the difference lies in the cuts of meat, as well as the different spices and ingredients used in marinades. Here are a couple easy-to-follow recipes to insert some unique and delicious variety in your barbecue offerings this summer.
Pollo a la Brasa
This recipe for the iconic Peruvian chicken dish is easy to prepare with ingredients that are at any local grocer — or already on your pantry shelf. The marinade gets its denaturing acidity from lime juice and a healthy dose of the Japanese flavor phenomenon umami from the soy sauce. Paprika helps accentuate the smoky flavors you’ll be getting from the charcoal, and the cumin and garlic add a fragrant, savory touch.
As with any barbecue, real estate on the grill can be hard to come by. And though this dish is wonderful when cooked over coals, it also lends itself well to being cooked in the oven, freeing up room for other meats while bringing another protein-packed dish to the table.
 
Ingredients:
1 whole chicken, skin-on and cut into quarters (two leg-and-thigh pieces, two breast pieces)
1 lime, juiced.
½ cup soy sauce
1 ½ teaspoon paprika
2 ½ teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
6 or 7 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced lengthways or minced.
1 teaspoon brown sugar
2 tablespoons olive oil
 
Directions:
1. Combine every ingredient except the chicken in a blender and pulse briefly until combined.
2. Place chicken in large, sealable plastic bag(s) and pour in marinade. While being careful not to spill the marinade, press out any residual “air pockets” prior to completely sealing the bags.
3. Marinate, chilled, for at least 16-24 hours.
4. When it’s time to cook, remove the chicken from the marinade and pat the chicken dry — notably, the skin — with a paper towel. This will help you achieve a nice, crunchy crackling.
If cooking on the grill:
1. Oil the grill grate liberally and arrange coals in a centralized “heap.” This ensures that there are lower temperature areas on the grill where the chicken can cook thoroughly without fear of overcooking.
2. Lay the chicken skin-side down on the “direct” heating areas of the grill and cook for about 3 minutes to get a nice sear on the skin.
3. Immediately flip and move the seared pieces to the “indirect” part of the grill and cook for 25-30 minutes, or until cooked through and juices run clear. Note that cooking times may vary based on the heat in the grill and the size of the chicken pieces.
 
If cooking in the kitchen:
1. Preheat oven to roast setting at 400 degrees, with the roasting pan inside.
2. Take a wide saucepan and drizzle some olive oil in the pan. Lay the marinated pieces of chicken on the cold, oiled pan skin-side down.
3. Put the saucepan on medium-low to medium heat for 15 minutes and cook only with the skin side down. Check to make sure the skin is not sticking to the pan.
4. Flip the chicken over and transfer it to the roasting pan along with a cup of water, and cook in the oven for 25 more minutes, or until finished and juices run clear. Note that ovens and cooking times may vary.
Korean Galbi Marinade
Though traditionally made with a very specifically cut and prepared short rib known as wang-galbi, the flavor the Korean galbi marinade imparts to any well-marbled cut of beef (or even chicken thighs and pork belly) is the true secret behind those fantastic flavors in some of Koreatown’s finer barbecue establishments.
This recipe calls for an Asian pear, a spherical, light amber-colored pear that can be hard to find and expensive out of season. It can generally be found at the Korean grocer year round or at your local Whole Foods Market — its unique, understated sweetness is integral to the dish. A bosc pear also works, but the Asian pear is preferred. As for meat, feel free to use a pound of any tender, well-marbled cut of beef for this marinade (and adjust proportions accordingly for bigger portions) — and be sure to cook it over lump charcoal for optimal flavor.
 
Ingredients:
1 Asian pear, peeled and cored.
1 ½ tablespoon of Korean rice wine. Sake can also be used.
½ cup of soy sauce
½ cup of brown sugar
1 green onion, chopped
1 medium yellow onion, chopped.
4 cloves garlic, minced
½ teaspoon of freshly cracked black pepper
¼ cup of sesame oil
 
Instructions:
1. Wash the meat out with cold water and pat dry. This will assist the meat in taking on the flavor of the marinade.
2. Score the meat with very shallow, opposing diagonal cuts running throughout the flat surface of the meat. It should create a diamond-shaped pattern.
2. Puree the pear and the Korean rice wine or sake until it reaches a consistency resembling apple sauce. Gently massage this mixture into the meat, and let the meat pre-marinate in the refrigerator for 15-30 minutes.
3. Combine the remaining marinade ingredients and incorporate the sugar by either blending or whisking quickly.
4. Remove the meat from the refrigerator and gently massage the marinade into the meat. Do NOT steep the meat in the marinade — the steak will be ruined, parties will be canceled and there will be weeping, moaning and gnashing of teeth. Make sure all of the meat is covered in the marinade. Marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for at least six hours for traditional short ribs, and overnight to 24 hours for thicker cuts.
5. When cooking the meat, be sure to shake off excess marinade before applying the meat to the grill. Cook to desired doneness.
 
Caipirinha
Now all this meat wouldn’t be half as good without a cold beverage to wash everything down. In the spirit of this year’s World Cup in Brazil, the nation’s iconic cocktail the caipirinha has enjoyed a revival this summer. The primary ingredient for the caipirinha is cachaça, a liquor distilled from sugarcane juice. Cachaça is available at any BevMo and most supermarkets nationwide. This recipe is adapted from Fogo de Chao, a Brazilian barbecue restaurant in Beverly Hills.
 
Ingredients:
½ cup cachaça
1 lime
2 tbsp. coarsely granulated sugar
Ice
Splash of sprite
 
Directions:
1. Slice the lime into wedges and muddle them into the bottom of the glass.
2. Add ice and pour in cachaça, and add a splash of Sprite.
3. Enjoy responsibly.
Entertaining for the summer doesn’t necessarily have to mean the same things served at a barbecue over and over; a little extra effort shopping goes a long way in ensuring that the guests (and dad) leave the table full and happy.

In America, a good education is not easily brewed up. So when Starbucks announced Monday that it would pay for its employee’s college education, the company showed that it valued its employees’ educational aspirations by financially supporting them through the process of gaining their bachelor’s degrees. To make a more impactful statement about the role of education within the large corporation, however, Starbucks should give the employees who take advantage of this new policy the chance at more promotion options that allow them to integrate their degree and newfound skillset into the company.
Art by Grace Wang
As the largest coffeehouse chain in the world, Starbucks employs 151,000 full-time employees, according to 2013 statistics from Starbucks Company. Under a new deal with Arizona State University, Starbucks employees will be able to take online classes that are paid for by the company. According to The New York Times, the employee has to work at least 20 hours a week and have the grades and test scores to gain admission into the university. Once that criterion has been met and the employee has already completed two years of college, Starbucks promises to pay for full tuition for at least two years of college. If the employee is just starting his or her higher education, the company will pay part of the cost.
“In the last few years, we have seen the fracturing of the American dream,” Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said in a statement.
The push to provide its employees with a college education is not new to Starbucks. This plan replaces an existing tuition program that gave workers $1,000 a year to study at City University of Seattle, located in the same city of the company’s headquarters, or Strayer University online.
The decision to make this an online degree program is spot on. According to a 2011 study by U.S. News, online enrollment for college classes is increasing. More than 6.1 million students took at least one online class during the fall of 2010, which was an approximately 10 percent increase from the previous year. Furthermore, Arizona State University has one of the largest online degree programs in the nation with a great assortment of options for classes.
Yet with any educational aspirations there has to be a plan. At most U.S. universities and colleges there is a career center where students can access and meet with counselors to discuss how his or her major and field of study will correlate to a job at the end of the day. College is about finding a career.
Therefore, as part of this wide-net plan, Starbucks must look at the full picture. Where do they want their employees to go after completing their degrees? Surely not everyone will stay. There should be the option, however, of getting promoted or more integrated into the company if the bachelor’s degree is achieved under Starbucks’ dime.
If baristas are given no plan of what to do with their degrees then they will just be more college-educated baristas with no higher career options. That doesn’t seem like a fix to the problem.
According to the Guardian, in 2013, more than a quarter of a million college graduates were working minimum wage jobs. There is nothing wrong with minimum wage jobs, but since college degrees have traditionally led to a promise of a solid job with security. a transformational educational initiative such as Starbucks’ must try to return a college degree to the same standard it once had.
Yes, an education should take one to the next level. And yes, Starbucks is sending a clear message that they value education in their workers. But if Starbucks is doling out the cash they should plan to integrate the returns of a more educated workforce back into that company. That will surely keep the company — and its employees — moving forward in the future.

Last week, Judge Rolf M. Treu of the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled against tenure, claiming laws protecting teachers from being fired prevent students from accessing “a basically equal opportunity to achieve a quality education.” Opponents of his decision believe that without protection, good teachers will be fired and the educational system as a whole will suffer.
Though there are plenty of valid arguments for tenure — and there is certainly a lot of ground to cover before our educational achievement gap is fixed — Judge Treu’s decision is ultimately a step in the right direction, addressing systemic failures in the education system. Furthermore, it will set a precedent nationally that will give more states more leverage to implement necessary education reform.
The case, Vergara v. California, was brought about by a group of students claiming that tenure laws protecting bad teachers deprived them of the education they deserved. The students were backed by David Welch, a Silicon Valley millionaire who started the group “Students Matter” — although this case was specific to California, the group plans to file lawsuits in states throughout the country.
Educational reform in America is an incredibly complex issue, one that will not be solved just by eliminating tenure. But tenure represents a culture of refusing to hold teachers accountable for their actions, and removing it is a good way to begin changing this.
In California, a teacher can receive tenure in just two years, essentially guaranteeing a lifetime job based on a very short amount of time. This presumes that the effectiveness of teachers doesn’t change over their career, a fundamental flaw in the hiring system — over a career of potentially 30 years or more, it is entirely probable that good teachers could burn out, or bad teachers might improve. A teaching career should not be made or broken based on just two early years.
It is true that teaching is a uniquely difficult job, and teachers should not have to feel as if their career is in jeopardy — this itself would be counterproductive to effective teaching. And it is admittedly difficult to receive useful and reputable feedback from students and peers of teachers, as the concept of an “effective teacher” is very subjective. But the current tenure system is not the answer to these issues; according to the New York Times, firing a teacher can take almost a decade and cost up to $450,000.
This kind of protection is unheard of in any other profession. If a doctor behaves unprofessionally, they lose their medical license because they could potentially hurt their patients — a bad teacher’s impact on their students’ lives, however, is protected and ignored. It forces school administrators to either keep bad teachers or — in many cases — to transfer them to another school. This has a hugely negative impact especially on schools in low-income areas, where they cannot afford to transfer these ineffective teachers.
Where Judge Treu’s ruling falls short, though, is in its failure to offer alternative options and by placing too much blame on the tenure system for causing problems in education. Simply removing tenure is likely to be fought to the point where it is either appealed or has a negative impact on the pool of potential new teachers — such a drastic policy change is very likely to backfire. Instead, policymakers should be fighting for a system in which teachers are offered a certain level of stability, but are evaluated periodically over the course of their careers. This would make the change in policy easier to stomach for teachers and unions, while still addressing the problem of teachers’ effectiveness dropping over their career.
Problems with education in America aren’t going to be solved overnight, but the Vergara v. California is significant in that it is addressing one of the real causes: a lack of accountability on the part of teachers. Too often blame is placed on the students themselves, and policies are made to treat symptoms rather than the real problems, such as when test standards are lowered to create the illusion of students passing. Although policymakers should be cautious of such a dramatic change in policy,  if they remove tenure while simultaneously implementing other necessary educational reforms it will be a very positive step.
Education Secretary Arne Duncan of the Obama Administration applauded the decision, claiming it will “build a new framework for the teaching profession.” The impact of this decision will reach farther than just California — depending on how this new framework is implemented, it could signal a positive change in educational policy on a national level.

One of the points that you missed is that tenure often goes to those with conforming views, The goal of tenure was not to create a monolithic culture of education.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Thursday, June 12, and Tuesday, June 17. 
Crimes against a person
at 3:04 a.m. on June 14, it was reported that several males were involved in a physical altercation at 28th St and Figueroa St. A student and his friend told the officers they were kicked and punched by two suspects during an argument. The suspects fled once the officers arrived, and the two victims did not wish to press charges.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 4:14 p.m. on June 12, it was reported that a suspect was yelling obscenities and racial slurs to passersby at the Grace Ford Salvatori Hall. The suspect refused to leave after contacted by DPS officers, and she was arrested and transported for booking.
at 2:12 a.m. on June 15, a suspect was riding his bicycle without a light on the wrong side of the road, and was detained by DPS officers. A check of his name revealed an outstanding warrant, but upon further investigation it was revealed that the warrant was not his and he was released.
at 12:04 a.m. on June 17, DPS responded to a student who dropped a pot of boiling water on himself and burned his arm. A LAFD Unit responded and transported him for medical treatment.

Over the course of this past year, USC has seen a decrease in on-campus crime. Administrative officials are attributing this reduction to the various new security measures implemented following the Halloween night shooting on campus in 2012.
Barriers · The fencing surrounding the university’s campus was erected in January 2013, as well as restricted hours from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The Halloween incident occurred at an on-campus party, and left one victim in critical condition and three others injured. Those involved in the shooting were not affiliated with the university.
The bulk of the new security measures following the shooting were implemented in January 2013. One of the main stipulations was that students, staff and registered guests entering campus between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. are required to show campus identification at the eight entrances that remain open.
The university also added security and license plate recognition cameras, and hired additional security personnel to monitor the gates during the restricted hours. More workers were also brought on to provide 24-hour security in the on-campus residential halls where students are now required to scan their fingerprint prior to entry.
Carlisle said he attributes much of the crime reduction on campus to the restricted hours that the gates remain open.
“The bottom line is that security measures have reduced crime in the residential halls,” Carlisle said. “Also, we think [the new measures] reduced other thefts around campus because it’s harder for thieves to get in after 9 p.m.”
Security personnel are also often stationed outside USC’s 24-hour Leavey Library and patrons entering the building, as well as those already inside, are required to show a student ID after 9 p.m.
Though DPS will not yet disclose specific statistics, Carlisle said the department analyzes crime on a weekly and sometimes daily basis, and has seen a noticeable decrease in crime since the implementation of the security measures.
Official statistics from DPS will be compiled in a few months as part of the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, which requires college campuses to document three calendar years of campus crime statistics and make a report available to the public by Oct. 1 of each year.
The Los Angeles Times, in a June 14th article, reported LAPD data that indicated 49 instances of burglary or theft on campus during the overnight hours in 2012, compared to only 23 instances in 2013. According to police records gathered by the newspaper, instances of violent crime, including robberies and aggravated assaults, also fell from 11 cases in 2012 to just four in 2013.
Because, however, official DPS data has not been released, Carlisle noted that this data may not be completely accurate. Los Angeles, Carlisle said, is divided into various reporting districts, which maintain their own crime statistics. USC is its own reporting district and the aforementioned statistics reflect LAPD reports in the area, rather than DPS’s own recordings. Carlisle said DPS and LAPD will discuss and reconcile statistics prior to the release of the Clery report.
“[The LAPD] numbers to me look exaggerated because there are some in there that wouldn’t necessarily be in our Clery numbers,” Carlisle said. “Although, they should be if we are both following the same guidelines.”

Students in the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism can look forward to a number of changes beginning in the fall 2014.
In addition to the completion of the new Wallis Annenberg Hall, all students will be required to have laptop computers in the classroom. The policy is referred to as BYOD, or bring your own device.
Gordon Stables, assistant dean for Student Affairs, and James Vasquez, associate dean of information technology and facilities operations at Annenberg announced the new policy requiring all Annenberg students to have a PC or Apple laptop in a memo to students on June 13.
“As part of our school-wide 21st Century Literacies Initiative, we believe these developments will provide a breadth of opportunities that will be unique to you as a USC Annenberg student,” they said in the memo.
The announcement on the Annenberg website said that the policy would allow the school to “focus resources on a mobile-rich and technology-intensive environment.”
In addition, the memo said the school will phase out all class-specific fees and implement a school-wide Annenberg Access (Technology) fee giving students access to both new and existing technology services, software access and free printing.
According to the memo, a 2014 Annenberg student survey found that 99 percent of students currently own a laptop, but to assist students in purchasing new devices, the school has partnered with KST Data and HP to provide four HP EliteBook 840 packages that meet the minimum system requirements.
The packages range in price from $1,047 to $1,657. They also stipulated that current students with a new laptop do not need to purchase a new device.
Minimum technical specifications for Apple or PC laptops is available online at vc.uscannenberg.org.

The university is gearing up for freshman orientations this summer, with the first session coming up on June 19-20.
In total, there are seven freshman, non-international sessions over the course of the summer, with the last falling on July 29-30. Lisa Starr, director of orientation programs, describes the orientation experience as an opportunity for students to begin navigating their new lives at the university.
“Orientation is your road map — to help the anxiety of the registration process be out of the way by the time you come to Welcome Week,” Starr said.
The two-day period allows incoming freshman to get properly acquainted with the university and, as Starr mentioned, register for their classes in the fall. The orientation office plans for the sessions up to a year in advance, and is currently transitioning from operating under Student Affairs to the admissions office.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs Gene Bickers oversaw the transition. “The switch makes sense in a lot of ways,” Bickers said, “because all the admission officers visit high schools and also meet with students on campus, and so it sort of makes sense that orientation would be handled by the same part of the university.”
In addition to the change in structure, a few small-scale adjustments were made to this summer’s series of orientations to improve the individual experience for each student attending.
For example, this year’s attendees will have individual or small group sessions with advisors to coach them through the registration process. New USC parents will also have the opportunity for a question-and-answer session with current USC parents, Bickers said.
Starr stressed that, more than anything, the most important goal of orientation is to make sure students don’t feel lost in the process of adjusting to college life.
“We’re a large university, but we want to have a small college experience, and I think that’s what our orientations through the summer enable us to do,” she said.
Each orientation session holds roughly 300 incoming freshman, and from there, the students are divided into groups of 15-20.
“You’re going to relate to 15 or 20 students more than you are 300,” Starr said.
Starr has something in common with the incoming freshman. Joining the orientation team as director in January, this is also going to be her first summer orientation series. She stated she’s not apprehensive, but just eager to witness how it turns out.
“I’m just excited. I want to see it all come together,” she said.

USC is a destination of higher learning for talented individuals the world over, but it’s also home to a highly skilled football team. Incoming students this fall will be joined by a group of skilled football recruits. Fall 2014 Daily Trojan editor-in-chief Euno Lee and sports editors Will Hanley and Aubrey Kragen discuss the potential impact of the incoming freshman class.
 
1. Which freshman recruit do you think has the best shot to make a big impact in his true freshman season?
WH: Tight end Bryce Dixon has a real chance to make a statement as a freshman this season. Dixon is a highly coveted four-star recruit out of St. Bonaventure-Ventura, where he caught passes from future USC quarterback Ricky Town. Though high school statistics are hit-or-miss, Dixon’s are impressive: He picked up 740 yards on 63 catches from the tight end position as a senior. With Xavier Grimble’s departure and senior Randall Telfer’s nagging knee injury, the Trojans were left with junior Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick at the position this spring.
Cope-Fitzpatrick has only caught three passes over the past two seasons, and most of his playing time has come on special teams. Dixon’s size (6-foot-4, 230 lbs.) is already comparable to Cope-Fitzpatrick’s (6-foot-4, 255 lbs.), and the freshman will put on weight rapidly with a college weight program. Though Dixon will be behind when he enrolls in the fall and Steve Sarkisian’s new offense will likely cut out the two-tight end sets often seen under Lane Kiffin, I predict that Dixon is too much of a weapon not to be used immediately. And it must be mentioned that the last tight end coached by Sarkisian, Washington’s Austin Seferian-Jenkins, was the second player at his position selected in the 2014 NFL Draft.
 
2. Which 2014 recruit is the most exciting for USC fans?
AK: Defensive back Jonathan Lockett might provide a spark to the Trojan secondary just like safety Su’a Cravens did as a true freshman last year. Lockett, who was a four-star recruit out of Southern California powerhouse Mater Dei, did it all in high school, spending time at cornerback, wide receiver and returner. Though he might not see much playing time as a freshman, the 2013 Prep Star All-American will learn from senior defensive back Josh Shaw and junior corner Kevon Seymour and has the goods to bolster the long tradition of Trojan stars out to come out of Mater Dei.
WH: This answer seems obvious -— and it is. Adoree’ Jackson is a once-in-a-generation athlete who will immediately contribute in multiple ways. Jackson, who hails from Marqise Lee’s Serra High School in Gardena, California, is a consensus five-star recruit and ranked by many as the best defensive back in his class.
Jackson’s freakish athleticism and versatility draw favorable comparisons to former LSU corner Tyrann Mathieu, while his pure speed is reminiscent of former USC safety Taylor Mays. Jackson, who is an Olympic hopeful in the long jump, will certainly be a kick-returning weapon for Steve Sarkisian at some point. If there is a hole in Jackson’s game it would be his height, which at 5-foot-10 might prevent him from covering some of the Pac-12’s bigger pass-catchers. Jackson could make up for this with pure physicality; he is a hard-hitter who will be deployed as a surprise edge rusher at times. Either way, expect some exciting moments from Adoree’ on multiple sides of the ball in the years to come.
 
3. Which 2014 recruit has the most to prove coming into USC?
AK: Quarterback Jalen Greene has the most to prove as a freshman, if he ever gets the chance. The three-star recruit out of Serra-Gardena took third-team reps as an early enrollee and looked more mobile than his competitors in redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler and redshirt freshman Max Browne, but much less accurate. Though he might not see time on the field this season, Greene must show up in practice to prove himself worthy of eventually succeeding or surpassing Browne, lest he suffer the same fate as former Trojan quarterback Max Wittek.
WH: John “JuJu” Smith will have to fight to make a name for himself in what is becoming a crowded secondary. Smith played safety at Long Beach Poly, and has the size (6-foot-1, 206 lbs.) and pedigree to immediately start at nearly every school in the country. But Smith will have to usurp either redshirt senior Gerald Bowman or sophomore Leon McQuay III, both of whom saw playing time in 2013, for a starting role at safety. It will not be any easier for Smith at cornerback, where Jackson, junior Kevon Seymour and senior Josh Shaw will all see playing time. Aside from Jackson, Smith is the Trojans’ only five-star recruit, and he will certainly make a large impact down the line. Still, it will take an impressive effort from the Long Beach native in fall camp to earn a starting role.
EL: Athlete Adoree’ Jackson. The hype surrounding Jackson’s decision was one of the major storylines during the recruiting season, but the 5-foot-10 defensive back will have to establish his physicality at the collegiate level to add to his fantastic hip flexor control and five-star speed to be an impact player.
 
4. What do you anticipate will be USC’s biggest personnel needs in the coming season?
WH: USC football was lucky not to be stuck with any gaping personnel holes after the 2013 season. With the departures of center Marcus Martin and guard John Martinez, however, the team did need to add depth on the interior offensive line — which it was luckily able to do.
Junior Max Tuerk will likely slide from guard to center, opening up both starting guard positions. Early-enrollee Toa Lobendahn, a four-star freshman from La Habra, California, claimed one of the spots in the spring. Opposite Lobendahn during the spring was redshirt freshman Khaliel Rodgers, but both will face heat when highly touted freshman Damien Mama (St. John Bosco, Bellflower, California) arrives in the fall. With that fierce competition, along with three returners in senior Aundrey Walker and redshirt sophomores Zach Banner and Chad Wheeler at tackle, the Trojans’ offensive line should be strong in 2014.
AK: To follow up last year’s breakout campaign, redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen and the Trojan rushing corps will need to deliver for USC. Redshirt junior Tre Madden and sophomore Justin Davis are both coming back from season-ending injuries and will need to stay healthy in order to provide a balanced offensive attack for the Trojans. With the departure of sophomore Ty Isaac, USC would have done well to recruit a running back to increase the depth of the position this year and for years to come.
EL: At a school where wide receivers were perennially the strongest in the Pac-12, as well as the nation, it’s a bit startling to see Nelson Agholor as the Trojans’ only proven deep threat. The Trojans are becoming very thin at wide receiver and the corps of sophomore Darreus Rodgers and redshirt juniors George Farmer and Victor Blackwell will have to establish themselves as legitimate threats through the Trojans’ aerial attack. The Trojans are sure to do more damage through the passing attack this season with the improvement of quarterback Cody Kessler’s throwing mechanics and another offseason building a rapport with his receivers. USC head coach Steve Sarkisian might not be as pass-happy as earlier Trojan offenses under former head coach Lane Kiffin and quarterback Matt Barkley, but the Trojans need to firmly establish the air attack to space out opposing defenses and keep them honest.
