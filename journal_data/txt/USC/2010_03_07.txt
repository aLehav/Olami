Though experts say an earthquake of level 7.8 or greater is almost guaranteed to strike the USC area in coming years, many agree the recent seismic activity in Haiti and Chile is not indicative of an increased likelihood of an earthquake in Los Angeles.
Many people are speculating that the sudden surge in seismic activity elsewhere in the world is a sign that “the big one” will soon hit Los Angeles. Experts, however, say the fault lines responsible for the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile are too distant to have any effect as far north as California.
“The fact that there were earthquakes [in Haiti and Chile] doesn’t affect our chances of having one here,” said Thomas H. Jordan, a professor of earth sciences and the director of the Southern California Earthquake Center.
Still, a number of experts say that California is due for a large earthquake — likely a quake that would emanate from the San Andreas fault line, which runs under California north of Los Angeles. During such an earthquake, waves would become trapped in the sediment underneath Los Angeles, causing 7.8-level tremors that could shake the area for up to two minutes.
The seismic waves are unpredictable, so logistics of exactly where this earthquake will hit cannot be specified. The Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, however, believes Los Angeles does face a 67 percent chance of a 6.7-magnitude earthquake or greater sometime in the next 30 years. The chance of a similar quake striking anywhere in California in the same time frame is 99.7 percent.
Jordan noted that California is not bracing itself for a specific earthquake, but that there are many possible “big ones.” Though the San Andreas fault is the most likely source of “the big one,” Jordan said there are other faults that could spark dramatic seismic activity in the region.
Jordan stressed that those living in Los Angeles should not dismiss the severity of an upcoming quake because of vague details about when and where.
“Just because it may not hit soon doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be concerned,” Jordan said. “We should be very concerned. A large quake is inevitable; it’s going to happen, and when it does it’s going to cause problems.”
Though the recent earthquakes are unrelated, the devastation that has followed the quakes in Haiti and Chile is a harsh reminder of Southern California’s own anticipated earthquake and the potential for damage.
USC, however, has taken extensive measures to ensure that, when a large scale earthquake does strike, the school will be prepared.
The USC Office of Fire Safety and Emergency Planning has incorporated a portable water filtration system that, should students and staff be trapped in an area without drinking water, can make potable water from fountains, pipes and pools. Emergency food and medical supplies have been placed in strategic locations throughout campus, as have satellite phones. Some form of an emergency kit exists within every USC-owned facility, even those on Catalina Island.
In addition, USC is committed to educating both students and staff about how to react immediately after an earthquake hits. The Community Emergency Response Teams consists of staff, faculty and students trained in fire suppression, search and rescue, and first aid. All buildings have a Building Emergency Response Team trained to evacuate students as quickly as possible.
USC also began its earthquake awareness program, the Great California ShakeOut, in 2008. A response to the earthquake threat from the San Andreas fault line, ShakeOut educates students about proper measures to take before, during and after an earthquake.
The ShakeOut itself is a simulated earthquake response drill acted out at a predetermined day and time throughout California each year. Several weeks before the ShakeOut occurs, officials work to garner publicity and to train emergency responders in basic earthquake safety. Most importantly, the program teaches the practice of “Drop, Cover, Hold,” in which people in the area affected by the tremors get under a desk or table and protect their heads and necks.
According to Steve Goldfarb, the university’s Fire Safety and Emergency Planning specialist, one of the most important steps in preparing for a quake is to secure all loose objects and furnishings.
“Earthquakes themselves don’t kill people; everything falling does. It’s critical during a quake to take cover and then stay still until the tremors have stopped,” Goldfarb said.
Even with the annual ShakeOut drill, a recent survey by USC’s Norman Lear Center found that only 12 percent of participants in the event found themselves “very well prepared” for a large earthquake.
Still, students in general seem to be well aware of the basic duck-and-cover strategy and the efforts of ShakeOut.
“My understanding is that we’re supposed to drop, cover and hold on until we’re cleared,” said Shevora Ebron, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “I think most other students know that too.”
Goldfarb will hold a seminar on earthquake preparedness in the Cardinal Room of the Lyon Center on Thursday, March 11, between noon and 1 p.m.
I live in Concepción, Chile, and I went to graduate school at SC in the nineties, during the years of the riots (1992) and the earthquake (1994).  I got a taste of both again, this time with the addition of a tsunami. I would encourage everybody to have a contingency plan because when a big one hits. You wish you have at hand simple things such as a flashlight, a radio, water, and food to get through the first days after the quake.
Going through another extension of “Fight On”
And now Turkey had a quake.  We will get one by end of March.  I am typing this from under my desk.
Yup, doomsday here we come. The “duck and cover” strategy is futile. “Ducking and covering” underneath those foldable, discrete student tables when the those immense concrete walls and roof of Hoffman Hall are buckling isn’t going to protect ya. You’ll be crushed akin to when a bug is stepped on. You’re either a survivor or victim. 
Good Luck, I hope you got a will made out in advance.
Run for the hills!!!

USC boasts the largest international student population of any university in the country and is located in one of the nation’s most diverse cities  — on Friday, those two worlds came together.
Students from a wide array of countries, including Thailand, China, Australia, Taiwan, Denmark, India, Columbia, Iran and Papua New Guinea, visited Vermont Avenue Elementary School as part of the school’s Literacy Day. Now in its third year, Literacy Day is a chance for elementary school students to interact with people from different countries and cultures, and a chance for USC students to tell children the importance of reading and going to college.
Book it · A member of USC’s International Student Assembly reads aloud to children at Vermont Avenue Elementary School on Friday as part of the third annual Literacy Day. - Hide Kurokawa | Daily Trojan 
Topics ranging from after school activities to what species of animals live in each country filled each classroom Friday morning as USC students detailed their experiences growing up in other countries.
Leidy Lim, a graduate student studying teaching English to speakers of other languages, said it was fun to watch the children’s reactions as the USC students talked about their cultures.
“They ask so many questions,” Lim said. “The kids are so curious about how life in their country differs from mine. I told them Papua New Guinea doesn’t have theaters, and they were in absolute shock.”
To the kids, the experience is a fun way to learn about a lifestyle outside the United States. But many of the USC student volunteers said they might have learned just as much as the children did.
“It’s a great opportunity not for just the kids, but for us as well to give back to the society,” said Warren Chan, a senior majoring in business administration. “It’s mutually beneficial, and I find it very uplifting.”
Prior to this year, Literacy Day had previously been held at Loren Miller Elementary School. But Brenda Cortez, who is now the principal at Vermont Avenue, heard about USC’s Office of International Students and the International Students’ Assembly and worked with the groups to bring the event to Vermont Avenue.
Though this is the only outreach program specifically involving international students, OIS and ISA are looking to have a few more days like this at the elementary school. A culture day might be in the works for the future, with students from ISA spending a whole day focusing on teaching kids about traditional food, clothing and societal customs.
Many of USC’s international students, including Xiaoran Wang, a graduate student studying electrical engineering, said they hope the program will be expanded.
“The children just get so excited to see us, and it really makes me happy and makes me think to myself how I could get more involved,” Wang said.
Becky Peterson, international student adviser at OIS, said she sees a great desire among international students to participate in these outreach programs, and she hopes more events of this type will develop.
“The international kids have such huge hearts. To do something like this really showcases how much they really enjoy giving back,” Peterson said.

Groups on opposite sides of the issue are working to raise awareness of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with events held this week and last aimed at promoting understanding and, ultimately, peace.
The Israeli-Palestinian dispute has been one of the most enduring and far-reaching of all world conflicts. While many proposals of two-state plans have been suggested over the years, the core issues of recognition, borders, security and control of Jerusalem have yet to be resolved.
The issue has been as divisive around campus as it has throughout the world, and last week ’SC Students for Israel held its first Israel Peace Week at USC. Meanwhile, Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) held a two-week event called Palestine Awareness Week. Though both events approach the issue from very different sides, both groups said their main goal is peace.
Israel Peace Week featured events attempting to highlight Israel’s various achievements in hopes of working against anti-Israel sentiment on campus and promoting an optimistic outlook for the future of Middle Eastern relations. Leaders of ’SC Students for Israel said they hoped to offset prejudice toward Israel and create a more positive sentiment.
“We hope to use this event to bring out peace and coexistence for everyone by identifying actual obstacles to that peace,” said Shanel Melamed, president of ’SC Students for Israel. “We need to get together as brothers, not as enemies, in order to fight for the rights of all Middle Easterners, including Palestinians.”
The week’s events began last Monday with a workshop on Krav Maga, an Israeli form of martial arts. ’SC Students for Israel also sponsored other educational programming and will conclude Israel Peace Week with a final event to be held sometime this week. Called “Flags of Humanities,” the event will feature posters and information on Israel’s various attempts to reach out in times of need.
At the same time ’SC Students for Israel held Israel Peace Week, SJP hosted Palestine Awareness Week, aimed at promoting peace in the context of the Palestinian rights movement. The two-week event is part of the nationwide Israel Apartheid Week, a movement to educate people about “the nature of Israel as an apartheid system.”
Last week, SJP screened a film about the conflict and hosted a speaker who discussed the U.S. war in Afghanistan. They will host more events this week, touching on topics including war crimes in Gaza and the boycott of Israeli goods.
SJP leaders said they hope to educate students about the Palestinian side of the conflict.
“We hope to raise awareness about what’s happening in Palestine, voice general perspectives and show how Israeli aggression is contributing to violence in the area. Overall, our main goal is peace,” said Alex Shams, SJP president and a Daily Trojan staff member.
Melamed said ’SC Students for Israel decided to hold Israel Peace Week last week as a response to Israel Apartheid Week.
Many students said they are glad work is being done to raise awareness on both sides of the issue.
“Already at my time at USC, I’ve witnessed anti-Israel activities on campus and encountered ignorant comments from students and administration regarding Middle Eastern politics, so it’s reassuring to see efforts being made to counteract these beliefs and support true peace and cooperation,” said Daniella Fischel, a freshman majoring in business administration and cinema-television.
Mariel Levine, a freshman majoring in communication, said she hopes the two groups’ events will help in the quest for peace.
“I hope this week helps USC students come together despite their different backgrounds, religions and belief systems in order to rally for a common cause of coexistence and harmony in the Middle East,” Levine said.
Shams noted, however, that the goal of peace and common ground might be better achieved if Palestine Awareness Week and Israel Peace Week were not held at the same time.
“We should plan in ways that allow both of us to come to events,” he said.
Still, leaders of both groups said they want to work toward a peaceful resolution.
“We want to encourage a positive response to the conflict going on and look towards a brighter future instead of blaming others or pointing fingers,” Melamed said.
LOL.. yeah Israel needs to definitely go on a PR campaign (which is what it’s trying to do) after killing 1300 people.
Before you boycott Israel
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saeky9I5T9c
We at Texans for Israel would like to help interested students boycott Israel properly.
First, you need to get rid of your laptop. The Intel chip that allows it to run was developed in Israel. If you are really bent on taking down the awful war machine that happens to have the most museums per capita in the world, you must power down immediately. If you happen to have a PC, make sure it does not run a Windows operating system, because the three most recent were developed by Microsoft Israel.
If you are forced to use your computer, make sure you do not use AOL Instant Messenger, Gmail chat or any other instant-messaging system. The patents for these systems were developed in Israel, and we wouldn’t want to support that under any circumstances.
Next to go should be your cell phone. The first cell phones were developed in Israel, and it would be a tragedy if we made this a boycott of convenience. If we are really committed to bringing down the nation that produces more scientific papers per capita than any other country, we can’t be brought down by our imperialistic cell phones.
If you are concerned about the environment, boycotting Israel could be difficult. Many solar power plants use technology that was invented by Israelis, and many of them were even installed by these terrible people. On the upside, the increased fossil fuels you will use will support freedom fighters such as Hamas and al-Qaida who are dedicated to bringing down the evil country that has the most Ph.D.s per capita.
If you are a farmer, particularly in dry areas of Texas, do not use drip irrigation on your fields. This method of irrigation that saves thousands of gallons of water per year was developed in Israel.
If you go to a hospital, you are going to have to take many special precautions to ensure that you are not aiding Israel. If you have a gastrointestinal disease, make sure that the doctors do not use a “pill cam” to diagnose you, as these were developed in Israel. If you are going to be screened for breast cancer, make sure you request a method that uses plenty of radiation. The radiation-free scanning method was developed in Israel, and exposure to radiation is a small price to pay to take down the Jewish state.
If you are involved in any human rights issues on campus, boycotting Israel will be very difficult. Israel has the best women’s rights record in the Middle East and is the only country in the region in which gay marriages are recognized. Also, Israel is the only country in the region that offers asylum to Darfur refugees.
So there you have it. You are now armed with all the necessary information to destroy the country that has given us Bar Refaeli, Natalie Portman and voicemail. Good luck!
Joe– you are so totally right.  Anyone who thinks SJP is promoting peace is completely wrong and mistaken.  I went to one of their meetings once, and they are just a bunch of anti-semites who want to bring down Israel.  Im glad the Israeli group is finally standing up and telling the truth about the middle east to the world.  The Arabs, including the palestinians only want peace if ti means all the jews are dead.
wtf? you’re so fill of it. i go to every meeting and know every single person who has attended. 
a blatant liar, just like israel. what a surprise.
“Groups on opposite sides of the issue are working … with events held this week and last aimed at promoting understanding and, ultimately, peace.”
No, my poor misinformed friend, the “Palestinian” students association is working to promote anti-semitism as a legitimate, mainstream attitude. The only kind of “peace” they want is the “peace” they think will ensue when the last Israeli Jew is dead. Now, I wouldn’t go so far as to think that the idiot college kids who follow their liberal professors to this kind of rally actually BELIEVE themselves to be working for genocide (everyone but sociopaths thinks they’re on the side of good) but the reality is that they ARE working to promote anti-semitism and undermine Israel’s right to exist.

After an exciting week of competition, the No. 14 USC men’s swimming and diving team finished the Pac-10 conference meet in fourth place with 521 points, behind NCAA giants Stanford (897), California (829.5) and Arizona (654.5).
Leader · Senior co-captain James Martin swam in the 800-yard relay. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
The competition took place at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach, Calif., from Wednesday to Saturday, showcasing some of the fastest athletes in the world.
Prior to the meet, USC assistant coach Jeremy Kipp said they expected the men to “swim out of their suits.” And that’s exactly what they did.
The men started off the meet with a bang Wednesday night by winning the 800-yard freestyle relay in a time of 6:19.17. The team consisted of co-captains senior James Martin and sophomore Pat White, and freshman Clement Lefert and senior Zoltan Povazsay.
“Me, Clement, Pat and Zoltan accomplished our season goal of winning the 800-yard free relay, our first relay title since 2002,” Martin said.
It was anybody’s race at the final touch, where Povazsay managed to stretch his fingers and get to the wall .35 seconds before Stanford (6:19.52) and .62 seconds before California (6:19.79). Lefert led the relay with a 1:33.67 breaking an 11-year record which had belonged to Bela Szabados.
Coming off an already outstanding season, White and Lefert stepped it up in their individual events and stood on the podium together several times during the conference meet.
“Our top guys closed the gap significantly with the top three teams,” Martin said.
Lefert won his first Pac-10 title in the 200-yard freestyle (1:33.75), becoming the first Trojan since Keller in 2002 to win the event at Pac-10s. White battled Lefert for gold but was out-touched by his teammate and took second with a personal best time of 1:34.52.
The 500-yard freestyle also saw these two Trojans make it to the podium, with Lefert (4:16.70) and White (4:18.63) finishing second and third, respectively, behind Stanford’s David Mosko (4:14.53). Lefert was tied with Mosko with 100 yards to go before the Cardinal swimmer pulled away.
White finished off his stellar week by placing seventh in the 100-yard freestyle (43.91), followed closely by teammates sophomore Jeff Daniels (43.91) and junior Emmett Walling (44.06) who took 10th and 11th, respectively.
“Pat White began to emerge as one of the truly elite swimmers in the NCAA,” Martin said.
Lefert also took fourth in the 200-yard butterfly in 1:43.94, only slightly slower than his preliminary time of 1:43.72, which was a season best, an improvement on his NCAA consideration time and on his own school record.
Martin stepped it up in the prelims of the 400-yard individual medley and qualified first for the finals in a personal best time of 3:45.96 but was only able to muster a sixth place finish in the final, swimming a 3:48.32.
Junior Dillon Connolly took third in the 100-yard breaststroke in 52.73 and eighth in the 200-yard breaststroke, 1:57.09. His prelim time in the 200-yard (1:55.96) was a season best.

The No. 12 USC women’s tennis team served up a smooth 7-0 win over host Oregon on Friday afternoon, getting back in winning mode after two tight losses last week.
The Women of Troy started off by nabbing the doubles point to take an early lead before pounding out a string of six singles wins.
USC improved to 8-5 overall and takes a 1-0 start to conference play with the win.
Doubles play began with some new pairings for USC. Teamed up for the first time this season was the No. 40 nationally ranked duo, freshman Valeria Pulido and junior Maria Sanchez, who grabbed an 8-1 win at the top court.
With USC freshman Danielle Lao sidelined with a cold, another new doubles pair was formed at the second slot. Senior Sarah Fansler and sophomore Alison Ramos teamed up for the first time since November and posted an 8-3 win to clinch the doubles point for USC. At No. 3, juniors Jennifer Goldman and Lyndsay Kinstler had their match suspended at 5-5, when the doubles point was already decided in USC’s favor.
Entering singles play ahead 1-0, USC captured five consecutive straight-set victories before USC’s junior Cristala Andrews completed a comeback win 1-6, 6-1, 6-2 to give USC the 7-0 sweep over the Ducks. This was Andrews’ first appearance in the fourth singles position.
At the first singles slot, USC’s No. 3 Sanchez won her fourth straight match 6-1, 6-2 over Oregon’s Julia Metzger. Sanchez improved her singles record to 10-1 for the season with the victory.
On court two, No. 21 Ramos snagged a 6-0, 7-5 win, while No. 91 Pulido followed suit at the third court, posting a 6-3, 7-5 win. This was also Pulido’s fourth straight win in singles.
At the fifth slot, Fansler competed in her first dual match since being sidelined by injury and pounded away a 6-1, 6-1 victory. Soon after, in the No. 6 match, Kinstler snagged a 6-4, 6-3 win.
“It’s nice to get a win under our belt before heading into another week of more tough matches,” Sanchez said. “The team morale is really good right now.”
USC runs its all-time record against Oregon to 14-0 with the victory.

It has been a long time since the Galen Center looked like this after a USC men’s volleyball match.
Twenty minutes after sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli watched a Santa Barbara shot land out of bounds behind him, the Trojans were still on the court. Ciarelli signed a handful of autographs for children on anything they could find, from ticket stubs to sweatshirts. Just a few feet away, his dad, USC volunteer assistant coach Rocky Ciarelli, entertained a group of fans, and, just off to the side of the court, sophomore middle blocker Steve Shandrick chatted with friends and family.
Nine days after the coach Bill Ferguson said his team “embarrassed the university and the athletic department,” the former No. 1 team in the nation stepped up, and after losing the first set, took the next three to beat No. 10 UC Santa Barbara 3-1 (26-30, 35-33, 30-24, 31-29).
“I really am proud of them,” USC’s Ferguson said. “I ripped them a week and a half ago, but they absolutely responded well by practicing and playing with maturity.”
No. 7 USC (9-6, 7-5) won for just the third time in its last eight games, but, if the team continue winning, it can point to the second set as the turning point to their season.
Down 26-24 and facing the possibility of falling into a 2-0 hole, USC rallied to tie the game at 26. Yet, the Trojans nearly failed to close out the set, throwing away four set points. UCSB had a set point of its own at 33-32 after Ciarelli misplayed a serve.
But junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy came up with a kill when the Trojans needed it, and Ciarelli saved himself by finishing off the set with two aces, as USC tied the match at one set apiece.
“That was huge for us. Those were the situations where we had fought hard and fallen short before,” Ferguson said. “Tonight, they stuck with it. It wasn’t pretty out there but they stuck together, fought hard and stayed positive, and that’s what we wanted.”
USC rode that energy in the third set, as they broke open a 20-20 tie to finish on a 10-4 run. Freshman outside hitter Maddison McKibbon had a kill, and Troy got a block on a hustle point that required diving saves by McKibbon and sophomore libero Andrew Pizula to keep the ball in play.
“Not only did the score look good, but it felt good. We haven’t had a lot of feel good lately, so it was good to get that under our belts,” Ferguson said.
Another feel good story for the Trojans came via the play of Shandrick. The middle blocker made just his third start of the year, but he established himself as one of the best Trojans on the floor Friday night. He had five blocks and hit 12 kills out of 18 attempts to finish with the highest hitting percentage on the team.
“[Junior setter Riley McKibbin] and I have been connecting all week, and what we did in practice carried over to the game,” Shandrick said.
The Trojans hope to carry their momentum when they host No. 8 Hawai’i, to whom they lost earlier in the season, in back-to-back Mountain Pacific Sports Federation matches tonight and tomorrow night.
“All the hard work we’ve put into practice for the last nine days, we’ve completely turned it around,” Shandrick said. “To get that win at home is like a turning point in the season. To have that momentum from here on out, it feels like a new season.”

Officiating is one of those things nobody likes.
Seriously.
When’s the last time you came away pleased with the refereeing in a game you were watching, praising the officials for a job well done?
The officiating in Saturday’s USC-Arizona men’s game wasn’t too great, and controversy ensued.
In their last game of the season, the Trojans were up by three, 69-66, with seconds remaining in regulation. The Wildcats had possession. Arizona guard Kyle Fogg threw up a desperation three-pointer that didn’t go in.
Game over, right? No.
USC sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic was whistled for what can only be described as an unusual foul call. It sent Fogg to the line for three free throws — all of which Fogg nailed to send the game into overtime.
Let’s just say USC coach Kevin O’Neill wasn’t pleased about the development. After the game, he refused to address the situation directly.
“Everyone knows what happened out there,” O’Neill said in his postgame press conference, according to USCfootball.com. “It’s no secret. Everyone at the game saw what happened and I’m going to leave it at that.”
Vucevic was just puzzled.
“I didn’t touch anything,” he told the Los Angeles Times. “I just went up with my hand in the air so he couldn’t see the basket.”
That was that, and the Trojans moved on to the overtime period with a serious chip on their shoulders.
Only that wasn’t it.
USC was hampered by a number of other calls over the course of the game, including an Arizona shot in the first overtime that appeared to be released after the shot clock expired, but was counted by officials.
In the end the Trojans lost, 86-84, in overtime on a clean layup by Arizona point guard Nic Wise
But the story after the game was more focused on the officiating than anything else.
And that right there, is when you know referees aren’t doing their job.
One of the first things you learn in referee school is to not change the outcome of the game. Essentially, you are a sidenote to the happenings of the matter, not a key part of it.
But, all too often, referees don’t stay true to that. Take Fogg’s shot for example. If the foul hadn’t been called, it’s not like Arizona had much to complain about.
The rule of thumb is that fouls aren’t supposed to be called in a game’s waning seconds unless it is completely obvious.
And that one wasn’t.
Fogg himself said he wasn’t expecting the call afterward, but he gladly took what he could get and ran with it.
Now, go ahead and take a moment to think about all the calls you’ve thought were garbage over the last year or so.
Think through all of USC football’s 13 games, and the basketball team’s 30 contests as well as the other sports played at USC.
And I’m not just saying calls that harmed the Trojans — I can think of plenty calls that favored USC and hurt their opponents.
But how many bad calls can you recall, just from memory?
In October, the Trojans played Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind. The Irish had a fourth-and-two situation from the USC 27-yard line in the first quarter. They used a fake goal to drive down to the two-yard line and set up a touchdown.
But there was an obvious mistake. Notre Dame had a player run to the sideline, who appeared to exit the playing field, but he stayed on.
The Thursday after the game, Pac-10 officiating coordinator Dave Cutaia admitted the refs had made a mistake on the play and two others during the game — including a personal foul call on Taylor Mays that turned out to occur when the opponent was still inbounds.
But there was no benefit for USC after the game, of course. No team ever gets anything when an official admits mistake after the game.
But the Trojans would’ve taken one of those for Saturday’s mishap.

The USC women’s basketball team clinched the third seed in the Pac-10 tournament on Saturday with a comeback victory over Arizona State, 62-52.
USC (18-11, 12-6) used a dominating second half to beat the Sun Devils (17-12, 9-9); the Women of Troy outscored Arizona State 36-19 after halftime.

“We had the same record [as ASU] coming in, and we knew we needed this win,” senior guard Hailey Dunham said. “[It was] tough to be down seven at halftime but to come out with a 10-point win at the end was something we really needed.”
Arizona State seized an early lead in the game on the strength of its inside play. The Sun Devils pounded the ball inside and scored 24 of their 33 first-half points in the paint. USC shot just 30 percent in the first half and entered the break down seven points.
The second half was a different story for the Women of Troy. USC employed a small lineup for much of the second half and harassed the Sun Devils into 15 turnovers and just 19 points.
“We’re not as big as a lot of teams, but Hailey [Dunham] and Christina [Marinacci] are [as] feisty as anybody that’s “6’4”, 6’5”, so I feel comfortable and confident that they can get down there and hold their own,” USC coach Michael Cooper said.
The Women of Troy opened the second half on a tear and tied the score at 43 on a Dunham layup. The game was a back-and-forth affair from then on until USC pulled away late. Redshirt junior guard Jacki Gemelos delivered the knockout punch with a steal and layup that pushed the lead to 52-46 late in the game.
Sophomore guard Ashley Corral said the team changed up its defensive focus after halftime and keyed in on Arizona State guard Danielle Orsillo.
“Just little things like being late on screens, getting hit on screens — we focused on that and executed it,” Corral said.
The Sun Devils shot 26 percent from the field in the second half.
Corral led the Women of Troy with 20 points and three assists. She also added four 3-pointers to further her school record for threes made in a season. Dunham added seven points, six rebounds and some gritty defense down low.
“I think I was outweighed by quite a bit, but I tried to use [my] muscle to bang around down low and try to shut them down,” she said.
Freshman forward Christina Marinacci finished with nine points and seven rebounds. Senior forward Aarika Hughes chipped in nine points in her final regular season game for USC.
“To be among the elites you have to beat the elites, and this was a big, big game,” Cooper said. “It’s always nice to end the season on a positive note because, if you head into a conference championship, you always want to go in on a positive note.”
The Women of Troy set their best conference mark since the 2004-2005 season with the victory. Their 18 wins on the season are the most in four years.
USC earned a first-round bye in the conference tournament and opens up against Oregon in the quarterfinals at 5 p.m. on Friday. The two teams split the regular-season series.

The USC men’s basketball team made sure its final game of the season was one to remember — even without a victory.
After nearly clinching a win in regulation, only to have it snatched away by a questionable call, the Trojans (16-14, 8-10) came up just short in a double-overtime thriller at Arizona on Saturday. USC fell 86-84, bringing an end to a sanctions-shortened campaign and the beginning of a long offseason.

It was the fifth straight loss for a team that can now only watch as the Wildcats (16-14, 10-8) and the rest of its conference foes battle in the Pac-10 tournament, which is scheduled to begin Wednesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. But after the game, first-year coach Kevin O’Neill was quick to praise his players’ energy in what has been USC’s most trying season in recent memory.
“This will be a team I will never forget because you couldn’t be more proud of their effort right till the last buzzer tonight,” O’Neill told ESPN Radio. “I think all Trojan fans can be really proud of these guys.”
As 14,591 audience looked on at the McKale Center in Tucson, Ariz., Wildcats guard Nic Wise made a layup in traffic with 1.5 seconds left, leaving USC time for one last shot. But that layup proved to be the game-winner, as redshirt junior guard Donte Smith missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer.
It might never have come down to that.
With USC leading 69-66, sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic was whistled for fouling Arizona guard Kyle Fogg on an errant 3-point shot with 0.2 seconds remaining in the second half. Fogg proceeded to hit all three free throws, sending the game into overtime.
“Plays that I still can’t believe happened, happened,” O’Neill said.
That wasn’t the only controversial call of the game. Just moments before the tying 3-pointer, Fogg appeared to make a layup after the shot clock expired, but the basket counted. Then on the opening possession of overtime, officials ruled a turnover against USC when an Arizona defender seemingly pushed senior forward Marcus Johnson out of bounds.
The game looked to be slipping away from the Trojans in the first overtime, especially when senior guard Dwight Lewis fouled out with 1:07 left and USC trailing, 77-72. But after Fogg made a free throw, the Trojans responded with six unanswered points to force another overtime.
In the end though, the Wildcats had the final say in a contest that featured nine ties and eight lead changes. Despite facing one of the nation’s stingiest defenses, Arizona shot 47 percent from the field. Fogg and forward Derrick Williams, a former USC recruit, had 18 points apiece for the Wildcats.
Lewis, the Trojans’ all-time leader in games played, scored a game-high 21 points. Also playing in their final games for USC were senior guard Mike Gerrity and Johnson, recording 16 and 13 points, respectively. Redshirt junior forward Alex Stepheson added 14 points and 10 rebounds.
For the Trojans, it was the kind of game they had grown accustomed to in recent weeks.
“It’s unfortunate we lost five in a row at the end of the season, all of them one-possession games going down the stretch,” O’Neill said in his ESPN interview. “We could have easily gone the other way.”
They didn’t in this one, though they came painfully close. That leaves the Trojans waiting until Nov. 13 for another shot at snapping their losing streak when they host UC Irvine in next season’s opener.
But in some ways, Saturday’s game — and the season as a whole — was considered a victory in its own right.
“If you could ever title anything, it was a season of men,” O’Neill said. “These guys acted like men when they’re boys.”
SO. MUCH. BUTTHURT.

If I ever put out a personal ad, I would only need one line: “Single girl in search of funny man.” And because I also like guys with British accents, the idea of a British comedian makes me weak in the knees.
So during my regular midnight session of Googling for the best places to go man hunting, I came across a free open mic night for new London comedians.
The website, comedycafe.co.uk,  boasts “19 years of funny business,” and has hosted the likes of Lee Evans, Ed Byrne and Ricky Grover. Don’t feel bad if you’ve never heard of these comics — truth is neither had I, but the lure of a free comedy show and a chance to meet my future husband convinced me to make the trek across town.
Hidden off the corner of a rather dubious alleyway in Shoreditch, Comedy Café is one of the few purpose-built venues in London.
Every Wednesday night, Londoners have the chance to check out eight up-and-coming comedians starting their difficult climb to the top of the stand-up circuit. The chance of seeing the next Ricky Gervais makes this an event well worth a detour off the beaten path.
With the words “Comedy Café” superimposed onto a graphic resembling the “Pow!” explosions in a comic book marking the doorway, the venue could be easily spotted from down the street. The zany white lettering lit in neon and the psychedelic daisies adorning purple walls are enough to attract attention from even the casual passer-by.
I walked through the crimson doors, expecting to be immediately bombarded by hot men and laugh-out-loud shenanigans. Instead, all I got was a seat in the back of an empty room and an impatient waiter reminding me of the mandatory two-drink purchase ­— not exactly the greatest first impression.
At around 7 p.m., the suggested time of arrival, this comedy club that doubles as a restaurant was only beginning to fill up.
The waiter led my troupe to our seats, plopping the menus — as well as her unapologetic demeanor for the absence of people — in front of us.
With the tables squeezed close together to maximize seating in the small area, our “booth” turned out to be one large table shared with other guests, with our presence practically trapping our neighbors in their seats.
Though they didn’t complain about being cut off from the primary bathroom entrances, we could see them sneak sidelong glances in our direction, as if echoing our own thoughts as to why the rest of the room was empty while we were crammed in the back.
We ordered cheap pints of beer and nachos to tide us over while the room filled up, but before we could enjoy the social aspects of new arrivals the lights dimmed and the host comedian began the show.
Juliet Meyers — the spitting image of Barbara Streisand with ringlet curls — began her comedy career about seven  years ago and has performed sets all over the United Kingdom, including the Leicester Comedy Festival.
At Comedy Café, her approach was interactive. She quickly connected with the largest groups — teachers and activists stage left, the pub-regular business executives stage right and a heckler named Flem in front — and got a few puns in before introducing the first act.
She tested the waters with a couple of mild jokes before slyly asking us for permission to say “the C word.” Before I could wonder what she meant, she had already yelled the offensive four-letter word.
“In London, I feel like nothing is off limits because everyone mixes together,” said Meyers, who claimed American audiences are more shockable.
This matter-of-fact, no-holds-barred comedic style reflects the differences between the British and American experiences more than it reflects differences in humor.
Throughout the night, the newbie comedians made fun of the same sensitive subjects American comedians take on sex, race, homosexuality and drugs. But while their deliveries were similar, the only noticeable difference was in the details.
Instead of jokes about Mexicans crossing borders to steal American jobs, they talked about Ethiopians crossing streets to steal purses from old British ladies. Instead of lazy teenagers smoking marijuana in the woods, they joked about underage ravers snorting horse tranquilizers at clubs.
At times, I had to turn to my British tablemate for a slang translation, winging is the same as whining and slag is a term used to describe a promiscuous girl,  but overall the jokes made their points. Bad comics still struggled to eke a laugh while the good ones sparked laughter as explosive as the sign hanging outside.
Toward the end of the night I was beginning to think the two-drink minimum might have been a smart requirement after all, as it made sitting through the misses all the more bearable and snorting at the hits all the less embarrassing.
Despite all the comedians being male, except for the host, I found that I didn’t want to be any closer to the stage. From my seat, I could escape the heckler backlash and make all the googly eyes I wanted.
Too bad none were really my type.

Last week, student-run Ground Zero Performance Café gave extra meaning to its regular Friday night show. As attendees trickled in for the concert’s 8:30 p.m. kick-off, each walked past a jar for donations set on a table that stood to their right.
Unorthodox · Guitarist and singer Matt Kap of headlining band Moving Picture Show previously voiced interest in playing at USC. The band’s unique influences coalesced to create dancable tunes. - Vicki Yang | Daily Trojan 
First to take the stage was Jessica Mahon — she prefers the moniker Jessica Leigh in the music world — one of Ground Zero’s three “So You Think You’re A Star?” open mic contest winners.
Accompanied by a bassist, guitarist and drummer, Leigh, a freshman majoring in theatre, sat poised at the piano and gave a peppy hello to the audience. Her original song, “The Messy Things,” featured a melancholy bass line, a flitting piano part and lyrics that, with repetition, became emotionally charged. In each song there was a moment when, in a sudden rush of emotion, Leigh displayed her impressive range.
Leigh’s voice suited the lyrics of her songs perfectly, especially her song, “No Exit,” which explained It’s not enough / To fall in love / You have to change your mind / Yes, you have to change your mind.
She offered no easy, repetitive pop beats, which sometimes made her songs difficult to digest, but her talent was apparent.
“It felt absolutely thrilling. It felt kind of like home,” Leigh said after her set. The performer also took advantage of her platform to remind the audience of their opportunity to lend a hand to the quake-ravaged nation of Haiti.
“You have the benefit of saving children tonight,” Leigh said.
For Friday night’s show, Ground Zero teamed up with Save the Children, a non-profit organization that seeks to ensure needy children can grow up in environments where they can be educated, well-nourished and protected. In 2009, the organization provided assistance in 25 different emergencies across the globe. To Kelsey Lynn, Ground Zero’s public relations manager, the collaboration made perfect sense.
“When the earthquake hit Haiti some time ago, we decided in our following meeting that we would like to do something to help out,” Lynn said. “We made plans to transform our open mic concert into a benefit concert. Everyone in our staff really loved the idea of having a charity event, as did the open mic competitors.”
So music and charity converged.
Gian Visciano, an undeclared freshman and the second winner of the “So You Think You’re A Star?” contest, took the stage next, sitting alone on a stool with an acoustic guitar. From his position at the front of the stage, he engaged the audience in a soft voice, quietly speaking to those gathered before beginning his performance.
“You’re completely nervous and there’s something that happens when you’re walking onstage,” Visciano explained. “You get the adrenaline going. There’s a feeling of just being completely into the music, and there’s nothing else like it.”
It was obvious from his performance that Visciano enjoys a close relationship with his art. Singing softly, he managed to pull listeners in with nothing more than his clear investment in which ever song he was singing at that moment. Instead of Visciano’s lack of accompaniment somehow harming the performance, his onstage solitude only engrossed the audience.
His song “Apartment Door” showcases his songwriting skills and performance style.
Oftentimes Visciano lets the guitar convey emotions he didn’t appear able to properly convey with words. He easily alternates between high and low notes, conveying a shift in emotion.
Natalie Angiuli, a sophomore majoring in popular music and theater and a photographer for the Daily Trojan, rounded out the opening performances by open mic contest winners. Her set began with her sweet voice and a ukulele and was later joined by a guitarist, bassist, drummer and violinist.
Her songs melded the country and pop music genres. She sang without affectation and kept the beat with her legs.
Later, she picked up a guitar and then took to the piano, singing lyrics like Well I heard you’re out of rehab / Let’s see if you can stay out.
At one point she covered a segment of Sublime’s “What I Got” and blended it with her own song.
In her song, “Your Name,” she switched to a pop ballad that bordered on rock.
After a short break following Angiuli’s performance, someone started banging on what looked like metal trash cans. Someone else joined in and finally a third person walked out, using trash can lids as large cymbals. The stomp-like interlude served as an introduction to the quirky, rhythmic world of the local band Moving Picture Show.
With a backdrop of Superman cartoon clips and other animated sequences, the trio took the stage. From their unique clothes to their unorthodox beats, the band members filled Ground Zero with original sound and lyrics. The band has taken various experiences and used them as fuel to create music.
Its music lent itself to audience involvement, as evidenced by the widespread headbobbing that characterized audience response to its performance. The songs had traces of electronic, with high electric violin notes starting off one song before the rest of the band cranked up the energy and launched in.
The members of the Century City-based band’s love for what they did was apparent. Funky bass player Jeremy Nesse constantly kept a complicated tune to the song, while drummer Scott Manley created what seemed like dozens of different beats that kept the audience wanting to dance. Matt Kap, confident and energized in his singing, let the notes take hold of him, his face unabashedly expressive and mouth sometimes opening wide to sound off.
The music was the perfect backdrop for the audience members to apply their own thoughts and recall their own experiences while still moving to the beat. The danceable yet heartfelt music seemed a celebration of the experiences that the band members had gone through, and the unadulterated feelings that were expressed showed a recollection of the events that made up their lives.
Kap describes hearing about Ground Zero from a USC alumnus and wanting to play a show there. It seemed each performer’s desire to take the stage was translated into a good cause.
The show had a relatively low turnout, which was unfortunate considering the performers’ immense talent and the great cause. Events like Friday’s show need more USC students in attendance not only to appreciate talent but to help those in need.

When Lane Kiffin took over as the new football coach following Pete Carroll’s departure, he brought along his father, Monte Kiffin, to serve as the team’s defensive coordinator.
Now, he has decided that he wants his younger brother on the sidelines as well.
Chris Kiffin, 28, will serve as a defensive administrative assistant.
“The No. 1 thing for me was going to work for my father. That’s what made it an easy decision for me,” Kiffin told the Los Angeles Times.
This will not be Kiffin’s first experience with the Trojan football team. When he was in college, and his older brother was on the USC coaching staff under Carroll, Chris Kiffin spent summers with the team and worked out with Reggie Bush and Matt Leinart. He also had the opportunity to attend staff meetings and film sessions.
Last season, Kiffin was an offensive intern for the University of Nebraska football team under coach Bo Pelini.
“Obviously, leaving Nebraska is the tough part, because it’s been so great here. Working for Coach Pelini has been so great,” Kiffin told the Lincoln Journal Star.
Kiffin’s father also has ties to the Nebraska team, as he played and lettered there from 1961 to 1963 and also served as an assistant coach from 1966 to 1976.
Chris played four years of college football at Colorado State, where he was a defensive tackle.
USC officials did not confirm that Chris Kiffin was hired.

It’s comforting to know that an awards show celebrating the 2009 film season can still exist without box office darlings Avatar and Sandra Bullock, as the Film Independent Spirit Awards proved Friday evening.
Since its inception in 1984, the Spirit Awards have been dedicated to showcasing and honoring films made outside the studio system. Championing filmmakers who work on a smaller budget, movies are eligible for nomination if the cost of the completed film is less than $20 million.

For its 25th anniversary, the event relocated from its residence in a Santa Monica, Calif., parking lot adjacent to the beach to a more urban and possibly less aesthetically pleasing location — the top floor of a parking lot at L.A. Live, cheekily called the event deck.
“In celebration of [its] 25th anniversary, we moved from a big tent in a parking lot to a big tent on a car park,” commented British comedian and this year’s host Eddie Izzard in his opening monologue.
The event also commemorated the landmark anniversary by highlighting memorable moments from Spirit Awards history in the form of video clips that were scattered throughout the show. Felicity Huffman, Paul Giamatti and Mickey Rourke’s were among the acceptance speeches featured.
Though the voting ballot lacked the familiar Avatar/Hurt Locker matchup — The Hurt Locker’s 2008 premiere made it eligible for last year’s awards — the void was quickly filled by another heralded film, Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire.
Precious, which had its inaugural screening at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and won the competition’s top prizes, follows an illiterate pregnant teenager in 1987 Harlem as she navigates a world of discouragement and abuse. After winning big at the Toronto International Film Festival and the NAACP Image Awards, Precious swept Friday’s event, collecting five prizes in total: best film, directing, first screenplay and lead and supporting female performances.
“Kathryn Bigelow’s not here tonight,” said an elated Lee Daniels when accepting the award for best director. “I am.”
While the film’s cast includes television personalities (Mo’Nique and Sherri Shepard) and music divas (Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz), Precious is the true success story of the season.
“We won already. Tonight’s victory was unexpected,” Daniels said in a press room interview. “And for the Academy to even acknowledge Precious, that’s a win for us.”
“This year has been a dream for me. A year ago, my life was very, very different,” added screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher. “I’m so honored that our film was recognized with so many nominations.”
Featuring a virtual unknown in the leading role and financed independently on a shoestring budget of $10 million, Precious entered the 2009 festival circuit sans a distributor. But with tour de force performances and Daniels and Fletcher’s careful handling of a harrowing subject, the film defied expectations and has found audiences in the most unlikely places.
“After a screening at the DGA, an Asian man came up to me and I could tell he had been crying,” said Mo’Nique, who won the supporting female award for her portrayal of Mary Jones, Precious’ monstrous mother. “He said, ‘What I’m about to say to you is going to sound weird, but I am Mary Jones.’ And I was Mary Jones to my brother and my sister.  We both embraced as he cried in my arms — that’s priceless. I knew his life has been forever changed since watching that piece of art.”
Best female lead winner Gabourey “Gabby” Sidibe, effervescent as ever as she clutched her silver statue, echoed Mo’Nique’s emotional sentiments when discussing the filming of the movie’s intensely dramatic scenes.
“While the cameras were rolling, we were very much in the moment. [If] Mary and Precious are in a fight, we were in that fight. But as soon as Mr. Daniels said cut, we loved each other and hugged each other,” Sidibe said. “I’m not sure we understood what we were doing while we were doing it … It really is a testament to the genius of Mr. Daniels.”
There was also little surprise in the best male lead category: Jeff Bridges garnered yet another statue for his performance as the washed-up, whiskey-swigging country musician Bad Blake in Crazy Heart.
Bridges, who stars in the upcoming Tron Legacy, spoke of the difference between big-budget and independent films.
“They’re very similar sometimes, but perhaps the biggest difference is what really drives independent film is that passion of the filmmaker,” Bridges said. “When you have only 100,000 bucks and stick to it and make a film.”
Crazy Heart also picked up the award for best first feature for producers Robert Duvall, T-Bone Burnett, Rob Carliner, Judy Cairo and Scott Cooper, who also wrote and directed the film.
“I always felt even since the first draft that I had the spirit — the soul — of the piece,” Cooper said. “I just was trying to do what Robert Duvall told me to do, which was just tell the truth.”
Lynn Shelton, who won the Acura Someone to Watch Award in 2009, turned up at the podium this year as winner of the John Cassavetes Award for Humpday, a film she wrote and directed. The prize, which is named after the godfather of independent cinema, is given to a movie made under a $500,000 budget.
“The Spirit Awards have absolutely given us a voice,” Shelton said. “We’re not going to be at the Oscars on Sunday so having a forum that is specifically meant to celebrate this particular canon encourages you to pick up a camera and not wait for studio backing.”
The Seattle native is a powerful figure in the Mumblecore movement and has no doubt been one of the most compelling voices in independent cinema since her debut film, 2006’s We Go Way Back. Although Shelton is reluctant to label herself a “woman director,” she implied that Hollywood is still rather judgmental when it comes to women behind the camera.
“I would like for Kathryn to win [the Oscar], but I don’t think it will change things in the industry,” Shelton said.
Praise for Bigelow was also given by An Education director Lone Scherfig, who called Bigelow “an inspiration.”
While hosting organization Film Independent provides an outlet for offbeat and thoughtfully provocative filmmakers, the Spirit Awards have been criticized in recent years for only recognizing the higher end of independent films. This trend continued last Friday, where most of the films awarded were also those in the Oscar race, evident by the wins for Precious and Crazy Heart as well as An Education and Woody Harrelson for The Messenger.
The true spirit of independence, however, lay with those still new to walking the Spirit Awards’ traditionally blue carpet. In an effort to cultivate and encourage fresh talent, Film Independent hands out three cash prizes for up-and-coming moviemakers each year; these prizes include the Acura Someone to Watch Award, the Piaget Producers Award and the Chaz and Roger Ebert Truer than Fiction Award. The farthest removed from Hollywood and the most unrecognizable faces on the carpet, these filmmakers offered the best advice for those ready to dip their feet into the industry.
“Just go out there and do it,” said the Someone to Watch award winner Kyle Patrick Alvarez. “Jump off the cliff.”

Just when you thought it was over, the doppelganger trend is making a comeback.
Utilizing the format of an iPhone App, the Family Tree website MyHeritage.com has created yet another way for people to actually prove that they look like a celebrity. All you have to do is go to their website, download MyCeleb and upload a photo of yourself. The application — which is free for a limited time — will determine which celebrities you look like the most.
As lame as the concept sounds, the app is actually pretty fun. You get the option of taking a photograph of a friend or using a former photo of someone from your iPhone album. The application then scans the photograph and tells you which famous person you most closely resemble. You can then opt to share the comparison with a quick upload to Facebook or Twitter and annoy all your friends and followers with your apparent vanity.
The problem with MyCeleb is that its system is too fundamental. The celebrity matches vary greatly depending on which way the subject’s head is titled and the angle of the camera because the application focuses more on facial structure than the person’s actual appearance.
This means that girls get matched up with male actors and guys could be told they look like models or Betty White. But the basic design adds to the app’s appeal – it’s embarrassing how easy it is to get caught up in photographing yourself in various positions to try to make MyCeleb match you up with a wide variety of celebrities.
MyCeleb gets boring after about 10 minutes and will soon fade into obscurity soon after being downloaded. But for a college-budget-friendly price of $0, it’s worth the fleeting thrill.
Now we just have to address the meaning behind our culture’s budding obsession with doppelgangers and how we are all seeking validation by comparing our appearances with unattainable ideals of beauty…
Nah, we’ll save that for another day. I’m going to go show my friends that I look exactly like Julia Roberts and Megan Fox.

One of the major contentions in the university setting is that transfer students, specifically from community colleges, have a seemingly unfair advantage over admits that have been at the same university all along. Academically, they seem to be given a “fast pass” to success at the university level: Their easier course credits transfer, along with their GPA based on these courses.
The student who has dutifully studied USC-level course material from freshman year onward might feel undercut with regard to the university’s treatment of these transfers.
Understandably, the decision to transfer is a multifaceted issue and must be approached as such. One would be hard pressed to find someone who resents another student solely because he was a transfer student. But presently, the benefits granted to community college transfers greatly outweigh those granted to students who have attended a four-year university since their first semester of postsecondary education.
Four-year USC students are unfairly restricted in their ability to pursue outside academic options.
Katherine Koehler, a freshman spring admit majoring in art history, attended a junior college the semester before coming to USC. She described her classes there as “really easy,” saying, “the level of difficulty wasn’t up to par with USC’s.”
As the “Transferring to USC” brochure claims, “Seventy-five percent of your transferable courses should satisfy General Education or other core requirements, or subject prerequisites for your intended major.” Now, those of us who have taken G.E.s at USC or other prerequisite courses know they are some of the more difficult classes most have to attend. It would be a considerable boon to be able to take these at an easier level.
The university holds inconsistent principles with regard to these courses: On the one hand, it encourages transfer students and spring admits to knock out as much of the core as possible before coming to the university, while on the other, those already enrolled at the university may no longer take core courses anywhere but USC.
So what then should the university change? Is it fair to demand that a student transferring in his junior year retake what amounts to a year’s worth of classes? We could call it a penalty on the indecisive, but this doesn’t take into account exceptional cases where students planned to transfer all along. In addition, implementing this policy would place extra strain on the university in that it would have to open up a substantially larger number of slots in G.E. courses to accommodate transfers who would most likely be learning redundant material anyway.
Also, we must consider this issue from the perspective of transfer students. If they go to community college with the ultimate plan of transferring into ’SC, what classes should they take to prepare? G.E.s seem the most logical choice; these are less relevant to their majors, so the transition between community college and USC should be correspondingly less important.
The solution then should be to allow all students to fulfill G.E. requirements at USC or elsewhere so that those who want to capitalize on the less strenuous curricula of community colleges would be able to do so. Students who enter as freshmen in the fall should not be punished for their timely matriculation, and neither should transfers be punished for planning ahead academically.
In this way, everyone wins; because all options are available, everyone can choose what best suits him or her.
Reid Roman is a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering.
Wow, I cannot believe how negative the comments are. Reid, you’re absolutely right – it makes no sense that once you’re admitted to USC you can no longer take any GEs outside of the school, yet transfers can bring in all (or most?) of their GEs! 
I’m sorry, but I’ve attended courses over summers at community colleges and they are not usually as difficult as USC courses. 
USC needs to level the playing field so that all students can take advantage of  the low-cost opportunities available at community colleges.
Community college is a joke. I don’t know why USC wants these transfer students. They don’t curve grades at community college, the exams are easier than when I was in high school, and like 90% of the students there fall asleep or don’t show up to class. I know, I took a foreign language class (because my g/f is Japanese) there last fall at Santa Monica College because I don’t want to pay the tuition here, nor does my major require it. I didn’t even study and aced that class, that’s how EASY their academic standards are. 
These double standards must end.
I entered USC as a transfer with a combination of CC classes and four year credits, but most of my credits came from a four year school ranked far lower than USC. To my surprise I ended up graduating with a significantly higher USC GPA than my transfer GPA I came in with.  Perhaps I was more driven, passionate and motivated in those two years and a half year at ‘SC. Nevertheless, some of the classes I’ve taken prior to transfer were just as rigorous if not more than those I took at ‘SC. In addition in my major, I had to completely retake all the classes I had taken in the same major at my prior school. So I gave up a lot just to be a Trojan. It was very redundant and mind  numbing to have to retake the same crap over.  So don’t judge and say its easier for transfers. Many of us have a chip on our shoulder and weren’t as privileged as you who entered as freshmen. We had to hustle hard and never give up to fulfill our dreams of making it to a top tier school.  On a final note, I am proud to be one of those statistics from studies that show that transfer students perform at least as well if not better than their peers.  
To all those who endured the strugle, sacrifice and process of transferring and earning Trojan Laurels, Fight on!! The world is yours!!!
Geez, this guy is good at sensationalizing his article. Oh my GOSH!!!! Look at all these indignant responses!
Hey people, just chill. This guy is probably ROFL.
As a JC student who has worked his ass off to get a 3.9+ gpa just so I might have a slight chance at being admitted as a junior transfer this next fall, I am incredibly insulted by this article. As a non-traditional student, I had no choice but to enroll at a JC first before transferring to a 4 year as no 4 year would admit me as a freshman. 
I really hope that the rest of the USC student body does not share the same opinion expressed by the author of this Article.
As a recent alumnus who happened to transfer to USC, I am thoroughly insulted by this article. I could go over the fundamental flaws of the argument, but previous commentators have pretty much covered all the bases. Instead, I would like to offer a word of advice. In your future, before you start bashing any idea, topic, etc. be extra sure to have all the facts, and at least understand the opposing side of an argument. Although I am sure you did not mean to, you just alienated an important part of the USC family, insulted many of your peers, and embarrassed the university with an article that reads more like it came from a High School Freshman.
Fight On Reid!
No one is twisting anyone’s arm to come to USC as a freshman.  If you believe you can get a better deal, ie: easier classes/inflated GPA at a JC, then GO FOR IT!  I’m sure if you took a poll of community college transfer students at USC, the majority would prefer the timely matriculation you speak of, if given the opportunity.  There are pros and cons to each side and I believe the university has done a fair job in evening out the scales rather than tipping them any further in favor of incoming freshmen, who already have a leg up by being admitted as freshmen.
Reid-
Perhaps before you go bashing the transfer system, you should take your time and actually interview more than one person who has transferred to USC, and not simply a Spring Admit. You clearly have not done your research. I attended a 4 year college for one semester, realized it was not the school for me, enrolled in a JC, and finally transferred to SC in my Junior year. You think all that was easy? Imagine the application process you went through in high school….now imagine doing that not once, but two more times. Picking classes that would transfer over was not an easy process either. Is it wrong to want to take GE’s that transfer over so that I won’t be stuck paying USC tuition when I’m a 6th year undergrad? As a freshman I do not really feel that you should be writing an article like this. You have been in college for 7 months. I have been in college for almost 4 years. Congratulations on being accepted the first time around, but please do not lump all “transfers” together and assume the process was easy. I really wish you would have interviewed me first and gotten a real perspective on the situation.
Can you support the claim that transfer credits almost always meet requirements for a USC major or GE course? There’s a difference between receiving units and opting out of a GE category like Arts and Letters. In this sense, transfers are at a huge disadvantage. California community colleges have paths designed to help their students transfer to a UC or CSU, and these schools have completely different GE requirements then USC. A transfer student can come into USC and be forced to take entirely GE’s and classes toward their major, as they have used all their elective credit that could have gone to a minor or double major.
Most significantly, I think the premise of this article is fundamentally flawed. If transfer students liked taking easy classes and getting A’s then they would never have transferred in the first place. Believe it or not, some people chose USC not just for how it looks on their resume, but because of what they can gain from their courses. Any freshman admitted Trojan wanting to take community college classes rather then take advantage of the wealth of academic resources at hand probably should just drop out, save their money, and give their spot to someone who actually wants it.
Mr. Roman, I commend you for entering USC as a freshman. It clearly demonstrates that you achieved both a competitive GPA and SAT score during high school, and, that you must’ve done lots of extracurriculars. And, I agree that incoming freshmen got it tougher than jr. college (JC) transfers. I’m a “lowly” JC-transfer and I did have an inflated GPA at JC. Yeah, the academic rigor, standards and competition here contrasts dramatically with that of a JC. But, what you you overlook are the advantages that incumbent udergrads like you have over typical JC-transfers. You guys/gals are showed the ropes and conditioned with “real” college life i.e. dorms, parties, developing friends since freshmen year, getting the upperhand on extracurriculars and internships, and so forth. We, at JC, or should I say? “quasi-high school” wannabe college don’t experience all that.
So, before you act all supercilious towards JC-transfers, and how they get the easy-route into ‘SC, think of all the advantages you have over them.
Haha good point – “aintmadatcha”
Those who start as freshmen over here have a really big advantage in terms of the college freshman experience, and the diversity of friends they have. JC is full of part-time students, and it is a bit difficult to make friends from the class. When you transfer into USC, and decide to live in an apartment, you realize that most of the friends you make are based on your field of study.
My kids have both attended community college before attending USC. Overall, they found the coursework and competition very easy at community college. My daughter said she was “amazed” that she got an A in Anthro  with almost “no work” and an A in English composition easily, with little work
My youngest child just began going to community college this year. So far, in one of his classes, the instructor has unilaterally “cancelled” three sessions so far due to personal business. There are no subs in the system as they “can’t afford” subs according to the head of the department. She told me “this will never happen again” then we got an email the following week of another class being cancelled.
In all my years at uni i do not recall profs cancelling classes like this.
This is not to say that community colleges do not have pluses. My youngest son has been pleased and happy there minus the cancellations.
I agree.  Reid, your reporting is simply shoddy on this one.  First of all, transfers do not get to keep there GPA when they transfer, so there is no “unfair” advantage as you say.  The university policy is that a transfer student’s USC GPA will be the LOWER of either his university GPA or the combination of his university GPA and transfer GPA.  So , once at USC, a transfer is on the same level with everyone who has already matriculated.
Secondly, your shoddy journalism makes no mention of how difficult it is to transfer to USC in the first place.  This has nothing to do with “easy” courses.  Transfer students apply like everyone else and are not admitted simply because they have a high GPA and took these so called “easy” courses.
Third, simply because a student takes a class at a community college does not mean that it will even transfer.  Community colleges and the university have carefully scrutinized the curriculum, and only when USC’s exacting standards have been met does the university add a course to its articulation agreement for that respective course and school.
In the future, do your homework before you write an article.  I know being a freshman in industrial and systems engineering is difficult and time consuming, but this is no excuse for your laziness when writing this article.
Reid, you should stick to industrial and systems engineering, because journalism is clearly not in your future.
As a transfer student myself, I find this article completely ridiculous.  You use one students personal experience to come to an overly general and incorrect assumption.
Some classes taken at Community College are very easy, just like some classes taken at USC.  Some classes taken at USC are very hard, just like some classes taken at Community College.
To categorically decree that all classes taken at California Community Colleges are somehow inferior to those taken at USC for the sole reason that this IS the University of Southern California is short sighted, ignorant, and ultimately, incorrect.
Reid, you clearly have no concept of articulation agreements and petitions.  As a transfer student, I was required to petition the University to accept Community College credit for certain courses by submitting a course syllabus and sample coursework.  Classes that were deemed inadequate, I did not receive credit for.
The University of Southern California is one of the premier academic institutions in the country.  However, it is naive for Reid, and others, to systematically assume that ALL classes taken at California Community Colleges are inadequate and that this somehow punishes freshman admits.  Reid fails to realize that freshman admits have a huge advantage over transfer students when it comes to forming relationships with professors and academic advisers, acquiring campus housing, and getting a job on campus.
The assumption that the perceived “advantage” gained by Community College transfer students somehow outweighs the many advantages of being a freshman admit is unfounded and irresponsible.  The way the University currently handles transfer credits is sensible, adequate, and fair.

I’ve always been impressed with people who can smile with their eyes on command. When a photographer says, “Cheese,” their zygomatic major muscles lift the corners of their mouth, their orbicularis oculi muscles raise their cheeks and form crow’s feet around their eyes and they look so unbelievably happy.
I don’t usually force a smile when someone tells me to say, “Cheese” — I feel ridiculous feigning bliss on command. I smile in photographs but rarely with my teeth and never with my eyes. I guess that means I’m going to die sooner than people who really mean it.
A study published in Psychological Science late last month found that professional baseball players from the ’50s were more likely to reach the age of 80 if they sported Duchenne smiles in their official photographs — that is, smiles that involved both the mouth and the eye muscles. Researchers at Wayne State University also found that players with non-Duchenne smiles, those restricted to the mouth muscles, outlived those who didn’t smile at all.
With yearbooks coming out soon, it could be possible to predict the longevity of any graduating senior at USC. But for now, check out your student I.D. photograph or your Facebook profile picture.
How intense is your smile?
Scientists think Duchenne smiles indicate genuine happiness because it’s hard to contract the orbicularis oculi muscles around the eyes at will.
Past studies have found that Duchenne smiles can predict other positive life outcomes, such as marital success. Last year, a DePauw University study found that people who sported genuine, toothy grins in their yearbook pictures were more likely to have successful marriages than people with non-Duchenne smiles or those who didn’t smile at all. The latter were more likely to divorce.
However, the interpretation of studies like these has been somewhat misleading.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
Ernest Abel and Michael Kruger, authors of the Psychological Science study, speculated that perhaps people with intense smiles in their photographs lived longer than people with weak or non-existent smiles because they are generally happier during their lives. They are “more likely to experience the health benefits of happiness, which has been linked with lower levels of stress hormones and a protein implicated in heart disease,” according to a New Scientist article about the study.
Although a smile that involves the eyes is probably a more accurate indicator of genuine happiness than a smile that involves only the mouth, most people who are aware they are getting their photographs taken are smiling on command. If anything, the intensity of your smile in a photograph reveals how good you are at faking happiness — not how happy you actually are.
After all, actors and actresses sport Duchenne smiles in their photographs all the time.
Other scientists have speculated that the reason Duchenne smiles in photographs predict longevity and other positive life outcomes is because they may reflect the person’s sociability. People who are better at conjuring expressions of happiness are better able to establish strong social networks.
I can buy this interpretation because research has established that the more friends you have, the more likely you are to live a long, healthy, happy life.
Matt Hertenstein, a psychologist at DePauw University who led the study about smile intensity and marital success, said he thinks the correlation between Duchenne smiles and positive life outcomes might be caused by conscientiousness. Perhaps people who give big, toothy grins in their photographs are simply more willing to obey a photographer when he tells them to say, “Cheese.”
This, too, makes sense. People who follow the rules are less likely to engage in unhealthy activities like smoking, drinking and other substance abuse. Conscientious Duchenne smilers are probably more willing to try to work through problems in an unhappy marriage or put on a happy face and pretend everything is okay, rather than get a divorce.
Also, conscientious people are more likely to have better social networks than non-conscientious people. They are more willing and able to convey the emotions they know they’re supposed to convey and conform to the expectations of a group.
So no matter what type of smile style you have in pictures, there’s reason to be proud of yourself.
If you’re a Duchenne smiler, you can rejoice because you’ve got a 70 percent chance of reaching the age of 80, as opposed to the 50 percent chance that non-smilers have. And if you’re not so great at smiling in pictures, at least you can be satisfied in knowing that you are a nonconformist.
After all, Einstein and Tolstoy and many other brilliant minds throughout history look miserable in most of their photographs and portraits.

In his 17 years as athletic director, Mike Garrett hasn’t been the school’s most personable employee to the Trojan faithful.
And in a year when fans desperately seek to hear from the man who placed self-imposed sanctions on the men’s basketball team, has had coaching changes in his two highest revenue-producing sports and heads a program that has potential NCAA violations looming over it, Garrett has often taken the high road, hiding behind newspaper headlines and media scrutiny.
Yet, in a period where Garrett’s leadership has come under fire for a lack of institutional control and a laissez-faire attitude in regard to high-profile sports, USC’s athletic director has decided to change course and unveil his personal feelings regarding any and all news associated with Trojans’ athletics for the first time.
With the help of the USC Rips It blog, Garrett has the opportunity to change the elusive persona he has created during his tenure at USC. And from the feedback from his first post, it appears he may be well on his way to doing just that.
In his first tell-all of the “From the Desk of the A.D.” series, Garrett touched on such issues as the NCAA hearings, expansion in the Pac 10, the academic successes of USC’s student athletes and football’s upcoming Spring Practice.
In regard to the NCAA proceedings, the former- Heisman trophy winner said, “We’re glad we were able to present our case to the NCAA officials. We think that we presented our case very well and we eagerly await the outcome.”
But in likely his most genuine portion of the blog post, Garrett relayed to fans that the program, both from an athletic and academic standpoint, will never rest on its laurels despite past accomplishments.
“As successful as our student-athletes were in the fall, we’re always striving for more triumphs — both in the classroom and on the field. As Trojans, we must never rest or be satisfied with status quo, no matter how good it may be.”
In less than 24 hours after Garrett’s words hit the web, the reviews came pouring in from fans delighted to hear from the voice of the athletic program. From “Fight on AD Garrett” to “great addition to the blog” to “good to see Garrett more visible,” it’s hard to argue with the positive impact this 180 degree transformation will have on a program that has undergone such turmoil the past 12 months.
