The No. 4 men’s water polo team returned home to take on No. 7 UC Irvine Sunday afternoon and put the Anteaters away with a dominant 14-8 victory on Senior Day.
“It’s really important for us to go out with a win for our seniors,” junior Blake Edwards said.  “They’ve done a lot of work, they are really great guys, and the team loves them.”
The afternoon’s festivities began with a ceremony honoring the team’s two graduating seniors: Gerrit Hall and Mac Carden.  Hill is a transfer who has spent his past two years on the team.  Carden is a fifth year senior and won two national championships in his time at USC.
“It’s great [to get a win], but it’s sad at the same time because it’s one of our last home games,” Carden said. “This whole team is like your family now, but it’s been a pretty sweet run.”
Carden is also revered by his fellow teammates as a role model and leader.
“Mac is a really good leader, he’s a friend to everyone, he’s very supportive,” Edwards said.  “He’s always open to talk, particularly to the young guys, he’s done a lot of work mentoring them throughout the season.”
With the win, the Trojans moved to 6-2 in MPSF conference play and 18-4 overall. It also ends a two-game losing streak.
“We worked extremely hard this week, we worked on a lot of stuff, but we still have a lot to work on,” Edwards said.
The Trojans found their offensive rhythm in a game that showcased their high scoring capabilities.  After shaking off a slow start, the Trojans and the Anteaters were neck-and-neck after the first period with the Trojans up 3-2.
USC opened up the gap during the second period, in which they outscored UCI 5-1.
“Throughout the season our defense has been our best stat, and the past few games the other offense has really hurt us,” Edwards said.
Sophomore goalie McQuin Baron stood tall in goal for USC with 11 saves on the day.  The defense turned into offense for the Trojans, who were led by Edwards. He finished the day with four goals.
“All the work was done beforehand starting with good defense, good transition, good balance,” Edwards said.  “Then the person who made the pass, they were really well executed passes, and I just had to put the ball away it was quite easy.”
Edwards wasn’t the only Trojan who found his groove, as the plethora of USC goals was spread throughout the team.  Sophomore Matteo Morelli finished the game with a hat trick.  Freshman James Walters and sophomore Grant Stein each connected twice for USC, and three other Trojans netted single goals to cap off the Trojans scoring spree.
Looking ahead, the Trojans will head across town to take on the No. 1 UCLA Bruins next Sunday in Westwood.  The team is expecting a hard week of practice leading into the teeth of their schedule beginning with UCLA, and continuing on to the MPSF tournament and the NCAA championships.

It was a successful homecoming Weekend for the No. 2-ranked women’s volleyball team, which came away victorious against Colorado (3-1) and Utah (3-0) at the Galen Center to push their record to 25-1 on the season. The Women of Troy also remain atop the Pac-12 standings with a 13-1 mark in conference play.
Neither of the mountain schools could keep up with USC’s quick pace over the weekend, as the Women of Troy bested the Buffs in four sets on Friday night, (25-12, 25-14, 25-27, 25-23) before going on to sweep the Utes (25-13, 25-22, 25-20) on Sunday morning. USC remained undefeated all-time against Colorado, while upping their record against Utah to 15-2 overall. The Women of Troy also remained undefeated in matches played at the Galen Center this season at 13-0.
It was another impressive string of matches for the leading National Player of the Year candidate in senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio, who averaged 25.75 points on the weekend in just seven total sets of play. The senior recorded 42 kills (6 kills per set) with only 7 combined errors for a .422 hitting percentage overall. She also tallied 14 digs, seven service aces and five blocks against the Mountain schools to bolster her numbers as the nation’s top scorer.
Head coach Mick Haley was not surprised at his senior captain’s impressive numbers.
“If you look at the teams that have gone to the Final Four in the last 6 or 7 years, everybody’s had a go-to person…somebody that makes it okay for everybody else and takes the team on their back when they need to,” Haley said. “Samantha’s been a good player for us for three years, and she is leading this team, not only by example but [also] encouragement.”
Bricio also had some strong support from her teammates over the weekend. Fellow senior Alicia Ogoms tallied 15 total kills and just one error on 25 swings in the middle to go along with a team-high 9 blocks, while sophomore opposite Brittany Abercrombie recorded 18 kills and just 4 errors for a .378 hitting clip. Furthermore, freshman outside hitter Alyse Ford added 17 total kills, while junior middle blocker Elise Ruddins recorded 8 blocks overall.
The setting tandem of junior Alice Pizzasegola and freshman Baylee Johnson also put up strong all-around numbers, with Pizzasegola dishing out 35 assists, 12 digs and a service ace on the weekend, while Johnson had a combined 53 assists, 21 digs, six kills and five total blocks. The backcourt duo of junior libero Taylor Whittingham and freshman defensive specialist Victoria Garrick once again remained steady, picking up 35 and 19 digs, respectively, to anchor USC’s defense.
The Women of Troy will now remain at home to prepare for two more matches in the middle of the week. USC hosts the Oregon schools back-to-back, facing the Oregon Ducks on Wednesday and the Oregon State Beavers on Thursday. Both matches will start at 7:30 p.m. at the Galen Center.
In addition, Bricio is now just 22 kills away from setting USC’s all-time record for career kills. She trails current record holder Alex Jupiter (1,918; 2008-11) and will more than likely move into 10th place in Pac-12 history for career kills within the next two matches.

Beat the Bruins · Before Friday’s 2-0 win, the No. 14-ranked Women of Troy were 0-15 all-time against the Bruins in Westwood. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The women’s soccer team capped off an impressive regular season with an emphatic 2-0 road win over UCLA.
The Women of Troy (14-5-1) entered the game as the No. 14 team in the land. USC’s play in this game, as well as the team’s body of work all season, legitimized that lofty ranking. The Women of Troy bullied a UCLA team that was really struggling to put the pieces together during the latter stage of the season.
The Bruins (8-10-1) endured a down year after having lost just one game in each of the past two seasons. UCLA captured the national title in 2013 and came close to repeating the following season, but 2015 was not so kind to USC’s crosstown rival.
On Friday night, the Bruins had the chance to make a statement against a favored USC team. For the majority of the game, the two sides were on level pegging. It was a tremendous fixture to watch for the record-breaking crowd at UCLA’s Drake Stadium. Back and forth they went, nothing to choose between them.
The match was deadlocked at 0-0, as a record 6,253 fans held their breath.
Then the Trojans decided to take matters into their own hands.
USC strung together a terrific offensive move in the 73rd minute. After excellent possession to advance the ball into the final third, right back Kayla Mills drilled a low cross to Morgan Andrews. Andrews coolly tucked the ball into the back of the net. She made the finish look easy, maintaining her composure in front of the goal and giving USC a much-needed score.
In a tense game, the junior midfielder was seemingly immune to the pressure. She was clearly enjoying herself out there, dictating the flow of play and controlling the middle of the park.
She had given the visitors the lead, but the game was still on a knife’s edge. However, Andrews was not done yet.
Just six minutes later, she doubled the lead on a beautiful volley from inside the area. Sydney Johnson served an aerial ball into the box, but Andrews still had a lot to do. She made a clean connection and powered it home to give USC a massive win. It is safe to say that her volley will be in USC’s conversation for goal of the year.
UCLA played with energy, but the Bruins did not have an answer for Andrews. The Notre Dame transfer has been unstoppable this season, and her performance against the Bruins on Friday night was no exception.
The Women of Troy have quite a bit of momentum as they prepare for the NCAA Tournament, but they also have all of the fundamentals to win the national title this year.
It all starts with the goalkeeping. It is virtually impossible to win games, let alone the NCAA tourney, without outstanding play from the netminder. Sammy Jo Prudhomme has posted 10 shutouts this season and has made clutch saves when her number is called. Against UCLA, Prudhomme came up huge in the second half when she made a leaping save to the near post, keeping the Bruins off the score sheet.
The game was 0-0 at that point. If Prudhomme had not made that acrobatic save, the outcome of this game could obviously have been different.
The back line is also resembling a fortress at the moment. Perfection is impossible, but the defense’s steady play against UCLA was pretty close to flawless. The team’s possession-oriented style means that Prudhomme often opts to roll the ball out to her defenders, who are all comfortable in possession.
The back line then looks to connect high-percentage passes to midfielders Mandy Freeman, Nicole Molen and Morgan Andrews. Freeman plays the role of center defensive mid, while Andrews and Molen are given more license to roam. Molen is tireless in the middle and rarely exits matches to catch a breather and Andrews is one of the most dominant players in college soccer.
The play from wingers and the center forward has also been incredibly promising. There is a steady rotation among the forwards in this 4-3-3 formation, with all contributors bringing a unique skillset to the table.
With a well-rounded, explosive team, the table is set for head coach Keidane McAlpine to lead his team on a national title run.
Great to beat the ‘ruins anytime in any sport. Congratulations to the Women of Troy, and good luck in the playoffs. This time indirectly Notre Dame helped USC with the transfer Andrews making the difference all season.

Nine games into the 2015 college football season, and it appears the Trojans finally have an identity.
Though not quite at the level of Stanford or Alabama yet, USC is finally back on the road to playing power football. The win over Arizona was significant for a wide array of reasons: the Trojans showed resilience after going down by 14, they won their third straight game for the first time this year, and most importantly, their performance offered a blueprint for the future success of the program.
It is still too early to say whether or not head coach Clay Helton should have his interim tag removed, but one thing is for certain, the players fight for him. Earlier this season, if the Trojans had fallen into a 14-0 hole, I don’t think they would have responded favorably. On Saturday night, they rallied behind their coach; flying to the ball on defense and attacking Arizona defenders on offense.
Helton is still learning — his use of timeouts and love for the outside bubble screen leave a lot to be desired — but he motivates his players, which means a lot. Sometimes, when you have a team as talented as the Trojans are, the only thing you need to win is for your players to play hard. I think that was the case Saturday night.
The win means a lot for the Trojans as the momentum builds going into the Colorado game. If they can avoid the trap game on a sleepy Friday night in Boulder, USC will be playing for real stakes deep into November. Though it isn’t the season many fans envisioned at the outset of the year, the team is in a much better position than even the most optimistic fan could have reasonably predicted after the loss to Notre Dame.
More important than this season, though, is the future of the Trojans program. While the glitz and glamour of the spread offense is alluring, it is very clear that the power run game is still lethally effective when employed correctly. USC doesn’t have all the assets in place, and hasn’t faced the most physical of defensive lines the last few weeks, but they have the makings for a potent recipe for success moving forward.
Saturday night demonstrated the multitude of benefits associated with a clock dominating, power running game. When JuJu Smith-Schuster left the game in the third quarter, the team had no choice but to put the ball in the hands of running backs Justin Davis and Ronald Jones. They were rewarded with a mix of power and speed, carving the Wildcats’ defense up.
Much like Chauncey Washington did many years ago, and Silas Redd did more recently,  Davis and Jones acted as closers in the fourth quarter. They were able to effectively shorten the game by taking a powerful Wildcat offense off the field for long periods of time in the late third and fourth quarter.
Jones, who is a true freshman, has the kind of acceleration the Trojans haven’t seen since Reggie Bush. While he is not in that rarified air yet, his career has the potential to be something truly special. His penchant for minor injuries that lead to him limping each week is a slight cause for concern, but they haven’t really affected his performance, so hopefully that trend continues.
Davis has finally put together a string of performances that resembles the immense potential he flashed freshman year before getting hurt. He doesn’t run so much as glide, and when there is a crease he is excellent at turning it into something extra.
Neither of these guys fit the bruising mold, but having a Lendale White isn’t necessary when the team has a powerful and large offensive line. Having a center with a lower center of gravity has done wonders for the Trojans’ run game, and maybe Khaliel Rodgers has played himself into a permanent role when all is said and done this season.
USC doesn’t need to be Arkansas. They can still involve their dynamic athletes, like they did tonight with Smith-Schuster and Adoree’ Jackson. This just makes them more explosive and hard to defend, but I honestly believe the team will be more successful over the next five to 10 years if they become the bully again. The best years of the Caroll era had excellent receivers and tight ends who put up great statistics, but the core of the team was five offensive lineman who played professionally, a veteran quarterback who was accurate and didn’t make mistakes and phenomenal running backs.
That is a recipe for success when the talent is there. Just look at Alabama or Stanford. Both of those teams are consistently in the hunt. USC can recruit more talented guys than Stanford and beat them at their own game, and ascend to the ranks of Alabama, LSU and Michigan State.
It seems the most successful people and groups go left when everyone else is going right. College football is transitioning the spread, so maybe USC should go back to its roots to find its identity. Saturday night was definitely a step in the right direction.

For the kids · Sophomore Mary Richardson, left, and junior Andie Furber, right, pose with milk jugs used to collect donations during Saturday’s game. – Photo courtesy of USC Troy Camp
Students passed milk jugs around the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during Saturday’s Homecoming football game against Arizona while donating funds to support local kids in the community. The drive was a part of Troy Camp’s annual Pass the Can fundraiser.
Founded in the 1970s, Pass the Can is one of Troy Camp’s oldest fundraising traditions. The money raised from Pass the Can goes directly toward sending elementary school students to a week-long summer camp in the San Bernardino Mountains.
This year, director of fundraising for Pass the Can Lauren Jacobs contacted a variety of sponsors and different student organizations to help out with the event.
“We’ve been planning Pass the Can since June by reaching out to various people on and off campus,” Jacobs said. “Without the help of small businesses, student volunteers and the Athletics Department, this wouldn’t have been possible.”
In addition to using social media, Jacobs also spread the word through simple word of mouth.
“Many Troy Camp counselors are involved in other clubs as well, so we relied on them to raise awareness about the event,” Jacobs said. “This year we had about 1,200 volunteers sign up to collect donations from people in the stands.”
In addition to bringing volunteers to the game, Troy Camp also brings local youth to give them the experience of a college football game. Claire Chatinover, director of yearlong programming, said local youth enjoy being part of the event.
“The kids love coming to Homecoming because they get to see their friends again and cheer on our football team with pom-poms, megaphones and posters,” Chatinover said. “They also get to see the passing of the jugs firsthand and the impact it has across the stadium.”
For the 20 minutes that the jugs are passed around during halftime, Troy Camp can get up to $25,000 in donations. Volunteers wearing “Pass the Can” t-shirts work hard to spread the word about Troy Camp and the programs they provide for students in South Los Angeles.
“It’s really an incredible scene to watch,” Jacobs said. “In just 20 minutes, over 90,000 people are suddenly aware of the organization that we are so passionate about, and they take part in making a difference.”
Every penny from Pass the Can goes toward funding Troy Camp’s summer camp at the end of the year. Counselors and students get to spend a week participating in archery, horseback riding, swimming and other fun educational activities.
“For many of the kids, it’s the first time they will get to see stars,” Chatinover said. “We are so grateful to the USC community for helping out and giving the kids an opportunity like this.”

A comparative study of LGBT resource centers at top academic institutions found that USC’s, at 169 square feet, is the smallest in the country for schools that have such centers.
In theory, the center serves 4,000 students, according to Alyssa Coffey, executive director of the Queer and Ally Student Assembly. The center’s director, Rev. Kelby Harrison, led the research project last year to see how USC compared to other major universities.
The study found that the average size of LGBT resource centers is about 1,200 square feet. Rutgers University’s LGBT center, which is the second smallest after USC, has an area of 700 square feet. Harrison said that, despite being below average, Rutgers’s center still has a study lounge, offices and a reception area, far surpassing its USC counterpart.
“[Our] space is not just small. It is embarrassing,” Harrison said. “We also looked at the California fire code [regulations], and 169 square feet should only have eight occupants at any given time. We have seven employees that work here, six students and me. Which means that at any given time we’ve maxed out our code should all of my staff show up.”
Harrison explained how the center’s small size affects the LGBT community as a whole.
“For retention and for the psychological flourishing of the LGBT community, students need a space that feels welcoming, that feels like a living room, a place you can come to and study and relax and meet people and hang out with friends and just be you,” Harrison said. “While it is colorful and identity affirming, it isn’t that kind of relaxed space.”
Harrison argued that because they hold meetings and student workers are always at the office, the LGBT center is not a space to “drop in,” but more of a space for the “business of the center itself.” She also said that this has led them to do programming in other locations around campus, such as the Office of Religious Life, Taper Hall and the Von Kleinsmid Center.
“[This] means that we don’t have all our pamphlets on hand, we don’t have our educational materials or our historical materials nearby,” Harrison said. “We are just back in a vacant University space.”
Harrison also commented on how the LGBT center’s relative success may be an impediment to it gaining additional resources. She said that because the center does a “great job on paper” and meets many of the benchmarks in institutional indexes, the higher administration could be overlooking needs that should be met.
“We’re doing too good of a job, so they don’t notice how poorly this center is actually serving our students,” Harrison said. “It’s a paradox of sorts.”
Coffey explained that a year ago the LGBT resource center had a brief opportunity for expansion. After the Center for Women and Men moved to the Engemann Student Health Center, Coffey said, it gave its unused office space to the LGBT resource center. But at the end of the last school year, Associate Vice Provost for Student Affairs, Division Initiatives and Operations Timothy Bessolo was involved in the decision over how to repurpose the space, and it was decided that it would be turned into an Innovation Lab and a space for Student Affairs staff.
“We had a much-needed ability to expand into that office, and they were just taking it away without consulting with students or even the director of the resource center,” Coffey said. “It was a decision that came down from the top.”
In protest, members of the center and the LGBT community staged a demonstration at the center in July. More than two dozen students crowded the small room, breaking fire code.
“I think [administrators] think they care,” Coffey said. “Every time that students show [the administration] ways in which they could be better supported, it’s a bureaucratic spiral, and nothing ever happens.”
Bonnie Johnson, a graduate student working at the LGBT center, talked about her undergraduate experience at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and how expanding the center will require students to be more passionate.
“Back home, all the LGBT kids would kind of gather together [at the LGBT resource center] and be really passionate because everyone on campus treated them like sh*t,” Johnson said. “Here, because all the LGBT or queer kids are not as persecuted, they seem to be more defocused. There’s not a huge presence at the center.”
“Expanding the center will require students to be more passionate”- except that the queer experience isn’t at its core a “club”, it’s our reality whether we want it or not! How ignorant. Queer students, especially in an environment of big money, white prominence, and an LGBT-uneducated student body, are likely to feel discouraged to participate in extracurriculars. I can’t speak for the state of USC’s resources today, but as recent as 2013 (my graduation year), very few events were focused on anything other than the “G” or “L”. Thankfully, Vincent and the student leaders were receptive, and I did see more intersectionality incorporated into the programs over the years via Facebook updates. But I can’t stress enough how necessary a “safe space” is to those who aren’t as willing to fraternize with the party-lovers in the student groups. Alcoholism and drug issues, especially within the transgender population at USC, went unnoticed, yet were nearly enough to almost end my own life. My friends and I still reluctantly attended events put on by QuASA, but we did so because there was no alternative. Even events billed as “dry” or “educational” were guaranteed to have the majority of members pre-gaming before-hand, making socializing hard for those uninterested or recovering. 
This is more than just an issue of office space- students NEED a place to go when everything and everyone else on campus fails them. The idea that it’s their responsibility to “rally” for this space only demonstrates how little the administration at USC understands the reality of the queer collegiate experience. A truly welcoming resource center would act as far more than just a Hang-Out Space- it could undoubtedly save lives, offer back-up when coming out leaves students disowned, or simply give leads on jobs.
As an alumnus who worked adjacent to student affairs, I know for a fact they don’t need extra space. Good reporting on this, though I’d like to hear from actual LGBT students who use the resource, not just the staff. Interested to see Timothy Bessolo’s response, as well — I hope he has one, and that the DT reports it. It’s a shame that a university that has often been lauded for its LGBT inclusion has such paltry resources to offer them. Keep following up on this, please!
Hi, can you clarify –> are you saying you know for a fact that Student Affairs doesn’t need the extra space? Your comment almost sounds like you’re saying the LGBT resource center doesn’t need extra space, but I hope/think we can both agree that it does. Also, not sure if you picked up on this part but the story does cite a student who uses the resource, Alyssa Coffrey. Not only is Alyssa a student, but as executive director of QUASA, she has been elected by her constituents (other LGBTQ+ students and allies) to program for and serve that community. I also think it’s possible that not as many LGBTQ+ students use the resource precisely because it is so small and limited spatially, but that’s just my speculation.
Hi Sophia,
My comment referred to the following quote:
“But at the end of the last school year, Associate Vice Provost for Student Affairs, Division Initiatives and Operations Timothy Bessolo was involved in the decision over how to repurpose the space, and it was decided that it would be turned into an Innovation Lab and a space for Student Affairs staff.”
To clarify: I absolutely think the LGBT center needs the space. I don’t think it should’ve been usurped for “an Innovation lab and a space for Student Affairs staff,” hence my dig at Student Affairs. Thanks for pointing out the student mentioned, though, I did miss that (though I would like to see more interviewed — I don’t think one student is enough). Either way, I do very much hope the DT follows up on this story, as I think it’s an important one.
I’m very confused and hope one of you can help clarify this for me. Before Vinent left (the former director), he authored a resolution with USC to ensure a meeting space for LGBT students. When Kelby arrived, administrators gave them a huge conference room just a few feet down their current office in Student Union. So they technically have 2 large rooms in Student Union, more than any other group in Student Union. So now they want more space? I’m just a little confused. I’ve been in the offices multiple times and, most of the time, it is empty except for the IT guy. Also, as this article correctly mentions, the center does most of their activities in URC because those facilities are HUGE and any student group can use them for free. Also, the location of LGBT center is really ideal because it’s located next to the other cultural offices of the Black student union, El Centro, etc. 
Real talk though, honestly, the school is having a very hard time with finding space for everything right now. If you’re an upperclassmen science student, you can remember where the old chemistry labs were in the dungeon. Many people don’t know this, but the academic and deans offices for USC Dornsife are actually located in Downtown Los Angeles because the main campus doesn’t have enough room for those offices.
The “huge” room you mentioned was allowed to be used by the Resource Center (with the leftover office furniture the old tenant didn’t want) for less than a semester before being taken away for a different purpose. The remodeling project was canned by Student Affairs. The only room they have now is space that barely accommodates one couch for students. URC does have space available in the evenings, but is on the other side of campus and has no equipment other than a few tables and a lot of mismatched chairs.

A recent poll conducted by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the Los Angeles Times and SurveyMonkey found that California voters are more likely than the rest of the nation to see immigrants as beneficial to society.
The poll — which took place from Oct. 29 to Nov. 3 and asked more than 5,000 people about their thoughts on immigration, government and the economy — took into account voters’ political affiliations and demographics and tested samples from California and the nation at large.
According to USC News, the poll found that 59 percent of California voters believe that immigrants strengthen society and 35 percent believe that they weaken it. In comparison, only 49 percent of U.S. voters believe that immigration is beneficial while 43 percent believe it is detrimental.
However, the poll also found that 41 percent of California voters believe that immigrants cause financial difficulties, while 10 percent say that they make things easier financially and 39 percent say that they make no difference. These results, according to Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Director Dan Schnur, demonstrate that Californians recognize the short-term challenges of immigration as well as the long-term benefits.
“It’s not surprising that Californians are much more positive about the benefits of immigration than voters nationally, but even our state’s residents recognize that immigration can present economic challenges as well,” Schnur told USC News.
The results of the poll showed a clear division among party lines, with the majority of Democrats harboring positive feelings about immigration and cultural diversity and the majority of Republicans coming out against it. Furthermore, demographics play a role as well; a majority of younger and minority voters in California supported immigration.
The poll also tested voters’ opinions on economic inequality, with 59 percent of California voters stating that an economic system that favors the wealthy is a significant issue and only 39 percent citing government regulation of the free market as a bigger problem.
ILLEGAL Immigrants are a detriment but people who want to work hard and build a life for their families should always be welcome.  There will be moochers in any group!
Immigrants and minorities are now a major force in America. They and the children they
bear account for 60 percent of our nation’s population growth, own 11 percent
of US businesses, and are 60 percent more likely to start a new business than
native-born Americans. In fact, forty percent of Fortune 500 companies were
started by an immigrant or a child of an immigrant, creating 10 million jobs
and seven out of ten top brands in our country. 
   More importantly, the vast majority of these
human beings—both legal and undocumented—come to improve their lives and create
a foundation of success for their children to build upon, bringing skills and a
willingness to work hard to make their dreams a reality, something our founders
did four hundred years ago. 
   However, most struggle in their efforts and need guidance in Anytown, USA.
Perhaps intelligent immigration reform, White House/Congress and business/labor
cooperation, concerned citizens and informative books can extend a helping hand,
the same unwavering hand, lest we forget, that has been the anchor and lighthouse of American values for four
hundred years.
   A new award-winning worldwide book/ebook
that can help immigrants and minorities and is endorsed by ambassadors,
educators, and editors: “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A
To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business,
Language and More.” 
   Here’s a closing quote from the book’s
Intro: “With all of our cultural differences though, you’ll be surprised to
learn how much…we as human beings have in common on this little third rock from
the sun. After all, the song played at our Disneyland parks around the world is
‘It’s A Small World After All.’ Peace.”
Regardless of this type POLL – it is very clear ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION is NOT GOOD for any STATE in USA or its territories!  DRUG ADDICTS & ILLEGALS are NOT GOOD items.
Are we talking LEGAL or ILLEGAL immigration? If done appropriately, immigration is good. We can build on talents from all around the world. Illegal immigration is a totally different issue and is the only true problem with immigration. Illegal immigrants  are cheaters and violate the law for their own selfish reasons. They are a slap in the face to the legal immigrants that have jumped through all the hoops and legal processes required to enter this nation legally. They try to demand the rights of legal residents, sometimes even more than legal residents. 
Sounds like a bias poll

As colleges across the country, under increasing federal and public pressure, have begun to increase enforcement for sexual assault policy, some have questioned whether federal intervention is a net positive, given the red tape, strict requirements and harsh punishments it entails. But using federal investigations as a reason to pump the brakes on sexual assault — an issue which for so long has been ignored — dissolves accountability for universities, halting progress as a whole.
Unlike virtually every other issue, sexual assault prevention and enforcement policies receive almost universal bipartisan support federally. But curiously, while legislators don’t want to be seen as soft on sexual assault, some have introduced bills — named the Safe Campus Act and Fair Campus Act in a cruel twist of irony — that prohibit investigation of sexual assault cases until reported to police, introducing more barriers to enact justice for sexual assault survivors. So, while they still can, survivor advocates must seize the political momentum to create institutional objectives to eliminate sexual assault.
Without federal government intervention, universities go virtually unchecked by outside entities. It’s not that individual universities are inherently untrustworthy, but rather that their incentives require a closer evaluation of whether they will properly enforce sexual assault policies. Since full enforcement requires both financial and administrative resources and increases the chances of lawsuits — one which an expelled student accused of sexual assault has already won against USC — universities are disincentivized to crack down on sexual assault. Moreover, since comprehensive sexual assault reform requires having a frank discussion with students about the meaning of consent and the role of greek life, beginning the process of actually eliminating a sexually hostile environment brings negative publicity to potential applicants to universities by highlighting the sexual assault problem in the first place.
And considering that 55 universities — including USC — are under federal Title IX investigation for potentially mishandling sexual violence and harassment complaints as of May 2014, it’s safe to say that empirically, universities are not adequately addressing the issue of sexual assault on their own.
There are, admittedly, some faults within the scope of federal investigations. The civil rights office should provide technical assistance to colleges that request it and should more comprehensively examine individual sexual assault cases to prevent mislabeling — since current investigations are broad, not deep, in scope. But to peel back the power of federal investigations because of these flaws would do a deep disservice to the thousands of college students looking to take agency of their lives after experiencing assault.
At USC, the issue of sexual assault is its own beast. University officials are dealing with fallout from its Title IX investigation and getting flak from students for allowing the Greek system to foster a climate rife with sexual assault. The recently proposed diversity resolution includes adding another Title IX investigator, and students want more resources for the Center for Women and Men. But while it’s facing pressure to adopt more stringent policies when dealing with sexual assault, it’s also being ordered to reinstate a student expelled for sexual misconduct, and the threat of more costly lawsuits constantly looms in the future, as well as greater concerns for due process for the accused. So it’s almost as if the University can’t win.
The University is in a dilemma that colleges across the country find themselves in, stuck between competing incentives that seem to doom the administration regardless of the path taken. But now is the time that the University must put its students before itself and recommit to creating tangible changes to eliminate the predatory climate that has proven to pervade the University — which means making tough and controversial decisions to change the power dynamics of greek life which currently tip in favor of fraternities, expanding resources for survivors, streamlining the reporting and investigation process and increasing transparency for students. In doing so, the University could spin the story of a university grossly mishandling the grave issue of sexual assault to an institutional pioneer of sexual assault prevention.

What on earth are you advocating here? Your conclusion is incomprehensible. How about advocating for fairness for all students, instead of just making conclusory assertions that the process favors fraternities.

One in five women will experience sexual assault at some point in her college career, most during their freshman or sophomore years. And as sexual assault becomes one of the most rapidly growing crimes in America and universities repeatedly show ambivalence toward rape victims, the national government has become involved. However, given the lack of progress seen in federal investigations, there should be a re-examination of how to deal with the sexual assault epidemic.
In recent years, the federal government has tightened the reins on how to deal with campus sexual assault, launching extensive investigations. The Office for Civil Rights has been quick to condemn the universities that only three years ago were praised for creating “a culture that is safe to students.” On top of that, Not Alone, a governmental task force, aims to incite action in bystanders. On the surface, it might seem like the government is obliterating rape culture, but the reality is far from it.
Currently, the responsibilities between campus and federal dealings of sexual assault are messily delineated. Sexual assault prevention typically falls under the duties of a college administration, but other sensitive topics, such as reporting, police involvement and media publicity, are no man’s land. Additionally, the requirements of how to clearly state sexual assault violations campus policies vary from school to school.
Due to these muddled processes at institutions throughout the nation, many victims have spoken out about how their schools have rejected or mishandled cases based on Title IX guidelines. Moreover, the federally enforced process mandates that campuses use a lowered evidentiary standard during their rape trials, in which the student judiciary government would use a “more likely than not” instead of the “beyond a reasonable doubt” margin to indict the accused. This has caused instances in which the accused have maintained their innocence. Either way, the actual rapists are getting away unscathed without due punishment.
Coupled with the fact that a small fraction — only 5 percent — of victims come forward and report rape, the government should fracture their responsibilities among campuses. This way, college administrations can take a more directive, victim-first approach in championing the issue. For the government, campus sexual assault is just another agenda that must be completed; for the university, it’s an issue that plagues the student body.
The government should outline unambiguous responsibilities for the university and allow them to take over in supervised investigations of sexual assault cases. Ultimately, these measures make up for the gaps currently in place.
It’s impossible not to recognize the pervasive problem campus sexual assault presents. Though the government has attempted to handle this job, many cases get swept under the rug or the wrong people have been accused. Thus, if colleges were afforded more authority in this arena, it would give the victims an opportunity to feel supported. One in five is just too many.

Take aim · Daniel Craig returns as James Bond in Spectre, the latest in the popular film series. In this movie, Bond goes after the villain, played by actor Christoph Waltz, in a mission for a friend. – Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures
Some movies, no matter how formulaic they are, will never get old. Bond films are evidence of this, as proven by the franchise’s longstanding history and success in film. Some of the Bond films completely reinvent the standard of being incredible espionage thrillers, while others are less memorable but still enjoyable entries in the series. Spectre is a decent Bond movie, but is ultimately forgettable.
James Bond (Daniel Craig) is back for a personal mission while investigating something for an old friend of his. The more he investigates, however, the deeper he gets pulled into a world of shadows and danger, and those who are close to him are also roped into his world of impending doom. Bond has to find a way to stay alive yet again in the midst of non-stop action.
One of the overlooked things about this movie is its great pacing. The movie runs for two hours and 28 minutes, but it rarely feels like it’s dragging along. There is plenty of action to go around, and many of the set pieces are grandiose in nature. The dialogue comes just as fast as the action, but it’s not too difficult to follow. Some of the older Bond movies are very dialogue heavy — what is actually five minutes can feel a lot longer. This movie does a good job of keeping the action going for the entirety of the movie, and while there are some dialogue-heavy scenes, the conversations are relatively easy to follow.
This is also a downside, as there aren’t a lot of quotable or memorable lines or conversations in the movie. In fact, the only memorable ones usually come across as corny or out of character. There are some lines from Bond that feel out of character for the cold, brutal and calculating Bond that Craig is known for. They provide a couple of quick laughs to diffuse the tension but feel gimmicky and do not seem characteristic of Bond films in the long run.
For the most part, Craig does a fantastic job as Bond. Though in some of the scenes he might be pandering to the audience for a cheap laugh, there are other times when Craig delivers a line with just the right amount of sarcasm. This is reminiscent of Sean Connery’s portrayal of James Bond. Connery always had the right thing to say for every situation. This gives Craig’s portrayal of Bond a relatable aspect, as no one wants to see an emotionless and monolithic Bond. That being said, Craig’s Bond still brings the ruthlessness that many have fallen in love with, and his portrayal in this film doesn’t detract from the argument as to why some say he’s the best Bond to date.
Though Craig’s performance is strong, it isn’t enough to pick up the slack of the unfortunate lack of character development from nearly every character in the film. This film, like Skyfall, has a premise that is very personal to Bond, but the film hardly scratches the surface in terms of development of Bond. Léa Seydoux, who plays Dr. Madeleine Swann and the iconic “Bond girl” in the film, appears to be just along for the ride. In contrast to a lot of the other characters in the film, her development seems forced and way too fast. Seydoux’s character expansion will definitely leave some confused, as she seems like a completely different character by the end of the film—but not in a good way.
On the other hand, the new villain, played by Christoph Waltz, feels tragically underused. As seen in Skyfall, a great villain can make a Bond movie soar to a new level of greatness, but the antagonist in Spectre feels like he’s there solely to fulfill the requirement of the bad guy. There just simply isn’t enough character development for the villain, and it is by far the most disappointing aspect to the movie.
Spectre is a commendable Bond film that features plenty of action and Bond tropes that will satisfy any fan of the series. However, those who are looking for something spectacular and groundbreaking will be left with a feeling of dissatisfaction with this entry, as the poor character development and less-than-memorable dialogue make this film and a disappointing phantom of what it could have been.

Situated in the heart of one of the most influential music cities in the world, USC has resources that link both students and faculty to the music industry. I have been able to take a plethora of classes here at USC through the Thorton School of Music that have not only encouraged and helped my understanding of musical knowledge, but have also opened my eyes even more to the world of EDM that I love so much.
In 2013, USC began a controversial and interesting feats of musical education. It began the first Electronic Dance Music class here on campus, which has since became extremely popular. Taught by professor Sean Nye, it is the first in a line of controversial and innovative classes.
Though Electronic Dance Music has been around for much longer than most people imagine, I only came to understand and be passionate about it maybe seven years ago. Even then, this genre presented itself as an incredibly taboo one.
Known only for its relation to drugs, sex and alcohol, EDM was viewed as corrupt and hedonistic and was restricted to the underground warehouse raves. So, whenever I’ve ever told anyone that I was taking this history of EDM class here, the immediate response is, “Well, how can they have a class about a genre that’s only been around for a few years?”
At first I used to ask the same question. I was in love with EDM. I loved the way it broke borders between societal stigmas. Most of all, I loved the way it fit directly as the voice of our generation, specifically with its place in the future of the music industry. However, I never really knew where EDM started.
If you had asked me a couple of years ago where I thought EDM originated, I would have scoffed and said, “Maybe in some Euro trash hostel in Amsterdam or Stockholm.” I pictured frosted tips in bug-eye glasses with kandi all up their arms dancing in weird robotic motions. Though this stereotype has an entertaining kernel of truth, as evidenced by the attire at any EDM festival, it is only a singular narrative of the history of EDM.
What USC and its class on EDM have done is change this stigmatized narrative about EDM and its technical origins. Just as gangster rap, reggae and some other genres were easily dismissed and associated largely with small cultural minorities, EDM has largely been dismissed as a drug crazed mess of teenage angst and sexual frustration.
What changing this narrative, through education and conversation, has done is open our eyes to the historical and cultural importance of Electronic Dance Music. For example, EDM has had significant influence in the black and gay rights movements, as house music started in black, gay and Latino underground clubs in America. EDM has also had significant historical context in European post-war understandings of society.
Probably most importantly, EDM has such an important musical implication in the current and future music industry, a fact that interests me, as a music major, the most. As a product of the new age of technology, EDM has the implication that it exceeds the singular abilities of traditional human-run instruments. The use of technology and never-before seen sonic production means that EDM can survive forever. It has an unbelievable capacity for evolution and adaptation. Within the industry, this genre surpasses any others before it in its infinite future possibilities.
We constantly go on and on about breaking down stigmas in society. But the issues we face can’t be stopped by online surveys and bogus half-formed ideas to “change the world.” Music, art and other cultural practices have time and time again shown to be vehicles for social change. We have been educated about pop, rock and soul and their cultural and historical contexts, but we’ve never come to recognize the significance to our social evolution that EDM has produced. By educating ourselves about the history of EDM, whether by taking this great class at USC or through self-education, we can begin to understand a more expansive context of our current culture.
For music students, it’s even more important to recognize and be educated about this aspect of music because it really is a driving force within the industry, not only now but also in the future. I’m sure there are many people of an older generation that would disagree with my zeal and condemn my passion for this genre, but as we’ve seen with many other realms, when we experience and study history, we can learn so much about our future. This applies to EDM as it continues to hit the radios, festivals and our everyday industries and cultures.

Registering for classes when you are undeclared can be confusing. Make sure to talk to your academic advisor for advice. Emily Goldberg | Daily Trojan
So you’re still figuring out what you want to do with your studies during your time in college. Being undeclared myself, I didn’t have a clear direction of what I wanted to study when I first enrolled at USC. This was especially problematic because I didn’t know which courses would benefit me when I first registered for classes. For all the undeclared majors out there, this article will offer helpful tips on the types of courses to select if you are unsure about what type of career want to pursue.
1. Fulfill university requirements
As an undeclared major, the easiest way to choose your classes is to take a couple General Education courses or a Writing one. By doing so, you’ll be able to get your required courses out of the way early on. This will also allow you to have enough time to take classes that will eventually count toward your declared major.
2. Take classes that interest you
College is the perfect time to explore what subjects you’re truly passionate about, especially if you have never learned about the subject before. Try taking at least one course that sparks your interest but you know nothing about. Often times, colleges offer classes that you won’t be able to find anywhere else. A new topic may also influence which major you ultimately declare. 
3. Talk to your academic advisor
In retrospect, one regret that I have was not communicating with my academic advisor enough freshman year. Academic advisors are a really helpful resource when you are uncertain about which courses are appropriate for you. In addition, they can also recommend courses for you to take if you simply don’t have any idea about what you want to learn about. If you ever feel uncomfortable with your registered classes, set up an appointment with your academic advisor to discuss your situation. They’re only one phone call away.
4. Be open-minded
One of the biggest misconceptions about college is that you must stick to a set plan for the next four years of your life. A majority of students end up switching majors, or even applying to other professional schools at some point during their college career — and that’s OK! By taking a diverse range of courses, it will help you discover what you really enjoy, and it gives you other options in case your original plan doesn’t work out.
Being undeclared can be the most confusing and stressful time as a college student, but you still have a lot of time to decide your career path. However, these tips will be helpful in deciding which courses to take in the upcoming semester and will hopefully relieve some of that stress.

In true American fashion, blogger Charlie Wulff put “sweat, blood and precious midterm study time” into her Halloween costume this year. Charlie Wulff | Daily Trojan
Halloween in the Netherlands is an excuse for teenagers and college students to dress up as slutty anythings or wear cat ears while consuming copious amounts of alcohol. Halloween in Los Angeles is an excuse for teenagers and college students to dress up as slutty anythings or wear cat ears whilst consuming copious amounts of alcohol, but it is also so much more than that.
And so, without further ado, I present to you the foreign student’s guide to having an unforgettable Halloween — though you might forget some parts, who am I to judge.                    
First, make sure to take your costume very seriously. Many people here put their sweat, blood and precious midterm study time into creating unique and inventive masterpieces to be worn only once. The scary costumes are legitimately scary and the funny costumes make me laugh out loud (do yourself a favor and google “hoverboard Aladdin”) — even the slutty anythings look convincing as hell. Group costumes are definitely a thing for both friend groups and families. If that is not enough, plenty of people have at least two costumes ready because everyone knows that wearing the same costume to different parties is social suicide.
Next, map out a strategic party route that minimizes the chances of being shut down early and left in the streets trying to assemble your drunk group of friends in search of another party. My roommates didn’t listen to me and went to the Row. Who had a terrible night? They did. Who had a great night? Me!
Third, if you are hosting a party, make sure there is candy. For American college students, Halloween is more than just getting drunk. Chances are, their parents dressed them up in adorable costumes when they were little and took them trick or treating. Now if there is anything Jimmy Kimmel has taught me, American kids are serious about their Halloween candy — and I definitely would not want to let that tradition go as I became older. Though, I have to say, I do not understand this obsession with candy corn. Seriously, why be satisfied with those weird little waxy cones that taste like nothing but sugar and butter when things like sour straws exist? Or those foamy jelly type things that look like real eyeballs? Ah, Americans.
I have been laughing so much at all the media paranoia about Halloween. My favorite story this year was that some parents were concerned that shady neighbors would give their kids ecstasy pills that look like candy. To me that seems highly unlikely, not just because that is evil and pointless but also because giving perfectly good drugs to children seems pretty damn wasteful (just kidding, mum and dad).
Finally, plan ahead to the next morning when you have to cure your hangover. I recommend Roscoe’s fried chicken and waffles with a side of aspirin.
This Halloween, I spent an entire day making a matching, wacky, waving, inflatable arm-flailing man costumes from laundry hampers with my friend and then spent all night feeling kind of ridiculous and wildly unattractive but also happy with the attention I was getting from intoxicated strangers. In fact, I was probably more popular than if I had just conformed to the gender norm and dressed as a slutty anything. I was definitely more popular than my normally dressed self.
That’s kind of depressing.
Almost as depressing as my shattered phone screen, which I don’t remember dropping.

The Trojans overcame a 14-point deficit thanks to big games from sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and freshman running back Ronald Jones II, and defeated the Arizona Wildcats 38-30 at the Coliseum on Saturday night.
The win gave the Trojans (6-3, 4-2 Pac-12) their third consecutive victory and keeps them in contention in the Pac-12 South. 
Jones had 177 yards on 19 carries, breaking a USC record for most yards in a game by a freshman.
Smith-Schuster, who underwent surgery on a broken hand Monday, not only started the game, but was also explosive, finishing with 138 receiving yards on 8 catches, which included a 72-yard touchdown.
“Not the prettiest of victories, but I love how this team is,” interim head coach Clay Helton said. “Every time they’re faced with adversity, they just rise up.”
After falling behind 14-0 in the first half, the Trojans came from behind to take their first lead of the game on the first play of the fourth quarter on a nine-yard touchdown run by junior running back Justin Davis to put USC ahead 24-20. The play was set up by a pivotal third-down run by Jones, who bursted up the middle for 27 yards to the Wildcats’ (5-5, 2-5) nine-yard line. It was the first time USC erased a 14-point deficit since 2012 against Utah.
Five minutes later, after a field goal by the Wildcats, Jones helped the Trojans create some separation with a career long 74-yard touchdown run, bouncing off several defenders as he maneuvered his way into the end zone.
“It was just a run to the right,” Jones said. “It was the offensive line creating holes for me. I should have stayed outside but I got excited. Steven [Mitchell Jr.] helped me out and it was off to the races.”
Ahead 31-23, the Trojans forced a punt and marched right back down the field, taking more than five minutes off the clock and capping the drive off with a 16-yard touchdown run by Davis for the exclamation mark on the victory.
It took until the second quarter for the Trojans to wake up. Down 14-3 and with the Wildcats threatening to score again, sophomore safety John Platteburg came up with a pivotal interception. And on USC’s first play of the ensuing drive, Cody Kessler found a streaking Smith-Schuster downfield for a 72-yard touchdown to cut the lead to four.
“Somebody had to make a big play,” Smith-Schuster said. “When coach called the play, I said, ‘Ok the corner’s playing low, the safety’s playing low. It’s a touchdown.’ In my mind, I said, ‘Just catch the ball and run, and that’s what happened.’”
Helton explained the aggressive play calling as one of the team’s hallmarks.
“We’re always going to stay aggressive,” he said. “It doesn’t matter where we are. Whether it’s defensive blitzing or throwing the ball deep, we trust our players to make plays. We’re always going to stay aggressive with that mindset. We’re going to stay fearless.”
A failed onside-kick attempt led to an Arizona field goal, but the Trojans managed to tie the game before halftime. Relying heavily on the run on this drive with Jones receiving the bulk of the carries, it fittingly ended with a five-yard touchdown catch-and-run by Jones on a screen pass to even the score at 17-17 going into the break. 
Arizona scored the lone points of the third quarter, settling for a field goal after failing to convert in the red zone. The Trojans responded with a drive that lasted nearly five minutes, but they too stalled in the red zone and Alex Wood missed a 34-yard field goal wide right.
It was an inauspicious start for the Trojans, who managed just 12 yards of offense and two first downs in the first quarter. They went three-and-out on three of their four drives and fumbled on the other.
“We started slow,” Helton said. “The penalties and turnover were momentum killers. I was proud of the boys. They didn’t show any signs of panic. They came back in the second quarter and put 17 points on the board. Our defense kept us in the game while we got our stuff straight.
Meanwhile, the Wildcats took advantage of the Trojans’ early struggles. Arizona recovered a fumble on a botched handoff from Kessler to Madden and the Wildcats converted on the drive with a touchdown pass from Anu Solomon to Nate Phillips on a play action play.
Arizona took a two-touchdown lead set up by a seven play, 60-yard drive at the end of the first quarter, capped off by a three-yard touchdown catch by David Richards to give the Wildcats a 14-0 lead.
The Trojans’ first points came on their first drive of the second quarter. After they failed to convert in the red zone, Wood connected on a 24-yard field goal to put USC on the board.
For a Wildcats team that focused heavily on the run, the Trojans were exemplary defending the ground game, limiting Arizona to just 60 yards on 23 carries.
“We knew going into the game it was going to be a dogfight,” redshirt defensive tackle Antwaun Woods said. “We took it upon ourselves to be disciplined for four quarters, to be able to defend the run over and over and over again. We knew they were going to keep coming back to the run game. We just played disciplined football.”
And they played winning football, on the backs of a freshman running back and an injured star wide receiver, who was determined to play and make an impact.
“My whole mindset was to come back and play in this game,” Smith-Schuster said. “I was in a lot of pain. I cried the first night because it was so much pain. The only thing I was thinking about was my brothers are out there working hard every day at practice and I’m doing nothing, just getting treatment. I knew when it was time to play, I really didn’t care about the pain.”
Helton was in awe of Smith-Schuster’s fortitude.
“I’ve never in my life been associated with more of a warrior than No. 9,” Helton said. “For him to do what he did and absolutely commit himself to this team blows me away.”
Kessler threw for 243 yards and two touchdowns on 22-of-36 passing, while Solomon had 352 yards passing and three touchdowns. 
USC will head on the road next week to take on Colorado in a Friday night affair.
