Latino/a Social Work Caucus, USC Latino Graduate Student Association and El Centro Chicano jointly hosted a traditional Latino Dia de los Muertos ceremony that involved a discussion of gang violence on Thursday morning.
At 10:50 a.m. Thursday morning, 10 performers in traditional Mexican garb and carrying traditional Mexican instruments arrived at Tommy Trojan. As a crowd gathered, the performers began a ceremonial cleansing with smoke, as they started to dance, play drums and blow into a conch shell.
After a few songs, the performers and audience proceeded to El Centro located in the Student Union, where the dialogue on gang violence began.
Dia de los Muertos is a Mexican holiday celebrated from Oct. 31 to Nov. 2 that honors family members who have passed away. The Dia de los Muertos altar at the front of the El Centro stage  was a sobering reminder of the dangers of gang violence.
Though this is an annual event for El Centro, Thursday marked the first time it was not held in the United University Church because of the recent administrative decision to move El Centro to the Student Union. William Vela, director of El Centro, said the change forced minor adjustments to the program to accommodate the smaller space of the new location.
Chicano activists Alex Aldana, William “Blinky” Rodriguez and Joseph Sanchez all spoke at the event.
Aldana opened the discussion with a testimony on his upbringing in gang violence.
“For me it all started in October of 1988. There was a series of shootings in my community. I was a firsthand witness. The first happened across the street from where I lived. All because of a gang war between Santa Monica and Culver City,” Aldana said. “I was only 13 years old at the time, but I had to do something about it.”
Aldana’s nonprofit, the Pico Youth and Family Center, specializes in hosting youth events in order to instill cultural history in the Latino community. He believes that the answer to issues of violence is the arts. He argued that the ban on ethnic studies in Arizona has led to increased gang violence.
“Don’t teach them about Columbus, teach them about the cultura. We don’t know our history,” Aldana said.
Rodriguez spoke next. His involvement in the fight against gang violence began on February of 1990, when he received a call from the hospital.
“‘Mr. and Mrs. Rodriguez, we have a body in room two with no identification.’ That’s where I see my son’s feet hanging out from under a white sheet, and I know my son’s feet,” he said.
Since his son’s death, Rodriguez has been passionate about solving the issue of gang violence. He said he believes that the problem doesn’t come from the system, but from “the homies.”
“There are good ‘homies,’ and there are bad ‘homies,’” Rodriguez said, adding that he hopes that through sports outings designed to unite rival gangs, the “bad homies” will become “good homies.”
The third speaker, Sanchez, said he believes the issue of gang violence stems from broken home life.
“We don’t have a youth problem. We have an adult problem,” Sanchez said.
He showed a picture of a boy he has worked with and explained that kids give him his purpose.
“This generation is key for executing this change,” Sanchez said.
Rodriguez echoed the need for the next generation to join the effort to eliminate violence.
“We need your heart and your mind. If it’s just an intellectual premise, you’re gonna run out of gas,” he said.
Despite the seriousness of this issue, the event ended on an optimistic note. Rodriguez will continue to host inter-gang rallies, Sanchez’s juvenile hall program will be funded by Katy Perry this year and Aldana has forged an alliance with Santa Monica College’s film program.
Students echoed the optimism of the speakers.
“I think that humanity should help each other more,” said Juan Cruz, a first-year master’s student studying social work. “I don’t care if you’re Latino, black, white, whatever skin color you are. We should be helping each other out.”
Vela said that part of the motive behind the caucus was to connect students with each other.
“Our main goal is to support them in their progress and in their growth at USC, ultimately to graduate,” Vela said of the event’s mission. “This event is important to the Centro because of the cultural significance, but also for the undergraduates to become more connected to the graduate students.”

Students in USC’s Norman Topping Student Aid Fund teamed up with the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks Thursday afternoon to educated children about Halloween safety.

Held at the Hoover Recreation Center, “Safe Halloween,” catered to local children under the age of 12, who enjoyed a haunted house, various games, a costume contest and plenty of candy at the event.
“This is actually the 15th year we have coordinated this event. We basically get together with the Hoover Recreation Center, and we plan all components that go towards Safe Halloween,” said Jeymi Choi, office manager of the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund office. “We wanted to be able to provide a safe environment for all the kids in the community. In order to do so, we set this up so they don’t have to go into the community, but can come here and enjoy everything for free.”
The Topping Scholars program sponsors primarily students from the University Park community.
“The program got started 40 years ago and was originally just for kids from the local community. Now students all over the country can apply; however, students from the local community do get special consideration in the selection process,” said Felipe Martinez, assistant director of the Topping Scholars program.
One local Topping scholar, John Mendoza, a sophomore majoring in applied and computational mathematics, was particularly passionate about the event.
“I’m originally from the local community so I definitely have the perspective as someone who, when I was little, wanted to go trick-or-treating and have fun with my family, but was limited by the safety issue,” Mendoza said. “A lot of families didn’t have the money to take their kids to other Halloween places such as Six Flags.”
The Topping Scholars were split into teams to make the event run efficiently.
“There are different booths that all the scholars can work at. We can scare kids in the haunted house, work at the creative stations building ghosts and pumpkins or watch over the kids who play in the jumpy houses,” said Erik Estrada, a freshman majoring in public relations. “It’s really well-organized in the sense that there are stations and everyone has a task at hand to do.”
Though the administrators and Topping Scholars worked on the event together, the two groups had different goals for the day. The majority of the students wanted to spend time with the children and their fellow scholars.
“I’m hoping to see some great costumes, and also interact with some of the kids” said Kaijona Wade, a freshman majoring in business administration.
Estrada agreed with Wade.
“Basically seeing the smile on the faces of some of these outreach kids who can’t really go out into their own neighborhoods, something most of us take for granted, is definitely a warm feeling that I won’t forget,” Estrada said.
The sense of community was ever-present at the event. Administrators of the program were heavily focused on the long-term benefits of the event.
“We hope that the local community will learn about college and our scholarship by coming to this event. Hopefully, they will connect this fun experience with going to college,” Choi said.
Martinez echoed the words of Choi.
“The purpose of the program is for them to interact with current USC students, but also do something fun for Halloween,” he said. “In the past, the USC students have had a really good time because they get to interact with kids. It’s really interesting to see previous scholars return with their kids and family members.”
Many scholars said they were affected by the experience.
“As a native of South Los Angeles, it’s really touching to be on the other side and give back to a community I grew up in,” Mendoza said.

USC students have taken to the Internet to express their concern that USC professor Cecilia Woloch, a non-tenure-track English professor, is not being fairly compensated.
Utilizing Change.org, Kimmery Galindo, a former student of Woloch’s, began a petition with the intent to protest budget cutbacks to programs Woloch created. According to the petition, USC deans are pushing Woloch to resign by requiring her to “teach larger course loads for substantially less pay than tenured colleagues.”
“I thought at least if she could have support from lots of other people, she wouldn’t feel so alone in the process,” Galindo said.
Since it was created earlier this month, the petition has garnered more than 540 signatures of support from past and present students, community members and supporters not affiliated with USC.
Woloch has taught at USC for the last seven years. She is an established author of five published poetry collections, a recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship and has 20 years of experience outside the classroom — including working in a prison with the mentally ill. She has also created two programs within the English Department: “The Poet in Paris” and “The Writer in the Community.”
“That the administration has used those programs to try to recruit ‘transformative’ faculty — at five times my salary — while refusing to even mention my name in association with those programs, makes it clear to me that I’ll never be recognized or rewarded for my contributions,” Woloch wrote in a letter to USC officials.
Tenured professors are described by the university’s faculty handbook as those who are indispensable to the success of an institution in fulfilling its obligations to its students and society.
These positions are granted based on the significance and influence of a faculty member’s research, future contributions to academia and awards the faculty member has received. Woloch said she believes she has succeeded in doing these things, but a lack of university support has made her reconsider her value.
A professor’s tenure, or lack thereof, does not contribute to funding of their programs. Decisions of funding are made on a case-by-case basis depending on the school, program and ability to apply for grant funding.
“An academic decision about what programs will receive funding are not made on the basis of if it’s a tenured or not tenured person who is directing the program,” said Beth Meyerowitz, vice provost for faculty affairs.
Woloch created the Poet in Paris course within the Maymester program in the hopes of exposing students to French poetry and culture. The four-unit class takes students to Paris for one month over the summer.
The program has been cut from a $6,000 stipend to a $1,500 stipend, for what Woloch was told in an official memo, was “in the interest of equity.”
Chair of the English Department Margaret Russett recognized that Woloch’s position, if lost, would be difficult to fill, but said the choice goes beyond her department.
“It’s a faculty member’s choice about whether to stay or to go… If she feels she has better opportunities elsewhere then I would want her to do what she feels is best for her own career,” Russett said. “She’s a beloved teacher and I think it’s very appropriate for students to say that. With all that understood, the department cannot control her decision about her career.”
Some students, however, see the issue as representative of the bigger problem at USC.
“I think the tenure and non-tenure [title] is a larger issue that should be addressed. There is a crazy discrepancy between the two with resources,” said Betty Fang, a senior majoring in creative writing and business administration. “She’s doing things that, had she been tenured, she would’ve been promoted.”
Many of Woloch’s students are concerned that if she resigns a interesting learning opportunities and a valuable professor will be lost.
“I know at least in the creative writing community there will be a lot of discontent because Cecilia’s one of the best professors here,” said Jackson Burgess, a junior majoring in creative writing and narrative studies who Woloch mentors. “I would be willing to join in anything like a letter-writing campaign. When it comes down to it, I don’t know what there is to do against the bureaucracy that is USC administration.”
When asked if she would be officially resigning, Woloch said she is focused on the current semester.
“I am insisting that I keep my focus and my energies on the teaching I’m doing this semester and do the best job I can do,” she said. “Let me go out with a blaze.”
Editor’s note: The article has been updated to correct the names of the two programs Woloch created at USC. A previous version of the article incorrectly stated that Woloch created the Summer Poetry in Idyllwild and the Paris Poetry Workshop.

I’m concerned about a couple of errors in this article and would like to offer some clarification about the issues at stake.
I haven’t protested “cutbacks to programs” that I’ve created — although there were cuts to the budget for this past year’s Maymester program — but a substantial cut to my compensation for directing the program. Like all NTT faculty, I’m compensated at a much lower per-course salary than tenured faculty. And now that it’s become clear that most Maymester courses are being proposed, designed, directed and taught by NTT faculty, the administration has recently changed the rules: whereas, initially, a faculty member had the option of teaching a Maymester course as one of her/his regular spring semester courses OR as an overload course, now Maymester courses can ONLY be taught as “overload,” which is an even lower rate of compensation than regular NTT compensation In my case, I had been receiving a $6,000 stipend for directing the Paris program. This fall, Dean Lamy sent me a letter saying that the Paris program would be continued with the “condition” that my stipend for my work as director be cut from $6,000 to $1,500. The reason given for this was: “in the interests of equity.” Again, since Maymester programs have become mostly the province of NTT faculty — who need to find ways to increase their income from USC, since NTT are contractually forbidden to teach at other institutions, and regular NTT salaries at USC don’t offer a “living wage” for Los Angeles — USC administration seems to be looking for ways to further reduce NTT pay as a way to cut costs. 
In re the statement: ” She has also created two programs within the English Department: Summer Poetry in Idyllwild and the Paris Poetry Workshop.”
The two programs I’ve created for USC are “The Poet in Paris” and “The Writer in the Community.” The latter is a program that trains undergraduate creative writers to lead writing workshops in community settings; it also offers them the opportunity to gain hands-on experience leading workshops in local schools via JEP. Summer Poetry in Idyllwild was a conference I created in 1999, before coming to USC, and ran for ten years. It’s not, and has never been, a USC program.
In re the statement:
“A professor’s tenure, or lack thereof, does not contribute to funding of their programs. Decisions of funding are made on a case-by-case basis depending on the school, program and ability to apply for grant funding. 
Again, my conflict with the administration has been over the issue of my compensation, and not the funding or budget of the program itself, so I’m not sure how Vice Provost Meyerwitz’s statement applies. But it seems clear that, since Maymester programs are mostly — if not exclusively — being run by NTT faculty, who don’t have recourse or the rights of tenured faculty, the administration is taking advantage of the opportunity to cut costs while further reducing NTT compensation. Now it seems that the administration is willing to lose a hugely successful program — admissions uses “The Poet in Paris” as a recruiting tool, and it’s a program I created based on my years of experience and my personal network in Paris — for the sake of saving $4,500 — a miniscule amount to the university, but a substantial percentage of my compensation. The chair of the English department even approached Vice Dean Dani Byrd about the possibility of the English department finding a way to replace the $4,500 in order to keep me on staff to lead the Paris program this year. Vice Dean Byrd, as I understand it, gave Prof. Russett an “unequivocal NO.” 
As to “in the interest of equity,” see my comments above. Also, this begs the questions: 1) Are all tenured faculty compensated identically “in the interests of equity?” 2) Is there no such thing as merit where NTT faculty are concerned?
Thanks for your attention to this matter.

After almost a full semester in office, USG President Christian Kurth and Vice President Ryan Park feel as though they’ve accomplished a lot, but said there’s still a lot of work to be done.
Reflecting on the fall semester and their campaign platform, Kurth and Park said that one of USG’s biggest successes of 2013 has been the creation of the farmers market held every Wednesday in McCarthy Quad.
“Bringing a farmers market to campus was one of the bigger platform points we had,” Kurth said. “We were able to hammer out the details over summer break, so the first week of school we had it here ready to go. … That was really big for us momentum-wise.”
Many students were also excited by the development of the farmer’s market this year.
“It’s definitely more efficient and, in terms of USC’s image, [the farmer’s market] is a nice way to incorporate the community around USC on campus, especially considering the recent fences and security measures that have been put in place,” said Jackson Burgess, a junior majoring in creative writing and narrative studies.
Besides the farmers market, construction crews have also started repaving sidewalks on 28th Street, otherwise known as The Row. Kurth was excited that these projects are finally happening.
“These are big-capital projects that have been a couple of years in the making,” Kurth said. “For us to put the pieces together and get them done in the past few months is something we’re really proud of.”
In addition to larger developments, Kurth and Park have presided over smaller-scale improvements within USG itself. Park has worked to rebrand half of USG as the “executive cabinet,” which he believes gives the organization a renewed sense of identity and purpose.
“We want to make sure that everyone’s happy and getting their work done,” Park said. “That’s a lot of the job, managing day-to-day stuff.”
Other campaign promises, however, have been more challenging to deliver. Talks about extending hours at university libraries are ongoing. USC Guidebook, the “ultimate USC smartphone app” that Kurth and Park mentioned in their campaign platform, is still awaiting approval from Student Affairs.
“We can only do so much,” Kurth said. “We lay a lot of groundwork, but at the end of the day it’s the administration that gives us the [go ahead] on a lot of these things.”
Kurth cited former Vice President of Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson’s decision to step down, as well as the departure of Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Denzil Suite as the cause behind major communication challenges with the administration.
“These guys were the first point of contact for us in student government,” Kurth said. “It’s an interesting thing to deal with. We have all these new personnel, and we have to explain how things work and build relationships quickly so we can still be effective.”
As USG initiates dialogue with new administrators, Kurth and Park are looking forward. The two have long-term goals to improve USC recreation facilities and build a new library on campus, but they acknowledged these improvements will take time.
“I’d love to tear down the Lyon Center and build a [new recreation facility] in one term, but it’s not realistic,” Kurth said.
“It’s about picking and choosing your battles,” Park added.
Considering the difficulties of this transitional period, the USG leaders said they are proud of their work, and the work of all USG officials.
“It’s been great building a team [at USG],” Park said. “One of the most satisfying things is to see the people we’ve entrusted with responsibility, people our age and younger, getting involved. It’s awesome when they go out and do their job, and then do even more.
Students, however, had mixed opinions on Kurth and Park’s performance.
“I don’t think I’ve seen any substantial changes in the way the student body has been governed, to be quite honest,” said Michelle Khazaryan, a senior majoring in creative writing and international relations. “It’s been a trend throughout my time at USC.”

The USC women’s soccer team hopes to end a three-game losing streak in their final two home games of the 2013 season, as they prepare to take on Oregon on Friday at 3 p.m. and Oregon State on Sunday at 11 a.m. at McAlister Field.
Phenom · Freshman midfielder Kayla Mills has been a bright spot for USC this season, leading the team in assists (7) and points (13). – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
USC (6-9-2, 1-6-1 Pac-12) is coming off of a pair of weekend games against Colorado and Utah, a 2-1 loss to the Buffaloes and a 1-0 loss to the Utes.
Sophomore defender Marlee Carrillo scored the only goal of the weekend for the Women of Troy on an assist from junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley, just a week removed from scoring her first two goals of the season in a 3-2 overtime loss to Arizona at the Coliseum.
A week after USC overcame a 2-0 deficit in the last 10 minutes of regulation to send the game into overtime, the Women of Troy hoped to capture that same magic against the newest members of the Pac-12, but were unable to earn the equalizer in both games.
“It’s not like we’re not getting opportunities,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We’re getting balls saved off the line, we’re hitting the post, crossbar. I feel for these women. They don’t deserve the results that we’ve been getting with the way we’ve been playing.”
Even with the undesirable results that have unfolded this season, the players are still keeping their heads up. Though the team’s chances to make the NCAA tournament are slim to none, the Women of Troy steadfastly refuse to roll over as the season comes to a close.
“Of course it didn’t go as well as we wanted it to, but I don’t think it’s completely crushed our spirits,” sophomore forward Katie Johnson said about the team’s hard-luck campaign. “We’re a team that likes to win and we’re competitive, even at practice, so we’re going to bring it to every game and we’re still going to try to win.”
Khosroshahin has been inspired by the team’s “never-say-die” attitude.
“I have to give them a great deal of credit for not packing it in and [continuing to] keep fighting,” Khosroshahin said. “They are living our motto of ‘Fight On’ right now. They deserve better, they really do, and I’m hopeful that this weekend the ball starts finding the back of the net.”
Sunday’s contest, the last home game of the season for the Women of Troy, will mark the final home game for the five seniors on the team. Forward Elizabeth Eddy, midfielder Jordan Marada, defender Mia Bruno, midfielder Haley Boysen, and defender Autumn Altamirano will be honored during pre-game festivities.
“It’s kind of bittersweet,” sophomore forward Katie Johnson said. “I’m sure they’re excited to move on into their real-world jobs. It’s their life and it’s kind of sad and they’ve been our teammates. They’ve been great teammates, so I think we’re going to play for them. It’s a big part, because we know that eventually it’s going to be our Senior Day as well, so we want to just bring it for them too.”
Oregon (4-9-3, 2-5-1 Pac-12) is coming off a pair of home games against Stanford and California. The Ducks lost 2-1 to Stanford on Friday, but pulled off the upset against No. 12 California, winning 1-0 on Monday.
ShayLee Miner leads the team with three goals and seven points, while Bri Pugh has two goals and two assists for the Ducks.
Oregon State (5-10-2, 3-4-1 Pac-12) also took on California and Stanford at home. Like the Ducks, the Beavers earned a 1-0 win over the Golden Bears, but suffered a 4-1 loss at the hands of Stanford.
Jenna Richardson and Erin Uchacz lead the Beavers with 3 goals each, while Jacy Drobney and Natalie Meiggs lead with three assists each.
USC traveled to Oregon last season, suffering a 1-0 loss to Oregon and playing to a 1-1 tie against Oregon State. The Women of Troy are 13-3-1 against the Ducks all-time, but are 0-2-1 in the last three meetings, dating back to 2010.
USC has a 13-5-2 all-time record against the Beavers, but are 0-3-1 in the last four matches.
The Women of Troy will conclude their season in Westwood against No. 2 UCLA (14-1-2, 6-0-2 Pac-12) next Thursday at 5 p.m.

USC senior libero Natalie Hagglund was named a finalist for the 2013 Senior CLASS Award on Thursday.
The finalists for the award were selected from a group of 30 candidates by a media committee. Hagglund and Stanford middle blocker Carly Wopat are the two players representing the Pac-12 conference out of 10 total finalists.
The Senior CLASS award is given to the women’s volleyball athlete who exhibits strong play on the court, in addition to exceptional academic performance.
On the court, Hagglund has been an asset to the Women of Troy’s back line and currently serves as a team captain. Hagglund was also USC’s first-ever first-team All-American libero as a sophomore in 2011, and repeated for the honor in 2012.
The Women of Troy are coming off a close win against Stanford where they defeated the Cardinal in five sets (16-25, 25-23, 25-18, 22-25, 15-9). The game marked a personal milestone for Hagglund — the senior had a season-high 36 digs and passed former USC libero Debora Seilhamer (2,071 digs) to put her at the top of the USC women’s volleyball career list for digs with 2,095. The total ranks fifth in Pac-12 conference history, and Hagglund is sure to continue her climb up the conference record books in the Women of Troy’s remaining nine regular season games.
Off the court, the senior communications major has received Dean’s List honors, holds one of the highest GPA’s on the team, and was twice a Pac-12 All-Academic honorable mention. Hagglund also has a minor in occupational therapy.
Voting for the final award will be decided by media members, Division I head coaches, and a nationwide fan vote at SeniorCLASSAward.com. Fan voting will take place through Dec. 9.

The USC men’s water polo team (20-1) will be taking on the Pacific Tigers (15-3) in a critical matchup for both squads, as the Trojans enter the game with the No. 1 ranking while Pacific boasts the third spot in the national poll.
Leader · Senior driver Nikola Vavic leads the Trojans with 58 goals this season and broke the program record for career goals earlier this year. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
USC head coach Jovan Vavic’s squad is coming off of an impressive 16-10 victory over No. 6 UC Santa Barbara, another perennial water polo powerhouse. The win over the Gauchos propelled the Trojans back to the top spot in the national rankings. The team had previously held the No. 2 spot for four consecutive weeks following their loss against UCLA in the finals of the SoCal Tournament in early October.
Pacific enters this weekend’s matchup coming off of a heartbreaking 12-10 loss to No. 2 UCLA.
With a number of MPSF matches coming up, Vavic knows his team will have to bring their A-game if they’re going to remain undefeated in conference play.
“We have big conference games coming up,” Vavic said. “Everyone is going to play each other multiple times.”
Tigers goalie Alex Malkis has been dominant to this point, averaging 12.7 goals per game. He will have to come up big if Pacific is to snap USC’s 16-game winning streak against the Tigers and put a dent in the Trojans’ 43-7 all-time record against them.
The Trojans have yet to lose a road game this season, having won both of their matches in enemy territory (the one loss occurred in a neutral location), and will look to keep a zero in that loss column behind the strong play of senior standout driver Nikola Vavic.
Vavic recently took over as USC’s all-time scoring leader and has added to his legacy with his performance this season, leading the team in goals with 58 to this point.
Junior driver Kostas Genidounias is often overlooked but has been just as effective for the Trojans. His 56 goals on the year have been key, and his scoring often comes in critical moments of close contests for the Trojans.
Behind Genidounias and Vavic, the Trojans have managed to score a number of goals, but their defense has not been quite as dominant. The unit has averaged 5.3 goals allowed per game overall, but 8.5 goals per game in two MPSF matches. If USC is to win a record sixth straight national championship, Vavic said they must improve in that regard.
“We need to play better half-pool defense,” Vavic added.
If the Trojans can step up said defense, they’ll be in prime position for another national title run. Looking ahead, they have huge rivalry matchups with MPSF powerhouses California, Stanford and UCLA. The matchup with the Bruins will be the final regular season game before the conference championship tournament and, following that, the NCAA Tournament.
USC and Pacific will begin play in Stockton, Calif. at noon.

The USC women’s volleyball team pulled out a gutsy victory on Wednesday night by beating No. 6 Stanford on the road in five sets, but for head coach Mick Haley and the No. 4-ranked Women of Troy (19-3, 9-2 Pac-12), there is much left to be accomplished on this road trip.
With Wednesday night’s win, the Women of Troy keep pace behind Washington (17-1, 9-1) in the Pac-12 conference standings. USC currently stands at second place behind the Huskies, trailed closely by Stanford at 8-3 in the conference. Tonight’s opponents, the No. 22 California Golden Bears, are not far behind at 6-4 in conference play.
In the wide-open race to the top, Coach Haley knows just how important this stretch of the season is for his team.
“By beating Stanford twice, we’ve put ourselves in a great position to win the conference championship,” Haley said. “That’s important because it gives you a chance at a top-four seed in the NCAA tournament. With Washington only having one loss and us having two losses, and Washington having to play Stanford and us again, it keeps us in the hunt as long as we take care of business.”
USC will face Cal (13-6, 6-4) in Berkeley tonight in a rematch of arguably the most exciting match of the season for the Women of Troy. When these schools last saw each other on Oct. 6, the two squads took each other to the limit at the Galen Center.
The match saw set scores as close as 28-26 and as lopsided as 25-11 (USC’s win in the third set), but the most thrilling set was certainly the final one. With the score tied at 13, senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard smashed home a set from freshman setter Alice Pizzasegola to push the game to match point, and Olgard and sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio were able to team up on a block to finish the match.
This time around, the Women of Troy will meet the Golden Bears after prevailing in their only other five-set match of the season — a historic win at Stanford. USC’s defeat of the Cardinal marked the first time the Women of Troy had beaten Stanford on the road since 2006, and it also completed a season sweep against the conference rival, something they have managed to do only three times in school history.
The win on Wednesday night featured a strong defensive effort from both the frontcourt and backcourt. The Women of Troy out-blocked the Cardinal 11-10 at the net, and senior libero Natalie Hagglund finally reached the pinnacle of the USC all-time leaderboard in digs. With her 36 digs at Stanford, she now has 2,095 for her illustrious career and is ranked fifth all-time in Pac-12 history.
USC’s defensive play at the net is an especially encouraging sign for the team after their blocking struggles against Arizona and Washington in the past two weeks. Stanford came into the game as the nation’s leader in blocks per game at 3.04, but with a team effort the Women of Troy managed to beat the best at their own game.
The squad will have to bring the same type of effort to the match tonight as Cal features three strong hitters in senior Adrienne Gehan, junior Christina Higgins and redshirt sophomore Lillian Schonewise. In the match on Oct. 6, all three had upwards of 10 kills, and Gehan was especially dangerous with 22 kills in the match.
“Gehan gets most of the points with Higgins being her support,” said coach Haley, scouting his opponent. “Really, we have to keep an eye on those two. If we do that, we have a good chance to win.”
Offensively, the Women of Troy will look to continue to spread the ball around on offense and keep defenses guessing. With four different players in double digits for points against Stanford, USC continues to show that they are a well-rounded offensive team with several weapons.
Along with Olgard and Bricio, Haley is looking to see production from outside hitters senior Sara Shaw and freshman Ebony Nwaenbu who had 16.5 and 23.5 points against the Golden Bears last time around, respectively.
“There are two things you look for,” Haley said of his team’s offense. “Certainly as a player gets hot you have to give them additional opportunities. The other side is that the other team always gives you something. We’re balanced enough that we can exploit many different weaknesses in a defense.”
As Hagglund looks to continue to climb the Pac-12 leaderboard in digs, look for Bricio to keep up a streak of her own. Wednesday’s match against Stanford was her 13th straight with at least once service ace. In fact, Bricio has only been shut out once this entire season as a setter — only Eastern Washington was able to keep her sinking line-drive serve off of the ground for an entire match.
The match tonight will begin at 6 p.m. in Haas Pavilion and will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks. If the Women of Troy pull off the win, it will be their first regular season sweep of the Bay Area teams since 2003.

Two weeks ago, I got a really depressing email from my Victorian Literature professor. Without quoting him verbatim, it was a personal message from him telling me to “step my game up.” My performance in class hadn’t been up to par and, seeing as I took one of his classes last semester, he was fully aware of my capabilities. There are probably countless instances in which USC fans have wanted to tell their football team the exact same thing. For fans familiar with the game, there’s no place where this message would be more fitting than USC’s special teams.
In the game of football, perhaps the least-appreciated unit is special teams. In the college game, the prevailing assumption is that these players are younger, less experienced and altogether less skilled than their defensive and offensive counterparts. The most notable exception to this rule is usually the kick returner, and USC is no different — for the earlier part of the season, that title went to junior wide receiver Marqise Lee and later sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor.
But the play of special teams all begins with the kicker. The kick determines the movement of the other 21 players on the field. Junior Andre Heidari has been the placekicker for the Trojans since his freshman year. This season, the Trojans’ special teams have been anything but special — and it’s been Heidari who has been at the center of the team’s criticism. His 43-yard miss against Washington State probably cost the Trojans the game, and his misses from 40 and 46 yards against Notre Dame severely hurt the Trojans in South Bend.
So what’s eating Andre Heidari? It’s hard to put a finger on the exact point. Heidari tore his meniscus early in his sophomore year and has struggled to regain his confidence since. After notching a preposterous 15 of 17 in his freshman year, he put up a pedestrian 10 of 16 in his second season.
Two weeks ago, USC interim head coach Ed Orgeron announced that the placekicker’s job was an open competition. The coach’s decision was telling. It’s indicative of his leadership mentality. Orgeron is the all-too-willing facilitator of the Darwinistic microcosm that exists within any organized sports team. Make the walk-ons, junior Craig McMahon and sophomore Alex Wood, nip at Heidari’s heels. Though it’s doubtful either presented a serious threat, the approach seems to have worked, at least temporarily.
Heidari responded last week in the game against Utah, knocking in a career-high four field goals from 35, 38, 28 and 40 yards. But something about his performance still leaves room for doubt. Heidari will need to be consistent from long distances to regain the complete trust of the team. More importantly, he plays an integral role in USC’s offense this year. Some of USC’s most daunting opponents lie ahead, including a matchup against hard-hitting Stanford at home and, of course, the season finale against UCLA.
The Trojans haven’t been finishing drives with touchdowns as often this season, as the game against Utah revealed. Giving the Trojans a long-distance field goal kicking option changes the way opposing defenses play the Trojans. And though the Trojans should always be pushing for a touchdown, it’s always comforting to have a solid kicker to put three points on the board in the event the offensive line doesn’t hold up.
More than ever, it’s become urgent for Heidari to become a reliable source of scoring for the Trojans if USC expects to have any realistic expectation of salvaging the season and, perhaps, capturing the Pac-12 South.
The kicker sets the tone for special teams, but in many ways it can set the tone for the rest of the team as well. Heidari’s role on the team is to show poise in situations of immeasurable duress. In an interview with Rich Hammond of the Orange County Register, Heidari himself put it best when he described kicking as: “90 percent mental, 10 percent technique and everything else.”
Orgeron sent Heidari an implicit message to “step his game up.” Last Saturday, Heidari demonstrated why people believed he was capable of doing more. Prior to the Trojans’ game against Oregon State, Heidari has made 10 of 16 field goals: that equals his total mark from last year.
Time will only tell if he’s able to finish on a higher note and “step his game up.” But like my situation with the Victorian Literature class, something tells me both of us eventually will.
 
“Euno, It’s Saturday…” runs every other Friday. To comment on this story, email Euno at eunol@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.

Halloween is the night before USC’s road matchup against Oregon State — but the Trojans won’t enter their own personal “House of Horrors” until Friday night in their return to Corvallis, Ore., where they haven’t won since 2004.
Up in the air · Redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble missed last week’s game against Utah after suffering an injury against Notre Dame, but his status was updated to “probable” after Wednesday’s practice. – Daily Trojan file photo
The Trojans (5-3, 2-2) were shocked by the Beavers (6-2, 4-1) in Reser Stadium in 2006 and 2008 by narrow margins before being shellacked 36-7 in 2010.
One might think that USC would be motivated to avenge the losses of their predecessors, but interim coach Ed Orgeron insists that the team is simply focused on recording their first road win as a team since former coach Lane Kiffin was fired — and he’s not even allowing Halloween festivities to distract the team.
“Tomorrow is Thursday, Friday is game day. That’s about all we know right now,” Orgeron said on Wednesday. “I quit [dressing up for Halloween] when I was about five.”
Even though the players on the field probably won’t be thinking about “Day of the Dead” festivities, the raucous Corvallis crowd could be even more rowdy than usual with the combination of a holiday weekend and a Friday night game.
USC has been preparing for a chaotic atmosphere this week by constantly playing the sound of a revving chainsaw during practices, a common sound byte employed by Oregon State during crucial moments of the game.
But ultimately, if the Trojans are to emerge victorious from Corvallis for the first time in nearly a decade, the main focus will have to be on stopping the Beavers’ vaunted aerial attack.
Oregon State boasts both a quarterback in Sean Mannion that leads the nation in passing yards (3,263) by nearly 400 yards and a receiver in Brandin Cooks that ranks first in receiving yards (1,256) with a 155-yard cushion on his closest competitor.
“[Mannion] is a good player, but Brandin Cooks makes it go,” Orgeron said. “The guy is tremendous. They have a good scheme.”
It’s unclear who will be the main man on USC’s defense tasked with blanketing Cooks. Junior cornerback/safety Josh Shaw is sure to get a crack as the leader of the Trojans’ secondary, but Orgeron is keeping his hand close.
“Everyone’s gonna have their chance,” Orgeron said. “They put [Cooks] all over the field. He’s to the [wide side of the] field, he’s to the [side of the] boundary, they run fly sweeps with him. … So everybody’s gonna have a shot.”
Even though the Beavers exceeded expectations after starting off their season with a shocking 49-46 home loss to Eastern Washington, an FCS school, there is still reason to doubt that Oregon State has simply benefitted from a soft schedule to this point.
After rebounding from the head-scratching opener by reeling off six straight wins, the Beavers fell at home to No. 6 Stanford 20-12 last week as Mannion was sacked eight times. The junior threw for 271 yards while completing 41 of 57 passes for a subpar raw QB rating of 33.3, and Cooks was somewhat kept in check with 80 reception yards and the lone passing touchdown for the Beavers.
But with a large amount of USC’s players still banged up, there’s no telling if the Trojans could keep the game close if the Beavers do find success on offense.
Though the statuses of junior receiver Marqise Lee and redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble were upgraded to “probable” by Orgeron on Thursday, USC will likely be without redshirt senior tackle Kevin Graf and freshman safety Su’a Cravens, who were both injured in last week’s game against Utah.
“It would be a big help to have Grimble out there on Saturday,” Orgeron said. “It is what is, and we are going to have to accept the challenge.”
Kickoff is at 6 p.m. The game will be broadcast on ESPN2.

The last few years’ 3-D films have graduated from being perceived as a fad to a fully established part of the movie industry. The addition of 3-D seemed gimmicky at first as films had been able to adequately convey depth and stories in the traditional 2-D format. We have begun to see directors not only plan their films for the 3-D technology, however, but find new and artistically intriguing ways to utilize it, a major example being this year’s Gravity. As the novelty for 3-D films has died down, rumblings for the next step in the evolutionary process have gradually begun to get louder. Welcome to the world of 4-D films. It’s a brave new world, albeit a very murky one.
There has been an established 4-D theater in South Korea for a few years now, and a new 4-D theater made its debut in Japan this year with a screening of Iron Man 3. It has not, however, made much headway in the American market apart from amusement park attractions. When it comes to theatrical films, it is a largely untapped market in this day and age. There have been rumors of a 4-D theater to be built in New York as an experiment, but nothing much has come of it.
4-D has so far been reserved for special occasions involving children’s movies. One such occasion marks the presentation of Tim Burton’s Nightmare Before Christmas in 4-D at Hollywood’s El Capitan Theater through Nov. 3. Celebrating the film’s 20th anniversary, the theater is presenting a show with “lights, scent, wind, snow, fog & more” to enhance the film. If anything, it is worth a watch for the sheer novelty factor, and the slight possibility that this is a preview of future developments in the industry.
Of course, the concept of enhancing theatrical films beyond the visual has been tried before. The infamous Smell-O-Vision experiment in 1960 resulted in financial failure and has only been attempted a couple of times since. Both those times were admitted tributes to the idea as opposed to attempts at commercialization. The real paradise for 4-D film experiences has long been in amusement parks, where supplementing a film with moving chairs, smells and puffs of air suits the fabricated ambiance very well — not to mention the target demographic of young children. The whole 4-D experience is perfect for a child, and it is no wonder that the few inroads that have been made in this country so far have been done through children’s movies.
It is troubling to look across the Pacific and see the attempts at breaking this technology from the track of children’s attractions. Though at surface value it seems similar to the rise of 3-D films in terms of gimmickry, it is an entirely different animal. 3-D is another technology that failed to gain much financial traction when studios first tried it out several decades ago and its implementation then was very controversial, but it remained an essentially visual enhancement. As films are a visual art, this can be integrated with little issue, and this is why directors have been able to innovate so creatively with its use. On the other hand, it is very difficult to imagine Alfonso Cuarón finding a way to seamlessly use 4-D technology in his filmmaking. It is just so removed from the rest of the filmmaking process. 4-D will add non-visual aspects to a film, and because of this it will always be an add-on where 3-D can be integrated. This probably condemns the idea of using 4-D to boost profits to disappointment. A gimmick will work here or there but it is usually by no means a sustainable business strategy. Nevertheless, it has been reasonably successful overseas — successful enough to start those rumors of implementation stateside. It is difficult to say why it has found such success in Korea, although tastes naturally vary from country to country. But it is hard to see the experience being successful here in the states.
Say, however, that it does. Say the experiment works and it is commercially successful. Barring a miracle from some genius director, it still won’t actually be a part of the film. It will be a corruption of what it means to go to the movies. The inherent audiovisuality of the medium would be subverted for cheap thrills. Fortunately, it probably won’t happen. There will certainly be plenty of future innovations in the presentation of films accepted by audiences, and we have no way of knowing for sure now what those will be. The safe bet is that these will be visual innovations, new ways of presenting things and the way they are seen. So, El Capitan’s showings are probably not a portent of what’s to come in the film industry, but they sure seem like they could be fun to check out.

“Safe and Sound,” the smash hit from indie-pop band Capital Cities, has already accumulated more than 35 million views and the single has been topping radio charts worldwide. Ryan Merchant and Sebu Simonian comprise the band’s frontmen of this worldwide sensation, though the band shares roots a little closer to home. Merchant is a USC alumnus who majored in English when he was a student.

The band’s formation could be a scene straight from a Hollywood movie. The two met on Craigslist and immediately bonded over their mutual love for creating music.
“I was looking for someone to help me produce some of my songs, so we got together like that,” Merchant said. “Soon afterwards, [Sebu] and I fell into an opportunity to write music for TV commercials.”
Though the duo used commercial writing to get their foot in the door, two long years made the young 20-year-olds anxious for more. Both had aspirations to sing lead vocals and produce electronic music.
“While we were doing the TV ads, we were also doing a lot of other writing together,” Merchant said. “We eventually started writing songs on the side and decided to follow our ultimate goal in the music industry: start a band.”
And start a band they did. The two men trademarked the name Capital Cities in 2010 and began to devote all of their energy to creating melodies and songwriting. Merchant credits the duo’s differences as much as their similarities in achieving the band’s current success.
“I’m really interested in the writing process, while Sebu enjoys piano playing and is more of the technical one,” he said. “However, we also share a lot of overlapping skills, and [we] both love to produce and to be involved with a little bit of everything.”
Capital Cities’ differences also help facilitate the writing process.
“Sebu and I will sit there for hours writing melodies until something interesting comes out.”
Unlike many modern pop artists, however, the duo harbors an old-fashioned devotion to create quality music.
“Once we have the verse or melody for a song, it might take us two years to actually finish it,” Merchant said. “We have to go through the artistic process of really combing through the music to create the best possible result we can.”
Merchant also credits his time at USC for contributing to his writing style. As an English major, he admits to harboring a special appreciation for the written word. “Being able to write is such a valuable skill, not just in songwriting but in all aspects of life,” he said. “The English program [at USC] is so fantastic and helped me to become aware of the importance of the written word.”
Capital Cities credits their unique writing process for inspiring the music itself.
“I love sitting down with the computer or guitar and working with someone you have really good chemistry with,” Merchant said. “When the two of you stumble across something that feels fresh and you can listen to over and over again, you know you have something special.”
“Safe and Sound” was that something fresh, earning the band a 2013 MTV Video Music Award and propelling the artists to massive popularity worldwide.
The success of the song allowed the duo to experiment creatively for their follow-up single, “Kangaroo Court.” The music video follows a zebra’s attempt to attend a club where zebras are forbidden. The zebra attempts to mask himself and sneak in, but eventually finds himself in a sticky situation in an animal courtroom.
The video’s concept was long in the making for Merchant and Simonian.
“We came up with the idea about a year and a half ago with our manager,” Merchant said. “We didn’t have the budget then, but after signing with Capitol Records, they were extremely supportive of the concept and allowed us to go a little outside of the box for the video. We had a great director and are really proud of the finished result.”
As far as going outside the box, Michael Jackson and Daft Punk are just two of the musical artists that the band credits as their inspiration for doing things a little differently.
“Michael Jackson is the biggest and most obvious influence for our music,” Merchant said. “[He] is who inspired me to become a musician and a performer.”
The band’s debut album, In A Tidal Wave of Mystery, showcases some obvious Jackson influences. The album features contributions from a variety of artists, including hip-hop artist Andre 3000. The Southern rapper helped produce and write “Farrah Fawcett Hair,” Merchant’s favorite song from the album.
“It’s a tongue-in-cheek song that also features some very powerful moments,” he said. “Getting to work with [Andre 3000] to create the bridge was an amazing experience.”
What comes next for these two already widely successful artists? Merchant’s vision is simple enough: continued success.
“We both want to continue touring and, hopefully, have more songs that will do [well] on the radio,” he said. “Continuing to evolve musically is a big goal for both of us, and we’re really excited to get back in the studio for the next album.”
In the meantime, the band just embarked on a five-week tour with fellow indie-pop band, Fitz and the Tantrums. Not only are the two bands tour-mates, but they also share a strong friendship.
“We played a lot of the same festivals this summer and decided to join forces for this tour,” Merchant said. “I think it will be a great experience for the crowd to witness two bands with different sounds, but are both very high energy.”
Capital Cities will perform at the Greek Theatre on Saturday. As a special treat for his alma mater, Merchant said fans can expect a few surprises and guest vocalists.

This year has marked the release of several large-scale science fiction films criticized for plots lacking in substance. Elysium, Oblivion, Pacific Rim and After Earth all showed majestic glimpses into futuristic worlds but disappointed in terms of plot. Ender’s Game is the latest foray into the realm of presenting futuristic beauty on the screen, but this version does it with a much more complex plot as it is based upon Orson Scott Card’s classic sci-fi novel of the same name.
The young commander · British actor Asa Butterfield (right) stars as Andrew Wiggin in Ender’s Game, the new film adaptation of Orson Scott Card’s 1985 science fiction novel of the same name. The film is set in 2086, when an alien race attacks Earth and threatens its existence. – Photo courtesy of Lionsgate Films
The story revolves around the training of 12-year-old Ender Wiggin to defend the Earth from alien invaders. The leaders of Earth’s military decide that children, through their ability to think differently, are better suited to analyze the complex battle situations put before them, so the children are put through rigorous training and testing in the search of the ones who could possibly lead the world’s defense. Wiggin stands out from his peers and is noticed by the head of the battle school. Soon, his rise to the top is expedited.
Wiggin is played by young Asa Butterfield, who we last saw as the title character in Hugo. Butterfield is great at expressing the very complex range of emotions that Wiggin experiences in his challenging training process while remaining very understated. Very impressive stuff from the 16-year-old actor.
The original novel is lauded for both its complex look at the morality of violence and the difficulties Wiggin faces as a young man isolated from his peers. The film focuses on both these aspects a great deal. The superior that takes a special interest in Wiggin, played by Harrison Ford, has a major role in both of these important narratives. In his best role since the ’90s, Ford presents a complex leader willing to manipulate Wiggin into committing acts of violence for the greater cause while isolating him and providing him with obstacles to hone his leadership skills. With recent roles in classics such as Cowboys and Aliens, Paranoia and Morning Glory, it’s nice to see Ford sink his teeth into such an interesting role, especially a major sci-fi classic.
The novel has taken 28 years since its publication to be adapted to film, and Card has played a major part in this. In stark contrast to the fast-track-to-the-screen treatment that popular young adult novels receive these days, the script underwent numerous rewrites and production was delayed constantly. Though Card’s primary concern was the treatment of the novel and the themes essential to its purpose, it is not hard to see the effect that modern technology has had on the final product as opposed to the movie we may have gotten in 1985. As maligned as the extensive use of CGI has been in recent times it has given us breathtaking visuals this year, especially in sci-fi films. Ender’s is fantastic in this regard. The zero-gravity training battles and full-scale war scenes could certainly have been made to some extent in the mid-’80s — the Star Wars original trilogy had been completed by this time after all — but it is difficult to believe that they would’ve looked this impressive. The battle scenes are vast and absorbing, and the camera work in the weightless situation frames the multidimensionality of the action.
The film surpasses this year’s previous efforts at sci-fi epics in terms of balancing style and substance, and yet something seems to be off. It doesn’t match the atmospheric style of Oblivion or the impressive action of Pacific Rim. (After Earth’s distinctive nepotism is also missing, but not all failures to match this year’s sci-fi films are bad things). Something seems to be lacking. It does everything more than competently (acting, directing, writing) but it fails to come together as anything more than the sum of its parts. It’s never enthralling. Perhaps a major reason for this is the extent to which the movie remained faithful to the philosophical aspects of the book. Though not as prevalent, the details are pervasive to the point of becoming distracting from the story at times. The commitment to adhering to all these important notes of meaning seemed to have handcuffed Gavin Hood, the film’s director, a bit too much.
This is not a dealbreaker, as the film remains entertaining. This lack of a soul, however, undermines the meatier story it boasts in comparison to its 2013 sci-fi competitors. It impresses, but doesn’t amaze.

In response to “Healthcare website spurs problems”
 
I am deeply concerned by the level of misinformation present in Ms. Valerie Yu’s opinion piece on the Affordable Care Act, which appeared in the Oct. 29 issue of the Daily Trojan.
Writers of opinion pieces are entitled to exactly that: opinions. This letter aims to examine the facts presented in Ms. Yu’s piece and to express concern for the danger the DT faces in terms of quality and credibility if its editors continue to publish similarly inaccurate pieces.
Ms. Yu writes: USA Today reported that 700,000 applications were submitted this week.” That USA Today report actually reads that over 700,000 applications have been submitted since Oct 1. This information is in the first sentence of that report. Yu’s piece goes on to argue that healthcare.gov crashing due to high volume combined with penalties for the uninsured means that “the prospects for universal healthcare don’t look good.”
The Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” is not universal healthcare. Even Fox News makes sure to call “Obamacare” a step toward universal healthcare. To claim anything otherwise would be a flat-out lie.
I hope that it was negligence on behalf of the editors of the Daily Trojan that allowed this to happen because this is pure misinformation. Furthermore, the extent to which there will be “penalties for the uninsured” is debatable. I would direct readers to an informative article by Mike Patton in Forbes.
Ms. Yu goes on to quote a former commissioner of Social Security from The Weekly Standard. There is nothing factually wrong here, except an editor should realize that this is not a credible source but rather quoting an opinion second hand. Ms. Yu, however, extrapolates a fact from this: “Unaccountable workers, known as navigators, will have access to Social Security numbers and other private information.” Navigators are accountable, otherwise they wouldn’t be certified, nor do they have access to personal information unless it was willingly offered in person whilst completing the application.
Lastly, Ms. Yu makes questionable use of an article in The National Review by John Fund. One claim is that because of the health care law linking federal agency records, the enrollment in Obamacare is the “largest consolidation of personal data in our nation’s history.” Not only is this claim hardly verifiable, but it has nothing to do with copycat scam websites.
My intention is not to chastise Ms. Yu; she makes excellent points on the cybersecurity concerns of healthcare.gov and I completely agree that many of the problems with the execution of the ACA should have been avoided.
However, this is not the first time pieces in the Daily Trojan have caused me concern.
The DT is and should be a respected news source with a wide readership. As a college newspaper it is not beholden to the private interests of corporate news organizations. As such, it is critical to the well-being of the fourth estate.

On Oct. 22, CNBC reported Netflix’s stock growth. Netflix, an on-demand Internet streaming service, grew from $7.7 million in net income to an empire of $31.8 million or 52 cents a share. The company’s monetary value more than quadrupled — an effort that look place within the span of 2013. Netflix’s increasing influence, however, degrades the traditional and celebrated entertainment experience.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
Netflix’s growth can be attributed to the array of television and film networking it provides. Popular movies, including top-grossing ones, pop up in the suggestions. Television shows, some with the largest, most fanatic followings, decorate Netflix’s programming vault. This spring, Netflix introduced original television shows, such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, both of which were lauded by critics. These features, according to CNBC, lead to an ever-growing subscriber base. According to The New York Times, in September, Netflix had 40.4 million subscribers, domestically and overseas. This is another statistic that has more than quadrupled — Netflix users only numbered 10 million in 2009.
Before the beginning of this Netflix craze, movie magic was still intact. Popcorn scents danced in the air as theatergoers expected trailers and the lights to dim as the curtains drew back to reveal a big screen. Throughout the film, the audience is bonded by an array of emotions the movie inspires. Viewers hold their breath at the most climatic portion, rooting for the main character to demolish the antagonist. This same feeling of anticipation is experienced by fans of a specific television show, waiting week after week for a new episode. It doesn’t matter if the show is complete with a laugh track or suspenseful music- what is the most uneasy yet integral feeling is tuning in next week to be met with another cliffhanger.
Netflix  eliminates this element of entertainment in society by having its products readily available. Part of why seeing a movie in theaters, as opposed to on a small  laptop screen, is such a treasured experience is due to a feeling of total immersion. A horror movie shown on a laptop, where one is afforded the opportunities to press pause and play, cannot compare to a horror movie bolstered by amplified sounds and sights at the movie theater. Similarly, waiting for a specific show to come on after a cliffhanger the previous week surpasses Netflix’s ability to skip to the “good parts.” Movies and television cannot be seen as their respective bodies of work; they come packaged by their experiences.
True fans line up for hours to catch the midnight premiere of The Hunger Games or Harry Potter. Trekkies are more of a community than individuals of extreme fandom, going to conventions and purchasing merchandise. People are bonded by their affinity for their favorite movie or television show. They return what these films or shows give them—a feeling of warmth or belonging-—by paying for a movie ticket or joining a group. Netflix tarnishes this system of appreciation; individuals who would traditionally head to the theaters for a film now wait until the movie hits Netflix.
Furthermore, Netflix bombards its users with its endless amounts of entertainment. With so much to watch, more than 100,000 titles according to The New York Times, people binge and watch them all. This, in effect, negatively affects the television and film industry by blocking people from watching on the original platform. According to Peter Kafka of All Things Digital, without cable television, beloved shows will be pulled from lineups. According to USA Today, the next move for Netflix is to produce original movies, further obstructing the entertainment industry.
Netflix is undoubtedly a revolutionary agent in the entertainment industry, changing the way movies and television shows are processed. It has removed the need for Blockbuster and other video rental stores because of its convenience to a technologically-advanced public. But individuals must recognize that Netflix actually hampers the film community, which has traditionally been a group of artistic individuals. One solution to this problem is for Netflix to host a forum where users can interact and contribute their thoughts on films after viewing them.
It’s important not to obstruct the overall experience or stunt thought. Entertainment is not made for entertainment’s sake. Even though Netflix says, “You get more for your money,” people are missing out on the experiences crucial to regular programming.

I’d like to thank the writer for the well-written piece and insight provided by his or her opinion. Having a Netflix subscription, I see things a bit differently. I do want to mention that I was one of those that were disappointed by Netflix when they created a separate pricing plan for streaming as initially it was part of their home delivery service.
I have no reason to defend Netflix, but I was blessed with the ability to distinguish the burden of responsibility.
Netflix did not create the world where people could spoil a movie and reduce the excitement between episodes of a tv program. The sales of videotapes and dvds had already done that. In watching new shows created by Netflix such as House of Cards, the burden of maintaining the suspense really falls on the end user watching the program. Yes, the writer does bring up a good point about waiting out a week to create suspense, but this show was not necessarily designed with that in mind. Most writers create suspense to not lose the viewer despite the time when the last episode was seen. During the recent cable airing of Breaking Bad, the week-to-week suspense still existed yet Netflix was one of the mediums that helped make it popular. These new episodes have yet to be available on Netflix, but there is a deepening need for those wanting to see it to watch it.
Lastly, it takes awhile before flicks are available on streaming, so I still catch new run movies in the theaters, therefore the movie magic is still there. How can one not want to see a space-related movie on a big screen?
With the exception of their original programming, all movies and tv show content are available through mediums such as dvds by the time they are available on Netflix. Therefore, how could Netflix have ruined the entertainment experience? If it is their original content we are talking about, I am suspensefully waiting for Season 2 of House of Cards to be released.  How does Netflix hamper the film community when it is merely providing a convenient access point to its content long after the movie has made its sales in the box offices and dvd sales. People still buy dvds of new movies they like despite Netflix streaming as it’d take many years before it reaches them. Depending on studio agreements, it may never reach them, such as Disney flicks.

Graphic artist Shepard Fairey, designer of the Barack Obama Hope poster, surprised two USC classes yesterday by dropping in to explain his life’s work of exposing cultural truths and inspiring social change through graphic and street art.
Students in the School of Cinematic Arts’ IML 420: “New Media for Social Change” and the Roski School of Fine Arts’ PAS 371: “Art in the Public Realm” class asked Fairey questions about his work for the last 30 years.
“I reclaim American symbols and turn them toward change,” Fairey said of his art. “There ought to be windmills where the buffalo roam.”
Fairey emerged in the art scene in the late ‘80s with his grassroots “Andre the Giant Has A Posse” campaign that has since spread worldwide.
“The OBEY poster was not about a specific social change, just that there are forces that want you to submit that are more covert that overt,” Fairey said. “You have to realize that you have choices to make about structures you follow.”
Fairey has also produced art for the Occupy movement, the Japanese tsunami relief effort and environmental change. He is also launching a series, Rebel Music, with MTV-U that will focus on young people in areas of conflict around the world and use music and art to sponsor change
Fairey, who was wearing a leather jacket and Sex Pistols T-shirt, said that he wanted to reach a larger audience with his work outside the elite, privileged circles of the art world. Street art has allowed Fairey to get his message across to a wider demographic.
“I used everything at my disposal to get [my message] out,” he said. “The age of only showing in galleries and in elite circles is really not relevant anymore. Figure out ways to engage people meaningfully and powerfully but take into account a very short attention span. You really need to take it to people.”
Sometimes Fairey’s methods, however,  have gotten him in trouble with the law. He has been arrested 16 times for vandalism.
In 2008, Fairey’s iconic Obama Hope poster went viral and became one of the most widely recognized symbols of the Obama campaign.
“I opposed the Bush agenda from 2000 on and thought I should make work opposing the Iraq War and shrinking civil liberties,” he said. “At the time, he seemed to be the antithesis of these ideas.”
Though the poster appeared on street corners, billboards and bus stops around the country, it was also very popular on the Internet. Fairey said the digital side of his art allows him to expand his message.
“Before, people would see my work on the street and think, ‘Yeah, that’s punk rock,’” he said. “Now, you can write about whatever you believe in. It’s an opportunity to share the concepts and statistics behind my art. You draw them in with the visual but this can be the pathway to finding out a lot about an issue.”
For the Japanese tsunami relief effort, Fairey tried to create a beautiful aesthetic with an underlying social message. He sold his print, Dark Wave/Rising Sun, to raise money for the Japanese Red Cross.
“When it’s a heavy topic, people don’t want to feel worse,” he said.
Fairey, however, has not always been a fan of his popularity. He pointed out the proliferation of his clothing line on figures such as Justin Bieber.
“I’ve seen frat guys [wearing my T-shirts] and it’s just made me really nauseous,” he said.
The “New Media for Social Change” class studies theory but implements them through digital media. The “Art in the Public Realm” class focuses on art in the public realm that has social or political issues in mind.
Overall, Fairey says he creates his art in part to remind people of the absurdity of some of the claims that are made by the government and large corporations.
“I encourage people to question the propaganda,” he said. “I make propaganda to get people to question propaganda.”

More than any other era of recorded music since Edison’s wax cylinders, the modern listener enjoys complete freedom in how they acquire music. Spotify, iTunes, piracy, radio, YouTube — the list goes on and on. But the one format that seems to be the most rare nowadays are the “little silver discs” that Arcade Fire sings about on the title track of their newest album, Reflektor.
In this fragmented, electronic age, few albums hold the same sort of commanding power and audacity that Reflektor does. The album brings to mind similarly massive art rock albums from the bygone days of album-oriented rock: The Wall, Tusk and Exile on Main St. More than any of their first three albums, Arcade Fire wants Reflektor to be an artistic statement, never minding the pretentions of that concept.
What exactly, then, are they stating that takes an hour and 15 minutes to say? The band’s first three albums tackle universal themes: family, religion, alienation. Reflektor takes aim at another: distance. The title track and album opener lambastes the social media revolution, asking, “We’re still connected, but are we even friends?” The distance grows no less unbridgeable by the time of the album closer, “Supersymmetry,” when married singers Win Butler and Régine Chassagne lament that they “heard a voice like an echo / but it came from you.” In between the two, the lyrics suffer some, especially on tracks such as the hard-rocking “Normal Person” where Butler lamely asks, “Is anything as strange as a normal person?” But overall, the album’s lyrics gracefully depict emotions that fit just as easily a teenage suburbanite as Orpheus and Eurydice.
The ancient Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice finds new life as the album’s two centerpieces “Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice)” and “It’s Never Over (Oh Orpheus).” Arcade Fire has often used narrative links between their songs, from the “Neighborhood” suite from their 2004 debut, Funeral, to the full concept album that was 2010’s The Suburbs. In these two songs, they recast the tragic Greek lovers as a young couple “born in a little town.” But even more than the Orpheus songs, the two parts of “Here Comes The Night Time” represent the true lyrical centerpieces of the album. Disc one includes the bright, dub-influenced first half that assaults the hypocrises of missionaries such as those who travel to Haiti. The second disc’s second half takes a musical turn away from the sun and mourns “how low we go, my friends / feels like it never ends.”
The Caribbean nation of Haiti plays a larger part in this album than any other Arcade Fire album. Female lead singer Régine Chassagne comes from Haitian roots and Funeral featured the highlight track “Haiti,” but the group never truly explored the nation from a musical angle rather than a lyrical one. During the tour for The Suburbs, however, Butler and Chassagne took an extended trip to Haiti and encountered the area’s local “rara” music. The band then brought rara into their already-diverse sonic palette — an influence that rings most clearly on tracks such as “Here Comes The Night Time” and “Afterlife.”
The biggest musical change between Reflektor and the band’s previous work is the added presence of James Murphy as producer. Murphy formerly acted as lead singer and songwriter for LCD Soundsystem, a short-lived band that released three masterpiece albums in the early 2000s and disbanded as quickly. Murphy brings his familiar styles to Reflektor, a change that led some fans to begin calling the band Arcade Soundsystem. In proper LCD Soundsystem fashion, the average track length here exceeds six minutes. Also, tracks such as “Porno” and “Flashbulb Eyes” feature the same odd synthesized percussion for which Murphy became famous. But most importantly, Murphy maintains Arcade Fire’s trademark layered, emotional sound and gives it a groove and a physicality.
Though there might not be many little silver discs of Reflektor floating around to be listened to, the album still represents an attempt at a singular, cohesive work: an artistic statement from a band infamous for artistic statements. Even though there’s not much of a chance that you or anyone else will listen to it in order, there’s something beautiful and profound about these 14 tracks. The album may not hold the highest highs of Funeral, but it easily ranks as one of the best albums of the year. Just try looking inside. God knows what you might find.
