The Undergraduate Student Government held its last in-person senate meeting of the semester Tuesday night. 
At the start of the meeting, a representative from USC Racing, a student-run team that creates and races high-performance autocross cars, Jonathan Laifman, and two representatives from USC’s Formula Electric design team, Sunvriti Khanna and Trey Kee, said USG approved professional funding for the two organizations to participate in a competition against universities around the globe in Michigan in June but were notified last week that USG does not fund summer events.
“Unfortunately, automobile racing is something that you can’t get into without substantial money, believe me, I’ve tried,” said Kee, a sophomore majoring in psychology. “Going to this competition was really contingent on the funding that we received from USG.”
The funding would have helped cover hotel and transportation expenses. They were told that they would be given $4300 after requesting $4500 but never received the money, according to Kee. 
“Since they had approved the proposal, we in reliance ceased searching for new funding opportunities, notified internships, and booked rooms,” said Laifman, a senior majoring in physics. “However, now that they pulled the funding, it puts us in a difficult situation of finding new funding. We are hoping to find a way to have an exception to their “no summer” rule to be able to help cover this race as a first step toward fixing the rule such that all students can benefit from funding during summer.”
Vice president Nivea Krishnan said USG will discuss the issue during their cabinet meeting. Chief funding officer Brian Stowe will meet with both organizations Wednesday to resolve this issue. 
“Because that funding was already promised to us, a lot of us already made the payments for the hotels and transportation,” Khanna, a senior majoring in communication, said. “Now the extra expenses kind of fall on the heads of the business leads or the project managers who have to pay out of pocket because they expected the funding to come through USG and now that funding has been pulled last minute, it would be tough for us to get any sponsors at all.”
Senator Yoav Gillath announced that Trojans Give Back and USC Hospitality worked on a program to donate dining dollars to the USC Office of Basic Needs and compile them into meal swipes that have no expiration date. The donation period will be happening between May 4 and May 11. On the Mobile Order app, students will be prompted on whether or not they want to donate their remaining meal swipes if there are any remaining May 11. 
The senate also voted on nominations to the communications department announced at last week’s senate meeting, confirming them all unanimously. 
“We plan on really maintaining and strengthening our relationship with our media partners and RSOs and campus administrators to really cultivate strong relationships and to open transparency,” newly confirmed director of public relations Jacob Wheeler said. 
The communications department envisions a redesign for the USG website that highlights the resources offered by USG and hopes to establish a bigger presence for students, associate director of digital strategy Oscar Clavio said. 
The senate then debated and voted on the legislative department’s committee chair and parliamentary secretary nominations announced at last week’s senate meeting, confirming them all unanimously.
Tuesday’s senate meeting was the last one of the academic year to be held in person, but USG plans to hold two more senate meetings over the summer virtually to pass their 2022-23 budget.

There are currently no new coronavirus-related guidelines from Los Angeles County in place for commencement, set for May 13, but the University encourages attendees to screen for symptoms, avoid attending if they feel ill and wear masks, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Tuesday. 
USC Student Health recommends students who plan to attend commencement or leave campus mid-May to test beforehand, especially if traveling to visit family that may be at higher risk.
Student Health will remain open for the entirety of the summer to provide all of its usual resources and services to students seeking medical care. If a student is not registered for classes over the summer and would like to receive health treatment from Student Health, they must opt in to its services by purchasing the Student Health Services Fee. The fee is not necessary for students to continue using coronavirus testing services.
Student Health hours may modify, Van Orman said, but testing services are expected to remain open on weekdays. USC’s coronavirus dashboard, which tracks case numbers among students and employees, will also be updated weekly over the summer. 
The University recorded nearly 10,000 student coronavirus cases since the University began testing students in March 2020. 
“I was shocked to know that we’ve managed about 10,000 cases of COVID through the past, over two years now,” Van Orman said.  
Last week, 112 students and eight faculty members tested positive for the coronavirus. An additional 40 students and eight employees tested positive for the coronavirus using at-home rapid tests. More than 90% of these cases are of the BA.2 variant, Van Orman said.
“Those numbers are lower than before,” Van Orman said. “We know we’re testing fewer people, but [cases] are remaining elevated. They still are elevated compared to where we were previous to Spring Break.”
USC hosted the Spring football game Saturday, which boasted more than 30,000 attendees. USC also hosted the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books last weekend, which attracted nearly 150,000 visitors but required strong vaccine verification for indoor events.
“The Festival of Books does tend not to interact in terms of a population mixing with that many of our student and faculty population,” Van Orman said.  “I think those of us who are watching this are watching all of this closely because we had Easter weekend, going into Festival of Books, going into commencement and other kinds of travel.”
The University is also continuing to conduct wastewater testing in residence halls. Last week, some residence halls saw a spike in wastewater detection — particularly those located in USC Village. Students living in these buildings were requested to test by the University. Student Health is still waiting on wastewater results from this week. 
Although cases are still elevated, Van Orman said she does not anticipate any policy changes before the end of the semester. 
“What would drive that would be if something changed dramatically in the county in terms of health care, hospitalizations or severe disease,” Van Orman said. “We’re not seeing anything change at the county level, and so we really don’t see anything changing this semester.”
At this point, there are also no plans to change coronavirus guidelines for the fall semester. However, Student Health expects changes in vaccine requirements. 
“It’s a moment for all of us to take a big breath and sigh of relief. We really want to thank students actually, and faculty and staff for their cooperation,” Van Orman said. “It’s hard to believe that just at the beginning of this semester, we were faced with a delayed start because of the huge surge. I think students have done throughout this a great job complying with all the policies.”

Students, alongside tech industry professionals, spoke at the first-ever Tech4Good Student Symposium Tuesday night at Bovard Auditorium. Startup founders, ethical technology advocates and programmers included in the lineup spoke about the potential dangers of technological advancement and how they’ve found ways to use technology for social good. 
Coordinated by Shift SC, a student organization focused on “human-centered and socially responsible technology,” the event had more than 30 students and USC community members in attendance.
Adam Novak, a junior majoring in computer science and East Asian languages and cultures, founded Shift SC last year to spark a conversation about the ethical problems and potential consequences posed by technology, despite its benefits. 
“We’re basically looking at the ways technology creates unintended consequences in society and how we can shift technology as a whole towards the better,” Novak said. 
Shift SC Symposium initiative lead Caroline Kenney opened the event with a talk about why she joined the organization and planned the event. She drew inspiration from her father, who lost his hearing entirely as a child. When he had his daughter, he decided to get a cochlear implant to be able to hear her voice. Kenney said she saw firsthand how technology could be used to improve, or even transform, people’s lives. 
“I envisioned the Tech4Good Student Symposium as an opportunity for USC students to share how they have used technology to improve human lives,” said Kenney, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering. “Part of what makes the USC community so special is that our students want to change the world. This event highlights students who are changing the world through technology.”
Following Kenney’s opening address, Novak spoke to the audience about his journey from a USC freshman enamored by technology and programming — yet, somewhat disillusioned by the lack of discussions about ethics and social responsibility in his computer science classes — to his summer-long experience in a Buddhist monastery living as a monk and back to USC with a newfound drive to harness technology’s capacity for social good. 
“I wanted to cure this disorientation and this loneliness I felt as a freshman by finding others who similarly care about how technology affects our society,” Novak said. “Each of us had come to the same conclusion: we need a shift in tech.”
David Jay, chief mobilization officer at the Center for Humane Technology, delivered the symposium’s keynote address. The Center, which was involved in the production of the 2020 Netflix documentary “The Social Dilemma,” shares a similar mission to Shift SC, centered on “humane technology that supports our well-being, democracy, and shared information environment.” Jay classified the dilemma of technology’s societal impact as a crisis, similar to that of climate change. 
“In the same way that it’s incredibly profitable to take carbon out of the ground and put it in the air, it’s incredibly profitable to extract your attention and develop technology that tries to manipulate your behavior,” Jay said. “Even though it’s incredibly profitable, it’s also incredibly harmful.”
Some of Jay’s speech struck an optimistic tone, comparing the current ethical technology movement to the budding environmental sustainability movement of the 1990s. He also informed the audience of two bills making their way through the California legislature which would regulate how companies develop technology for children.
After Jay’s keynote address, USC alumni Brian Femminella and Travis Chen spoke to the audience about SoundMind, a music and visual therapy application they developed together. The app is targeted towards people who have anxiety, depression, trauma and other mental health struggles. 
“Technology should not be something that we shy away from,” Chen said. “It’s part of what this world has become and we’ve adapted to, so being able to use technology for positive things and look at it in a way that can help us, help our mental wellbeing and help our mental health — that’s what we want people to take away from [our speech].”
The event’s student speakers included Carson Mogush, a tech lead for USC’s Code the Change; Surya Nehra, a senior who developed a model to forecast diseases in regions with less available data; and Arman Patel, president of Effective Altruism USC. 
The final student speaker of the event was Manushri Desai, a senior majoring in public policy and healthcare studies. Desai also spoke at the United Nations twice, in 2019 and 2020, and gave a TEDxUSC talk in March. Her talk at the symposium centered on her experience in the disability justice movement and technology’s role in it. Desai partnered with Voice of Specially Abled People, an organization dedicated to the advancement of people with disabilities, to develop a mobile application map of physical accessibility in different USC locations.  
“The disability justice movement is so inextricably linked to all of us in a lot of ways that we don’t readily realize,” said Desai in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Being able to just connect with others one-on-one through the Tech4Good symposium platform really provided me with an opportune space to voice how people could make a difference in this area, and especially with the use of technology.” 
Novak, similar to many of the speakers that he, Kenney and their team brought to the event, spoke optimistically about the future of technology despite its current and potential consequences of which he warned.
“I’ve spoken with similar student orgs’ leaders around the country,” Novak said in his remarks. “Whether in [Los Angeles], Palo Alto, Boston, everywhere, students just like us feel the same way. We see problems which tech has created; we see problems which tech can solve and we see that we have the ability and responsibility to do something about them.”

Just last month, a story went viral about an assistant principal at a Mississippi school who was fired after reading “I Need a New Butt!” — a “fun, silly book” — to a group of second grade students. He only read the book after he was told to share a story when the principal failed to show up as planned.
This month, children’s author Jason Tharp was told he couldn’t share his book, “It’s OK to Be A Unicorn,” during a visit to Buckeye Valley West Elementary in Ostrander, Ohio. He was told by the school board that his book, which is about a proud rainbow unicorn who comes to terms with his identity, might “recruit kids to become gay.”
States have brought bills to the Senate to remove books that cover racial and sexual identity, while librarians have been threatened with criminal charges for stocking books that incorporate these topics. With this, it feels as though we are regressing in our ways with education.
It is not just young second graders deprived of literature about race and sexuality. The McMinn County Board of Education in Tennessee removed “Maus,” a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, for “curse words and nudity” from an eighth grade module on the Holocaust.
While book bans have always been a staple of school board meetings and have existed since the 1600s, these bans are only hurting the American education system. 
According to the American Library Association, the rate of books banned in 2021 was higher than ever — since they began tracking 20 years ago. The Library Association “counted 729 challenges to library, school and university material. Each challenge can contain multiple book titles, causing a total of 1,597 individual book challenges.” 
While not every book contains topics that a kindergartener is mature enough to discuss, such as violence or sex, these discretions can be left to a teacher trained to cater to their students. There is a significant difference between showing age appropriate content and censoring conversations about race and sexuality.
“What we’re seeing right now is an unprecedented campaign to remove books from school libraries but also public libraries that deal with the lives and experience of people from marginalized communities,” said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, the director of the American Library Association’s office for intellectual freedom, in an interview with The New York Times.
An assistant principal being fired for reading a picture book or an author being told he can’t share his picture book about self-acceptance sends a much deeper message. It becomes less about protecting children and more about censoring them from real-world topics where critical learning and understanding is necessary. 
The education system has become a playground for political conflict. People are pushing for educational content that matches their personal beliefs, but education cannot reflect the values of only one political party, race, gender, religion or sexuality. A lack of access to books, particularly those discussing Black and Indigenous people and people of color and LGBTQIA communities, is a conscious attempt to leave out marginalized groups from the educational experience of a country.
Children see race and identity. Their interactions alone tell them that sex and race exist and play a critical role in society. However, if educators shy away from these topics, how will they understand the impact on their lives and others? It is never too early to start learning about these topics, but it is too late for many who grew up believing in racist, sexist and homophophic rhetoric to change their ways.
While it is inevitably the decision of a family and an individual to choose what they believe and consume, the choice must remain. It is not the right of a school board or a state to prevent education on the lived experiences of many in our world. Rather than controlling what is taught, banning books tends to control what perspectives are shared.
What is happening in Ohio and Mississippi affects children’s education and their perception of the world throughout their life. Furthermore, not only is the impact detrimental to those whose lived experiences are being censored, but it is detrimental to higher education as well. 
As Kal Alston, education professor and associate dean for academic affairs at Syracuse University, said in an Inside Higher Ed story, the censorship of a student’s curriculum — whether at the hands of a parent or the school board — affects critical thinking and independent thinking, both of which are critical for success in higher education.
The conversations about these topics will never end, and students should be able to enter college comfortable with discussing race and sexuality. When they aren’t, it only hurts their own learning journey and that of those around them.

A looming graduation date may either rein in excitement or trigger anxiety similar to an impending doomsday. For many, the latter may be the reality, especially for those who thrive on order and familiarity. 
In the American school system, transitioning from being a student to a working adult rids the sense of safety that comes with having been the former for the past 16 or so years. Shifting societal values become more extrinsically motivated — such as having wealth and a successful career — as you enter the workforce.
Inscribed on Tommy Trojan are the five qualities of the ideal Trojan: faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous and ambitious. For USC students, the perceived ideal image of a Trojan shows that they should not feel fear.
There is an immense pressure to succeed and to succeed early — a Darwinian-like competition where only the fittest can survive. Our brain’s most impressive innovation is its ability to manage threats and evaluate risk and reward. We, as humans, possess the neocortex: an advanced system in the brain that analyzes risk.
According to the American Psychological Association, people who struggle to cope with the uncertainty of the future may have an unusually large striatum, an area of the brain associated with general anxiety disorder. This discovery could help treat symptoms of anxiety by marking activity of the striatum throughout treatment. 
Higher education has become very linear and impersonal. Colleges teach what has already been done — you make a four-year coursework plan and fulfill your general education and major requirements in order to graduate with a degree. This calls for a less standardized pedagogy that tailors to the personalized needs of students and their talents. 
College dropouts such as Oprah Winfrey and Sofía Vergara have traveled paths separate from the confines of the formal education system. They are self-starters who have dared to innovate on their own.
At USC, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of problem-solving and to teach skills that remain relevant in a changing world that values innovation. USC offers real-world electives such as “The Power of Personal Finance” and “Introduction to Business for Non-Majors;” however, they are not quite as popular and should be advertised more among students. 
It’s important to remember that college is only four years of your life. To those who are experiencing graduation anxiety — remember how much life you have ahead of you.
Learning continues beyond college; graduation is just another stopping point in our journey.

Julia Sposito finds time amid a busy academic schedule to do the one thing that feels absolutely right to her: songwriting. 
A junior majoring in business administration, Sposito believes her life’s purpose includes making music and plans to kick off the summer with the release of her new single “Summer Thing” in early May. 
Since receiving her first guitar at age 14, Sposito has written more than a thousand songs, transcribing lyrics as soon as they come to her and refining them into polished pieces, produced under her artist name “Juls.” These lyrical revelations happen anywhere and at any time for the artist, who is prone to daydreaming about potential song lyrics, even if it’s in the middle of a lecture. 
“I’ve found that sometimes I write really good songs just because I’m forced to go to some business class and I drift off,” Juls said. “I’m in this ethereal, beautiful landscape of songwriting.”
Juls’ music boasts a strength in lyricism and a pertinent attention to the small, odd moments in our lives that hold a surprising well of relatability that listeners can connect over; specific moments of the everyday that can be pinpointed to reveal their universality. 
“It’s all about how magical everyday life can be sometimes,” Juls said. “It’s kind of like a film camera where they capture that moment perfectly. That’s what I try to do with all of my work. Take one moment in time that feels like love and feels like the perfect shade of blue … That’s what I’m trying to encompass. That moment.”
The resulting songs exemplify a poetic essence similar to the music of Lana Del Rey while the poppy, melodic backings are reminiscent of early Taylor Swift — two artists Juls cites as her biggest inspirations.
Juls works on producing and promoting her music with her older sister Jacqueline, who works as Juls’ manager and goes by the name Jacqs. The partnership not only paves way for the spectacular duo name of “Jacqs and Juls” but also greatly contributes to the achievement of Juls’ musical aspirations. 
As siblings who grew up together, Jacqs said she has observed firsthand the ease with which songwriting has always come to Juls, and the hard work that has brought that talent to fruition. After years of songwriting in Juls’ bedroom and business classes, the two felt that they were meant to work together to get Juls’ music out into the world. 
“There’s always this little voice inside of you that kind of leads you where you’re meant to go,” Jacqs said. “We’ve always just been so tied to listening to our inner guidance, and there’s always been this pull towards working on music together.”
This intangible pull to collaborate and create has led the duo to expand Juls’ musical pursuits, taking their efforts into producing studios and onto the stage. The result has been positively reaffirming, according to listeners who have observed firsthand Juls’ songwriting skills and captivating stage presence. 
Jordan Jones, a junior majoring in biology, was working a shift at USC’s Ground Zero Performance Cafe when Juls performed at an open mic event. Impressed by how naturally Juls commanded the microphone, Jones congratulated her on her performance.
“I remember I saw her go up there and I was like, ‘This girl’s like a popstar,’” Jones said. “She had the voice, the look, the confidence.”
Following this encounter that feels pulled from a movie scene, Juls and Jones became friends and occasional music collaborators, allowing Jones to see the ease with which Juls applies her lyrical prowess to any given melody.
“I don’t think I’ve ever met someone as confident in their ability to write songs — and for good reason,” Jones said. “I was messing around with some chords on my guitar one da,y and she just started coming up with lyrics on the spot. I was like, ‘Yo, did you write that?’ And she was like, ‘I was just making it up as you were playing.’”
Juls puts words to the magical qualities of our everyday endeavors, developed through many years of practice.
“For her, writing has been something in her life since she was 12 or 13 years old, and her desire to do it and her passion for it hasn’t dwindled since,” Jacqs said. “Finding that purpose in your life or that thing that really ignites you and then working towards that is what we’re doing with music.”
Continuing to follow that purpose, Juls, who prepares to release her newest single “Summer Thing,” said she hopes it will fulfill its own purpose of starting the summer off with a bang.
“It’s something I would hear on the radio. I would be lying if I said she wasn’t sitting on a summer anthem,” Jones said. “I’m super excited for it to come out.”

When I was eight years old, I woke up begrudgingly to get ready to go to school and I immediately was lured to the kitchen by tantalizing smells in the air. Wide-eyed, I enthusiastically sprinted to the breakfast table, excited to find the source of the delicious aroma — a fluffy torta or egg and potato omelet made by my grandmother. I was in heaven, letting the delicious flavors dance on my tongue as I basked in the childlike wonder of falling in love with a new type of food. 
Years later, with this monumental morning nearly forgotten, I encountered the perfect Spanish version of this dish, tortilla de patatas, in the heart of Silverlake at Bar Moruno. Longtime veterans and collaborators David Rosoff and chef Chris Feldmeier opened Bar Moruno in Silverlake, with previous iterations at The Grove and Grand Central Market.  
Walking into Bar Moruno feels similar to walking into a modern bar in Madrid, with an espresso-stained bar top and tables decorated with a golden yellow wall in the front and dark olive green surrounding the inside of the restaurant. The decor echoes pieces of Spanish history, and a Chiquilin Paprika tin planted with a succulent accents each table. The focal point of the restaurant is its open kitchen with a wood-fired oven where many dishes are roasted.
There are a wide variety of beverages to choose from, hailing from Spain to Southwest France, a Spanish-style Gin & Tonic to classical Sherries from Jerez and Tempranillo from Rioja. With a full page of Gins on the menu, this is the perfect place to enjoy a classic Gin Martini. There were five types of each to choose from, such as the Strawberry Dandelion Gin Tonic or the Coconut Gin Martini. 
I opted for the Iberico Old Fashioned, which was made with Jamon Iberico washed Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Mezcal, Calvados and Moruno Spices. It was certainly a bespoke cocktail that was at another level of the classic old fashioned, with a complex combination of smoke, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg spices.
To start the meal, there is a selection of Minerva conservas — tuna, sardine or mackerel, served in tin cans — and bread options such as Pan con Tomate, made with grilled Jyan Isaac bread and cherry tomatoes. There is also a section of “Little Things,” consisting of small tapas such as anchovies, candied olives and almonds.  Naturally, my eyes gravitated towards the Tortilla Española, and it was perfectly cooked — a pillow of succulently whipped eggs and fluffy potatoes.
We continued on with a Baby Lettuce Salad, which was well balanced with the nice acid from the lemon vinaigrette, the creaminess of the feta and the crunch of the radishes and English peas. There were three other salads to choose from as well as roasted sweet potatoes, rice and lentils.
For the main course, we tried the Prime Ribeye medium rare — wood fire-roasted and accented with Maldon sea salt. There were only two other main courses to choose from, Oven Roasted Mussels or Orata, a whole sea bream. For dessert, we ended with the Basque cheesecake — surrounded by a passion fruit sauce whose tartness complemented the creaminess of the cheesecake.  
If you’re looking for a casual, yet special, evening out, you will find a little slice of Spanish heaven at Bar Moruno in Silverlake. Although I initially entered the restaurant solely looking to escape from my stress from impending exams with a nice meal, I left with a full stomach and a mind full of happy and nostalgic thoughts.

Sitting in their Game Design Workshop class in 2019,  Sheehan Ahmed and Weston Bell-Geddes were inspired to adapt their team’s board game, “SPOOKULELE,” into a fully developed video game. Last spring, the two successfully pitched this project to USC’s Advanced Games Program — the capstone program for USC games students — and are now in the process of completing a shortened version of the game. Ahmed, a junior majoring in interactive entertainment, serves as the creative director, with Bell-Geddes, a junior majoring in interactive entertainment serving as the game’s executive producer.
Starting out as a freshman year board game project built around a green ukulele, Ahmed and Bell-Geddes have since been inspired to rework the game into a haunted, action-adventure, single-player game to pitch for the Advanced Games program.
“[Game Design Workshop’s first assignment] is a very famous project for our major. It’s the first project you do as a Game Design major, and it’s just so funny, because now this is what we’re also ending our [college] lives with,” Bell-Geddes said.
Since pitching, the team has spent the last year crafting a fully playable 15-minute demo game. The process started with pre-production last summer, when Ahmed and Bell-Geddes found their team and planned out the plot and details of the game.
Over this period, Ahmed and Bell-Geddes recruited a large, diverse team of collaborators to work on their project. Eventually, they amassed a team of 49 people, which Bell-Geddes said brought along a good variety of input. 
“There’s volunteers that are mostly from USC but also from other universities such as Cal State Fullerton,” he said. “It’s very interdisciplinary … We have artists, designers, etc, and they all come from different majors around the University.”
Erica Wang, a junior majoring in interactive entertainment who serves as character art director, said working alongside Ahmed and Bell-Geddes has been exciting. Wang felt as though her contributions, as well as those of her teammates, were valued, and that Ahmed and Bell-Geddes created a dynamic work experience. 
“I think both [Bell-Geddes] and [Ahmed] are extremely skilled and passionate at what they do,” Wang said. “The team itself is really amazing too. There’s so much talent going around, and I think ‘SPOOKULELE’ in particular, it’s just a very tight-knit, close team.” 
The team created an action-adventure game set in haunted New Orleans, where a young girl named Haru and a reaper, Spooky, must fight off ghosts to save the world from an endless night. Players use either a sword or a magical ukulele, from which they can cast spells. Their goal is to progress through the city fighting various ghosts who become increasingly harder to defeat, before a final showdown with Diesel Knevil, an evil biker with a pumpkin head.
“There’s a point where the game really reveals its identity to you,” Ahmed said. “I was a little bit afraid at the beginning of the process that that moment would never come, and we would kind of just be making shots in the dark forever and we would never find out what SPOOKULELE was trying to be, but now knowing what it is feels really good.”
Designing this complex and unique game was no small feat, as the team entered the school year having to meet milestones, such as alpha, when all the features for the game had to be completed, and beta, when no new content may be added, set by a team of industry faculty, led by professors Danny Bilson, Tracy Fullerton and Jim Huntley. Gradually, the team also had to fully design and see out their game while making sure the gameplay was free of bugs and user-friendly, leading up to the fully playable demo, which will debut at the USC Games Expo May 12.
“Everything we’re doing now is just polishing, getting everything super, super good,” Bell-Geddes said. “Putting the trailer together, putting all the marketing material together, which is also eye-opening because we see how close the game is.”
Ahmed and Bell-Geddes have detailed plans to take “SPOOKULELE” even beyond the expo. Ahmed and Bell-Geddes also founded their own publishing company, Spookulele Games, where they have published some of their own games, as well as those of other students. After graduating, the duo hope to take this company further, and publish an expanded “SPOOKULELE” under their label.
“The dream is to walk into a Gamestop and see ‘SPOOKULELE’ lining the shelves,” Ahmed said. “Now that we have a demo that we know is like, ‘Oh, this is actually kind of fun,’ we want to take it and stretch it to a whole 10, 15-hour experience that people can buy and play.”
From the freshman year board game built out of a bright green ukulele to the fully playable demo, the two students are excited to see what the future holds for “SPOOKULELE.”
“I just think it’s so special that we started this game as freshmen in college and now it’s taken a whole different form and created a whole different life for us,” Bell-Geddes said. “I’m very excited to see where it goes and I’m extremely optimistic for the future of SPOOKULELE.”

I’m sitting down on my couch, enjoying a Trader Joe’s pizza and the NBA playoffs. 
Suddenly, Stephen Curry takes over my screen. That’s not necessarily an unexpected occurrence, as the NBA superstar is currently leading his Golden State Warriors to a spot in the second round. But this time it wasn’t about basketball. 
Instead, it was a commercial for FTX Crypto Derivatives Exchange. It wasn’t a bad commercial, as the bar is pretty low these days. It featured Lakers legend Shaquille O’Neal jokingly describing Curry as a “crypto expert,” to which Curry responded with a promotion for FTX’s app and the ease it brings users who want to trade cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ethereum. 
Cryptocurrency has become a divisive issue, with many rolling their eyes at the idea of “digital money” and others desperately dumping their rainy day funds into the next bitcoin. If you’re a Twitter user, chances are you have seen tweets about crypto from the richest person on the planet, Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO faced accusations of a Securities Exchange Act violation when he seemingly controlled the price of dogecoin with any given tweet. 
Crypto certainly has raised some interesting questions about government-regulated currencies versus decentralized banking systems, but here’s at least one certified problem with the concept: it’s terrible for the environment. 
Digital currencies are decentralized systems that record transactions in a distributing ledger called a blockchain. To mine bitcoin or other cryptos, users must validate transactions made with the currency by solving a complex math problem. This transaction, called a proof of work mechanism, will award whoever solves the problem first with a fixed amount of cryptocurrency. Read that again. 
Or don’t, it doesn’t really matter. Basically, to solve these problems, users run programs on their computers. To power a computer to run these programs, energy must be used. Users have a better chance at updating the blockchain and mining bitcoin with more powerful computers, which unsurprisingly requires more energy. 
Mining cryptocurrency dumps carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The energy consumption used to mine bitcoin alone surpassed the amount of energy used in Norway in 2020. United States bitcoin mining produced nearly 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide in 2020. For reference, Exxon Mobil reported a carbon footprint of 650 million tons of carbon dioxide that same year. 
As a society that is, or at least should be, seeking ways to reduce our carbon footprint, cryptocurrency seems like an unnecessary increase in carbon emissions. 
So back to the commercial. I like Steph Curry. I think he is one of the best players to touch a basketball and seems like a good guy. But his endorsement of crypto is a little annoying, not only because of the environmental impacts but fiscally as well. 
Cryptocurrency is a wealthy person’s game. Just 0.01% of bitcoin holders own 27% of the entire digital currency. Wealthy individuals have dumped money into cryptocurrencies in hopes that they can grow their wealth as the world catches on. 
But why do we need to be on board in the first place? It’s harmful to the environment and essentially exists as a security blanket for millionaires. 
So to Steph Curry, you can boost your crypto apps, but I might start channeling my 2016 anti-Warriors energy that led to the infamous 3-1 blown lead to LeBron James, who I’m sure is not invested in crypto. 
Just kidding. Of course he is.

The NBA playoffs are well underway and have already given fans intense matchups in both conferences. With the objective of winning a championship in mind, former Trojans have either pitched in superstar performances or efficient contributions to win pivotal games and give their team a chance at advancing to the second round. 
Guard DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls
The Chicago Bulls entered the opening round of the NBA playoffs as an underdog to the reigning champions, the Milwaukee Bucks. The Bulls’ leading scorer, DeMar DeRozan, has posted inconsistent numbers as of late, and the Bucks have taken a 3-1 lead. 
In the first four games of the series, DeRozan has averaged 23.3 points, 6.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 1.5 steals on 40% shooting from the field. In the Game 2 victory that temporarily tied the series, DeRozan dropped 41 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 blocks on 51.6% shooting from the field, making 16 of his 31 shots. 
The Bulls are still fighting for passage to the second round of the postseason, and key performances from DeRozan are critical to overcome the 3-1 deficit. DeRozan averaged 31.3 points, 4 rebounds and 4 assists on 47.4% shooting against the Bucks during the regular season, proving that he is capable of performing against the reigning champions.  
Guard Jordan McLaughlin, Minnesota Timberwolves
The No. 7 seed Minnesota Timberwolves have surprised pundits and fans with their performances against the No. 2 seed Memphis Grizzlies, who are spearheaded by star point guard and 2022 NBA Most Improved Player, Ja Morant. The Timberwolves are still behind 2-3 heading into Game 6, but the series has been competitive despite Minnesota winning 10 fewer games during the regular season. 
Third-year point guard Jordan McLaughlin received an increase in minutes during Game 4 and didn’t disappoint. In only 14 minutes of play, McLaughlin provided 16 points, 2 assists and 2 steals while converting all his 4 attempts from beyond the arc. McLaughlin’s gritty performance off the bench propelled the Timberwolves to a narrow 119-118 home victory over Memphis. 
McLaughlin received limited playing time during the regular season, averaging only 14.5 minutes off the bench. McLaughlin’s efficient showing in Game 4 provides Minnesota another layer of depth during this year’s playoffs as the former Trojan looks to prove his worth for an increase in playing time in the future. 
Center Onyeka Okongwu, Atlanta Hawks
The Atlanta Hawks qualified as the East Conference’s No. 8 seed after defeating the Charlotte Hornets and Cleveland Cavaliers in the play-in tournament. Despite stealing one game, the Hawks fell against the conference leaders in Miami Heat in five games. 
Second-year center Onyeka Okongwu served as a backup big man to Clint Capela during the regular season, averaging 20 minutes per game. Okongwu averaged 21.6 minutes per game and contributed as a role player. In the crucial Game 3 that landed Atlanta their first and sole win of the series, Okongwu notched 9 points, 6 rebounds, 1 steal and 2 critical blocks in 24 minutes of play. 
Although the Hawks have placed faith in veteran Capela, Okongwu has proved to be a reliable role player off the bench. 
Center Dewayne Dedmon, Miami Heat
On the other side of the first-round matchup, the Eastern Conference regular-season winners Miami Heat have clinched a 4-1 win over the Hawks. The Heat have operated with a relatively small-ball roster, with their frontcourt made up of a 6-foot-5 PJ Tucker at power forward and 6-foot-9 Bam Adebayo at center. 
Nine-year veteran Dewayne Dedmon provides versatility off the bench, with his 7-foot frame and 40.4% shooting from beyond the arc during the regular season. The former Trojan contributes depth to Head Coach Eric Spoelstra’s Miami team. 
In five games of play against the Hawks, Dedmon averaged 4.2 points and 3.6 rebounds on 56.3% shooting from the field in only 9.4 minutes per game. In Miami’s home victory in Game 2, Dedmon’s 9 rebounds led the Heat, and he added to his 6 points in only 13 minutes of play. 
With the Heat looking to reach the NBA Finals again after losing out in 2020, bench efficiency from the likes of Dedmon will be vital to their chances.
