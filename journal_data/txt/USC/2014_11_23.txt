The Center for Women and Men held a open house at their new location in the Engemann Student Health Center on Friday. The Center was previously located in the Student Union but moved to the third floor of Engemann this October. According to Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, plans for the move began last year after funding was secured. Construction took place over this past summer in the previously empty space in Engemann, which itself has only been in operation since spring of 2013.

Ekta Kumar, who previously worked at the Loyola University Maryland counseling center, was named director of the Center. Kumar started her position in late July of this year. In addition to her administrative duties as director, Kumar also counsels students herself and takes them to appointments and Title IX meetings.
“My role as director is to provide a vision for the Center and to make sure we have good relationships with our students and staff, and help with programming and prevention,” Kumar said.
Kumar said the new location is meant to improve the communication with students about the resources that are available on campus.
“My hope is to get students to know more about our services. So they know that if they need to go to the hospital, they have someone who can go with them,” she said.
According to Kumar, the Center has been seeing clients for about three weeks since it moved.
“We were literally closed for three days to unpack and pack. We’ve been seeing clients since then, “ she said.
The open house event catered lunch in the conference room, handed out shirts that read “Keep Calm and Get Consent” on the front and “USC Men Care” on the back and gave attendees the chance to write encouraging messages on a white board and pose for photos. The office features five therapy rooms, the conference room to hold group therapy sessions and a full waiting room. The open house was attended by students, faculty and staff from different departments and floors.
Nadja Barlera, an undecided sophomore, attended the open house event. Barlera, who found out about the event through Facebook, believes the new Center is a great improvement over the former location. As a volunteer for Visions and Voices, Barlera had visited the old location to disperse fliers. She described the old office as cramped; she remembered it as mostly being one big room that was broken off into smaller partitions with plastic walls, like cubicles. The open house event was the first time Barlera had seen the new office.
“I think it’s cool to just have a space for people to hang out in this little reception area,” Barlera said. “We didn’t have that before. So now people can just come in here and talk. It’s also easier for the people who work here to do their jobs.”
Barlera said she thought it was a good idea to place the new office in Engemann due to its proximity to other health-related services.
“It seems like it’s good that it’s near the other counseling centers. General student counseling is right across the hall,“ she said.
Lynette Merriman, assistant provost for student affairs, also commended the convenience of the Center’s new location, which she believes will foster collaboration between different student support programs in terms of outreach partnerships and joint reporting. She mentioned that the full potential of the Center has yet to be realized.
“There currently are two vacant positions, and we are looking for highly qualified staff,“ Merriman said.
Merriman said that the office hires students as social work interns.
The Center for Women and Men is currently accepting appointments made over the phone. According to Kumar, the Center will eventually offer walk-in hours once there is a full staff established.

The Master of Public Diplomacy program at USC, in collaboration with the School of International Relations, coordinated the symposium “On the Right Side of History: Public Diplomacy & LGBT Rights Today.”The one-day event was organized by the Jocelyn Coffin, editor in chief of Public Diplomacy Magazine, Maria Portela, marketing editor of the magazine and Nicholas Cull, professor of public diplomacy and director of the master’s program in public diplomacy. The event was the magazine’s first-ever symposium at USC, centering on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, and serves as a preamble to the Winter 2015 issue of Public Diplomacy Magazine.
The event met the magazine’s mission as stated on its website: to provide a common forum for the views of both scholars and practitioners from around the globe, in order to explore key concepts in the study and practice of public diplomacy.
A brainstorming session resulted in the creation of the event.
Speeches at the event covered a wide variety of LGBT political concerns, ranging from historical beliefs to a session on a gay diplomat’s experiences abroad. The keynote speaker was David Huebner, former United States Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa.
PD Magazine includes different topics, case studies and interviews in each issue. Though the winter edition of 2014 was on gastrodiplomacy, and the summer 2014 issue on non-state actors, the next issue planned will cover topics surrounding LGBT rights. Focused not only on the momentous progress of the LGBT movement, but also the challenges for public diplomacy efforts in environments that are hostile to LGBT individuals, the goal of this issue is to provide a forum for meaningful discussion of LGBT rights.
At the event, Laura Belmonte, department head and professor of history at Oklahoma State University, highlighted LGBT issues in history, and the steps taken to solve them. James Pamment, assistant professor of media and communication studies at Karlstad University, spoke about the need to improve conditions for the LGBT community and consider LGBT as a research topic.
Former Consul General of the U.S. Consulate General at Osaka-Japan Patrick Linehan, shared his personal experiences and struggles as a gay man in the diplomatic world. The session was titled ‘The Life of a Gay Diplomat.’ He started his speech by reading an excerpt from a book he and his husband wrote that depicted their life as a gay diplomatic couple abroad, and gave valuable insight into how the LGBT community was treated in Japan in the late ’80s.
“Different countries hated my husband and me for several reasons, but we had to fight for our own rights,” Linehan said during at the event.
Linehan emphasized that the situation has improved over the years, but there were issues and problems still happening in the early 2000s. He proposed a mantra: “Be visible.”
“Be visible, and realize the power of visibility and believing in yourself,” Linehan said.

The crosstown rivalry took on another dimension last week as USC’s Environmental Student Assembly competed with UCLA to see who could rack up the most pledges to conserve water. The campaign took place through Change the Course, an organization that aims to encourage water conservation and put water back into the Colorado River.
“People pledge, by texting or online, that they will reduce water themselves and that they want it to happen on a much wider scale,” said Kyleen Marcella, ESA co-assistant director. “We thought this would be an excellent way to use the rivalry between the two schools to support a good cause and help spread awareness of the importance of water conservation.”
To take the pledge in support of the USC side, supporters could text “TROJANS” to 77177, and 1,000 more gallons of water would be added to the river.
ESA has done similar work previously, including a photo campaign to lessen environmental impact and a video competition to promote sustainability. The group began their efforts last spring, and this year, they wanted to get involved with rivalry week.
“We have been in talks with UCLA about a competition during rivalry week since the summer, but we finally decided we wanted to specifically address the drought once school started,” Marcella said. “Ultimately, we advocate for environmental issues on campus and support greater environmental education, and this campaign ties in perfectly with our mission.”
Members of ESA have spoken with several students concerned about the drought, and they see this competition as an accessible way for them to become environmentally involved and to spread awareness. They also hoped to show students that large organizations such as Coca-Cola and Disney support water conservation.
“Because USC and UCLA are two huge centers of Los Angeles, our water consumption is a huge part of L.A.’s overall water consumption,” said Shawn Rhoads, ESA executive director. “It’s important that we as two universities come together and recognize this.”
To encourage students to take the pledge, ESA created a Facebook event page advertising the competition. About 300 people texted for Team USC.
“It’s such a small gesture, and it’s so easy, requiring very little work but still having a big impact,” said Sarah Nuslein, a junior majoring in business administration. “I did it initially for the rivalry component, but after I thought about all the good it would do regarding the Colorado River, it seemed like a no brainer.”
So far, more than 91,000 pledges have been made for the overall campaign, equaling more than 91 million gallons of water. As for the rivalry competition, UCLA had made over 400 more pledges than USC as of press time. The competition closed on Sunday, Nov. 23 at 11:59 p.m., and the winner was to be announced shortly afterward.
Rhoads stressed that no matter what the outcome, actions such as this can make change. “Everyone taking the pledge to reduce water consumption can make a significant difference.”

The USC men’s basketball team fell 63-61 to Penn State on Sunday afternoon, capping a less-than-impressive showing at the Charleston Classic. The Trojans (2-3) entered the tournament with high hopes but were only able to win one game out of three.
Ballin’ · Sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt led USC with 14 points on Sunday afternoon. Reinhardt is averaging 10.8 points per game this year. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
 
In the first round, an experienced Akron team outmatched USC, winning by a 66-46 score. The Zips are the only Mid-American Conference team to win 20 games in each season for the past nine seasons. Despite holding Akron to 40 percent shooting, the Trojans struggled to take care of the ball, turning it over 16 times.
After trailing by as much 17 points, the Trojans went on a quick 10-0 run midway through the second half to cut the lead to single digits before Antino Jackson hit two 3-pointers to put Akron up for good. The Trojans would ultimately fall by 20, while having their worst shooting performance in two seasons at 28 percent.
The Trojans seemed to come together in their second game of the tournament as they rallied from a double-digit first half deficit to defeat the Drexel Dragons 72-70. Led by towering redshirt sophomore forward Darion Clark’s five points and seven rebounds, as well as smothering team defense, the Trojans outscored the Dragons 44-30 in the second half.
“We knew what we were capable of,” Clark said. “We just had to be energetic and keep our composure.”
After a horrible shooting performance the previous day, the Trojan’s offense bounced back. Freshman guard Jordan McLaughlin contributed 11 points, including two three-pointers, eight assists and four steals after having the roughest game of his young career against Akron. Sophomore guard Julian Jacobs contributed 12 points, all in the second half, to go along with three steals. Head coach Andy Enfield was proud of his young team’s turnaround.
“We just have to perform offensively. Players have to make plays. They’ve got to take care of the ball,” Enfield said. “Today was different.”
With such a young team, growing pains were to be expected. After almost blowing a three-point lead with 30 seconds to go against Drexel, the Trojans squandered away a second-half lead to the Penn State Nittany Lions in their final game of the tournament, ultimately losing 63-61.
The Trojans struggled to take care of the ball, a common theme in this short season, and turned the ball over 13 times, including a key turnover by struggling sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic in the final minutes that sparked a 6-0 run by the Lions that permanently gave them the lead.
Despite shooting a mere 27 percent from the field, the Trojans were able to stay competitive in the game through their defense. McLaughlin led the team with three steals as the Trojans forced Penn State to turn the ball over 15 times.
A lack of senior leadership and experienced players really showed itself, however, as the Trojans struggled to shoot the ball once again. Enfield knows the team can’t afford to miss open shots against quality teams.
“You shoot 28 percent on lane shots, it’s not too good,” Enfield said. “Our guards had open shots. We just missed them.”
The Trojans can hold their head high after turning things around following their 20-point loss to Akron. With each coming game, this young team continues to make strides. Hopefully, by the time the Pac-12 season comes around this team will be playing at the level that Enfield expects out of them.
USC fields the youngest team in the Pac-12 and the inexperienced team should continue to grow throughout the season. There have been flashes of greatness that Enfield envisioned when putting this team together, but the Trojans have failed to put forth a complete 40-minute effort.
The Trojans will have a chance to build off their tournament experience on Tuesday night when they face Cal State Fullerton at the Galen Center. Tip-off is set for 8 p.m. PST.
The team then has five days rest before a Nov. 30 road battle against New Mexico.

For the first time in my life on Saturday night, I lost faith in USC football. It happened with 14 seconds left in the first half, when UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley threw yet another wide open touchdown pass to receiver Eldridge Massington. For years, I have grown up with a steadfast belief in USC’s ability to make second-half adjustments, to come out of the locker roaring with vengeance, and to come back and win in the final 30 minutes.
Seven-win Sark · Head coach Steve Sarkisian fell to 7-4 in his first season at Troy with Saturday’s loss against UCLA. Sarkisian won seven games in three of his five seasons as the head coach at Washington. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
I grew up believing that USC was never out of a game. No matter how great the deficit was, no matter how dim the outlook was, the USC football team had the innate spirit and drive to come out victorious against all odds. As a fan this conviction was shaped early on in the Pete Carroll era: even when USC was down 21-3 to Arizona State at halftime, even when they were down to a lowly Stanford team at half, even when they were struggling with Dennis Dixon and Oregon, the outcome was never really in doubt. USC would find a way to win.
On Saturday that faith crumbled quicker than the USC secondary. For the first time in my rooting career, I did not honestly believe that USC would come back to win in the second half. It was torture, sitting there without the slightest bit of hope that the Trojan coaching staff could rally their troops. With 14 seconds left in the second quarter, I accepted the notion that USC would allow the Bruins to continue their lease on the city for another dreary year.
As one of the most optimistic fans around — prior to Saturday I thought USC could hang with Alabama — halftime was a torturous affair. What was exponentially worse, however, was watching the first five minutes of the second half confirm the fear that USC football has fallen right off that cliff.
That’s the problem though. By comparing USC to the standards Pete Carroll set, USC is holding itself back. Trying to recreate the magic by hiring his former assistants is not working. Much like the Bill Belichick coaching tree, Carroll’s assistants haven’t been as successful because they just aren’t him. If yesterday was any indication, Sarkisian and Co.’s ability to motivate players for big games and make second-half adjustments stood somewhere between slim and none.
By living in the past both as fans and a program, we are hampering the future of the Trojan football program. College football has evolved in the past 10 years; USC needs to as well. I’m not sure if that means bringing in a guy like Will Muschamp to run the defense or having an offensive coordinator call the plays. Something needs to change.
If you take away the cupcake games — Cal, Washington State, Colorado and Fresno State — and focus on the games of quality, it is not a pretty picture. The Trojans are 3-4. The offense is middling in mediocrity, failing to utilize the vast arsenal of weapons at their disposal. The “bend but don’t break” breaks like a sieve either against the pass, the run or both once the fourth quarter hits. The record could be much worse if Arizona’s kicker hits a chip shot, or if David Shaw learns about this thing called the forward pass. USC could have easily been 1-6 in these games.
The season that was built on smoke and mirrors has been revealed for what it truly has been, a year of pretending. Saturday was a night of reckoning that one can only hope will reverberate around the entire program. All the issues that the team has been skating by with were revealed against the Bruins.
The Trojan’s hurry-up offense again tired out the thin, beleaguered defense. I understand wanting to implement one’s scheme for the future, but that needs to be balanced out against giving your current team the best chance to win. Great coaches adjust to their players. Good coaches simply try to adjust their players to their scheme.
The obsession with getting cute on third and fourth downs and trying to outsmart the other team instead of imposing one’s will killed the Trojans on Saturday. It seems like the only time the fullback gets involved this season is on third down, when the play call is to run it unsuccessfully up the middle or throw it eight yards down the field to no avail.
The team got overly aggressive at unnecessary times almost as if to futilely run daring plays to spite the critics who say the team is too conservative. Whether it was the fourth-and-2 or calling long developing routes, this unwarranted and reckless aggression cost the team mightily. If a team is blitzing as aggressively as UCLA was, it would seem prudent to call a few more middle screens and draws to counteract their swarming defense.
On defense, the Trojans stopped blitzing after the first quarter. They had decent success against the Bruins through the first six drives. Take away the two blown coverages, and USC’s assortment of blitzes actually stymied the Bruins on three drives. It’s no coincidence that what might have been Kevon Seymour’s first corner blitz of his career, resulted in a flustered Hundley throwing a pick six.
The moment when USC went conservative and started to treat Hundley like he had a yellow jersey on was when the Trojan’s defense faltered. For three years now, USC has made Hundley look like an All-American when he simply is not. Don’t let the beatdown fool you. UCLA really is not that good. Their performance Saturday was a byproduct of poor preparation and coaching by the Trojans. If Stanford doesn’t beat them, Oregon will decimate the Bruins.
Admittedly, it’s easy to sit back and criticize decisions of X’s and O’s after the game. I’ll be the first to say that I don’t have enough knowledge of the intricacies of the game. The flaws I pointed out were very surface-level, however, and readily apparent to anyone watching the game.
What should be criticized more extensively is the lack of fire and intensity the Trojans had coming out of the locker room after halftime. To not make adjustments nor motivate your team in a rivalry game is befuddling to me as a fan. That has nothing to do with depth and sanctions; that is just Football 101.
Sarkisian admitted that coaching must get better after the game. While I respect him owning up to his mistakes, at a certain point saying “we will get better” gets old if the product on the field remains the same. Talk is cheap, actions are what counts. As the old adage goes, game tape never lies.
As a fan, I can only hope that Saturday was a wakeup call for the Trojan program. I hope that out of the depths of despair, USC can rise as a football team to the level of greatness it was once accustomed to maintaining. I hope that when we console ourselves as fans and say we will get them next year, USC does actually beat UCLA in 2015. I hope for a program with fight and determination and passion. I hope that our faith will be restored.

You had me till you said Ucla isn’t that good.  They were very good in all phases of the game. Dominated both lines and toyed with our secondary.  Calling them not that good doesn’t make it true. We need to acknowledge the truth. 
Good write up David, but hoping something changes is a pipe dream. Pat Haden hired Sark and Sark will remain. Darks a good, honest and decent coach, but he is not a tier 1 head coach for a program such as usc. Haden had McAfee it clear that he is not as convened about hiring the best coach, but hiring someone who knows what usc is about. Haden cares more foe women’s sports than anything else. 
No one on our team took this rivalry game serially last week. I’ll prepared coaching and game plans, players making mistakes they shouldn’t and not one player for in the face of the ucla kid who stood in the middle of the field before the band matched on to it. No one got interested gave of the 4 guys running down the SC sideline. We have the Beings ask they needed to be emotionally prepared for this game. We played like bruins and they played like sc.period.
They own this town right now. Mora is their Pete Carroll and it shows.
I pray you are wrong. Sark simply cannot coach a program beyond the caliber of say San Diego State. If Hayden won’t pull the trigger then alumni should rise up. Yes dumping Sark after one year would create loads of horrible press. so what. It will pass.  – and if USC waits 2 more seasons to ditch Sark USC will be looking at a decade of fighting WSU for the cellar. 5 and 4 star recruits won’t show up to a program in which the coaching staff wastes their talent.

The Victory Bell rang loud and often on Saturday night, as USC lost its third straight game to the crosstown rival UCLA Bruins and ended its Pac-12 title aspirations this season.
Losing control · Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler and the Trojans fell to UCLA for the third straight time on Saturday night. Kessler went 22-of-34 for 214 yards and one touchdown in a losing effort. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Bruins (9-2, 6-2 Pac-12) sacked redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler six times en route to their 38-20 win over the Trojans (7-4, 6-3) at the Rose Bowl. USC’s young offensive linemen appeared completely incapable of protecting Kessler, who finished the game with 214 yards and one touchdown and one interception.
“It’s hard to get through progressions when guys are in the backfield,” Kessler said. “I tried to make some plays on the run and make some stuff happen, but they did a good job all around.”
While Kessler and the Trojans struggled with execution, UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley threw for 326 yards and three touchdowns and became UCLA’s all-time leader in total offense.
Hundley made one early mistake but ran the offense efficiently from there on out. On UCLA’s second offensive play of the game, Hundley forced a pass into tight coverage, and USC redshirt junior linebacker Anthony Sarao picked it off and ran in back for a 17-yard touchdown to give USC its only lead of the game.
After stalling on the ensuing drive, UCLA punted to junior wideout Agholor, who fumbled the ball and allowed the Bruins to take over on the 8-yard line. UCLA made good on its nation’s-best 97.4 percent conversion rate in the red zone, and evened the score at 7-7. Agholor’s mistake shifted the momentum back toward the Bruins, and they never looked back.
Agholor, who was recently named a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award, severely disappointed after posting two straight games with more than 200 receiving yards. The Tampa, Florida, native dropped one potential touchdown and finished the game with just 24 yards on three catches.
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian noted that the offense couldn’t execute when Kessler forced it to Agholor.
“Sometimes when you throw the ball so much to one guy — not necessarily out of design, but that’s what happened the last couple weeks — you can potentially fall into a little trap of, ‘That’s where it should always go,’” Sarkisian said. “We’ve got other really good players. We’re at our best when the ball is getting deployed to a variety of people.”
The Trojans went into halftime down 24-14 following a touchdown reception by sophomore tailback Justin Davis and three Hundley touchdowns to Devin Lucien, Thomas Duarte and Eldridge Massington, but the floodgates opened as soon as the second half began. The Bruins drove 84 yards down the field, capped off by a 10-yard touchdown run by Paul Perkins, who surpassed USC redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen for the most rushing yards in the Pac-12.
Allen, who averaged 118.4 yards per game coming into the matchup, finished with just 60 yards behind the shaky offensive line.
Redshirt sophomore offensive lineman Zach Banner, who started at right tackle, felt his individual effort could have changed the course of the game.
“I feel like I let my team down,” Banner said. “But, like Coach [Sarkisian] said, people make mistakes. Everybody’s gonna have mistakes. I just expect myself to be perfect.”
The Trojans were far from perfect, though, converting just eight of 17 attempts on third down. UCLA wasn’t much better on third down, going just nine-for-16, but still looked dominant on both sides of the ball. Hundley, who has been hailed for his dual-threat capabilities, scampered into the end zone midway through the third quarter to give UCLA its biggest lead of the game, at 38-14.
Despite being down by 24, Sarkisian said his team never let up.
“I will say this: I am proud of our guys — their effort, their willingness to compete late in the game and battle,” Sarkisian said. “They came right together as a team, which is a hard thing to do through disappointment, through adversity, but again, I’ve been praising these guys for that all along.”
The Trojans demonstrated their resolve late in the game by stringing together their longest drive: a 15-play, 91-yard sequence that resulted in an Allen rushing touchdown. But it was a thankless score, as a failed two-point conversion made it an 18-point game.
Though it was a crushing defeat for the Trojans, Sarkisian insists the team will bounce back for its final home game of the season.
“We’re not dead,” Sarkisian said. “We lost a football game.”
IT IS TRUE ,no one died individually,the team and the program may need some sort of life saving injection;hope they find some desire to practice and play harder for ND…they are no patsy…Louisville barely won;they are an extremely physical team.

Mental illness is an issue that is often misunderstood. But Tyler Matheson, a freshman business administration major, and a group of other students are working hard to change that.
Team effort · Members of Safe not SCared, from left to right: Bianca Nasser, Tyler Matheson and Jen Pongsai, came together after noticing a lack of satisfactory help available to students suffering from mental illness. – Photo courtesy of Tyler Matheson
These students initiated Safe Not SCared, a campaign that aims to empower students suffering from mental illness and give them a voice in a culture that neglects their silence.
“I’ve had a long history of mental illness, and I know that if some people like me came here, they wouldn’t like the university’s culture,” Matheson said. “I feel that USC has a responsibility and an obligation to provide for those afflicted with mental illness. We’ve been ignored for a long time, and if there’s a time for that to change, it’s right now.”
Safe Not SCared, set to launch in January 2015, is a Design for America project aimed at using public art as a means to start conversations and offer new perspectives on the issue of mental health. The group is planning to create several types of artistic media that address psychological problems.
“We’re going to start with something stationary that people can look at,” Matheson said. “We figured that engagement is our best option so right now we have a polling station. From the results, we’ll create a mental health profile of USC on a big wall.”
The campaign will also maintain an online presence on social media in order to make content engaging for its audiences.
“What we want to do is create a splash board that acts as a social media aggregator,” Matheson said. “We’ll have a Safe Not SCared hashtag, and it will display all our content. We’ll also feature some documentary-like vignettes of us talking to people, asking them what it’s like to have mental illness and how the culture of USC has affected them. We want to use this page to pitch our ideas to the administration as well.”
Safe Not SCared is also planning to establish peer support groups to create a caring community for people suffering from mental illness. It already has strong backing from the Panhellenic Council and hopes to also address mental health issues in the Greek community.
At their essence, all of Safe Not SCared’s programs are focused on one goal: changing the way mental illness is perceived on campus.
“It’s viewed as a flaw in somebody,” Matheson said. “It’s kept under the table as much as possible, and you have a lot of victims who feel ashamed that they have it and don’t want to bring it out and talk about it at all.”
Matheson believes that the stigma surrounding mental illness causes students to avoid treatment. Based on his experience, Matheson considers that the services offered by USC aren’t aimed at those with deep psychological issues.
Ultimately, Matheson hopes the university can take a stronger approach toward providing effective mental health services to students in need, especially when, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, one in four students suffer from a form of mental illness on college campuses.
“We definitely want a revamping of their treatment style in order to help that minority who do not necessarily respond to the short-term counseling that Engemann [Student Health Center] has right now.”
Though Matheson is optimistic about the campaign’s future, he and his team recognize that they will need to overcome significant obstacles along the way.
“The biggest obstacle that I foresee is apathy from USC students,” Matheson said. “The reason for that is that we’re fighting against the culture of shame and neglect. The biggest fear I have is that we’re not going to get enough participation. Everybody knows someone who has suffered from mental illness, so we hope that drives people to take the first step.”
Matheson and his team want their campaign to prompt people in need to seek help. Only then will they consider Safe Not SCared to be a success.
“When it comes down to it, what we characterize as a success is at least one person showing up to a peer support group,” Matheson said. “If we can change the mind of one person to seek help, that is a success for us. The culture of shame makes resources at the Health Center invisible. It takes a lot to ask for help.”
Students who wish to learn more about Safe Not SCared can contact Matheson and his team via the USC Design for America Facebook page.

The general public might not know him yet, but by the end of Pierre Huyghe’s show at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, his name will be on everyone’s lips. Paris-native Huyghe has been on the contemporary art scene for a while, but this is his first retrospective in the United States and his first show in Los Angeles. This exhibit, at LACMA from Nov. 23 to Feb. 22, makes little tweaks and follows his retrospectives in the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and the Museum Ludwig, Köln.
Strange days · One of the many bizarre exhibits on display at the LACMA’s impressive Pierre Huyghe restrospective is the short film “Untitled (Human mask).” In the film, a monkey is dressed up as a young girl and it proceeds to play in different chambers in a series of irregular film loops. – Photo courtesy of LACMA
A retrospective is a compilation showing the development of an artist’s work over a period of time that implies reflection on a past creation. This show, however, is anything but static. Using a diverse array of media, from film to music, Huyghe creates evolving art organisms. Jarrett Gregory, who curated the exhibit has said that Huyghe’s work “lives on beyond his supervision.”
When you enter the exhibit, a uniformed man will shout your name to a cold, jagged space. He lets it echo in the darkness, intermingling with the scent of “Paris, 1738” (2014). Beyond you, there is a murky tank of squirming seafood, a pair of golden shoes called “Singing in the Rain,” (1996)  and a super-8mm Japanese video that awaits. Perhaps you will run into “Human” (2012), a white Ibizan hound with one shocking pink leg, or his compatriot, “Player” (2010), an actor dressed in a mask made of LED lights, evocative of another sculpture in the exhibition.
Like “Human,” the spectator is allowed to roam free. There is no introductory blurb and no specified path to take. Freed by a lack of knowledge, Huyghe requires his spectators to take an exhilarating leap of faith. Even though it’s Huyghe’s name on the exhibit, it’s the audience’s world. Though Huyghe doesn’t completely efface himself, he is conscious that his art exists apart from him, making exhibit ideal for collaboration and exploration.
Though large “Do Not Touch” signs often grace museum walls, giving visitors the notion that “art” has only one method of appreciation, this place has different rules. The audience is invited to touch and to change. In one instance, when spectators entered a large black room with a mysterious box of smoke and colorful lights, they stood there for 10 minutes before trying to approach the box. In the shadowy center of the exhibit, there is lighted pad on the ceiling. The lighting sequence is programmed to the weather conditions at Giverny from 1914 and 1918, when Monet painted the “Nymphéas,” and it overlooks a tank of “biotopes” from Monet’s Giverny gardens. There are switches for the audience to change the sequence of lights, however.
At the very back of the exhibition hall are glass windows that lead into the L.A. sunshine. Outside you will find artificial rain, snow and fog beside a sculpture with a beehive for a head. The bees are of a different breed than the ones used in the European retrospective explained the beekeepers, and as the bees adjust to their new home they will act differently. The head of the sculpture will also become larger as the bees build up.
One would have to spend hours, maybe even longer in this strange and different space to see everything. Videos such as Pierre Huyghe’s film “Untitled (Human mask),” featuring a monkey dressed as a little girl, play in the different chambers in indeterminate loops. What you see in these videos may appear in the flesh, such as “Human.” The submerged rocks, the aquariums and the beehive will grow, making the exhibit change at every moment. After the audience leaves, the bees will adapt to their new home, as will “Human.” Life goes on even when the spectators are not there, which may be Huyghe’s real message.

On Nov. 21, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 was released in the United States. The penultimate installment of this massive franchise follows protagonist Katniss and her comrades as they rebel against the oppressive government they have lived under all their lives. Though the storyline might be fictional, its lessons overlap with real world occurrences.
In an instance of life imitating art, five students in Thailand were detained last Thursday for their opposition to the military coup staged in May. According to Time magazine, the students wore T-shirts that proclaimed, “We don’t want the coup.” They proceeded to throw the three-finger salute used as a form of subversion in The Hunger Games. Because they challenged the government’s power, the five were arrested. Subsequently, the new Hunger Games film was pulled from one of Thailand’s biggest movie theater chains, Apex Cinemas. A spokesman for the chain said that the company “[felt] our theaters were being used for political movements.” In contrast, the fact that theaters are thwarting the movie’s release amplifies its placement in this grand political movement. Apex, in a manner similar to the government, denies the people of what they need most during a time of adversity — hope.
The three-finger salute is one of my favorite parts of The Hunger Games trilogy. It’s supposed to be a sign of gratitude or respect, but it’s also linked to saying farewell to someone beloved. People flash the gesture when Katniss volunteers to take her younger sister’s place in the games in the first book. In a beautiful scene in which she mourns the death of her friend, Rue, Katniss presses her fingers to her lips and waves them for the cameras. As the other districts caught on, the act is interpreted as a sign of defiance, and can result in being beaten and killed.
The Thai government’s actions parallel the brutality portrayed in the film and book series. Instead of actually understanding the true meaning behind a symbol of great pride for people in the community, officials have hyperbolically misconstrued it as an act that will tear their government apart. Yes, the students used the symbol as a criticism toward the coup, but more importantly, it is presented as an act of solidarity for the five. The symbol predominantly represents the respect the students have for their cause. The government has overreacted by arresting the students for an innocuous gesture.
And that’s where the movie theater chains figure in. These movie theaters are condoning the “Big Brother” actions of the government. The youths were thrown into jail and released later in the day, because they needed an “attitude adjustment,” as a security official said, according to the Daily Beast. Movie theaters serve one purpose, and that is to transport audiences from this world into the cinematic world, to space, to somewhere in the desert or, in this case, the Hunger Games arenas. They should not, however, curate their movie titles based on the reaction five students have provoked simply with an index, middle and ring finger in the air.
Ultimately though, the chain of events in Thailand represents the power of media. Though The Hunger Games trilogy might seem more like a juicy airplane read than an agent with the power to change the world, we have to pay more attention to the messages of the movies and books. Huge franchises that populate the market are now more relevant than ever, so readers must pose the same questions as the protagonists. In the current climate of political disarray, to remain unified, there must be a shared vision. District 12, one of the 13 districts in the dystopian nation of Panem in The Hunger Games, provided the students with that, yet the government and the theater chain have yanked that hope away.
These very brave students who are standing up for what they believe in deserve defense. And to help protect their vision of a world free from oppression, we should all gladly volunteer as tribute.

For the first time in 13 years, USC has lost its title to NYU as the lead university with the most international students, according to the Institute of International Education’s 2014 Open Door report released last Monday. The news of a falter in the longstanding tradition of inclusivity should spark conversations about diversity on campus, especially with regard to the school’s curriculum.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
Few USC classes, for both the General Education Program and major courseworks, fulfill the diversity requirement. The bigger issue, however, is that even the courses that do fulfill the requirement do not fully promote inclusive diversity — for Asian cultures, in particular.
For example, of the 16 courses offered for GE Category I (Western Cultures and Traditions) credit in Spring 2015, only two qualify for the diversity requirement. One of these is The American Experience (HIST-100gm), described on the USC Schedule of Classes as exploring the “patterns of American development from Colonial times to the present.” It is possible, perhaps, that the course is geared towards international students. But the fact that it is one of the only GE courses that fulfills the diversity requirement suggests that it, in practice, serves as a cop-out “diversity” course taken by U.S.-born students.
The problem is exacerbated by the fact that other GE courses that explore different aspects of diversity, such as GE I’s Jewish History (JS-100g), do not fulfill the requirement.
Certain communities are also excluded. The GE Category II (Global Cultures and Traditions) requirement for next semester encompasses 18 courses, including Japanese Civilization , Race and Sexual Politics in Southeast Asia (ANTH-250g) and East Asian Societies (EASC-150g). But again, only two of these courses fulfill the diversity requirement — Peoples and Cultures of the Americas (AMST-135gm) and the African Diaspora (AMST-250gm). It seems unfair that classes based entirely on Asian cultures do not qualify for the diversity requirement. Why should the Filipino, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Pacific Islander and Indian communities be excluded from the conversation about diversity — especially since 23 percent of the USC student population is Asian?
When considering that Asians play an increasingly profound role in the demographics of campus and the United States as a whole, the issue becomes all the more critical. Data from a 2013 U.S. Census report predicts that the Asian and Hispanic community will soon become majority groups in the United States — and according to the Associated Press, such a shift could happen as early as 2043.
“The fact that we’re going to be the majority just shows that people need to understand where we’re coming from,” said Cindy Le, finance director of the Student Coalition for Asian Pacific Empowerment. “If people don’t understand where we come from, all these microaggressions will keep happening. Racism is still very ingrained in our system and no one is consciously aware of it because they’re not educated about it.”
The problem applies to various Asian communities. Take, for example, the Indian community. Though there are courses in the GE II requirement about Russian, Korean, Chinese and Japanese civilizations, there are no GE II courses directly about India, even though it harbors 17.5 percent of the world’s population. In fact, in the entirety of the USC curriculum, while there is one course on Southeast Asia and one on South Asia, there are no classes at USC just concerning India for Spring 2015. Considering the proliferation of Indian and Indian-American students at USC, this is startling and a little confusing.
The disparity between USC’s demographics and its curriculum might take root in a larger issue about diversity on campus. Though USC touts one of the most impressive demographics (23 percent Asian, 13 percent Hispanic, 4 percent Black or African-American, 9 percent other minorities and a whopping 13 percent international students), self-segregation on campus greatly reduces the benefits that come from going to school with so many different kinds of people.
“I think we are diverse in numbers, but we’re not a diverse community in that we don’t interact with each other and we don’t work with each other as much as we could,” Le said.
Perhaps stereotypes and racial prejudices that still present themselves on campus are due to students who are products of a society of internalized racism. Perhaps they simply don’t know any better. Or maybe, just maybe, they are not receiving an education with enough diversity. It is not enough to teach someone about the history of another country or learn about the experiences of other peoples. Diversity comes from challenging the misconceptions that we have about other groups, be it racial, economic, political or otherwise.
This goes for not just USC, but other schools planning to do the same. Last Thursday, UCLA’s Legislative Assembly gave final approval to institute a diversity requirement. As our crosstown rival’s drive for diversity shows, such an initiative has unbridled potential to instill a greater appreciation for other cultures and change the way that students think  — but only if implemented correctly, with a good variety of classes.
It is not wrong to want more from this campus, and it is not wrong to want a campus that yields diversity not just in numbers, but also in ideas. If USC prides itself on diversity, then it must commit — to both admitting people from different backgrounds and fostering a classroom environment that allows them to question their own assumptions about other people as well.
