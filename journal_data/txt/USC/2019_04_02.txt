When Courtney Moore transferred to USC in Spring 2016, she knew that her family’s low socioeconomic status meant they would be unable to assist with living costs. So Moore, who has since graduated, made sure to apply for benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — otherwise known as food stamps — to supplement her grocery budget.
But a year after she matriculated at USC and had moved into Cardinal Gardens for the 2017-18 school year, she was told she was required to purchase USC’s mandatory apartment meal plan, adding $1,260 to her yearly expenses.
“When I found out I had to pay for [the apartment meal plan], I was shocked. I mean, I had to reevaluate my expenditures,” Moore said. 
Food insecurity affects thousands of students like Moore at USC, where in 2017, 21 percent of undergraduate students were eligible for Pell Grants — a form of federal aid granted to low-income students. Over 2,000 students visited the Trojan Food Pantry in Parkside Apartments last semester to pick up free groceries.
For many, restrictions and requirements like the apartment meal plan create an additional burden that hinders access to adequate amounts of healthy, affordable food. Students cite the high costs of food on and around campus, the expensive mandatory meal plans and poor University communication as issues that exacerbate food insecurity and consequently increase personal stress.
One of those students is Laura Pearson, a sophomore majoring in philosophy and cognitive science, who receives SNAP benefits and recently ran for a Undergraduate Student Government senator position with food insecurity as a platform point.
“With a lot of students here being fairly well-off, I think a lot of them don’t realize just how much of a struggle other students have that are not as financially secure,” Pearson said. “I also think that goes hand-in-hand with the administration.”
‘You do not have the chance to say no’
The apartment meal plan, which costs $1,300 for the 2018-19 school year, includes 150 dining dollars and 40 meal swipes per semester. That’s enough to cover roughly 110 meals, leaving more than 560 meals for students to cover on their own dimes throughout the year.
Students eligible for CalFresh, California’s extension of SNAP, receive anywhere from $100 to $200 a month to help pay for food — about the same price as the meal plan. But unlike the apartment meal plan, students say they can make CalFresh benefits last by using them at several stores, including Trader Joe’s and Target, to cover all of their groceries for the month.
“If someone has the ability to get funding from another entity, why should they be forced to use the dining dollars [and] the dining plan?” Pearson said.
The apartment meal plan was created to give students convenience, in addition to ensuring students have access to food, according to Associate Director of Residential Dining Erik Russell. But requests to opt out are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and students who are on SNAP cannot opt out.
“This is a situation in which a meal plan [has] price points that are wrong; you can argue the amount is awkward, and they’re pushing it onto people,” USG Sen. Gabriel Savage said. “You do not have the chance to say no. It’s frustrating.”
As a result, students like Moore have had to take out extra loans to cover the additional expenses the apartment meal plan poses. 
Moore fought the requirement after discovering the charge in her student account, teaming up with Mai Mizuno, then-USG director of community and external affairs, but ran into several dead ends. Eventually, Moore received an email from Lindsey Pine, a registered dietician working with USC Hospitality that read: “Financial issues and number of meals per day do not play a role in meal plan exemptions.”
 Later, Pine told her to consider off-campus living options.
“I felt like they believed that I had a choice, financially, to live off campus,” Moore said. “It didn’t seem as if they were understanding, or even trying to understand, and I felt like I was automatically denied the waiver regardless of my financial situation.”
Village for some, food desert for others
For low-income students living in or near USC Village, expensive food choices can create additional financial issues.
At SunLife Organics, a bowl or smoothie costs between $7 and $10, and the most expensive shake costs nearly $28.
At BBCM, the most popular entrees range from $16 to $30. Only one of its soup and salad options falls below $10. For pasta, the cheapest option is $19. Similarly at both Greenleaf and Saola, no sandwiches or burgers are cheaper than $10.
“I think that USC does a good job of recruiting low income students, but I think once they get in the doors … there are so many barriers,” said Alec Vandenberg, USG director of external affairs. “I think that USC Village is a prime example of that. It’s very catered to a certain population on campus that can afford it, and it’s very exclusionary.”
Many students are unhappy with how expensive the average meal at USC Village is. They are also unable to use meal swipes there.
“I tend to try not to eat on campus or at [USC Village] because of the prices,” Pearson said.
Sarah Portnoy, a USC faculty member who specializes in food deserts and food insecurity, said that “of course” low-income students might gravitate more toward unhealthy options like local fast food chains because of the cost of the food offered at USC Village.
“The area around USC is classified as a food desert,” Portnoy said.
Developing resources
Portnoy said that to combat some of these problems, she would suggest offering more affordable vendors or establishing a program with different price points depending on income status.
A few on-campus resources already exist to assist students who experience food insecurity. Toward the end of the 2017-18 school year, the Trojan Food Pantry transitioned from a virtual pantry to occupying a physical space on campus and in Fall 2018, it transferred from a room in the Student Union to a slightly larger location at the base of Parkside Apartments.
The pantry offers support for students trying to sign up for CalFresh, as well as food that food-insecure students can choose from weekly. However, the pantry previously did not allow students on the apartment meal plan to pick out food. 
Now, the pantry has moved to allow its services to be “only available to any currently enrolled USC student who does not have a dining hall meal plan or whose plan’s swipes have been fully used,” according to its website.
Between Sept. 7 and Dec. 19, over 2,200 people visited the food pantry, with roughly 60 to 70 attendees every day, according to Student Programs Advisor Luis Canton.
Another resource for students is the Late Night Hot Meal program, which is held at the United University Church on campus on Wednesdays. The program serves about 80 to 120 people every week and was established in Spring 2016.
Russell said USC encourages students to look outside the University for local resources, and to speak to financial aid or an EBT case worker. Russell also said more solutions may become available in the future, but that he’s not ready to give details at this time.
“There’s a lot of movement, and a lot of ideas on the table, and I think that you’re going to see this being more [of] a topic, and you’ll see more solutions as we move forward,” Russell said.

Sophomore midfielder Kelsey Huff scored the game-clinching goal in double overtime to lift USC to an 11-10 victory over Stanford Sunday. Junior midfielder Kerrigan Miller threatened the Cardinal defense just enough to draw an extra defender toward her before dumping the ball off to Huff who was in position to drill the game-winning shot.
The score was Huff’s team-leading fourth of the day to go with two ground balls and a caused turnover. 
The Trojans led 10-9 with a chance to seal the victory in regulation, but they committed two turnovers in the final minute of the game, allowing Stanford to tie the game and send it to overtime. 
Stanford sophomore attacker Katherine Gjertsen shot the ball wide of the goal with 11 seconds on the clock. USC sophomore goalie Riley Hertford left the goal in an attempt to gain possession for the Trojans, putting her out of position when Gjertsen tapped the ball in off of a quick restart from senior midfielder Genesis Lucero. 
The ball bounced into the goal as time expired, sending the game into overtime. However, USC did not let Stanford take any of its lingering momentum into the extra period. 
Sophomore defender Lizzy Wagner, who collected four ground balls and caused two turnovers for the Trojans, said the team kept its cool. 
“There were many uncontrollables throughout the game that demanded our composure, so we stuck to our game plan focusing on discipline and taking each play as they came,” Wagner said. 
In both of the overtime periods, Stanford gained possession off of the draw, a stat they dominated throughout the day, controlling 15 compared to USC’s nine.
The USC defense stood up to the sudden-death challenge, preventing Stanford from getting a clean look for about seven minutes of gameplay. Hertford came up big for USC with at least one save in each overtime period.
The teams combined for 47 turnovers in a sloppy game. While there were more than a few unforced errors, this high turnover number reflected the intensity of this matchup.
Both Stanford and USC played physically; Stanford drew three yellow cards while USC drew one but, for the most part, the refs let the teams play. 
On Friday, USC defeated Cal in dominant fashion, 16-4. Although the final score was a blowout, it took the Trojans 17 minutes to secure a lead and run with it. 
Senior attacker Emily Concialdi recorded a season-high four assists on the day, including assisting on 3 of USC’s first 4 goals to kick off the scoring. The team recorded a total of eight assists on the day, also a season high. 
Sisters Kelsey Huff and junior midfielder Kaeli Huff each recorded hat tricks on the day. 
The win over Stanford gives USC a stranglehold on the top seed in the Pac-12. Its conference record stands at a pristine 7-0 with three out of its final four games against conference rivals. A win over Colorado Friday at McAlister Field would clinch the top seed weeks before the tournament.

The Trojans claimed one victory in their three-game series against No. 1-ranked UCLA over the weekend.
USC won the first game of the series 7-2 at Dedeaux Field. The Trojans got off to a hot start with an RBI single from junior left fielder Blake Sabol in the first inning. The team quickly added another run in the third inning, courtesy of sophomore designated hitter Jamal O’Guinn.
The Trojans took complete control of the game in the fifth inning, scoring 3 more runs and taking a 5-0 lead. Junior center fielder Matthew Acosta piled on the runs as he hit a 2-run home run in the fifth, his second of the year. The Trojans went on to score 1 more that inning, courtesy of senior shortstop Chase Bushor.
The Bruins had trouble handling Trojan junior pitcher Connor Lunn, who started the season as the Trojans’ go-to closer, pitched nearly the entire game and departed the contest just one batter shy of going the full nine innings. He threw eight strikeouts and only allowed 2 earned runs against the top-seeded team in the country.
“So that actually is the longest outing of my career,” Lunn told the team’s official Twitter account after the game. “I kind of felt like everything was working today. I was pitching off my fastball a lot. I was throwing the slider a little bit. I was trying to mix locations a little bit and take it slow.”
USC head coach Dan Hubbs praised both his team and his star pitcher after the game.
“I told our guys after the game, I thought this was our most complete game of the year when you factor in how Connor pitched and how we played defense,” Hubbs said. “I mean we made some really nice plays on defense.”
However, the Trojans were unable to maintain their form from Friday’s game for the rest of the series, losing the second and third games 7-1 and 9-2, respectively.
The Bruins came out fast and firing in the second game of the series as they put up 3 runs in the first inning thanks to a 3-run shot from senior designated hitter Jake Pries. The Bruins were in complete control throughout the game and were up by 7 runs by the end of the fourth inning.
UCLA redshirt junior pitcher Jack Ralston was nearly unhittable in the game. Like Lunn in the series opener, Ralston was just one out shy of pitching a complete game. He was lights out on the mound, allowing only 1 earned run and throwing four strikeouts. 
“Their kid threw really well,” Hubbs said after the game. “I mean that’s kind of the game, right? Yesterday Connor threw really well, and we beat them 7-2. Today their kid threw really well, and they won 7-1.”
In the final game of the series, the Trojans got off to an early lead in the first inning with an RBI sacrifice fly from sophomore third baseman Ben Ramirez. The team was only able to score 1 run in the bottom of the first despite loading the bases.
UCLA quickly countered with 2 runs of its own in the top of the second, but the Trojans scored 1 on a UCLA throwing error in the second inning to level the score. 
However, the Trojans were unable to score any more runs for the rest of the game and allowed the Bruins to score 7 more to take the game, 9-2.
The game marked yet another loss for sophomore pitcher Kyle Hurt, who has been unable to replicate his promising freshman season. Hurt, who came into the season as the Trojans’ number one starting pitcher, has yet to win a game this year, currently sporting an 0-4 record. 
The Trojans now sit at 10-16 on the year and will continue to face tough opponents both in and out of conference play.
USC will follow up this series with an away game at UC Santa Barbara. The Gauchos have looked impressive this season with a record of 19-5 on the year. Earlier this season, the Gauchos defeated the Trojans at Dedeaux Field by a score of 2-1.
The matchup will take place at UC Santa Barbara at 3 p.m. Tuesday.

Former ESPN writer and founder of The Ringer Bill Simmons once proposed injecting excitement into the NBA’s Most Valuable Player award discussion by handing out trophies of various weights depending on the quality of the race and the player’s performance. The greater the player’s season and the tougher the competition, the bigger and heavier the trophy — from a one-pounder for the weakest victory to a 40-pounder for a pantheon-level performance.
This year’s race may not quite deserve a 40-pounder, but it has been wildly entertaining. In one corner, you have Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, a 7-foot cheat code with the athleticism of a guard and the wingspan of Mr. Fantastic. In the other corner, you have Houston Rockets guard James Harden, a one-man band who earned his coveted first MVP award last season with incredible statistical production and hasn’t slowed down since. Some people look for different traits from an MVP candidate, so with the NBA regular season winding down, let’s break down the case for each of these amazing players.
A quick glance at the per game numbers suggests that there’s no contest here — Harden should be the MVP. After working perfectly alongside the newly acquired Chris Paul to help the Rockets earn the No. 1 seed last season, Harden has had to take on much more of the load this season with major contributors such as Paul and center Clint Capela missing time with injuries, and that shows in his mind-boggling numbers. Harden is averaging 36.4 points, 6.5 rebounds and 7.5 assists per game, according to Basketball Reference. If the season ended today, Harden would finish with the seventh-highest individual scoring season of all time.
Antetokounmpo’s statistics, while impressive, do not stack up to Harden’s: He averages 9 points fewer at 27.4, and while he does boast a decided edge in rebounding at 12.5, his six assists also lag behind Harden. But let’s take a closer look at some other numbers that turn the tables on this debate.
A large part of Harden’s eye-popping totals come from his 40.66% usage rate, which would place second all-time behind only Russell Westbrook’s 2017 MVP campaign. Harden’s ability to consistently produce when the focus rests entirely on him is impressive in its own right, but it does explain the historic nature of his numbers. Antetokounmpo has a similarly massive impact on the game, but does so with a usage rate of 32.1, meaning he needs fewer opportunities to influence the game.
Antetokounmpo’s edge in efficiency is reflected in both players’ shooting percentages. Harden’s 43.8% mark from the field pales in comparison to Antetokounmpo’s uber-efficient 58%. In addition, despite Harden’s ability to score 3-pointers, Antetokounmpo holds a decisive advantage in effective field goal percentage, which adjusts for the fact that threes are worth more than twos, as well as true shooting percentage, which takes free throws into account.
Looking at per-36 minute numbers emphasizes Harden’s reliance on massive opportunity. Harden plays four minutes more per game than his competitor, so this adjustment gives a clearer picture of what each is accomplishing during his time on the court. Antetokounmpo’s numbers jump to 30/13.7/6.6, while Harden’s “drop” to 35.3/6.3/7.3.
This is a great MVP race, so I can certainly see why Harden would garner votes. The two are in a dead heat in multiple measures of overall impact, with nearly identical player efficiency ratings and win shares. But if you look at the standings, you see the best reason for picking Antetokounmpo and the factor that separates him from Harden for me. 
The Bucks have the best record in the NBA at 57-20 and are on pace to win over 60 games. The Rockets, meanwhile, are 49-28 and hold the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference. More importantly, the Bucks’ plus-9.3 point differential, which is often a better reflection of a team’s performance, is by far the best in the league. There were times this season when the Bucks graded as one of the top teams of all time statistically.
Antetokounmpo’s fingerprints are all over the Bucks’ success: Milwaukee’s net rating drops from a fantastic 12.7 with Antetokounmpo to a pedestrian 3.7 without the Greek Freak, according to NBA.com, whereas Houston only drops 2 points in net rating from 4.7 to 2.7 when Harden departs. Per 100 possessions, Antetokounmpo owns an offensive rating of 121 (which should ideally be higher) and a defensive rating of 99 (which should ideally be lower), both of which outstrip Harden’s marks of 118 and 108, respectively.
Antetokounmpo turns a good team into a great one when he’s on the court, and Harden keeps a squad with underwhelming talent afloat. Both are valiant causes, but I side with the guy who leads the best team, and that’s Antetokounmpo. He deserves to be rewarded for winning, which is the whole point of playing.
The great part about having such a neck-and-neck race is that this could all change even in the final eight or so games. With the talent Antetokounmpo and Harden possess, it’s certainly possible for either to separate himself. That’s what’s cool about this era of the NBA; there are so many talented and charismatic stars to capture our imagination. Let’s just hope this level of intrigue persists into the postseason.

JPEGMAFIA’s voice, beats and stage presence are so impressive, it’s hard to believe he’s still only an opening act.
The experimental hip-hop artist and self-proclaimed “left-wing Hades” performed at The Novo in downtown Los Angeles Saturday as the appetizer for rapper Vince Staples’ tour. Although his set only lasted half an hour, his keen command of the crowd and electric performance, coupled with the freshness and punchiness of his songs, made his set the highlight of the evening.
JPEGMAFIA resides within a very particular and complex niche of rap music. His sample-heavy, glitchy instrumentals and bitterly ironic lyrics speak a language that’s hard to decipher for anyone who is new to his aesthetic. 
The rapper’s ability to reconstruct sample-heavy instrumentation speak to the political frustration of modern times (evident in his lyrics like “roll deep like the ket … fake news we ain’t pressed”) and deliver it all in a callous, tongue-in-cheek way makes him an incredibly jarring listen for non-hip-hop-heads. However, for those who are regularly sifting through the incredibly saturated rap market, “Peggy’s” (as his fans have affectionately nicknamed him) ability to capture all these nuances have benchmarked him as a sort of Messiah. He’s able to speak the language of rap fluently, passionately, with almost sermon-like — even while his style is still developing.
Therefore, it’s no wonder that the audience seemed to admire even his quick performance Sunday night. From start to finish, his set was a cathartic explosion of sonic colors. Beginning with his feature from Denzel Curry’s “VENGEANCE” and only intensifying from there, a mosh pit had already formed and peaked within the first four bars. JPEG effortlessly guided the crowd into a gorgeous blend of camaraderie and fury as the moshing intensified in the center of the venue.  
The vigor of the audience can be attributed to Peggy’s experience as an artist. It’s rare for a rap artist to make moshers who are actively begging to get the wind knocked out of them need to tap out for a brief moment. Though his career is only just beginning and not a single song played was released earlier than 2018, he’s on his second album and knows how to push all the right buttons as an emcee. Time and time again, he entered the crowd, dreamily drew out his lyrics and emanated a confidence that the audience lapped up. Even those who only came for Vince Staples’ main act were at least visibly impressed by JPEGMAFIA’s performance, if not eagerly downloading his latest album “Veteran” to their Spotify accounts as quickly as their fingers could type.
It almost seemed like a mistake on Staples’ part to have JPEGMAFIA open for him. While Vince’s music was certainly more instrumentally lush, his energy level never came close to that of his opener. The same people who rallied for the mosh pit during Peggy’s hit songs opted to sit out during Staples’. While Peggy’s set was minimal compared to Staples’ elaborate backdrop, the main act fell significantly short in terms of crowd engagement.  
Overall, there was not a single dull moment during JPEGMAFIA’s act. Those who needed to gasp for air might not have appreciated its seemingly interminable, non-stop energy. However, the rapid-fire set was downright flawless at capturing the essence of an artist at their most energetic.

I’m very picky about the accounts I follow on Instagram. I’m a big believer in having my visual surroundings — physical or digital — tangibly reflect the life I aspire to live.  I want the content I see when I’m mindlessly scrolling through the app to be aesthetically pleasing and evoke positive feelings.
So, I primarily follow my friends, colleagues, influencers and photographers, all of whom inspire me to be the best version of myself. But when it comes to retail brands, I’m especially picky. 
When I was little, my mother wouldn’t let me wear clothes with gaudy logos because she didn’t want me to be a “walking advertisement.” As a result, in life and in my social media habits, I’ve adopted an attitude to separate my identity from brands — or so I’ve tried. 
With the rise of brands that were born and bred online like Glossier, Curology and Away, the line between brand and lifestyle content has become increasingly blurred. A digitally native brand, as opposed to a physical brick-and-mortar store, is a brand that launches its products and campaigns strictly through digital platforms. Traditional retailers are only now beginning to catch up, but they can hardly be known for their online presences in the same way digitally native brands are.
Digitally native brands are appealing for two reasons: accessibility and aesthetic.
For instance, anyone (and I mean anyone) who knows me knows that I’m obsessed with the clothing store Brandy Melville. My hometown, however, did not have a physical Brandy storefront, so I used to have to hunt a location down whenever I went on trips to big cities. 
Take, for example, Glossier — everyone’s favorite pretty, minimalist and millennial makeup and skincare brand. In 2014, founder and CEO Emily Weiss turned her beauty blog “Into The Gloss” into a reader-first experience that delivers products directly based on feedback from customers, which are referred to as “beauty editors.” With a customer-centered brand strategy from the start paired with thorough social media marketing, the Glossier lifestyle is accessible to anyone, and physical manifestations are pushed to the wayside.
On the aesthetic side, let’s face it: Brands like Glossier not only look good, but they have killer Instagram feeds. Glossier embodies millennial/Gen Z visual culture: simple, pastel and back to basics. As  one Medium user put it, the environment surrounding Glossier is almost “cult-status.”
Because Glossier first crafted its presence on social media, when customers acquire any of their products, their first instinct is to turn to social media to share that they, too, are now a part of the trend. Additionally, the products themselves are inherently photographable for social media because of how they’re packaged and presented. The establishment of their first storefront on Melrose Place only further sensationalizes the brand, creating a real-life space that is the physical embodiment of its Instagram page. (I’ve seen one too many photos of people posing in front of the Glossier mirror, but I’ll admit I’m guilty of taking that photo, too).
“Glossier could literally make an assault rifle and as long as it’s millennial pink and ‘moisturizing’ my dumb ass would buy it,” junior Kylie Harrington tweeted in December.
Simply put, I want to buy it because it’s pretty and it looks good on my desk, my face and my Instagram feed.
From a marketing perspective, Glossier is pure genius, but from a human standpoint, the blurred line between brand, culture and real life can be dangerous. Like many digitally native, aesthetic-driven brands, “lifestyle” photos — images that candidly depict people having the product in their everyday lives — trick customers into seeing the product not as a commodity, but as a personality choice. 
When I’m scrolling through Instagram and a Glossier photo pops up, I often don’t even fully register that it’s a branded post. So I “like” the photo and move on to the next post of my friend and her dog.
At the end of the day, it’s just a product carefully shaped by branding, and I’m not truly a different person for buying into it. I still make the same bad jokes and am late to everything, but with a shinier face, new Instagram posts and slightly emptier bank account.
Sometimes, I think my mom was right about creating a distinction between myself and products for life’s sake, but will I actually stop buying into “aesthetic” brands any time soon? Sorry, I think I like my trendy highlighter a little too much.

AAs the semester winds down, streaming services provide a much-needed escape from everyday stress. Starting in April, several major (and new) streaming sites will offer a wide array of original content. From fire-breathing dragons to a magic shop that stocks unicorns, here are a few essential new and returning shows and original films everyone should be streaming this month. 
NETFLIX
Unicorn Store 
April 5
Best known for her roles in “Room” and “Captain Marvel,” Brie Larson makes her directorial debut in  the upcoming Netflix original film “Unicorn Store.” The dramedy follows Kit (played by Larson) who finally gets a chance to fulfill her lifelong dream of adopting a unicorn after failing out of art school. Samuel L. Jackson co-stars as the salesman of a magical shop from which Kit arranges to adopt her unicorn. In addition to its highly entertaining premise, “Unicorn Store” is the first film produced by 51 Entertainment, a production company that supports female directors.
Special
April 12
Netflix’s new original television comedy “Special” tells the story of Ryan, a disabled, gay man in his 20s who gets into a car accident and begins to play off his disability as an injury from the accident. The show is based on the 2015 memoir “I’m Special: And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves,” written by the show’s creator and star Ryan O’Connell, who pretended to be injured after an accident even though he had suffered from cerebral palsy for years. In a recent interview with Vulture, O’Connell said that he hoped the show would empower disabled people and allow them to “tell their own stories and be in charge of it.”

Someone Great
April 19
“Someone Great” stars “Jane the Virgin” frontwoman Gina Rodriguez as Jenny, a music journalist from New York City who needs to move to San Francisco for work but cannot convince her boyfriend to make the move with her. Before she sets off to start her new job, Jenny recruits her two best friends — played by DeWanda Wise and Brittany Snow — for a wild night out in NYC to help her cope with the imminent end of her nine-year relationship. With Rodriguez and Lakeith Stanfield (who plays Jenny’s boyfriend) as its leads, “Something Great” looks to capitalize the growing popularity of Netflix rom-coms. 
HBO
Native Son
April 6
Based on the novel by Richard Wright, HBO’s new original film “Native Son” tells the story of Bigger Thomas, a young African American man living in Chicago who enters a new world of money and power after being hired as a chauffeur for affluent businessman Will Dalton. Director Rashid Johnson jettisons the novel’s 1930s setting in favor of the modern day, and according to Variety, Ashton Sanders delivers a “poetic performance” as Thomas to follow up his roles in “Moonlight” and “The Equalizer 2.” Critics have praised “Native Son”’s arresting cinematography and inspired commentary on race relations in the United States, but suggest that Johnson’s work is ultimately flawed and problematically adapted. Either way, its stellar performances and intriguing premise are sure to spark interest and conversation. 
Game of Thrones 
April 14
Nearly two years after its last season ended, HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” based of of the “Song of Ice and Fire” series by George R.R .Martin, returns for its eighth and final season on April 14. The series, which has now run off-course from the books, will follow Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow as they try to rally their armies against the White Walkers, while Cersei Lannister attempts to maintain her grip on power. Season 8 will include the entire principal cast and take place over six episodes, more than half of which run roughly 90 minutes long. The final season of the  wildly popular fantasy series is also rumored to include the Battle of Winterfell, the longest consecutive battle sequence ever committed to film or television. After years of multiple storylines spread across the fictitious realm of Westeros, viewers can finally see all of them merge into an ending that is guaranteed to be “bittersweet,” by Martin.

CBS ALL ACCESS
The Twilight Zone
April 1
CBS looks to a revive an American classic with its upcoming reboot of “The Twilight Zone,” Rod Serling’s 1960s anthology series of the same name. “The Twilight Zone” is produced by writer and director Jordan Peele, who hopes to continue his examination of American social and political fissures through chilling tales such as his two feature films, “Get Out” and “Us.” Like the original series, each episode of Peele’s reboot will tell a different story and reimagine some of the series’ best-known episodes. The show stars Steven Yeun, Kumail Nanjiani, Tracy Morgan, John Cho and Adam Scott, among others, in episodic roles while Peele emulates Serling as the show’s host. “The Twilight Zone” is now streaming exclusively on CBS All Access. 
SHOWTIME
The Chi
April 7
After a promising first season, Emmy Award-winner Lena Waithe’s “The Chi” returns for its second season on Showtime. The drama explores the complexities of life in the South side of Chicago through the perspectives of its residents. Largely a character study, the series touches upon myriad themes such as violence, social justice and race relations. “The Chi”’s character’s have depth, and their interactions with various authoritative institutions, such as the Chicago Police Department, are complex and multilayered. Season 2 will follow pre-teen protagonist Kevin as he looks to recover from previous traumas of while the series’ other characters combat their personal struggles in the fluctuating Chicago landscape. After earning three nominations at the NAACP Image Awards, Waithe will surely continue to capture what life is truly like for citizens of Chicago.

Staff members who oversee college residential life are some of the most important people in shaping students’ lives. Whether it be fulfilling individualized orders and serving food at campus dining halls or assisting new students with building security measures, dining hall staff and housing security guards are essential to USC. But while these staff members interact with students every day, most students hardly to get to know them, learn their names or hold a full conversation with them. Thus, students need to establish better relationships with staff members to promote a better sense of community.
It’s imperative that students create stronger human connections with the residential staff who influence their daily lives — from the moment students step out of their residential  buildings heading to their first classes to the late hours they return home at night. With so many readily available opportunities for contact, it’s a shame that such a pronounced rift persists. 
In order to eliminate these barriers, USC administration needs to facilitate student-staff interactions. To start, all USC Hospitality, Housing and the Department of Public Safety staff members should be given name tags to help ignite conversations. The system would be easy to implement, as Customer Service Center workers currently wear such tags. This change would help students with putting a name to a face and open the door for conversations and connections. 
Implementing staff name tags is not a new idea. USC’s dining hall staff has donned name tags in the past, and according to USC Hospitality Assistant Vice President Kris Klinger, they are considering implementing them again. The tags would help ease students into conversing with staff and getting to know them better, allowing for stronger communal relations and, in turn, a friendlier environment. 
“Get to know each other’s names and use them when greeting each other. Learn a little about each other and celebrate special occasions,” Klinger advised in an email to the Daily Trojan.
USC Housing Senior Associate Director Chris Ponsiglione agrees that housing staff and students should establish stronger connections. Housing security guards are in constant contact with students and are expected to protect them from harm in their residential buildings. The closeness of this relationship reveals the necessity for security guards and students to treat one another as more than just acquaintances.
“Housing works with our security vendor to train their staff to put customer service as a priority,” Ponsiglione said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “They are expected to treat the students as they would want their own children or family treated.” 
However, Ponsiglione is opposed to the idea of name tags. Even though it may seem like a simple solution to create a sense of community, he raised the concern that being too friendly with students can infringe on guards’ duties. Security guards are rotated often for this reason, as it keeps them from becoming too familiar with student residents.
“Familiarity can be counter to the objective nature of security services,” Ponsiglione wrote. “We generally discourage the guards from acting too familiar with the residents. Moving their assignments is sometimes a factor of staff turnover but also in order to ensure that the staff is able to function as an independent monitor.”
It is fair to acknowledge that security guards should not be distracted from performing their jobs. Nonetheless, being greeted by a familiar face and having a friendly conversation can never hurt. In the end, encouraging a supportive community where students and staff members alike can feel comfortable knowing they can have a friendly conversation will always improve campus life.
Because it’s easy for students to get overwhelmed, it’s important for students to establish strong relationships with staff to ensure that they can create a comfortable environment where they can feel at home. And this goes both ways. Staff, with the help of administration, need to make sure they are putting out the best hospitable efforts to take care of their students — student interactions can also make their jobs more enjoyable. Otherwise, we’ll continue to remain in a world of anonymity that feels nothing like a home away from home.

With the 2020 presidential elections in sight, many have reflected on the different communities that have voted in past elections, as well as the ideas that motivate them to do so. 
Author and political scientist Katherine Cramer found that rural communities are pervaded with resentment, partly directed toward decision makers in Washington, D.C., with their conversations routinely failing to include small-town America. Their anger is also directed toward urban liberals — who have received their fair share of resources and attention — while neglecting and maligning rural conservatives. We have a responsibility as citizens to give oft-neglected communities our attention and understanding, rather than blame rural voters for their voting tendencies.
Rural resentment is not unfounded and is undoubtedly aggravated by the troubling state of small town economies. A decades-long decline in productivity, income and employment has weakened the livelihoods of many small counties. The coal plants that have propped up rural towns are closing in numbers, and many Americans have watched factories displace their jobs overseas. Opioid dependency has become a rural epidemic, and small town populations are aging as younger workers move to cities in search of work. Rural America is rusting, and there is little being done about it.
Though these generalizations do not apply to every rural community, they still point to a number of distressing trends evident in rural life. It should come as no surprise that feelings of economic and social injustice have been brewing in especially affected communities. These communities face budget cuts, hospital closures and infrastructure decline, while cities gather funding for another high-speed railway. 
It is not surprising that rural voters turned out in mass numbers to support President Donald Trump in the 2016 election. His campaign was successful because he gave these communities the attention and assurance they felt deprived of. When Ford Motors released a plan to close down a Michigan factory and relocate it to Mexico, Trump said he would impose a 35% tariff on any cars the company imported. He promised to “Make America Great Again,” and it won him the rural vote.
Trump’s victory did not bring attention to neglected American towns so much as it brought blame. Resentment, after all, is not a one-way street. There is a distinct perception that the average Trump supporter is undereducated, authoritarian and even racist. This designation only widens political divisions and neglects valid reasons as to why rural voters cast their votes for Trump. 
With the 2020 election on the horizon, it’s important to recognize the factors that shaped Trump’s victory. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign largely failed to  appeal to the rural vote, neglecting to set up a rural council as former President Barack Obama did in his campaigns. To a population that feels disregarded by mainstream politics, this did little to assure rural populations that their issues would be prioritized. 
The aim of identifying Clinton’s missteps is not simply to secure a victory in the upcoming election by addressing rural resentment. The goal is to be more understanding of the these communities’ struggles and to offer them our attention. With the next election only a year away, we have to consider which issues will be at the center of our political discussions and the issues of rural America are surely worth including.
