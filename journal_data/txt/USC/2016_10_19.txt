As Halloween approaches, Fox is set to release the highly anticipated reboot of The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Lets Do The Time Warp Again. With people getting in the holiday spirit, the new version of the 1975 cult classic is sure to draw a significant amount of new viewers in addition to the notoriously enthusiastic long term fans. However, those that have seen the original film may not necessarily be impressed by the latest made-for-television musical. 
Perhaps in the name of purism, Fox chose to stick closely to the original plot line. The film follows newly engaged sweethearts Janet (Victoria Justice) and Brad (Ryan McCartan) and their accidental meeting with Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Laverne Cox).
 The flirtatious and sexually ambiguous doctor informs them that they have arrived just in time for the unveiling of the “the perfect male specimen,” created to fulfill Frank’s desires. Chaos, jealousy and lust inevitably ensue creating the dynamic drama the made the original film a niche hit. 
While the vibrant remake is not necessarily innovative, it does have a refreshing modern appeal, to the credit of director Kenny Ortega of High School Musical fame. His upgrades in choreography and costume are apparent throughout the film. For example, one of Dr. Frank-N-Furter’s groupies Columbia’s famous tap shoes are replaced by glittery Doc Martens, a nod to the recent millennial trend. 
Additionally, Ortega chose to pay homage to the midnight showing crowds that made transformed the film into a form of interactive entertainment.
The film utilizes self-conscious framing too by cutting to an old movie theatre during pivotal scenes where the audience is dressed in costume and even adding dialogue in reaction. Although, the thought is clever these transitions are often distracting and unnecessary. 
Despite this, audience members will find satisfaction in seeing the incredible collection of actors featured. Emmy-nominated actress Laverne Cox demonstrates incredible stamina and dramatic range in the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter. 
As an African American, transgender actress in a part once played by a straight white man, her performance is a testament to the sexual politics illuminated in the musical. However, other than this, the film does not maintain its original shock factor and appears sanitized to conform with network standards. 
The studio also had the foresight to cast former Nickelodeon teen star Justice as Janet Weiss. Justice’s own public image of innocence made her character’s on-screen sexual awakening all the more believable. The actress brought a girlish flair to Susan Sarandon’s lusty “Touch-a-Touch-a-Touch Me,” proving her ability to transform into more sophisticated roles. 
Another pivotal casting decision to make Tim Curry, the original Dr. Frank-N-Furter, the narrator shows the star’s blessing of the remake. However, many critics feel his approval is unwarranted. 
Re-entry into the time warp has proved to be bumpier than anticipated for Fox in light of these less-than-stellar reviews. Yet, the film is still a fun, Halloween special that is sure to appeal younger audiences wanting to see what The Rocky Horror craze is all about.

Savory herb-infused deep-fried falafels, aromatic arrays of spices and colorful assortments of dried fruits and nuts — images like these of the Israeli marketplaces I visited this past summer infiltrate my mind as I dissociate from the stresses of school. Struck by an unhealthy dose of wanderlust after my surreal travels in the Middle East, I’ve made a commitment to travel whenever I get the opportunity, to explore foreign cultures, savor discomfort as a necessary medium for growth and to overall live more audaciously.
I spent 10 days in Israel on Birthright, an organized trip for Jewish adults, and allocated another week to exploring the metropolitan city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. A key component to immersing myself in the culture consisted of my lavish indulgement in the myriad of locally grown plant-based foods. 
Everything tastes better in Israel. Perhaps this is due in part to the fact that Israel holds one of the world’s most advanced agricultural systems, in both technology and sustainability, and grows most of its food, including a variety of more than 40 different fruits. Israel also happens to be one of the world’s largest citrus producers and exporters, as stated by Milind Ladaniya in her academic book, Citrus Fruit: Biology, Technology and Evaluation.
Regardless of price (although food in Israel is overwhelmingly cheap — a falafel in a pita was usually around 16 shekels, or roughly $4) and convenience, the meals I ate always maintained, at the very least, a four-star quality. I ate falafel and hummus almost everyday I was there. Although falafel, comprised of ground chickpeas, seemingly wouldn’t offer much variation, each vendor’s addition or absence of parsley, scallions, garlic or spices such as coriander and cumin worked to reinvent each falafel I bit into. My interest in the constitution of the perfect falafel led to my daily assessment of falafels based on taste, price and aesthetic (my Birthright buddies can attest to my daily Instagram-worthy food porn). 
Aside from the multitude of falafels I ate, I also regularly drank refreshing smoothies infused with boba at B-Fresh  — hands down the best juice bar, located across from the Tel Aviv Beach — and helped myself to veganized chocolate chip crepes and chickpea pancakes at Benedict, delectable vegan ice creams and sorbets at Leggenda, portobello mushroom burgers at Burger Bar and superfood infused juices offered at virtually every marketplace. 
Although vegetables are one of the main staples of Middle Eastern food, it’s no coincidence that most restaurants in Israel have “Vegan-Friendly.CO.IL” beet heart-shaped stickers on their front windows. In fact, Israel is quickly turning into one of the most vegan friendly countries in the world. In 2015, a survey conducted by Israel’s Channel 2 News found that “Israel is home to the largest percentage of vegans per capita in the world. Approximately 5 percent of Israelis( 300,000) are vegans [and 13 percent are vegetarian or vegan], compared to 2 percent of U.S. citizens” as stated by the Jewish Virtual Library. Jewish American animal rights activist, Gary Yourofsky, is an integral part of Israel’s vegan movement. In 2010, Yourofsky’s now famous speech at Georgia Tech, “Best Speech You Will Ever Hear – Gary Yourofsky,” was filmed and uploaded onto YouTube. The video was quickly translated into 36 different languages, Hebrew among them. The video quickly gained popularity in Israel, likely for Yourofsky’s comparison of the animal slaughter to the Holocaust. The country’s vegan transformation doesn’t stop at Israeli-owned restaurants. The Israeli Domino’s chain is the only one in the world that offers a soy-cheese vegan pizza. What’s most interesting is that,  according to Sara Toth Stub, a writer for the Tablet, “vegans in Israel are driven more by animal rights than by health concerns and adopt a militant stance in defense and promotion of their cause.”
So Trojans, whether you adopt a plant-based lifestyle for animal rights, health or the environment, I urge you to make an effort. Whether it’s Mediterranean salads once a week or a smoothie for breakfast on the weekends, you’re well on your way to peaceful protestation for the undeniably and unjustifiably oppressive and exploitative animal-based industries.
Tessa Nesis is a sophomore majoring in NGOs and social change.  Her column, “The Sentient Bean,” runs on Thursdays.
A great insight into what America could be like without a totally corrupt corporate government that is completely beholden to the animal agriculture industry.

Undergraduate Student Government’s Performing Arts Committee is set to host its third annual Battle of the Bands Friday in Tommy’s Place at 8 p.m. The night will feature performances from some of USC’s best talent, including Heartwood, The Nova Darlings and Spritely as they battle it out to be crowned USC’s best band. 
Heartwood competed in last year’s Battle of the Bands and have recently been featured as Deli Magazine’s artist of the month in September. The band consists of frontman and multi-instrumentalist Michael Armstrong, guitarist Pat Rector, bassist Ameet Eini and drummer James Prinzi. The group has performed heavily around the Los Angeles area, and have released two single on Soundcloud including “Can’t You” and “Peace of Mind.” With their unique rock-and-roll sound, Heartwood will definitely set the bar high for the competition. 
New to Battle of the Bands this year is The Nova Darlings, a rock group with core members Mackin Carroll on bass and vocals, Larry Scanniello on guitar and Carter Couron on drums. The group has previously released an EP entitled Songs for Felix, and have played throughout Southern California at venues like the Constellation Room at the Observatory, The Satellite, The Warehouse, The Mint and more. The Nova Darlings combine Carroll’s thoughtful and introspective lyrics with punk rock melodies and killer guitar solos, to make them a group to be reckoned with.
Lastly, defending their 2014 Battle of the Bands title is Spritely, back to compete, this time with some new music and a more polished sound. A project of lead singer Jillian Lavin, the band has recently released various singles, including “Disposable,” “Second Love” and “I Shouldn’t Need,” the latter gaining online attention from music blogs such as Ear To The Ground. The band also features Pat Rector on guitar, Philip Labes on bass, Michael Arrom on keys, Julian McClanahan on violin and Kiko Brenneisen on drums. Spritely recently announced that they will be releasing a new single, “A Little Bit Broken,” on Friday, which may make its way into their Battle of the Bands set. Their whimsical sounds and edgy lyrics have won over the audience before, and it may just happen again on Friday.
In addition to performances by some of USC’s best musicians, the event will also feature various blanket forts throughout Tommy’s Place. Attendees can hang out in the forts and each fort will have a musical theme, including jazz, country, rock, disco and psychedelic. 
“We were hoping to create a more interactive event so that the audience can engage with the music and have fun on a more active level,” said Amanda Liaw, PAC Logistics Coordinator. “We’re also going to be placing laptops in the forts for audience members to vote for their favorite band.”
At the event there will be an online poll to choose the top two bands. The event will close with the audience will choosing the winner based on cheering. While all bands will receive PAC swag, the winners will receive a Pizza Studio gift card and title of USC’s Best Band.

Located along the L.A. River, the new Sonora-style barbecue and tacos restaurant Salazar fits in seamlessly alongside the quickly gentrifying neighborhood of Frogtown. Reconstructed from what used to be a rundown auto mechanic shop, Salazar is now a vibrant one-stop shop for exclusive craft beers, hand-made tortillas, sous-vide cooked meats and seasonal desserts.
The exterior of the restaurant falls nothing short of what is expected of a new restaurant in the hipster-obsessed landscape revolution of Los Angeles. Minimalist string lights flow from one end of the restaurant to the other, brightening up the mostly outdoor dining area. The dining area is lit almost entirely from candles and the floor is covered in sand and surrounded by cactus and palm trees, an aesthetic that when combined with the arid outdoor air and the natural light from the stars creates a dining experience that is reminiscent of eating in the backyard of a desert luxury home. The walls of the restaurant’s partially indoors section were retained from the old mechanic shop, creating an induWith Salazar being nearly as well known for their specialty drinks
The other half of their menu is dedicated to their food, separated into four categories: del taquero (the tacos and quesadillas), los primitivos (meats) and lados (sides). All dishes at Salazar are meant to be shared family style, and one order from the Del Taquero section of the menu contains three small tacos or quesadillas. What really sets the restaurant apart,though, is its business model and food preparation. The restaurant keeps everything in-house and nothing is outsourced —  the tortillas are all handmade and styled after the thin and tender tortillas in Sonora, while the meats are cooked sous-vide, meaning prepared in airtight plastic bags to retain moisture and flavor.
Diners have the option of filling their tacos or quesadillas with carne asada, pollo asado, al pastor or seasonal vegetables. Regardless of the filling, the experience will be the same — a juicy, flavor-packed taquero that will leave the customer wanting seconds. Main course proteins found under Los Primitivos such as the flat iron steak or pork chop are cooked in the same way and served on a giant plate on top a bed of crisp fries. Some current seasonal desserts include its homemade pumpkin-spiced flan and pumpkin cheesecake.
Despite being located in a town that is still being gentrified, Salazar’s individuality and premium quality food is making waves among foodies and casual eaters alike. Salazar has created a comfortable spot for itself as a trailblazer for a modern day Mexican dining experience in the ever-evolving L.A. food landscape.

To say that the USC women’s cross country team is young is an understatement. 
Eight of the 11 competitors running for USC are underclassmen — six of those being either sophomores or redshirt sophomores. In fact, the team boasts only two redshirt seniors on its roster this season. 
It’s the team’s youth that keeps the program looking forward. 
“It’s been really exciting to see their development throughout the past year and into this year,” said David Freeman, head coach of the women’s cross country team. “The future is bright for us because we are young with all of the freshman and sophomore runners we have right now. It’s just the growing process that we are going through right now.”
USC finished fifth overall — in a field of seven teams — at the Highlander Invitational in Riverside last Saturday. The team now looks toward Pac-12 Championships on Oct. 28 in Tucson, Arizona. 
Sophomore Sophia Racette has been the top performer for the Women of Troy this season. Racette, who did not compete her freshman year due to injury, has been the top-finisher for USC in all three races that she has run this season. At the Highlander Invitational, Racette finished fourth overall as an individual, posting a personal-best time in the 5K race (17:27.93). Racette also achieved a personal-best in the 6K race (21:12.1) at the UC Riverside Invitational on Sept. 17. 
“She’s becoming a pretty good runner. This is her first real year running cross country, so she’s still learning how to race against a bigger crowd and maneuver the race track,” Freeman said. “But overall, she’s doing great and really leading the way for us.”
Five of USC’s nine runners at the Highlander Invitational achieved either personal or collegiate-bests at the meet.
Sophomore Amber Gore, who finished 12th overall at the Highlander Invitational, was the second-fastest USC finisher and achieved a collegiate-best time in the 5K race (17:49.38) in Riverside last weekend. 
“Everyone is improving with every race, and we just have such a great team chemistry. It just makes me so excited to go out there and run with them,” said Gore, who has hit a personal-best in the 6K race as well this season (21:37.30). “We’re accomplishing a lot of goals right now, so it just makes our team look forward to the future.”
On Nov. 11, the team took first place at the Pepperdine Invitational in a five-team field that included Long Beach State, UC Irvine and host Pepperdine. USC also logged a seventh and 13th-place finish at the UC Riverside Invitational and NCAA West Region Preview races, respectively.
The team was scheduled to compete at the Titan Invitational in Fullerton Friday but has since announced it will forgo this race. The decision was made due to the team’s need for rest entering Pac-12 Championships, according to Freeman. 
When the Women of Troy hit the road for Pac-12 Championships next week, they will be pitted against the elite of the elite in collegiate cross country today. The Pac-12 Conference has seven of its 12 programs ranked in the top-25 nationally — including three which are ranked in the top five. 
“Our goal is really to just get better … if we can [hit personal-bests] across the board and have a strong team finish, that’s as much as you can ask for,” Freeman said. “It’s really going to be about going out there and running against the best — competing against the best. We’ll see where we stack up and learn from that experience. We can grow from that experience.”
Following the Pac-12 Championships, USC will compete at the NCAA West Regional Championships on Nov. 11 in Sacramento.

This weekend, the women’s volleyball team looks to continue to build off its victories against Oregon and Oregon State as the Trojans face Cal on Friday and Stanford on Sunday. While the Women of Troy are undefeated on the road, their next two games will test if they can get back on track at the Galen Center, where they are 6-6.
“I am concerned about playing at home,” head coach Mick Haley said, “because we seem to be able to focus and get organized on the road, but we haven’t done that so far at home.”
In order for the Trojans to defeat Cal, they will have to find a way to stop the Bears’ middle blocker Belen Castillo, who led her team to victory with two career-high performances last week.
“We think they are playing as well as they have all year,” Haley said. “We think they have found a pretty good lineup that works for them, so we expect a fight with the Bears.”
One of the key factors in their response will be freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier, who was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Week on Monday. Leading the team in kills, she brings an excitement to the team with her positive outlook that is infectious.
“We keep getting better every week” Lanier said. “During preseason, we were getting better and then we had a little dip, but we are building back again and working hard in the gym and are looking forward to some big upsets.”
Part of the effort put in during practice has been towards fighting against the injuries that keep happening with the team. Senior libero Taylor Whittingham is continuing to rehab her knee injury, and the middle blockers are working at staying healthy for games.
“We constantly have to manage the injuries, but there is not a standard plan,” Haley said. “You take each one as an individual and see what you can do to help them get ready as fast as they can and just be patient.”
The Trojans will have all their starters for the Cal game, Whittingham included. She has been continuing to make plays as the staple of their defense, despite focusing much of practice on rehab.
“Everyone is doing everything they can in order to get ready and my hat is off to them,” Haley said. “It is so important when you can have all 15 players adding great value to the group effort.”
With two more home games following after this weekend, the Trojans look to start off strong with a victory to give them momentum toward their next games. They will face Cal on Friday at 6 p.m. and Stanford on Sunday at 2:2 p.m. at the Galen Center.

As the panic of a weekend without USC football begins to set in, remember that even though it may not seem like it, there’s more to life than what happens in the Coliseum on Saturdays. If you are like me, you might even be glad there’s no football game this weekend. It allows you to rest up after coming out of what is the most terrifying time of any semester — midterm season.
Even though USC’s team isn’t playing this week, if you must satiate your hunger for the gridiron, there are plenty of other games to watch, including No. 1 Alabama vs. No. 6 Texas A&M or No. 17 Arkansas vs. No. 21 Auburn.
Beyond the college football world, however, this break gives other USC sports a chance to shine. The other three major fall sports — women’s volleyball, women’s soccer and men’s water polo — are all nationally ranked and definite national title contenders.
If for no other reason, there are more incentives to go to the non-revenue sports than the football games. I’ve been attending football games for three years, and two weeks ago I caught my first t-shirt that they launched into the crowd.
If you are one of the first 100 students to go to the women’s soccer game on Thursday, you get a pair of USC socks. These incentives are unfortunately what is needed to be provided in order for most of the people I know to feel like it’s a game worth attending.
Women’s soccer is an extremely popular sport in the United States (for good reason) and the USC team is exciting to watch and dominating at their level of competition. The Women of Troy (11-3) are ranked No. 5 in the country and leave no doubt with their victories.
All 11 of the team’s wins have come by two or more goals and they have held their opponents scoreless on 10 occasions. As someone who isn’t a soccer fan, I still find those numbers incredibly exciting
USC players have earned weekly conference honors six times and the team isn’t slowing down anytime soon, continually expressing how driven it is to win a national title this year. Women’s soccer isn’t the only sport that has its eyes on the prize this fall, though.
Maybe land sports aren’t your thing and that’s fine, too. The men’s water polo team probably deserves the most publicity of any team given their historic and consistent domination of the competition.
The second-best team in the country, the Trojans have lost only once this season. Sitting at 15-1, it would be easy to assume that their opponents have been cupcake teams, but that isn’t the case. The Trojans haven’t yet had to face their biggest rival, defending national champion top-ranked UCLA, but they have played (and defeated) six teams that were ranked in the top-20 when they played them. 
This impressive statistic includes five wins over teams in the top 10. In addition to their spectacular team success, there have been five weekly Pac-12 awards given to USC players.
The women’s volleyball team has one of the most dynamic young players in the conference in freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier who just this week was named the Pac-12 Freshman of the Week. Ranked No. 25 in the country, the team has suffered some disappointing losses this year, but hosts two critical matches this weekend as they face Cal on Thursday night and No. 14 Stanford on Sunday. The Women of Troy have defeated five ranked teams this season proving there is always the chance for an exciting upset.
Even though the football season is back on the right track, no one should expect to see the team ranked anywhere near the top 10 before the end of the season. The other teams representing USC, however, are on track to add to our already impressive collection of national titles. So if you want to see a truly successful team, check out a sporting event outside of the Coliseum.

USC football took to Cromwell Field for a short practice on Wednesday, as the Trojans continue to enjoy their bye week and prepare for their matchup against Cal next Thursday.
Super Special Teams
Head coach Clay Helton made a point to praise special teams coach John Baxter, whose kick and punt coverage units didn’t allow a single return yard at Arizona last week.
“There were zero return yards on 12 kicks. That means your kickers are doing a heck of a job,” Helton said. “He’s a special guy.”
Helton also credited Baxter for the progress redshirt junior kicker Matt Boermeester and redshirt sophomore punter Chris Tilbey have made this season, and Helton recalled the phone conversation he had with Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh last offseason to recruit Baxter back to Troy.
“I knew how valuable he was,” Helton said of Baxter at Michigan. “It was like stealing a good man away from another guy who you respect.”
Baxter, in return, said it was the environment while working at USC that drew him back to his old stomping grounds (he previously spent four seasons from 2010-13 with the Trojans).
“This is an incredible working environment, which is why I’m here,” he said. “Clay makes the job great.”
Baxter added that Helton’s management of his coaching staff shows what makes him a good boss.
“They let you do what you want to do, and they trust you to do it,” Baxter said. “But in exchange for that flexibility, you better return some production.”
Activating Adoree’
Helton also discussed the need to up junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson’s involvement on offense, especially since opponents are now beginning to avoid the blazing return man on kickoffs and punts, capping his scoring potential.
“I was teasing him the other day,” Helton laughed. “I said, ‘If they won’t kick it to you, we’ll need to hand it to you or throw it to you or something.’”
Nevertheless, Helton said not to expect to see too much of Jackson on offense come next Thursday, as the cornerback will likely be very occupied with his defensive duties.
“[Cal has] one of the top quarterbacks not only in our conference but in the country … so you have to be really careful about how much you use him, if at all,” Helton said.
Bear Hunt
The Trojans have begun scouting Golden Bears quarterback Davis Webb, and junior safety Chris Hawkins was concerned about the senior transfer’s big-play ability.
“He has pinpoint accuracy,” Hawkins said. “He’s No. 1 in the country in almost every QB [metric] there is.”
Helton agreed, comparing Webb to previous Cal signal caller Jared Goff, who was taken No. 1 overall by the Los Angeles Rams in the 2016 NFL Draft.
“He has Jared’s arm strength and he can make any throw on the field,” Helton said. “What I’ve been impressed with is how quickly he gets the ball out.”
Webb has run and thrown for a total of 22 touchdowns so far this fall, and the former Texas Tech Red Raider topped 300 passing yards in every game except Cal’s most recent contest: an overtime loss at Oregon State last week, when Webb departed with a hand injury.
“He’s going to try to shred us,” Hawkins said. “So we have to be on all ten toes every play.”

The first half of the USC football team’s 2016 season has been the epitome of a roller coaster ride.
The Trojans opened with a 1-3 record, which included a blowout loss to No. 1 Alabama and a heartbreaker against No. 24 Utah, but just as soon as USC followers began to reach for the guillotine for first-year head coach Clay Helton, the Trojans have since embarked on a three-game winning streak, which began with a 41-20 victory over Arizona State on Oct. 1. 
USC’s 48-14 victory over Arizona Saturday was the team’s third consecutive win and elevated the Trojans’ record above the .500 mark (4-3) for the first time this season. The winning streak has put the team back into contention for the Pac-12 South Division title and a berth to the Pac-12 Championship. 
Seven games into the regular season, the Trojans are trending upward as they enter a pivotal final stretch in their schedule that will dictate what the postseason will look like for the program. 
Darnold has sparked offense
It wouldn’t be ill-advised to say that one single name has completely changed the trajectory of the USC offense this season. That name is that of redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold, who was named the starter for the Trojans in Week 4. 
Through the first four games of the 2016 season, USC had the lowest-scoring offense in the Pac-12 (22 PPG). But since playing Utah on Sept. 23 — Darnold’s first start at quarterback — USC has averaged 527.8 yards of total offense and has scored 34.25 points per game over its last four weeks. 
After throwing for over 350 yards against Arizona State and Colorado in recent weeks, Darnold tossed five touchdown passes on Saturday against Arizona.
“What I really appreciate is [Darnold’s] humility … You throw five touchdown passes, you think you get a smile and he’s like, ‘Coach, there’s more out there,’” said Helton following the win at Arizona. “That’s what you want from your leader. He’s like his coach. He’s a perfectionist.”
Senior running back Justin Davis has been the workhorse for the Trojans on the ground thus far. Davis strung together 126-and 123-yard rushing performances against Utah and ASU, respectively, this season. In the second half against Colorado, Davis suffered a high-ankle sprain that kept him out of action against Arizona this past weekend.
In a backfield led by sophomores Aca’Cedric Ware and Ronald Jones II, USC ran for a season-high 320 yards against the Wildcats Saturday. 
After struggling early on in the season, junior receiver Juju Smith-Schuster has exploded production-wise as of late. Through the first four games of the season, Smith-Schuster averaged fewer than 50 yards receiving and five receptions per game — only scoring two touchdowns during that span.
Over USC’s last three games, Smith-Schuster has posted receiving yardage totals of 123, 113 and 132 against ASU, Colorado and Arizona, respectively. In two of the last three games, Smith-Schuster has caught three touchdown passes. 
The offensive line has battled injuries and undergone patchwork all season long. When junior center Toa Lobendahn suffered an ACL/MCL tear that ended his season early on, redshirt junior Nico Falah stepped in to fill the void. Redshirt senior tackle Zach Banner has also dealt with an ankle injury that sidelined him against ASU and Colorado.
Despite the injuries up front, players like sophomore Chuma Edoga and redshirt senior Jordan Simmons have served valuable platoon roles in providing depth for the offensive line. 
Going forward, the health and effectiveness of this Trojan offensive line will be pivotal to the continued prosperity of the offense. As the second half of USC’s schedule is one littered with strong defensive fronts.
Defense Locking Down
Much like the offense, USC’s defense has undergone a positive reversal of performance over the course of seven games. The Trojan defense has been the backbone behind the team’s current three-game winning streak. USC’s defense has held its last three opponents — ASU, Colorado, and Arizona — to an average of 17 points per game.
Against Arizona, the defense forced a total of four turnovers (two interceptions, two fumbles). 
“It’s starting to all come together for [the defense]; it’s great to get our stride going into the bye week. We get a chance to tighten up things we need to tighten up,” said senior linebacker Michael Hutchings, a team captain for USC.
After being named Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year in 2015, sophomore linebacker Cameron Smith is currently the Trojans’ leading tackler (50 this season). Against Utah, Smith tallied a season-high 15 total tackles in a losing effort. 
On the edge, sophomore linebacker Porter Gustin has been one of USC’s biggest assets in establishing a pass rush and penetrating the backfield. Gustin currently leads the team in tackles for loss (5.5) and is second in total tackles (42). 
Over the offseason, USC added redshirt senior nose tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu — a graduate transfer from Utah — to its roster. Tu’ikolovatu has been the anchor on the line that defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s “5-2” scheme calls for. 
Junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson is putting together a season worthy of consideration for the Jim Thorpe Award — an award given to the top defensive back in the nation. Jackson has intercepted two passes, recovered two fumbles and been one of the most-sure tacklers for the Trojans this season. Beyond the statistics, Jackson has been able to minimize the impact which opposing receivers have had against USC.
Sophomore cornerback Iman Marshall struggled early on in the season, getting beat and failing to convert several turnover opportunities. However Marshall has intercepted two passes now on the season — the most recent coming in the second quarter against Arizona Saturday. 
The USC defense has undergone change in narratives throughout the first half of this season. It has gone from being considered a “bend-but-don’t-break” defense, to one now that has shown an ability to suppress high-powered offenses.
Jackson leading the pac
Jackson has been the lighter fluid for the special teams unit this season. As an individual, Jackson leads the Pac-12 in both punt (15.5 yards per return) and kickoff (31.7 yards) return yardage. Jackson has returned both a kickoff and a punt return for a touchdown this season. 
Outlook
Three consecutive conference victories have put the Trojans in third in the Pac-12 South Division standings; the team trails division-leading Utah by a half-game. 
The Trojans’ last-second, 31-27 loss to the Utes has complicated their road to a division title. With Utah tied with Colorado in first place, owning the tiebreaker with USC, the Trojans will need some help from other teams now to clinch a berth to the Pac-12 Championship game. 
Following the bye week, USC will look to pick up its fourth-consecutive victory in a Thursday night contest against visiting Cal on Oct. 27. The team will then enter a crucial November which will pit the Trojans against opponents such as Oregon, No. 5 Washington, UCLA and Notre Dame. 
Should the Trojans finish the second half of the season on a strong note, there is still great opportunity for the team to clinch a spot in the Pac-12 Championship.

Millennials are some of the most socially active people, especially on the web. On average, people between the ages of 18 and 34 report that they spend three or more hours on the internet every day. Social media use adds another three hours to that total.         
Young people are among those least concerned with internet security. A 2015 study by the American Press Institute revealed that a third of our generation is not concerned about internet security. That is a worrying statistic. More than half of all millennials claim that they have encountered problems like their account being hacked or mistakenly installing malware. Unsurprisingly, most millennials claim to want additional internet security to protect their information. In response, half of millennials use customized privacy settings on social media websites, and some claim to go out of their way to limit the amount of personal information they share with others online. However, most millennials do not go far enough to protect themselves online.
They make sparse use of some of the most effective tools for securing their internet browsing and personal information. Things like antivirus software, virtual private networks, IP address masking and browser plug-ins that obscure personal information each nets the use of a minimal number of millennials. Most of the strategies detailed above see use by less than 20 percent of our generation. Coincidentally, this percentage correlates with the proportion of millennials who worry “most of the time” about security, according to the American Press Institute study.
Millennials should take online security seriously. The online realm is not as safe as some seem to think. The danger of malware is not restrained to getting a virus that exclusively causes pop-ups every time you open a web browser. Online identity theft is frighteningly common. Bank account fraud can cause substantial financial losses. Spyware can let a complete stranger know your most intimate personal details and behavioral habits just by observing your online activity. There are criminal threats all over the web to unsuspecting surfers.
The problems do not end there, though. Future employers, graduate schools and even prosecutors oftentimes use an individual’s online profiles to learn more about the person they are studying. It goes without saying that this can have disastrous consequences for those who are not concerned with their internet privacy or security. A cover letter shows someone at their presumed best; an embarrassing, drunken Facebook post shows an applicant at their worst. Employers, professors and prosecutors want to know the kind of people they are dealing with, and although many people have skeletons in their closets, most are competent enough to keep them in there. Many millennials, it seems, are content to let them tumble out into an embarrassing heap in front of anyone with enough curiosity to enter their name into a search engine.
Furthermore, web-based corporations can sell information about you to other companies or individuals. Advertisers, for example, use this data to tailor advertisements to certain demographics based on their browsing activity and behavioral trends. To be clear, this is not information that you are deliberately and expressly choosing to give, piece by piece, to a singular individual. This is passive, mass-data collection that feeds your individual habits into a processor, which spits out individualized information based on who the program thinks you are. The processor is not always correct, but it is deeply concerning that this information is being sold, oftentimes without your express knowledge and only with implicit consent, by operators of the websites you visit.
A journalist from TIME Magazine gave a CEO of a web-based reputation website his name and email address. Within hours, he was called back by the company and was read his Social Security Number. This example illustrates that, without proper safeguards, even an individual’s most intimate personal information can be discovered and manipulated online. The people you email, the friends you hang out with most, the places you like to get coffee or a late-night meal — these are all things that can be discovered through relatively simple means if one does not make an effort to obscure them. We belong to the generation that came of age with the internet. But the millennial generation should not be known as the one that was blinded by the internet’s conveniences.
The dangers of irresponsible internet use are not only personal. In 2007, the United States government demonstrated that an industrial power generator could be instructed to destroy itself by manipulating its computer code.

Millennials are some of the most socially active people, especially on the web. On average, people between the ages of 18 and 34 report that they spend three or more hours on the internet every day. Social media use adds another three hours to that total.         
Young people are among those least concerned with internet security. A 2015 study by the American Press Institute revealed that a third of our generation is not concerned about internet security. That is a worrying statistic. More than half of all millennials claim that they have encountered problems like their account being hacked or mistakenly installing malware. Unsurprisingly, most millennials claim to want additional internet security to protect their information. In response, half of millennials use customized privacy settings on social media websites, and some claim to go out of their way to limit the amount of personal information they share with others online. However, most millennials do not go far enough to protect themselves online.
They make sparse use of some of the most effective tools for securing their internet browsing and personal information. Things like antivirus software, virtual private networks, IP address masking and browser plug-ins that obscure personal information each nets the use of a minimal number of millennials. Most of the strategies detailed above see use by less than 20 percent of our generation. Coincidentally, this percentage correlates with the proportion of millennials who worry “most of the time” about security, according to the American Press Institute study.
Millennials should take online security seriously. The online realm is not as safe as some seem to think. The danger of malware is not restrained to getting a virus that exclusively causes pop-ups every time you open a web browser. Online identity theft is frighteningly common. Bank account fraud can cause substantial financial losses. Spyware can let a complete stranger know your most intimate personal details and behavioral habits just by observing your online activity. There are criminal threats all over the web to unsuspecting surfers.

No it shouldn’t.  Just because it’s your priority, doesn’t mean it needs to be anyone else’s.  We have no privacy now, nor have we for at least a decade, and what have been the repercussions?  Oh no!  Amazon knows I was at Starbucks!  Oh no!  The NSA knows I had a tomato sandwich for lunch!

Perhaps it’s just because Trump has been slipping in the polls. Or perhaps it’s because people feel genuine disillusionment with our political system. Whatever the reason may be, anxieties over voting — who can vote, who should vote, is voting fraud happening — seemed to be at an all-time high this week. While instances like satirist Randy Dub posing as a post office worker and tweeting that he loves “ripping up absentee ballots that vote for trump” did not do much to calm fears that voter fraud is occurring at high levels, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump himself has been a major proponent of the myth that this election is rigged. Trump’s claims, like the one in which he blamed immigrants for voter fraud, combined with a viral hashtag campaign to repeal the 19th Amendment, should be a cause for concern. According to FiveThirtyEight, Hillary Clinton has a 92 percent chance of winning the election as of Oct. 18. However, Clinton supporters should be worried by the rhetoric about voting being pushed by Trump and his supporters.
President Barack Obama linked Trump’s accusations to his ability to serve in office, saying “If whenever things are going badly for you and you lose you start blaming somebody else, then you don’t have what it takes to be in this job.” While Trump’s “whining”, as Obama calls it, may be the mark of a poor loser, it is also dangerous. A key component of any healthy, stable democracy is the ability to have a smooth and peaceful transition of power. Even after the hotly contested Supreme Court decision in Bush v. Gore, most people accepted, however resentfully, that George W. Bush was President of the United States. Trump’s claims of “widespread” voter fraud, then, should be concerning, especially considering calls to limit who can vote are resonating with his supporters.
After The New York Times, FiveThirtyEight released a picture of what the electoral college would look like if only women voted, a hashtag campaign #RepealThe19th went viral. The 19th amendment, which granted white women the right to vote in 1920, was the subject of much derision and virulent rhetoric when it was being debated in the early 20th century. However, the very idea that people, even if only a vocal minority, would challenge the right of women to vote in 2016 is shocking — though not out of line with other offensive rhetoric typical of Trump and his supporters.
Perhaps even more worrying than the hashtag campaign, however, is Trump’s call to have supporters “watch other communities, because we don’t want this election stolen from us.” It is impossible to ignore the parallels between this and the systemic voter intimidation that historically took place across America. And Trump’s supporters are more than willing to answer his call. Two Trump supporters held a 12-hour open carry protest outside a Democratic campaign office in Virginia. Dan Bowman, a Trump supporter interviewed by the Wall Street Journal, said, “I’ll do everything in my power to take [Clinton] out of power.” When asked to clarify if that was a threat Bowman replied, “What do you think a patriot is?”
            Regardless of the likelihood that Trump will become president, a major political candidate challenging the credibility of the election and calling on supporters to engage in vigilante intimidation should not be tolerated. Even if Trump loses the presidency, the rhetoric of a “rigged” election could cast a shadow over the election regardless of the outcome.

I never understood why the same sanctimonious people decrying racism when legislation is pushed for requiring photo ID to vote, are not angry with the travel industry for requiring photo ID to fly on a plane.
New Black Panthers thugs standing in a polling station with baseball bats in Philly is not part of voter fraud?
DNC not supporting voter photo ID does nothing to instill any confidence in a system since you cant buy a beer without a photo ID…DNC paying people to riot and attack at Trump rally in Chicago…come on, wake up America!
The exclamations of one kook and a couple of rank partisans don’t make voter fraud a myth.

For those that haven’t been keeping track of the auto industry recently, it has become clear that autonomous vehicles will be a part of the future of mass transportation in this country. This view has been greatly bolstered by the September release of the first United States government guidelines on autonomous vehicles, which broadly outline standards for their use on U.S. roads.
It is important to note that this document, officially named The Federal Automated Vehicles Policy, does not contain official regulations. Instead, it is a step which indicates that the federal government is preparing to regulate autonomous vehicles on a national scale in the future. It stands to reason that the U.S. government does not yet have the information needed to craft official laws and does not want to overregulate this developing industry for fear of hindering growth.
An encouraging sign for future autonomous vehicle safety is that the document includes a section which emphasizes concerns about an autonomous system’s “Ethical Considerations”. These ethical issues are at the center of research done by Professor Jeffrey Miller, an autonomous vehicle expert at the USC Department of Computer Science. 
Professor Miller’s research addresses issues like the hypothetical Moose Problem. In this scenario two autonomous cars are traveling fast, side-by-side, along a narrow road when one car’s sensors suddenly detect that a full-grown moose has jumped onto the road in front of it. There are only 2 possible scenarios: the car hits the moose and the moose’s weight kills its passenger, or the car swerves into its neighboring car and pushes it off the road, killing those passengers instead. This scenario poses a key question: should an autonomous vehicle preserve the life of its passenger at any cost, even if it requires harming others? Or should it make certain concessions, even if that means that the car’s passenger may get hurt? 
“Driverless vehicles need to know ahead of time what decision to make since they can’t instantaneously revert control to the driver for input” said Miller.  “These ethical dilemmas need to be considered during development so the vehicle can be programmed to behave in that manner when a situation arises.” It’s clear that the groundwork for framing, studying, and addressing these important ethical consideration is being laid here at USC.
While we see that the government is now planning to enact laws that require autonomous systems to account for ethically challenging situations, the new policy document provides no specific recommendations for addressing or even considering these problems. It does mention that the algorithms tasked with resolving such conflicts should “be developed transparently using input from Federal and State regulators, drivers, passengers, and vulnerable road users,” which seems to imply that a wealth of data will soon be needed. In a move signaling progress on the state-level, California’s DMV released guidelines supporting the federal document on September 30th and more states are sure to follow. 
Research on developing ethically acceptable AI, like the kind conducted by Miller, may soon be at the center of a national debate on the future of our transportation system. Only adding to the hysteria, Uber has recently begun using autonomous vehicle to pick up actual customers around its research center in Pittsburg and they may soon launch the same program in San Francisco. It seems we’ve only begun to hear the debate on autonomous cars and how their system will be designed.
