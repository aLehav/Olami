Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler and junior kicker Andre Heidari were named the Pac-12’s Offensive and Special Teams Players of the Week, respectively, on Monday following their impressive performances in USC’s 20-17 upset victory over Stanford.
Heidari connected on a 47-yard field goal with 19 seconds remaining to clinch USC’s win. Prior to Saturday’s game, the Bakersfield, Calif. native had come under scrutiny after missing several field goals in USC losses this season, but Heidari was able to redeem himself against Stanford.
Interim head coach Ed Orgeron surprisingly decided to play for the field goal late in the game and showed an unexpected amount of trust for his struggling kicker by sending him onto the field in the biggest game of the year for the Trojans.
Heidari also made a short field goal that gave the Trojans a 10-point lead in the second quarter.
Kessler was 25-for-37 for 288 yards and a touchdown on Saturday. He controlled the offense from start to finish, and was able to keep his composure in the face of the mounting Stanford pressure from their vaunted front seven.
On the season, Kessler has now thrown for 2,265 yards with 13 touchdown passes and just six interceptions. His completion percentage of 64.7 percent is the fourth-best in the Pac-12.
Redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey was also nominated for defensive player of the week. Bailey had a critical interception in the fourth quarter after Stanford had advanced the ball to the USC 10-yard line. Bailey picked off Stanford quarterback Kevin Hogan’s pass and returned it to the USC 34-yard line. It was Bailey’s fourth interception of the season, tying him for the team lead with freshman safety Su’a Cravens.
The Trojans continue play this weekend against the Colorado Buffaloes, and are still in contention for the Pac-12 South title.

The women’s tennis team will welcome two new players for the 2014-2015 season since Gabrielle Smith and Madison Westby signed national letters of intent, head coach Richard Gallien and associate head coach West Nott said on Monday.
Smith attended Coronado High School in Henderson, Nev., where she ranked in the top 10 in the nation and earned three Silver Balls and four Bronze Balls. In her freshman year, she earned the title of Nevada 4A individual champion.
A Tulsa, Okla. native, Westby will graduate from Bishop Kelley High School, where she was a three-time state champion and earned a career-high ranking of 13 in the nation. She recently won the singles title at an ITA international tournament in Waco, Texas and was the singles and doubles champion at a USTA tournament in St. Louis, Mo. The 2013 Missouri Valley Player of the Year earned one Silver Ball in doubles.
Smith and Westby look to contribute to a team that completed a successful fall season, with different players stepping up each week for tournament competition.
Newcomers this season freshman Zoë Katz and senior Brynn Boren, who transferred from Tennessee, performed well in their first season with the Women of Troy, reaching the finals in the ITA Regionals before falling to UCLA. In singles, Boren also led the Women of Troy as the runner-up of the tournament.
Senior Kaitlyn Christian and junior Sabrina Santamaria have proved themselves as a dominant duo in doubles play, coming off of a national championship win in the 2012-2013 season. The pair was ranked No. 1 in the nation by ITA but fell in the semifinals of the regional tournament.
The Women of Troy will return to the court for the ITF Florida Open on Jan. 17.

USC sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams is one of 22 players to earn a spot on the midseason watch list for the 2013 Ted Hendricks Award, according to an update based on games through Saturday.
Unstoppable · USC sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams has recorded 63 tackles and a team-leading 11 tackles for loss this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The criteria for the award, which is given to a defensive end of any class standing at an NCAA accredited school, include on-field performance, leadership ability, contributions to respective schools and communities, academic performance and exceptional winning attitude.
Williams is joined by fellow Pac-12 defensive players Josh Mauro of Stanford, Scott Crichton of Oregon State, Tony Washington of Oregon and Chidera Uzo-Diribe of Colorado.
The list is open to additions and deletions until Nov. 25, when the selection committee takes its first vote to narrow down the list to 4 to 6 finalists. The committee will vote a second time to choose this season’s winner, who will be announced on Dec. 11.
At 6-foot-5 and 290 lbs., Williams leads the Trojans with 11 tackles for a loss. He also has five sacks and 63 tackles, both good for second-most on the team.
In USC’s upset victory over Stanford, Williams recorded seven tackles and one fumble recovery.
This season, Williams was also named a semifinalist for the 2013 Chuck Bednarik Award for outstanding defensive player of the year.
In 2012, the Daytona Beach, Fla. native was named Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year and made the Football Writers, Sporting News, Scout.com, CollegeFootballNews.com and Phil Steele Freshman All-American first teams, in addition to All-Pac-12 honorable mention. He debuted as a defensive tackle before moving to end this season and played in all 13 games of 2012, starting in nine.

You don’t truly realize just how early 2:45 a.m. is until you notice people returning home from a late night out just as you are starting your day. In the wee hours of Saturday morning, more than a few night owls sauntered through the courtyard at the University Gateway apartment building after what I can only assume was a particularly lively evening.
Welcome back · The atmosphere in the student section during USC’s dramatic 20-17 victory over Stanford helped signify USC’s success in the national spotlight and made Saturday’s 3 a.m. wake-up call a wise decision. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
For members of the Trojan Knights, a student organization founded in 1921 that serves as the premiere spirit organization of USC, the day is just getting started. Though the group lends its support to all of USC’s athletic teams and participates in numerous charitable endeavors, the Knights are renowned for their ties with USC football. At each home game, the Knights sit in the front row of the student section and paint their bodies with a message of support for the team.
I joined the Trojan Knights during the fall semester of 2012, and on Saturday I made my debut as a gameday painter. I opted for the Stanford game because I thought it would be the most fun game to watch from the student section, but I must admit that I had no idea just how eventful Saturday would end up being.
Because of ESPN’s College GameDay’s presence on campus, there were two painting sessions: one for the morning show that began airing live at 6 a.m. and one for the actual game. Seeing as this would be my only opportunity of the season to paint, I decided to do both, which meant that I had a long day ahead of me. I met up with a group of about 15 other Knights in preparation for GameDay, and I can say that if I wasn’t fully awake when I got there, I was jolted out of my drowsiness as soon as the first brush of ice-cold paint was laid on.
We started painting at 3 a.m. and left for McCarthy Quad around 4:30 a.m. The program was mostly uneventful and mainly consisted of us trying to stay warm while standing in the cold with no shirts on, but we received a huge boost of excitement when ESPN analyst Lee Corso stunned the crowd by picking USC to pull off the upset.
After GameDay ended and the six-hour morning portion of the day concluded, a two-hour power nap was definitely in order. We reconvened at noon to begin preparation for the game, and headed to the stadium at 2 p.m. From then until kickoff, we helped set up the student section with pom-poms and card stunt instructions, which was a far more tedious task than I had expected and sapped what little energy remained after a lack of sleep.
But as fans began to pour into the stadium, excitement started to build. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was packed for the first time all season, and the vibe around the stadium suggested that this would be a memorable night. In what was once perceived as a woeful, lost season after former head coach Lane Kiffin’s firing, the fact that this game was deemed important enough to be given a primetime 5 p.m. kickoff and be broadcast by ABC was an accomplishment in itself.
The buildup to this game was unlike anything I had witnessed during my time as a USC student, and once the game began, the student section was as electric as I have ever seen it. In Stanford’s first drive of the game, the crowd noise forced the Cardinal to burn two timeouts and commit a false-start penalty, which only fueled the fans to cheer even louder.
There were a season’s worth of highlight reel-worthy plays in this game that sent the crowd into a frenzy. Redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey’s interception in the fourth quarter drew perhaps the biggest reaction, at least until the game-winning 47-yard field goal by embattled junior kicker Andre Heidari. I must admit that as Heidari jogged onto the field, the majority of the fans around me were preparing for the game to go into overtime, and I felt the same way. But Heidari’s kick couldn’t have been more perfect, and I’ve never been happier to admit that I was wrong.
When the clock finally hit zeros, nearly 18 hours after waking up, it hit me that what I had witnessed was much more than an upset over a top-five ranked rival. Given the circumstances, this was one of the most meaningful wins for USC in the past decade. For a team that’s been decimated by injuries and NCAA sanctions, a team that seemed destined to underachieve yet again after dismissing its head coach, this win meant much more than simply a boost in the conference standings. ABC sportscaster Brent Musburger said it best after the win was sealed when he proclaimed, “The Trojans are relevant again.”
The win over Stanford gave fans who had endured a dismal 7-6 2012 season and some hard-to-watch low points of this season a reward for sticking around. I have seen fans storm the field on TV before, but I had never witnessed a field storming in person until Saturday. What struck me most about it was that fans came onto the field from all directions, not just from the student section. That speaks to the dedication of the Trojan Family, something that sounds a bit cliche but was proven to be anything but on Saturday.
As students began to storm the field, I waited and watched as the scrum in the middle of the field grew bigger. I realized that what was probably the longest, most exhausting day of my life also was the most fun, exciting and rewarding experience of my college career. In what will end up being my final football game watching from the student section, the Trojans did not disappoint, and as interim head coach Ed Orgeron said to his players after the game, this will be a night that will always be remembered.

Following its upset victory over Stanford, USC will attempt to avoid a letdown this week as it heads to Boulder, Colo. to take on the Colorado Buffaloes. The Trojans are 7-0 all-time against Colorado, including a dominant 50-6 victory last season at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. In USC’s last trip to Boulder in 2011, the Trojans won 42-17.

Stanford Takeaways
There were plenty of positives to reflect on from USC’s win over Stanford. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler delivered one of his best performances of the season on Saturday, throwing for 288 yards and one touchdown with no interceptions.
“He’s improved his fundamentals, his confidence, the way he runs the offense [and] his moxie,” interim head coach Ed Orgeron said. “We believe in him. We love him.”
Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee also delivered a solid performance, hauling in six catches for 83 yards and showing his toughness and resolve late in the fourth quarter.
Lee limped off the field in the fourth quarter after apparently re-injuring his knee, but summoned his strength to come back for one final play: a 13-yard reception on fourth-and-2 that eventually led to junior kicker Andre Heidari’s game-winning field goal.
Lee was helped off the field after his catch and was carted to the locker room after the game among the thousands of fans who rushed the field.
“The fortitude of Marqise Lee was tremendous,” Orgeron said. “He wanted to make that play, and these guys have been tremendous and there’s just a team unity.”
Bring on the Buffs
After the biggest win of the season so far, the Trojans must now shift their focus to the reeling Colorado Buffaloes.
The Buffaloes (4-6, 1-6 Pac-12) are coming into the matchup with some momentum after a 41-24 blowout win over California that gave them their first conference win of the season. Quarterback Sefo Liufau, who assumed the starting job for the Buffaloes midway through the season, threw for 364 yards in the win against the Bears. Liufau is averaging 225 yards per game and has racked up eight touchdowns and six interceptions on the season.
Liufau’s favorite target has been wide receiver Paul Richardson, who averages 120.1 yards per game, good for fourth in the nation.
Colorado struggled last season, finishing with a 1-11 record, but has improved under first-year head coach Mike MacIntyre.
“They look like a lot better team than last year,” Orgeron said.
The game against the Buffaloes falls between an emotional win against Stanford and the final regular-season game against crosstown rival UCLA, but Orgeron insists that the Trojans will stay disciplined and focus on the task at hand.
“We stick to the process. One day at a time,” Orgeron said of his practice plans for the week. “We’ll have a great week of practice and play well on Saturday.”
Don’t know Jack
Since taking over as interim head coach, Orgeron has led the Trojans to a 5-1 record after former head coach Lane Kiffin started the season 3-2. Saturday’s upset over Stanford marked the peak of public support for Orgeron, as evidenced by the popularization of the hashtag #HireCoachO on Twitter and the creation of a “Hire Coach O” website.
Given Orgeron’s recent success, the news that Athletic Director Pat Haden had interviewed current Denver Broncos defensive coordinator and interim head coach and former USC linebacker Jack Del Rio for a head coaching position during the Broncos’ recent bye week came as a surprise to many Trojan fans.
Del Rio was an All-American linebacker at USC and the co-MVP of the 1985 Rose Bowl. He also played baseball for the Trojans.
Before joining the Broncos’ coaching staff, Del Rio was head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars for eight-and-a-half seasons, where he posted a 69-72 record.
Del Rio’s name had been in the mix of potential head coaches since Kiffin was fired, along with Vanderbilt head coach James Franklin and Texas A&M head coach Kevin Sumlin. Last month, reports surfaced that USC would be willing to make its next head coach the highest-paid in the nation, with a salary of $6 million.

The USC men’s basketball team will look to continue its success at the Galen Center and earn its third straight win against Cal State Fullerton tonight at 8 p.m.
Leading the way · USC junior guard Byron Wesley is averaging a team-high 20.7 points and 9.3 rebounds per game this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (2-1) have found success at home under first-year coach Andy Enfield, having won their first two contests at the Galen Center. After a 95-79 win in their home opener against Cal State Northridge, USC had a harder time dispatching Northern Arizona (1-2), having to recover from 12-point deficits in both the first and second halves to beat the Lumberjacks 67-63. Junior guard Byron Wesley was the only USC player in double digits, setting a career-high with 31 points and leading the team with 9 rebounds.
Despite the team’s uneven performance, players understand that in the early part of the season, the main objective is simply to get better each game.
“I don’t expect us to peak early,” senior guard J.T. Terrell said. “If we start to peak around conference, then I would say we’re pretty much where we need to be.”
Freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic finished with 9 points and 6 rebounds against NAU, while senior center Omar Oraby, who hit the go-ahead layup with 54 seconds left, added 8 points and 7 rebounds. NAU guards Aaseem Dixon and Quinton Upshur both set career highs with 20 and 18 points, respectively,
Through three games this season, Wesley has averaged a team-leading 20.7 points and 9.3 rebounds per game, while also averaging 3.7 assists per game, second on the team. Oraby averages 13.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game on the season, while Terrell is averaging 10 points per game after scoring 2 points on 0-6 shooting in 17 minutes against the Lumberjacks.
“We’re getting better still, trying to make strides every day in practice,” Wesley said. “I think it comes down to toughness. Rebounding and defense is something that you will yourself to do, so if guys just start playing hard consistently and continue to get tougher and get better every day, we should be fine.”
Cal State Fullerton (2-1) is coming off an 86-73 win over Santa Clara. The Titans, boosted by guard Alex Harris’ 19 points, led by as many as 24 in the second half, but a late rally from the Broncos cut the deficit to 13.
Harris leads four double-digit scorers for the Titans with 17.7 points per game. Guard Michael Williams averages 15.3 points per game, while forward Marquis Horne averages 13.3 points and guard Josh Gentry is averaging 10 points per game.
“They’re an excellent basketball team with a great coach,” Enfield said about the Titans. “They have unbelievable guards. They shoot the ball, they penetrate, and whenever you have three guys that can play like that, any team’s difficult to defend. We have to do a good job of containing the guards and then making plays at the other end.”
The last contest between the Trojans and the Titans was an 81-54 win for USC on Nov. 24, 2010 at the Galen Center. Nikola Vucevic (16 points, 14 rebounds) and Alex Stephenson (11 points, 12 rebounds) both picked up double-doubles, Maurice Jones led the team with 20 points (17 in the second half), and Bryce Jones added 15 points. USC is 3-0 all-time against Cal State Fullerton.
The Trojans will conclude their homestand on Thursday at 7 p.m. against West Alabama (1-1). They will then travel to the Bahamas for the Battle 4 Atlantis Tournament, taking on Villanova on Nov. 28 at 10 a.m.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Saturday, Nov. 16, and Sunday, Nov. 17. 
Crimes against persons
at 2:03 A.m. on Nov. 16, DPS officers responded to a report of two students involved in an altercation at Pi Beta Phi and detained them for investigation. During questioning, one of the students admitted that he punched the other student in the eye, but the second student did not want criminal prosecution of the matter. Both subjects were subsequently released.
at 2:58 p.m. on Nov. 16, a staff member reported that she was involved in a confrontation with a former student outside the Physical Education building and the subject subsequently posted a threatening statement on her social media page.
Crimes against property
at 3:17 p.m. on Nov. 16, two non-USC males were struck by a branch that fell from a tree outside Bovard Auditorium. Both of the males sustained injuries, so a Los Angeles Fire Department RA unit was requested. RA Unit #24 responded and treated the males, then one of them was transported to California Hospital for additional medical treatment.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 3:00 a.m. on Nov. 16, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated student who was observed standing naked near Jefferson Boulevard and Royal Street. The student was incoherent when contacted by the officers, so a Los Angeles Fire Department RA unit was requested. RA Unit #14 responded and examined the student, then transported him to Kaiser Hospital for medical treatment.

United States Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs Evan Ryan discussed her role at the agency at an event on Monday in the Social Sciences Building.
Jay Wang, director of the USC Center of Public Diplomacy, began the event by introducing Ryan. Ryan assumed her position as assistant secretary of state on Sept. 26. Previously, she served in the White House as assistant to the vice president and special assistant to the president for intergovernmental affairs and public engagement.
The visit to USC was Ryan’s first stop outside of the state department. Ryan began the conversation by introducing what the ECA does and what it is responsible for.
“The ECA oversees international exchange programs — cultural, professional and academic. We have about 140 exchange programs of different kinds,” Evans said. “Through these programs, we have about 300,000 foreigners coming into the United States every year.”
The ECA’s mission statement is to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries through educational and cultural exchanges that support the development of peaceful relations.
“We are sharing American values around the world, to develop individual skills for people to return to their home country with enhanced skill bases, in order to lift up their communities and countries,” Ryan said.
Ryan said the ECA also tries to reach out to new and diverse communities.
“A huge goal for us is trying to reach people who may have never previously met someone from the U.S.,” she said. “Those are the audiences we are trying to expand to — the nontraditional people for these exchange programs.”
Ryan also spoke about different exchange programs through the ECA. For example, there is a Fulbright-mtvU program for students who are more interested in music.
“A Fulbright-mtvU fellow developed a band of Palestinians and Israelis. They travel around and perform,” Ryan said. “It’s a really rare partnership between Israelis and Palestinians and it’s based on music. It is really a heartening thing to see.”
The second half of the conversation with Ryan consisted of a Q&A session.
Students who were at the meeting with Ryan had differing opinions about it. Many were excited to learn more about the United States’ diplomatic efforts.
“I came into the conversation without knowing much about what she does and the program. It was really interesting to hear all these international efforts to create better relationships,” said Cindy Barrios, a senior majoring in East Asian area studies.
Some students said they were interested to learn exactly what diplomacy means.
“Public diplomacy is one of those things that everyone has heard of but it’s also something no one can define exactly,” said Luke Phillips, a sophomore majoring in international relations. “It’s refreshing going to an event where all they do is talk about it. It’s amazing to know that by working for the state department for this group, you can plan events while serving your country and serving the interests of peace and freedom for the rest of the world.”
Other students, however, thought Ryan should have focused her speech on more practical matters.
“It’s definitely interesting to listen; it’s rare that you get to hear directly firsthand, sitting in a room,” said Nona Yegazarian, a senior majoring in business administration. “At the same time, it’s not new. We already understand what diplomacy is. I wanted to hear about the actual problems and how they’re working to overcome them.”

A team from the Marshall School of Business placed third in the final round of the Ericsson Networked Society Cities Case Competition last weekend in Miami Beach, Fla. — representing not only USC but also the United States.
In its first year, the international case competition, which spanned from July to November, was sponsored by Ericsson, a technology company focused on information and communications technology (ICT).
Teams are composed of three students, two of whom must be enrolled in an MBA program at the same university. Representing USC are three MBA students within the Marshall School of Business: Ketan Chaudhry, Joe Jackiewicz and Tim Kline.
During the four-day final round at Ericsson’s Networked Society Forum, the USC team had the opportunity to network with Ericsson executives as well as other industry executives including Verizon CEO Lowell C. McAdam and Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales. They were given the details of their specific case Sunday afternoon, with only 24 hours to determine a solution.
USC competed against three other teams. IAE Argentina, placed first, Indian Institute of Management Calcutta came in second and Tallinn University of Technology came in fourth.
Team member Ketan Chaudhry said he saw the competition as an opportunity to make real changes.
“How can we change society or change cities around the world using ICT not just today, but 15 years hence, 20 years hence, 25 years hence?” Chaudhry asked.
To reach the final round of competition, the USC team competed in three earlier rounds. Starting at a Silicon Valley regional competition in San Jose, Calif., USC competed against universities including UC Irvine, UC Berkeley and Stanford University. USC placed first in this round, with Stanford coming in second.
At the competition, the team was presented with a problem in regards to transportation and had to create a solution utilizing ICT. As a USC group, the team said it was a no-brainer to choose Los Angeles as its focus city.
Kline said he believes the challenges the team faced were made easier because each team member played to his strengths, especially in the second and third rounds.
“We know each other well enough that we’re able to take criticism well and understand that we’re playing devil’s advocate for each other’s ideas so they can be a lot more clearly researched and executed by the time we’re finished,” he said.
The second round of competition emphasized a global perspective. The USC team competed against 15 teams from around the world. Instead of being location-based, the competition was remote. Teams submitted a three-page summary that addressed the problem and a suggested solution. The USC group chose Mumbai, India because it believed governance was disconnected from citizen engagement there.
After qualifying, the teams gave a Skype presentation to a panel of judges who questioned the team on their submitted report for 45 minutes. The team members were asked questions about their suggestion, which eventually led them to the final round of four teams.
The solutions the teams suggested were not meant to remain on paper but expected to be legitimate suggestions that Ericsson could use in the future, Jackiewicz said.
“We really want to open up a new revenue stream, a new opportunity to engage with their customers,” he said. “I think it’s definitely possible that these things could become a reality. The key is for us to communicate our enthusiasm and show how much potential this project has and for them to take advantage of it.”
Marshall case competition teams are chosen through an application process that full-time MBA students can apply to.
“They have not only as a team been very successful but they’re really helping to build the Marshall brand and the USC brand by putting so much effort and time into this competition and really spending the time and making their recommendations as strong as they have to get to this point,” said Anne Ziemniak, associate director of the full-time MBA program.
The competition culminated last night with the finalists presenting their complete presentation to network and industry executives.
The team members felt positive about their experience in Miami Beach and hope they represented USC well.
“My personal strategy is that I look at it like we’ve already won,” Kline said before the results were announced. “We got there to the final four.”

Behrokh Khoshnevis, a professor of industrial and systems engineering and civil and environmental engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering, has recently developed Contour Crafting, a technology to build structures with much thicker layers than the usual type of 3-D printing.
The technology, which Khoshnevis has devoted 15 years to creating, could make building houses utilizing 3-D printers a possibility.
“It is a hundred times faster and it gets smooth surfaces,” Khoshnevis said, holding up one of his models.
The robotic construction system has completed the printing of 6-foot-tall sections of homes in Khoshnevis’ lab.
The invention has already received a favorable reception from NASA. Khoshnevis has received a grant from the organization to begin applying his Contour Crafting system to build structures on the moon and Mars.
Khoshnevis said that though he started with the simple idea of 3-D house printing, he has gone through a great deal of trial and error in developing Contour Crafting. For example, he said he spent years trying to solve the issue of pumping concrete from ground level up to the large robotic machine while making sure it retained its viscosity.
But Khoshnevis said he’s grateful for the problem that came up.
“It shows something that you haven’t thought about,” he said. “It shows something new and you really don’t know what the outcome will be. It shows the potential to move forward.”
The expense of transporting the construction material to the moon will cost as much as $200,000 per kilogram, Khoshnevis said. He believes this high expense will push Contour Crafting technology onto a new level.
Khoshnevis has already run some tests using soil from Mars, which he found to be rich with sulfur. He invented a new machine in order to replace water with sulfur to bind the soil.
Khoshnevis believes construction on the moon, however, will have certain benefits.
“It’s to our advantage. … The building doesn’t have to be as strong [because gravity is one-sixth what it is on Earth],” he said.
Once the technology has proven itself, Khoshnevis said landing and departure pads, shelters and even homes could be constructed on other planets.
“I am fascinated by the idea of creativity and invention,” he said. “This is the most exciting path in life, to keep doing things that nobody has done.”
He is now anticipating a certificate to use Contour Crafting technology to print a real building. The building will take less time and cost less money than regularly constructed buildings. It will also save numerous human resources.
“You are taking a good human being with potential of creating and you are pushing him into repeated work. For me that is a crime,” Khoshnevis said.
Once Contour Crafting technology is applied into mass production,” Khoshnevis said. “The construction industry will experience drastic change.”
With the help of colleagues and the support from family, Khoshnevis said he is enjoying the journey itself. He said that his unprecedented work is what defines him.
“The mission of humanity is to expand what’s going on and we have to push our civilization forward,” he said. “Everyone should make a difference.”
 
Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article said transportation of the construction material could cost up to $200,000. The sentence should have read that the transportation of the construction material could cost up to $200,000 per kilogram.  The article has been edited online to reflect this change.

In the face of the impending global food security crisis, one student is working toward a lasting solution. Sanjay Rajpoot, set to graduate from USC this December with degrees in physics and chemical and nanotechnology engineering, has big plans in store for his company, Sustainable Microfarms, and its developments, which could change the way people farm.
In addition to advocating sustainable growing, Rajpoot and the Sustainable Microfarms team hope to extend their reach into underdeveloped regions hit hardest by famines, such as India, China and Africa. Sustainable Microfarms suggests hydroponics — growing crops in water instead of soil — as the most effective mode of farming in varying environments with varying resources.
“Hydroponics allows people to farm without the environmental constraints that come with soil,” Rajpoot said. “The awesome part is, you can control what is put into the water, all the way down to the sulfur content. You can make food nutritious and organic without worrying about environmental factors ruining your crop.”
Depleted soils from overfarming pose a great challenge to industrial agriculture, especially in conjunction with the growing world population. Hydroponics, on the other hand, offers a farming solution that requires 90 percent less water, 70 percent fewer nutrients and anywhere from 10 to 30 times the yield of a conventionally-farmed crop.
As a sophomore, Rajpoot was involved in a research project with USC biological sciences assistant professor Myrna Jacobson, which originally sparked his interest in agricultural technology. He later was introduced to General Hydroponics founder Lawrence Brooke, who exposed him to the inner workings of the industry. Rajpoot said he saw hydroponics becoming transformative in the agriculture industry, but that he thought changes would have to be made first — contemporary hydroponic methods were too tedious and costly.
“In conventional hydroponics, you have to constantly check the pH and plant food levels in the reservoir; if anything changes, you need to break out the graduated cylinders and remeasure,” Rajpoot said. “We worked on a product that eliminates the need for constant monitoring and dosing.”
Rajpoot and his team, including some of his brothers from the fraternity Theta Xi, participated in and won engineering competitions at USC, California Institute of Technology, Yum! Brands and the Dept. of Energy. In addition, the Kairos Society selected the Sustainable Microfarms team for a fellowship, which allowed them to pitch their prototype to high net-worth investors at the New York Stock Exchange, allowing them to grow their network and bankroll themselves as an official corporation.
With their newfound capital and connections, Rajpoot and his engineers created the Genesis Controller, a system that comes with preprogrammed algorithms to monitor pH and nutrient levels in hydroponic reservoirs by depositing nutrient solutions. The product, whose inventors boast will ensure that home growers won’t ever again need a chemistry degree to get started in hydroponics, is the first tangible step in Rajpoot’s vision of individualized sustainable farming.
After recent success with their Indiegogo fundraiser for the Genesis Controller, which is now in its initial stages of distribution, Sustainable Microfarms is planning to undertake more capital investment ventures to fund large-scale developments for companies such as Amway and Home Town Farms.
“Naturally, not everyone will want to or be able to farm at home, so we must cater to large markets as well,” Rajpoot said. “We will raise more funds for engineering and business development to build products to make industrial farming more efficient in terms of water usage.”
As for his success in the business world, Rajpoot credits USC with keeping him well-connected and well-rounded.
“USC has been a crucial part in my success. I got really lucky because I had an amazing host of mentors while being at USC,” Rajpoot said. “A lot of my time was spent on theoretical work in labs, but I was exposed to both sides of the coin through the Marshall School [of Business].”
Several students had positive reviews of Sustainable Microfarms’ goals. If given the chance, Dean Hutkin, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration, said he would try his hand at hydroponics at home.
“It seems like a really efficient and innovative idea,” Hutkin said. “Like other forward-thinking technologies, such as solar panels, it’ll take some time and effort to get started, but in the end it could really benefit both the impoverished and the everyday person.”
Giuseppe Robalino, a sophomore majoring in business administration, also supported the movement and predicted that Sustainable Microfarms will continue to grow.
“This is definitely something that, if marketed right, can really pick up steam,” Robalino said. “Even in urban areas like ours, people are starting to go back to the basics and look for healthier, more high-quality and wholesome food choices. It’s a paradigm shift in the making.”

David Fincher’s The Social Network, which opened in theaters in 2010, painted the college startup scene as something fast-paced, risky and, most of all, exciting. It seemed like the movie compared the startup scene to gambling. Hit it big, and you can drop out of school and work on growing your startup. Fail, and you’ll regret not accepting that summer internship offer.
But every college startup story is different -— from the germination of the original idea to the challenges and successes that these startups might face. Jens Windau, co-founder of AIO Robotics, and Awadi Rathugamage, co-founder of Scholasphere Inc., give a glimpse into what it’s like being a student founder and entrepreneur. Windau is part of Viterbi’s Startup Garage, a 12-week technology accelerator program geared toward creating innovative digital media, Internet, software and hardware companies, illustrate these challenges.
AIO Robotics

Jens Windau doesn’t see many similarities between his experience at his startup and the one portrayed in The Social Network. Though he hasn’t actually seen the film, Windau explained comically, “All I can say is that we did not yet get into a lawsuit and we hope we won’t in the near future.”
AIO Robotics probably won’t, anyway. Windau and co-founder Kai Chang have taken two emerging ideas — 3-D printers and 3-D modeling — to create an all-inclusive 3-D printer. “In order to 3-D print, you need a 3-D model. And in order to create a 3-D model, you need to use 3-D modeling software, which only a small fraction of the population is using on a daily basis,” Windau said. “This is the reason why we came up with the idea to just integrate a 3-D scanner into a 3-D printer and offer the functions of 3-D copying and 3-D faxing.”
The Viterbi Startup Garage, open only to students and recent alumni, is just one of the reasons why being a student has helped Windau and his AIO Robotics team. And while access to resources such as designers, patent lawyers and seed funding from the program were helpful, as a student, Windau has been able to meet fellow students in his classes, some of whom he eventually tapped to be part of his team.
“We all have diverse backgrounds, which helped us do technical development and business development at the same time,” Windau said. “We are also all international students from Taiwan, China, Indonesia and Germany … [which] makes it easier for our company to quickly operate internationally.”
Despite how chaotic the experience has been so far, Windau is thankful to have started AIO Robotics while still in school.
“During college, a lot of people are still undecided as to what they will do with their lives once they graduate. This is a perfect time to find and convince people of your business idea and invite them to join your team,” Windau said. “Post-grad startups often have a lot bigger problems recruiting the right talents because they don’t have access to lots of young, diverse students.”
Even though AIO Robotics has formed its team and finished a working prototype, the journey is far from over. In addition to preparing a live demo in time for the annual Consumer Electronics Show, AIO Robotics hopes to start selling its first batch of machines by next year.
Scholasphere Inc.

After a friend told Awadi Rathugamage about how nice it would be for there to be one place to find scholarship information, he pondered the thought for a while.
“Being already familiar with the Common App for college admissions, I figured it would be great if I could take the list one step further and make a consolidated scholarship application,” Rathugamage said.
And he did.
Rathugamage met future co-founder Christian Vanderwall in a class taught by Ashish Soni, head of the Viterbi Startup Garage. Working with Soni, the two decided to pursue what would become Scholasphere Inc. together and ended up getting into the prestigious accelerator program.
Since they first started collaborating, the team of Rathugamage and Vanderwall has presented Scholasphere Inc. at the Startup Garage’s Demo Days alongside other startups, including AIO Robotics. The small but powerful team has debuted its official website to the general public and has its first provider-sponsored scholarship up on the platform.
Though Rathugamage agrees that being able to use the USC network and access valuable materials as a student is helpful, college startups are certainly not all fun and games.
“It’s a little tough to balance a full course load [especially as a senior] with startup activities,” Rathumage said.
The glamorous depiction of startups is, according to Rathugamage, not entirely accurate. Having a startup doesn’t mean instant popularity or wealth.
“The truth is that it is a steady grind week in and week out, where you are riding a roller coaster of stress and emotion as you strive to keep your company alive,” he said. Despite the late nights and the constant flow of work, however, Rathugamage regrets nothing about his experience so far. Under the guidance of Soni and the support system at USC, Rathugamage has been able to make one idea into a real, viable service.
“It is an incredibly fulfilling learning experience, and would I do it again knowing what I know about the journey now? Absolutely.”

Since his fourth-place finish on American Idol’s fifth season, Chris Daughtry has established that he can sing, whether he’s covering Bon Jovi, Stevie Wonder or Queen. What he has yet to do, though, is write an album that isn’t full of forgettable songs; songs that sound more like Daughtry emulating Nickelback than anything else. Daughtry has yet to define a sound that sets him apart from other rock artists, but on his band’s new album, Baptized, it is clear that he’s attempting to find that sweet spot. Instead of settling for one type of rock, Daughtry incorporates elements from electric dance music to folk to explore what works best for him. Though his blend of rock with the increasingly popular EDM is not quite ideal, the band shines on the album’s pop and folk-oriented songs.
Dynamic · Daughtry’s Baptized brings together various types of rock into a progressive and eclectic, but ultimately inconsequential, album. – Photo courtesy of RCA Records
 
The album’s title track opens with a fingerpicked banjo and simple percussion, developing into a Mumford & Sons-influenced rock ballad. “Baptized” is one of Daughtry’s most original songs on the album, but it still feels formulaic and overly radio-friendly, with a sing-a-long feel and repetitive lyrics. The track introduces a religious theme that will be more or less present throughout the album.
“Waiting For Superman,” the album’s first single, opens with a series of electronic blips that feels strangely reminiscent of Owl City’s “Fireflies.” The instrumentation quickly becomes more guitar-focused, but EDM influences are present throughout the song, with synths and the blips fading in and out over the song’s duration. The song about the helpless girl who’s looking for a savior is a pop-rock staple, but instead of placing himself in that savior role, Daughtry seems to be encouraging her to find salvation on her own. The implicit message here is that it’s through religion that she can be saved, with Daughtry repeatedly mentioning angels and “salvation.” It’s unclear exactly how intentional this is, because many of his seemingly religious lines are also somewhat cliche, but it’s worth thinking about.
The lowest point of this album is the attempted pop ballad titled “Battleships.” Where other songs are bland, this folk/rock/Katy Perry-like mash-up is just plain awful. When a songwriter searches his or her vocabulary for things to compare love to, battleships are not the thing to settle on. For one thing, it’s too similar to Jordin Sparks’ “Battlefield,” which has been popular for years, but the pairing of an awkward theme with production that could have been easily lifted from the latest Katy Perry album and a chorus that goes “boom, boom, boom” makes the song almost unlistenable.
The album’s highlight might be one of the corniest songs on it. “Long Live Rock and Roll” sees Daughtry once again emulating Mumford & Sons with a bit of fun. thrown in, but it works for him. The song covers the history of rock, from The Beatles to U2, evoking just enough nostalgia to save the song. Its chorus is easy to sing along to, with lines such as, “long live big guitars and music for the soul,” and, “long live crazy nights and records made of gold.” It’s a classic feel-good jam and avoids being overly sappy.
The following song, “The World We Knew,” is another high point of the album that sounds similar to “Baptized” and ”Long Live Rock and Roll”. The pop-folk-rock aesthetic really works for Daughtry, and this song also continues the religious theme of Baptized. He sings from the point of view of someone who is struggling with his faith, who wishes to return to the world he knew before even though he recognizes it as sinful. It’s a more relaxed song, but has a more original message than most of the other songs on the album.
Unfortunately for Daughtry, the rest of the album is more of the same bland, unoriginal material that makes up most of his catalog. They step into new places with more EDM-influenced songs such as “Wild Heart,” but most of the songs are so laden with pop and rock clichés that they fall flat. It would be impossible to record all of them, but a few stand out: the “I wish we were younger” feeling of “18 Years,” the “never coming down” line of “High Above the Ground” and basically all of “I’ll Fight.”
Chris Daughtry has to make a decision on what he wants his signature sound to be or he will fall into obscurity like most American Idol winners. Baptized explores new genres outside of his traditional rock focus, but mostly unsuccessfully. The best songs on this album (“Baptized,” “Long Live Rock and Roll”) still feel derivative, but they’re a step in the right direction. The religious themes are more original, but they’re only vaguely present at best. Daughtry has laid out a set of options for himself with this album, applying EDM, pop and folk to his rock roots. No matter which he chooses, the area that needs the most work is his lyrics. None of the songs on the album have the quotable lyrics that some other bands can boast, and the lines that should be quotable just feel repetitive. If he focuses on songwriting for his next album and finds a niche for the band as a pop/folk/rock group, the next Daughtry album might have the individuality he’s been searching for.

The next generation of video gaming has officially arrived with the release of the PlayStation 4, which managed to sell more than a million units in a single day on Nov. 15, and the Xbox One, which will be hitting stores Nov. 22.  On Monday in the McCarthy Quad, USC students were able to get a sneak peak at the console.
The One · The Xbox One Test Drive Tour made a stop at McCarthy Quad on Monday to give students and visitors an opportunity to try the newest installment in the Xbox line before its release on Nov. 22. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
In collaboration with the USC Program Board’s Special Events Committee, the Xbox One Test Drive Tour stopped by campus with an assortment of screens and Xbox One titles available for intrigued gamers to come by and test out the new console before its debut.
It was, however, strictly a gaming affair; the consoles weren’t connected to the Internet, nor were the screens equipped with a Kinect, the motion-sensing technology that is reportedly a fundamental part of the operating system.
The advertisements have emphasized that the Xbox One can function as an all-in-one entertainment system for uses, with entertainment apps, Internet Explorer, Skype, even acting as a DVR receiver for TVs. First and foremost though, it is a gaming console — and many excited gamers waited in anticipation while the Xbox One-branded SUV was setting up to have a chance to test it out before anyone else.
The event had three different games that students and other curious passersby could try on the system: EA’s industry standard soccer game FIFA 14, Microsoft’s franchise-exclusive racing game Forza Motorsports 5 and fighting game Killer Instinct. The introduction of Killer Instinct was met with some nostalgia, as the title is a reboot of the long-dormant series — the last KI game was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996. All three of these titles will be available on the Xbox One’s launch date.
Killer Instinct in particular emphasizes a potential online-centric software sales model encouraged by the Xbox One. Though the initial game will actually be available for free through Xbox Live, it comes with only one playable character. The rest of the playable characters must be unlocked through downloadable content purchases.
As for playing the games themselves, the new Xbox One input devices don’t feel too different from the Xbox 360 controllers. The little details, however, are noticeable — the triggers feel more pressure-sensitive, the bumpers now ergonomically combine into the lower trigger buttons and the joysticks have a little more grip to them. The 360 controllers were already perfectly serviceable, but the subtle improvements do enough to make a difference.
Unfortunately, there was a series of errors with the demos. Either through a lack of consistent power or a wiring hiccup, certain consoles weren’t able to work properly. While this might seem like an omen, these weren’t necessarily retail models of the Xbox One; they were “dev kits,” or units that are specifically used for developing and testing software. Though this does explain the glitches in performance, it leaves an unfair impression for someone who isn’t aware of the distinction.
When the consoles were functioning properly (sadly, the screens that were meant for Forza Motorsports 5 weren’t able to work when they started to allow students to test out the games), they were definitely enjoyable and looked great. Killer Instinct moved at a silky smooth 60 frames per second at 1080p, with stunning particle effects, environments that reverberate with the characters’ attacks and hyper-detailed models. Not to mention that a gamer who remembers the original Killer Instinct games will have a definite rush of nostalgia hearing the game narrator shouting “COMBO BREAKER!”
FIFA 14 doesn’t seem that different in gameplay from its 360/PS3 counterpart, but the graphical enhancements are certainly noticeable. The models look more detailed, move realistically and the crowd looks appropriately alive whenever something exciting happens in a matchup. It looks crystal clear, running at a smooth frame rate with hardly a hiccup in sight. FIFA 14 is more so a polished version of an already good-looking game rather than a fundamental shift in graphical quality.
The games were certainly entertaining to play, but it’s somewhat disappointing that people weren’t given a chance to try out anything with the Kinect or the Internet interface, which is the major selling point for the Xbox One compared to the PlayStation 4. Having a game such as Ryse: Son of Rome, another Xbox One exclusive that makes heavy use of the motion-control features of the Kinect, would’ve been a more appropriate and convincing title to have instead of FIFA 14, which is a multiplatform title.
It’s going to take more than just great-looking games to convince people to pay the extra $100 for the console — Xbox One retails for $500 while the PS4 is available for $400. For one thing, there was little emphasis on the Xbox One’s potential to be a primary source of entertainment in users’ homes in an effort to distinguish it from the PS4. It remains to be seen if the Xbox One Test Drive Tour was effective in convincing consumers that are on the fence to “go green.”

In the past, if you wanted to pay $12 for a movie ticket to the bloodiest film playing in the box office, you had to show your ID and verify that you were over the age of 17. But nowadays, as long as you’re at least 13, you can gain access into almost any violent film you want.
That’s because a recent study published in the Pediatrics journal found that the amount of gun violence featured in recent PG-13 films has increased exponentially, containing as much or more violence than R-rated movies. Upon identifying the steady increase of violence in PG-13 films, the study concluded that even if youths are not using guns, they are being predisposed to aggressive behavior.
The increasingly violent number of PG-13 films being released year after year, as noted by the study, shows just how deeply embedded the appeal of violence has become in this country. Box offices nationwide thrive off of gunshots and bomb explosions.The production of violent films is rising for a reason — because society clearly relishes carnage enough to allow Hollywood to continue thriving economically.
Whether or not violent films actually encourage youth to act with violence and aggression in the real world is one topic that continues to be debated. What is undeniable, however, is the fact that violent films do influence young minds to some extent. It’s what allowed the industry of gory films to flourish in the first place — if violent movies had zero effect whatsoever on the psyche, then people wouldn’t keep coming back for more. In this sense, the study published in Pediatrics makes a valid claim that perhaps youth are being provided with scripts for gun use, although the assertion is still extremely general and seems to imply that any young person exposed to film violence will become aggressive.
As the study notes, when the PG-13 rating was first invented in 1984, films initially featured about as much violence as today’s G and PG-rated films did. But as time progressed, filmmakers jumped at the opportunity to produce violent films. Since 2009, the amount and degree of violence featured in PG-13 films have been comparable to the content featured in films with R-ratings.
So then, what seems to set a PG-13 film apart from an R-rated film? According to the Motion Picture Association of America, PG-13 films “may [include] depictions of violence … but generally not both realistic and extreme or persistent violence,” while R-rated movies allow this kind of violence. It is overtly evident, however, that PG-13 movies nowadays are injected with just this kind of violence. The implications this are twofold: one, that filmmakers today judge that it is appropriate for youth to be exposed to extreme violence and two, that because of this, exposure to violence is far more accessible than it had been in past decades.
It appears that while the MPAA seems to have qualms with explicit sexual nudity and intense drug abuse, which are reserved for R-rated films, the type of violence also reserved for R-rated films has been appearing more often and more intensely in top-grossing PG-13 films. Why is it that the MPAA chooses to bar the exposure of sexuality and drug abuse to our youth while allowing them full access to extreme violence? After all, there must be a valid reason that films including such crude sex and drug scenes are made significantly less accessible to the youth using the R-rating.
Regardless of whether or not violent films affect the youth to the extent that they become violent and aggressive in real life, the fact of the matter remains that they do certainly influence our society, as evidenced by the popularity of bloodstained films among  younger demographics. Perhaps the MPAA recognizes this as an economic opportunity, and for that reason treats violence much more liberally than it does sex and drugs. Nonetheless, it is now undeniably more difficult for parents to regulate what their children are exposed to, since they can no longer rely on the MPAA to appropriately regulate which age groups should be able to see which films. Though the debate will forever continue over whether films inspire the youth to commit violent crimes, one thing is for certain: An enthusiasm for violence has become deeply embedded within our culture, and its impact upon society will only continue to increase.

I wonder if the author actually ever saw these violent films she is disparaging. 
If she has – then I would ask – how soon after she watched said violent movie, did she herself commit an act of violence towards another person? What – you say she didn’t? Well then why does she and other sanctimonious people think they are intelligent and self-controlled enough to not have a violent film transfer violence onto their behavior but then not think others can do the same? 
I am tired of us constantly created a society the caters to the dumbest common denominator. Raise the bar – expect more from people. If you can’t watch “Texas Chainsaw Massacre” without cutting up people afterwards – then YOU are the problem, not the movie.

Technology has the ability to bridge the longest of distances. Most recently, the focus is in the hospital room and not in cyberspace: Remote presence robots allow physicians to “beam” into hospitals to diagnose and treat patients. Though the new approach might seem impersonal, the increase in efficiency and cost make the innovation worthy of praise.
Zoe Haddad | Daily Trojan
The Associated Press recently reported that nearly 1,000 hospitals in the United States and abroad have installed InTouch telemedicine devices. In addition, 50 RP-VITA robots were launched this past May. The mobile video conferencing machine moves on wheels and stands 5 feet tall, complete with a large screen projecting the doctor’s face. Developed by InTouch Health and iRobot Corp., this innovation is the first Food and Drug Administration-cleared telemedicine robot that combines telecommunications with AutoDrive technology.
Today, remote presence robots allow physicians to “beam” into hospitals to diagnose and treat patients. Though the new approach might seem impersonal, the increase in efficiency and cost make the innovation worthy of praise.
Though the $5,000 per month price tag to rent a robot seems a bit hefty, the investment is actually very cost-effective. Virtual consultations allow for high-tech monitoring without patients having to leave their homes and makes patient are less expensive. In considering the impending  health care overhaul, many hospitals have prioritized cutting costs wherever possible. Telemedicine is continually transforming the delivery of health care, and might be the long sought-after solution to helping patients with transportation or mobility issues access primary care providers as well as helping to remedy the shortage of physicians. Anywhere, anytime, providers can now become involved proactively with the well-being of their patients. It’s not a bad deal, considering the many positive consequences financially and efficiency-wise.
As many are quick to point out, however, robots tend to give a cold and distant impression. Though the technology seems impersonal, patients have claimed that it feels as though the doctors are right there in the room. I think we can all agree on the fact that telemedicine cannot equate to an in-person doctor visit — nothing can replace meeting the patient up close and in person, but robotic technology can be a good substitute.
Nevertheless, there is always a time and place for such technological advances. With telemedicine, situations in which doctor-patient meet-ups seemed improbable simply because of distance or now become doable. U.S. News reported that health care company Mercy Health, after beginning to use telemedicine in 2006, has since reduced mortality rates in its intensive care unit to 20 percent below the expected level as well as reduced patients’ lengths of stay by 30 percent.
When in-person meetings between physicians and patients might not always be plausible, telemedicine has made virtual appointments the next best thing. A remote doctor-patient discussion is better than no consultation at all, and this future of revolutionized delivery of care will both decrease the cost of healthcare and better the efficiency of delivery. For now, this seems to be a win-win situation that should spread throughout the field and allow more people to be treated, anywhere, anytime — after all, that is the motto of the digital age.
