USC lost two of three games in a series against No. 13 Oregon this weekend at Dedeaux Field. 
The losses bring the Trojans to an overall record of 17-13 and a record of 6-6 in the Pac-12. 
Oregon improves to an overall record of 22-8 and a 8-4 record in the Pac-12. The Ducks will host UCLA for a three-game series next weekend, while USC will play LMU midweek.
USC won the first game of the series Friday by a score of 9-5. Oregon took an early 2-0 lead with RBI’s from sophomore outfielder Aaron Zavala and freshman infielder Josh Kasevich. The Ducks added another RBI in the fourth and redshirt junior infielder Ben Ramirez added an RBI for USC, cutting Oregon’s lead to 3-1. 
USC came back in the fifth, with redshirt freshman outfielder Rhylan Thomas, redshirt freshman infielder Tyresse Turner, freshman infielder D’Andre Smith and Ramirez all scoring to give USC a 5-3 lead. The Trojans secured the win after a homer from Turner in the seventh and an RBI from Ramirez in the eighth. 
Oregon tied the series by winning the second game decisively by a score of 13-4 Saturday. Oregon took an early lead again in the second game of the series, scoring seven runs in the second inning and five in the fourth, giving the Ducks a 13-3 lead after four frames. USC was not able to make a comeback despite Turner scoring in the third, redshirt senior outfielder Brady Shockey scoring in the fourth and freshman catcher Garret Guillemette scoring in the fourth and sixth innings.
In Sunday’s rubber game, USC was the team that jumped out to an early lead, scoring 2 runs in the first with RBI’s from Turner and redshirt junior infielder Jamal O’Guinn. 
“We just try to bring a lot of energy and try to rally behind each other on Sundays,” redshirt sophomore pitcher Alex Cornwell said. “It was kind of the same thing. We know that they’re a good team and we know who we’re playing and we know what we’re trying to do, so we just try to stick to our game plan as always and just stay within ourselves and stay with us.”
The final game of the series Sunday was back and forth, with USC scoring another two runs in the third and Oregon scoring in three straight innings to bring the score to 4-3 in favor of USC. Neither team scored in the fifth, sixth, or seventh innings. 
Cornwell led the USC defense Sunday, pitching seven innings, striking out five batters and allowing only three runs. 
“I gotta hand it to the defense,” Cornwell said. “I thought that they did really well and that really helps you as a pitcher. It gives you confidence to throw the ball over the plate and let them hit the ball because you know you have eight guys behind you, with you, doing everything they can to get outs and it really showed.”
Oregon ran away with the lead in the eighth, scoring four runs with two RBI’s from sophomore infielder Sam Novitske, and one RBI each from senior infielder Gabe Matthews and sophomore outfielder Tanner Smith. USC responded with an RBI from Shockey in the eighth to make it 7-5 but could not come back to win. 
“It’s weird because baseball is a strange game,” Cornwell said. “Sometimes things can go not your way and that’s not anything on your part or their part. It’s just the game. It’s a whole bunch of variables and ‘I don’t-knows.’ The game just got away from what it was. That’s just how baseball is and you just gotta live with it and learn and move on.”
USC will host LMU on Tuesday at Dedeaux Field. The Trojans and Lions have met twice this season, first for the season opening series and once last month. USC won the series 2-1 and the game 4-3.  
“We always take the positives,” Cornwell said. “We always take what we do well and carry it over into the coming week. We always acknowledge the things we need to work on. I know as a team, we are feeling good coming to host LMU. We know that we’re playing good baseball and we just gotta keep carrying that and keep just trusting ourselves and sticking with each other.” 
First pitch against LMU is Tuesday at 6 p.m.

The traffic on the way to the Coliseum, the humming of USC fans on the outskirts of the stadium and the noise from the crowd were oddly familiar. 
After fans chanted “We Want Spencer,” in the first quarter, redshirt junior inside linebacker Spencer Gilbert proceeded to intercept the ball on the next possession, sending the crowd in a frenzy. 
In many ways, it was finally like things were returning to normal at the Coliseum
It was USC’s annual Spring Showcase, but the energy and the feel of having fans, approximately 5,000, in the stands for the first time since November 2019 was evident. And, most importantly, it marked a new season of USC football with renewed expectations and pressure to live up to them.
Both sidelines were bouncy and exuberant to be back on the field with Team Cardinal securing a 27-7 victory over Team Gold Saturday. 
“What a wonderful day to be in the Coliseum. A Southern California weather day, beautiful day and to have a lot of kids have the opportunity to play in front of their families and some fans and it was just an enjoyable day all the way around,” head coach Clay Helton said in a virtual press conference Saturday. “Good for our football team to kind of see — after eight practices, this being our ninth — just kind of see where we’re at.”
The teams played four 12-minute quarters with no fair catches on punts or kickoffs and no 15-minute half time break. It resulted in fast paced action with both sides of the ball showcasing their talent. 
The game started much like how the upcoming season might — with a pass from junior quarterback Kedon Slovis to junior wide receiver Drake London for a first down catch. 
The on-field chemistry between Slovis and London was the story of the game for the Team Gold offense and evident whenever they were on the field together. 
London had seven total catches for 139 yards, including a huge 45-yard catch from Slovis in the third quarter that led to a touchdown run from senior running back Vavae Malepeai. Slovis finished with 128 yards passing on 12 attempts. 
The defenses on both teams only allowed 20 combined points in the first half, highlighting a group that has the potential to be one of the best in the Pac-12. They also forced five turnovers overall, including a fumble and four interceptions. 
Helton had high praise for all positions on defense, including the linebackers, who he mentioned looked the best during the game. The corners also played “lights out,” according to Helton.
“I really liked the development today … I like where we are really, a lot. I was a little bit worried [about our secondary] coming into camp, it may end up being one of the strengths of our team by the end of it,” he said. 
For Team Gold, junior defensive end Drake Jackson was a menace. On the final possession of the first half for team Cardinal, Jackson proceeded to bat a Slovis pass down and then steamrolled over an offensive lineman for a sack. 
The defensive line, in particular, seems to be poised to wreak havoc on opposing teams during the season. It created issues for the offensive line, which was inconsistent throughout the game. 
“Over [an] entire camp I have been pleased with the offensive line … You get in some live game experience and you probably have some mistakes and some things you’re going to correct,” Helton said. “But there also was some positive aspects of it. I thought they allowed the runners to do some nice things today.”
The offensive line’s pass blocking contributed to a 48-yard reception from Texas transfer senior Keaontay Ingram. He galloped down the field juking past defenders and showcasing what he can bring to the Trojan backfield. 
His big gain led to the Gold’s only touchdown of the game — a touchdown reception from redshirt senior quarterback Mo Hasan to redshirt sophomore wide receiver Bru McCoy. 
Outside of Ingram, returning redshirt senior running backs Stephen Carr and Vavae Malepeai ran the ball well and for two touchdowns combined. Even walk-on redshirt freshman Matt Columbo had a 24-yard run that led to a touchdown reception by freshman wide receiver Michael Jackson III to close the game. 
All four backs combined for 150 total rushing yards. 
“I really liked what Keaontay Ingram and Brandon Campbell showed, not only today but all the way through camp and [I’m] really excited about their future here,” Helton said. “And then you saw just the experience of Vavae [Malepeai] and Stephen Carr and what they bring to the table … Man are we in a great situation, right there, right now with these kids.”
USC will continue their offseason with spring practices and kick-off the 2021 season against San Jose State Sept. 4.

What started out as a simple text bemoaning the pandemic became Sophia Production’s virtual music festival “bummerfest” held last month. 
Juniors Sophia Barber and Sophie Moser — both majoring in music industry and co-founders of their production company Sophia Productions — had found out in December that a concert that they were planning was likely going to be virtual and experience budget cuts because of the pandemic. 
“We were texting each other on the side and [saying things like], ‘This sucks. What a bummer, they should rename it to bummerfest,’” Barber said. “And then Sophie’s like, ‘Oh wait … that’s a great idea, we should definitely do that.” 
The pair decided to plan their own musical festival, called “bummerfest,” kicking off months of planning for the pair — all conducted through Zoom save for two meetings at USC Village — which culminated in a musical festival featuring six USC artists and attended by 200 people.    
Bummerfest was far from Barber or Moser’s first time planning a music event. Both of their experiences in event planning stretched all the way back to middle and high school. 
The pair grew up playing classical music — Barber with the cello and piano and Moser with piano and voice — but realized that they gravitated more towards creating musical events rather than performing.    
“I started my own summer [music] camp when I was … 11, because there were a bunch of little kids in my neighborhood that I babysat,” Moser said. “[It] kind of grew into a bigger thing that I did all throughout high school … And that was when I realised like, ‘OK, the performance side isn’t for me, but I really like this whole management and leadership approach to events.” 
Once just a camp for 15 children, Moser’s “Play Camp” eventually grew over the course of eight years into a full-scale theatre camp for 50 children.  
As for Barber, her first experience in event planning was when she threw a charity benefit at a tavern for the youth organization “Youth on Record” in 2017. 
“[They help] the youth of Denver get back on their feet after they’ve experienced hardships through music,” Barber said. “I had heard about them before, they’re big in the Denver scene … [I’d] seen them around and admired their mission.” 
Spurred on by their respective successes in music event production, Barber and Moser applied to the Thornton School of Music, where they first met each other in their introduction to music industry class during their freshman years.  
“We both ended up sitting by the same girl, Andrea, and both of us became friends with her and then she brought us together,” Moser said. “Then we just realized how much we had in common besides the name thing [and] that led us to want to work on stuff together.”
Once they worked together on a group project for their concert production and promotion class, the pair started to realize that they potentially had a golden partnership on their hands. Grouped with three of their other music industry friends, Moser and Barber were expected to throw a benefit concert. 
The group, who together called themselves “TGFC Productions,” threw on a show called “TGFC Presents Ashes to Amber and Cordelia.” Taking place at a downtown venue, the event featured an array of visual and performance artists and was attended by nearly 70 people. 
“I think we had something really cool there … We just connected people from a lot of different areas,” Moser said. “That doesn’t happen all of the time … we saw this opportunity of bringing together people from all different places that really needed each other’s skills to benefit and grow and make cool projects.” 
Fresh off the success of the benefit concert, Moser and Barber approached the rest of TGFC Productions with a plan to continue their efforts outside of the class. When their group mates said they weren’t interested in concert planning, Moser and Barber took it upon themselves to start their own company.  
“Having our own production company that we can do a bunch of different things under, but has a cohesive space and name, really helps us grow out of just a class project or opportunities we find through school,” Barber said. “[It] allowed us to … create our visions.” 
With the goal of “breaking the divide between creatives and the industry in music through concerts, conversation and entrepreneurship,” Sophia Productions also hosts a podcast called “That’s Showbiz, Baby,” which is now in its second season after its inception in October 2020. 
On the podcast, the duo discuss the current music scene, comment on new music event trends including holograms and invite USC students from all facets of the music industry as special guests. 
“We both realized that people view the music industry as kind of this … cool, mysterious thing … and a lot of people want to get to know more about it,” Moser said. “[Since] we were really interested in learning more about it, might as well put what we’re learning out there for other people to hear and follow along with.” 
The pair can’t recall exactly what sparked their interest in making a podcast. 
“I feel like everyone is like, ‘We should start a podcast’ … We just decided to actually do it,” Barber said.
However, Barber and Moser said that they appreciate the opportunity to meet people that they might never have spoken to before if it were not for the podcast. 
“My favorite part about it has been the excuse to reach out to people that I already thought were cool and wanted to be friends with, and now, I have a reason to do it,” Moser said. 
Barber and Moser split the podcast episodes so that it would roughly be 50-50 between interviews and commentary, intent on creating a space where they could mix a variety of topics related to the music industry.
Despite being avid podcast listeners — they named “Song Exploder” and “Switched on Pop” as podcasts that they listen to regularly — Barber and Moser had never done a podcast before, and felt some trepidation when doing their first episode. 
“In the beginning, I didn’t realize how scary it would be … to just sit there on a computer, but with a microphone in front of you, knowing that other people were going to listen to it,” Barber said. “So I think the first couple episodes we were trying our best, but they’re a little tense, you could tell we were a little nervous.” 
However, with two seasons now under their belt, Barber and Moser now find themselves at ease while crafting their podcast episodes. 
“[We’ve become] a little more natural and … go back and forth a little bit more,” Moser said. “It can be easy, just like in our planning stages, be like, ‘You say this’ [and] have it planned out, but [now] we’ve grown to leave a lot more room for just naturally responding to what the other person is bringing, and I think that helps it be a lot more relaxed and fun to listen to. 
One of their most recent episodes, released April 6 and titled “Behind the Scenes of bummerfest,” details the months of planning and preparation that went into gearing up for the event. 
It’s a bit astounding to see the level of detail required to plan a music festival when you listen to Barber and Moser break down their pitching, networking and marketing strategies as well as the network of support they formulated over the course of the planning. 
After their fateful text conversation, Barber and Moser set out to reach out to various musical artists at Thornton whose music fit nicely within their theme — dancing through the sadness or a “bummer,” if you will. 
They asked the potential acts to attend a Zoom meeting, where they presented their pitch deck, walked them through the plans for the venue, gave them a basic outline of the project and laid out the benefits for the artists’ participation. 
Out of the eight USC artists they reached out to, six signed onto the event: Guspy, Amir Kelly, Lizzy Cameron, Ella Collier, Tippy Balady and Walkabout.  
Opting for a hybrid musical festival, Barber and Moser had the musical acts perform outdoors at Shadow Hills Ranch and festival attendees streamed the music festival through Moment House. 
“They gave us in-ears so I could actually hear myself,” Collier said. “It was just a quality performance, definitely was one of my favorite performances … the banter between us and the crew was really fun so it felt really comfortable.” 
As for the promotion of the event, Moser and Barber went for a social-media heavy approach on their Instagram page @sophiaproductions. They announced each bummerfest act daily during the last week of February, launched a merch giveaway, released a trailer and then posted short snippets of each act’s performances. 
“Something that I’ve been learning over the course of the pandemic, in general, is that the more you can get something out there from different people, the more credible it becomes to people in their minds,” Moser said. “Like if you see … one friend post something one time, it kind of fades away but if you see 10 or 15 friends all posting about the same event, it’s going to stand out to you a lot more.”   
While they had done similar promotional work for Ashes to Amber and Cordelia, they had never done so much marketing between just the two of them. But as a result of their promotional tactics, user engagement with their page jumped by a whopping 153,900%. 
Along with their team, Barber and Moser estimate that they spent 20 hours each during the harder weeks working on the project, a notable feat considering most of it was conducted virtually and this was their most ambitious effort yet.  
“There are definitely a few times where I remember just sitting at my computer and being like, ‘What am I doing, I can’t do this, this is so much work,’ and just powering through in those moments … like, OK, what’s the next step,’” Moser said. “That made it look a lot more achievable than backing up and looking at the bigger picture.” 
Their film team — Jon Joei and Kian Broder Wang — helped them through the logistics of planning a virtual event since they had done one in the past, but for the most part they simply walked through what it took to plan an in-person event and shifted it to a virtual perspective. 
“It came pretty naturally to us besides the super technical parts,” Barber said.  
Moser points to the filming process as the most memorable part of the project because she was finally able to meet the artists they had talked to in person. 
“Obviously there weren’t audience members there to appreciate it but when we were filming it, it was just fun to interact with people and hear a little bit of the music,” Moser said. 
Vivan Gray, who was responsible for the event’s production design and video editing, recalled the pair’s leadership during the filming. 
“There was this horse fountain that kept going off [at the ranch] and we were like, ‘What should we do about this,’ and [Barber and Moser] were like, ‘Eh, it adds character,’” Gray said. “They’re very good at going with the motion and they kept the energy up even when we did have technical difficulties… they were great at communication as well.”  
Collier also noted the pair’s skill in organization, saying, “They have all the details handled… they’re always very prepared.” 
Ultimately, 200 people attended the event, making bummerfest Sophia Productions’ biggest musical event. 
“I had a lot of fun doing [bummerfest], and I think it definitely confirmed that it’s something that I like to do and I’m capable of doing,” Moser said. “The night of the show, [I was] watching it with a friend… that was so rewarding because just all the work we had put it in to make sure it was a high-quality event, it paid off, it really showed itself.” 
While the pandemic still is casting its shadow over their future projects, Barber and Moser are still planning smaller-scale events for 2021, as well as a possible 2022 bummerfest. 
“[bummerfest] was an incredible amount of work and I don’t think I knew how hard it was going to be going into it, but I love working with Sophie,” Barber said. “Because we’ve been working together for a while now, we know each other’s strengths and I completely trust her to just handle a task.”

“So what we hang out / so what we drink tea,” sings the YouTuber duo Fung Brothers in their iconic music video “The 626.” “We just eating good / In the SGV.”
When I applied to USC as a transfer student, I watched YouTube videos about Los Angeles and the city’s surrounding areas, mainly the fun music videos by the Fung Brothers. Many of those included videos about the San Gabriel Valley (also known as the SGV), such as “The 626” or Al Jazeera’s “Inside the Chinese Food Mecca of Los Angeles.” 
I’ve visited the SGV frequently throughout my life, as I have family members who live there. Yet, those videos that pay homage to the Chinese American food culture that defines it visually expressed a community that I’d subconsciously wanted in my college experience: a true “home away from home.” 
As a Chinese American who grew up in the Bay Area, it’s safe to say that Asian food and culture is more than merely familiar to me — as many Asian Americans say, it’s a fundamental part of the home. During my first year of college, I discovered that Asian food was scarce in the predominantly white college town I lived in. 
I ended up visiting the same Korean restaurant so many times I didn’t even have to say my order anymore — the staff members knew it by heart. For a sad and lonely college soul, that consumption of food reaffirmed my connection to others. 
At USC, I envisioned immersing myself in the Chinese American culture of nearby L.A. I imagined myself on weekends strolling through the 99 Ranch Market in Arcadia or visiting Factory Tea Bar, that boba place in San Gabriel that the Fung Brothers visited in “The 626.” I wanted to watch Asian singers and rappers such as Jason Chen and MC Jin perform at the 626 Night Market and eat my favorite Chongqing noodles at the acclaimed Chinese restaurant Mian, all within the SGV.
“You can’t do all of that by yourself,” my mother told me.
It seems silly now. At that time, I think I’d perhaps underestimated the amount of time it would take to travel to most parts of the SGV from the USC campus. I’d also read about how difficult it was to make friends as a transfer student, and I’d predicted I would most likely be hailing afternoon Ubers to the SGV alone (which now that I think about it, still feels a bit sad). 
Yet, I also knew that I needed to be around the Chinese food and culture I’d grown up with not just to prevent feeling lonely but to truly feel at home. 
That idea of home is why the SGV holds such a personal and symbolic significance. Videos like “The 626” or “Bobalife” demonstrate the vitality of the Chinese communities that have made the SGV home. Maybe that’s a testament to the importance of Asian YouTubers and storytellers creating their own platforms. Maybe it’s just about the power inherent in seeing the culture that has shaped you in its own distinct cultural community.
I guess I think about the SGV in a sort of “Legally Blonde” Elle Woods-esque way, that food forms connections and connections are what make people happy. It’s something I said was essential to understanding me in the USC application, that I love sharing meals with others because it means sharing happiness.
Of course, now that I’ve taken classes on the politics of Asian American history and identity, I admit that I’m a bit more skeptical of thinking about SGV culture as simply noodles and bubble tea. I also believe that there’s a widespread tendency to value immigrants’ food and cultural products more than immigrants themselves. Thus, I want to think about the Chinese American diaspora more critically and beyond its elements that are so prominent in popular culture. 
At the same time, food and its familiarity are why a term like “comfort food” exists. There’s a reason why Asian Americans who are writing about Asian American identity so often turn to food. There’s a reason why fun videos about the food culture of the SGV can resonate with so many on a deeper, more serious level, and why even visual cues like dim sum carts and B-roll footage of blocks upon blocks of Chinese-language plazas and Chinese restaurants have so much meaning. 
As the online semester begins to wrap up this week, it’s hit me that I only have two years left as an undergraduate. I’ve started reflecting more on what I want from college and L.A. as a whole, but it’s difficult to articulate the academic or social goals I have, if any. Maybe I’ll spend a lot of time in the SGV. Maybe I won’t. 
Regardless, I do know I want to spend the rest of my time at USC feeling at home. That comes first and foremost from “eating good.” Yet, maybe it’s not really about the food at all, but about the connections it represents, which to me, are really just about being happy.

It’s not a secret that college tuition is expensive. Tuition increased by 1416.68% nationally from 1977 to 2021 and is rising at twice the inflation rate. USC is no exception to this national rise in tuition prices, with its current tuition sitting at around $60,000 per year. Meanwhile, the median household income, $68,703, is less than $10,000 more than USC tuition. Needless to say, people are struggling to pay. University students from across the nation, including those at USC, have complained about these rising costs. 
With the recent transition to online classes, students are questioning their tuition more than ever. There are a few factors to this increased frustration including the fact that education quality has never been worse, a college degree is seen as an essential in the workforce and that colleges fail to transparently report how they spend this money. 
Due to the coronavirus, students have been taking online Zoom classes since March 2020. They get no access to classrooms, in-person events or campus. Education at USC is arguably exactly the same as education at a California community college, which charges approximately  $1,500 per year. Students should not have to pay 20 times more for an identical experience. 
Many students struggle to afford higher education, especially with the recent recession. Some take on extreme loans which would stress them out for years. The average student loan debt up in the United States is $32,000, which is a 20% increase from five years ago, and it does not show signs of stopping. 
A recent change to the workforce is that college degrees are now seen as the norm. Before, a high school diploma would be sufficient in landing an entry-level job that could develop into a career. Now, people with high school diplomas are very often not able to find a steady income. Therefore, going to college is not seen as a choice, but rather a necessity. This attitude is especially discouraging, since it implies that paying the insane tuition price is not an option; students need to go to college to have a career.
Many universities are also not transparent on how this money is being spent. Students do not know if their money is actually getting spent on education or other things. They feel unheard and unappreciated for taking out loans for college and not knowing how the finances are being used.   
Although these tuition problems are prevalent at every college, USC is one of the worst schools on this issue. In May 2020, after the coronavirus first became widespread in the U.S., USC planned a 3.5% increase in tuition, whether classrooms reopened or not. This pattern is not ending, with USC raising tuition for the next school year.
USC students were already extremely frustrated with tuition before the pandemic. Not only was tuition much higher than the national average for private schools by approximately $24,000, USC also charges a lot of money for additional things. For example, USC counts audited units as regular tuition, meaning students have to pay $2,000 per audited unit. USC also charges an additional $2,000 for every unit if a student goes over 18 units in a semester. USC’s tuition and add-on costs make it the eighth most expensive college nationally. 
When combined with current issues such as Zoom classes and lack of transparency, it’s easy to see why students are so disheartened by tuition. Not only is the university not extending help financially, but students often get no communication on how their money is spent. Especially in current times, it feels as if students are just throwing money at a university that does not respond to their requests.

When I got the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, I was surprisingly emotional; the shot in my arm marked a new chapter in public health following the difficulties of the last year. Luckily, my vaccine shot was one of many. With over 3 million Americans vaccinated daily, herd immunity is within reach. 
Although vaccine distribution in the United States makes it feel like we’ve cleared a hurdle, the result of people rushing to travel and return to normal life generates an entirely new problem. How do we certify immunity to the coronavirus when people travel to other countries? Nonprofits can support this next phase of the pandemic. 
According to public health experts, verifying a person’s immunity is critical in the return to normalcy. Referred to as a vaccine passport, verifying coronavirus immunity will give people the opportunity to bypass certain quarantine measures when they travel. 
Vaccine passports are nothing new; the United States has used vaccine passports for public health purposes for over a century. In the early 1900s, the United States required proof of vaccination for smallpox to enter the country, and in the 21st century, proof of vaccination for Yellow Fever is commonly required. 
While the European Union, China, Japan and Israel recently revealed their coronavirus vaccine passport programs, the White House announced it will not similarly create a nationwide app. Instead, the Biden Administration gives states discretion to implement a vaccine passport, allowing both the private and nonprofit sector the opportunity to develop a vaccine passport app. 
Many nonprofits have already partnered with businesses to develop apps for a vaccine passport. The nonprofit CommonPass, which makes health records accessible in digital form, partnered with JetBlue and United Airlines to create an app that shares test results and vaccination records to allow people on planes.
Health-centered nonprofits such as CommonPass often have the trust and connections to local communities that major airlines including JetBlue or United lack, making a partnership extremely valuable. Dakota Gruener, the executive director of the nonprofit ID2020, which works on digital identification, emphasizes this important role of nonprofits in vaccine passports when she claims the process cannot be driven solely by the private sector. 
As organizations with specific missions to promote the welfare of society rather than make a profit, nonprofits are a logical choice to help with public health initiatives. But, with the responsibility to create a vaccine passport, nonprofits must acknowledge, address and alleviate the existing problems in healthcare — mainly, vaccine distribution inequity.
While the vaccine passport itself does not cause inequities, it showcases the disparities of vaccine distribution at a global level. Although headlines celebrate the United States’ extremely successful vaccine rollout, nearly 100 countries have not started any coronavirus vaccination program, with many low-income nations lacking necessary financial resources for vaccine administration sites or storage facilities. Additionally, the United Nations refugee agency found that of the countries they collected information on, only 54 of 133 explicitly stated they will vaccinate refugees, asylum seekers or those who are stateless. As a result, the vaccine passport prioritizes the travel of the most privileged and wealthiest countries. 
Hopefully, when nonprofits see firsthand how a vaccine passport perpetuates inequities, they will be inspired to change the underlying issues. Ideally, local nonprofits can deliver vaccines to remote locations with little infrastructure, thereby accessing the people and communities the government may miss.  
For example, when the nonprofit Community Organized Relief Effort realized that the vaccination center at Dodger Stadium served mostly white and affluent people, it created mobile clinics to go to other parts of the city. In contrast to the Dodger Stadium site, 70% of people who received the vaccine at CORE mobile sites are Black. 
This model of bringing necessary resources to communities should be replicated at a global level. If nonprofits do not actively seek to vaccinate marginalized communities, they will continue to be overlooked — both abroad and within the United States.
There is, however, a reason to feel hopeful. The nonprofit GlobalGiving collected over $13 million in donations to make vaccines more accessible and affordable around the world, filling holes left by the government in the process. For the greatest impact, nonprofits should partner with both the governments and other organizations to increase efforts for vaccination world-wide. If nonprofits help develop a vaccine passport that restricts travel for people without coronavirus immunity, they must help those people get vaccinated in the first place.

Yesterday, I was catching up with the latest heats in the Rip Curl Narrabeen Classic, hosted in a coastal suburb of Sydney, Australia. The men’s Round of 32 boasted beautiful conditions — clear blue water, bright sunny skies and, of course, limited restrictions due to New South Wales’ coronavirus handling.
What would it take to get us there (if the question of travel was no issue)? Some quick Google searches brought up $2,800+ single roundtrip plane tickets, Airbnb’s for around $80 a night and who knows how many dollars you’d need to put away for equipment and transportation. The expenses add up quickly and push you to spend in order to be involved in the sport. 
Ask anyone at an Australian beach and they’ll tell you their anecdotes about filling out their first set of gear. Down there, you can’t just grab a board and go when two-thirds of the year is spent with water below 60 degrees. You’ll need the board, the swimsuits, the wetsuits, leash, fins, wax and whatever else your local surf shop can convince you that you need. Even getting these items pre-owned still leaves a gap in your wallet — but why is this a problem?
It’s not difficult to make the connection between having a surplus of money and the amount of leisure time you afford yourself. This is a privilege in and of itself, allowing some wealthier individuals the opportunity to invest more into their gear, time and enjoyment of the sport. 
I’m not saying you need to be wealthy to enjoy surfing, but when you pull back the curtain on programs that offer once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, like maybe a surf trip to the Maldives or a go at Kelly Slater’s Surf Ranch wave pool, money can make two very different experiences out of the same activity. 
An important aspect of this cost analysis that many people forget is time and space. For people who live farther inland, possibly in densely populated areas that afford little to no green space, natural environments like the beach are not quickly accessible. Not entirely related but an uncomfortable sibling to the “mission trip,” is the trip professionals make to lower-income or native communities to “bring” surfing to them with a handful of free gear and a photo op. Indeed, it is profitable to publicize wealth gaps within the sport. 
The World Health Organization’s European office conducted a study into the positive outcomes derived from urban green space and health, including reduced morbidity and mortality rates, reduced exposure to air pollution and supportive social environments. In any conversation involving the expansion of Los Angeles’ public transportation infrastructure, the topic of connecting urban spaces to the city’s beautiful beaches should be on the docket. 
A survey of over 10,000 people in Europe showed a correlation between an individual’s informedness about ocean pollution and their care for its improvement. With projections pointing to there being more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050, direct community interaction can hopefully increase awareness and prioritizing of these issues and combat marine conservation degradation.
Instead of contributing to a use-and-lose mentality when it comes to surf equipment and gear, popularizing surfboard resellers like the SurfboardBroker in our very own Carlsbad, Calif. can encourage the surfing community to reuse, reduce and recycle. The plastics that go into making surf equipment are harmful enough to the environment, and educating enthusiasts on what they can do with their leftovers can keep less waste out of the ocean.
Although surfing maybe isn’t  the sport on everyone’s radar, it can be worth the investment to narrow the gaps between those who can afford to do it and those who cannot. The greatest opportunities and lessons come from what is free, and the more we can give back to our environment the more fruitful it will be.

The last game of the regular season for both No. 16 USC and No. 5 UCLA came to an end with a 2-2 draw in front of friends and family at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Friday. The matchup between the Bruins and Trojans was the first game since the beginning of the pandemic in which guests of players and coaches were allowed to visit the stadium. 
“Fans always add an extra level of energy and it has been missed,“ head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “It was truly, truly exciting to have people back in the stands.”
The Trojans started the game strong, with senior forward Tara McKeown testing UCLA goalkeeper Lauren Brzykcy thrice before assisting junior forward Penelope Hocking’s goal in the 10th minute. The early goal fueled UCLA’s forwards to attack, as the Bruins attempted six shots thereafter. However, USC held their 1-0 lead for the rest of the first half. 
A corner kick in the 46th minute led to McKeown heading the Trojans’ second goal of the match in the corner of the net, pushing the USC lead to 2-0. In the 55th minute, UCLA senior Delanie Sheehan put her team on the scoreboard, defeating the USC defense with impeccable skill and beating redshirt senior goalkeeper Kaylie Collins in a one-on-one to make it 2-1. Afterward, the Trojans countered with a combination of passing and support play and an attempted shot by freshman forward Katie Roditis. 
With the game holding at 2-1, the Trojans’ defense parked the bus and had the majority of the team behind the half line for the rest of the half. They faced a strong UCLA offense that kept control of the ball and had nine shots in the second half. 
It was a truly impressive game for Collins who, with support from defense, was able to fend off the Bruins. Collins successfully faced several one-on-one’s from UCLA’s attack and had nine saves in total. 
“It always gives our team, the backline in particular, more confidence when you have someone back behind you who you have the utmost belief in,” McAlpine said. “Our team played better as [Collins] got more confident.” 
In the 87th minute, UCLA senior midfielder Olivia Athens took advantage of a free kick lobbed into the Trojan box and scored to tie the game at 2 apiece. The last minute goal sent the game into overtime, which ended goalless. It was the second time this season the Trojans squandered a 2-1 lead against UCLA with minutes to spare.
“It was really about fortitude — who was willing to fight through the fatigue,” McAlpine said. “Stay focused, locked in and really just get after it, and I thought they did a really great job.”
The Trojans have not lost a game since their back-to-back upset losses at Utah and Colorado in March, having lost 0-2 and 2-3 to the respective teams. The Trojans have also avoided conceding a goal since their previous match against the Bruins in March, a streak which was broken Friday against UCLA. 
“Coming off the Colorado loss … we had to change the way we were doing things and it says a lot about the team … and their competitive spirit that they locked in,” McAlpine said. “We were in a winner goes home mode for the remainder of the season and were able to get results.” 
The Bruins have done well to avoid losses this season, losing only once to Arizona State and drawing twice against USC. Freshman forward Reilyn Turner established herself as a crucial member of the team, having scored 9 goals this season — the highest on the team. 
After having finished their regular seasons 7-3-3 and 12-1-2, respectively, USC and UCLA will now wait to find out their seeding in the NCAA tournament. Seedings will be revealed Monday. 
“You got to be proud of the way we closed the season,” McAlpine said. “I think we’re playing with great form going into the tournament and I think we deserve to be in it, potentially seeded.”

Growing up in Atlanta, Ga., Neha Halebeed remembers seeing people experiencing homelessness and wanting to find a way to help out, despite never carrying cash on her. As a rising college freshman, Halebeed developed a proposal for a cashless donation system, which she later submitted to the Reimagine Challenge 2020 last fall. Out of 838 submissions, Halebeed was one of the 20 winners. 
 While Halebeed — now a sophomore majoring in communication and specializing in applied analytics and innovation — has long wanted to help those experiencing homelessness, she said the pandemic made her idea for a cashless donation system even more necessary.  
As the coronavirus made people nervous to touch surfaces, Halebeed wanted to develop a touch-free solution similar to Venmo that could directly transfer money between people. She later realized not everyone had access to a mobile device to receive funds, so she thought of implementing QR codes.
 “It’s good to know that people think that the idea is important as we transition to a cashless society, which has its challenges, especially as it marginalizes certain communities — not just people experiencing homlessness, but also undocumented [people] and also people who rely on cash to pay less taxes, such as small businesses,” Halebeed said.
After talking with her father, JP Halebeed, when she first had the idea of creating a cashless donation system, he told her to look into companies already doing this. This led her to find Giving Streets.
 Giving Streets is an app launched in Greece that allows users to scan a QR code to donate directly to an organization. Halebeed said she found the app as a solution to donate to the houseless population in the United States, in hopes to encourage donations as the world moves into a cashless society. She messaged the founders of the app through LinkedIn two days after finding the company, and explained her idea to bring the app into U.S. app stores.
 Halebeed’s father said he is proud of his daughter’s accomplishment and what she has done so far with Giving Streets. JP said that when his daughter developed this project just before her freshman year at USC, he was there to ask her questions and get her thinking.
 “I [was] more of a sounding board, I would say. I would [ask] questions a lot … There are organizations that already [exist] … you don’t want to create another organization to do the same thing,” JP said.
 In September, Halebeed said she initially decided to enter the Reimagine Challenge — a challenge where university students submit solutions to movements or problems — after receiving an email about it from USC. After submitting a four-page short proposal, she was invited back to a second round in which she wrote a 12-page proposal outlining her idea. 
Halebeed proposed two stages in her paper. Stage one involves asking smaller businesses to place QR codes around their area for individuals to donate through the Giving Streets app to a partner organization helping those experiencing homelessness. Stage two involves implementing QR codes associated with specific people experiencing homelessness to receive the money directly.
 While Halebeed has reached out to multiple partnering organizations that have expressed interest in the first stage of her project, the Weingartz Center, an organization that builds and provides services for people experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles area, is her biggest partner so far.
 When reaching out to partnering organizations, Halebeed said she set up calls to discuss her proposal and received feedback from potential partners about implementing stage two.
 “I want to hear input [about stage two and donating directly to a person] — even if it’s negative input — because I obviously don’t want to put something into existence that’s going to harm the people I’m trying to help or the people that we’re trying to help,” Halebeed said. “I think the QR code solution directly to people is very tricky, but also really reliant on where the people are located.”
 For the second stage of her proposal, Halebeed also received help from USC professors, such as Tom Sloper, professor of information technology, who helped outlined her plan for this project, and Ali Rachel Pearl, who helped her think about the project’s ethical implications.
Pearl was Halebeed’s professor last spring, and Halebeed reached out to her through email in October. Halebeed asked for help with the legality of marketplaces for social enterprises and wanted referrals to professionals in the mobile payment or legal industries. 
“I stepped in and said, ‘I think before you go to that level, we should take a step back and think about the ethical considerations of this project,’” Pearl said. “‘Let’s actually talk about what this project is doing in relation to the unhoused community in ways that might potentially be harmful, even though it’s intended to be the opposite.’”
After Halebeed presented her project to Pearl, the two talked about design justice principles, Halebeed’s approach to community engagement, and discussed books and other resources that could be helpful for Halebeed’s idea.
“I love how invested she is in using her talents to address social issues,” Pearl wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I hope she continues to be curious about the most ethical ways to address the needs of a community she is not part of.” 
 Timothy Li, a part-time lecturer of information technology, is another one of Halebeed’s professors who provided guidance on her proposal. He said he believes Halebeed’s project deserves the attention of a wider audience and that Halebeed will lead the way in delivering resources to those in need. 
While Halebeed is glad she can help generate resources for individuals experiencing homelessness, she recognizes the issue itself stems from overarching problems such as systemic racism that require policy changes beyond the scope of the app. Halebeed said she hopes to have the Giving Streets App launched in the United States by the end of this year, starting with L.A. and later, Atlanta. 
“[My] long-term goal is for this business to not exist because that would mean that people aren’t experiencing homelessness and that we’ve gotten to a point where everyone has a house,” Halebeed said. “I don’t know how long that will take or if it will happen in my lifetime, if it’ll happen before the world dies out. But hopefully, at some point, everyone has a house if they want one.”
A previous version of this article misspelled Neha Halebeed’s last name as Halebleed. The correct spelling is Halebeed. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

In its final regular-season game of the season, No. 13 men’s tennis defeated No. 27 UCLA at Marks Stadium Saturday.
The Trojans were looking to complete the season sweep with the Bruins after defeating UCLA in both of their previous meetings. 
The game’s scheduling was hit with multiple delays, which slightly impacted the Trojans’ performance. It was originally scheduled for Friday, April 16th, but the teams mutually decided to postpone the match because of personal matters in the Bruins’ team. On Saturday, the match was delayed again from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. to get umpires.
The Trojans lost a doubles point out of the gates, with the duo of junior Jake Sands and freshman Lodewijk Weststrate quickly dropping their match against UCLA’s pair of senior Lucas Bellamy and junior Mathew Tsolakyan, by a score of 1-6. The strong partnership of sophomore Stefan Dostanic and junior Bradley Frye got the Trojans a win against UCLA junior Patrick Zahraj and senior Bryce Pereira, 6-3. 
It was up to the No. 5 doubles team in the nation, senior Daniel Cukierman and redshirt senior Riley Smith, to beat UCLA sophomore Drew Baird and junior Govind Nanda. Despite their efforts in a close match, Cukierman and Smith lost, giving the Bruins the doubles point to start the afternoon. 
“We didn’t play a great doubles point, I think because of our nerves,” head coach Brett Masi about the team’s initial performance in doubles. “But, in singles, we [the team] put that aside and we were ready to go.”
Masi’s group was ready after doubles as they dominated in singles play, with all Trojans winning in straight sets in their respective matchups against the Bruins, giving USC a resounding 6-1 overall victory. 
This game also marked senior day matches for two of the Trojans’ top performers this season, No. 29 Smith and No. 42 Cukierman. The highly-ranked duo ended the season on a strong note despite initially losing their doubles match. 
Smith faced Baird, and won 6-3, 6-4 while Cukeriman won in commanding fashion against No. 62 Nanda. 
Masi had nothing but praise for both Cukierman and Smith for their resilience in today’s matchup, as well as their impressive development during Masi’s two-year tenure at USC.
“I have known Riley [Smith] for 16 plus years … when I was the assistant and he was a kid you know,” Masi said about his time with Smith whose father, Peter Smith, was the former Trojans head coach and won five NCAA championships. “He’s an incredible dude [Riley Smith] and just very proud of him for what he’s become and who he is going to become in future years.”
Masi was similarly impressed with Cukierman’s progression and mentality over time.
“And then Daniel [Cukierman] … can’t say enough about his work ethic, his determination, sometimes it’s his detriment because he wants it so badly,” Masi said. “But, you know … good things come to those guys because they work so hard.”
The determination from both Cukierman and Smith as well as other members of USC during the singles matchups showed perseverance when it mattered most, earning the team their win. 
The Trojans will head down to San Diego to carry their momentum into the Pac-12 Tournament this weekend at the Barnes Tennis Center, April 23-26.
