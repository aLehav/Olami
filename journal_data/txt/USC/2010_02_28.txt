The NFL Combine is a time for draft prospects to impress professional scouts with their 40-yard dash times, broad jump heights, and bench press reps of 225 pounds.
For most NFL hopefuls, the performance put on by one halfback inside the weight room at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Saturday afternoon would typically be considered mediocre and uninspiring.
But as former USC running back Stafon Johnson lifted the bench press bar that almost took his life back in September, the number of times he lifted it in the air became far less significant than the mere fact that he was there.
In the five-month comeback since a freak weight room accident crushed his larynx and threatened his life, Johnson’s recovery has been nothing short of miraculous. From the determination in his whisper back in December, to the strength in his step at January’s Senior Bowl, to the passion he exhibited during his 13 reps on the bench press Saturday.
No one knows where the Trojans’  leading rusher from 2008 will end up in April’s draft, but one thing is for sure, whoever ends up drafting him is getting a rare individual — the kind whose greatest talents can’t be measured with a stop watch or measuring stick.
To measure the Compton native’s heart through a few numbers and statistics fails to really evaluate the heart and mind of an athlete whose sole presence on a football field is a victory of unimaginable proportions.
His 13 reps on the bench press were far fewer than the leading running back at the Combine (Ben Tate of Auburn had 26), but where he lacked in quantity, he made up for with an intangible that won’t likely make on the scouts’ reports: courage.

This news just in! If you’re looking to approach a handsome young man or woman, there is a new pick-up line to add to your artillery of one-liners — I want to suck your blood.
Although absolutely biologically repulsive, the idea of a blood-sucking night creature has taken hold of society as of late. Fans flock to watch Twilight movies, stay glued to HBO’s transmissions of True Blood and have overall generated a warm spot for fiends of the night.
This past Wednesday, the Academic Culture Assembly, spearheaded by director Susie Kwon, held a discussion entitled “Escapism in America: The Vampire Craze” to delve into what exactly makes the idea of these creatures so delicious. Led by School of Cinematic Arts professor David H. Balkan, the discussion brought together people of different backgrounds to probe into the phenomenon of vampires.
Surrounded by the bookshelves of Doheny’s Intellectual Commons, the semi-circle of congregated students — nibbling on pasta, salad and vampire-fighting garlic bread — learned of the history of vampirism. As Balkan revealed, the idea can be traced to Assyria, India and even the Aztecs and the Incas. Wearing a black, long-sleeved shirt, the professor traced the phenomenon from its beginnings centuries ago to the writings of Bram Stoker, Anne Rice and — of course — Stephenie Meyer. In media, the humanoid creatures appear in various shows, but were not always portrayed as sexy.
The first ever Dracula, as Balkan explains, was a “cadaverous-looking man,” far from the likes of the glittering Edward of present time. As he explains, Twilight is in fact a “sanitized approach” to the blood-sucking creatures and reads “almost squeaky clean.”
But no matter the style, vampires remain popular.
“We have always wanted to escape. We all harbor fantasies of some kind. You’re wanting something that seemingly is just beyond your fingertips. The fantasy is not grasping it but reaching for it … and that’s the allure of it,” Balkan said. “We are attracted to something maybe not in our best interest … some titillating, provocative thing.”
Indeed, vampires are the one thing that literally would be the death of humans — but, oh, what a sweet death.
The “Escapism in America” series will continue with two other programs dealing with superheroes and video games.

Several strong individual and team performances highlighted USC’s season-opening meet at the Rossi Relays in Claremont on a drizzly Saturday afternoon.  The team took home seven first-place finishes.
The USC women were especially strong.  Sophomore Aareon Payne and senior Shalina Clarke finished first and second, respectively, in the 100-meter dash. The women sprinters also dominated as a team, winning the 4×100, the 4×800, and the 4×1600 meter relays.
Sophomore Candace Bailey recorded a personal best in the women’s triple jump with a leap of 11.15 meters, one of only two USC women on the day to place first in an individual event.
Other notable performances from the women came in the hammer throw where Trojans Laura Chambers and Tamara Baumann finished second and third, respectively, with throws of over 50 meters each.
The USC men, expected to be one of the strongest teams in the country heading into the season, were shorthanded, declining to race some of its stronger competitors. Senior sprinter Ahmad Rashad did not run in the 100-meter dash, the race he finished second in during the NCAA Championships last year, echoing Director Ron Allice’s assertion that the Trojans “won’t run the best combinations until later in the season.”
Although the USC men did not run some of their best runners, they still showcased their depth in several strong events on Saturday. They had a one-two finish of their own, with Blake Shaw and John Carley finishing within a second of each other and taking the top two spots in the 3000-meter run. USC also took first place in the men’s 4×800-meter relay, and third in the 4×100 meter relay.
Several other strong performances highlighted USC’s day in Claremont. Senior hurdler Putchong Dispanurat took fourth in the 400-meter hurdles with a time of 58.29 seconds. Sophomore Thomas Parides was right behind him with a time of 59.29, finishing sixth in the race overall.
Senior jumper Aven Wright took home second in the men’s triple jump with a leap of 15.12 meters. Wright, who last year won the triple jump at the USC-UCLA dual meet, finished around a third of a meter behind Cal State Los Angeles’s Josh Como.
Other top-six finishes for USC came from sophomore Abe Markowitz in the men’s shot put (sixth overall), redshirt junior Tyler Grady in the men’s discus throw (fourth), and junior Trey Henderson in the men’s hammer throw.
Despite the absence of several marquee competitors, USC can expect to see more top-tier athletes in next week’s Jack Rose Relays in Cerritos, the next stop on USC’s outdoor season schedule. Earlier this week, Ron Allice said that the closer USC got to the Trojan Invitational on March 20, the more he would run his best combinations and shape the team to look more like the top-ten program he envisions it will be at the end of the season.

The government is pushing to get more veterans to take advantage of the benefits offered by the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, though the program was plagued by logistical problems in its initial year.
Tour of duty · Chris Roessner, a graduate student and a veteran, is currently receiving financial assistance from the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, which began this year, helps veterans fund their undergraduate or post-graduate education by covering tuition costs at any university equal to the cost of the most expensive public university in the state. Veterans attending private universities can often receive additional funds through the Yellow Ribbon Program, an opt-in program in which the school offers an additional scholarship at an amount the Department of Veterans Affairs agrees to match.
Because of debate over California’s tuition costs — originally determined to be $0 — schools at USC were hesitant to get involved with the G.I. Bill this year; only two of the graduate schools offered benefits through the Yellow Ribbon Program, though all undergraduates were eligible. Twenty undergraduate students and 17 graduate students at USC received Yellow Ribbon Program benefits this year.
Though the problem with California’s tuition costs was eventually settled, additional problems arose when veterans tried to get their benefits checks. Many checks did not come in time, and veterans were left wondering when they would get their promised money.
Yet, despite the chaos of the G.I. Bill’s inaugural year, USC is hoping to expand the program next year.
Robert Morley, associate registrar and tuition exchange liaison at USC, said problems with the bill and its late execution affected the ways in which the university was able to use it.
“The V.A. launched this program without really being prepared to execute it,” Morley said. “It was fairly chaotic. All of the rules and the regulations were not firmly established. The program got released so late that most schools had already set their financial aid budgets.”
The only USC graduate programs that participated in the Yellow Ribbon Program this year were the Rossier School of Education and the School of Social Work.
Morley said he is currently holding meetings with some of the graduate schools and the USC Financial Aid Office to discuss the future of this program.
“Right now I’m trying to contact other schools and determine their level of interest,” Morley said.
Morley said he believes more graduate schools will join the Yellow Ribbon Program next school year.
The V.A. has also launched an advertising campaign to make more veterans aware of the benefits available to them, but some at USC are not sure how effective this will be.
Jennifer Grodsky, executive director of the Office of Federal Relations, said she does not think awareness is necessarily the problem.
“The veterans I’ve met are all just incredibly savvy individuals, and a lot of them know about their benefits and are really smart about utilizing them,” Grodsky said. “My sense is that veterans really do know about the program. They may have questions about the details, but they know they’re entitled to a benefit and they’re excited about using it. The real focus should make sure that veterans are being helped.”
Julio Beltran, president of the USC Veterans Association, received money this year from the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill because of his six years of service in the Marines.
Beltran, who is a senior majoring in music industry, said the school receives about $3,000 dollars per semester from the V.A. for his tuition, in addition to the $1,500 he receives in housing stipends and the $400 he receives for books each semester.
Beltran also receives money through the USC Financial Aid Office in the form of scholarships, grants and loans.
“Right now, the most reliable form of financial aid is financial aid directly through USC,” he said.
Beltran said he thinks the proper course of action would be to send V.A. representatives to schools to speak with veterans and help them with the process of applying for and receiving their tuition.
Beltran said though the V.A. has improved slightly over the course of the school year in providing the students with their funds, it is far from flawless.
“I wouldn’t say it’s drastically improved,” Beltran said. “But it was definitely a big issue in the beginning of the school year.”
But Chris Roessner, a graduate student studying cinema-television production, disagreed.
Though he had initial problems with the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, Roessner said he is now very pleased with the benefits he is receiving.
“The first three months I didn’t get my military checks on time,” said Roessner, who served in Iraq from 2003 to 2004. “But now everything comes pretty much on time.”
Roessner said he receives slightly less than $3,000 a semester for tuition, $1,200 a month for rent and $300 a semester for books. He also receives money from the Financial Aid Office.
“I’ve had no problem paying for school,” Roessner said.
This semester, there are 201 active veterans at USC, including undergraduates and graduates. A large majority of these students receive money from the V.A., Morley said.
Though the Yellow Ribbon Program funded 20 undergraduates this year, there have been additional inquiries from approximately 40 veterans.
Beltran hopes more veterans will be able to attend USC if the V.A. becomes more organized and starts issuing the money in more a timely basis.
“I think there could be a more targeted effort to recruit veterans to USC,” Beltran said.
Morley said that USC plans on participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program again next year and believes that veterans will continue to apply for federal aid.
“We’re hopeful that this year will go much more smoothly,” he said.
That would be the VETERAN’s ADMINISTRATION, not association.

The devastating 8.8-magnitude earthquake that struck Chile this weekend, killing more than 700 people, hit close to home for many members of the USC community, particularly four USC students studying abroad in Santiago who had been there less than two weeks and students with family in Chile.
The four USC students, Andres Blumer, a junior majoring in international relations (global business); Kaitlin King, a junior majoring in anthropology; Marianna Singwi-Ferrono, a junior majoring in Spanish and international relations; and Ryan Soderberg, a junior majoring in business administration, survived uninjured, but said the hours after the quake hit Santiago were dizzying. Because phone and power lines were out, the members of the group had a hard time communicating with each other and with their families in the United States.
For students with family members in Chile, communication was just as difficult. Cell phone lines were down, and many residents of Chile do not have land lines.
Answers trickled in slowly for both groups.
The four students verified that everyone in the group was OK but only after driving around Santiago to find each other. Students in Los Angeles confirmed their family members’ safety but only after long hours wrought with anxious anticipation. And though their immediate questions were answered and their concerns quelled, for many there is still a felling of uncertainty.
Experiencing history abroad
The city of Santiago, north of the earthquake’s epicenter, is at a relative standstill. Residents are staying in, buildings are damaged, roads are closed and public transportation is down. The four students, who have been in Chile less than two weeks, are not sure when they’ll return to school, when they’ll be able to use their cell phones again and, for some of them, when they will have power.
Just more than 24 hours ago, the city was shaking.
Blumer, one of the four students in Chile, was staying at an apartment in a Santiago suburb, north of the earthquake’s epicenter. He was sleeping peacefully, he said, until the shaking began.
The walls shook. The floor rumbled. The sound of glass breaking was muffled by the screeches of car alarms going off all down the street. Blumer had to hold on to avoid crashing to the floor. Amid the chaos of the 8.8-magnitude earthquake that struck the coast of Chile early Saturday morning, the four USC students studying abroad found themselves thrust into a the heart of disaster.
The students are all living in separate homes in the suburbs of Santiago. Waking up to the earth’s violent shaking, they were forced to navigate the catastrophe with no power, no familiar faces and with few people who spoke their native language.
Blumer said his neighbors gathered to make sure everyone was accounted for, but everyone was speaking fast and with an accent it couldn’t quite cut through. Even the radio news, he said, “was all very fast and in Spanish so hard for me to understand.”
He did not know the full extent of the damage until the electricity came back later in the morning and he could turn on the news.
Cell phone lines were also down, and other members of the group could not reach Blumer.
“My host family and I drove to Andres Blumer’s house to make sure he was safe, since I couldn’t reach him by phone,” Soderberg wrote in an e-mail. “I was happy to find him smoking a cigarette with the rest of his apartment building.”
Blumer, who was lucky enough to get Internet and power back within a few hours of the earthquake, e-mailed his parents and the parents of the other students in Chile to assure them that everyone was OK.
Although the situation became clearer as the day went on and worry turned to relief as the students connected with each and their families, the chaos did not end there.
Aftershocks, some reaching magnitudes above 6.5, continued to shake the city. Power remained out in many areas, and students were told to stay in their houses. Most of the city’s police force has been called to areas that have been worse hit and the city has become prone to crime.
Though Santiago fared better than other areas, Blumer said, the news reports have put the disaster in context for the four USC students.
“It’s just starting to hit me that we … just lived through history,” Blumer wrote.
A world away
They got the news first by phone.
Natalia Bogolasky Fliman, a graduate student studying journalism, first heard from her friend in New York, who had been on the phone with someone in Chile at the time the earthquake hit. Cristina Pandol, a senior majoring in psychology, got the CNN news update on her cell phone.
The news came first, but information about their family members came later.
Pandol said she first called her mom, who had been trying to get in touch with family members. Pandol began calling too, but because cell phones were down it took an hour and a half before she got to anyone.
“I was lucky I could talk to my dad only an hour or an hour and a half after the earthquake happened and I could hear from him and he was okay,” she said.
Bogolasky Fliman was able to reach her family within an hour and a half, she said, and verified that everyone was OK.
Both natives of Chile, Bogolasky Fliman and Pandol said earthquakes are a common occurrence, but this one was different.
“This is huge,” Bogolasky Fliman said. “Even though if you grow up in Chile you’re used to waking up in the middle of the night with tremors, this was stronger and longer.”
But Chile’s history of earthquakes, Pandol said, might have been what helped keep so many people safe.
In 1960, a catastrophic 9.6-magnitude earthquake struck Chile. Since then, earthquake preparedness has been a priority for the country.
“Anything that would have fallen fell in 1960, and anything that’s been built since then has had top-notch earthquake stability,” Pandol said. “Everything has been to prepare for another 9.6 and this was an 8.8, which is still really large, but it’s not a 9.6 and we’ve been preparing for a 9.6 since 1960 … Everyone knows what to do.”
Although Pandol’s and Bogolasky Fliman’s friends and family survived unharmed, Pandol said some of her family members are still lacking water, gas and power.
Two of Pandol’s aunts live in Santiago, but only one has power. The two families have banded together, bathing in one’s swimming pool, since there is still no water.
Still, Pandol and Bogolasky Fliman are grateful their families were not further south, close to Concepción.
“Some highways in [Santiago] are damaged, some of my friends’ houses are really damaged, but in Santiago it’s not as bad as cities in the south like Concepción,” Bogolasky Fliman said. “Things are really far from being normal but it’s not as bad as it is in the South.”
The road ahead
The earthquake has left 700 dead and two million displaced so far. Roads are closed and power and gas lines still down. The aftershocks have faded, but the uncertainty is only growing.
The four USC students have found their experience changed dramatically, and there’s no indication as to when it might return to a comfortable routine.
“Things right now are pretty crazy as people are vandalizing and ransacking supermarkets,” Soderberg wrote. “The U.S. Embassy has notified us saying that we are not allowed to leave Santiago. My host family says I am only allowed to leave during the day.”
Tracey Seslen, an assistant professor of clinical finance and business economics who has lived in Chile and traveled there with student groups, said the country will rebound once the initial shock has passed.
“In my opinion, Chile is the most first-world of the countries in Latin America,” Seslen said. “I think they’re going to recover from this in a fairly short period of time.”
That recovery time might not be quick enough for the group of USC Marshall School of Business students slated to head to Chile over spring break to make their trip, however.
“There’s a group of freshmen in [Learning about International Commerce (LINC) Program] going to be going over spring break, and I would bet that they’re not going to be able to go,” Seslen said. “I saw pictures of the airport, which I’ve been to many, many times, and it looked like a disaster area.”
The students in the program don’t know any more than what they have heard on the news. Several students said they hadn’t heard anything from the program, and one had spoken with the organizer but still didn’t have a definitive answer.
Despite the questions that remain, the USC students with family in Chile and those studying abroad in Chile said they are simply thankful that the worst has passed.
“It is great to know that the Trojan Family exists outside of USC,” Soderberg wrote.
Correction: Tracey Seslen was originally identified as Teresa Selsen.

A USC student was killed and another injured on Saturday after their car collided head on with another vehicle in Kern County.
Sandy Roberts, a sophomore majoring in cinema-television production, was killed after the car he was riding in passed a truck, lost control and veered into oncoming traffic on highway 46. Roberts died after being transported to Kern Medical Center.
Nicole Deane, who was driving the car and is a sophomore majoring in cinema-television production, was airlifted to KMC, and is in stable condition.
Deane was driving east on the highway near Annette Street at about 7:30 p.m. when she crashed into a westbound vehicle going 55 or 60 mph, according to police. Deane was trying to steer the car back into the eastbound lanes after passing the truck, but she lost control, police said.
“Our hearts go out to the families of those involved and the family of the deceased student,” said James Grant, head of USC’s media relations. “Nothing prepares us for this kind of thing and it’s always a shock to us.”
Counseling will be available to students who need it, Grant said.
For those who would like to learn a little bit more about Sandy Roberts please go to http://www.sandyroberts.org.
I taught Sandy in high school and knew him well throughout his four years.  It was never about Sandy but always about everyone else.  He was the most selfless human being, determined to bring sunshine and laughter into everyone’s lives.  When someone was in need, there he was, never asked to help but always there.  His smile was contagious and ever present.  I often wondered how so much love and generosity could be within one young man.  I feel like one of the fortunate ones to have known him closely and chosen to be the recipient of his kindness and good will.  Talent was abundant and inherent to this shining star.  I think not of what he could have been, but of what he already was.  Sandy, you touched our lives, everyone who was blessed to have known you….a hero, an icon, and a model of what all young people should be.  You will be remembered every day for your contribution to humanity.  I know you are continuing to bring joy to those around you now.  Dr. C.
There is no way to measure how great a tragedy this is.   To see a young man with so much ahead of him lost in just a moment.   Our hearts ache for his family.
going through highschool with Sandy was nothing short of a priviledge.
I hadn’t spoken to him in a while, but he ALWAYS came up in conversation with people– I always said “yeah I got this friend who i sjust SO cool and amazing! you’ll see him getting an oscar one day! and there will I be cheering him on, all excited!” — O even spoke about him a few days ago. it’s funny how things like that happen… you meet someone and they leave an everlasting print on your heart and soul. Sandy did that for me and many others. I’m just glad he lived his life to the fullest until the very end…
I just still can’t grasp the concept that he is no longer here…to his family, take with you all the love from everyone who was touched by Sandy. his had an unique light about him that made everything shine when he was around. he was truly something else.
Oh goodness, no words can express how sorry I am for both families.  This highway intersection is very close to where James Dean was killed, why haven’t they fixed this route in over 50 years?
This is surreal, too painful to fully comprehend. We parents may be older and allegedly wiser but there’s still no understanding why tragedies like this occur, especially to someone with early success in life and such promise for the future.
I, too, met Sandy and Nicole through my daughter, a sophomore at USC and a member of their close-knit group. It sounds like everyone wanted to be Sandy’s friend. I always enjoyed hearing stories about Sandy’s exploits in The Merry Men, his triumphant group win in last year’s Ed Wood Film Festival, his wonderful personality and sense of humor.
To Nicole’s family, we wish you a quick physical recovery and emotional strength in the coming months as you adjust to this terrible loss in your life. To Sandy’s family, we cannot begin to imagine what you are going through but we think of you continually. May your memories sustain you during this painful time.  It is evident that your son touched and impacted many lives. Please know how much Sandy’s friendship meant to our daughter. He leaves a permanent hole in her heart.
my heart goes out to his friends, family and nicole.  Sandy was my Spanish student a year ago. He was an unforgettable student that always gave great energy to the group. I will always remember his presence…
It is with great sadness that I learned of Sandy’s passing. It is truly tragic and the entire family is devastated. Being his uncle and in the film industry in Orlando, I was so proud of him being selected to the USC film school and was looking forward to being a mentor and collaborating on projects that would stir his imagination as he developed his production skills and learned new ways to express his creativity. We were looking forward to visiting the NAB trade show in April, no doubt an exciting venue to any 21 year old intent on absorbing everything about film and broadcast. I can’t imagine how those of you in the USC film school must feel to have lost such a friend. It is so unfortunate that we shall never know the true extent of just how Sandy might have touched us all.
It’s horrific!
Sandy was such a fun, caring and smart child.   With all the children I’ve coached over the years and the kids from Temple Sandy stands out.  To Mom and Dad, Mimi and Scott…all our syDmpathy and condolences.  To Zach, there’s NO answers, just be strong and focus on your education…laugh like your brother would want you to.  I hope to learn of the arrangements made.  To Nicole, her friends and family, a speedy recovery.
BTW…here in South FLA we don’t have any 2 lane highways where we can go 55 mph, so it’s hard to understand the terrain there.  If there was a mapquest/GPS that took them that route, OMG!
I too went to summer camp with Sandy in Montreal. He was the most amazing person I have ever met. He was always sweet, caring, open-minded and himself to everyone. My heart and thoughts are with his family and friends. I’m sure anyone who’s met Sandy sends their condolences and thoughts as well.
Ive known sandy for about seven years now. He and I were in a small 7 person tv production class in which his skills put him in another category. 2 summers ago we were in the same internship at the city of miami beach communication department. Words cannot express how empty I feel right now. I loved him and i will miss him forever. Rest in peace my friend, ill see you soon enough.
I am terribly saddened by the tragic passing of Sandy. I went to camp with Sandy many years ago in Montreal, Canada. He was a happy go-lucky camper and he was always fun to be around. My thoughts and prayers are with the Roberts family.
I’m so incredibly sad for Nicole, Sandy, and their families and friends. Such a terribly unfortunate loss of life. May his soul rest in peace. I wish swift healing to all affected
I went to camp with Sandy years ago in Montreal, Canada, heard the terrible news from a friend. He was such a lively, fun-loving person. He will be missed by those whose lives he touched.
If you knew Sandy, he was one of the nicest loving people you will ever meet. I just dont understand why of all people it had to be him. Class of 08 will never be the same. We love you sandy!
I’m from Kern County and this highway is well known for its high number of fatal car accidents.  Unfortunately, people from out of town don’t know this when they type addresses into Google Maps or their GPS devices and take the 2 lane highway inland thinking it’s shorter than taking the 101 the entire way.
My heart goes out to the students family, hopefully more awareness can be raised about this incredibly dangerous high way.
We met Nicole and Sandy through our USC student. Lovely, lovely  kids. This is too sad, beyond belief.  Our hearts and prayers go out to Sandy’s family… please know how much we liked him immediately when we met him….and to Nicole and her family,  and to their friends who also love them, both at home and at USC, who have been so deeply touched by this tragic, horrible  loss.
On behalf of the USC Hillel Foundation, we are deeply saddened by this tragic loss.  Our hearts go out to Sandy’s friends and family.
All of his friends in Fort Lauderdale are devastated by this news. He was a member of the Improv Troupe Child’s Play and was loved by many. The world has lost a shining star. My sympathy to his parents.
god rest his soul.
People in Nashville who are friends of Nicole are devastated by this news.  She is a great person.  For people who are “wondering,” she is a totally responsible person.  People who met him here said he was a wonderful person.  She and Sandy were very happy together.  We can but sit beside Sandy’s family on their mourning bench.  Nothing prepares a parent for this terrible, terrible moment.
I am so, so sorry for the families and friends of both students
why was the student driving on the westbound side of the road if they were going eastbound?
Can’t you read?
Student2, no need to be rude. Student, she was driving on the westbound side of the road in order to pass the truck that was undoubtedly going quite slow. The act is perfectly legal on a two-lane highway. Unfortunately, she lost control in her attempt to come back to her lane.
[…] Sandy Roberts, a sophomore, died Saturday after he was airlifted to Kern Medical Center, according to The Daily Trojan […]

The No. 9 USC swimming and diving team fought its way into third place this week in the ultra-competitive Pac-10 conference, overtaking No. 4 Arizona with 1298.5 points to claim its best Pac-10 championship result since 2003.

Bay Area rivals No. 1 Stanford (1489) and No. 5 California (1341) took first and second, respectively, followed by USC and then Arizona (1223.5).
“Overall, it was an outstanding meet to be a Trojan,” senior co-captain Krissy Forelli said.
Following a Pac-10 victory last year, USC sophomore diver Victoria Ishimatsu claimed two Pac-10 titles on both the 1-meter (332.80) and 3-meter (381.15) events. Ishimatsu was named diver of the meet. Freshmen teammate Ariel Rittenhouse claimed second in the 1-meter (366.60) and third in the 3-meter (326.25).
“[Ishimatsu] dominated the event with confidence and consistency,” USC diving coach Hongping Li said. “Ariel dove beautifully as well in a tight and close contest with her teammate.”
The women started off the first night of competition with a bang, winning the 800-yard freestyle relay in 6:59.48 and crushing their school record of 7:07.59. The team was made up of juniors Presley Bard and Lyndsay DePaul and freshmen Haley Anderson and sophomore Katinka Hosszu. Bard led off the relay with a 1:44.47, breaking Hosszu’s school record (1:45.22) in the process.
“The 800 free relay was amazing. Berkeley has won the event for the past six years straight, and we broke that pattern,” senior co-captain Dina Hegazy said.
USC led the Pac-10 into day two of the conference and continued to blow its competition out of the water. Three more school records were smashed, the first by Hosszu in the 200-yard individual medley (1:55.49), another by Bard in the 50-yard freestyle (22.26) and the final by the women’s 200-yard freestyle (1:31.45) relay, which consisted of Hosszu and freshmen Lindsay Parrish, Christel Simms and Kate Shumway.
By day three, USC was ranked third and was determined to remain in the top three in one of the toughest conferences in the nation. The women made six finals appearances, including Bard who became the first Woman of Troy to claim a Pac-10 100-yard backstroke final with a time of 51.92.
DePaul broke USC’s 100-yard fly record twice during Friday’s session, first in preliminaries (52.04) and then in the finals (51.86) where she came third.
Saturday marked the last day of competition, and the Women of Troy showed no signs of slowing down. Bard touched first in the 200-yard backstroke (1:51.80) and erased Hegazy’s school record (1:53.27), which she recorded at last year’s        Pac-10’s. Hegazy came fourth in the event in a time of 1:55.63.
The most exciting event of the meet was arguably Saturday’s 200-yard butterfly final, when USC dominated half the start list with four women competing in the eight-person final.
“It was the last event of the meet, and we had all the stands just cheering for USC; it was just inspirational,” Hegazy said. “Everybody was just behind the blocks screaming so hard for the girls.”
Hosszu won the event in 1:52.71, winning her first title of the conference. Stanford’s Elaine Breeden (1:53.15) and USC’s DePaul (1:53.88) came second and third, respectively.
The conference marked the last Pac-10 championships for team captains Hegazy and Forelli.
“I’m so glad this was my last          Pac-10’s. I ended on a great team, and I couldn’t ask for more,” Hegazy said. “It’s been a pleasure and an honor being part of this team.”
“I think I speak for the entire team that we are really looking forward to next year with an even stronger team that will challenge for a Pac-10 team championship title and a run to the top of the NCAA championships,” USC coach Dave Salo said.

Playing their only home tournament of the season, the No. 16 USC men’s golf team will host some of the nation’s top teams Monday and Tuesday at the USC Collegiate Invitational at North Ranch Country Club in Westlake Village, Calif.
The Trojans are looking to bounce back from a ninth-place finish at the Mauna Lani Invitational on the Big Island of Hawaii in early February.
“We were frustrated with our play in Hawaii, especially since we had a terrible final round,” freshman Martin Trainer said.
The Trojans have had more than three weeks to hone their games and prepare for their home event since returning to the mainland. The team has played practice rounds at the North Ranch Country Club course the past three Fridays.
“We’re very, very familiar with this golf course as a program,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “Course knowledge helps, so when we get to go to a place where we really know the golf course, we look at it as a big opportunity to get a win.”
USC has won its home tournament four times, with its last victory in 2008.
The Trojans will face stiff competition from the other 13 teams in the tournament. Defending champion Stanford, ranked No. 2 in the nation, comes in as favorites. No. 11 UCLA, No. 13 Arizona State, No. 15 Oregon State, No. 17 Oregon and No. 18 California are the other top 25 teams in the Pac-10-heavy field.
Zambri believes, however, the course plays right into the strengths of his team.
“It’s not a big bash fest where you’re just smashing it all over the place,” Zambri said about the North Ranch course. “You’ve got to play smart golf, you’ve got to stay on the right side of the hole and you’ve got to chip and putt great. I think it really fits their game.”
Zambri made one change to his lineup since Hawaii, inserting freshman T.J. Vogel into the squad for this week in place of fellow freshman Sam Smith.
“T.J.’s a bigger ball striker, and he’s a guy that we really need in the top five,” junior Matt Giles said. “He’s posted a few good scores lately, so we’re excited to have him back in the lineup.”
Giles, a two-time All-American, has struggled to find his top form this season and finished in a tie for 29th in Hawaii.
“I feel like my chipping and putting are pretty good but my ball striking hasn’t been up to the level that I’d like it to be,” Giles said. “I’m trying to get back to basics and just go out and enjoy golf and let things come to me.”
Sophomore Steve Lim and Trainer have been two of USC’s more consistent players this season. Trainer’s tie for 21st in Hawaii was the highest finish of any Trojan that week.
“Chipping and putting are gonna be key, especially at this course with the small and undulating greens,” he said. “They’re gonna be really fast in this tournament.”
Trainer said, although there will be more distractions playing close to home, the Trojans are approaching this event like any other.
“We’re gonna have friends and boosters and supporters there,” Trainer said. “But in the end it’s a tournament just like any other we’re there to win.”
Redshirt junior Bo DeHuff rounds out the lineup for USC this week.
Zambri said the Trojans are going to use their home tournament, which features 36 holes of play Monday and the final round Tuesday, to launch their season into top gear.
“We need to get going this year, and this would be the best time to do it ­— our home course, our home tournament, with some guys that really like the golf course on our team,” Zambri said. “We’re looking forward to a good couple of days.”

Being tired sucks.
Your outlook on everything changes. Your productivity, your efficiency, your excitement — they all go down. All you want to do is finish your day and get to sleep.
But sometimes you can’t.
Sometimes you’ve got class from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., work until midnight and a few hours of homework to do before you repeat it all again the next day.
That’s what the USC men’s basketball team is feeling like right about now.
And quite frankly, it was apparent in the Trojans’ play Saturday — not that it was their fault. The team has fought valiantly all season long and truly never given up. Something that should be commended, especially given the circumstances.
But, man, are they tired.
Eight players playing 27 close games over the course of three months will do that.
It’s easy to forget the Trojans compete with at least a man or two less than their opponents nearly every game. The typical rotation in college basketball features maybe 10 or 11 guys playing each night; USC hasn’t used more than eight in one game since Dec. 5.
Part of that is because the Trojans’ top eight is clearly separated from the rest of the players by talent and experience. But part of it is also because their games have been so tight that there hasn’t been any garbage time.
The only reason USC coach Kevin O’Neill got to empty out his bench a little bit in December was because the Trojans were getting blown out by Georgia Tech. But USC has only lost by more than 10 points on two occasions this season — and it’s not like its blowing out teams either.
The Trojans haven’t won by more than five points since more than a month ago in Washington.
And that’s not to mention the fact that the team has no real motivation. Since the university’s self-imposed sanctions on the basketball program, banning the team from any sort of postseason play this season, the team has known its season would end on March 6 — definitively.
Add it all up, and you’ve got one tired group of teenagers and 20-somethings.
And they finally admitted it this weekend.
“We did feel a little tired,” sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic said after Saturday’s demoralizing 49-44 loss to Oregon State. “And we don’t have a lot of rotation, so the time accumulates and we get worn out and we can’t keep up the same intensity for 40 minutes.”
But at the same time, Vucevic hesitated to blame the loss on a collective lethargy.
“That is a factor, but it’s not an excuse,” Vucevic said. “Because every team plays the same amount of games, so everybody’s tired.”
O’Neill, in his first year at USC, has said all along that his roster was lacking in depth.
After his team blew chances to win Feb. 20 against Washington State and Thursday against Oregon, he said the team was starting to “wear down.”
“It showed in the Washington State game and again tonight,” O’Neill said Thursday.
But Saturday, his viewpoint had changed after a fundamentally unsound performance from his team. USC couldn’t buy a bucket in the second half, and Oregon State’s respected 1-3-1 half-court trap mystified the Trojan backcourt.
Asked if he still thought the Trojans looked tired afterward, he sounded even more frustrated.
“I can’t even tell anymore,” he said. “Tired’s not an excuse for 20 turnovers. Tired’s not an excuse for shooting 29 percent. It’s who we are, and it’s unfortunate for our fans and unfortunate for everybody.”
You know what? That excuse might actually fly, Mr. O’Neill. Ask any student who’s been through one of those 9 a.m.-4 p.m., 4 p.m.-midnight, midnight-who-knows-when-type of days, and you’ll get more than a little sympathy.
As I said, being tired sucks. It’s not fun in the least. And tired people consistently make mistakes, whether it’s in the classroom, workplace or on the basketball court.
So get some sleep, will you?

The Women of Troy escaped Oregon with two wins, capping off their road sweep with a narrow 53-50 victory over the Oregon State Beavers Saturday afternoon at Gill Coliseum in Corvallis, Ore.
Clutch · Sophomore guard Ashley Corral hit two big free throws late in Saturday’s game at Oregon State to secure the win for USC. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The Women of Troy (16-11, 10-6) were active on the defensive end of the floor in the first half, limiting the Beavers (9-18, 1-15) to 16 percent shooting from the field.
They also limited guard Talisa Rhea and guard Haiden Palmer — the Beavers’ two leading scorers — to a combined eight points on 3-17 shooting in the first half.
“One of the things we emphasized going into the game was defense. We just wanted to bring the intensity and let our defense create our offense,” senior guard Heather Oliver said.
The Beavers, however, did manage to get to the free-throw line 10 times during the first 20 minutes, which kept the game relatively close during the first half.
With their defense creating opportunities on the offensive end, the Women of Troy went into halftime leading 28-19.
Things changed in the second half as the Beavers managed to make it a game, going on a 16-7 run and tying the score at 35 apiece midway through.
That’s as close as the Beavers would get, as the Women of Troy would not relinquish their lead.
“We knew coming into this game that it was going to be hard. We weren’t nervous and we knew it was going to be a challenge, but we just really wanted to win this game,” Oliver said. “It was our will to win that carried us through.”
After the Beavers tied it up, it was Oliver who started a 12-4 run that, with two free throws and a key 3-pointer, would put the Women of Troy up 47-39 with about 6:30 left to play.
But the Beavers would not quit.
The Women of Troy were held scoreless for the next three minutes as the Beavers managed to make it a two-point game at 49-47 with just over a minute remaining.
Beavers’ forward Christina Marinacci sank a baseline jumper on the next possession to push the lead to four points, but Rhea hit a 3-pointer to cut the deficit to a single point with just under 30 seconds to go.
With the Women of Troy up 51-50, sophomore guard Ashley Corral was fouled, and she calmly sank both free throws to extend the lead to three points.
And from there, the Women of Troy breathed a sigh of relief as they watched the Beavers miss two 3-point shots in the final seconds.
“I was a bit nervous, but I knew [we would] get the job done,” Oliver said. “It was nerve-wracking, but it was good to come out of Oregon State with a win.”
The Women of Troy were led by Oliver’s 18 points.
Meanwhile, for the Beavers, Rhea and Palmer both chipped in 11 points but had to work for every point as they combined to shoot just 6-33 from the field.
“Briana [Gilbreath] did a great job on [Rhea],” Oliver said. “We knew she’s a great shooter and we just wanted to shut her down and I think we did a great job of doing that.”
The Women of Troy return home for their final two games of the regular season to face Arizona and Arizona State starting Thursday.

Not surprisingly, the Trojans played excellent defense for most of the night. But in what has become an all-too-familiar scene, they fell flat on their faces on the other side of the ball.
Old guard · Senior guard Mike Gerrity led the Trojans with 13 points in his final appearance at the Galen Center during Senior Night on Saturday. The departing Trojans received a standing ovation from the crowd.  - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Even on Senior Night, the USC men’s basketball team couldn’t muster enough energy to bounce back from a 10-point loss two days earlier to Oregon. The Trojans (16-12, 8-8) fell victim to yet another poor second-half effort, shooting a dismal 29 percent from the field and falling, 49-44 to Oregon State (13-15, 7-9) on Saturday at the Galen Center.
“Definitely not the way I envisioned us going out,” said senior guard Mike Gerrity, who led USC with 13 points on 4 of 12 shooting in his final home game.
Gerrity, senior guard Dwight Lewis, senior forward Marcus Johnson and redshirt junior forward Kasey Cunningham, who has decided not to return next season after multiple knee injuries, received a standing ovation in the pregame ceremony honoring the Trojans’ outgoing players.
But after Oregon State center Roeland Schaftenaar drained four late free throws and USC missed multiple last-minute shots, a hushed crowd at the Galen Center immediately headed for the exits.
“It was disappointing how the game turned out,” Lewis said. “You don’t want to leave a beautiful stadium with a loss.”
Like so many other teams, Oregon State struggled to put up points against the Trojans. But USC had even more issues facing the Beavers’ pesky zone defense, squandering an early 11-point lead and making just five shots in the second half.
“The zones we’ve come against have been active, getting in passing lanes and contesting shots and making us [commit] a lot of turnovers,” Lewis said.
When asked whether fatigue played a factor in the outcome, USC coach Kevin O’Neill didn’t have a definitive answer, saying instead that being tired would not pass as an excuse for the team’s poor play
The Trojans certainly looked tired for much of the game. Careless cross-court passes led to turnovers and easy scores for the Beavers. Shots caromed off the rim. Missed layups turned into fast break opportunities for Oregon State.
Though his coach and teammates wouldn’t admit the same, sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic agreed that USC was beginning to feel the toll of a physical season.
“We did feel a little tired and we don’t have a lot of rotations, so as time accumulated, we get worn out and we can’t keep up the same intensity for 40 minutes,” Vucevic said.
Other than Gerrity, only Lewis managed to score more than six points, finishing with 11. Sophomore forward Leonard Washington had six points and eight rebounds.
For the Beavers, guard Seth Tarver led all scorers with 14 points, making 6 of 9 shots from the field. Guards Calvin Haynes and Josh Tarver added eight points apiece.
USC entered halftime with a 25-24 lead. Sloppy play was an early trend for both teams, with the Trojans committing 12 turnovers and Oregon State giving up nine of its own before the break.
The Beavers seized control early in the second half, opening with an 11-4 run to take the lead for good. Gerrity’s layup with 34 seconds remaining cut the deficit to 46-44, but from there Oregon State closed out the game at the free-throw line.
“You’re supposed to win at home if you only give up 49 points,” O’Neill said. “We just didn’t get it done.”
With two games left, the Trojans will attempt to salvage what little remains of their season this week on the road against the Arizona schools. California defeated Arizona State on Saturday, ending USC’s hopes of earning a share of the Pac-10 regular season title.
“I think we got a bounce-back in us — one last one,” Lewis said.

The Los Angeles County Museum of Art boasts that its new exhibit Renoir in the 20th Century offers an unprecedented look at the world-renowned French Impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir through the unorthodox perspective of modernism, claiming that the exhibition closes the perceived gap between art of the 19th and 20th centuries.
“The Concert” · Known for his modernist explorations of female sexuality, Renoir’s later works incorporated more classical styles and themes. The exhibit Renoir in the 20th Century displays pieces that exemplify this shift. - Photo courtesy of LACMA 
The exhibit, which will be open until May 9, is LACMA’s first monographic study dedicated almost exclusively to Renoir, and the first in the world since 1985. It covers the last 30 years of Renoir’s painting career when his painting style veered off of the modern, progressive path and focused more on nude paintings, portraiture, fantastic “Orient” paintings and works inspired by classical mythology.
The exhibit showcases Renoir’s sculptures, drawings, family photos and even a silent video of Renoir in his studio.
Alongside the remarkable Renoir pieces on display in the new exhibit, LACMA is also showcasing works by artists who were inspired by Renoir’s late work — Matisse, Bonnard, Maillol and Picasso included.
Many of the pieces on display, including a sculpture of the artist’s son Claude, were never intended to be seen by the public. The various sculptures that are spread through the exhibit range from the basic (“Coco”) to the very elaborate, as seen in his decorative clock, “Hymn to Life,” which pays homage to classical decorative arts by depicting a mythological scene of nymph–like nudes. His drawings — most of which were intended strictly as studies for subsequent paintings and were not meant to be displayed as finished products — are placed next to studies by Maillol. Some of the Maillol studies were clearly influenced by Renoir’s nude sketches.
The exhibit follows the work of Renoir after the Impressionistic peak of his career. It acknowledges the time when Renoir was a leader in the battles of Impressionism, but the art displayed dates after 1880, when he began to distance himself from Impressionism and wanted to return to a style that was more classical and free. Although his subjects are shown in modern contexts, his depictions of them are inspired by works of the great masters like Titian and are heavily influenced by mythology.
While many artists at the time either used their art to remark on turmoil or decided to make progressive changes within the medium, Renoir’s paintings retreated to fantasy and innocence. He said that pain disappears, but beauty endures, a perspective that shines through some of his most famous scenes, which are present at the exhibit.
From “Two Young Girls at the Piano,” which depicts a calm musical scene to “The Artist’s Son Jean Drawing,” which was inspired by Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin’s 18th century paintings of childhood innocence, the exhibit shows pieces that were technically old-fashioned in their own time. Nonetheless, these are pieces that art appreciators must take into account when discussing Renoir.
Renoir’s nudes are another main focus of the exhibit, which emphasizes that Renoir was a pioneer in setting the classic “old master” style nude in modern settings. Rather than associating the nude woman with a mythological or biblical tale, Renoir’s nudes are depicted doing ordinary chores. Although Renoir wanted to abstain from modernism, his nudes are displayed in modern settings but appear oddly timeless.
The exhibit is spread between nine spacious, white rooms that reflect the light, airy quality of Renoir’s work. Although the rooms aren’t completely dissimilar from one another, they each attempt a sort of theme — nudes, drawings, portraiture, etc. The final room is occupied by the painting that Renoir considered his masterpiece titled “The Great Bathers (The Nymphs).” The exhibit suggests that this painting hasn’t garnered much respect because it wasn’t at all progressive. While history has considered barrier–breaking works of the time to be more important, “The Great Bathers” is a throwback to nudes of the previous centuries that were depicted in lush outdoorsy settings.
The works in the exhibit have been acquired from across the globe — Paris, Philadelphia, Tokyo, New York — yet all contribute to a cohesive representation of Renoir’s late and often ignored work. By the turnout of visitors, however, it seems as if some of these pieces are finally regaining recognition.
Renoir is quoted as saying, “Why shouldn’t art be pretty? There are enough unpleasant things in the world.” His view of art is exemplified throughout the exhibit, which displays his work that was truly intended to be beautiful above all else. LACMA makes it a point to explain that these paintings have often been underappreciated because of their distance from modernity and the cultural changes of the time; however, the work of Renoir’s last 30 years was influential on modern artists and beautiful in its own right.
Terrific article. Very thorough. I caught this exhibit and it IS wonderful and so very ‘newsworthy’. Thank you. I was also very touched by seeing the film footage of Renoir, his crippled arthritic hands, painting in his studio… LACMA is a Gem and has done a fine job presenting this period of Renoir’s life and works. Don’t miss it.

On the eve of London’s Chinese New Year celebration, Trafalgar Square stood empty. Standing at the top steps of the National Gallery, I relished this rarity, knowing full well that by noon the next day, every inch of the concrete-covered Downtown space — which is around the same size as Los Angeles’ Pershing Square — would be occupied.
I took the bus early the next afternoon, only to be diverted by routes altered for the day’s festivities. Stranded by public transportation and a haywire sense of direction, I looked like a USC freshman trying to find the Coliseum for the first time and decided to just to just follow the crowd.
But it wasn’t the sound of firecrackers or the Caucasian man dressed in traditional Chinese garb that alerted me of my proximity to the event. From about a quarter of a mile away, I could hear string instrumentals and high-pitched Beijing opera music blasting from the stage.
As soon as I stepped foot on the firecracker shell-strewn pavement of Trafalgar Square, I took a good look at the crowd that enveloped me and was surprised by the turnout, a large portion of which was actually Chinese.
Vendors at promotional booths hawking gift bags that included soy sauce, Chinese-inspired aprons and New Year’s-themed DVDs grabbed the attention of potential customers with special deals.
And true to British drinking culture, a public bar selling Tsingtao beer, a specialty from the Shandong province of China, was set up on the side.
More than 250,000 people arrived the Sunday after the first day of the Chinese New Year to welcome the Year of the Tiger and participate in the most important holiday in Chinese culture. Many attendees flaunted their spirits by buying tiger tails, paper dragons and other celebratory trinkets.
The date of Chinese New Year changes annually in accordance with the first day of the lunar calendar. The celebration lasts for 15 days and consists of cultural traditions for each day, including visiting relatives, setting off firecrackers and, of course, eating good food.
When the emcee came on stage to galvanize the crowd into doing the “Chinese wave,” which appeared startlingly similar to “the wave” performed at sports events, she cited her pride in being British-Chinese.
Britain has one of the largest Chinese communities in Europe, with a large portion of that population residing in London.
The effect of that presence is a robust Chinatown that attracts tourists and locals alike with restaurants, markets and other Chinese-run businesses housed in architecturally traditional buildings.
Organized by the London Chinatown Chinese Association, the massive celebration kicked off with a parade through central London and ended in Chinatown, which was decorated with red and gold lanterns and good-fortune posters to mark the occasion.
Dancers wearing colorful dragon-like costumes mimicked a lion’s movements to the beat of drums, cymbals and gongs, as they attempted to ward off bad spirits and spread prosperity by scattering leaves of lettuce.
By mid-afternoon, the narrow streets of Shaftesbury Avenue in Chinatown were packed with people trying to get a peek at the lion dancers as they tried to eat lettuce hung off of fishing poles outside local businesses.
In exchange for this service, businesses also attached red envelopes with money onto the fishing lines to bestow prosperity in more literal terms.
Chinese custom also dictates the offering of red envelopes — called ya sui qian — and is normally given by married adults to younger children “to crush the spirits,” as the translation of the tradition’s name indicates.
Little did I realize that, by the time the lion dance had finished, the crowd had slowly pushed my friends and me in front of a Chinese bakery selling egg tarts. For 2 pounds ($3.05) apiece, we greedily devoured the flaky pastry crust filled with egg custard, which left us only wanting more.
With our hunger sparked, we popped into Fung Shing Restaurant to order a real Chinese meal.
The food available, however, didn’t include the traditional specialties, such as dumplings and nian gao (or New Year’s Cake), eaten during New Year’s celebrations. But, Fung Shing did have an array of family-style dishes in the communal eating style typical of Chinese culture
At about 5:45 p.m., we followed the masses once again toward Leicester Square for the closing ceremony that promised fireworks. After a lengthy speech, the entire square fell silent in anticipation for the first explosion.
Flashes of red and gold glittered the sky in every direction. With the fireworks shot so low into the sky, I could almost touch the tails of light as they rained down dangerously close to the trees. A line of lanterns was lit to look like rockets ready for launch. Firecrackers popped on the ground nearby, matching in loudness the brightness of their more powerful counterparts.
It was as if the world had stopped for 15 minutes as the crowd watched in hushed awe. When the display ended, the crowd disbanded, and I left with my stomach full and Trafalgar and Leicester Squares as empty as they were the night before.

Danica Leigh always wanted to see Pink Floyd’s rock opera The Wall performed live. But because the San Diego native — who spent time in Savannah, Ga.’s theater circuit before landing in Los Angeles last year — missed the 1980 concert tour and 1990s “Live in Berlin” reenactment, she never had the opportunity.

But Leigh, a seasoned puppet and specialty prop crafter, didn’t let that stop her, and what started last December as an idea for a Pink Floyd tribute night quickly evolved into her directing Los Angeles’ largest reenactment of the seminal concept album in 30 years.
With 55 performers — including a full cover band, a choir, a string quartet, a dance troupe and a stilt walker — who all volunteered their time to be a part of Jan. 30’s one-night-only charity event, The Wall: Live in Los Angeles is an ambitious presentation of the timeless work.
“I’m of the mind-set that, if I want to see something live, I might as well do it myself,” Leigh said.
Through 26 psychedelic tracks spread across a double album, The Wall tells the story of Pink, a rock star based on Pink Floyd founding member and lead songwriter Roger Waters, as he struggles with self-imposed isolation created by a metaphorical wall of emotion.
“It’s definitely one of the first border pieces that bridges the gap between rock ‘n’ roll and storytelling in a very direct way,” Leigh said.
The Wall’s strong narrative and sonic theatricality has long inspired grandiose visual adaptations, first as concert spectacle where a physical wall was erected between the band and the audience, then as an eponymous full-length film featuring cartoonist Gerald Scarfe’s elaborate interpretations, but this incarnation started modestly enough.
Inspired by the album’s timeless emotional message and visual imagery that easily lends itself to theater, Leigh contacted fellow Floyd fan Tony Ferrara about helping her find musicians for a pet project she was planning to debut at the Unknown Theater in Hollywood.
“Originally, it was just going to be a lot of guest musicians playing through the various songs off the album,” Ferrara said. “We also wanted to find a way to coordinate a screening of the movie.”

But when Ferrara, a USC alumnus and guitarist for local funk band Big Lovin’ Panda, started to recruit his friends, he found that he and Leigh weren’t the only ones who had been moved by The Wall. He first asked fellow USC alumni Brett Morris and Sean Whalen, both of whom play for local Guns N’ Roses tribute band Chinese Democracy. Instead of agreeing to play one Pink Floyd song as asked, however, they demanded to play the entire album.
“My first thought was, ‘That’s really ambitious,’” Ferrara said. “But Danica is the kind of person who will go as big as possible.”
With several band members in place who already knew the entire album by heart, Leigh and Ferrara knew their pet-project tribute night deserved more than just a film screening. After deciding to make the event a benefit show, listings soon went up on Craigslist for keyboard players, bassists and actors.
The response from the local gig-seeking community was overwhelming.
Session musicians, sound engineers and full-time actors from all over the city replied with stories of deep attachment to the record and claims that they could play The Wall, note-for-note. Despite the lack of monetary compensation for the project, they were all more than willing to give up paying gigs to donate their time, knowledge and instruments to make it happen.
“One of the keyboard players scores films for a living, but when he was 16, he performed The Wall in its entirety with a four-track recorder and a mini Korg in a Chinese restaurant,” Ferrara said. “He’s been waiting for this his whole life.”
Within a week, the cover band of Ferrara’s friends had grown to include eight dedicated musicians — a mix of hobbyists and professionals who, theoretically, could recreate every manual and synthetic nuance of the 80-minute album.
Theory was proved true at the band’s first practice. The motley group of Wall devotees had never played together before, yet without hesitation they blazed through the entire first disc.
“It was remarkable,” Leigh explained. “I said, ‘Looks like I’m going to have to purchase some bricks and make a show.’”
They added a lead singer to play Pink, three professional dancers, a Cirque du Soleil stilt walker, a 16-voice choir and a string quartet whose parts were all arranged within the final week of rehearsals.
“The project outgrew itself very quickly,” Ferrara said.
While Ferrara tried to find a new venue that could fit the now 80-deep production crew (they eventually settled on the Ivy Substation in Culver City), Leigh made “bricks” by filling boxes with Braille manuscripts donated by a local recycling plant and constructed stage ornamentations based on Scarfe’s cartoons.
“From a technical standpoint, part of my initial draw to the project was the strong characters in animation that lend themselves to puppetry,” Leigh said.
But although she had every intention of creating large-scale puppets, the fact that the entire show was planned and executed in under two months put a huge time restriction on realizing her extravagant vision.
And although to the audience of the one-night-only performance it was a perfect multimedia masterpiece, Leigh and Ferrara acknowledge that the album provides material for so much more.
“It ended up being about 30 percent of what we wanted to do,” Ferrara said. “It was painful because the last week we had to assess what we had time for. There is so much more to the story and the show.”
More than any other rock opera of its time — including David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust and The Who’s Tommy and Quadrophenia — Pink Floyd’s The Wall has enjoyed relevance to multiple generations of listeners.
Its heavy themes — which rang true to initial audiences dealing with social and political isolation in a post-Vietnam War landscape — were empowering to those whose lives revolved around the literal wall separating East and West Berlin.
Today, however, Leigh and Ferrara see Pink’s isolation as a story relevant to a more modern problem — Post Traumatic Stress Disorder — and all proceeds from the night’s two performances went directly to the Wounded Warrior Project, a nonprofit that provides counseling for soldiers returning from Afghanistan and Iraq.
“The Wall can easily be seen as a commentary on PTSD and an account of what it does,” Ferrara said. “There’s nothing like coming back to a community that has no idea what you’ve been through.”
Although The Wall: Live in Los Angeles only ran for one night, Leigh and Ferrara have hopes of taking their show to colleges and other venues, spreading the modern interpretation of an album that is both musically and visually powerful.
“It was kind of a pipe dream when we started,” Leigh said. “But when I first heard them play, I knew it had to be done.”

At some point in college, handshaking becomes an almost essential part of making someone’s acquaintance. It starts to feel positively inadequate to just smile and say hello.
The recent frequency and variability of my handshaking encounters has led me to wonder: Why do people shake hands in the first place? Why do some people shake so limply while others try to strangle my hand?
Surely, all of us have been told that a firm handshake makes a positive impression on employers, professors and colleagues. Considering how hard it can be for many of us to get jobs in this economy, it is especially crucial now to be self-conscious about our handshaking styles.
Research psychologist Jesse Bering wrote a column in Scientific American Mind last month about handshaking. Although greeting displays vary wildly from culture to culture, he wrote that aggression and vulnerability are two recurrent features.
The aggressive characteristic is most obvious in the greeting etiquette of Central Eskimo tribes. It entails taking turns slapping each other on the cheek with increasing violence until somebody falls to the ground, Bering explained. This duel allows individuals to prove their worthiness to each other.
The vulnerability attribute, on the other hand, is embodied by the wholeheartedly submissive greeting behavior of some Papuan tribes. “It is customary among some Papuan tribes to touch the tip of the other man’s penis in greeting,” wrote Bering.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
Handshaking seems to fall somewhere between these two extremes, with variations among individuals leaning one way or the other. People who give limp shakes have more of a Papuan style, whereas those who give firm ones are more like the Central Eskimos.
It’s always easier to connect with people whose handshaking styles match one’s own. When people give me limp fingers, I assume they’re timid, disinterested or genuinely breakable creatures — none of which makes it easy to form a connection with them. People who try to strangle my hand to death don’t make a good impression either. It suggests they’re angry, overcompensating or just plain careless.
On the other hand, shaking hands with someone who has a grip that is neither flaccid nor violent feels like making a deal or a promise. It’s like saying, “I’m enthusiastic to meet you; we’re in this together, equally.”
Wikipedia defines a handshake as “a short ritual in which two people grasp each other’s right hand, often accompanied by a brief up and down movement of the grasped hands.”
When you really sit and scrutinize the practice, it seems totally weird and random (though admittedly not as bizarre as other greeting styles).
Handshaking seems to have evolved to communicate something like: “I am touching you without hurting you. You have no reason to fear me presently, but depending on the pressure I am applying to your hand, you can deduce if I am asserting myself or submitting to you.”
Bering cited a University of Alabama study that found that men who shake hands with a strong, long grip with steady eye contact score lower on measures of neuroticism and higher in extroversion and openness than men with flimsy shakes. Women with an assertive handshaking style in the study scored as “more liberal, intellectual and open to new experiences” and were more likable to experimenters.
He also noted women who give firm handshakes were more likely to be offered a job than men who gave equally firm handshakes in a University of Iowa study. This suggests that people are more likely to interpret a firm female handshake as a sign of confidence, whereas a firm male handshake may be more quickly perceived as aggressive or intimidating.
Either way, it is interesting to note what happens when different handshaking styles collide.
Next time you shake hands with somebody, evaluate your style. Are you a Papuan? A Central Eskimo? Can you even tell?
One greeting style that Bering didn’t mention in his column is the cheek kissing of Latin American and some European cultures — a greeting style that communicates not vulnerability or aggression but love.
Maybe we should try this at job interviews.  At least we’d stand out.

I’d rather do the “fist bump” instead of a traditional handshake. Let me enlighten those who are unaware of this urban, ‘hood ritual. You see, culture while incarcerated entails social interaction too, despite the notion that incarcerated individuals are socially dysfunctional. When a bunch of males are incarcerated without any females around…they…you don’t need me to explain explicitly. So, instead of a traditional handshake, a fist bump avoids contact with the palm of another man’s hands, thus germs, potential STD’s and the likes are avoided.
So, here’s a *fist bump* to you ;)
I hate it when you go to shake someone’s hand and they grip too early so that they only get your fingers. Then they follow that with a hard squeeze so that your little finger slides under your ring finger. It’s like: “Nice to meet you. Thanks for the awkward handshake.”

It’s not uncommon for USC students to be pigeonholed by the campus housing properties they live in.
Daily Trojan | William Brown
In the inevitable name-age-major conversation that is the icebreaker at any forced social situation, the major is the first to fall victim to stereotype. Architecture? You must never see the light of day. Business? We’re not talking, we’re networking. Cinema? Go back to your fancy new building to write in your Moleskine.
Although a student’s major might be the first and easiest way to stereotype him, where he lives is just as easy to categorize.
New/North and Birnkrant house the social freshmen, Century and Cardinal, the sophomores unphased by a little bit of grime, and Tuscany, the young, upwardly mobile upperclassmen.
In the end, the only character trait a student’s housing situation reveals is luck — or lack thereof. With another housing lottery finished, a crop of aggrieved students inevitably emerges, with dashed hopes of living in Webb or Troy, or — for the later lottery numbers — anywhere near campus.
USC simply doesn’t have enough beds to accommodate its growing student body. For a university that has only made the shift from commuter to residential in the last decade, administrators are making great strides to  provide housing to more and more students. But the fact remains: Only freshmen and sophomores are guaranteed campus housing.
Though USC has begun to make provisions for the influx of students out on the curb, the university has to offer a housing alternative that caters to all points on the economic spectrum.
The University Gateway Apartments complex, USC’s long-awaited flagship of student housing, is an undeniably important step toward securing more housing options for students. Set to open next year, the towering building on the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa Street will provide 1,650 more beds.
Gateway’s developers, Urban Partners LLC, have gone to many lengths to present the complex as the next frontier in student housing, including elaborate feats of advertising featuring, among other things, miniature ponies on campus. But all the fanfare doesn’t detract from one of Gateway’s largest flaws — the price tag.
With a monthly rent in the neighborhood of roughly $1,064 per person in a double bedroom space, Gateway threatens to be Tuscany 2.0, an apartment complex that caters to a very specific student demographic. Those not able to shell out the cash necessary to secure a spot are left in a precarious position.
USC had the right idea in inviting more student housing close to campus, but now it will have to shoulder the hefty task of providing affordable rent as well. Students shouldn’t have to be forced to choose between soaring costs and living outside the wobbly boundaries of Campus Cruiser.
USC’s residential students contribute to a thriving and dynamic campus experience — one the university is sure to tout to potential students, along with the football team’s myriad accomplishments and Tommy Trojan’s physique. But if students are left with no other option than to commute, the campus dynamic is at risk.
So apart from all the bells and whistles (and ponies), the university still has a job to do. We can only hope administrators accept the responsibility of continuing to provide appropriate housing for its students.

No. 3 California triumphed over the No. 10 USC women’s tennis team Friday afternoon with a 5-2 victory, spoiling the Women of Troy’s perfect record on their home courts at Marks Stadium.
For the first seeded double’s match, the Bears’ No. 13 duo of Mari Andersson and Jana Juricova put away USC’s juniors Lyndsay Kinstler and Maria Sanchez with a quick 8-1 victory.
Even though Cal (8-1) eventually secured the double point, the second and third seeded doubles matches were hard-fought battles. At the second court, USC’s freshman Danielle Lao and sophomore Alison Ramos fought back from trailing 0-6 in the match to pound out a 9-7 upset over Cal’s No. 54 Marina Cossou and Kasia Siwosz.
On the third court, USC’s duo of freshman Valeria Pulido and senior Sarah Fansler fought in a close match that ended in a tiebreaker in Cal’s favor 11-9.
The Bears then went on to secure the match fairly easily with three straight-set singles victories. Cal won the first singles match on the second court as No. 20 Cossou won a 6-2, 6-2 match over No. 19 Ramos. Then, the Bears went up 3-0 as Cal’s Nelly Radeva put away Kinstler, 6-4, 6-4, at the No. 6 position. Soon thereafter, Cal secured the victory with Tayler Davis’ win over USC’s junior Cristala Andrews at fifth singles.
With the outcome decided, three matches were still going and extending into third sets.
At the fourth court, USC’s No. 51 Pulido lost the first set but came back to force the match into a third set against Cal’s Kasia Siwosz. Pulido took an early lead in the third, and Siwosz retired from the match (4-6, 6-3, 2-0) giving the Women of Troy (7-3) its first point of the day.
The highlight of the day for USC was a clash between the nation’s best that featured No. 3 Sanchez and Cal’s No. 2 Jana Juricova. Sanchez took the first set rather quickly, but Juricova answered right back by winning the next set.
In the third set, Sanchez took a 2-0 lead but Juricova responded by tying it 2-2. Sanchez came back by winning the next three games, breaking Juricova twice making the score 5-2. Juricova immediately broke Sanchez back, but it was Sanchez who triumphed in the end, claiming a dominant 6-1, 2-6, 6-3 victory at the No. 1 slot.
With the match score at 4-2, another hard-fought duel continued at the third position between No. 31 Lao and No. 75 Andersson. Andersson took the first set, 6-1, over Lao, but Lao countered by winning the second set 6-2. Lao was up 4-3 in the third set, but was unable to close the match. Andersson made a push and came out on top with a 7-5 win to make the final score, 5-2, for Cal.
USC’s match against Stanford was canceled due to rain on Saturday and will not be rescheduled. Instead, the Women of Troy and the Cardinals will next face off in Palo Alto, Calif., in their Pac-10 match on April 2.

The No. 5 USC women’s golf team looks to recover from its worst outing in four months this week at the Bruin Wave Invitational at the Robinson Ranch Golf Club in Santa Clarita, Calif.
Last week, at the Wildcat Invitational in Tucson, Ariz., the Women of Troy finished in 12th place, and they are looking to put that poor performance behind them.
“It’s not a good thing that happened, but it’s better to happen earlier in the season” said junior Lizette Salas.  “We’re looking to start fresh.”
The whole team could use that fresh start, including sophomore Jennifer Song, the No. 1 collegiate golfer in the country.
Song enters this week coming off her worst finish of the season, a tie for 22nd, which included the worst round of her USC career, an 80.  It was the first time Song had finished in the 80’s as a Trojan, and the All-American looks to regain her momentum this week.
Senior Belen Mozo, going for her fourth All-American award this season, was the strongest of the Women of Troy last week, tying for 12th place overall.
Mozo appears to have completely recovered from the shoulder injury she sustained at the end of her junior season, and is ready to resume her place at the top of the leader board every week.  With one more round below 70,
Mozo will set a USC record for career sub-70 rounds, currently held by Mozo, Song, and former Trojan Irene Cho.
Salas, a two time All-American, is also recovering from her worst outing of the season, a tie for 53rd.  She feels prepared to bounce back this week.  “We worked really hard in the weight room and at practice, and we feel ready for real golf instead of cart golf” she said, noting that the golfers were allowed to use carts in Tucson.
Also heading to Santa Clarita are sophomore Inah Park and freshman Cyna Rodriguez.  Park’s tie for 57th last week was her season worst, just as Rodriguez had a season low with her tie for 84th.
The Women of Troy have their work cut out for them this week, as they enter the Invitational with no positive momentum.  They face tough competition that includes No. 1 Arizona State, who took home the title in Tucson, and No. 2 UCLA. Despite the short turnaround, the team feels confident heading into the first round.
“We’re definitely ready and we feel right,” Salas said.
The tournament runs Monday through Wednesday.

A former USC defensive star is back with the Trojan football team.
Sammy Knight, who played at USC until 1997, has been hired by football coach Lane Kiffin to serve as a graduate assistant. He will work with the secondary.
During his time at USC, Knight lettered all four years and recorded five interceptions and 290 tackles. He became a linebacker senior year after starting as a safety during both his sophomore and junior seasons.
In his senior year alone, he had 121 tackles, more than anyone else on the team. That year, he also received All-Pac 10 honors and was the team’s MVP and co-captain.
Knight was not known for having great speed, however, his ability to take correct angles and learn his positions well gave him the edge he needed to succeed.
He did not get drafted after leaving USC in 1997. Nonetheless, he went on to play 12 seasons in the NFL, playing for teams including the New Orleans Saints, Miami Dolphins, Kansas City Chiefs, New York Giants and Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2002, he made the Pro Bowl as a member of the Saints.
Knight is replacing Kris Richard, another former Trojan football player. Richard is taking an assistant job with the Seattle Seahawks, the team that former football coach Pete Carroll is now coaching.
Knight is not the only member of his family with ties to the Trojan football team. His brothers Ryan and Darryl played on the team as a tailback from 1983 to 1986 and a linebacker 1998 to 2000, respectively.
