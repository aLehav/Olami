    
Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Annette Gordon-Reed spoke about the Supreme Court case Dred Scott v. Sanford and the challenges of United States citizenship at Doheny Library Thursday for a discussion titled, “Was Justice Taney Right? Fighting for Citizenship in the United States.” 
The event, hosted by the Dornsife Center for Law, History and Culture, was moderated by Gould School of Law professor Ariela Gross and drew an audience of approximately 100 students, faculty and guests.
Gordon-Reed evaluated the 1857 Supreme Court decision that said African Americans were not citizens. At the time, Roger B. Taney was the Chief Justice and wrote the 7-2 decision. 
Gordon-Reed, a professor at Harvard Law School, spoke as a part of the Dornsife Law and Humanities Distinguished Lecturer Series, a yearly program that invites law and history professors from other prestigious universities to speak on humanitarian issues.  
Gould School of Law vice dean for academic affairs Alex Capron introduced Gordon-Reed at the beginning of the event. 
“Looking at legal issues through the lens of history, philosophy and literature adds so much,” Capron said in his introduction.
Gordon-Reed said Justice Taney’s controversial remarks reflected America’s mindset in the 1850s. 
“He’s telling the truth … it’s not a truth we want to hear,” Gordon-Reed said. “We want to assume people had better thoughts. We like to think he was just a prejudiced man and that these things don’t have resonance, but they do have resonance.” 
Gross agreed with her sentiments.
“I think the takeaway was a really shocking one,” Gross said. “Although Justice Taney might be wrong about the history, and maybe he wasn’t right about the law, he was right about the attitudes towards African Americans in the time he wrote.” 
Gordon-Reed also spoke about her personal experiences facing discrimination in the United States.  
“I looked at the movie theater that was [in my hometown] that my brothers and I used to go to, and I sat in the balcony.” Gordon-Reed said. “It was where black people had to sit. Now, the law had just changed. The law said they couldn’t make us sit there, but the culture had not gotten to the point yet that they would allow that. If we had tried to sit any place else, there would have been a problem.”
Gordon-Reed said it is important to analyze the Constitution to contextualize the history of citizenship, race and discrimination in the United States. 
“I think it took the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendment to get rid of slavery,” Gordon-Reed said. “And there are provisions in the Constitution that we all know that support slavery, and there are things less obvious that support the institution of slavery.” 
Gordon-Reed said she became fascinated with history and law due to her upbringing in Texas.  
“I knew that was a slave state, so the institution of slavery naturally interested me,” Gordon-Reed told the Daily Trojan. “There were people and my ancestors who were enslaved in Texas.”
Gordon-Reed ended her speech with a call to action — she encouraged members of the audience to engage in the democratic process. 
“Pay attention to government. Pay attention. Participate in government,” she emphasized. “Vote. Volunteer. You’re a part of a democracy, and it doesn’t work if the people don’t make their feelings known and if they don’t participate in it.”

The University faces an uphill battle in repairing its reputation, which has been marred by allegations and lawsuits surrounding incidents of sexual harassment and assault, and is looking to restore students’ trust in the institution. During a time fraught with unease on campus, it is vital for the University to demonstrate its commitment to swift action against sexual misconduct. Reassessing the school’s partnerships with entities associated with sexual harassment and assault is an important first step. 
One such institution is the Terranea Resort. In 2012, USC announced the hotel was the official resort for USC Athletics. Since 2017, eight current and former employees have come forward with  allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment against the resort. For almost two years, USC has had the opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to upholding the safety of its students by taking a stand against sexual assault. However, even amid the controversy surrounding the resort, USC has continued to maintain a partnership and continues to hold events at the resort. 
UNITE HERE Local 11, a Southern California workers union, recently began, urging USC and other Terranea partners to cut ties with the resort through its #MeTooTerranea boycott. Joining this union and severing ties with the resort is an opportunity for USC to uphold its core values of integrity and wellness. In order to fulfill its obligation to creating a safe environment for students, the University must hold itself and its partners to high standards of conduct and refuse to tolerate instances of alleged sexual harassment or assault.
The Daily Trojan previously reported that USC Athletics is aware of the allegations against the Terranea Resort. 
“[We] will continue to monitor [the resort] closely,” USC Athletics wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We have a zero tolerance policy for that kind of behavior on our campuses and require the same commitment from our partners.”
If USC truly upholds a zero tolerance policy, the administration must enforce it by terminating its relationship with the Terranea Resort. Preserving this partnership not only presents an indifference toward this issue but also risks the safety of students and staff who attend USC-affiliated events hosted at Terranea.
Admittedly, ending a six-year partnership is neither simple nor straightforward, and USC may lose any privileges it enjoyed through the partnership. Regardless, the University’s first priority should be to protect its students and not its business alliances. Continuing to associate with the resort even after these allegations have surfaced suggests that USC is complacent in preserving a culture that enables sexual harassment and fails to validate survivors’ experiences. 
USC would not be the first to distance itself from the resort. Last year, AOL and Oath relocated their MAKERS Conference, which was held at the Terranea Resort for years, an action that did not result in significant backlash. In fact, AOL’s action was referenced in a letter sent to Vox from the Tech Workers Coalition regarding their Recode Conference, another event Terranea is slated to host, urging Vox to follow AOL’s example and change its venue.
Last November, Beyoncé cut ties with Topshop after its co-founder, Sir Philip Green, was accused of sexual harassment. Netflix canceled projects with disgraced comedian Louis C.K. and actor Kevin Spacey following allegations against the actors. Multiple universities have rescinded honorary degrees from prominent alumni facing credible allegations of predatory behavior. As major institutions in all industries rise to condemn sexual assault and harassment, USC must do the same, both with its partners and within the University. 
Cutting ties with the Terranea Resort would be a step in the right direction for the University and would send a strong message of solidarity to victims of alleged sexual harassment and assault. At a time when students’ trust in the University is waning, taking action would affirm the University stands with its students, before its business interests.

Nearly 50 students, faculty and alumni marched from Tommy Trojan to the Engemann Student Health Center in the rain Wednesday to protest USC’s handling of sexual misconduct cases. The protest was partially prompted by new allegations made last week against former campus physician Dennis Kelly, who resigned last August. 
Students organizing the protest said they felt the need to act after hearing the most recent allegations, which followed allegations of sexual misconduct against former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, who has been accused of harassment and abuse by over 500 women.
“I was disappointed by the lack of outrage on campus, but I realized that it wasn’t that students weren’t upset, it was that they didn’t have a place to be upset and to voice those concerns,” said Katie Thanos, a junior majoring in law, history and culture. “I feel like we needed to make a space for that, and that’s what today is.” 
Since six LGBTQ former students filed a lawsuit last Monday against the University and Kelly for gender violence and sexual harassment, the University has yet to release an official public statement. Many of the protestors cited this in their reasons for marching. 
Katie Hurley, a second-year graduate student studying social work, was one of the students who spoke to the crowd gathered at Hahn Plaza. 
“It has become painfully clear that our Student Health Center is [an environment] where abusers thrive,” Hurley said. “[Chief Health Officer] Sarah Van Orman has made some really important changes … except it’s still putting the responsibility on students … what really needs to change is the environment.” 
After hearing from various student representatives, the protestors marched to Engemann to deliver a list of demands, specifically to Van Orman, who did not come out to greet the demonstrators. The organizers demanded sensitivity training for all USC Student Health workers, dismissal of employees complicit in past sexual abuse and increased transparency from the University, among other requests.
The protest was organized by a number of campus organizations, including the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, which released its own statement last week. 
“We want members of QuASA and students at large to know that we condemn these alleged actions in the strongest possible terms,” the statement read. “We are committed to pushing USC to make the safety of its students, particularly its marginalized students, [the] top priority.” 
Justice for Trojans, a group formed by alumna Ariel Sobel last year in response to the allegations made against Tyndall, also helped organize the protest.  
Sobel, a 2017 graduate who organized a protest against University administration last June, said she was proud of how Wednesday’s protest turned out. 
“It’s really amazing to see current students fighting for justice of people that they don’t know,” Sobel said. “It shows a real moral compass.” 
Sobel said she and her fellow organizers tried to make the list of demands representative of the student body’s needs. The organizers plan to incorporate the list into a petition for students, faculty and staff to sign. 
“We tried to make it very inclusive,” Sobel said. “We had queer people, survivors … I’m really quite proud of how extensive [the demands] are.” 
In the list of demands to the health center, protesters said the University must allocate more funding to the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services program to make more resources available to students, faculty and staff. 
RSVP director Brenda Ingram said that while the office has been underfunded in the past, since she started her position in July, the University has provided the office with more resources. RSVP has hired a violence prevention specialist and will look to hire advocates to support students. 
According to Ingram, the office will host its first round of bystander intervention training Saturday, an event that will soon become a requirement for all campus organization leadership. The office also plans to have mandatory affirmative consent training for incoming students beginning in Fall 2019.
“Crisis is about danger and opportunity,” Ingram said. “There’s been some dangerous things going on and that opens the door to make some huge cultural shifts here at USC. I’m optimistic and hopeful that this is going to continue to give more resources to RSVP, and I’m seeing that happen.” 
Undergraduate Student Government Sen. Michaela Murphy also spoke at the rally and apologized for USG’s silence regarding the recent allegations against Kelly and previous campus scandals. Murphy said she has pushed for USG officials to make statements on controversial issues on campus as a show of support for those affected, but she said the attempts were rejected.
“Even just a statement, a show of clear and strong support to the communities who are affected, is better than nothing at all,” Murphy said. “The fact that people had to essentially organize outside of student government to have a protest today is really shameful because if ever there were a time for student government leaders to step up and support students it’s today.” 
In a statement obtained by the Daily Trojan, Van Orman said USC Student Health is committed to providing a “positive, enriching environment” for students on campus. 
“USC supports and values all its members, including our LGBTQ+ community,” Van Orman wrote. “We take any student health care complaint seriously, and we are here to provide resources to support anyone who may need them.” 
Joy Shin, a member of the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, said she encouraged APASA members to attend the rally in support of victims of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall’s alleged sexual harassment. Many of the complaints against Tyndall say he targeted various minority groups in his treatments, including Asian students. 
“I advocated for the Asian American community to stand in solidarity with all survivors, especially considering Dr. Tyndall specifically targeted a lot of people from our community,” Shin said. “I felt like I needed to show my support in some way and show the administration that there are students here who will rally on behalf of survivors.”

Viterbi School of Engineering professors Mahta Moghaddam and Berok Khoshnevis were elected to the National Academy of Engineering, a nonprofit institution dedicated to promoting leaders in engineering and fostering an innovative environment Feb. 7.
“Election to the National Academy of Engineering is the highest achievement and recognition for an engineer,” Viterbi Dean Yannis Yortsos said.
Moghaddam serves as the director of new research initiatives within Viterbi and is involved with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Antennas and Propagation Society, an international organization that specializes in the interaction between waves and their terrestrial surroundings.
Moghaddam’s research includes using remote sensors to find patterns in weather and hydrologic cycles to demonstrate how water resources are becoming depleted in the world. As a microwave engineer, she focuses on designing, building, transmitting and repairing electronics that transmit small electromagnetic waves, or microwaves. 
Her work as the director of the Microwave Systems, Sensors and Imaging Lab led to innovative approaches to environmental mapping and breast cancer treatment.
Khoshnevis is among one of the key developers of 3-D printing, particularly for large-scale structures and buildings. 
“In general, my interest has been on invention, technology and development,” Khoshnevis said. “I have inventions in many different fields including fabrication, energy, wind, biomedical and dentistry.” 
Khoshnevis holds over 100 patents related to 3-D printing. In 2017, Khoshnevis founded the Contour Crafting Corporation,  which aims to apply 3-D printing to the construction industry.
“Khoshnevis is essentially one of the key people who developed 3-D printing,” Yortsos said. 
Only 12 other Viterbi faculty members have been elected to NAE since 2008, according to Viterbi. 
Khoshnevis said he was humbled by the distinction and grateful to be inducted into the prestigious collective of intellectuals. 
“Having been selected by a group of accomplished engineers to become a member of NAE is an endorsement for me that I am a good engineer,” Khoshnevis said. 
Moghaddam said she was honored by her election to the academy and aims to continue her engineering endeavors.
“I hope to be able to do my part to inspire and support and to do all I can to live up to … the expectations of this wonderful institution that is USC, and of course, USC Viterbi,” Moghaddam told USC News. 
The NAE induction ceremony will take place Oct. 6 in Washington, D.C.

Kennedy Reese believes in living with intention. She found her passion for public policy through a gender minorities health disparity class for her previous undergraduate major, biochemistry. Deciding she wanted to get involved in the legislative decisions affecting different communities, Reese, now a graduate student, switched her major to public policy to learn how to create the changes she wanted to see. 
“What inspired me from the beginning … was that I realized the black community was really vulnerable to a lot of these legislative changes and has been historically and that a lot of these policies or predicted outcomes right now are a direct result of the policies that were instilled before,” Reese said. “If I’m going to have any sustainable impact on my community for the better, it’ll have to be through legislation.” 
Reese, who also received her undergraduate degree from USC, has worked on instigating and promoting change on and off campus throughout her five years at USC. 
She currently works as a fellowship coordinator for the Public Rights Project, a nonprofit that works to protect Americans’ rights by providing support to state and local law offices. Reese runs the program’s fellowship programming, which helps attorneys transition to the public works sector. 
“A lot of local offices are underfunded and understaffed, so basically Public Rights Project is trying to bridge the gap,” Reese said. “If it’s a staff issue, OK, well, let’s help you get staff; if it’s any pro bono work we can do to alleviate the pressure, OK, we can do that.”
In her time at USC, Reese has held various roles in California politics, including an internship with California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 2018 gubernatorial campaign, the Los Angeles Attorney’s Office and Sen. Kamala Harris’ 2016 U.S. Senate campaign and a fellowship with the office of Assemblymember Reginald Jones-Sawyer Sr. 
On campus, Reese has worked as a Social Justice Specialist — she led a series of Real Talk discussions for the Center for Black Cultural and Students Affairs at USC, which cover social and campus climate issues. As a leader for Real Talk from August 2017 to December 2018, Reese said she facilitated conversations about relevant issues, brought in elected officials to participate in Real Talk sessions and created field opportunities for participants to foster change through activities like neighborhood canvassing. 
“I also have a passion for political engagement and engaging young people to care about politics,” Reese said. “At our CBCSA, I created programming targeted at our student population to get people involved in activities. I brought elected officials from all different levels of government, consultants [and] nonprofits, and they either spoke, or we did some kind of speaking engagement for the students coupled with some kind of field opportunity to either work with that nonprofit or go canvas a neighborhood.”
Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs Director Rosalind Conerly said Reese is a dedicated leader who always made and progressed new ideas for Real Talk events.
“Once we said, ‘Hey, you’re the lead on Real Talk,’ she kind of took that and ran with it and really made it her own … She was able to identify speakers to bring in on her own, that was all her connections,” Conerly said. “I would say she’s someone that’s very resourceful, very organized.”
But Reese’s dedication to sharing her passion extends beyond the workplace, according to Conerly, who said Reese brought in several copies of former First Lady Michelle Obama’s “Becoming” to share with her peers.
“There’s a GroupMe that she’s in, and she’s like, ‘Hey I bought all these books, if anyone wants one stop by CBCSA, you can have it,’” Conerly said. “It’s certain things she’s doing because she just wants to share with her peers.”
There are certain difficulties in public policy, according to Reese, that made her realize self-care is essential for taking care of herself and her communities. 
“There’s a general apathy about politics that I feel like is difficult to tap into … I think there’s basic things we can all agree on,” Reese said. “But translating that into getting people to the polls or to the ballot box — it’s just not the same.”
But Reese’s passion has carried her through the tough patches, inspiring her to stay involved and stay active in creating change.
“I have to realize, ‘OK, I did my part.’ I can’t control everything. I can’t follow everything,” Reese said. “It’s learning when and how to take breaks before I’m beginning to internalize all the world issues.”
Despite the challenges, Reese said her dedication to public policy refuses to wane.
“I have to be at a table where decisions are made,” Reese said. “Because if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.”
This story is part of  the Daily Trojan’s special coverage for Black History Month. It will run periodically throughout February.

On holidays, it made tamales by the hundreds in a packed kitchen and, during the summer, ate fruit covered in Chamoy and Tajín. Los Angeles is, despite all the modern anti-immigrant rhetoric in America, a child of Mexico. Every other street corner sells tacos, frutas and hot dogs; the best burritos are cradled in plastic baskets and served inside of tiny shacks. While Los Angeles is a melting pot of many cultures, the Latinx influence is impossible to ignore — its name, ​Los Angeles, ​even bleeds green, red and white. It is one of the most unique places in the country both because of its strong Mexican influence and undeniable metropolitan growth.
​In the age where ​“Chef’s Table” ​amasses millions of viewers and Instagram food pages reel in millions of followers, the culinary world has never garnered as much interest and exposure as it does now. More and more middle-class individuals are willing to spend $400 on a prix fixe meal at Los Angeles meccas like Providence and Vespertine. Ingredients, culture and storytelling have never been as closely interconnected as they are right now on menus throughout Los Angeles. However, there is an element of the culture that is lacking: a part of L.A. so essential, yet so barren in the culinary world. If the people of Los Angeles are so willing to explore the food world around them, why has the country closest to us been so ignored in the rise of high-quality, culturally-based restaurants?
Generally, the average price of a meal depends on the type of cuisine. And for cuisines belonging to cultures the United States implicitly opposes, these prices are significantly lowered. Between the stratification of immigrants in lower-income areas forced to create cheaper food for the community, or the American expectation that “a good taco should never be over $2,” the food of most ethnic minorities in the U.S. is significantly less expensive than French, Italian or Japanese food. This is certainly true in L.A., where dollar tacos are abundant (and delicious). And while there’s nothing wrong with dollar tacos, the idea that “ethnic” food should be cheap is partially informed by an American bias — one that says some countries are simply not worth as much as others.
Los Angeles is positioned at a particularly unique intersection of Mexican food privilege: most of the fresh goods used in Mexican cuisine are available in bulk, and the strong Mexican presence in the city welcomes all varieties of food. The streets of Los Angeles smell of mole from Oaxaca, fried shrimp from Jalisco and roasted pork from the Yucatán. Bakeries overflow with pan dulce, and chile-coated tamarind sneaks its way into chain supermarkets. There is an abundance of Mexico in the sprawling areas of Los Angeles.
Wes Avila of Guerrilla Tacos, Carlos Salgado from Taco Maria, Eduardo Ruiz from Corazon y Miel and Ray Garcia from Broken Spanish all know about this abundance of culture in Los Angeles. They’ve lived in it for most of their lives. Using masterful techniques and high-quality ingredients, these chefs are combining the city of Los Angeles and the country of Mexico into a new genre of Mexican food: They’ve created Alta California cuisine.
 By introducing gourmet, Mexican-inspired dishes, these chefs are combating (intentionally or unintentionally) our expectations of Mexican cuisine by creating food made by the immigrant experience, but still served on a fine dining level. Those who experience Mexican food in this way will begin to form new associations with the country, replacing images of cheap tacos with delicately fried chicharron and squid ink tortillas. For many, dining at an Alta California restaurant doesn’t feel like eating at a taco stand — because it’s not. It is redefining the expectations of Mexican food, forming new classics from expertly crafted traditions. 
Alta California cuisine is for individuals who might scoff at a taco stand but will pay $200 for a dinner at Broken Spanish. It is for the foodies that will drive 10 miles in L.A. traffic to purchase a single taco adorned with sea urchin. It is for the people who have seen Mexican culture through a lens muddled by political propaganda and freezer section burritos. It is for the people who have a superficial understanding of Mexico but have never understood its culture. It is for the people who are willing to experience something new, something connected to history, something connected to another human being. Alta California strips away the platitudes of Mexican food and serves it instead as a person cooking their passions for another person — a fundamental and universal gesture of community. 
In a world of nacho cheese-flavored taco shells and Cheeto-crusted everything, it is important to recall the merits and power of quality Mexican cuisine. Mexican culture is inextricably intertwined with Los Angeles; the city was nurtured into maturity in the shadow of Mexico. For too long, El Ranchito was the only exposure to Mexican cuisine, serving up massive platters of comforting classics like enchiladas, tacos and burritos. For too long, Taco Bell has stood in the limelight with their Mexican-inspired menu, a monolithic representation of a country with dozens of states and hundreds of unique subcultures. For too long, the street taco has been the closest dish to authentic Mexican food in Los Angeles and the rest of the nation. This city has the power to change all that.

Promising professions of love, daring outlaw and moral ambiguities topped off with an unforgettable ending realized by director Drew Barr, School of Dramatic Arts students  will perform William Shakespeare’s comedy “The Two Gentlemen of Verona” Thursday at Bing Theatre.  
“The Two Gentlemen of Verona” opens with a problem: young Proteus must venture to Milan with his best friend Valentine and leave the professed love of his life, Julia, at home to become a man in his own right. While in Milan, however, both men fall for the damsel Silvia, and Proteus plots to have Valentine banished so he can have Silvia all to himself. What Proteus does not know is that Julia followed him to Milan dressed as his manservant, calling herself Sebastian. The plot only continues to thicken as Valentine returns with his band of outlaws to seek retribution.
In preparation for the play, members of the Master in Fine Arts Acting Program worked 48 hours every week throughout the month of February. The student actors aim to move audiences through their interpretation of the “elevated” world Shakespeare brings to the stage, said MFA acting student Atiya Walcott, who plays Julia.
Walcott explained the importance of creating a believable environment for Shakespeare’s fanciful tale.
“In Shakespeare’s world, his plays are about forgiving the unforgivable,” Walcott said. “Shakespeare’s play takes place in a heightened state … It’s not a world in which we can readily be placed.” 
The viewer, although removed from the throes of Elizabethan England, is submerged in the play’s themes of human nature and reconciliation, Walcott said.
“You want to see people forgive the unforgivable on stage because people don’t do that,” Walcott said. “It’s way harder to forgive your best friend … than to hate your best friend for the rest of your life.” 
While Walcott does not promise the cast of “The Two Gentlemen of Verona” will succeed in moving the audience in this way, she trusts in the effort of the Dramatic Arts program actors and the language of Shakespeare itself.
“When [a play] is done well, it makes you feel something that you don’t feel normally,” Walcott said. “You will be moved in a very real way, if it is done well, which is very hard to do.” 
About 30 individuals work on the set, which itself is unconventional in structure and flexibility. There are 15 characters, but only nine people act in the show. Barr’s version of this tale has permission to bend the rules because of the topsy-turvy world Shakespeare wrote into existence, according to Walcott. 
“There’s a duke that’s played by a woman. There’s a damsel in distress that’s played by a man,” Walcott said. 
Gender-bending in the play not only allows the cast to fill a variety of diverse roles, but it also emphasizes the comic effect of Julia’s transformation and echoes the Shakespearean practice of substituting males in female positions when women were not allowed to step onstage. 
Walcott said the majority of the cast is comprises people of color, another important factor in their take on Shakespeare. 
“Seven out of nine of us are black,” Walcott said. “I’m very moved that we have this largely black ensemble during Black History Month, [especially] doing William Shakespeare, which is a very European-centric based play.”
The play also benefits from Drew Barr’s direction. Barr is a guest director at USC who led SDA’s production of “The Matchmaker” in February 2018. He has also helped direct Broadway productions of “War Horse,” “All My Sons” and “Twelfth Night.”  
Barr’s production of Shakespeare’s “The Two Gentlemen of Verona” will run from Feb. 21 to 24.

For four days last week, artists and art lovers alike flocked to Paramount Studios to attend the first edition of Frieze Los Angeles from Feb. 15 to 17. Frieze is a contemporary art fair with shows in London, New York and, now, Los Angeles. Though L.A. has a thriving modern art scene, the city has lacked an international fair where galleries from around the world could sell to West Coast-based collectors.
Inside a large white tent on Paramount’s lot, 70 galleries from across the world displayed art in hopes of making sales. From large international galleries like Hauser & Wirth, to smaller L.A.-based galleries like The Pit, there was a diverse lineup of dealers and artists represented at the fair. 
Though the event lacked a specific theme, many galleries devoted their booths to West Coast artists. Gagosian Gallery featured selected works from artists like Ed Ruscha and Jennifer Guidi, both of whom live and work in Los Angeles, while New York-based Acquavella Gallery dedicated its entire booth to California painter Wayne Thiebaud. The choice to exhibit so many California painters may have been an attempt to show fair visitors works they’d resonate with, inspiring local first-time collectors to make a purchase.
Still, some of the most intriguing booths at the fair exhibited artists with which first-time fair visitors may be unfamiliar. Gallery Hyundai, a Seoul-based gallery, showcased a diverse array of contemporary South Korean artists, including Minjung Kim, who creates works on mulberry paper, and Yeesookyung, a visual artist who creates sculptures out of broken pottery fragments. 
Another standout was Commonwealth and Council, a smaller Los Angeles gallery that dedicated their booth to artists Rafa Esparza and Beatriz Cortez. The duo created an installation that combined manmade objects, like backpacks and discarded industrial materials, with dirt and cacti. The piece merged traditional Aztec beliefs with contemporary objects and featured a representation of the Aztec god Xolotl made out of adobe and placed in a steel object the artists referred to as a spaceship. Xolotl, the traditional protector of individuals who are considered ‘outsiders’ was protected by the contemporary.
In the back of the Paramount lot, art installations merged with film at Frieze Projects, which had site-specific installations. Curated by Ali Subotnick, Frieze Projects took place in Paramount’s five-acre reconstruction of New York City. Art, pop-up shops and restaurants overtook the fake city, and it featured works from artists like Barbara Kruger and Paul McCarthy. 
While there was plenty to do, the focus of Frieze Projects seemed to lean toward the commercial spaces instead of the art itself. There was little separation between the stores and art installations, and the art was sometimes presented as features of the movie scenery. The installed works didn’t have descriptive text next to them, and their signs only told viewers the title of the work and the artist’s name. 
However, Frieze Projects did have some standout installations. Tino Sehgal’s “This is Competition” was a performance piece featuring gallerists who represented the artist. The two gallerists explained Sehgal’s works to an audience but were only allowed to say one word at a time. This created an interesting dynamic between the two performers, as they alternated words and tried to form coherent sentences, which was an occasional success. 
Trulee Hall’s “Infestation” consisted of green papier-mâché tentacles which snaked in and traced around a fake building, with an accompanying video installation inside the building. The papier-mâché tentacles seemed to draw inspiration from old science fiction movies and was a perfect addition to the Paramount backlot. 
The fair also featured a selection of talks and film screenings, which took place in theaters across Paramount Studios. The talks mostly featured prominent members of the Los Angeles art scene, while the films they showed were created by artists from all over the world. The film programming served as more of an accompaniment to the gallery and projects section, and the close proximity of all three made it easy to indulge all of the fair’s components. 
The fair was first and foremost an attempt to test the waters of Los Angeles’ art market and to see if there was any interest for an art fair in L.A. To its success, celebrities like Brad Pitt, Lana Del Rey and Kanye West attended the fair and tickets for the gallery section were sold out over a week before the fair’s opening. 
By the end of Frieze LA’s final day, it seemed almost guaranteed that the inaugural fair would return for a 2020 edition.

The No. 1 USC women’s water polo team is on the road at Irvine to compete in four matches at the Barbara Kalbus Invitational this week.
Last weekend, the Trojans  opened Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference play with a 19-1 win over the Indiana Hoosiers at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. 
This weekend, USC is one of 16 teams competing in the tournament. The Trojans will be playing in Group A, along with Arizona State, UC Santa Barbara and San Diego State. 
Junior utility Maud Megens and sophomore driver Paige Hauschild lead the Trojans in scoring with 33 and 21 goals, respectively. Senior goalie Amanda Longan leads the conference in saves with 99 in the books this season.
Hauschild said playing in four games over the course of the weekend is no hard task for the Trojans.
“We’ve played this tournament before, we played in the Santa Barbara tournament as well, where we had four games, so it is something we’re used to,” Hauschild said. “But especially with some big competition this weekend, we’re doing a lot of preparation, a lot of video, and our practices are really geared toward our opponents, so we’re just doing everything we can to prepare for some of the top teams.”
The action begins Friday morning at 10 a.m. with a match against SDSU. Senior driver Hannah Carillo and sophomore utility Emily Bennett lead the Aztecs offensively this season with 11 and 7 goals, respectively, along with eight and five assists, respectively. Senior goalie Maura Cantoni will defend the cage and has 57 saves on the season.
If USC wins its match Saturday morning, it will move on to the tournament semi-finals on Saturday afternoon. The Trojans would continue the weekend’s action by facing off against the winner of the ASU vs. UCSB match.
Junior defender Bente Rogge and senior attacker Maud Koopman are scoring powerhouses for the Sun Devils, posting 27 and 25 goals this season respectively. Sophomore goalie Bridget Johnston anchors the defense in goal with 24 saves.
For UCSB, junior utility Sarah Snyder and freshman attacker Amanda Legaspi lead the Gauchos’ scoring with 27 and 23 goals  this season respectively. Freshman utility Caitlyn Snyder aids with 10 assists. Junior goalie Kenzi Snyder holds down the defense with 64 saves in goal.
Hauschild said USC still has growing to do before it can play its best.
“Obviously, we’ve had a lot of success so far, but I think our team chemistry in the pool can improve,” she said. “We just need to play more games together, we had a few girls come in January, so mixing them into the team is still a work in progress. Outside the water, we love them. They’re great girls, but figuring out our roles in the pool is still a big thing.”
If the Trojans secure a victory Saturday afternoon, they will advance to the championship game on Sunday. All games will take place at the UC Irvine Aquatic Center and the Corona del Mar pool. 
Hauschild said it’s important for the team to keep its goal of another national championship in mind as it continues the season.
“We all know what our end goal is, we went over our goals at the beginning of the season,” Hauschild said. “None of us are really satisfied. We’re all still looking forward. We’re not complacent at all. Our coach keeps us in check, and we all keep each other in check, so we’re just continuing the hard work.”

The Trojans are heading to San Diego State this weekend to face the Aztecs on Friday. Following the match, USC will return home Sunday to compete against Jacksonville University. The weekend’s back-to-back matches follow the Trojans’ fourth consecutive winning season-opener with a victory over Hofstra University last weekend. Following this triumph, USC ranks No. 21 in the country. The Trojans are hopeful that they can continue their winning streak against the Aztecs this weekend. USC faced San Diego State once last year, emerging with a 17-7 victory in a late-season matchup at McAlister Field. Attacker Izzy McMahon, then a sophomore, scored an impressive 4 goals and added an assist for good measure. Fellow junior attacker Hope Anhut also contributed 3 goals in the comfortable win. However, it is unclear if the defense can replicate the strong effort of holding SDSU to 7 goals. Departed goalie Gussie Johns led the defense that day, and was replaced by sophomore Riley Hertford.The last time USC competed against Jacksonville was during the 2017 season. USC won the match 13-10 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.The Trojans are looking for another successful season, which means every practice requires each player’s hard work and dedication in order to perform successfully on the field this weekend.“I tend to think the biggest factors in winning any game are preparedness and attitude,” said Anhut, who put two goals on the scoreboard for the Trojans during their match against Hofstra. “Our coaches really emphasize drilling basic skills out until they’re second nature, so that when we’re in games and might be tired, we are still able execute the way we need to.” Anhut added that scouting the opponent was a crucial part of USC’s success.“While we do prep for each opponent and scout their style of play, I think attention to detail is what ultimately makes us so well prepared,” Anhut said. “In terms of attitude, I think we’ve found success because we have tough athletes that love to win and compete but also because we really enjoy playing together.”To ensure continued success for the Trojans, they must be in a consistent rhythm with one another and have strong communication on the field.    With its season picking up, USC wants to make sure it brings its A-game, especially with the competitive opponents the players will face in the following weeks.The Trojans aren’t letting their past wins against the Aztecs and Dolphins cloud their judgement or efforts to compete at full force. Regardless of past matches and successful efforts, the Trojans are ready to enter the field as an unstoppable powerhouse.   “San Diego State is a solid team that always plays well against us and has had a great start to their season,” Anhut said. “We’re definitely prepared and ready to come out strong.”The Trojans take on SDSU Friday at the Aztec Lacrosse Field at 1 p.m.

After starting the season with a 2-1 record, the Trojans look to maintain their winning form as they host No. 16 Arkansas in a three-game series starting Thursday night.
Last weekend, the Trojans beat University of Nebraska Omaha twice in a three-game series as they opened their season. Despite winning two games, the Trojans demonstrated glimpses of inconsistency against the Mavericks.
The Trojans had trouble starting games over the weekend. On both Friday and Sunday, the Trojans found themselves behind early on in the game and were playing catch-up instead of trying to anchor their lead.
On opening night, the team trailed the entire game until the ninth inning, when senior second baseman Brandon Perez saved the day by hitting a walk-off single to win the game 6-5. On Sunday, USC found itself behind by 11 runs after four and a half innings and was unable to make up that deficit despite scoring 8 unanswered runs late in the game.
Those two performances, however, contrasted Saturday’s game, during which the Trojans looked comfortable and confident throughout each inning. The team did not allow the Mavericks to score early in the game and by the time the Trojans finished the fourth inning, the game was put to bed.
“I just kind of want to preach a calm and level-headed mentality,” Perez said over the weekend. “Just so we don’t have too many highs and too many lows throughout the season. That we just stay consistent throughout.”
The Trojans will need to find some consistency before they take on Arkansas Thursday. The Razorbacks started the season 3-0 by sweeping Eastern Illinois at home over the weekend. Arkansas scored easily, putting up 30 runs in three games. 
While both teams have only played one series so far this season, the Razorbacks have a combined batting average of .376. The Trojans lag somewhat behind, but still boast a strong batting average of .323 thus far.
The Razorbacks will be difficult to pitch against, as they have multiple home run threats in their lineup, with four different players going yard over the weekend. Moreover, the team also holds a slugging percentage of .584.
The Trojans also have players in their lineup who can hit with power. Both senior shortstop Chase Bushor and sophomore right fielder Jamal O’Guinn went yard over the weekend. The Trojans have a slugging percentage of .505 to start the year.
With both teams capable of scoring runs, pitching will be particularly  important. The Trojans gave up 17 runs last weekend while the Razorbacks allowed just 12.
Some pitchers struggled over the weekend for the Trojans, most notably freshman Chandler Champlain. Champlain gave up 5 runs in his first inning on the mound and had to be pulled from his first college start before the inning ended. 
However, sophomore pitcher John Beller was lights out on Saturday, pitching seven scoreless innings against the Mavericks. Beller, who predominantly started midweek games last season, appeared confident on the mound and looks to have a bigger role in the rotation this year.
“I thought [Beller] had some dominant Tuesday starts last year,” head coach Dan Hubbs said after Saturday’s game. “He has a lot of ways to attack you. For a guy who’s not very tall and not very big, he’s got incredible grit. There’s zero fear on the mound when he’s out there. He’s attacking the strike zone, making guys hit his pitch, and you need that.”  
These two teams faced off last March in Arkansas with the Razorbacks winning the series 2-1. Despite losing, the Trojans, who were unranked, played one of their best series of the year against Arkansas, who at the time were ranked No. 5 in the nation.
The two teams split the first two games of the series and the third game went down to the wire. The Trojans led by 1 run going into the final inning of the game, but Arkansas scored twice at the end to claim the series.
While the Trojans are not expected to win all three games in this series, it is critical that they remain competitive throughout the series and avoid blowouts. The team’s confidence should be high, if they manage to keep each game close. 
The first game of the series will take place at 7 p.m. Thursday at Dedeaux Field. There will also be games on Friday and Saturday night, both at 6 p.m.

Wednesday night played host to one of the Christmas-like holidays of the NCAA men’s basketball season — UNC vs. Duke Part I, the first half of one of the most hate-filled, violently competitive games of the year.
The annual clash between these two powerhouse rivals is something to celebrate for a college basketball fan. Year in and year out, it’s a consistent event that eclipses any season records or Top-25 rankings. It really doesn’t matter if North Carolina is on track to another national championship, or if Duke has a fleet of freshman monsters like forward Zion Williamson. In any given year, on any given rivalry day, both teams have an equal chance of beating the other.
I grew up on this type of rivalry. It didn’t matter if it was Chiefs against Raiders or Kansas playing Mizzou; all of my teams hated the hell out of someone else, guaranteeing at least two great rivalry games per season. The beauty of one of these contests was only exacerbated by circumstances — the David and Goliath odds of my (often weaker) team facing a powerhouse or the thrill of watching a sub-zero game played outdoors.
I was hoping for this type of energy, this type of generations-old hatred, when I came to college. I had heard enough tales spun about the bad blood between UCLA and USC, and after watching two teams sharing a state battle it out in Kansas vs. Kansas State, I was ready to see just how much living in the same city upped the ante. After all, I was told that the two schools hated each other — enough to duct tape the statues on campus for rivalry week, enough to burn a bonfire yards high to simulate burning each other’s mascots.
I thought I was signing up for a new type of sports-induced hatred and when I got to campus, I was ready to bask in it. But in my four years at USC, I’ve come to understand that the USC vs. UCLA rivalry, despite all the trash talk and traditions, is in the second tier of sports rivalries. It brings a dull consistency, for sure, a Saturday each football season to circle in order to properly plan for a tailgate. But the actual ferocity of the fandom isn’t at the same level as other schools or other teams, and that lack of fire has left me feeling somewhat left out, as I watch friends around the country bask in their senior years of rivalries.
It’s hard to put a finger on the exact reason that the USC vs. UCLA rivalry feels lesser, but a lot of a it comes from where I grew up. When I was in third grade, my teacher (what’s up, Mrs. O’Neill?) went around the room at the start of one week and asked each of us who we cheered for — KU, K-State or Mizzou. She then rearranged the seating chart to put the KU fans in the front rows of the classroom, the K-State fans in the middle and the Mizzou kids in the very back for the rest of the week. We were 8 freaking years old.
Mrs. O’Neill was a bit of an outlier — her room was basically bathed in crimson and blue from October to March every single year — but that question was a fairly common icebreaker asked in classrooms from first grade on. Where I grew up, our teams were an intrinsic aspect of our identities. We split up by them to play dodgeball in elementary school gym class and wore jerseys for a day of spirit week in high school. Cheering for one of those three colleges — which most of my graduating class ended up attending — was so important that I can still remember, to this day, the college allegiances of almost all of the 70 kids in my grade at elementary school.
So it’s different for state schools like Kansas and K-State, or Nebraska and Iowa. Blame it on the overabundance of wheat and corn fields and the lack of things to do; blame it on small-town ideals (even though I grew up in the suburbs) or the fact that the Midwest is obsessed with basketball. But that still doesn’t explain the ferocity of a rivalry like Duke and North Carolina, two schools that are as academically competitive as USC and UCLA, yet still hate each other much, much more.
I don’t really have an answer to this question. Maybe it’s because those two schools are sequestered in a semi-rural area of North Carolina, with less to do than a bunch of college kids plopped in the dead center of one of the largest cities in the world. Maybe it’s because Duke and North Carolina have kept winning year after year with seasoned, Hall of Fame coaches at the helm, while USC and UCLA have watched their football and basketball teams flounder. Or maybe it’s because we’re both too focused on different sports — UCLA on basketball, USC on football — to breed a rivalry, since we never meet on common ground.
In the end, it doesn’t really matter why this rivalry hasn’t been all that compelling in recent years. The point still stands that our rivalry is second-rate at best, relegated to noon kick-off times and repeated as half-hearted jokes by professors. As my senior year comes to a close, I couldn’t help feeling a little jealous settling in for a true rivalry game like Duke and North Carolina, wondering what could have been, if USC hated UCLA just a little bit more.

Climate change is no longer a matter of science. The scientific backing was revealed decades ago. A literature review conducted by Institute of Physics, Science found that 97 percent of publishing climate scientists believe that humans are causing global warming. 
The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported last year that humans must reduce their resource consumption by an “unprecedented” amount in order to prevent a global temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-1850 levels by 2030. The best scientists in the world believe a temperature increase of this magnitude would have disastrous and irreversible consequences for our water supply, security, health and economic capacity. If we want a future that even resembles our current environmental conditions, we have 11 years to change everything. 
USC only recently started to pull any of its weight in alleviating the climate crisis, but it will soon have a final opportunity to make a sufficient effort.
In 2014, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education released a report measuring the quality of USC’s sustainability efforts. Of the 21 prestigious peer institutions scored by the report, USC ranked last in overall sustainability score — 10 percent worse than the school in second-to-last place and 24 percent below the average. 
Since then, the University has made admirable strides in the right direction. In 2015, the University approved its Sustainability 2020 Plan. For the most part however, USC has made disappointing progress in achieving the majority its sustainability goals.
Of the 60 action items laid out in the Sustainability 2020 Plan, only one goal had a baseline effort that began prior to 2015: A Staff Assembly fair on the issue of sustainability started in 2005. Whatever the cause is, USC has hardly any history of taking action to reduce its environmental footprint, and as a result, there isn’t a sustainability framework upon which the University can further its environmental efforts. 
As Sustainability 2020 comes to a close, however, that framework is starting to take root. We have initiatives in energy and waste reduction in place now that didn’t exist five years ago, all spurred by Sustainability 2020, all granting the ability to think even bigger for 2030.Soon, the University will draft its next set of goals to follow Sustainability 2020. USC will be able to truly demonstrate the compassionate and ambitious qualities it prides itself in through this process. 
USC’s future sustainability goals must outline an explicit effort to eventually reach net zeros in energy, water and waste. This means USC can only consume as much energy as it produces, balance its water usage and limit the amount of waste going to landfills, ideally to nothing. No university has reached net zero in even one of these areas, and most institutions near USC’s size haven’t even gotten close. This is obviously a lofty goal and perhaps an infeasible one to be achieved in the next eight or 10 years, but it is the goal that science demands we reach as soon as possible. The new set of goals must explicitly mandate the creation of the necessary physical and political infrastructure to ensure we meet net zeros by the end of the subsequent plan. 
Doing so will require changing the perception of what is feasible. If buildings cannot physically support solar panels, USC must reinforce those buildings. If partnerships mandate unsustainable waste practices, USC must find new partners. 
Furthermore, the University must centralize its data on sustainability to measure its footprint. Currently, USC has no centralized database on activities like faculty transportation. For example, the Viterbi School of Engineering knows how often its faculty uses air travel, but because that information isn’t pooled by the central University administration, there is no framework in place to accurately measure USC’s ecological footprint. From students to school deans to the University President, everyone at USC must take action, and that action must be spurred by sentiments of accountability, urgency and support from the highest levels of the University. USC must execute its sustainability efforts as a singular unit. 
USC is one of the largest private employers in Southern California. The actions of the school with a $5-billion endowment are not limited by circumstance alone, but by what the University finds worthy of investment. In the past, the environment and, by consequence, human health and well-being, have not been a priority for the University. Time is running out, and if everything must change, USC must as well. The future generations USC aims to educate must be protected by the University.

In the “Harry Potter” series, journalist Rita Skeeter constantly tangles lies into her stories to appeal to her readers. In “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” she suggests that Harry cries at night, mourning the death of his parents; she also accuses the largely harmless Hagrid of mistreating students. In “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” she writes a book about the “disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the lifelong feuds and the guilty secrets” of Hogwarts’ headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. 
While almost all of her writing is rooted in lies, there is another throughline in her work — no matter what the subject is, she writes about it negatively. This could be attributed to her ostensible distaste for Hogwarts and the Daily Prophet’s (her wizarding newspaper employer) bias against Dumbledore and Potter, but her penchant for bad news is also rooted in something else: Negative news sells. 
According to a 2014 McGill University study, subjects who were presented with a news website that contained an equal distribution of negative, positive and neutral stories were 26 percent more likely to choose a negative news story. Skeeter wasn’t only writing negatively because of her and her paper’s political motives, but also because she knew it would be appealing to her audience. 
Like in the fictional world of “Harry Potter,” news organizations in the real world tend to cover mostly bad news, but not because of the readers’ cravings — bad news is often just more newsworthy. 
For the most part, it makes sense that bad news is more prevalent; good news tends to exist within the “norms” of daily life. Journalists would never cover something happening as normal; they write stories when something out of the ordinary happens. 
For example, the Daily Trojan would never write a story about a donor who consistently donates to the Marshall School of Business year after year. It’s great news for the University to have this source of funding, but the newspaper would cover it, at most, as part of a larger story about the University’s progress in achieving its fundraising goals. But if that donor decides to pull his donation because the University’s interim president terminated the Marshall dean they supported, it becomes newsworthy. 
Furthermore, positive changes tend to happen over long periods of time, while bad news happens all at once. In any major newspaper, you’ll see daily stories about individual instances of crime, accidents, epidemics and other negative news. 
And while those individual instances are important to cover, they ignore long-term, mostly positive trends occurring right now. For example, according to a 2017 FBI report, the crime rate across all violent crimes, including murder, robbery and aggravated assault, has decreased in the past 20 years by 184.7 incidents per 100,000 inhabitants, yet news organizations cover individual instances of crime just as much as they did 20 years ago and rarely report on crime reduction rates. 
There’s an old axiom of journalism — “if it bleeds, it leads” — that seems to exemplify the news media’s tendency of reporting on bad news. 
But beyond its mere misrepresentation of the actual state of the world, negative news imposes harmful effects on consumers. Ironically, CNN (probably one of the biggest culprits in news media to sensationalize bad news) published an article in 2018 detailing the stressful effects of bad news.
The article noted that any time consumers hear about a traumatic event, it can cause an overactive fear response, releasing stress hormones in consumers. Because of the never-ending news cycle on social media, it is hard not to be exposed to traumatic events, whether they are earthquakes in a faraway country or local murders. This constant exposure and release of stress hormones causes fatigue, and can lead to longer term symptoms like anxiety, insomnia and depression, CNN reported. 
Now more than ever, news media has a moral responsibility to turn this negative tide around. Journalists must reflect their communities accurately. If they overrepresent the amount of negative news, they are directly contributing to their consumers’ moods and overall well-being. 
Journalists should consider: Is the story they’re trying to tell necessary, or just a way to use a traumatic event to get clicks? Is there an important story they’re missing because it took place over a decade? 
Some media organizations are taking it upon themselves to cover only positive news — websites like Upworthy and the Good News Network only publish feel-good content. It might seem like a naive way to report on  the world, but both sites are designed to act as supplements to major news organizations who  primarily report on bad news. 
Consumers can also have an effect on what news is reported — after all, readers are more likely to click on a negative news story than a positive one, which leads to news organizations’ increasing coverage of negative stories. News consumers should take the time to read feel-good stories and avoid negative stories that aren’t relevant to them — it’s not only good for the overall state of news, but it’s beneficial to the audience’s mental health. 
Of course, bad news isn’t something news media can completely ignore — it’s often the most important news. But both consumers and journalists should reconsider their priorities in newsgathering and news consumption. 
Karan Nevatia is a sophomore writing about media ethics and literacy. He is also an associate managing editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “Dear Rita Skeeter,” runs every other Thursday.

One can often find professor Caitlyn Conlin working in a hospital -— but not in a traditional medical profession. Conlin, sporting a red nose, interacts with young hospitalized patients through the art of medical clowning, which is targeted at transforming the experience of hospitalization for patients.
Conlin and professor Zachary Steel from the School of Dramatic Arts teach the medical clowning courses. Along with their instructors, students are able to go to hospitals to apply what they have learned in class and build long-term bonds with patients.
The course explores the philosophies of medical clowning and offers students opportunities to perform in hospitals. Steel said that in the class, students learn the principles of theatrical clowning to reveal the “most innocent and pure” parts of themselves to pursue joy and take this newly discovered joy to hospitals.  
“The philosophy of clowning … when you  participate in a medical clowning class, you do exercises that allow you to tap into a certain state of being that is completely free and has unlimited imagination,” Conlin said. 
Conlin also said medical clowning is all about improvisation and intimate interaction with patients and the environment.
“When I go into the hospital, I have nothing planned,” she said. “I mean, I do have songs that I know that I’ll sing sometime when singing comes up, but I don’t plan what I’m going to sing. A lot of times I don’t plan what song I’m going to sing and a lot of times I make up songs … You are pushing yourself into unknown places and a sort of magic starts to happen in the moment. ” 
Conlin said the magic of medical clowning lies not only in healing patients but also in giving hope to patients’ families. When Conlin and Steel met with an unconscious patient, the nurse said there was not much the medical clowns could do. However, the patient’s mother called them in, and they said they were able to successfully implore the mother’s experience in the hospital.
According to Conlin, by interacting with the patients actively, the medical clowns are able to gain trust from patients and create beautiful memories with them. She improvised a performance to engage with a shy boy.
“I started interacting with different objects in the hallway around the room and pretending that they were alive,” Conlin said. “Doctors and nurses were passing through the hallway,  and I turned it into a parade … a beautiful, amazing parade.” 
Conlin said she accompanied the boy on his way to the operation room and made him feel comfortable.
Steel said that medical clowning may also give hope to patients’ families. On one visit with unconscious patient, Conlin and Steel said they were able to change the mother’s experience at the hospital.
“It’s very meaningful to the mother to have someone treating her daughter with the same feeling of aliveness… That was really important for the mother to keep the hope going,” Conlin said.      
Conlin said that children and adult patients have different responses to medical clowns. She said adults are at first more hesitant to open themselves to more creative outlets.
But once patients have experienced medical clowning, Conlin said they realize the clowns can tailor the experience to their age and topics they want to discuss. 
“If someone wants to talk about their trip to Alaska, the clown will play with that,” Conlin said. “If someone wants to talk about monsters and zombies, then the clown will do that. So the content is different, but the play is still the same.” 
There are rules to medical clowning because of the environment that the hospitals provide. Steel said a medical clown should avoid speaking loudly and remember to be respectful to their surroundings.
“You are only doing what you are given the permission to do by the patients,” Steel said.
However, Steel said that surprises are needed sometimes because they want to promote optimism in hospital environments. They want patients to feel comfortable with their surroundings.
As opposed to other types of clowning, medical clowning aims to build one-to-one immersive interactions with patients, rather than facing a large audience. Christina Chow, a senior majoring in biological sciences who is currently taking Steel and Conlin’s class. 
“It’s really not about ‘Oh, look at me, I’m a clown on stage,’” Chow said. “It’s like, ‘OK, I’m here for you.’”
