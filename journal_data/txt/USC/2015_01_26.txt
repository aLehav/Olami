In less than one week, the champion of Super Bowl XLIX will be crowned the best team in the NFL. Will it be the defending champion Seattle Seahawks, or the controversial New England Patriots? Will Pete Carroll win his second consecutive Super Bowl, or will Brady add a fourth ring to his collection?
I don’t know, and you’ve come to the wrong place if you’re looking for speculation on the Big Game.
Don’t get me wrong. I love football just as much as the next person, but for the past week all I have seen on TV or read about in the newspaper is either in regards to Deflategate or Super Bowl XLIX. Hopefully I can provide you with a break from the monotony.
In one month, pitchers and catchers will report to training camp in Phoenix for their first spring workout of 2015. That means we’re one step closer to opening day and the return of America’s favorite pastime.
Come April, Dodger Stadium will be home to a very different Dodger team.
The 2014 Dodgers won a second straight National League West Championship. To most, the Dodgers’ 2014 season would be considered a success, but to the Dodgers, the season ended in another disappointment. That’s because for the second consecutive year, the St. Louis Cardinals knocked the Dodgers out of the playoffs in the National League Division Series. To add insult to injury, the rival Giants pulled off a Cinderella story to win the World Series.
Between the 2013 and 2014 seasons, the Dodgers made minimal changes and consequently saw minimal results in 2014. This year, the Dodgers immediately began making changes as soon as their season ended.
The first major change was the demotion of Ned Colletti from general manager to senior advisor to the president. The Dodgers hired the A’s assistant general manager Farhan Zaidi as director of baseball operations.
Zaidi’s areas of expertise are providing statistical analysis for evaluating and targeting players in the amateur draft, free agent and trade markets. Zaidi will oversee the Dodgers’ scouting and player development.
After Zaidi’s arrival, the Dodgers didn’t wait long to start clearing out the old and making room for the new.
Most notably, the Dodgers traded All-Star outfielder Matt Kemp, catcher Tim Federowicz and $32 million to the San Diego Padres in exchange for catcher Yasmani Grandal and pitchers Joe Wieland and Zach Eflin.
Kemp was an asset to the Dodgers who had the ability to elevate the team and make them better as a whole, but was consistently plagued with injuries. Kemp’s departure also solves the problem the Dodgers had in 2014 with four outfielders rotating between three positions. The Dodgers also sent All-Star infielder Dee Gordon, who led the National League in stolen bases, to the Miami Marlins.
Though the Dodgers parted ways with two All-Star players, they added veterans to the roster. In the same trade that sent Kemp to the Padres, the Dodgers acquired shortstop Jimmy Rollins from the Philadelphia Phillies. The Boys in Blue also signed former Angels second baseman Howie Kendrick in the deal that sent Gordon to Florida.
In nearly every trade the Dodgers have made this season, they have placed a premium on depth in the pitching rotation and defense. The Dodgers let go of slugger Kemp and lead-off hitter Gordon for sturdy defense in Rollins and Kendrick. The biggest statement the Dodgers made in favor of a stronger defense was parting with clean-up hitter Hanley Ramirez, who cost Clayton Kershaw a perfect game with a defensive error in June.
According to Dodgers manager Don Mattingly, the loss of offensive power is balanced by the team’s stronger defense, because “you don’t need to score as many runs when you limit and give up less runs.”
Despite leading off the rotation with National League Cy Young and MVP Award winner Clayton Kershaw, and number two pitcher Zack Greinke, who would be an ace on almost any other team, the Dodgers struggled with depth in the rotation.
The 2014 Dodgers were a team of egos and tension that banded together to win 94 games but were humbled for the second-straight year in the post-season.
This year, the Dodgers have made changes in hopes of executing a more successful playoff run ending in a World Series victory. The Dodgers are a talented team more than capable of winning it all, but probably not with as much regular season dominance.
To quote Mattingly again, “I think the pieces fit together more as a baseball team than a collection of talent.”

After an up-and-down first season with a new coach, the Trojans head into their offseason with optimism. With starting quarterback Cody Kessler returning for his senior season and a litany of young, talented skill players, the Trojans are headed in the right direction. That momentum has translated to the high school recruiting scene.
One year ago, head coach Steve Sarkisian was able to land a consensus top-15 recruiting class. The 19-man 2014 class ultimately produced impact players such as Adoree’ Jackson, Juju Smith, Toa Lobendahn, Damien Mama, Viane Talamaivao, Bryce Dixon and John Plattenburg, all of whom saw significant playing time this past season. Not only did the current coaching staff close strongly last National Signing Day, they did it in a couple of months under scholarship limitations.
This time around, Steve Sarkisian and staff are aiming higher than a top-15 class. For the first time since 2010, USC will be able to assemble a full recruiting class of 25 players. The 2015 crop of players out of California is said by recruiting experts to be one of the strongest in recent years. Furthermore, the relative lack of depth across the board has made USC an even more attractive option for blue-chip high school football prospects.
Every football team starts with the quarterback position. The 2015 recruiting class includes two quarterbacks, each with contrasting styles. Ricky Town, a former Alabama commit, was converted  by Steve Sarkisian and his staff. Town, a pro-style quarterback, has been one of the leaders of the 2015 class and an active presence for USC at the national recruiting camps. Sam Darnold, another quarterback commit, breaks the mold of the traditional USC pocket quarterback. Darnold is more of a dual-threat quarterback who often likes to make plays outside of the pocket with both his arm and his feet.
Last year’s recruiting class consisted of very talented offensive linemen. This year’s class will likely do more of the same and add depth to the offensive line as the Trojans look to utilize a hurry-up, no-huddle offense. The 2015 offensive line class is headlined by Chuma Edoga, from Powder Springs, Georgia. In addition to Edoga, the class looks to include offensive linemen Clayton Johnston, Roy Hemsley and Cole Smith.
With redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen leaving for the NFL draft, the running back depth chart dwindles to two scholarship running backs, Tre Madden and Justin Davis. As a result, the USC coaching staff looks to sign three very different running backs. Aca’Cedric Ware, is a physical, between-the-tackles runner who averaged above 8 yards per carry in high school. Dominic Davis, a smaller player, is the speedster of the running back class. Davis’ catching ability allows the offensive staff the flexibility to use him as a slot receiver in certain formations. The third running back of the USC 2015 recruiting class is Ronald Jones II. Jones, a hybrid of Davis and Ware, has the durability to run between the tackles as well as the speed and vision to make big plays in the running game.
Even with the loss of Nelson Agholor and George Farmer to the NFL, it appears the USC coaches look to only add two wide receiver recruits. Both De’Quan Hampton and Isaac Whitney are junior college recruits with two and three years of eligibility respectively. Both receivers are similar in that each is more than 6 feet tall, which is a necessity for an offense that throws many bubble screens.
Rounding out the offensive recruits is Tyler Petite, a tight end from California. Originally committed to Duke, Petite switched his commitment to USC. For an offense with only two scholarship tight ends, Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick and Bryce Dixon, the commitment of Petite was crucial from a depth standpoint.
In the current college football landscape, which includes hurry-up offenses and zone read running attacks, it is imperative to have a strong defensive line. The 2015 defensive line class includes the current commitments of Noah Jefferson, Christian Rector and Jacob Daniel. Daniel has the size to occupy multiple blockers and clog running lanes, Rector is seen as a rush defensive end with a high motor, and Jefferson is an athletic 280-pounder who can get to the quarterback and stop the run. Furthermore, USC appears to be the heavy favorite to land Rasheem Green, a five-star defensive tackle from the Los Angeles area. With the loss of Leonard Williams, USC will need the 2015 recruits to make an impact on the defensive line within the next two years.
In defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox’s 3-4 defensive scheme, the linebackers play the most important role: they are called upon to make tackles in the run game and also cover tight ends and receivers out of the back field. As a result, linebackers must be big enough to tackle and shed blockers while still being agile enough to drop into coverage. The 2015 linebacker class looks to do just that. Currently, USC has commitments from Cameron Smith and Osa Masina. Smith is more of a punisher and built in the mold of Hayes Pullard, the Trojans’ leading tackler. Masina, at 6 feet 4 inches and weighing around 230 pounds, is an incredibly fluid athlete for his size. The Trojans are also in the driver’s seat for two other highly regarded linebacking recruits, Porter Gustin and John Houston. Gustin, also at 6 feet 5 inches, is a very physical player with great pass rushing ability. Houston is an incredibly athletic linebacker with great coverage and pass rushing ability. Should USC close both Gustin and Houston, it would allow Justin Wilcox greater flexibility to disguise coverages and blitzes.
This past season, the USC secondary started cornerback Jackson and safety Plattenburg as true freshmen. The 2014 secondary class made an instant impact, and this year’s class looks poised to do the same. As of now, USC has commitments from cornerback Isaiah Langley and safety prospects Marvell Tell and Ykili Ross, all three athletic. Tell and Ross, in particular, have great size at safety. Both players are more than 6 feet tall; their length, speed and ball skills would make it difficult for opposing teams to throw the ball over the top of the defense. Additionally, the Trojans remain in contention to land Iman Marshall, a five-star cornerback widely regarded as the top defensive back in the country. Marshall, a Long Beach native and former teammate of Juju Smith, would solidify a secondary many analysts consider amongst the best in college football.
USC’s first full recruiting class in years looks poised to be amongst the very best. The 2015 recruiting class is projected to be in the top three, and will be a cornerstone in USC’s quest for a 12th national championship.

Ten months ago, Sabrina Santamaria was not playing tennis. She couldn’t even walk.
In her sophomore season, Santamaria was at one point ranked the No. one singles player in the country. Everything changed the day she fell to the court clutching her knee. Writhing in agony, Santamaria was about to embark on one of the most challenging treks any athlete can face. She had torn her anterior cruciate ligament.
An ACL injury is season-ending and often has the potential to be career-ending, but Santamaria took her future into her own hands. To say that the injury was devastating would be an understatement. The Women of Troy were looking to make a run to team championships, but Santamaria did not falter in her conviction that she could still help the team. Immediately following her injury, USC played two tough matches against UCLA and Baylor. They lost both.
When discussing her injury, it is obvious that there is a natural stage of doubt, such as, “why me,”, “this can’t be happening to me,” and “what would we have been able to do if I hadn’t gotten hurt?” Santamaria quickly overcame this mental obstacle and embraced her role as a cheerleader for the rest of the squad.
“I felt like I let my team down,” Santamaria said. “Then I was just supporting the team as best I could.”
Following her injury, her doubles partner and best friend, Kaitlyn Christian, would often spend the night in her room helping her do the most mundane activities that she physically could not do, such as getting in and out of bed. Santamaria cites the physical challenge of rehab as the most difficult, especially when she felt she should have been able to do more than she was capable of.
Santamaria made her debut back on the court against Loyola Marymount in which she clinched the match in a fairytale ending to what has been a truly remarkable comeback.
“I’m 100 percent with my knee. I totally trust it,” Santamaria said. “I’m actually faster on my sprints than I was last season.”
For Santamaria, tennis is a family affair. Her father, an avid tennis player, immigrated to the United States from Panama, and her mother immigrated from the Philippines. The two met playing tennis in a Los Angeles park.
Santamaria cites her father as her driving force in pursuing her tennis dreams. He has coached her all her life and initiated her interest in tennis as a young girl. At the age of 4, her father bought her the first of many tennis rackets and strung a tennis ball to the ceiling of their apartment, giving his daughter simple instructions: “whack the ball.”
“My dad has been my coach my whole life,” Santamaria said.
This spawned Santamaria’s own love story, that of her and the game of tennis.
The list of Santamaria’s accolades rolls on and on. It is equal in size and length, however, to the list of goals she maintains for her future tennis career. Santamaria has a work ethic like none other. She takes her past successes and channels them into motivation to get there again in the future.
Santamaria’s favorite memory of collegiate tennis is clinching the quarterfinal match against Stanford her freshman year in the NCAA team championship. In an intense match in which the score was 3-2, Santamaria won her set against an opponent she had never beaten and quickly found herself at the bottom of a dog pile consisting of her ecstatic teammates.
To finish off her sophomore season, Santamaria and then doubles partner Christian won the NCAA doubles championship. With the victory, the pair garnered a wild card spot in the US Open. Feeling inspired despite a loss, Santamaria acknowledged the fact that playing in the US Open has been a dream since her childhood, and all she wants to do is get back there.
“After the loss, all I wanted to do was find a way to get back on the courts,” Santamaria said. “It made me hungrier.”
The way Santamaria nonchalantly mentioned her appearance in the US Open into conversation demonstrates her casual humility. She isn’t afraid to put her head down and fight for what she wants.
Santamaria has two main goals for this season: to win a team championship and to win a singles championship. A singles title would give Santamaria the wild card bid she desperately wants in order to play in the US Open once again.
With one semester of school left, Santamaria hopes to begin her play in pro circuits and ultimately get a full schedule of tournaments that will result in the fulfillment of her true dream, which is to see the world.
Santamaria fell in love with Europe after she spent two weeks traveling to 10 different countries with Christian.
A self-proclaimed tomboy who grew up loving hiking and the great outdoors, . Her favorite activity in Los Angeles is hiking in Griffith Park and getting to see the skyline of the city, another reason she loves Los Angeles.

The USC women’s basketball team came back to the Galen Center looking to bounce back from a tough 71-60 loss to UCLA. Unfortunately, they fell victim to costly mistakes and unfortunate bounces, suffering a 67-53 loss to California on Friday, and falling 71-60 to No. 11 Stanford on Sunday.
Senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama led the Women of Troy (11-8, 3-5 Pac-12) with 15 points, six rebounds and three steals against the Golden Bears. Redshirt sophomore guard Jordan Adams finished with 12 points, and freshman forward Kristen Simon finished with six points and 11 rebounds. California’s  (13-5, 5-2 Pac-12) Reshanda Gray led the team with 15 points, nine rebounds and three blocks, as all five Cal starters finished with double-digit points.
The game was back-and-forth from the start, with both sides taking advantage of turnovers and missed opportunities on the other end of the floor. USC jumped out to an early 7-4 lead, but Cal stormed back with a 6-0 run. The Golden Bears would go on to take a 15-13 lead, but the Women of Troy went on an 8-0 scoring run, which Cal responded to with a 7-0 run of their own. The teams would continue to battle it out until halftime, as USC headed to the locker room down 27-26, as the first half contained eight ties and seven lead changes.
Both teams turned the ball over eight times, but USC got 10 points off those turnovers compared to Cal’s eight. For the third straight game, the Women of Troy were scoreless from behind-the-arc, going 0-for-4 from downtown, but out-rebounded the Bears     27-17.
USC scored the first basket of the second half on a                                                              three-pointer by McKenzie Calvert. Cal would take control of the game from there, however, using their balanced scoring attack to put the game out of reach and pull out the win on the road, thanks to 62 percent shooting from the field.
“At the end of the day, when you play a really good team like Cal, you’ve got to come in in the second half and play well,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “You cannot lose your intensity, and I thought we did that, and as a result, Cal came out, they made an early run. We missed a couple lay-ups, a couple shots that we normally make, and I thought we lost our confidence a little bit, and it was an uphill battle from there.”
“I thought we did some really good things. We rebounded, we defended, especially in the first half, and we have to go back to the drawing board in the second half and really focus on bringing that intensity and bringing that focus for 40 minutes.”
USC hoped to bounce back against No. 11 Stanford behind a much louder Galen Center. Despite consistent play throughout, an early run by Stanford ended up being too much to overcome for the Women of Troy.
Adams led the Women of Troy with 21 points and 10 rebounds against the Cardinal for her first career double-double. Junior guard Brianna Barrett scored 15 points, and senior forward Kaneisha Horn finished with 11 points and 11 rebounds for her second career double-double.
Lili Thompson led Stanford (15-5, 7-1 Pac-12) with 21 points. Erica McCall added 11 points and six rebounds.
The Women of Troy got off to another strong start against the Cardinal, starting the scoring with a 3-pointer from Adams after going a combined 0-for-14 from downtown in the first half of the past three games. The first half looked to be about identical to the Cal game, with the lead constantly changing sides. After the Cardinal built an 8-5 lead, USC went on a 7-0 run behind strong offensive rebounding. However, a 15-1 run by Stanford aided by USC turnovers put them back on top, and they wouldn’t relinquish the lead from there.
The Women of Troy would cut the deficit down to six, but Stanford would enter the locker room with a 36-27 lead at the half, thanks to 55 percent shooting from the field and 10-of-11 from the free-throw line.
USC kept it competitive behind their rebounding, as they out-rebounded the Cardinal                19-17 at the half, including 10-2 on the offensive glass, leading to 10 second-chance points.
The second half played out similarly to the first, with the Women of Troy unable to make a huge dent in the deficit. The Cardinal led by as many as 17 in the second half, as they cruised to a win. They finished shooting 50 percent from the field and 42 percent from downtown, compared to 36 percent and 27 percent, respectively. Stanford also went to the free-throw line 24 times, making 20 of those, while USC was only 8-of-16 from the charity stripe.
“I think we didn’t do well in our rotation, in our zone, and it killed us,” Horn said. “They got some wide-open three’s, and a lot of post-slips, that killed us a lot. They were just wide open, and I think if we had executed on that, it would have been a different game.”
“For the most part, I felt we got better,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I just don’t think we were able to get over the hump. We came out in the second half with the right level of intensity. Stanford was just very good with moving the ball around, sharing the ball, making the extra pass and making it very difficult to cover everyone. We tried some different defenses, and I thought we were effective for the most part in the second half. We just struggled finishing with Stanford’s sagging defense.”
Rebounding and inside scoring continued to be a strong point for the Women of Troy, who              out-rebounded the Cardinal      41-32 and 20-5 on the offensive glass. They picked up 20 second-chance points and 36 points in the paint, compared to five and 22 for Stanford, respectively.
The Women of Troy will look to end their three-game skid next week to take on    No. 9 Oregon State (18-1, 8-0            Pac-12) on Saturday, Jan. 31 at 2:30             p.m.       and Oregon (8-11, 1-7 Pac-12) on Monday, Feb. 2 at 5:00 p.m. They will then return to the Galen Center, looking to sweep the season series against Utah  (6-13, 0-8 Pac-12) on Friday, Feb. 6 at 7 p.m. and Colorado (9-9, 2-5   Pac-12) on Sunday, Feb. 8 at noon.

Los Angeles is home to many cafes, including a few with outdoor seating where patrons can enjoy a cup of coffee with their dogs. This weekend, patrons at one Downtown location were able to enjoy a drink and play with some puppies looking for a permanent home. Call it a “pup-up” cafe.
The Dog Café was situated in downtown Los Angeles for only four days. Patrons could buy their coffee outside from coffee trucks and then enjoy it inside while playing with the dogs. Admission cost $15 at the door, but there was also the option to buy in advance at the cafe’s Indiegogo page and even schedule your guaranteed playtime.
Aside from getting dogs — provided by the local shelter Wags and Walks — adopted, the goal -this weekend was to raise enough money to make the cafe a permanent fixture. According to the cafe’s Indigogo page, the founders are trying to raise at least $200,000 to cover rent, renovations, furnishing and staffing. Thus far, they have raised $14,626.
The Dog Café is Sarah Wolfgang’s latest venture in volunteering with shelter dogs. She began helping to place dogs in foster and permanent homes in Korea, and she started her own animal relocation program for special needs animals before coming to America.
“I began to volunteer and foster for a private shelter in Korea at the age of 14 to cope with the loss of my first childhood dog, a brilliant and loving poodle named Shadow,” Wolfgang said on her Indigogo page.
The idea for the Dog Café is a generally simple one. More than 5,000 dogs were adopted last year in Los Angeles County. People tend to adopt the shelter dogs that have the most personality, or, at the very least, seem happy to see humans through a cage. Often the metal enclosure dampens the experience because neither the dogs nor potential adopters are comfortable. A pound or a shelter can be sometimes be an overwhelming environment with rows upon rows of caged dogs barking and yipping in chorus.
“After recently moving to the U.S., I realized there was a greater intake of dogs than there were adoptions,” Wolfgang wrote.
The Dog Café sets to change that. Wolfgang hopes to find homes for at least 104 dogs in the first year.
“I realized a dog café would be the perfect solution to giving these shelter dogs a second chance at a forever home,” she said on the website.
The Dog Café takes away the cages and allows the dogs and people to freely interact with each other. In this way, a dog’s personality can truly show without the impedance of a shelter environment, making them more likely to be adopted. On the other hand, even if your apartment does not allow dogs, the Dog Café provides an opportunity to spend time with a canine companion as an alternative to adopting one. It’s a win-win situation.
“I think it’s a neat concept,” said Amy Rotchford, a local resident who was walking by to check out the sounds of barking as she shopped in Downtown. “My husband and I have two rescue dogs right now and before them, our first German Shepherd was a rescue we got when he was 3 years old. And they have all been amazing, caring pets.”
Wolfgang checked with Los Angeles Department of Health to ensure the Dog Café was legal. According to Wolfgang, there shouldn’t be any problem as long as the area where the coffee is made and served is separate from the where the dogs are located.
Grounds and Hounds Coffee Co. supplies the caffeine for the Dog Café in addition to donating 20 percent of all of their profits to partner rescue operations. The dogs are from Wags and Walks, a rescue shelter located in West Los Angeles. They do not take in specific breeds or sizes, but rather handpick their dogs based on personality, according to their website.
There are a variety of options to donate to Wolfgang’s dream of opening a permanent Dog Café. A donation of $25 guarantees entrance and coffee for one day within the first month of opening while $75 allows the donator to drop-in up to eight times within the first year of opening. For dog enthusiasts, a donation of $500 gives them the opportunity to hold a private puppy party. The café provides the puppies for up to nine attendees and includes 12 drop-in opportunities.
The Dog Café is the first of its kind in the United States. Wolfgang hopes it can be an opportunity to give dogs that have been deemed “unadoptable” a second chance at finding a home. The cafe will remain a pop-up business until Wolfgang raises enough funds to make it a permanent business. The concept seems to have been well received by many dog-lovers.
“I think if I could play with the dog I would take it home because I would know he liked me and I like dogs,” said 7-year-old Dree Rotchford, who visited the cafe.
The pup-up was open on 838 South Los Angeles Blvd. on Jan. 22 to Jan. 25.

Leaving sparse, emotional sounds behind for their sophomore album, Los Angeles-based band Milo Greene is all grown up. Their new album Control, out for download on iTunes today, will mark a departure from the folk sound the band put out four years ago and brings their fans careening fast into 2015 with a groovy soundtrack filled with moody basslines and smokey lyrics.
The album opens with “White Lies,” a punchy break-up song filled with band member Marlana Sheetz’s haughty vocals. Though not the best song on the album, “White Lies” still sets the bar high for Control to deliver cool beats and pop lyrics that are sure to become hits and create great live shows.
“This album is a time capsule of our past year writing together [as a band],” bandmember and USC alumnus Graham Finke said. “A lot of our first material was just acoustic guitar, us getting to know each other and singing. This time we started with drum grooves, and it really shows how much we have changed over the year,” Fink’s favorite track from the album, “Lonely Eyes,” comes second to last and shows how the band has evolved together into a songwriting powerhouse. A synth-heavy drum line and fun lyrics make “Lonely Eyes” something that could be heard spinning from a DJ booth at a trendy Los Angeles bar in Hollywood. After listeners sit through “Lonely Eyes,” they’ll quickly realize that what Milo Greene has done is something like magic.
Starting as a group of friends who wrote music and enjoyed spending time together, Milo Greene lacked the cohesion and steadiness found in Control in their eponymous first album. In this one, there is a continuity and intentionality that takes it from a fun, lazy evening, pregame playlist to an album listeners will be telling their friends about for weeks.
According to Fink, all of the band members have their own personal tastes, which comprise the major influences for the album.
“We all love ’90s R&B. Boys 2 Men is actually on our preshow playlist,” said Fink.
In this album, listeners can also hear innovative beats reminiscent of the Talking Heads and Prince.
The 10th track on the album, “Lie To Me,” has a beachy, California vibe, and the potential to be a huge summer anthem. Upbeat, but also well written and expertly produced, “Lie To Me” doesn’t have the dark undertones found in other tracks on the album. Instead, the male and female vocals encourage happy go-lucky sing-alongs and will remind listeners of retro road trips with their windows down.
The process of writing Control was vastly different from that of their first album, according to Fink.
“We really had to trust each other this time around,” Fink said. “The first album came out before we were really a band — they were just songs written between friends that turned out to be something really special. This time, we had to learn how to trust each other, and to take criticism from each other, because that’s what this band is, four people signing off on these ideas.”
Fink used the words “time capsule” to describe Control more than once during his interview, showing that this album is really a representation of how Milo Greene has grown, innovated and developed since their inception four years ago.
The album’s fifth track, “Heartless,” sounds similar to the style of one of Milo Greene’s contemporaries, southern California’s very own  Haim.
“Heartless” defines Control and Milo Greene as a leading member of a new pack of edgy, electro pop that is beginning to take over the music scene. If fans have a hard time adjusting to Milo Greene’s evolving identity, it is hard to imagine how else they could be happy. Recognizing a band’s growth and evolving tastes is a crucial part of being a dedicated music lover.
The album ends with “Royal Blue,” an acoustic crooner that assures listeners that they were, in fact, listening to Milo Greene for the whole album. That being said, Control is definitely a welcome departure from a maybe passé pop-folk trend.
Hip, innovative, and excellently produced, Control is a perfect collection of pop songs to christen the spring of 2015. Milo Greene will be performing a headlining tour of Control this spring and coming to the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles on Feb. 19 .

When Saturday Night Live released a skit mocking the press conferences that followed the New England Patriots’ “Deflategate,” it was not far off from the reality. The skit was made more to mock the media coverage, as many news outlets have been treating the scandal as a much more earth-shattering event than many believe it to be.
The deflated balls obviously did not cause the Patriots’ win. Deflation serves only the quarterback, Tom Brady. In fact, even the opposing team’s Indianapolis Colts players tweeted after the game that the inflation of footballs had nothing to do with the loss; the Patriots simply ran over them.
With the Patriots so clearly in control of the outcome of that game, it’s ridiculous to be treating the scandal like it will actually have any impact on the Super Bowl. The importance of Deflategate, then, lies with the history and future career of Brady and head coach Bill Belichick.
The Brady-Belichick era has been marked with excellence. The two of them have bagged three Super Bowls, and they are both arguably the best at what they do. Belichick being in the conversation for the best coach ever puts him on the fast track to be memorialized, but now, the packaged deal of Brady and Belichick is going to have a new twist to it.
Had a documentary been made about the Brady-Belichick duo without Deflategate, it would have been mostly on amazing feats of the partnership. Now, their storyline has this ridiculous scandal tacked on to it, and given the amount of media outcry that it has already attracted, one can be sure a documentary would do the same kind of unnecessary digging.
The next twist is Brady’s new contract. Up until December, Brady’s salary was guaranteed for the next three seasons, meaning that the Patriots could only get out of that contract if Brady retired or was traded. Now, he’s on a contract guaranteed only for injury, which theoretically frees up $24 million for the Patriots that would otherwise have to be deposited in advance.
The Patriots made this look like a selfless move on Brady’s part to make it easier for his team to pull in more talent. Given that the Patriot’s owner is worth $4 billion, however, it’s hard to believe that the Patriots had to put Brady’s guaranteed contract on the backburner just to save a little money. And even so, it’s not like the team still doesn’t have to pay him, they’re just giving themselves more money to play with during the season.
Grantland writer Bill Barnwell’s theory is that Brady signed the new contract for more flexibility. After a stunning loss in October, there were whispers that Brady feared for his career, and “under his old deal, Brady wouldn’t have been able to move on easily, because the Patriots would have been loath to pay the guaranteed money were they to release their longtime quarterback.”
The chances of Brady actually leaving the Patriots for another team are slim, but for Patriots fans, even the possibility is a blow. Deflategate wouldn’t be enough to get him to leave, but with Belichick and the entire city of Boston blaming Brady, Patriots fans better think about how their team would fare without him.
Deflategate doesn’t mean the end of the football as we know it. With the Boston media joining Belichick in throwing the signal-caller under the bus, for the first time in more than a decade, Patriots fans are confronted with the possibility of a life after Brady. Deflategate has forced many to consider the mortality of a man who has been a mainstay for a generation of football fans.

With the Super Bowl looming, many football lovers are gearing up for the face-off between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks. Recently, though, the fandemonium has turned not to the game, but to the ball itself. In the Jan. 18 game that led to their Super Bowl qualification, the Patriots raised a question of whether deflated footballs contributed to their win, giving the team an unfair advantage in their 45-7 win. This prompted a massive controversy, “Deflategate.” The incident, however, bears low significance, as the NFL already has many other ethical issues to resolve, some of which actually put players’ lives at stake.
Hannah Luk | Daily Trojan
Football runs chiefly fairness to both playing teams. Deflategate might be an obstruction to the NFL’s pillars of fairness, but the many other faults of the football league deserve even more attention than this scandal. In recent years, there have been instances of calling that people have deemed grossly unjust. In 2012, the game between the Green Bay Packers and the Seahawks resulted in questionable calls. The two referees on the field were both replacements for the contract-negotiating regulars. The last play ended up with one referee calling Packers interception and one calling a Seahawks victory. After much review, the win was given to the Seahawks. Replays denoting a Packer interference was irrelevant. Ultimately, this incident signified that football is an arena of supreme subjectivity. Deflategate’s attraction of debate is inevitable and also fickle.
Moreover, the NFL needs to evaluate its player conduct code. Scandals surrounding players include Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick and his dog-fighting ring involvement, an infringement on animal rights. Of greater concern is that, according to USA Today, 85 of the 713 NFL player arrests up until 2014 were due to domestic violence, a statistic that came at the heels of a video of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice beating his wife in an elevator. And to those who are still concerned about the fairness of football, steroid use and, more recently, Adderall use have been prevalent on the fields, giving players dishonest game enhancement and concentration. These issues are more important because they reflect the representation of a team.
The most important issue, however, is how the NFL treats its players. The NFL is a staple of consumer culture, and its players are pawns to earn profits. The league’s responsibility, then, is to ensure the safety of their players, but medical research shows otherwise. Reports have surfaced about the NFL’s lack of responsibility in preventing player concussions. Blunt-force head trauma leads football players to develop chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Effects such as memory loss and depression are often not realized until players are retired. Several former NFL players have committed suicide resulting from this condition. Neurologist Dr. Ann McKee found last year that 76 of the 79 brains of former NFL players showed CTE post-mortem, a fact that the NFL has tried to hide. The prevention of brain deaths is much more important than whether or not some footballs were slightly deflated.
So, maybe there was some merit in that ridiculous speech by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Deflategate is no ISIS, but it also reveals how much we give in to the NFL, ignoring more pressing issues. At the end of the day, it’s not a question of one team’s integrity but the integrity of the league itself.
