Asian Pacific American Student Services, Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and El Centro Chicano collaborated with the American Studies and Ethnicity Club and Panhellenic Council to host Project ReMiX: Cultural Appropriation or Appreciation: Naming It & Reclaiming It! -— an interactive dialogue on the fine line between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation.

Cultural appropriation refers to the use of another culture’s customs, ranging from costumes to behaviors, without permission from the community.
“Many students have expressed to us that there has been problems with cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation at USC, and that they would love a safe space to discuss it, raise awareness and come up with solutions together as a community with their fellow peers,” said William N. Vela, director of El Centro Chicano, in an email to the Daily Trojan.
The topic was an important one, due to many students’ personal experiences with cultural appropriation at USC in the recent past. The organizations aimed to create a safe platform for students to discuss the issue.
“Panhellenic Council partnered with the Cultural Center earlier this semester when we held diversity training workshops for the chapters, going through formal recruitment during recruitment school. In those workshops, we discussed the constructs surrounding stereotypes and assumptions,” said Harleen Marwah, vice president of external relations for the Panhellenic Council, in an e-mail to the Daily Trojan.
The event encouraged participants to work towards dissecting the constructs surrounding the distinction between appropriation and appreciation. Project ReMiX served as an interactive program that explores the intersectionality of identities of students from various ethnic and racial backgrounds. In order to create a culture of inclusion, Project ReMiX aimed to educate, engage and empower participants to understand how the complexity of their identities are linked to issues of social justice.
“Research indicates that the cultural appropriation is an issue in colleges and universities across the country: it is a very timely and relevant topic to discuss. We also want to take a proactive approach and raise awareness amongst our student body, while also building stronger relationships of students across disciplines and groups ultimately leading to stronger community, more informed decision making and hopefully more collaborations,” Vela said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
As the name suggests, the session was geared toward a diverse student population. In addition to Greek women, USC students from all parts of the campus community attended the Project ReMix.
“Discussing these topics amongst peers allows for topics to be relevant and pertinent to USC student life,” Vela said in an email.
Many associations collaborated to make the event a massive success.
“We truly enjoyed working with the Cultural Center on that initiative and look forward to many more partnerships in the future,” Marwah said.
The event began with a video; “Dear White People,” which depicted many instances of cultural appropriation. The event included a presentation on the definition of cultural appropriation, which can occur in sports mascots, theme parties, clothing and tattoos and the Proactive Campaign. The audience was divided into groups to discuss several topics related to cultural appropriation.
Many students voiced their opinion about the difficulty in drawing a fine line between cultural appreciation and appropriation. A wide range of incidents were quoted, ranging from Halloween costumes to hair appropriation.
“I definitely learned a lot from everyone’s personal perspectives, and I want to work harder at keeping those around me culturally aware in the future,” said Alex Rehberger, a sophomore majoring in stage management.

The fourth day of trial for Javier Bolden who was charged with two counts of murder in the 2012 killings of USC graduate students Ming Qu and Ying Wu, continued at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in downtown Los Angeles Tuesday morning.

During Tuesday’s proceedings, Deputy District Attorney Daniel Akemon first called Stefano Bowe, a subpoenaed representative from TracFone, to the witness stand. TracFone, a wireless phone wholesale retailer, markets phones for use with monthly minute plans. Bowe confirmed that a cellular phone, wiretapped by the Los Angeles Police Department, was purchased by Bolden.
In a wiretap from the night of the crime, a male voice was recorded as saying, “I just killed somebody,” to an unidentified female on the other side of the line.
According to testimony given by LAPD Criminalist Marissa Bowen, cartridge casings found at the scene of the crime were fired from a semi-automatic 9-millimeter Luger pistol that was connected to Bolden, as determined by sheerings from the barrel of the weapon.
Bolden’s attorney, alternate public defender Andrew Goldman, cross-examined Bowen on whether bullets from different guns could have the same sheerings. Bowen said that she believed the sheerings came from the same weapon.
Goldman, who is a USC alumnus, represents low-income clients as part of the alternate public defender’s office, which represents accused persons who are unable to receive legal counsel from the regular public defender’s office due to unavailability or a conflict of interest.
Goldman and Akemon both asked to approach the judge’s bench multiple times throughout the trial for conversations with the judge outside the hearing of the jury.
 
Later, Akemon called Vincent Carrion, another representative from the LAPD, to the stand to testify. Carrion played a DVD for the jury in which a paid undercover informant was placed in the jail cell with Bolden and instructed to befriend him in order to collect details about the crime from inside the jail cell. In the tape, Bolden recounted scenes from the night of the crime with little to no emotion. The informant that spoke to Bolden has been used by the LAPD in many other similar cases.
In the DVD, Bolden revealed details about the crime to the informant and discussed his plans to sell parts from the BMW vehicle for money. He talked at great length about how nice the vehicle was, but did not spend as much time talking about the shootings.
 
He also described seeing the victims’ bodies after they were shot, and consequently fleeing from the scene.
Goldman declined to cross-examine Bowe and Carrion.
Bryan Barnes, the other suspect in the case, pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder in February and is currently serving two life sentences in prison. Both the suspects were charged with the murders in May 2012.
Ming Qu and Ying Wu, the victims, were heading to their home in the early morning of April 11, 2012 when they were both shot and killed while double-parked in a 2003 BMW to the northwest of campus in an apparent robbery attempt.
The trial will continue throughout the week, and according to Judge Stephen Marcus, the jury should reach a decision later this week.

On Tuesday night, members of the Black Student Assembly, Diversity Affairs and the Undergraduate Student Government Senate presented the “Space for Students of Color” resolution,  which aims to create a house or programming space that promotes well-being and success among black students at USC.

Ama Amoafo-Yeboah, executive director of  Program Board, expressed the need for a university-recognized, student-run cultural center for students of color on campus.
“When you’re sitting in class all day and you’re the only black person, it’s important to feel as though you have a space to go back to … where people have had the same experience as you’ve had,” Amafo-Yeboah said.
In a survey of 116 students conducted by USG, 36 percent of black USC students ranked “available social space” as the least satisfying component of their USC experience. “Sense of belonging” was second lowest. Studies suggest a direct correlation between these factors and students’ academic retention rates.
Other universities, including Northwestern, Georgetown, and Stanford University already have social houses for black students. According to the resolution, the planned space would feature 24/7 programming capability and printing, as well as other resources that would contribute to “the success of all students on campus.”
“Having this space won’t negatively affect anyone, it’ll only be a positive for those who currently feel uncomfortable,” Amafo-Yeboah said.
Proponents hope that a house for students of color will make them more academically successful and spark a larger conversation about inequality on campus. While presenting the resolution, Amafo-Yeboah read a statement by a USC student.
“Since I am a student of color, I am not welcomed with open arms into the university,” the anonymous student said in the statement.
Skylar Dunn, co-director of Diversity Affairs, echoed this sentiment. Dunn, who co-authored the resolution, became involved with the project at the request of Amafo-Yeboah.
“I really wanted to make a specific change before I graduate,” Dunn said.
Dunn said he frequently encounters negative assumptions about black students at USC. Among them: that black students are “athletes,” or otherwise different from the rest of the student body.
“It’s one thing to tell people, ‘I go to the University of Southern California,’ and its another thing to feel like you’re a part of it,” Dunn said.
USG Vice President Rini Sampath decided to co-author the project after conversations with students of color on campus opened her eyes to the issue.
“I always knew there were issues on campus, but I never realized the degree to which it impacted students on an individual basis,” Sampath said.
Sampath pointed out that the lack of a social space for black students is at odds with the university’s mission to welcome students of “every race, creed and background.”
Levi Powell, co-director of Diversity Affairs, agreed with Sampath, saying the resolution affects every member of the student body.
“We don’t want this issue to be a reflection of people in this room, but more so a reflection of all of the minds at USC,” Powell said.
The university has approved similar initiatives in the past, such as Somerville Place, an African American-themed dorm on the fifth floor of Fluor Tower. The dorm hosted meetings for African-American clubs on campus until increased security measures made the building inaccessible to non-residents. Powell called the measures “understandable,” but stressed the current lack of social space for black students on campus.
“We’re not even talking about a space that’s ours 24/7, only a space that we can use for a few hours a week. And we don’t even have that,” Powell said.
Authors of the resolution hope that “Space for Students of Color” will have a strong educational component. BSA Executive Director Casey Ellis emphasized the importance of “the home” in African-American culture and its correlation with general success.
“Having our history on the wall as something we can show to prospective and current students is so important to our culture,” Ellis said.
Amafo-Yeboah agreed, and said the house is open to all students who want to learn about black history.
“It’s important to acknowledge the African diaspora, and educate other students who come into the space,” Amafo-Yeboah said.
The authors of the resolution have met with USC professors and administrators to discuss the project. Notable alumni such as Dr. Michelle G. Turner, MBA, Ed.D, executive director of the Black Alumni Association, were also consulted about the project.
Though proponents still have to raise funds for the space, they believe the right support will allow them to move the dialogue forward.
“The money and space are small concerns compared to the support of the administration and student body,” Sampath said.
Though they face many obstacles, proponents of the “Space for Students of Color” resolution believe that they are up to the challenge of solving them.
“This is a stepping stone … It’s about opening up a conversation,” Sampath said.

With midterms underway, there is an increasing amount of stress not only in daily life, but in relationships as well. Unless you are exceptionally fortunate, both your and your partner’s schedules will not match up, and making time to see each other can be nearly impossible.
Helping hand · The stress of working through midterms can be very hazardous to a relationship, but it can be beaten with communication and good planning. If done correctly a relationship can be a boost instead. – Photo illustration by Mariya Dondonyan
Instead of taking out your stress on your significant other, try these helpful hints to get you through those stressful weeks:
There are so many activities going on in college, and it’s tempting to take on as many extracurriculars as possible, though it’s not the smartest idea. It’s not unusual to push reading and homework aside until the last minute in hopes of successfully cramming it all in right before the midterm. The reason professors assign reading every week, however, is so you do not have to read 500 pages in one night about all the different types of bacteria. Knowing how much work you will have to catch up on hangs over your head, and who wants that? Once midterms come around, you may be learning the material for the first time, which creates a perfect storm of stress.
So do yourself and your significant other a favor and read the required material when it’s due during the semester. Then when midterms do come up, you will be able to briefly skim over the readings and your notes, knowing that this material has already been ingrained in your brain. This preparation will help you decrease those last-minute cram sessions so that you can spend more time with your significant other and feel less stressed and more rested. Now you no longer have to set a whole day aside for studying and sacrifice time with your partner -— you can split the time half and half.
If you are a chronic procrastinator and are unable to spread the work out during the semester, don’t worry. Make an effort to communicate your needs so that your boyfriend or girlfriend will know you are in study mode and to respect your space. There is plenty of time to see each other after each of you has taken your tests. Do not let a relationship get in the way of good grades. If your partner loves you enough, they will understand that your education is one of the most important things in your life. Explain to them that it’s not because you don’t desperately want to see them, but rather that seeing them might be too much of a distraction. A person who truly loves you wishes to see you succeed. If they tell you that they are more important than your exams, it may be time to discuss your priorities and if your relationship is going in the right direction.
It is also important to be realistic about your study environment. If you try studying in a place that you realize is not productive, then find a new place to study. Yes, not being able to see your boyfriend or girlfriend for hours or even days sounds like the end of the world to some people, and you may feel obligated to kill two birds with one stone and study together. It’s a great idea in theory, but who really wants to study when the love of your life looks so damn cute sitting next to you? Try to find a quiet comfortable spot with no distractions. Procrastination is easy when there are people or noises to distract you. Distracting study areas not only hurt your studies, but your relationship as well. Many couples take out their frustrations and stress on each other. Do not let unproductive studying get in the way of your happiness.
For those who cannot stand the idea of not seeing their love for more than a few hours, there are ways to be proactive. Everybody needs a study break once in awhile. Go meet up with your significant other at Starbucks and grab a coffee together, but set a time limit. All too easily a 15-minute study break turns into a two-hour adventure.
Keep these study breaks short and sweet, but most of all woth the time. You can do this by discussing the rest of your study plans and how it has been going. Try to stay upbeat when discussing your progress and keep thinking of how great it will feel after the test is done and knowing that you prepared yourself. Accomplishing your work will give you a positive attitude and may just influence the study habits of your partner as well. Your hard work may even impress them.
The most important tip, however, is to enjoy the moments after your exam is over. Stressing out will never help your grade once you have walked out of the classroom. So whether or not you feel you did well, try to unwind with your special someone and enjoy the fact that you are done. There is nothing more relaxing than being with the one person who makes you happy and showing them that you can separate school and downtime.

Victoria Aveyard graduated from the School of Cinematic Art’s BFA screenwriting program in 2012. A year later, she sold a three-book deal to HarperCollins and subsequently the rights to Universal for the first feature film in the series. Her young adult novel Red Queen is about a world where the color of your blood determines your place in society.
Aveyard grew up loving films and constantly writing, but said she never thought the two could be combined. Then, she happened to watch the broadcast of George Lucas receiving his AFI Lifetime Achievement award and learned he went to film school at USC. Aveyard admitted she never knew film school was an option until then, but afterwards went “full throttle [towards] pursuing a film education.”
Once at USC, Aveyard dove headfirst into her program, choosing to dedicate most of her time to her chosen major and writing, rather than picking up any other studies or extracurricular activities along the way. If anything, she said she “minored in internships” but also found time to audit Professor Leonard Maltin’s Film Symposium class twice because “you can’t beat it.”
Yet, Aveyard never thought she’d come out of USC with a novel as her first work. In school she said she only ever thought about screenplays, though she admitted she had fantasies of writing “knock-off” Lord of the Rings when she was young, and cites George R. R. Martin’s A Song of Fire and Ice as a major inspiration in college. But the real encouragement for writing Red Queen came from her literary managers at Benderspink, whom she’d signed with after the writing program’s annual First Pitch event.
Aveyard credits USC with her success.
“I wouldn’t be where I am without SCA,” she said.
Not only did the department connect her with her managers, but it also provided an education where “each course feeds into the other” and gave her the tools to write a novel from everything she had learned in school. Yet, she still faced the scary reality of life after graduation, and the choice she would make immediately following commencement would impact the rest of her life.
The lease was up on her apartment off-campus and Aveyard found herself living on a friend’s couch as she tried to find a job and a new place to live. She realized she couldn’t live and write in Los Angeles’s environment. “I knew I would be a terrible assistant,” Aveyard said. So, she asked her father if she could come home to Massachusetts for a year to work on Red Queen. Aveyard, of course, knew that not every story in Hollywood had a happy ending.
“It was really, really scary,” she said. “I had four years of an education, a lot of college loans and possibly the worst failure of my life riding on this.”
Yet, she returned to the New England countryside and basked in the change of seasons as she attempted to focus on her writing.
“There were weeks where I didn’t get anything down,” she said. “And, weeks where I wrote tens of thousands of words. Being at home was just that security blanket I needed to switch off and focus.”
By January 2013, she had finished her manuscript. By February, she had a literary agent. By April, she had signed a three-book deal with HarperCollins, and three weeks later, Universal Pictures optioned the rights for the novel.
Exactly a year after graduation, Aveyard had more achievements under her belt than she could have ever imagined.
“I thought I was in a coma, hallucinating this turn of events,” she said.
Yet, that wasn’t all for her career. This past February, Aveyard sold her first screenplay (called “Eternal”) to Sony Pictures. “It’s nice to know I’m not a one-hit wonder,” Aveyard confessed. Currently, she’s finishing the first draft of the second installment of the Red Queen series, as well as outlining the third novel and working with a couple ideas for both television and film.
Aveyard advised aspiring filmmakers and writers to learn about themselves.
“Know your limits. I know how much I can handle and how much I can’t. It’s not a weak thing, it’s powerful.”
Also, Aveyard advised that everyone should keep in touch with pop culture.
“Go see popular television. See what’s working. You can marathon foreign films all you want, but that’s not going to help you write something sellable,” she said.
Though she’s come a long way, Aveyard has not left her USC roots behind.
“I still try to get to as many [football] games as possible, or at least the tailgate,” she said. “My team and I are gearing up for the release of Red Queen on Feb. 10, [so I’m] hoping to be at Festival of Books, mainly so I have a reason to go to Traddies.”

Rock ‘n’ roll is alive and well. Well, indie rock at least, and it comes in the form of Utah-based group Desert Noises. It is as if the grandchildren of Bob Dylan and Jimmy Page met in a skate park and decided to start a band. Their newest album, 27 Ways, came out earlier this year and the band have been up-and-coming ever since.

The band will be returning to Los Angeles on Oct. 29 to perform at the El Rey Theatre, but they are by no means new to the scene. According to lead singer Kyle Henderson, despite being based in Utah, they have performed in Los Angeles upwards of 10 times.
Henderson, lead guitarist Patrick Boyer, bassist Tyler Osmond and drummer Brennan Allen come together to combine the best parts of the indie, rock and folk worlds in a throwback to when music was simpler. Desert Noises’ second album chronicles their transition from growing up in Utah to touring the country and the experiences that came with it.
It’s clear as he speaks that Henderson stakes no claim in seeking attention or wanting fame — his laid-back manner and soft tone stand to emphasize the simplicity of the band itself. When asked about his favorite track on the album, Henderson was reluctant to pick just one.
“Each one of those songs was really personal, you know, and they mean so much to me,” Henderson said.
The original lineup consisted of Henderson, his brother and a friend. After his brother and their friend left, Boyer and Osmond stepped in and were eventually joined by Allen. Henderson cites their greatest difference from when they released their first album to now is that the band members have settled into their lineup. He explained that their first album saw them still figuring out their dynamic and how they could work together. And while their debut album Mountain Sea showcased their potential, by 27 Ways it is clear the band has come into their own.
Henderson had stopped touring, gone back to school and eventually gotten what he described as “a normal job,” but found that the monotony gave him anxiety.
“I just felt I wasn’t being myself,” he said. Henderson explained that the decision to return to music is what lies at the core of the album.
“What we want [the listeners] to take from [the album] is the joy that we get from doing what was a hard decision, a life-changing decision and we’re kind of hoping it inspires them to do the same,” Henderson said.
27 Ways is an album that carries a personal touch often lost in today’s music industry. Though each song feels as if it was made by the band for the band, there is inspiration to be found in how relatable each song is for the audience. It does not matter that the songs are written about very personal experiences — there’s a universality to each one that allows the listener to understand and relate. The music itself is rooted in alternative rock but branches out into a multitude of genres. From soft whispers of a banjo to the howling of electric guitars, Desert Noises combines recognizable vocals with a different vibe for each song. With the differences in tracks, they still manage to keep the sound clean.
Every component of each song is simple but when intertwined, they create a sound that hits the listener from all directions in the best possible way. The lyrics only add to this overwhelming simplicity. Henderson pens songs that sound heartfelt and raw. By avoiding the overly poetic metaphors and cliché romanticisms, the songs carry more weight and pack a greater punch that is only heightened by the honesty with which they describe the band members’ personal evolutions.
Henderson described how they each have different inspirations that allow for a wealth of variety for all aspects of their band. Apart from the classics of Led Zeppelin and the Eagles, each band member comes with their own musical influences. Henderson himself credited Modest Mouse as being especially influential to him.
As for their live shows, their influence and energy comes from the audience. Henderson said of concerts, “[they] want people to have fun.” The band is known for energetic live shows, and the guys make a point of making each show different. Henderson is especially excited to be playing in Los Angeles again, noting that his favorite thing to do at L.A. shows is tell the audience to smile more.
Desert Noises is currently on tour with The Wild Feathers and The Apache Relay. They will be touring the rest of the year, stopping only to take a break in the winter before beginning again in February. If their music is not enough to intrigue you, then perhaps their hairstyles will compel you to come and see them live.

Koreatown’s impressive hustle and bustle doesn’t stop for much — one of the busiest sectors of Los Angeles is full of people, lights and activity at all hours. But perched in the middle of the flurry is a small greenhouse full of plants and good food. This greenhouse is home to Commissary, the Line Hotel’s new restaurant that sits on a rooftop above the city offering a peaceful foodie’s escape.
Surprising kick · Chef Roy Choi’s inventive take on vegetables are a hit — the carrot dish (pictured) consists of a few expertly grilled carrots topped with a pesto-like sauce with an unexpected bite. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Commissary’s atmosphere immediately attracts anyone looking for a quirky but beautiful setting. The greenhouse, filled with hanging planters and soft lights, screams hipster and offers a trendy but serene ambience. After entering through the hotel and taking the elevator to the second floor, guests find themselves outside the door of Commissary — greeted by the cool air as they pass the outdoor dining area complete with umbrellas and tiny, intimate tables, patrons continue into the actual greenhouse, where they are immediately surrounded by the warm, inviting milieu.
The perfectly hip music paired with the softness of the recessed lighting culminate to create a well-balanced, comfortable atmosphere, and the plants add a recherché twist to create a cozy but unique dining space.
The waitstaff is relaxed and kind, many of whom make an effort to have personal conversations with their respective tables and answer questions about the vague menu. The service is also especially quick, including that from the kitchen.
Commissary also goes out of its way to add almost-whimsical touches in unexpected ways. The water glasses and funky napkin rings are all mismatched, and each table gets a packet of seeds. Commissary’s unique menu has pictures — only pictures. The small paper menus are presented in an airmail envelope (see: “screams hipster”) and come with a disclaimer from the chef:
“Welcome to COMMISSARY. There are no description words. I know, I know. Don’t freak out. Trust the pictures. And choose your own adventure. This is the experience. Point and build. And have a great time. — Chef Roy.”
Each picture is of one food type and has one descriptive word — “eggs,” for example, or “lettuce” — forcing each diner to truly “choose their own adventure.” The dishes are fairly small but reasonably priced, and what they lack in quantity, they make up for in quality and complexity of flavor.
The “carrot” dish consists of a variety of types of carrots, grilled to juicy perfection. They are topped with a creamy, pesto-like sauce with an unexpected bite and fresh sprouts. Bursting with flavor, the dish is peculiar and delicious.
The grilled cheese is grilled to slightly crispy perfection — the cheese soft and gooey between two thick slices of good bread with slightly crispy edges — and served with a creamy tomato sauce. The sauce, somewhere between a ketchup and a soup, perfectly complements the sandwich. The dish as a whole, though, is nothing particularly special in terms of flavor or quality.
The fig dish is also small but again makes up for its size by being packed full of flavor. The sweet, fresh figs are balanced by onions and goat cheese and topped with crisp greens and a light, flavorful sauce.
The brown rice and French fries are two of the only four side dishes offered at Commissary and are unfortunately bland. The rice is dry and lacks flavor and the French fries, though well cooked and not greasy, are nothing special.
Commissary’s website boasts its focus on fresh fruit and vegetables. The restaurant is described as one that pays “a homage to all the people and families here in So Cal that work on farms to bring food to our tables.”
The idea of fruit and vegetables as the heart of the restaurant is apparent — the dishes containing fresh produce are more artfully prepared and contain extraordinary flavor — but Commissary comes up a bit short with its bland versions of basic dishes.
Overall, the food, though good, isn’t what makes Commissary memorable. The greenhouse is home to a rare oasis amid Los Angeles’ commotion and provides a romantic escape from the busy city. Its perfect rustic-chic decoration and balanced trendy-cozy ambience meld to create a fun, intimate and very unique restaurant.
Commissary is now open for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. at the Line Hotel, 3515 Wilshire Boulevard.

After winning three games in a four-game home stand, the USC women’s volleyball team will head to the Bay Area to take on two Pac-12 rivals. On Oct. 22, the Women of Troy will face off with the California Bears (8-10, 0-8 Pac-12) in Berkeley. Four days later, the Women of Troy will face arguably their toughest opponent this season, the No. 1 Stanford Cardinal (18-0, 8-0 Pac-12).
Voltage spike · Junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio, who leads the team with 339.5 points this season, says USC needs to up its energy. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
Despite just an 11-7 record and a 4-4 mark in conference play, the Women of Troy are still ranked No. 19 in the AVCA Coaches Poll, and the Women of Troy have beaten every opponent they’ve faced that currently is not in the Top 25. But besides Kentucky, the Women of Troy have failed to win a single match against an opponent who is currently ranked. In all seven losses for the Women of Troy this season combined, the Women of Troy have been outscored 21 sets to five sets.
A possible good omen, though, is that USC has been better on the road this season than at home. The Women of Troy are below a .500 winning percentage on their home floor with a 3-5 record, but they have been successful in games away from the Galen Center with a 0.800 winning percentage (8-2) in away or neutral games, so the fact that the Bears are unranked and the Women of Troy are playing on the road could be a winning situation for the Women of Troy.
But the much bigger test will be against No. 1 Stanford, a team that is undefeated this season. The Cardinal have been stellar at winning sets, losing only 12 so far this season in 18 matches. A key factor for the Women of Troy for this match — and every remaining match this season — will be their ability to close out sets. In their last three losses combined, the Women of Troy have lost five sets by five points or less.
The Women of Troy have several powerhouse players that will have to be on their game for the USC to sweep its Northern California visit.
Junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio continues to lead the way for the Women of Troy with her explosive offense. She leads the team with 261 kills and an impressive 60 service aces. Sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu and freshman outside hitter Lauryn Gillis have also produced kill numbers well into the triple digits and have combined for 16 service aces.
Senior setter Hayley Crone and sophomore setter Alice Pizzasegola have set their teammates up well this season, combining for 693 assists.
Defensively, sophomore libero Taylor Whittingham and junior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms have been stellar this season. Whittingham has recorded a team-high 265 digs, and Ogoms has been strong at the net, tallying a team-best 58 blocks.
The Cal Bears will bring their best players in an attempt to upset the Women of Troy. Outside hitter/opposite hitter Christina Higgins leads the Bears with 247 kills, and middle blocker Lillian Schonewise is second on her team in kills and tied for second in service aces with 10.
Outside hitters Ashten Smith-Gooden and Christine Alftin have also produced triple digit kill numbers for the Bears. On defense, libero Maddy Kerr has been impressive, tallying 287 digs for her team. In fact, Kerr’s 287 digs is more than double that of defensive specialist Sarah Cole’s 131 digs, which rank second on the Bears. Schonewise has been a factor defensively as well, leading her team in blocks with 73.
USC head coach Mick Haley thinks Cal is a perplexing opponent that is still trying to find its identity.
“Cal is a work in progress,” Haley said. “I just want to get in there and out of there before they figure it out. They always play well at home.”
Unlike in the game against Cal, the Women of Troy are the underdogs against Stanford. To pull off a major upset against the Cardinal, the Women of Troy will have to focus their efforts on some of the nation’s top players.
The Cardinal boast five players with triple digit kill numbers, with middle blocker Inky Ajanaku’s 225 kills leading the way. Ajanaku also leads her team with 79 blocks.
On defense, five players are in the triple digits in the digs column, led by libero/defensive specialist Kyle Gilbert’s 299.
Outside hitter Jordan Burgess, opposite hitter Morgan Boukather and outside hitter Brittany Howard have been the best overall players on the Cardinal, with each recording a triple digit number of both kills and digs.
Haley remains optimistic that his team will put up a good fight against the nation’s No. 1 team, since USC pulled out a tough 3-2 win in Palo Alto last season after sweeping the Cardinal in the Galen Center earlier that season. Still, USC’s 14th-year head coach knows that knocking off the nation’s top team will be a tough task.
“Stanford is 18-0,” Haley said. “But it is the same team we beat twice last year. They’ve been together now for two and a half to three years. I think their systems are a little bit better. We’ll have a match on our hands for sure.”
Pizzasegola feels her team can beat Stanford, and her formula is simple.
“I think we just need to play volleyball,” Pizzasegola said.. “When we are confident and when we are free to play volleyball, I think we are so good. And we have to be smart. Last year, we won because we served really good.”
Bricio believes her team’s energy will be a key factor on the road trip.
“We are having a little bit of trouble energy-wise,” Bricio said. “We have to keep the energy all the time and we have to be focused all the time. When we are doing those two things, we play really well.”

Reading quiz!
Of the following conferences and divisions, which has the most teams in the AP Top 25?
A. The SEC West
B. The Pac-12 South
C. The Big 12
D. The ACC and Big Ten combined
E. All of the above
If you guessed E, then congratulations, you’re correct! As a prize, you can keep this copy of the Daily Trojan for free.
Yes, you read that right. The Pac-12 South has as many teams in the Top 25 as the almighty SEC West. Sure, the SEC West’s poll presence is a little more top-heavy — No. 1 Mississippi State, No. 3 Ole Miss, No. 4 Alabama, No. 5 Auburn and No. 24 LSU — than the Pac-12 South’s — No. 14 Arizona State, No. 15 Arizona, No. 19 Utah, No. 20 USC and No. 25 UCLA — but both have five represented in the AP Poll (sorry Arkansas and Colorado).
Of all the numbers I could point to after last week’s 56-28 win over the Buffaloes, from redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler’s record seven touchdowns to Colorado’s rank of 121st out of 124 Division 1-A football teams for scoring defense, the number that sticks out most is that number five.
Fellow Daily Trojan columnist Jake Davidson wrote Monday that the media gives way too much credit to the SEC and not enough to the Pac-12. I don’t buy into the “SEC Media Bias” idea as much as he does; I think the SEC really is that good. But I totally agree that the Pac-12 is at least the next best thing, and I really hope the Bowl Selection Committee feels the same way at the end of the season.
The Big 12 has the same number of representatives in the AP Poll as the Pac-12 South — No. 10 TCU, No. 11 Kansas State, No. 12 Baylor, No. 17 Oklahoma and No. 22 West Virginia — but not nearly the same depth with 10 teams in the conference. The Big Ten has 14 teams that could crack the Top 25, but only three did — No. 8 Michigan State, No. 13 Ohio State and No. 16 Nebraska. Yes, the Big 12 has 10 teams and the Big Ten has 14 teams, because real institutions of higher learning challenge the basic assumptions of mathematics. The ACC also has 14 teams, but only two representatives — No. 2 Florida State and No. 21 Clemson.
Oregon is currently the only ranked team out of the Pac-12 North, coming in at No. 6. Though the Pac-12 North’s lack of depth may undermine the South’s dominance a little, the fact that the South winner will more than likely face the Ducks in the Pac-12 title game further reinforces how good a team has to be to come out of the South half and win the conference championship.
And with that, time for this week’s edition of “Absurdly Ridiculous Scenario in which a Two-Loss USC Team Still Makes the Playoff.”
Last week, I laid out the most plausible chain reaction of USC victories and Top 25 upsets I could think of that would leave the Trojans in the Top 4 at the end of the year. It was so ridiculous that Los Angeles Times columnist Chris Dufresne quoted it in his Saturday column.
Well, my hopeful predictions didn’t really go as planned. In fact, I based the entire scenario on Notre Dame beating Florida State to maximize USC’s strength of schedule, and sure enough, the Irish fell to the Seminoles on a controversial last play.
So USC’s playoff hopes are over?
Nope! Somebody turn up the John Denver, because West Virginia is coming to take us home to the place we belong!
My miracle scenario assumed then-No. 4 Baylor would go undefeated and claim a playoff spot. The West Virginia Mountaineers had other plans and upset the Bears 41-27. So while Florida State remained the undefeated leader out of the ACC and SEC juggernauts Mississippi State and Ole Miss stayed perfect, the Big 12 no longer has an undefeated leader poised to take a playoff spot.
My new best guess is that two SEC teams and Florida State will claim the first three seeds. That leaves the fourth spot open for either the Big Ten, Big 12 or Pac-12 winner. If USC runs the table, a Big Ten or Big 12 winner will almost certainly rank ahead of USC with one loss but almost certainly rank behind with two losses. This also assumes a third SEC team — God forbid — won’t make the playoff. But non-qualifiers out from there would probably need three losses to fall behind USC, especially after Notre Dame’s loss.
So this is still really, really complicated. Basically, Michigan, Texas and LSU all need to wreak havoc in their respective conferences, and USC still needs to go undefeated.
What is in some ways USC’s best hope — the strength of the team’s schedule — is also USC’s biggest obstacle. The Trojans looked great against Colorado, but the Buffaloes are worlds behind the rest of the Pac-12 South. USC is an even .500 against ranked Pac-12 South teams, with a last-play loss against Arizona State and a last-play win against Arizona. With the parity in the conference, that seems like a perfectly fair result halfway through, and a pretty accurate prediction of what’s to come the rest of the way.
USC still has to visit Utah and UCLA. The Trojans will probably win one of those games and probably lose the other. The result will probably be an absurdly confusing tiebreaker for the Pac-12 South championship, and that’s just for the right to play Oregon. The Trojans hail from a conference so aptly characterized by depth, and yet depth is the ultimate Achilles’ heel for the team as it continues to deal with the hangover of NCAA sanctions.
So the mountain to climb is still pretty steep — literally, considering the Trojans play at high altitude this weekend in Utah and depth will be tested even more. But inexplicability is the norm in college football today, and there’s plenty more craziness to come this season. I’m really grateful USC came through with the non-stressful blowout I asked for last weekend, but I’m ready to dive back into the chaos this Saturday at Utah.

USC looks to stay atop the Pac-12 South and move up from its new No. 20 ranking when the squad heads to the mountains and clashes with the Utah Utes, who are only ranked one slot higher than the Trojans at No. 19.
Rush hour · Redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen leads the Pac-12 with 909 rushing yards this season. The Tallahassee, Florida, native will be going up against the No. 2 rush defense in the Pac-12 at Utah. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Injury Report
Though there were many Trojans who weren’t up to full speed at Tuesday’s practice, all the players are expected to be game-ready by Saturday.
Senior linebacker Hayes Pullard, who suffered a knee scare during the Colorado game but was back in just a few plays later to make a touchdown-saving play, was limited to the exercise bike Tuesday.
Senior safety Gerald Bowman was also limited to the exercise bike. Redshirt junior wide receiver George Farmer participated in practice. Redshirt junior fullback Soma Vainuku’s hamstring injury kept him out of practice.
Showdown in the South
The Trojans will travel to Utah on Saturday to mix it up with the No. 19 ranked Utah Utes. Utah is tied for third in the Pac-12 South, where five of the six teams are ranked in the AP Poll. The Trojans still sit atop the division at 4-1 and 5-2 overall, but it is clear that Utah is a must-win.
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian did not want to underestimate Utah, but also did not want to overemphasize this game over others the Trojans have played, despite it being a clash between two ranked teams in the same division.
“We have to treat it just like the other ones,” he said. “It’s a valuable one and we need to understand the environment we are heading into.”
Redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen says the team is focused heading into the new week and expecting Utah to come after them.
“USC is always going to have a target on their back,” Allen said. “[Utah’s] home, and it’s going to be a tough game.”
Utah has been alternating between two quarterbacks all season, but on Tuesday Utes head coach Kyle Whittingham announced that Travis Wilson will start against the Trojans. Wilson has thrown for 833 yards and seven touchdowns this season.
The Utah defense has long been thought of as the biggest challenge the Trojans will face this season, as they currently lead the Pac-12 in sacks.
Sarkisian cited two specific aspects of the game the offensive line could potentially struggle with: an all-around talented opponent and the crowd noise from a hostile environment.
“The best way to prepare is to go out and execute at a high level,” Sarkisian said. “We need to be prepared for the physicality [of Utah].”
It’s History Now

Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler made history Saturday when he threw seven touchdown passes, the most ever by a USC quarterback in a single game (one more than former Trojan quarterback Matt Barkley threw four times). Because of his performance, Kessler also brought home the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week award.
“I would love to do that every week,” Kessler said. “It’s all preparation, and I’m going into each game trying to play my best.”
Kessler drew considerable praise from Sarkisian, who sees Kessler as a fantastic teammate and leader who demonstrates a workmanlike attitude at practice every day.
“There’s still stuff I could improve on,” Kessler said. “I approach every game as a new game and prepare the same way I prepare for every game.”

Last Tuesday, the Boston Globe published an op-ed from 28 professors at Harvard Law School who are asking the university to abandon a sexual misconduct policy introduced in July. When the policy was announced, Harvard President Drew Faust stated, “Harvard is deeply committed to fostering an educational environment free of gender-based discrimination, particularly sexual misconduct and sexual violence.” Though well-intentioned, the change promotes the cultivation of an environment where men are made to fear the consequences for crimes they might not have committed, or punishments that are harsher than the crime warrants.
Harvard is not alone in the struggle. Eighty-five schools across the country are currently undergoing scrutiny for violating Title IX, USC included. In an effort to cover their backs and maintain their government funding, many schools have ignored the principles our country’s courts were founded on and perpetuated an oppressive view of female sexuality to quickly reform their policies.
To be fair, they got some things right. Harvard’s new office, run by specially trained civil rights investigators, will look into all complaints of gender-based discrimination, not just criminal offenses like rape.
Even with a panel of trained specialists, however, Harvard is not equipped to handle rape cases. None of the 85 schools are. The policies that have brought them under scrutiny are just a symptom of the problem. According to the Huffington Post, one Dept. of Public Safety officer at USC said that women should not “go out, get drunk and expect not to get raped.” After decades of treating rape as a women’s issue, ignoring claims, telling students they were not actually raped and blaming victims for their outfits or alcohol consumption, these universities have proven they lack the judgment to handle these cases in a fair and responsible manner.
Now, things have shifted. Finally called out for their misconduct, universities have scapegoated their male students with harsher policies, but have still set consequences that are ineffective at preventing repeat offenses.
In response to Harvard’s new policy, law professors from the university critiqued the lack of adequate representation for the accused. They added that Harvard’s definition of sexual misconduct is harsher than the one mandated by Title IX.
The most common punishment for rape through the U.S. courts today is imprisonment. Universities do not have the right to imprison students. Instead, they suspend or expel students. At USC, if students are members of a Greek organization, they remove charters or place the chapter on suspension. Expulsion might protect university students from a repeat offender, but that leaves a rapist free to roam the streets and does not protect the rest of the non-university students.
There is one final issue with sexual assault policies at universities, including USC. In an effort to avoid the victim-blaming exhibited by DPS’s comment that women who get drunk should expect to be raped, USC’s sexual assault policy states that consent cannot be given while the victim is intoxicated. The policy includes no gender description. It later states intoxication of the accused does not diminish their responsibility. So if two drunk people have sex, the first to accuse the other of rape becomes the victim and the other becomes the accused. When intoxicated, you cannot legally give consent, but you must have the judgment to know the other person’s consent does not count. With a policy that has been reinforced by California’s “yes means yes” law, all drunk college hookups are rape. At USC, where tailgates on campus and registered university parties have alcohol, intoxicated sex is common. By including this in their sexual assault policies, universities are either ignorant about students’ behavior or intentionally ignoring college drunk hookup culture to keep funding and be compliant.
The job of universities is to educate students. An effective sexual assault policy for USC would educate students on the definition and consequences of rape according to the U.S. government, but turn over all cases to LAPD to be investigated by law enforcement professionals.

For anyone who knows anything about tennis, Serena and Venus Williams stand out for their intense and incredible skills on the court. Despite this, in a recent television program, the president of the Russian Tennis Federation, Shamil Tarpischev, called the Williams sisters the “Williams brothers” and said that “it’s scary when you really look at them,” according to Time magazine. By insinuating that muscular, athletic females are inherently masculine, Tarpischev demonstrated utmost sexism, harsh discrimination that has no place in the world of sports.

Fortunately, action was taken against Tarpischev for his comments. According to Time, the Women’s Tennis Association suspended Tarpishev for a year and fined him $25,000. This was a momentous decision, since he has a large sphere of influence in the world of tennis. Bringing such comments to the athletic world was clearly inappropriate, so punishing someone of his caliber in sports demonstrated that there is no tolerance for sexism or, as the Williams sisters also believe, racism. Serena agreed that this was the best decision on the part of Women’s Tennis Association. According to CNN, Serena said, “The WTA and the USTA [United States Tennis Association] did a wonderful job of making sure that — in this day of age, 2014 for someone with his power, it’s really unacceptable to make such bullying remarks.”
Despite the consequences he has had to accept for his actions, Tapischev still expressed no remorse for his hurtful words. According to the Daily Mail, Tarpischev felt that the quotes were taken out of context. “I didn’t want to offend any athlete with my words,” he said. “I regret that this joke … has garnered so much attention. I don’t think this incident deserves so much fuss.” Note that he didn’t say that he regretted the “joke,” but that he regretted it garnering so much attention. The fact that Tarpischev, an authority figure in sports, doesn’t understand why it was offensive underscores the need to continue battling against sexist mindsets that have become so culturally ingrained. For years, women and minorities have fought for their place in sports, and to make light of women like the Williams sisters, who are champions of their sport, reflects a mindset that still needs correcting. The fact that talented women are ridiculed for their muscular definition instead of the beautiful strength they possess is baffling, especially in this day and age with the feminist movement on the rise. Comments like this, if gone unchecked, could send the wrong message to younger generations.
Though Tarpischev’s comments were beliefs that he is entitled to, sharing them for the sole purpose of humor or malicious intent — no matter which — was disrespectful and misguided. In the past, sexist comments about various female athletes have been a problem in the struggle for gender equality in sports. According to the 2012 Body Issue of ESPN Magazine, Olympian Carmelita Jeter was asked which body part she liked to work out for aesthetic purposes, and she replied, “I’m not here to look cute. I’m here to be powerful, be aggressive, to be a force.” British Olympic weightlifter Zoe Smith dealt with a similar situation. When a documentary about her and her team was aired on television, misogynistic men began to post sexist comments on Twitter, saying that she was not being “feminine enough,” or insulting statements such as, “Now piss off back to the kitchen and make your boyfriend a sandwich, he’s hungry.” While they were not publicly protected against such sexist slander like the Williams sisters were, both spoke out against experiences with bullying. Smith said that she gave them a “verbal kicking they deserved” on a blog she wrote. Her ability to fight against the sexist slander thrown her way helped continue to pave the way towards the defense of women suffering in some misogynistic sports environments.
Though Tarpischev did attempt to soften his blow by saying the Williams sisters were “outstanding athletes [who] personify strength and perseverance,” the damage had already been done on his part. It is fortunate that some athletic associations have no problem reprimanding anyone for racist or sexist comments that have no place on the court.
