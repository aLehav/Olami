Three internationally known scholars of Judaism, Catholicism and Islam came together for “World Religions — Finding Common Ground,” an event hosted by the USC Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study on Wednesday evening. 
Panelists included Amir Hussain, a Canadian Muslim and professor of theological studies at Loyola Marymount University; Pim Valkenberg, specialist in Christian-Muslim dialogue and professor of religion and culture in the School of Theology and Religious Studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.; and Rabbi Reuven Firestone, regenstein professor in Medieval Judaism and Islam at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles and faculty member of the School of Religion and the Middle East Studies Center at USC. Varun Soni, dean of the Office of Religious Life, moderated the panel.
All three panelists are scholars-in-residence for the fall 2016 semester through a research program jointly sponsored by the USC Caruso Catholic Center and the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies at USC. Wednesday’s discussion was the first of several conversations occurring throughout the semester, centered on the theme “Race, Faith, & Violence: Learning from Three Religions.”
James Heft, USC’s Alton M. Brooks professor of religion, introduced the event by emphasizing the importance of interfaith engagement. 
“It is important to realize that our country talks about toleration, and that’s a good alternative to violence, but it doesn’t build friendship. Instead of just toleration, what you really want and [what] this evening is about is engagement — respectful, informed engagement,” he said. 
Amir Hussain also stressed the importance of interfaith understanding, specifically for reducing conflict.
“[It is key that] we know each other’s stories. Because like it or not, we are in each other’s lives and need to deal with each other, from a roommate-level conflict to much greater conflicts,” Hussain said.
Much of the discussion centered on a challenge all three religions have in common: engaging young people. According to the Pew Research Center, the number of religiously unaffiliated Americans has grown rapidly in recent years, from 36.6 million in 2007 to 55.8 million in 2014. This unaffiliated segment skews towards millennials, with 35 percent of those born between 1981 and 1996 considering themselves unidentified. At USC, two-thirds of students consider themselves to be more spiritual than religious, according to Dean Soni.
“There is always constant tension between tradition and innovation, between the ancient and sacred and something more relevant, with things moving so much more quickly today,” Firestone said. “I think all three of our religions have failed to do a good job of translating the aspects of our traditions into ways that are relevant in the modern age.” 
However, Valkenberg noted that the growing number of young people who don’t identify with a religion could be a good thing, if it means they are taking their time to develop their religion. 
“I think that it’s a good thing as a student that you can look around and just develop, and I’m coming from the Netherlands, where ‘none,’ is the dominant religion,” he said.
The three scholars will participate in events for the “Race, Faith, and Violence” series throughout the semester. The official kick-off event for the series, “The Great Divide: Faith and Politics in America Today,” is scheduled for Sept. 8. 
Such misinformed silliness.  Why can’t we just acknowledge all religions are quite different.
Buddhism is quite different than Hinduism – the religion it evolved from.  
Christianity is quite different than Judaism – the religion it evolved from.
And Islam is different too.  For instance, Islam’s prophet is considered the perfect example of a man who all Muslims should emulate.  This is not different than the other religions mentioned, but what is VERY different is that Mohammed was a violent, aggressive sadist who led more than 60 battles, who married 11 different women, who enslaved others, who took sex slaves, who ordered his men to kill and main others, who preached the superiority of Muslims to all other people, who preached that Islam should rule the caliphate – the entire world – and that those who refuse to convert to Islam be killed or forced into second-class status subject o crushing taxes.
Why do supposed “experts” not even acknowledge these facts when pretending to teach us about religions?
The link, gentlemen, is credulousness…

eHarmony, a dating website, has recruited two researchers from the USC Information Sciences Institute to shorten the matchmaking process for its users.
Aram Galstyan, a research director for data science and machine learning at the Information Sciences Institute, and Greg Ver Steeg, a research assistant professor, are applying quantum mechanics to the eHarmony algorithm that assess personality traits and psychological qualities. 
Consistent with eHarmony’s slogan, “#1 Trusted Dating Site for Like-Minded Singles,” the dating network matches users with compatible individuals through an algorithm. Upon creation of an account, the dating network prompts the users with a series of questions about their personalities and relationship preferences. The information gathered from this diagnostic is then used to build the user’s profile. eHarmony uses the completed profile to find psychologically harmonious matches, which show up in the user’s email the morning after.
eHarmony has decreased their survey from 500 questions to 145 questions, but Galstyan and Ver Steeg hope to get the number even lower in the future.
“The ultimate goal of our research is to develop efficient computational tools extracting useful knowledge from very high-dimensional, complex data,” Galstyan said. “Specifically, we assume that regularities in such data are often described by a small set of hidden factors, so our objective is to infer those factors. When applied to behavioral data such as psychological questionnaires, those factors describe things like personality types.”
According to eHarmony’s “Married Couples by the Numbers” report, 71 percent of female users and 69 percent of male users find their future spouse on eHarmony within a year of creating a profile. Five percent of marriages in the United States started as relationships through eHarmony. The divorce rate for these marriages is 3.86 percent while the national average is about 50 percent, according to the American Psychological Association. This is largely due to the preliminary questionnaire presented to the user. It acts as a curator, finding the right match for each user.
However, at 500 questions long, many users dislike the length of the questionnaire. 
“A lot of people give up before they make it through the whole list,” Ver Steeg said. “For eHarmony, it means they lose a lot of customers. The question is how to find the best trade-off. What is the smallest set of questions that will identify a good set of potential partners?”
Cutting certain questions can risk omitting some of the user’s information that is necessary to successfully find a potentially long-lasting partner. This chance proved that there must be a shorter and more direct method to find the right partner while still upholding the comprehensiveness and success of the questionnaire.
Galstyan and Ver Steeg have produced a simplification through a process called Total Correlation Explanation, or CorEx. 
“The ‘explanation’ is to find some hidden factor that would explain how all these relationships came about,” Ver Steeg said. “For instance, if you saw that the days your friends carry an umbrella to class are very correlated, you could posit a hidden factor, in this case ‘rain,’ that explains all the correlations you observed. A similar thing happens for questionnaires and surveys. How you respond to the question of how much you enjoy parties is correlated to how well you can strike up conversations. The ‘hidden factor’ that seems to explain your answers to these questions is usually called extroversion.”
A previous version of this article stated that Galstyan and Ver Steeg were responsible for the reduction in eHarmony’s survey questions from 500 to 145. They were not part of this reduction process. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
Please be alerted eHarmony is a 16  years old obsolete site and a HOAX, based on a big scientific fraud, only sustained by big marketing budget.
The Big Five normative test used by eHarmony, had been proven/revealed as an incomplete and incorrect model to assess/measure personality of persons.
Moreover eHarmony was copycatted in several countries like the online dating sites EliteSingles in Canada, Australia, USA, UK; eDarling in Spain, German, France, Russia; also TeAmo in Russia is another copycat of eHarmony. eSynchrony in Singapore, MiMediaManzana in Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Chile, etc.
BIG DATA DATING is not the key to long-lasting romance.
COMPATIBILITY is: STRICT PERSONALITY SIMILARITY and not “meet other people with similar interests”.  
WorldWide, there are over 5,000 -five thousand- online dating sites
but no one is using the 16PF5 (or similar) to assess personality of its members!
but no one calculates similarity with a quantized pattern comparison method!
but no one can show Compatibility Distribution Curves to each and every of its members!
but no one is scientifically proven!  No actual online dating site  is “scientifically proven” because no one can prove its matching algorithm can match prospective partners who will have more stable and satisfying relationships -and very low divorce rates- than couples matched by chance, astrological destiny, personal preferences, searching on one’s own, or other technique as the control group in a peer reviewed Scientific Paper for the majority (over 90%) of its members.
but no one can show you a list of compatible persons like this:
( for a prospective male customer / sample but calculated with real values)
“Over 1,000,000 million women database, here is the list of the 12 more compatible with you. Notice that woman#1 is the most compatible with you but she could be more compatible with other men right now.
woman#01 is 95.58476277% compatible
woman#02 is 95.56224356% compatible
woman#03 is 95.52998273% compatible
woman#04 is 94.18354278% compatible
woman#05 is 93.00453871% compatible
woman#06 is 93.00007524% compatible
woman#07 is 92.99738452% compatible
woman#08 is 92.37945551% compatible
woman#09 is 92.29779173% compatible
woman#10 is 92.27114287% compatible
woman#11 is 92.19515551% compatible
woman#12 is 92.12249558% compatible”
The only way to revolutionize the Online Dating Industry is using the 16PF5 normative personality test, available in different languages to assess personality of members, or a proprietary test with exactly the same traits of the 16PF5 and expressing compatibility with eight decimals (needs a quantized pattern comparison method, part of pattern recognition by cross-correlation, to calculate similarity between prospective mates.)
High precision in matching algorithms is precisely the key to open the door and leave the infancy of compatibility testing.
Without offering the NORMATIVE 16PF5 (or similar test measuring exactly the 16 personality factors) for serious dating, it will be impossible to innovate and revolutionize the Online Dating Industry
The Online Dating Industry does not need a 10% improvement, a 50% improvement or a 100% improvement. It does need “a 100 times better improvement”
All other proposals are NOISE and perform as placebo.

Two USC students have founded a nonprofit organization designed to help those in the USC community monitor their wellness and build healthy habits. 
Ignite, created by seniors Catalina and Trevor Gutiérrez, is a technology platform in which USC students  can track their fitness, share their fitness goals and achievements with friends and learn more about maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It includes a mobile application, an online blog, a social media presence and an online merchandise store. 
The core Ignite team consists of 21 members, including 10 students, the Gutierrez siblings’ father and 10 faculty advisors. The app is projected to consist of a social media platform, a metrics system accessible with tracking sensors such as Fitbit, Apple Watch and a cloud-based goal-tracking system, among other features. 
“Our goal is to connect USC students through Ignite to promote healthier lifestyles all around,” Catalina Gutiérrez said. “Our empirical research shows that social media can boost behavior change, and we want to use that to foster a more active student body.”
Ignite is a venture formed off the backbone of the Gutiérrez siblings’ previous project, the Go Green Foundation.
“After working on global preservation and sustainability with the Go Green Foundation, we decided to pivot our focus on more health-related issues,” Catalina Gutierrez said. “What we found was that only 6 percent of all adults act upon their physicians’ recommendations to maintain their health, and that is a huge crisis. That is why we decided to create Ignite, to use behavior-change science to encourage more adults to take daily action towards improving their health.” 
Ana-Catalina Triana, the associate program director at John Muir Health and one of the project’s advisers, said part of Ignite’s appeal is the fact that its design and content is catered specifically to millennials.
“As a family physician and behaviorist, I am thrilled to participate in such groundbreaking work that has the potential to make a large-scale positive impact in the quality of life for young adults worldwide,” Triana said. 
Ignite’s mobile app is still in its initial phase, but will potentially be rolling out either late this year or early 2017. 
“We really want to make sure the app is effective and accessible before releasing it,” Trevor Gutierrez said. “But we do plan to do an early release for USC students to test out before we officially hit the market.” 
As for the Ignite blog, media campaign and merchandise store, the Gutierrez siblings plan to initiate these project aspects in the upcoming semester. 
“We plan to hold a couple of fairs in the upcoming months for students to come and test out our product,” Trevor Gutierrez said. 
Currently, the Gutierrez siblings are still in the midst of conducting research and will soon release a survey catered to USC students in hopes to gain a better perspective.
“We want to get the USC student angle on Ignite, because really, Ignite was made for the USC student,” Catalina Gutierrez said. “That being said, we do eventually hope to make Ignite available to all young adults alike; but at the end of the day, it comes back to helping this school out and making USC proud.”

Photo courtesy of USC NewsA man with a plan · Earl Paysinger meets with USC President C. L. Max Nikias after an LAPD Cadet Leadership Program event in 2014.
It’s been a long road for Earl Paysinger. He became an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department in the 1970s and served for over four decades. Afterward, he sought to make a difference in the community by empowering youth through the LAPD Cadets Academy Leadership program since 2006. Now, he has made the decision to join the Trojan Family as the new vice president of civic engagement.
“He’s got an intimate knowledge of the city, particularly the areas surrounding our campuses,” said Thomas S. Sayles, senior vice president of university relations, in an interview with USC News. “Part of his role was to engage with the community, and this will be an opportunity to utilize all that experience to further expand our work with residents and community-based organizations.”
Now with some experience after starting work in July, Paysinger talked to the Daily Trojan about his experiences at the University thus far and the changes he plans to make in the future.
Daily Trojan: Could you give a quick summary of what the VP of Civic Engagement does? What would be a typical day for you?
Earl Paysinger: There’s never a typical day. Our primary responsibility, as I mentioned earlier, is community outreach and community development. Not only looking at vast territories of the community and business centers, but even beyond that to create opportunities for our youth to learn and grow. It’s also about making opportunities for businesses to become more sustainable and productive. That not only builds the character of the business, but allows them to  hire local workers, people with families that live in the [place] and worship in the neighborhood. As these businesses grow, and economic opportunities grow for families, it helps families become more solid and meaningful. 
With civic engagement, part of what we do is we act as a conduit to nearly 20 other community outreach systems. Many schools and colleges have their own civic engagement or community outreach opportunities for individuals who are responsible for that, and we partner with them and help them understand some of the other programs and resources that are available throughout the University. They can apply them to their school or college, so not only are the students and faculty and community aware of what that school has to offer, but they are aware of other opportunities in the University. 
Additionally, we provide opportunities for students to volunteer, for outreach, and for mentoring in the community. I recently had the opportunity to speak with 500 freshmen from the New North Residential College not too long ago at the start of the new year, and I challenged them to imagine what would it be like if every student every week for 52 weeks volunteered one hour a day. That is the kind of crusade that Civic Engagement is trying to make happen, so USC not only becomes the most preeminent learning institute in the world, but also sets the standard for community outreach and service to which all other learning institutes in the world are held by.
DT: What made you want to step up and be a part of the Trojan family in the capacity that you are now? And why community outreach through USC?
EP: The community outreach and youth development really have defined who I am and who I have been for many years. I started out as a member of the LAPD, and I recognized early on the idea of community outreach and youth development. Partnering with the community can help them become safer and more sustainable, but also help them achieve identity and fortitude, which was really the principle way I believed could address crime and quality of life in the community. 
I was [contacted] by the USC administration, specifically President Nikias, and I mentioned to him I was nearing retirement. We talked about the importance of outreach, which for decades has been a principal mission. It seemed to me that there was not only a nexus but almost a symbiotic relationship between his vision and the vision of the University and mine, as I had come to believe, not only for the LAPD and law enforcement in general, but for USC. It was a perfect match.
DT: What do you feel is the most rewarding aspect of your job?
EP: Probably seeing the joy of young people realizing their dreams. So often young people and families in the community aren’t provided the opportunities or they don’t know about them. To give an example, in the Neighborhood Academic Institute, kids have an opportunity to participate academically in a  program that guarantees them the ability to be students at USC starting in middle school. What’s better than that? To help a young person realize his or her dream, I can’t imagine that there’s something better or more meaningful besides raising your own kids. This is not only what USC does, it is what USC is defined as.
DT: Let’s say you still have the job five years from now. What is the number one thing you hope you would have accomplished by then?
EP: Part of it to create a symbiotic relationship between the community, not only with USC on this campus, but also the health science campus. It’s creating a symbiotic relationship between the community, with business interests of the community and with students in the community. What I hope to accomplish is that they will look to USC as an institute upon which they can depend and live more productive and prosperous lives.

Aren’t we all sick of speculating yet? Every possible outcome for Saturday’s season opening football game against Alabama has been written about. We have discussed what could happen if the Trojans win, lose or tie. In fact, we’ve done so much forecasting, it seems that come Saturday night, when the scores are all final, everyone will be able to turn to their friends smugly and say, “Well, I saw that one coming.”
Everyone has a different approach to the beginning of football season, and the fact that there are so many unique ways to experience football is one of the reasons it is such a popular sport. For example, there are the people (and there are a lot of them) who are all about the predictions and “what ifs.” The majority of my friends fall into this category and they frequently get in heated debates about whether or not head coach Clay Helton selected the correct starting quarterback.
There are the people who think they can coach or play better than the people on the field and sidelines. Most of the time this is just a ridiculously ignorant comment, but it can certainly be good for a laugh.
At USC, football is more than just a sport. It is the culture that comes with tailgates, Song Girls and a special white horse. The magic of football goes beyond the field, especially as a student, and that is something that has been out of reach because of the circumstances of this year’s opening game. Traveling to Dallas, playing the storied Alabama Crimson Tide — who are the defending champions and top-ranked team in the country no less — is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for most fans, student media and athletes, but it loses a little of the USC magic.
Nonetheless, I am ready for it to be game day. Saturday will mark what is bound to be an exceptional game in one way or another — it wouldn’t be a USC football season without some unanticipated intrigue.
Perhaps the following weekend will be even more exciting, however, when the Trojans return home to the Coliseum and Saturday becomes a day filled with Cardinal and Gold.
Of course football season isn’t just about the fluff: the marching band, the lighting of the torch, the Fight Song. More so than at other schools, the success of the football season is defined by results on the field. Football is a million-dollar industry and is treated like a business. Reputations, jobs and money are on the line every time the Trojans take the field, but isn’t it a little ridiculous to pin the success of the whole season on one game?
We as a fan base know little about redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne yet choose to continually decide whether or not he is qualified and capable of leading this team. How can we say he was or was not the correct choice? The same theory holds true for Helton.
While I understand and respect that football is the sport that a majority of people are the most passionate about, I have grown increasingly tired of the hoopla surrounding a game when there is no real gauge on what to expect.
Football season is back, and with it comes the highs and the lows of unguarded anticipation.

Tal Volk | Daily TrojanOh Captain! My Captain! · Junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson was one of four captains named for the upcoming season at Wednesday’s practice. Jackson is one of USC’s most athletic and dynamic players.
USC football wrapped up its penultimate pre-Alabama practice on Wednesday. The day before the team flies to Arlington for Saturday’s season opener, head coach Clay Helton and the Trojans continued to refine their game plan to beat the Tide. But first:
New Leadership
Helton announced USC’s team captains for the year, as elected by the players. Redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne and redshirt senior tackle Zach Banner were nominated for the offense, and junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson and senior linebacker Michael Hutchings were nominated on the defensive side.
“I’d love to congratulate those men,” Helton said. “They’ve done fine work over spring and summer to earn those positions.”
Timeshares
Helton also gave a few hints as to how the team would manage personnel on Saturday. The head coach was impressed by the fierce competition at left guard between redshirt sophomore Chris Brown and junior Damien Mama, and Helton said the pair would split playing time evenly between the two of them at the start of the season.
“We’ll sit down after tomorrow’s practice, visit with [offensive line] coach [Neil] Callaway and see who we’re going to start with,” Helton said.
One starter Helton was comfortable with naming, however, was sophomore lineman Chuma Edoga, as redshirt senior Chad Wheeler hasn’t recovered sufficiently from plantar fasciitis in his foot to occupy his usual spot at left tackle against Alabama. The duty to anchor the line and protect Browne’s blind side will instead go to 19-year-old Edoga, who drew two starts at right tackle last season.
Helton has expressed full confidence in his young linemen in the past, saying he had “no reservations” with rolling Edoga out against the Tide last week. As for Wheeler, Helton said he hoped to get “a couple series” out of the veteran. Redshirt freshman Ykili Ross and sophomore Marvell Tell were previously nursing injuries but practiced with no issues on Wednesday, and Helton confirmed they would both be featured against Alabama.
 “Right now, we’re feeling pretty healthy going into this game,” Helton said.
Osa Masina
Sophomore linebacker Osa Masina continued to practice despite being under criminal investigation for two separate incidents in Utah and Los Angeles. He will not travel with the team this weekend, and Helton would not comment on Masina’s practice participation, only saying that the team was following instructions from the University when handling its linebacker.
Adoree’ Jackson
Finally, Helton said he anticipated a lesser role on offense this season for spark plug Adoree’ Jackson. Although the junior regularly logged double-digit snaps per game as a receiver in 2015, Helton said he planned to give Jackson five to six offensive plays each week.
“I don’t think it’ll be what you saw last year — sometimes he got 15 to 20 plays,” Helton said. “I think it’ll be fewer [to] allow him to be what he truly is, which is one of the best corners in college football and a dynamic returner.”
Jackson said the decreased role on offense would allow him to relax more and focus on defense, and he looked forward to chipping in when needed.
“But I don’t think I will be needed,” Jackson said. “I think those guys are going to do a great job.”

Brian Ji | Daily TrojanSuperstar scorer · Senior midfielder Morgan Andrews led USC with 12 goals last season, earning a spot on the MAC Hermann watchlist.
The women’s soccer team is taking a trip to the South this weekend to face off against the University of Georgia and No. 12 Auburn University in the Auburn Soccer Classic. 
The Trojans enter this weekend with a 1-2 record in non-friendly competition. They’ll face an important opponent in their second game of the tournament against Auburn, a team known for pressing the attack and forcing mistakes on defense. Auburn will bring an impressive own set of offensive firepower, fueled by senior attacking midfielder Casie Ramsier, who was named to a list of 36 players on the MAC Hermann Watch List in July. 
“These are two highly skilled teams that we’re facing [this weekend],” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “SEC teams will run at you. They’re very athletic and it’s going to give us a challenge.”
But the Trojan lineup is equally stacked with praiseworthy players. Senior defender Kayla Mills and senior midfielder Morgan Andrews were also named as potential MAC Hermann recipients, making USC one of seven schools to boast multiple players on the list. And a new influx of freshman strikers such as Taylor McMorrow is adding new life to an offense that struggled to connect last year.
Last season’s main difficulties came from a lack of finishing. Although the Trojans often dominated possession through solid defensive and midfield play, the front line struggled to convert offensive opportunities into points. This led to a style of offense that didn’t pressure defensive backs as much as McAlpine wanted.
“In the past, teams weren’t as concerned with our front line and the pressure they could bring,” McAlpine said. “Last year, we were a team built on defense.”
This year’s pace of attack is much more of his speed, with a mix of experienced and fresh strikers to create more pressure in the front line. Now, the main focus for McAlpine has shifted toward cementing a backline that has seen a great deal of transition since last season. 
The team started this season off balance, dropping two games to Santa Clara and Long Beach State in between dominating victories in exhibition games against Air Force and Beijing General. With a top 25 ranking and a Sweet Sixteen finish from last season, it was an unexpected way to kick off the year.
After an up-and-down start the year, the Trojans needed a win against No. 20 Pepperdine — and the front line delivered. An early penalty kick followed by two more goals in the first half was enough for the win, and McAlpine felt that his team gained a necessary boost in confidence following the 3-0 win. 
He looks forward to the weekend’s tournament with the expectation that both games will provide both a challenge and an opportunity for his team to make adjustments as they head into the regular season.
“They’re feeling good,” McAlpine said. “They’re definitely smiling a lot more during practice. I think everyone collectively made the decision to step up. They pulled together and locked in and the energy has been great since then. They’re ready to have fun this weekend.”

The Trojans will be primed for a major test as they open the season on Saturday against Alabama, the No. 1-ranked team in the nation. 
To preview the matchup, the Daily Trojan asked a few questions to Tyler Waldrep, the sports editor at The Crimson White. 
Daily Trojan: What would USC have to do to pull off the upset? 
Tyler Waldrep: The Trojans need to do what few teams have done in recent years and successfully run the football against Alabama’s front seven. Then, on defense, USC needs to put pressure on both of Alabama’s quarterbacks. Redshirt freshman Blake Barnett could be especially prone to turn the ball over if the Trojan pass rush gets home.
DT: What is Alabama’s game plan to slow down what is potentially a very high-scoring USC offense?
T.W.: I think Alabama’s game plan will likely involve taking away the run and forcing quarterback Max Browne to beat them with his arm. Alabama’s got a lot of experience and talent in the secondary, so Browne will need to be precise with where he places the football, but something tells me Alabama’s pass rushers don’t plan on giving him much time to evaluate his options.
DT: Who do you think Alabama will start at quarterback? What do each of the options bring to the table? 
T.W.: On Monday, [Alabama head coach Nick] Saban announced only two quarterbacks remained in contention to start this weekend, Barnett and Cooper Bateman. I expect Bateman will get the start since he is the only quarterback on the roster who has taken any snaps in a game before, but Barnett could be the more intriguing option on Saturday. He’s more athletic than Bateman and is capable of hurting the defense with either his arm or his legs; however, he doesn’t always make the right decision when it comes to protecting the football and keeping the offense moving in the right direction.
DT: As an SEC school, what is your perception of USC and the Pac-12 as a whole? 
T.W.: My personal opinion of USC is that it’s one of the few programs in the country that has the history, tradition and resources to contend for a national title almost — if not every — year. As for the Pac-12, I don’t think it gets a team in the playoff this season, but I do think it more often than not produces one of the top four teams in all of college football.
DT: [Former USC football coach] Lane Kiffin has an infamous past at USC. How has he fared as offensive coordinator at Alabama? 
T.W.: Some of the people in Tuscaloosa doubted Lane Kiffin at first, but it didn’t take long for him to win over his critics in the Alabama fan base. In two seasons he’s taken a pair of quarterbacks with relatively little experience (Blake Sims and Jake Coker) and turned them each into 3,000 yard passers that finished with a combined total of 55 passing touchdowns.
The Crimson White sounds too insensitive for the name of a paper in the South. Why didn’t you question him about that?
They could have used a name dealing with their mascot. Inquiring minds want to know.

Coming off a heartbreaking loss in the NCAA Championship to rival UCLA last season, the men’s water polo team is ready to make waves this season with another run for its 10th title following 11 straight appearances in the championship game.
Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
This Saturday, the Men of Troy will travel south to La Jolla to battle UC Irvine and Cal Baptist in the Triton Invitational at UC San Diego. 
The Trojans, coming off a 22-7 season, will return 15 of their top scorers, including their top five scoring threats, all of whom have another year of experience and growth under their belt. Junior brothers Blake and Lachlan Edwards will join Grant Stein and Matteo Morelli to form a dangerous offensive assault.
Of the 21 players who netted goals for USC last season, only six — Mac Carden (21), Luke Felton (13), Nick Lavayen (7), Tristan Reinhardt (5), Andrew Silvers (2) and Jake Sanders (1) —  are departing. 
Considering USC’s varied offensive weapons, 6-foot-9 junior McQuin Baron should have no trouble returning as starting goalie this season. Baron returns to USC with the seventh-most saves in USC history (570) with two seasons left in his collegiate career. 
After upsetting the No. 2 Cal Bears in last year’s NCAA semifinals, Baron (who had two clutch saves on Cal’s penalty shots) emphasized the importance of increased defense and the role he plays.
“Our team gets very energized, they get very, very excited when I block a shot,” Baron told NCAA.com’s John Reger last year. “I get excited when our team is enjoying our team defense. A lot of teams will get excited when they score a goal, but our team gets very excited when I make a shot block or a save.” 
Along with USC’s offense scoring 13.8 goals per game, Baron and the Trojan defense kept opposing offenses to just 6.2 goals per game, saving an average of 10.8 shots per game. 
The strength of the Trojans rests in their ability to get on the board early and often. In 2015, USC scored 212 of their 395 regulation goals in the first half of games. On the other hand, the Trojans’ defense was often exposed in the second half, allowing 98 goals compared to 81 in the first half. 
If the Trojans can clamp down on opponents in the third quarter specifically (55 goals allowed last season), they should see some more wins this year. 
Helping the veterans will be a group of talented freshmen that includes Marin Dasic, Thomas Dunstan, Chas Hornecker, Matt Maier, Will Rubschlager and Luke Wyatt. 
Dunstan, a two-meter “game-changer” who joined Baron on Team USA in Rio, can play excellent defense and will also aid the Trojans’ offense.
“Thomas is definitely one of the top two recruits in the nation this year,” co-head coach Jovan Vavic said of the freshman. “The kid is big, fast and a lefty. He’s a great swimmer, has long arms, can play at 2-meters, shoot from the outside, play 2-meter defense and help in the counterattack. He’s also a great passer — almost too unselfish in his passing. He’s really a complete package.”
Vavic has coached the team for more than 20 seasons, but this year will be joined by Marko Pintaric as a co-head coach. Pintaric has served as an assistant under Vavic for the past 15 seasons.
The Trojans start off their season this Saturday against UC Irvine and Cal Baptist. 
With a regular season schedule that includes games against top-ranked UC Santa Barbara, Stanford, Cal, Long Beach State, Pacific and UCLA (most of which will be at home), the Trojans will be tested early and often.

Taylor Gorski | Daily TrojanCoco for coconuts · The coconut acai bowl (above) is one of Amazebowls’ most popular items. The store is known for its simple menu of five different acai and pitaya bowls, usually blended with hemp milk and berries.
USC students are all too familiar with Amazebowls, the truck parked on campus to satisfy everyone’s on-the-go acai cravings. Amazebowls has stepped up their game from their standard four wheels, and now has a store location situated in the Arts District. It is only about a 10 minute drive from campus. Formerly a popular purple food truck, Amazebowls has finally expanded to its own restaurant location.
  With fresh white counters and a simple menu, their new space gives off a clean and minimalistic feel. Choose between three different bowls, the Amazebowl, Fresh Prince of Bowl Air, or Dragon Bowl-Z. An acai bowl is a fruit bowl filled up with fruits such as strawberries, berries and coconuts. Other ingredients granola and coconut shavings complete the bowl’s aesthetic. 
If visitors are not feeling a bowl, opt for one of their smoothies, the Berry Medley or Tropic Thunder. Unlike the Amazebowls food truck, you can order your acai bowl in a frozen coconut at the restaurant.  Topped with granola or trail mix, along with edible flowers, the coconut bowl option is almost too pretty to eat. One taste in, however, and it’ll be gone in a few quick minutes. 
Every bowl is delicious and perfectly smooth. Not only are the bowls amazing, but the staff is extremely friendly and hospitable. Ingredients such as ice and juice are not used in the making of the bowls. A good recommendation would be to replace the mint leaves with lemon or orange zest. 
The Fresh Prince of Bowl Air is known for its slushee type of acai at the bottom of the bowl. It contains acai, blueberries, pineapples, bananas, almond milk, mint with strawberries and agave. 
The original mini Amazebowl replaces the standard bananas with extra grapes and strawberries. The only downside of the restaurant is that the bowls are expensive, priced at $6.50 with other menu items at $7. Appealing to yoga fanatics and health nuts, every Amazebowl is extremely nutritious and only a few hundred calories. 
Those who have complained about the logistics of the truck will find that many of the problems don’t exist anymore. This is the first location of Amazebowls, and another one is set to open in Venice Beach very soon. Not only are Amazebowls Instagram worthy, but nutritious, delicious and aesthetically pleasing. It is open the week between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.

In the ancient Greek mythological text, Theogony, Hesiod narrates the coming of Gods into the universe that was originally in a state of chaos. Within this chaos comes a series of stable, analogous, mutually constitutive antitheses. These antitheses — night vs. day, human vs. divine and disorder vs. order (to name a few) can be viewed through the primary antithesis, female vs. male. This is due to the obsessive attention ancient Greek thought pays to gender. Gender basically determines the entirety of the cosmos.
Other antitheses, such as passion vs. reason, soft vs. hard and dark vs. light easily align with the female vs. male antithesis. This almost instinctual assigning of qualities to gender begs us to question how we think about female and male and why we think that way. 
Now, you’re probably wondering where I’m going with this. What the hell does Greek mythology and its specific attention to gender have to do with veganism? And why am I reading misogynistic ancient texts in my spare time? (answer: I’m not, it’s for a class). 
Theogony is one of the first sources of male hegemony. The male Gods control and shape civilization whilst regarding women as evil; in fact there is no race of women until Zeus creates Pandora. This masculine dogma — encompassing power, reason, and dominance — offers a lens to explore the relationship between meat and masculinity. 
The masculine idea that “you are what you are” (whereas femininity revolves around dressing up to become something) is embodied in this text, and has become part of our social dogma. However, men are not inherently controlling, aggressive and non-emotional. Men may feel that their gender is natural, but they actually perform masculinity as a script given to them by society. This idea of performativity is important because it limits who you can be. 
Statistically, there are more vegan women than vegan men. Big surprise. There is an unrelenting amount of social pressure on men to obtain optimum physical musculature (take a look at Arnold Schwarzenegger in Pumping Iron if you’re ready to witness the horrors of extreme masculinity). One of the most convenient ways to bulk up is to consume protein-packed meat. Not only is eating meat convenient, but it’s been ascribed to the dominant dogma. In other words, not eating meat puts a man’s machismo at steak — I mean stake. 
The idea of homosociality, or performing masculinity for the approval and recognition of other men, plays a vital role in the continual performativity of masculinity. Just as Arnold Schwarzenegger flashes his “guns” to the scrawny men in the gym, men eat meat when they’re together. When was the last time you saw a group of buff guys chowing down on sofritas at Chipotle? 
Homophobia and misogyny are main vectors through which heterosexual masculinity is secured and circulated. So, when a guy stops eating meat, his masculinity can become subordinate, and even questioned by his male friends who are desperately trying to secure their own masculinities. Thus, masculinity is structured through systems of reward and punishment. When a man cries, for instance, his tears can either be rewarded or punished; rewarded in somber situations such as when a family member passes away, and punished in situations where his sensitivity is deemed unmasculine, such as when he falls and scrapes his knee. 
So how can we push against the dogma and remove male veganism from subordinate forms of masculinity? Unfortunately, the construction of masculinity can’t come undone on a daily basis, as it has created regularity and that regularity has instituted a sense of comfort. To push against this comfort is the only method for progress.
We need to make it socially acceptable for men to feel vulnerable, to freely project their emotions and to feel compassion for other people and sentient beings. Fighting against this social stigma will give both males and females a sense of empowerment, because all identities intersect. After all, gender is just a social construct. 
I think that what the intertwined relationship between meat and masculinity comes down to is a complex system of oppression. Men are culturally reinforced to eat meat to free themselves from subordinate masculinity, but isn’t it ironic that by doing so, they’re losing power by abiding by this system? And if that’s countered by the argument that contributing to violence (toward animals and others) makes one powerful, what kind of society are we if that’s what we truly value? 
Moral of the story: It’s cool to be compassionate, regardless of gender. We all could use a little more love and compassion in our lives towards ourselves, the animals and our undogmatic identities.
Tessa Nesis is a sophomore majoring in NGOs and social change.  Her column, “The Sentient Bean,” runs on Thursdays.
It’s an old-fashioned idea that men need to eat meat to be macho, along the same lines as the notion that men need to hit women to show they are in charge. What men get from being meat and dairy consumers is an increased likelihood of heart attacks, cancer of the prostate and colon, high blood pressure and a fat gut. What’s more, there’s nothing quite as infantilizing as drinking milk, which nature only ever intended for babies. 
World number 1 tennis player, Novak Djokovic, Mr Universe, Barney D u Plessis, Germany’s strongest man, Patrik Baboumian; Russian Olympic gold-medallist Alexey Voyevoda and world free-running champion Tim Shieff, among others are vegans who are setting records in strength and speed while also promoting vegan eating. While not every man strives to be a champion athlete, most men want to live a long and healthy life and not have to turn to Viagra when the arteries to their sexual organs become clogged with fat. Also, the leading causes of premature death among American men – heart disease and strokes, for example – are preventable and, in some cases, reversible simply by adopting a plant-based diet. 
Aside from the health benefits of refusing to eat the flesh of sentient beings, anyone with any sense of empathy can imagine what life is like for animals raised on filthy, severely crowded factory farms where they are routinely castrated, debeaked and otherwise mutilated without painkillers and slaughtered in ways that would horrify any decent person, and everyone – regardless of gender – should reject all animal products.
Isn’t it far more manly to follow one’s own path and stand up for those who are vulnerable in society, rather than follow the herd and bully the weak? Plus, what’s manly about knowing what is right but not doing it because you’re too weak willed? And if you don’t know what’s right, then a real man seeks the knowledge to inform himself.
Thanks for the insightful comment, Ben! #govegan

Photo courtesy of PARTYBABYPop style · Punk duo PARTBABY consists of Jamie Reed and Noah Gersh (formerly of Portugal. The Man), will release their upcoming album The Golden Age of Bullsh*t on Friday. It touches on themes of heartbreak and cynicism.
PARTYBABY’s website assures fans that signing up for their email list won’t be for spam, just for perks and merchandise. In their words, “no bullsh*t from us. Promise.” That’s not just their website attitude — it’s also the attitude at the core of their upcoming album, The Golden Age of Bullsh*t, which will hit shelves Friday.
The L.A. punk duo consists of Jamie Reed and Noah Gersh (formerly of Portugal. The Man) and their charm extends beyond their music and into their hilarious and adventurous personas. The band takes themes of cynicism and heartbreak and disguises it as enthusiasm and lust for life. With skater rock influences, the band perfectly encapsulates a more adult version of skate culture characteristic angst and troublemaking.
Each song feels like a moment in time rather than a recording, almost as if Reed was the star of My So-Called Life, using his songs as the voiceover narrations showcasing rawness, honesty and immediacy. One of the three singles released ahead of the album, “Your Old Man,” is perhaps the best example of this. The song features Reed doing pop-punk-centered crooning as he asks no one in particular, “Do you ever talk to your old man / Does he understand, what we do, on the weekend?” A familiar feeling of a teen’s longing and listlessness comes to mind as you can’t help but to sing along to the catchy song. Where many artists of all medias romanticize the troublemaking skaters, PARTYBABY offers a fresh and new look at the reality of that culture and mindset. 
Another of their singles, “I Don’t Wanna Wait,” finds the pair hitting the more distinctive styles of their pop-punk/rock genre. It starts with a scream and quickly finds a beat in split second breaks and fast-paced notes. This single is the epitome of the bands time-traveling music. From early 2000s indie, late ’90s pop punk, ’60s crescendos and more, PARTYBABY knows how to take the best from those that came before and still make it their own.
For the last single, “Everything’s All Right,” the band hones in on its skate and surf punk vibes. The song plays with something to prove and it definitely proves it. But it goes beyond what people are shown over and over again with these genres. PARTYBABY is nuanced punk. It’s a throwback to the age of Jackass and Tony Hawk that still pushes forward into new territories.
The band’s imagery of a single dollar sign is fitting in how little it actually defines them. The emotion, strength and openness prevalent in the album is driven by anything but money. Even when the music hovers over pessimistic or negative topics, PARTYBABY still lines every gray cloud with a desire to excite people. And that’s exactly what they do in The Golden Age of Bullshit. They excite the listener until a primal hunger to devour and submit to all the music the band has to offer.
The beauty of PARTYBABY is that every song has its own voice and personality while still maintaining the band’s quintessential sound. THe band knows what its doing and it has the talent to back it up. Its stage and social media presence draws fans in. But at the end of the day, it goes beyond the checklist of what is good music. PARTYBABY is real. It’s authentic. It’s raw. It’s sincere. Most importantly, it cares. For those whose young adulthood was filled with troublemaking, running from cops and making bad decisions for the memories, PARTYBABY is like looking into a mirror. For those more sheltered, PARTYBABY is a fresh outlook on a different lifestyle with insight into the surprising amount of ways anyone can relate to it.
The album is set for release on Friday. The band recently finished supporting Swmrs and Wavves on their respective summer tours.

Design by Lily Vaughan
Three years ago, 79 police officers in riot gear responded to a noise complaint at a predominantly black and Latino off-campus USC party. In a video documenting the standoff, police are lined up from one side of the street to the other, forming a human barricade. Photos reveal a woman face down on the sidewalk, surrounded by at least four officers. All of this was for a noise complaint.
 Six students responded to the incident by filing a suit against the Los Angeles Police Department, citing racial bias because a predominantly white party across the street was not disturbed. This week, jurors concluded that “some of the officers used excessive force, did not have probable cause for an arrest and acted with malice.” However, they did not find that officers acted with racial bias.
The event sent shockwaves through the USC community and sparked much-needed conversations on diversity. But since then, USC has not responded aptly enough to improve the climate on campus. Student activists have worked tirelessly to urge the administration to implement reforms, yet the University’s responses seem to lack tangible and substantial policy outcomes. USC needs to stop addressing diversity and inclusion because it’s a buzzword and start implementing change because our students demand it. Students from black and brown backgrounds deserve not only to feel safe, but to feel welcome — and not just through a system of email assurances of inclusion measures or so-called cultural diversity events. 
The existence of a USC Diversity website ironically demonstrates the University’s tacit commitment to this effort. There, you can find detailed information on the Provost’s Task Force and other vague descriptions of programming. You can find a brief paragraph about the “Dedication of University Funds,” which describes mysterious funding going broadly toward diversity and inclusion with no date for implementation. We have yet to have any idea where these funds are coming from. There are no concrete plans.
For years, one major ongoing battle between students and administration was the lack of transparency and communication between the two parties, and while the website is a nice attempt, it demonstrates that transparency is still a real issue. In July, the Campus Climate Coalition shed light on some of the organizational frustration, including a lack of transparency through a post on Facebook. “At the end of the spring semester, the Campus Climate Coalition seceded from the Diversity Task Force after numerous weeks and more than a hundred hours of tokenized consultation, with the recommendations we submitted being diluted at best or co-opted at worst. This resulted in a number of deceptive policy changes that act in the name of diversity and inclusion without truly committing to substantial changes that were within the administration’s power.” The post depicts students being pushed out of a conversation that is literally by and for students. That is absurd. 
 Students must continue to organize. We need to continue to come together and organize around diversity on our campus. We must act with a sense of urgency. Students are the ones who don’t feel comfortable on campus. They are the ones who know when the police show up to break up a party, that they better leave — because their life depends on it. 
It is up to the student body to stand up and fight for them, to ensure that future generations of diverse Trojans can be supported by a well funded cultural community and not feel that their lives are at risk.

Facebook is relatively transparent about why you see certain advertisements. Any user can go into “Ad Preferences” and see how Facebook targets its ads. For example, Facebook thinks I will be interested in, and therefore more likely to click on, ads that concern Beyoncé, Postmates and irony. The New York Times  this week brought to the attention of readers that the ad preferences page also labels the political party to which a user is most likely to belong. For me, right under the “Lifestyle and Culture” tab is a little box that says “US Politics (Very Liberal).”
It’s not surprising that a website that knows the places I’ve lived, the pages I’ve clicked on, my age, race and more would be able to determine my interests and opinions with at least some accuracy. And while I would never complain about Facebook showing me more ads related to Beyoncé, the labeling of users as conservative or liberal has worrisome implications. By pigeonholing users on one end of the political spectrum or another, Facebook is inadvertently increasing the partisanship sentiment that characterizes much of the nation’s political discourse. When Facebook’s privacy terms and conditions, especially surrounding allowed and disallowed content and censorship is taken into account, the combination of the two may result very easily in a real threat to open, unadulterated and bipartisan political discourse.
This year, Pew Research Center conducted a survey on “news use across social media.” The researchers determined that 62 percent of adults in the U.S. use social media sites to get news. Facebook’s contribution to this growing trend is significant. In fact, 44 percent of  adults use Facebook in particular as a news source. If you narrow the group to just millennials, the reliance becomes even more prominent; according to the American Press Institute, 88 percent of millennials regularly get news from Facebook. 
The labeling of users as conservative or liberal in order to customize ads should be concerning. According to the Pew Research Center, “more than half of Democrats (55 percent) say the Republican Party makes them ‘afraid,’ while 49 percent of Republicans say the same about the Democratic Party.” Intense political partisanship has characterized much of the 2016 election and shows no signs of ending soon. Intense, legitimate ideological differences are understandable, even desirable. However, isolating groups from seeing the views of others only serves to heighten feelings of mistrust and animosity. 
But turning away from traditional news sources doesn’t necessarily mean the death of healthy democratic deliberation. Due to the user-driven nature of social media, news that would have been looked over or deliberately censored by the mainstream media has been able to garner mainstream attention. Social media also has the power to propel lesser-known candidates to the main stage (see Bernie Sanders). Despite these obvious benefits, however, the ubiquity of Facebook makes it easier to contain individuals within narrower and narrower ideological bubbles, while also forcing the general public to trust that the often secretive company will not censor certain groups. 
Accusations of bias and censorship in Facebook’s policies and algorithms have originated from every corner of the political spectrum. Matt Orfalea, whose Facebook profile picture and cover photo both prominently feature Jill Stein, claims that a video he posted of PBS censoring Jill Stein was removed from Facebook without explanation. Last week, two extremely popular libertarian Facebook groups were shut down. Facebook later restored the accounts, claiming they had been removed in error. Black Lives Matter activists have cited the temporary deletion of Korryn Gaine’s livestream as evidence of Facebook’s censorship, or even complicity in police cover-ups. 
Whether these incidents have been caused by human error, technical glitches or legitimate violations of Facebook’s policies, these claims of censorship should not be taken lightly. Facebook is a private company that can subject its users to its own terms and conditions. But too many people rely on Facebook for news, political debates and information sharing for the site to arbitrarily decide which political groups it will allow and which must be shut down. 
Lately, my Facebook feed has been bluer than usual. I see the same few people posting the same few articles that all espouse views that I generally agree with. I see ads from The Nation, Mother Jones, and ThinkProgress more often than anything else. While I may not click on a Breitbart article if it were to ever show up on my newsfeed, the ideological bubbles Facebook is forcing users into skews perceptions of the most important issues the world faces today.

Calling all vegans, vegetarians, food-lovers or east-coast natives: the infamous By Chloe (which has been featured in Vogue, The Food Network, PopSugar, Nylon and the New York Times) has come to LA – and let me tell you, it’s here to stay.
With two locations in NYC (and two more on the way!), and two stores set to open up in Boston, it only makes sense that the much-Instagrammed food sensation popped up in our very own backyard – after all, we are the west-coast-fitness-junkies-summer-loving-food-obsessed-Instagrammers, right?
The entire menu at By Chloe, as you may well have guessed, is #vegan! However, I’m not talking about those vegan salads you see where it’s 99% a bowl of lettuce and kale and 1% some kind of raw vegetable – I’m talking sweet potato fries, milkshakes, burgers, mac n’ cheese and hash browns (don’t worry, you can still get your super-greens cold pressed juice and salad to-go, too, if that’s really what you want).
And it’s surprisingly affordable!
Located in Silverlake, By Chloe is far, but not too far, and well worth the uber fare (split fare with your friends, people, be social). 
But be warned: THEY DO NOT TAKE BOOKINGS! You’re going to have to either get there early, or wait in line, but either way I can personally guarantee you, your stomach and your Instagram followers will thank you.
Still not sold? Check them out yourself at bychefchloe.com!
