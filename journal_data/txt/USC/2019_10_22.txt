Coming off a strong performance at the Women of Troy Fall Invitational, the USC women’s tennis team looked to keep rolling as it headed to San Diego for the ITA Southwest Regionals this past weekend.
Among the Trojans’ competition in the four-day tournament were Hawaii, Pepperdine, San Diego, Arizona, San Diego State, UC Santa Barbara and UCLA.
The doubles portion of the tournament began in the Round of 64, in which freshman Eryn Cayetano and sophomore Danielle Willson had a bye. In the Round of 32, the two swiftly defeated Hawaii freshman Madison Kim and senior Petra Melounova 8-5. 
Following the win, the pair faced off against the senior-sophomore duo of UC Santa Barbara’s Dominika Paterova and Shakhnoza Khatamova. In an even more dominant fashion than their first win, Cayetano and Willson comfortably beat the pair 8-1.
On the last day of the tournament, Cayetano and Willson squared off against San Diego State sophomore Alicia Melosch and junior Nnena Nadozie. The Trojans continued what seemed to be an unstoppable streak by defeating the Aztecs 8-5.
Fittingly, the Trojans’ semifinal match was against none other than UCLA. The Bruins’ doubles team consisted of junior Abi Altick and sophomore Taylor Johnson. 
Altick and Johnson bested Cayetano and Willson in a close first set, 6-4. Despite the Trojans’ efforts to stay alive, they were eliminated in the following set by a 6-2 score. 
Cayetano and Willson were not the only Trojans to pair up in the doubles tournament. Sophomore Salma Ewing and senior Sydney Van Alphen — as well as the team of sophomore Estella Jaeger and junior Ana Neffa — fell at the hands of Arizona doubles teams.
The singles tournament saw a few Trojans advance, but USC went out much quieter than in doubles play.
Jaeger was victorious in the Round of 128 by winning both sets 6-4 but was defeated in the following round. Van Alphen took her match 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 in the Round of 64 but lost in the Round of 32 to Hawaii junior Bojana Markovic.
Along with her doubles play, Willson fared well in the singles part of the tournament. She and Ewing were the only remaining Trojans heading into the Round of 16. 
After a back-and-forth match with freshman Lisa Zarr of Pepperdine, Willson failed to find the same success she had in the doubles tournament and took the loss 5-7, 6-3, 6-3. Ewing managed to take care of business in the round, however, and won a 6-3, 6-4 match against San Diego senior Kati Kukaras. 
Ewing’s quest for the singles crown came up short the next day when UCLA freshman Abbey Forbes beat her in back-to-back sets.
After such a strong showing against New Mexico, Loyola Marymount and Iowa State in the Women of Troy Invitational earlier this month, the Trojan women did not find as much success in this tournament. The team had a singles record of 11-1 and a doubles record of 5-1 in the previous tournament — but the Trojans ended this weekend with a combined 6-5 record in singles matchups and a 3-3 record in doubles play. 
The Trojan women will look to get back on track as they prepare for the ITA Fall Nationals.

Throughout my four years of high school, I played varsity tennis. My doubles partner and I made the postseason each year, and it was one of the most enjoyable activities I did in high school. I also liked to play badminton during physical education class and routinely played at a friend’s house.
Net sports like those were my favorite sports to play growing up. I never imagined another variation of tennis until my PE teacher taught us a sport called pickleball. Pickleball, which follows the same general rules as tennis, uses a much smaller court and a paddle instead of rackets. The ball used is similar to a wiffle ball, but it’s a little bigger and has additional small holes. 
Pickleball can be played at all ages and does not require much money. Sets can be found for less than $50 and can be set up in the backyard, driveway or even inside. 
Pickleball is on the rise, but it’s still considered a backyard activity by many, and few people tend to take it seriously as a sport.
According to the USA Pickleball Association, pickleball’s numbers have increased by 650% over the last six years. The USAPA holds many competitions all across the country as well as a national tournament. There is even a pickleball-themed restaurant called “Chicken N Pickle” in Kansas City, Mo., and Wichita, Kan., which features both indoor and outdoor courts. 
Nonetheless, there are plenty of people that don’t count pickleball as a “real sport,” and it’s still unknown to many. With net sports like tennis and volleyball dominating, people clearly could not care less about a sport that uses paddles and a plastic ball.
To be fair, it’s hard to blame people who don’t take pickleball too seriously. There are no professional leagues anywhere near as large as the NFL or MLB, and there aren’t even official pickleball teams in high school. Why, then, should pickleball be acknowledged as a real sport like football and baseball?
Despite its seemingly casual nature, pickleball is an athletic activity that produces a winner and a loser at the end of a match. It also takes plenty of skill to be good at pickleball. Whether it’s strategic planning during matches or practicing the right form to achieve good topspin, pickleball requires practice and training just like any other sport. 
When compared to other net sports like badminton and pingpong (which are both Olympic sports), pickleball does not generate nearly the same level of recognition. Personally, I do not see a dramatic difference between pingpong and pickleball in terms of the setup, gameplay and numbers of players. The only difference is that pingpong has been popular for a long time, unlike pickleball.
Despite the lack of attention, pickleball has been gaining traction both recreationally and professionally around the world. A big reason for this is simply word of mouth. People who play pickleball like to invite others to play with them since it is not hard to get supplies or to play. 
Consequently, pickleball fans and players are hoping that the sport can make it to the Olympics by 2028.
According to pickleballportal.com, “Pickleball would need to be recognized by the International Olympic Committee. The main criteria are that the sport must be played in 75 countries across four continents for Mens competition or 40 countries on three continents for female sports … and pickleball is not there yet.”
If all goes as planned, it may not not be too far-fetched to see pickleball played in the Los Angeles Games in 2028. After all, skateboarding and surfing will be included in next year’s Olympics in Tokyo, which almost no one would have predicted 10 years ago. 
More people should know about and play pickleball because it simply is a fun activity that doesn’t take up too much time or cost too much money. It is a convenient, fun way to exercise with friends. 
Recently, more and more people have been advocating for pickleball, and there is definitely a good reason to do so. Maybe one day, someone’s go-to casual backyard activity can turn them into an Olympic champion.

The regular season is just past the halfway point, but preseason Pac-12 predictions have already been turned upside down. Whether it was USC’s Week 4 victory over Utah led by third-string redshirt junior quarterback Matt Fink or UCLA’s wild 67-63 win at Washington State, this conference continues to produce surprising upsets and unpredictable turns.
Though the Pac-12 Championship in Santa Clara still lies over six weeks in the distance, 4-3 USC is training its eyes on the title. Head coach Clay Helton has made clear his team’s goal to reclaim the title it brought home in 2017.
“We’ve got six games to really put our best foot forward in our conference,” Helton said after USC’s Week 7 loss to No. 8 Notre Dame. “We control our own destiny on our way to a Pac-12 title, and that’s what we’ve got to do.”
With its lopsided 41-14 win over Arizona Saturday in which USC’s battered defense contained dual-threat senior quarterback Khalil Tate’s offense to 385 yards, the Trojans stayed atop the Pac-12 South by virtue of the head-to-head tiebreaker with No. 12 Utah. USC has yet to win an away game though, and it must step up on the road in order to claim a spot in the conference championship. 
Utah clobbered No. 24 Arizona State in Salt Lake City Saturday, securing second place in the South. Utah seniors quarterback Tyler Huntley and running back Zack Moss displayed their trademark chemistry, as Huntley posted 171 passing yards while Moss ran for 99 yards to break his school’s career rushing yards record. The only defense seemingly capable of knocking this dominant pair off its perch is Washington’s, and the team’s Nov. 2 matchup at Husky Stadium should be a critical game in Utah’s push for the conference championship. 
Sitting one game behind USC and Utah in the South is Arizona State. The Sun Devils have been the Pac-12 wild card this season; one game, they beat then-No.18 Michigan State in a road thriller, and the next they lost to arguably the worst team in the conference, Colorado. The Sun Devils’ unpredictability could throw the Trojans for a loop when the teams face off Week 11 in Tempe, Ariz., as USC is already vulnerable on the road. 
ASU’s offense also features a true freshman quarterback in Jayden Daniels. In his debut season, Daniels has already thrown for 1635 yards and rushed for 206, tied with Tate for the second most rushing yards by a Pac-12 quarterback. His agility and versatility behind center will pose a challenge for USC’s young defense that has struggled to contain mobile quarterbacks this year. 
Leading the Pac-12 North is No. 11 Oregon, the only team unbeaten in conference play. Senior quarterback Justin Herbert, essentially a definite first round pick in the upcoming NFL Draft, averages nearly 269 yards and three touchdowns per game in a pass-heavy offensive scheme. 
Expect the Ducks to mow down Washington State next week. The true test comes when Oregon plays USC at the Coliseum the following game, where the Ducks’ dominant offense faces off against the Trojans’ surprisingly stingy secondary. The result may depend on whether key USC players like sophomores safety Talanoa Hufanga and inside linebacker Palaie Gaoteote IV are healthy enough to contribute.
Cal, Washington State, Stanford, Washington and Colorado have each lost three games in the conference, a massive blow to their championship hopes. This week’s game at Colorado should boost the Trojans’ confidence in their ability to win away from the Coliseum, preparing them for key road conference battles against Arizona State and Cal following the home bout with the Ducks.
While Oregon has all but wrapped up the North division, the South is still completely up for grabs. If the first half of the season is any indicator, Pac-12 fans can expect upsets, comebacks and plenty of movement in the standings leading up to championship weekend.

Two days after a dominant 41-14 win over Arizona, USC’s offense focused Monday’s practice on the quick turnaround before its road game against Colorado Friday. 
Head coach Clay Helton provided updates on a roster that has been riddled with injuries the past few weeks. 
None of the six players injured Saturday are medically cleared for Friday’s game. Both redshirt freshman outside linebacker Abdul-Malik McClain and sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga are out with shoulder dislocations. Standout freshman defensive end Drake Jackson suffered a high ankle sprain and returned to the sidelines Saturday in a boot. 
On the offensive side, junior tailback Stephen Carr is recovering from a hamstring strain and redshirt freshman tailback Markese Stepp suffered a torn ankle ligament that requires surgery and up to five weeks of recovery. Freshman wide receiver Munir McClain requires season-ending surgery for an ACL tear. 
Four players missed the Arizona game, including redshirt senior defensive lineman Christian Rector and sophomore inside linebacker Palaie Gaoteote IV, who are both out indefinitely with ankle injuries. The other two, sophomore cornerback Olaijah Griffin and redshirt sophomore cornerback Greg Johnson, practiced Monday. 
Helton expressed his confidence in their recovery and the team’s ability to make the necessary adjustments.
“There’s injuries that happen all through the country and all college teams,” Helton said. “As a coach, we’re not paid to make excuses. We’re paid to find answers, and we’ll find those answers.”
The Trojans hope that those answers lie in their deep roster. After a breakout performance with 103 rushing yards and two touchdowns against the Wildcats, freshman running back Kenan Christon was given the green light for the Colorado game. Christon will join redshirt junior tailback Quincy Jountti and redshirt senior cornerback Dominic Davis in filling the void at the position. 
Freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis will have to gauge this offense’s new speed while improving his own rhythm, something he expressed as a current weakness. Arizona was the second straight game without an interception for Slovis, who compiled 232 passing yards and two touchdowns after a slow first quarter.
Helton said Slovis will need to improve his decision-making within the pocket moving forward. Going into Slovis’s fourth start, Helton emphasized “letting the game come to him” as he improves his ability to escape the pocket for five or six-yard gains to avoid sacks.
“I feel a lot better [since] I first started playing here from the Stanford game, even getting reps from practice. As the one [quarterback], you get a lot more,” Slovis said.
Colorado will be the fourth road game for the Trojans, who have yet to win a game outside the Coliseum. The narrow loss at No. 8 Notre Dame highlighted some defensive weaknesses but also proved the offense’s potential, with Slovis throwing for 255 passing yards.
“I don’t know if it really matters that much being on the road,” Slovis said. “We haven’t won on the road, but you can see we can play well on the road. We did it with Notre Dame.”
Friday may be the game for USC to finally turn its road struggles around as the Buffaloes are in the midst of a three-game losing streak. Both their offense and defense took embarrassing hits in a blowout loss to Washington State last weekend, meaning the Trojans’ patchwork lineup could still make easy work of the Buffs.
Coming off a short week of rest, the Trojans’ performance in Colorado will provide a solid test of the bench’s ability to keep USC alive until its key players return. “Next man up” is the motto moving forward, but every lineup has an expendable limit. It is yet to be seen if the Trojans have reached theirs.

Take a stroll through USC Village, and myriad trends may stick out — a variety of reusable grocery totes, Hydroflasks, drinking utensils ranging from paper straws to Starbucks sippy cups to plastic straws sticking out from the sippy cups. Go to the Row on a Friday night, and you may notice red Solo cups scattered across front lawns, e-cigarettes flashing and fuming and free Lyft rides congesting the narrow streets near campus.
These details, although microscopic, highlight the larger conversation regarding environmental awareness on campus and students’ varying approaches to it. Freshly inaugurated, President Carol Folt listed sustainability as one of her top priorities on campus, claiming she will work with students to foster conversations regarding more environmentally mindful practices. 
Although the Sustainability 2028 Plan is in development, sustainability needs to be prioritized beyond endorsing surface-level initiatives like reusable straws. To institutionalize an environmentally cognizant campus, students must stop intrinsically contradicting themselves and instead devote themselves to attitudes that promote more consistent sustainability practices.   
One of today’s most widely practiced sustainability measures gained momentum with a viral video of a sea turtle with a plastic, bendy straw lodged up its nose. Consequently, activists across the nation endorsed the use of reusable straws as an alternative to disposable plastic straws in an effort to raise awareness of ocean pollution and its impact on marine life. 
It eventually gained legislative traction as Seattle became the largest U.S. city to ban plastic straws in June 2018, with many others following suit. The movement has even extended to major fast food corporations like Starbucks, which recently introduced strawless lids as part of an initiative to remove all plastic straws from an estimated 25,000 of its locations worldwide by 2020. 
This trend of moving toward a strawless society definitely has meaning behind it — after all, according to a report by the environmental group Better Alternatives Now, straws and stirrers did account for 7% of plastic items found along the California coastline. 
However, out of the 8 million tons of plastic that flow into the ocean every year, straws only account for about 0.025% of it by weight. While any effort toward change helps a facet of the environmental crisis, these statistics justify how we have much bigger fish to fry. In fact, a recent study by Ocean Cleanup estimated that about half of the plastic waste in the Great Pacific Garbage patch came from fishing nets and commercial fishing. 
In addition to the strawless movement, the consumption of nondairy alternatives to milk, especially almond milk, has drastically risen in popularity over the past decade. While some see almonds as a sustainable option due to their smaller carbon footprint compared to livestock, they actually require about 15 gallons of water for every 16 produced, which is especially concerning when a drought-stricken state like California produces about 80% of the world’s almonds. 
These statistics suggest that there is fine intent behind these efforts, but this extreme attention to these miniscule solutions distracts students from large-scale problems like commercial fishing, ocean pollution contribution and climate change. 
Furthermore, while students may believe that these behaviors alleviate their consumerism’s impact, their contributions would be more significant if they approached the issue holistically. Instead of using a metal straw to flex environmental awareness, they should refrain from practicing environmentally hazardous habits such as vaping from nonreusable plastic pods, taking unnecessarily long showers and choosing to take a car to destinations reachable by the Metro or LADOT Dash. 
To adopt a more meaningful approach to environmental mindfulness, students must be steady with their sustainability practices. That doesn’t mean they should ditch the strawless movement; it means they should take it beyond the sea turtle video.
It means they should consider the implications of drinking almond milk over dairy for the sole purpose of being more sustainable, especially when oats and soy also exist as dairy alternatives and actually require far less water than almonds. It also means thinking twice before taking that Fryft to a party that can be easily — but also safely — trekked, and taking the Metro or other forms of public transportation. And, it means to continue looking at change from the big picture perspective with climate strikes for policy change and for combatting major corporations such as Coca-Cola, which contribute the most to the global waste aggregate. 
Looking forward, this refined mindset could move beyond plastic straw shaming to proactive and significant universal improvements.

In 1970, psychologist David Myers administered a racial bias test to 326 high schoolers and separated them into three groups based on what their survey responses suggested: high, medium or low prejudice. He found that after just two minutes of discussion among each group, the high prejudice group developed even more racist views while the low prejudice group took an increasingly anti-discriminatory stance. Myers’ study illustrates the phenomenon of group polarization: Groups of like-minded people who discuss a topic together will arrive at a conclusion more extreme than the positions they held individually prior to deliberation.
This psychological experiment displays the way political parties become more polarized within information echo chambers, in which repetition and the lack of exposure to alternative views amplifies already existing beliefs. As the 2020 election approaches and candidates from both sides of the aisle attack each other with renewed animosity, it feels like party rifts are deeper than ever. Neuroscience reveals that while polarization is, in fact, extensively rooted in the brain, it can be overcome with communication and compassion.
The neural mechanisms that underly group influence reveal why it is so effective in radicalizing beliefs. A study published in Psychological Science identified oxytocin as a hormone that strengthens in-group identity and makes people less accepting of perceived outsiders. This means that there is a biological factor driving us to conform with a group opinion. 
Furthermore, according to psychologist Sophia Moskalenko, groups promote more extreme views through two types of influences: informational and social. Informational influences provide us with additional evidence to support our claims and strengthen our beliefs in them. Social influences push us to emulate others’ opinions to protect ourselves from fear of judgment. These behavioral mechanisms make sociopolitical discourse a powerful tool in polarizing opinions, and unfortunately, the advent of social media has increased their role in widening the political gap.
As social media becomes a widespread source for information about politics, group polarization can have an even greater scope and impact, and echo chambers become even more prevalent in radicalizing opinions. Before, Americans had to meet in person to talk about politics, and now, they can exchange ideas with millions of people from home with just a few taps of the keyboard or phone screen. If someone shows up in your feed with contradicting opinions, you can easily delete or block them. In this way, social media allows us to curate our own echo chambers that reaffirm our beliefs while minimizing exposure to contradicting ideas.
The most effective way to combat group polarization is by having open, honest conversations with the opposing side. However, this is much easier said than done due to the mischaracterization and miscommunication between people with differing political views. A 2018 study by psychologist Daniel Yudkin revealed a strong connection between an individual’s core and political beliefs — those core beliefs can interfere with empathizing with people who have differing beliefs. 
Yudkin’s survey of more than 8,000 Americans found that conservatives tend to consider personal responsibility a key determinant of individual success, whereas liberals view factors beyond one’s control as facilitators and barriers to success. Consequently, both sides misinterpret the other’s worldview — conservatives see liberals’ emphasis on circumstance as “weakness and self-indulgence,” and liberals think of conservatives’ bootstraps mentality as “chauvinism and victim-blaming.” 
Despite the animosity toward differing ideologies displayed by the participants, Yudkins’ study actually provides hope for healing the bipartisan divide because it revealed that political differences are not as severe as they are perceived to be. Instead, they stem from a lack of understanding and mischaracterization of the other side.
In 1995, psychologist Mona Weissmark organized a facilitated discussion for 20 people in Chicago — half descended from slave owners and the other half descended from slaves. In the four days of discourse that followed, the two groups were able to reconcile their differences by openly confronting feelings of guilt and resentment and listening to each other. Weissmark’s facilitated discussions provide hope that differences of any magnitude can be overcome. 
To overcome group polarization, we must engage in meaningful political discourse with people who have differing views instead of jumping to attack the other side or blocking them from our information feeds entirely.

When “Zombieland” premiered in 2009, public fascination surrounding deteriorated, living carcasses was in its prime. The “28 Weeks” films and “Shaun of the Dead” all gained a cult following. “The Walking Dead” was about to become one of the most popular shows of the decade. In fact, it was so popular that the show inspired a spin-off series, “Fear the Walking Dead.” Even Brad Pitt got in on the craze with his performance in “World War Z.” 
But with “Zombieland,” viewers see a divergence from the gritty, post-apocalyptic wastelands of these films with metacommentary on just how fun going on a zombie-killing spree can be.
The original, star-studded cast is back in “Zombieland 2: Double Tap,” but Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg and Abigail Breslin look much different today than they did a decade ago. Stone is now one of the top actresses in the world. Eisenberg was able to break away from being a Michael Cera look-alike. Harrelson continues to be one of the most underappreciated actors and Breslin is no longer that child actor from “Little Miss Sunshine.”
Even the production team has matured. Writers Rhett Rhesse and Paul Wernick penned the fan-favorite “Deadpool,” signaling evolution in their metacommentary style. Even director Ruben Fleischer is now recognized as a bankable director after his commercial hit last year with “Venom.” 
With a cast and crew that garners more prominence today, a sequel to a cult-favorite zombie film from a decade ago doesn’t seem to be the best use of their talent. However, rather than falling victim to sequel-itis, “Zombieland: Double Tap” embraces its zany premise for a film that shows audiences a good time.
Ten years later, Tallahassee (Harrelson), Wichita (Stone), Columbus (Eisenberg) and Little Rock (Breslin) are no longer driven to receive “Zombie Kill of the Week” or “Zombie Kill of the Year” awards now that everyone seems to be stepping up their game. Now, they long for domesticity, and what better place to settle down in than at the White House? 
The place where executive orders are signed off becomes home to Christmas gifts wrapped in presidential portraits. Yet, domestic bliss only lasts so long for Little Rock, who feels trapped living in the White House; she wants to explore the world with people her age. In the case of Wichita, thoughts of marriage and settling down terrify her. Abruptly, both Little Rock and Wichita leave Columbus and Tallahassee all alone — that is, until Little Rock also leaves Wichita by herself. Now, the group must hit the road to find her. Kills will now be harder to come by, as a new form of zombie — the “T-800” — has become more elusive to kill.
“Double Tap” successfully embraces the dynamic chemistry between the four protagonists. They are emblematic of a dysfunctional family, as most of the laughs come from their ridiculous arguments about Elvis Presley or from heartbreak. Harrelson stands out among the four simply for being the most over-the-top character. This is a man who doesn’t care about political correctness while also being a caring father to Little Rock. He seems to be having the most fun reveling in the ridiculousness of his character, kicking and screaming like a child in one scene and being a badass zombie killer in the next. 
Harrelson would’ve been the standout of the film if it weren’t for Zoey Deutch, who plays Madison, a character that Columubs and Tallahassee meet along the way. As Tallahassee notes, zombies will not kill her since she doesn’t have any brains. The “dumb blonde” stereotype is one that has been portayed countless times in films. It’s a trope that can, and does, grow tiring. Here, Deutch adds so much charisma to an otherwise throwaway character. As much as she will make viewers cringe from her “valley girl” persona, she willalso make them die of laughter from her seemingly meaningless remarks. 
Unfortunately, Little Rock is the most insignificant character of the film. Her performance is fine, but the writers fail to give her much to work with throughout the film. She is simply used to advance the plot. As a result, she spends the majority of the film away from the main crew, depriving her of the hilarious back-and-forth banter that make this series worth watching. Her departure is what initiates the rest of the protagonists to go on their adventure. She adds next to nothing interesting to the film. A prolonged subplot between her and a stoner is the least interesting part of the film, making you wish that the film would cut back to Wichita’s snarky comments or the 70th rule that Columbus lives his life by.
Watching Columbus, Wichita and Tallahassee on the road to find Little Rock is the most entertaining part of the film, as this is where the in-your-face violence and character banter hit a consistent pace. Luke Wilson and Thomas Middileditch’s introduction as identicals to Tallahassee and Columbus slows down the pace. The jokes don’t go any further than, “Wow, isn’t it hilarious that Middleditch and Eisenberg are both scrawny nerds who follow too many rules?” It’s another case of a well-thought out idea that quickly burns out and how a film loses interest when it strays away from its protagonists.
“Zombieland: Double Tap” is not the sequel that audiences were clamoring for but the end result is a film that knows what it is: A fun action-comedy with characters we enjoy being with. This is not an allegorical tale about how society treats groups of people. This is not a film that demands to be seen as soon as possible, but if you do end up watching “Double Tap,” you’ll be genuinely delighted.

The Downtown Los Angeles Film Festival, founded in 2008 as a non-profit volunteer-based organization, is holding its 11th festival from Oct. 23 to 27. With the main screenings held at Regal L.A. Live, alongside events in the Arts District and Pershing Square District, the festival will showcase more than 100 films with 37 features ranging from student short series to experimental short series. 
The festival’s aim is to showcase films by underrepresented groups in Hollywood like women, people of color and the LGBTQ community. 
“In a word, our festival is all about diversity,” said festival manager and Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism alumnus Greg Ptaceck. “We’re hoping that our audiences come away from their experiences at the film festival with a better understanding of other people, people who come from a different culture, ethnicity, class or gender preference.”
Among the featured films is “Lost Transmissions,” a film set in Los Angeles that touches on issues of mental health and homelessness in the area, and “Pioneers in Skirts,” a documentary about the challenges women face in their professional careers. The film will premiere on Oct. 26 at Regal LA Live at 12:45 pm followed by an Inclusion in Film panel.
“[‘Pioneers in Skirts’] follows my career as a director, but more importantly what women are dealing with in Hollywood,” said director and School of Cinematic Arts alumna Ashley Maria. “We speak to other filmmakers who are women and talk about what our common issues are.”
To address underrepresentation and gender bias in the film industry, 70% of the films featured at the festival are directed by women, hoping to correct the issues presented in Maria’s documentary. For Maria, the festivals’ efforts to include marginalized creatives help bring awareness to communities and topics that are often overshadowed.
 “We’re raising awareness to a topic that can either be looked over really fast or assuming we’re done — we get that a lot where people assume that everything is fine, and we have to remind them that no, this stuff is still happening,” Maria said. “So, the fact that DTLA is bringing the awareness to it, bringing these films and bringing the audience in to see this kind of content made us excited to be a part of it.” 
Another unique characteristic of this festival is the Q&A section that allows audience members to ask the filmmakers questions about the filmmaking process, their directive choice and inspiration directly following the premiere of the film. 
“That’s a pretty unusual film experience, where you watch a film and then you get to ask the people who created it, the filmmakers, your questions about it,” Ptacek said. “It makes it a much more interactive experience.”
A turnout of 20,000 people, most of which would be young professionals in creative industries, is expected at the screenings and events based on previous years. Karolyne Sosa, the director of programming, said she hopes that the mission of entertainment and representation can extend to the large number of attendees.
“We’re hoping to entertain our audience and have them come away with an experience because we’re building a community in Los Angeles from filmmakers,” Sosa said. “We have filmmakers from all over the world, from the US, and of course in L.A., right in our backyard. We want them to have an experience with the film that they see or be exposed to a new subject matter.”

While I love a lavish weekend brunch at Sqirl or Gjusta, or a low-lit dinner at Bavel or Majordomo, I frankly do not have the budget or the time to pursue L.A.’s upper-crust cuisine. My weekend brunches are leftover slices of pizza eaten at 2 p.m. on a Saturday, and my low-lit dinners are bowls of mac and cheese eaten in the blue glow of my laptop. Instead, I gravitate toward the late-night diners, the taco trucks, the street hot dogs consumed past midnight in a glittery, uninhabited city. Some of the best food is delegated to the nightcrawlers, the college students, the graveyard shift workers — all hiding under the guise of a 2 a.m. closing time.
In my pursuit of midnight meals, I have found myself in one part of the city over and over again: Koreatown. At some point — maybe due to its culture, maybe due to its location —  Koreatown has become a premier late-night food spot. Korean barbecue joints are more full at 1 a.m. than 1 p.m. Karaoke bars and nightclubs flood with soju, snacks and drunk patrons, all eager to extend the night until the early morning. In many ways, Koreatown feels like a daring rebel against the sleeping city.
And, while I’ll never turn down an opportunity to sit around a hot grill with mountains of bulgogi and galbi, I am more often sitting in front of a bubbling pot of soondubu jjigae, or kimchi and tofu stew, at a tofu house. 
Koreatown has not one but two locations of the popular chain BCD Tofu House, which primarily serves stone pots full of soondubu as well as other Korean classics like bibimbap and bulgogi. Go to the bigger one. It’s always more fun. 
Somehow, at all hours of the day, it’s busy. After a concert at the nearby Wiltern, or a big party night, crowds will file in after everything else has closed. Here, they are served first with plates full of banchan, small side dishes, like fish cakes, pickles and kimchi. Newcomers, especially those new to Korean food, may gasp when a waitress places a whole fried fish in front of each person, bones and all. 
When inebriated, the fried fish is both a challenge and a reward: Eat the head? Just the tender flesh? Try to eat the eyeball? Some customers will eat the entire fish, the bones a mere obstacle, without a moment of hesitation. I am not one of those customers. 	
In a way, the whole fried fish represents much of the experience at BCD Tofu House. Will you crack the uncooked egg into your boiling pot of soondubu and watch it cook as the soup cools? Will you crack it into hot rice and mix the stew in with it? Will you break up bites of hot broth and kimchi with pickles or fish cakes? Will you finish your meal with the rice porridge made out of the stone pot your rice was served in? 
BCD Tofu House offers no answers to these questions but simply presents them as options. The soondubu itself is hot and satisfying, with smooth pieces of soft tofu mixed with kimchi, sometimes with protein or vegetables, always boiling hot and served with fluffy rice. Combined with the banchan, BCD Tofu House is a perfect mix between drunk food and health food, satisfying and colorful enough to please even the most inebriated. With two locations mere feet apart, BCD has successfully conquered the Koreatown late-night food scene. 
Though my fragile budget and class-littered schedule doesn’t always permit a food-centric lifestyle, BCD Tofu House is a cheap, delicious 1 a.m. option. At least once a semester, usually more, I find myself sitting in front of a table of banchan, waiting for my stew, tired but happy all the same.

Eleven of 15 parents charged in the college admissions scandal were hit with a third indictment Tuesday in Boston federal court. The parents, who plead not guilty in April, were charged with conspiracy to commit federal program bribery by bribing USC employees to gain their children admittance to USC as false athletic recruits. 
Eleven of 15 parents charged in the college admissions scandal were hit with a third indictment Tuesday in Boston federal court. The parents, who pleaded not guilty in April, were charged with conspiracy to commit federal program bribery by bribing USC employees to gain their children admittance to USC as false athletic recruits. 
Those charged include Lori Loughlin, Mossimo Giannulli, Gamal Abdelaziz, Diane and Todd Blake, Elisabeth Kimmell, William McGlashan Jr., Marci Palatella, John Wilson, Homayoun Zadeh and Robert Zangrillo.
Former USC senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel was also charged with conspiring to commit federal program bribery Tuesday along with two of the seven other athletic officials from other universities named in the college admissions case. She was charged with conspiracy to commit racketeering in March.
Wilson, who is the CEO of a private equity firm and whose son was admitted as a water polo recruit in 2014 but withdrew from the team his first semester, was also charged with two accounts of substantive federal programs bribery because of his efforts to secure admission to Harvard and Stanford for his two daughters. He allegedly paid $220,000 to facilitate his son’s admission to USC and $1.5 million to facilitate his daughters’ admissions to Harvard and Stanford, according to documents from the FBI investigation.
Wilson, McGlashan Jr. and Zangrillo were additionally charged with wire fraud and honest services wire fraud for using bribery and other forms of fraud to obtain falsified standardized test scores and gain their children admission to elite colleges under false pretenses. McGlashan and Zangrillo each allegedly paid $250,000 to facilitate their children’s admittance to USC as a false football recruit and a false crew recruit, respectively. 
Zangrillo subpoenaed USC in July for records related to “special interest” applicants, applicants whose families donated more than $500,000, involved University personnel and records of communication involving his daughter. USC asked the judge to quash the subpoena in August.
The parents named in the college admissions case were initially charged on one account of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud in March. Out of the 33 parents named in the first indictment, 16 parents pleaded not guilty and were then additionally charged under a second indictment with conspiracy to commit money laundering in April. 
Former Pimco executive Douglas Hodge and former California food executive Michelle Janavs, who both secured admission to USC for their children as fake athletic recruits, pleaded guilty Monday for fraud and money laundering following warning from federal prosecutors that there would be a third charge. Parents Manuel and Elizabeth Henriquez also pleaded guilty Monday and were not charged.
Conspiracy to commit federal program bribery can result in a prison sentence of up to 10 years, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the resulting gain or loss. A person can be accused of federal program bribery for bribing an employee at an organization that receives at least $10,000 in funding from the federal government and receives something of $5,000 in value in return. 
USC did not respond to request for comment in time for publication.
