Standing in the shadow of the tower cranes working on the new Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center, junior Zach Manta pointed out how USC undertook a multi-million dollar construction project while the campus lacks basic renewable energy infrastructure.
“We have the technology to take advantage of solar energy — that makes sense,” said Manta, an environmental studies major. “Somehow, USC doesn’t think that it makes sense.”
USC’s Environmental Core held the University’s first ever solar rally, a public demonstration aimed at alerting the administration of the need to install solar panels on campus last Friday. Starting at 11 a.m., demonstrators convened in the University Religious Center courtyard to listen to speeches from Manta and faculty advisor Josh Goldstein.
Opening remarks by Goldstein, an associate professor of history and East Asian languages and cultures at Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, emphasized that it’s the University’s responsibility to use its sizeable endowment for the good of the environment.
“Universities should be responsible for spending money and not just making money,” Goldstein said.
The group of 20 students and faculty members then marched down Trousdale Parkway before assembling around Tommy Trojan, holding signs proclaiming “Solar Just Makes Sense” and chanting slogans such as, “This is the hour for solar power.” The demonstrators then made their way to Bovard Auditorium, standing directly outside the office of President C. L. Max Nikias, where student organizer Ethan Bialick, a senior majoring in business administration, read aloud a letter to Nikias, urging the president to take action.
“Climate change is one of the largest and most complex problems in human history,” Bialick read. “As Provost Quick pointed out in his installation speech, USC is one of the ‘few institutions of higher education [that has] the breadth’ to address this problem in a significant way.”
The event, organized by Manta and Bialick, has been a year and a half in the making, according to Bialick. He and several other students began researching solar power, communicating with the Office of Sustainability and bringing in solar energy consultants in an attempt to understand what it would take for USC to implement solar power on campus.
“We did all the research, but we need USC to take action,” Bialick said. “We want to be meeting directly with the administration — we want to be working with them, not against them. We’ll keep pushing with bigger and bigger activism until we can actually talk about building a solar plan.”
The demonstrators aim to convince Nikias and other administrators to implement a system that would generate 10 percent of the University’s electricity from solar panels on campus by 2020. Currently, the University does not utilize solar power at all, a fact that event organizers contrasted with the solar power initiatives of schools such as Stanford, Harvard and UCLA. Bialick stressed the feasibility of switching 10 percent of the University’s electricity from fossil fuel to solar power sources, and highlighted the need for USC to take this initiative due to its prominence in the Los Angeles community.
“Ultimately, we will be able to displace some of the fossil fuels that we’re using right now with solar [energy], but I think the biggest impact is in showing that we’re a leader,” Bialick said. “It’s a message to the students, the staff [and] the faculty that this is reasonable [and] that it can happen because the University did it.”
Students taking part in the demonstration, including sophomore Roberto Perez, agreed with Bialick and Manta, stressing the need for USC to embrace sustainability.
“I think it’s ridiculous that USC has no solar power at all, so I think it’s about time for us to at least ask the administration to install solar panels,” Perez said. “I think it would be a good step forward, not only making USC more sustainable, but setting the example for other universities and for other businesses around the area.”
Eventually, students hope to see solar panels on buildings such as the Galen Center, the Lyon Center, the Carol Little Building and numerous parking structures around campus.

University administration responded to a study showing a 305.8 percentage increase in administrative employees at USC, arguing that the data may not accurately reflect administrative staffing. The administration is currently looking into the data released by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting in a 2014 study.
Todd Dickey, senior vice president of administration, commented on the staffing increase. Dickey said that the way the government classifies employees changed in 1990, so the data may not portray staffing levels accurately.
“Regardless, USC has grown over the past 25 years,” Dickey said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Our healthcare enterprise expanded as USC acquired hospitals and clinical practices, increasing administrative and clinical staff who are not on faculty. The increase in university staffing also includes new researchers and their laboratories, centers and institutes, which require more staff to ensure the highest levels of academic research.”
According to the U.S. Department of Education, a university administrator is someone whose work “is directly related to management policies or general business operations of the institution,” which includes employees working in a range of capacities such as marketing, food services, residence and health services.
Dickey said the University also hired additional staff to support the $6 billion fundraising initiative.
“This fundraising — achieved with an improved cost-to-dollar-raised efficiency — helps generate additional support for faculty, students and academic programs,” Dickey said. “However, the University is always looking for ways to streamline costs by reviewing appropriate staffing levels, with a careful eye towards maintaining or improving academic service levels.”
Why not start by paying adjunct professors properly before adding more and more layers of bureaucracy? USC is not meant to be a business but a community of learning.

Despite Campus Cruiser’s new app, students say they prefer USC Uber for late night transportation.
According to Director of Transportation Tony Mazza, however, USC’s partnership with Uber has neither diminished the role of Campus Cruiser nor negatively impacted the amount of students hired as drivers for the program.
“The staffing required to manage the operation puts us in the position to hire students all year long,” Mazza said.
Transportation expanded its program with Uber in the area around the University Park Campus for the Fall 2015 semester. Uber’s collaboration with the Campus Cruiser program began last semester to ameliorate concerns over long wait times during peak hours of the safe-rides service.
The original pilot program offered free Uber rides to USC students, faculty and staff Thursday through Saturday night from 8 p.m. until midnight, when Campus Cruiser wait periods exceeded 15 minutes.
“The University Affairs team brought up the extension to administration in an initiative to support student safety every night,” said Maariyah Patel, co-director of University Affairs for the Undergraduate Student Government. “We realized that peak hours for campus cruiser include after midnight and supplementary Uber services would really help USC students.”
Now, free Uber rides within Transportation’s service boundaries are available nightly, from 7 p.m. until 2 a.m., in an effort to further supplement Campus Cruiser services.
Margaret Hong, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering, said she favors using Uber.
“It’s easier than Campus Cruiser because you don’t have to call them and you just have to use the Uber app,” she said. “Usually it comes faster than Campus Cruiser.”
Catherine Bedoya, a freshman majoring in political science, echoed Hong’s sentiments.
“I have used [Uber] with my friends and by myself,” she said. “I think it was really awesome. It is so much easier [than Campus Cruiser], and I’m more familiar with Uber because I have used it outside of campus. The drivers were really friendly. We were three people. There was no waiting line, and we were not waiting for too long.”
Mazza noted that Uber has done a great job of developing their technology and effectively supplementing the Campus Cruiser program to meet the increased demand of safe rides within the USC boundaries.
“The app and technology we are using within Campus Cruiser provides a similar automated dispatch system,” Mazza said.
The app used by the Cruiser workforce ensures that it stays within its target wait time of 15 minutes.
In order to access free rides through the program, students must sign up with Uber through their USC email addresses and enter the promo code “USCFALL2015,” which adds the USC button to the Uber app.  All requests made via the USC button, within the designated times and location boundaries, are UberPool trips, a carpooling feature that matches riders traveling along a similar route.
The demand for safe transportation at USC is astounding, according to Mazza, who said that Campus Cruiser and Uber combined provide over 17,000 rides per week — a need that could not be supported by the Campus Cruiser program alone.
Campus Cruiser has also made a concerted effort to improve the program’s efficiency and accessibility with the creation of a “USC Campus Cruiser” mobile app. Addressing concerns of long wait times and difficulties calling for a cruiser, the Campus Cruiser app is an effort to make it easier to request and track locations of cruisers. Additionally, it allows members of the USC community to request rides either online or on their smartphones nightly, from 6 p.m. until 2:45 a.m.
“Students are no longer tied to waiting on the phone to set up their request [with Campus Cruiser],” Mazza said. “The smartphone and web applications enable students to request their ride virtually from any location. This, in conjunction with the Uber program, ensures all students can get a safe ride home.”
Unfortunately, students without smartphones or other web-enabled mobile devices will be unable to utilize the Uber and Campus Cruiser apps. However, Patel said that the Campus Cruiser call number is still readily at students’ disposal.
“Campus Cruiser will always be the primary option to accommodate students who do not have access to mobile applications,” Patel said.

An overabundance of modern American restaurants can be found along the USC perimeter and in the immediate area. Students typically venture outside the campus area to experience a taste of the diverse dining options Los Angeles has to offer. Just a few blocks west of campus is Revolutionario, a treasure trove of Latin American-influenced North African cuisine that’s not only delicious, but also affordable and healthy.
Originally a pop-up stand in Koreatown that gained an enthusiastic following, Revolutionario is headed by Susan Park and Farid Zadi, who opened the restaurant near the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Normandie Avenue. The restaurant offer a range of food from tacos and burritos with homemade tortillas cradling North African fillings to ceviches with Japanese-Peruvian influence. The place is sparsely decorated, with the exterior-facing window asking people to “Join The Food Revolution” and the interior walls scattered with humorous printouts of famous world leaders stating their support of tacos.
Zadi welcomes customers to his family’s restaurant as if it were his own home. Formerly a chef consultant and culinary instructor, he has a friendly personality and also knows how to cook up a fusion storm. Park, who has a background in the hospitality and food industry, found the space on Craigslist and followed her gut, knowing that the location would be a draw for diners and locals wanting delicious, affordable food. Their spot in Exposition Park attracts the diverse community surrounding USC. Revolutionario is a global experience, from entrance to the restaurant to a belly-filled bliss. Among the most popular items at this North African taqueria are the tacos, filled with meats and vegetables seasoned with numerous spices and rubs from around the world.
For the protein addicts, at Revolutionario the meat-to-tortilla ratio is enormous and will keep customers satisfied. Their smoked lamb is rubbed with a North African spice mixture and red harissa, a hot chili pepper paste. Smoked for four to six hours to deliver a heavily tenderized meat, the lamb avoids being spicy and packs a savory punch. Another favorite meat choice is the beef barbacoa. Like all of Revolutionario’s meats, this taco is a juicy bite marinated in tomatillo salsa and chermoula, a North African cilantro pesto. Despite the heat that continues to defy the fall season, the restaurant offers a goat and pumpkin tagine for the fall and winter. Goat, commonly used in North African cooking, is slightly sweet by nature, so they complement that with the sweetness of the pumpkin braise. Adding a bit of chili powder to provide a spicy and sweet balance, the combination goes hand in hand, and better yet, hand to mouth in traditional taco style.
The vegetarian options are also popular among both meat-eaters and vegetarians. Park explained that their falafel taco is a riff on the West African black eyed pea fritter akara, a mixture of black eyed peas, chickpeas and red beans married with cilantro, parsley, garlic, onions and an African spice mixture. The falafel is perfectly crisped on the outside, giving way to a light and creamy interior. Keeping the falafel airy and balanced with moisture, this lends itself well to a texturally pleasing and delectable taco. The cauliflower is seasoned with the restaurant’s North African spice mix and cooked until it has just enough bite to provide substance while still maintaining a tender texture that sits well in the tortilla. Claiming it is the North African version of huevos rancheros, Park explains the shakshouka is made with sweet peppers, tomatoes and onions with an egg scrambled in. Though breakfast-like in concept, this dish is perfect for any time of day.
The garnishes to put atop the tacos are another way Revolutionario globalizes its menu. The kimchi curtido blends Asian, African and Latin American influences to create this spicy pickled cabbage topping. North African cuisine favors pickling, and their pickled radish is no stranger to their restaurant. Both garnishes offer the perfect bright contrast to the savory meats and vegetables, creating a perfect balance for these dishes.
As far as the name of the place goes, Park and Zadi have a passion for a food revolution.
“For all the food abundance in America, there is not a lot of good food at the lower cost point. People can get a nutritionally complete, delicious meal made under $10 here,” Park said. “Everybody needs affordable, delicious food.”
Priding themselves on being the first chef-driven fast food restaurant, this family is in the business of change. With the variety here and a price point to make a wallet sing, Revolutionario is for anyone wanting unbeatably delicious food.

In the world of the electronic dance music industry, as in almost every other industry, there is a significant gender disparity. All of the top billboard DJs are male, including Tiesto, Martin Garrix and Avicii, presenting an important issue regarding the women of the EDM world.
Not only are the female DJs of the EDM scene some of the most interesting and exciting, they are also huge pieces of the industry puzzle. Women of the EDM industry have participated in expanding the industry, transforming it from a cult following to the mainstream world phenomenon it is now.
When I spent my semester abroad in London, I discovered the huge influence of electronic music among millennials. Not only is dance music an incredibly popular genre within the British musical narrative, it also focuses on a history of EDM that is not gender specific. In fact, one of my favorite DJs is a U.K.-based rave lady named Annie Mac. She is famous for her work with BBC, curating several shows highlighting leading artists, events and international influences in dance music. She also has a spot called “Annie Mac Presents” on Sirius XM’s BPM channel, featuring some of the most important artists in the electronic scene. Her focus on house and deep house music, especially in the British context, brings an international understanding and progressive voice to the current music scene.
Additionally, last year at EDC Las Vegas, I discovered another remarkable international force. Sydney-based DJ Alison Wonderland is a quickly rising DJ that has now inspired significant talk among the festival scenes. Having started her career by playing in Australian warehouses, she now takes the stage with major DJs such as Diplo. Her tracks include forward-thinking collaborations that speak to her eclectic but addictive style that has now infiltrated all music platforms.
Almost anyone who has any interest in dance music, or has turned on the radio in the last few years, has heard the song “Alive” by Krewella. This DJ group has been featured at almost every major festival since 2013, including Insomniac events, Ultra and Paradiso. The original group consisted of a trio, headed by the Yousaf sisters and their producer Kris Trindl. These girls became some of the most interesting people in the EDM scene, experimenting in the styles of hardcore, dubstep and trap. To this day, I have very rarely heard of a female-headed group that so singularly defines the “harder” styles of dance music. The sisters, aside from live performances and album recordings, released their “Troll Mixes,” which include hour-long remixes of some of the top dance tracks.
Furthermore, the song “When Love Takes Over” by David Guetta and Kelly Rowland, which also won a Grammy, was backed by a female EDM duo known as Nervo. These Aussie girls have influenced the industry both on stage as DJs and behind the scenes as writers and producers for some of the top artists of today. They have teamed up with popular dance artists like Afrojack and R3hab to produce some of the most popular dance hits such as “Revolution.” Not only have they been the masterminds behind many of the dance hits in circulation, but they have also taken the festival scene by storm since 2013, performing at Tomorroworld, EDC UK and Road to Ultra.
A woman with real power in the industry is Amy Thomson, manager of Swedish House Mafia and leader of their powerhouse career. Starting her career in the famed London club Ministry of Sound, Amy has constantly pursued the ideal of electronic music in keeping with the trends of dance culture. Not only has she helped some of the most famous artists rise to fame, but she has also brought light to the ambition and innovation within the industry of the genre.
These ladies have shown that DJing and one’s influence in the music industry go far beyond pressing play on a sound system. Female power in the music industry is always going to be a challenge, especially considering the male-dominated world of production and management. However, these women, along with many others, are transforming the industry by infiltrating the production, genres and lyrics that are the base of all dance music. Female DJs help bring a consciousness to politics, industry and gender equality that can continue to help break down barriers for all future female music titans.

On Sept. 25, the USC Symphony Orchestra performed a concert of cherished symphonic poems at Bovard Auditorium. Under the lead of conductor Sharon Lavery, an orchestra of more than 60 musicians played a program ranging from German Romanticism to 20th-century Americana-inspired melodies.
The program opened with Richard Strauss’s tone poem Don Juan. The composition premiered in Weimar, Germany in 1889, though it remains a symbol of fin-de-siècle (end of the century) modernist music. The orchestra sounded well-balanced, the strings swelling deliciously with all the extravagant lyricism that Strauss writes in the climax of the piece.
Lavery is very precise in her conducting, and her musical choices were both scrupulous and intelligent. This meticulousness might have been a little too mathematical for Strauss; there was some emotional detachment between herself and the music. Regardless, the orchestra played at a caliber that was on par with professional musicians.
Tim Richardson, a master’s student majoring in viola performance, said that this performance was rewarding in many ways.
“My favorite piece [of this concert] is Don Juan,” Richardson said. “I’ve played this piece many times, and though it’s definitely the most challenging, it’s also very satisfying.”
The program was followed by Aaron Copland’s Appalachian Spring, in which the composer drew heavily from American folk music in the Pulitzer Prize-winning composition. Originally paired with a ballet of the same name, the work now typically stands alone as an orchestral suite. The woodwinds began delicately, contrasting with the jovial nature of the recurring melodies of the Shaker folk songs that Copland references throughout the composition. The orchestra finished the suite gracefully.
The evening concluded with Gershwin’s jazz-infused “An American in Paris.” The piece, which premiered at New York City’s Carnegie Hall in December 1928, was inspired by the composer’s visit to the French capital. The piece is whimsical and lively, though the orchestra incorporated depth into the rather lighthearted arrangement. Additionally, the horns deserve recognition for not overpowering the rest of the orchestra.
Richardson, who is one of two principal violists, praised Thornton School of Music for providing invaluable opportunities to students.
“USC Thornton has made me a well-rounded musician,” Richardson said. “We’re playing repertoire that we would play in a professional orchestra and are getting real world training with all of these opportunities.”
All USC Symphony Orchestra concerts are free and open to the public. A calendar of future performances can be found online.

In a surprising and sweeping policy move, the Los Angeles City Council declared a state of emergency for the homeless in Los Angeles, promising to devote $100 million to finding tangible solutions to the alarmingly increasing homeless population. And while it’s easy to get swept up by the bold political promise, advocates for the homeless should remain skeptical about the plan’s ability to sustain reduced homelessness.
On one hand, Los Angeles City Council seems to be on the cusp of cutting-edge policy for low-income Angelenos, when coupling their latest initiative with their decision to raise the minimum wage to $15 earlier this year. And it’s commendable that the City Council, on a symbolic level, is making homelessness a priority.
But the political motivations of City Council cast doubt on the sustainability of a true initiative to eradicate homelessness. Considering that Los Angeles was officially chosen as a candidate for the 2024 Olympics less than a month ago, it’s suspicious that the City Council chooses now to unveil its big homelessness proposal. If City Council wants to clean up the streets just for the Olympics, the plan may be less of a long-term solution and more of a band-aid to cover a gaping hole.
More importantly, though the dollar figure looks impressive, the plan might not be enough. The $100 million pales in comparison to the $41 billion that New York City plans to spend on affordable housing in 10 years. And we should not overestimate the impact of $100 million or underestimate the size of the impenetrable twisted knot that is the issue of homelessness in Los Angeles. As advocate Alice Callaghan told the Chicago Tribune, “a hundred million dollars won’t even buy all the homeless pillows.”
Moreover, the city already spends an estimated $100 million on the homeless — albeit mostly in enforcement. So though it’s smart to reallocate this money to prevention, it’s not particularly groundbreaking.
Most of the plan’s effectiveness can be evaluated not from the sticker tag, but from the details of the plan which have yet to be announced. If the plan has similar goals to Mayor Eric Garcetti’s homelessness plan — to expand housing, treatment and service options — it will do some good, but probably not enough. It just doesn’t take into account all the factors that accrue into long-term homelessness.
Most notably, Los Angeles cannot attack the homelessness problem without realizing its race problem. Half of the homeless in Los Angeles are black — even though this demographic only accounts for approximately 9 percent of the city’s population. And though a lack of affordable housing creates an acute issue of homelessness and poverty, especially for communities of color, comes overwhelmingly from a school-to-prison pipeline, a biased criminal justice system, poorer education standards and a lack of local job opportunities. The City Council should accompany its plan with solutions to these bigger structural issues — it can start by decriminalizing homelessness by repealing its June ordinances which allow officials to confiscate the belongings of the homeless.
Though City Council’s decision to allocate $100 million to homelessness puts the issue on a public agenda, let’s not rejoice just yet. Such funding can be the beginning of a sustainable anti-poverty movement, but it must be spent effectively. For those of us who would desperately like the streets around USC to be a little more accomodating to its homeless: It’s a good time to be optimistic — but don’t hold your breath.

Last Tuesday, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced a plan to introduce $100 million to remedy the growing homeless population in Los Angeles. Along with City Council members, Garcetti declared a “state of emergency” on the issue. Though many have questioned this new initiative, Garcetti’s plan targets the problem at its core, providing more affordable or free housing to help Angelenos living on the streets.
Since Garcetti took office in 2013, the homeless population in the city has grown by 12 percent. Additionally, every month, it is estimated that 13,000 Angelenos become transient. There is no question that the issue is a pervasive one that the city needs to fix. However, critics have questioned the plan’s vast budget, which includes an additional $13 million set aside for emergency purposes. The mayor and his council team have also yet to release the specific details of this plan to stop homelessness in Los Angeles once and for all.
Whatever the case might be for dissent, this new plan marks a huge symbol for reform. For the first time, City Council has created a dialogue about the underlying problems of homelessness and the city government’s role in rectifying the situation. Their involvement includes creating more city dwellings for the homeless population and enforcing shelters and churches to stay open for longer periods of time. Social services and support centers would also be available for the destitute population. Moreover, Garcetti vowed that all commercial establishments would match the $15 per hour minimum wage requirement.
As exhibited by past urban areas that have focused on targeting their homelessness problem, this plan allows for more supportive, transitional forms of housing. In San Jose, where the number of homeless people tops national lists, the city’s plan to allocate funds and resources to construct housing projects saw a 14 percent reduction in its homeless population. A similar Housing First template used in Utah achieved the same results and actually saved taxpayers money in the long run. These cities, along with Los Angeles, have identified that the root of the urban homeless problem is the surging housing prices putting people out of their homes.
Additionally, Garcetti’s plan matches the National Alliance to End Homelessness’ outline for effective solutions. These 10 essential steps include plan, data collection, emergency prevention, systems prevention, outreach, shorten homelessness, rapid re-housing, services, permanent housing and income. Among this list, Garcetti’s brief plan already matches all of the requirements for a more holistic method to stop homelessness. When more specifics of the plan are released, even more ground should be covered. For now, the breadth of Garcetti’s proposal is a sign of optimism for the city.
Ultimately, the homelessness problem in Los Angeles isn’t just a government issue; it’s a community issue. A walk around USC’s perimeter is a clear indication that there should be more sympathy and engagement with the people often classified as second-class citizens. It’s our job, in the face of massive gentrification, to make sure that everyone surrounding USC is covered.
Mayor Garcetti’s proposition might be premature, but as of late, it seems like the most direct way to correct the homelessness issue. But that’s just the first step.

Sophomore forward Sydney Johnson leads the team with four goals on the season after scoring the first goal in the Women of Troy’s 2-1 win over Oregon State on Saturday. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The women’s soccer team began Pac-12 play with a 2-1 win over Oregon State on Saturday. Their record improves to 6-3-1 on the season.
Sophomore forward Sydney Johnson scored her fourth goal of the season, a team best, just before halftime to give the Trojans a 1-0 lead. Redshirt junior midfielder Reilly Parker crossed the ball to Johnson who headed it into the net in the 44th minute of play.
Sophomore midfielder Nicole Molen led the team with seven shots on goal on the night and scored a goal in the 59th minute. Senior forward Jamie Fink took a shot that Oregon State goalie Bella Geist deflected and Molen was there to put the deflection in the net to take a 2-0 lead.
In the 85th minute, the Beavers countered with a goal of their own to come within one goal of the Women of Troy, but USC held on to the lead. Goalie Sammy Jo Prudhomme had one save on the day to keep her team ahead and secure the win.
The Women of Troy will continue Pac-12 play this week with a match against Washington State on Thursday and a match against Washington on Sunday.

I thought USC was going to lose Saturday night. For the first time in my life as a Trojan fan, I came into a game expecting the football team to lose. No matter who the Trojans were facing off against, I have always thought USC would win. After last week’s Stanford loss, my confidence in the program’s direction, like many fans, was severely shaken. After last night’s victory, I am happy to have been wrong.
Now this is not to say all is right with the USC program and that the Stanford loss was a blip. I think Saturday’s victory over the Sun Devils was partially attributable to the fact that USC faced a vastly overrated squad. At the end of the day, though, a win is a win, and a much-needed one for USC. It was pretty early to have a must-win game on the schedule, but Saturday night’s tilt against the Sun Devils definitely qualified.
The Trojans won in convincing fashion against Arizona State, going up 35-0 at halftime and maintaining a significant margin throughout the entire contest. Though the offense looked stagnant at times in the second half, it’s hard to maintain focus when you are blowing the other team out. The win wasn’t beautiful as the Trojans looked sloppy at times, but the sheer amount of talent on USC’s roster was evident as the game wore on.
Hopefully as the season progresses, the coaching staff can harness this talent, reduce the penalties and turn the Trojans into the team everyone was expecting this preseason.
On offense, Adoree’ Jackson has to get the ball every game. He might be the most explosive player in college football, even as LSU tailback Leonard Fournette breaks new records every Saturday. Jackson’s balance and instincts are incredible on their own. Couple that with his    world-class speed, and it is no wonder he seemingly makes a big play every time he touches the ball. His long touchdown catch was a great play, but the two more impressive moves by him were his complete change of direction on the punt return and shedding four or five tackles on the screen pass.
In addition to Jackson, receiver Juju Smith-Schuster continues to impress. The Arizona State game started with another long connection from Cody Kessler to Smith-Schuster, and it seems he has developed into a bonafide deep threat this year. Smith-Schuster offers the complete package as he has always been physical after short catches, churning away for extra yards. Now that defenders have to respect the deep ball, it gives him more space to work with underneath. The long drag routes across the middle of the field have been impossible to cover for defensive backs this year, and, hopefully, the Trojans continue to press this advantage.
Jackson and Smith-Schuster were not the only skill position players to impress, as senior quarterback Cody Kessler turned in another stellar performance. His ability to avoid hits in the pocket and keep plays alive paid major dividends against the Sun Devils as it extended multiple drives. Additionally, it was nice to see Kessler flash the athleticism that made him a standout high school point guard, as his mobility is often underutilized.
Additionally, the defense responded well after the shellacking at the hands of Stanford last week. They attacked the ball and made plays happen. While the line was gashed up the middle on plenty of runs, overall the defense had a much better game plan in place. It’s amazing what happens when the Trojans blitz and put pressure on the opposing quarterback; they either throw it away or into a defender’s hands.
All of these signs are positive, but it is way too early to tell if Arizona State is a truly quality opponent this season. Outside of ASU quarterback Michael Bercovici’s incredible performance in the last five minutes of last year’s game against USC, he has been barely above average as a                             Pac-12 quarterback. Add on the 14-point swing as a result of Arizona State’s goal line fumble, as well as the ensuing turnover on the kickoff, and it’s hard to know how much of the game was due to the Trojans’ talent or the Sun Devils’ ineptitude.
Regardless, it is a victory and a much-needed one. As the Trojans take some time to rest during the bye, it must be a welcome relief to be 3-1 and not 2-2. It was only a few years ago that a shaky Trojans team went into a must-win game against Notre Dame, and as it looked like the Irish were starting to gain momentum, former safety Jawanza Starling took a bad snap to Notre Dame quarterback Dayne Crist and returned it 99 yards for a touchdown. After that game, the Trojans pulled off an upset against Oregon and beat UCLA 50-0. Here’s hoping that Chris Hawkins’s fumble recovery can bring about a similar mojo for this year’s squad.

The No. 19-ranked Trojans bounced back from last week’s loss to Stanford in a dominant fashion, blowing out Pac-12 South foe Arizona State 42-14 on the road in Tempe, Arizona.
The rout not only gave the Trojans their first conference and road wins of the season, but it also produced their first victory over the Sun Devils since 2012 — finally avenging two of the program’s toughest losses in recent years.
“In all three phases, I’m just proud of the guys,” Sarkisian said. “They played a really good football game, and they came right off the bat ready to go.”
USC (3-1, 1-1 Pac-12) was able to jump out to a 35-0 lead heading into halftime behind four passing touchdowns by redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler, who continued to substantiate his Heisman Trophy campaign by throwing for 375 yards and five total touchdowns, though he did throw his first interception of the year.
Arizona State (2-2, 0-1 Pac-12) struggled to put the ball in the end zone against USC, largely in part to its inability to take care of the ball. USC capitalized off four Sun Devils first half turnovers that resulted in its 28-point second quarter explosion.
“Last night as a team, I probably went on a 30-minute barrage of about how to create turnovers and how we want to play defense and just getting after the football,” Sarkisian said. “It was so cool to come out tonight to get four of them.”
The Sun Devils were knocking on the door of USC’s one-yard line before quarterback Mike Bercovici fumbled a hand off that would be recovered and taken 94 yards to the end zone by redshirt sophomore safety Chris Hawkins.
On the subsequent kickoff, the USC special teams unit was able to force another fumble that set up a 10-yard passing touchdown from Kessler to sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster to cap the team’s scoring barrage. The tandem also connected earlier in the quarter for a four-yard touchdown pass.
Smith-Schuster, who is currently third in the nation in receiving yards with 434 on the season, broke out for over 100 yards receiving for the third consecutive game.
Do-it-all sophomore Adoree’ Jackson also dazzled when he transitioned from defense to offense on Saturday night.
“He’s pretty good,” Sarkisian said. “The hardest thing about dealing with Adoree’ is when and how and how many times, and it’s a challenge because he’s so good in all three phases.”
Jackson racked up 131 receiving yards on just three connections from Kessler including an 80-yard touchdown in the first quarter that gave USC an early 7-0 lead. The three-way player also broke out for a sensational 45-yard catch and run that took everyone off of their feet, as he broke tackles and sped by defenders down the sidelines.
“Even when he’s not getting the ball, everyone’s aware of it on defense, and I think it just speaks volume to the type of player he is,” Kessler said.
The Trojans wouldn’t look back after that, as Kessler would next find redshirt sophomore wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. for a 27-yard passing touchdown early in the second quarter to put USC up by two scores.
Redshirt junior wide receiver Issac Whitney also got into the scoring action with a 10-yard touchdown reception in he fourth quarter — USC’s lone score of the second half.
The Sun Devils would eventually get into the end zone late in the third quarter on a one-yard touchdown run by running back Demario Richard, who punched in Arizona State’s only other score as well. Arizona State’s ground game was the team’s bright spot, as they compiled 182 rushing yards on the night.
Bercovici struggled in the passing game for the majority of the night, completing only 23 of his 44 passes while throwing for 272 yards and an interception. He was picked off by sophomore safety John Plattenburg, who recorded the first interception of his career.
While USC was able to improve its third down efficiency, converting 10 out of 16 times when it needed to move the chains, penalties continue to plague the Trojans.
The team tallied 10 penalties for 91 total yards against the Sun Devils, more than they accrued during last week’s loss in their conference opener to Stanford.
“[We’ve] got a little time now to kind of prepare for some bumps and bruises and then get ready for a stretch here that’s going to be tough,” Sarkisian said.
Going back to last year, USC is now 5-0 coming off a loss from the previous week.
“I think that we’ve got a resilient team,” Sarkisian said. “The key is to take this game and then build from it.”
The Trojans now enter a bye week, where they will have a chance to rest before returning to the Coliseum to take on Sarkisian’s former team, the Washington Huskies, on Oct. 8 in a Thursday night affair.
