Growing up visiting my relatives in upstate New York during the summer, we would frequently go see the Auburn Doubledays — the local minor league baseball team. Sitting in the bleachers at those games, I’d often see the same little boy wearing noise reduction ear mufflers at every game. 
I didn’t understand it at the time. I had only ever seen construction workers with power tools wear those before. But when I recently learned that the Philadelphia Eagles opened up a sensory suite at Lincoln Financial Field for fans with sensory challenges and their families, I thought of that boy. 
The suite is essentially geared toward young fans with sensory processing disorders like autism or PTSD. It’s equipped with noise canceling headphones, verbal cue cards, fidget tools, weighted lap pads and much more. Beyond that, Eagles and Lincoln Financial Field employees have been trained to “recognize guests with sensory needs and … quell sensory overload situations.” 
The Eagles aren’t the only NFL team to take this step. At the Buffalo Bills’ New Era Field, fans can rent sensory inclusion bags free of charge from any Guest Services booth, making the stadium a “certified Sensory Inclusive space” this season. The bags contain materials similar to those at Lincoln Financial Field. 
Sports accessibility goes beyond simply having handicap-accessible seating in stadiums. There are families all over the country with children or adults living with sensory challenges. These new accommodations allow those people and their families to experience the joy of going to a sports game with less strain.
It should be celebrated that NFL teams are making strides toward a more inclusive game experience while also normalizing these needs. All other sports teams should take note. 
Part of why billions of people across the world enjoy being a fan and going to games is that it provides a sense of community and aids social integration. Studies have found that suicide rates temporarily dip every year around Super Bowl Sunday and the final game of the World Series. These are times when people typically gather to watch games and feel a sense of belonging. 
Sports are often seen as a common ground for everyone. I’ve even heard the phrase “everyone speaks ball.” But sports, often known as the one thing that unites the world, can be ostracizing. Even beyond the challenge of loud stadiums that can be overwhelming for people with autism, not everyone feels welcome in the sports community. 
Let’s talk about a more surface level topic. When I first transferred to USC, I struggled to find people to go to football games with. I remember feeling so friendless knowing that everyone else was at the game in groups, and I didn’t even have someone to walk with me to the stadium. I felt like I couldn’t go to the Coliseum and sit in the student section by myself, and I know I’m not the only one who has ever felt that way. 
Too many times, I’ve watched people get embarrassed when someone quizzes them on their sports knowledge and they get labelled as being “not a true fan” when they fail. For one thing, you don’t have to know everything to be a fan and a part of the community. Rather than shaming people for what they don’t know, let’s instead make them excited about how cool sports can be. For example, if you find out that someone doesn’t know who Matt Barkley is, don’t say, “What? You’ve never heard of him?” Say something like, “Oh you’ve gotta look him up some time, he’s awesome!”
I’ve strayed a bit from my opening thoughts on the progressive new things the Eagles and Bills are doing, but my point is that sports can be inaccessible or overwhelming to some. To others, the sports community can simply be intimidating. Sports seem very inclusive on the surface, and in general they are — but they can also feel isolating when you’re on the outside. 
As college students, we don’t necessarily have the means to help design sensory suites at major stadiums, but there are still things we can do to welcome others into the sports community.
If you mention an upcoming USC game to an acquaintance in your class and they seem a bit awkward about it, encourage them to come with you and your friends. I know if someone had done that for me three years ago, it would have meant the world. If you mention the recent Dodgers loss to someone and they seem confused, they might not follow baseball or might not have grown up in a family that follows sports at all. Rather than shaming them, even unintentionally, briefly fill them in in a way that’s not condescending. 
Monumental steps like Sensory Inclusive stadiums are awesome, but even modest changes can make a difference. We can make sports inclusive in more ways than just how we equip stadiums. From now on — and especially this football season — let’s all make an effort, no matter how small, to welcome everyone into the special community that is the sports world.

Coming off their bye week, the 3-2 Trojans will look to rebound from a sloppy loss at Washington against a talented Notre Dame team currently ranked No. 9 in the country. 
This year’s edition of the storied rivalry looks once again like an unbalanced affair between a potential College Football Playoff contender in the Fighting Irish and an unranked and unsettled USC, but there’s a lot at stake for both teams going into the matchup. The Trojans desperately need to avoid a second straight loss, and the Irish will need a win to keep their playoff hopes alive. Add in the fervor of one of college football’s best rivalries, and you’ve got a recipe for an interesting Saturday.
USC Offense vs Notre Dame Defense
The return of freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis gives USC’s offense a massive boost. As the passing performance against Washington showed, Slovis’ ability to make quick reads and deliver an accurate ball are integral to the success of the Trojan offense against capable defenses. 
Though the freshman still has plenty of issues to work through, he’s a talented and intelligent passer, and with an array of weapons at his disposal, he should be poised to produce against a Notre Dame defense that may be vulnerable against the pass. Although they’ve been statistically stout for most of the season, the Irish have been shredded through the air against solid opponents like Virginia and Georgia. 
The loss of graduate cornerback Shaun Crawford only makes matters worse for the Irish in that area, especially against a Trojan offense with so many dangerous weapons in the passing game. Senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. currently leads the Trojans in receiving, and a favorable matchup could set him up for a big night. 
Notre Dame’s pass rush is perhaps the unit’s greatest strength, spearheaded by star senior edge rusher Julian Okwara, but the Trojans have been strong in pass protection all season long. Dominating through the air is likely USC’s best chance to win this game; the pass game will have to produce at a high level for the Trojans to pull out a win. 
The ground game looks a little more dicey, as the up-and-down USC rushing attack will be pitted against a Notre Dame defense that has shut down the run games of two opponents over the past three weeks. It’ll be a tall task for the Trojans to be as productive on the ground as they were against the Huskies.
Notre Dame Offense vs USC Defense
Senior quarterback Ian Book has been fantastic for the Fighting Irish thus far. Book can do it all — he’s a smart passer with a strong arm, great awareness and dangerous mobility. He’s been the engine that drives the Notre Dame offense, and he’s done it with incredible efficiency, throwing for 13 touchdowns to only two interceptions and posting a 65.5 completion percentage. 
Much like Washington, the tight end position plays a big role for the Fighting Irish, so the Trojans will be tested in the passing game across the middle. Luckily for USC, its young secondary has been solid and steadily improving over the past few contests, and the return of sophomores safety Talanoa Hufanga and cornerback Olaijah Griffin will provide a significant boost to the unit. So long as the Trojans generate pressure consistently, they’re primed to be able to counter the Notre Dame passing game. 
On the ground, the Irish have been solid all year, but the return of junior running back Jafar Armstrong could shake things up significantly. Armstrong is an explosive playmaker, but he has missed almost the entire season due to an abdominal injury suffered Week 1. Armstrong will suit up this Saturday, and Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly has said he hopes for the back to play around 20 snaps this week. USC has often been vulnerable on the ground this year, and a strong day from Armstrong and company could be too much for the USC defense to bear.
Prediction: 35-28, Notre Dame
Despite the apparent disparity between the unranked Trojans and No. 9 Fighting Irish, these teams match up fairly well against each other. Notre Dame is still the better team on paper, but this Trojan squad is plenty capable of going toe-to-toe with them. 
USC should be motivated to avoid back-to-back losses and a slide to 3-3; I wouldn’t be shocked if the Trojans pull off the road upset against their rivals. This could be a much more intense game than many assume. Nonetheless, home field advantage in South Bend is huge, and the Irish should be able to hang on for a victory if they execute properly.

Just because it’s midterm season, doesn’t mean you can’t have fun. Take a night to yourself and go to a concert!
L.A. is rife with opportunities to see rising artists showcase their talents in creative ways — here are a few shows where you can see just that.
We Are KING — Oct. 12 @ Ford Theatre
Paris and Amber Strother, twin sisters comprising We Are KING, will showcase their music, accompanied by an orchestral ensemble.
With a Grammy nomination under their belt for their self-titled 2016 album, the Los Angeles-based group from Minneapolis has already earned vast critical acclaim. Oct. 12, they will bring their talents to the outdoor venue in the scenic Hollywood Hills.
Hello Yello — Oct. 15 @ The Wiltern
Oakland-based trio Hello Yello will open for rising pop star Clairo at The Wiltern Oct. 15. The group comprises frontman Dylan, a 23-year-old singer-songwriter and producer, his brother Jaden, who plays bass, and their friend Martin,  who is on the drums.
The visual for their single “Feel That Again” from “Love Wins,” their debut EP, stars Aramis Hudson from North Hollywood skate collective Illegal Civilization. “Love Wins” showcases the group’s sonic range. Infusing elements of punk and grunge with emo and hip-hop, the project refuses to conform to a single genre.
Plus, the venue is just four miles away from campus.
Slow Hollows — Oct. 24 @ Moroccan Lounge
This show will be particularly special for L.A.-based group Slow Hollows — just a day after the group drops its new album “Actors.” The forthcoming album will feature their latest singles “You Are Now On Fire” and “Heart.”
The group’s frontman, Austin Anderson, is perhaps best known for his collaborations with Tyler, the Creator on “Cherry Bomb” and “Flower Boy,” as well as his contribution of the chorus on “Self Control” and Frank Ocean’s “Blonde.”
Sports Team — Oct. 29 @ Moroccan Lounge
Sports Team, a six-piece band from across the pond, will stop by Los Angeles on its first full-length U.S. tour. Fronted by the charismatic Alex Rice, the band formed at Cambridge University, where its members were all students.
The tour will follow the release of their forthcoming “Making Hay” EP. Slated for Oct. 18, the five-track project will begin with Sports Team’s latest singles “Fishing” and “Here It Comes Again.”
Sports Team will play the same venue that Slow Hollows will a few nights earlier — the Moroccan Lounge which is less than a mile from Union Station in downtown.
G Perico — Nov. 22 @ Regent Theater
Nov. 22 @ Regent Theater
A South Los Angeles native, buzzing rapper G Perico grew up not too far from campus and is making a name for himself with his contemporary take on G-Funk, the signature style of the West Coast.
Perico recently followed last year’s EP “Guess What?” with his Roc Nation debut “Ten-Eight” which features singles “Number 1” and “Big Raccs.”
He will perform at the Regent Theater, located near the Pershing Square Metro station, just one stop from the 7th St/Metro Center station, the Expo Line’s last stop.

Monday night, I went to see the highly-anticipated origin story of everyone’s favorite criminal mastermind — Joker. Starring Joaquin Phoenix as failed Gotham City comedian Arthur Fleck — a mentally ill man isolated, ostracized and rejected by society — “Joker” follows Fleck’s descent into madness. The movie, which sold $93.5 million in ticket sales its opening weekend, sparked intense controversy, bringing in mixed reviews and polarizing public opinions. 
According to Variety, “the overall consensus seemed to be that even if the film was too dark and violent to truly enjoy, Phoenix’s performance alone was worthy of Oscar recognition.” I’d like to add a similar sentiment: Not only did I overwhelmingly enjoy the film, but I also think it was one of the most insightful and significant movies of the year. 
I agree that “Joker” makes viewers uncomfortable — in fact, discomfort was at the crux of my viewing experience. Phoenix made me squirm in my seat and made my skin crawl; he made me feel disgusted and distressed as he pulled us into his darkness. But I don’t think that’s where the widespread sense of “discomfort” is rooted. I think it is rooted in the fact that evil is not parsimonious — meaning, the simplest answer is not always the best one — and I think a lot of people have a really hard time reconciling that. I think, when it comes to the bad guys (both real and fictional), it is easy and convenient to categorically vilify them. On the other hand, to see the bad guys as three-dimensional and nuanced, as real human beings — that’s where the challenge lies.
“Joker” is a testament to the fact that people do not emerge from a vacuum — even the ones that do terrible, unimaginable things. Fleck’s downward spiral was part genetics, part shitty environment and part simple bad luck. While his life is set in the fictional city of Gotham, there is no lack of real-world social commentary. His story speaks to the cycle of abuse and the consequences of lax gun laws in the United States — a disastrous domino effect set into motion by inadequate government health services that abandon the poor and the mentally ill. When you consider that serial killing spiked in the ‘70s and ‘80s, the pattern feels even more telling. By the time Fleck turns to violence, you may be appalled by his choices, but you see the inevitable progression that leads up to them. It feels grimly formulaic.
“Joker” effectively breaks down the mechanisms of how individuals so disillusioned with and enraged at society reach their breaking point — specifically, in contemporary America. While Fleck’s character isn’t representative of the vast majority of people with mental illness, he is representative of a small yet culturally significant demographic. No one is asking you to excuse or even sympathize with a serial killer but to see how some of them come to be. To start unraveling the mess of factors into identifiable triggers and signs. To understand that oftentimes, the fate of people like Fleck can be co-authored by their environment. 
For those who have seen the film, let me ask you this: Is Arthur Fleck mad or bad? Victim or murderer? The abuser or the abused? Or is he both? It’s not such a simple question when it is put into absolute terms. 
At the climax of “Joker,” when Fleck is a guest on Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro)’s talk show, he screams in anger, “You never think about what it’s like to be the other guy.” That line made me sit back and pause; I found myself reflecting on the fact that we are now more than ever submerged in a culture of “us vs. them.” And I reject the notion that simplifying or straw-manning the Other will make it any easier to understand them. I think we can all benefit from the nuance and multidimensionality, the film imparts. I think we can all benefit from thinking like “the other guy.”
At its core, “Joker” is a movie about the human experience — a rare and decidedly awful one, sure, but still a human experience. The Joker doesn’t have super powers or special gadgets: He is weaponized by a dark past and a lot of rage. This was more than just the origin story of a supervillain; it was also the origin story of many real-life criminals — the faces we see on the news and wonder, “How does someone become that messed up?” “Joker” is a film that is beautiful in its ugliness and eye-opening in its lurid starkness — like a trainwreck that you can’t look away from, no matter how badly you want to.

Zac Coughlin, a junior majoring in communication, has launched a new business with a sugary twist. 
Zac’s Sweet Shop is the latest online venture that delivers unique and custom-made treats at your doorstep. Featuring a wide array of cookies, truffles and cookie pizzas, customers can customize their dessert experience by selecting items that go into their boxes.
Although the website just launched, Coughlin started the company when he was 13 years old in his home town of Pittsburgh. While looking at potential desserts to bring for a party, he realized that none of the desserts offered were unique. This led to Coughlin wanting to make something special for his friends.
Coughlin said he purchased basic ingredients like strawberries, chocolate and pretzels and put his own unique spin on it, both through visuals and taste. That difference was how Zac’s Sweet Shop was born. 
“I just wanted to take them to another level … Everyone was like, ‘Where did you buy these from?’ And I was like, ‘I made them,’” he said. “And then weirdly enough, a month or two passed by, and it was just kind of like a fun hobby in a sense but also like, I thought I was potentially onto something. Like no one was really doing chocolate dipped desserts like that and stuff like color schemes … Even Godiva didn’t do anything in terms of that much color.”  
Eventually, Coughlin believed he might be onto a growing business. Coughlin saw that there was an opportunity to make dessert an experience for people rather than just another dish  to consume. 
Coughlin said he did a lot of research into the types of dessert he could make. He knew that if he was putting all this effort into his work, he had to make sure he did it right the first time.  
“I convinced [my mother] to let me start it,” he said. “It was a family and friends business for years.”
Once the business started gaining popularity in his hometown, Coughlin decided to take what he thought was a much needed break while at USC. During this time off, he had the opportunity to explore different interests. 
One of those interests was social media, which her explored through Reach, a student social media organization where he learned the ropes of how to market a brand online. 
Although there were many initial difficulties with establishing his business in the USC area, Coughlin said he was able to apply what he learned in his classes and through Reach to make it a reality. The demand for his desserts from previous customers, along with advice from important people in his life, helped him realize that he needed to make the jump and make Zac’s Sweet Shop happen. 
Coughlin also threw himself into his coursework, as he knew that the topics discussed in class were directly relevant to his business and  would help him succeed.  
“I took two years off of it to really focus on school and see if the sweet shop was still something I really wanted to do,” Coughlin said. “It’s not like I didn’t want to do it by any means, but I was just literally across the country for college.”
Cosette Rinab, a junior majoring in public relations, is a fan of Zac’s sweets. She said she has been an avid supporter of Coughlin and has encouraged him to pursue his passion of making desserts. Rinab has seen the business take off from seeing Coughlin running it at school to experiencing the final product that it has become. 
“There’s nothing like this online right now,” Rinab said. “I mean, not only is it a very fun, colorful new dessert shop, but it’s so innovative in the way the website is so interactive. Like you can design your own cookie pizza by dragging the toppings on. It’s really something like I’ve never seen before.”

At age 17, Neysa Sanghavi was the youngest person to volunteer with the United Nations in Rwanda at its Mahama refugee camp in 2017. While at the camp, she researched health issues like malaria that refugees dealt with and searched for potential solutions.
Sanghavi, a sophomore from India majoring in human biology, had visited Rwanda earlier that year and worked with the non-profit Avegha-Agahose, which supports women who lost loved ones to genocide through provided housing and therapy. 
Her first visit instilled in her a desire to make a difference in the country. Through multiple visits, Sanghavi vowed to make people more aware of Rwanda and its culture. She started The Study Rwanda Project as a way to change people’s misconceptions about it and find solutions to improve business and healthcare. 
Sanghavi’s determination impressed high officials in Rwanda. Ernest Rwamucyo, the high commissioner of Rwanda to India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, named her the honorary designation of the Rwandan Brand Ambassador for India at just 17.
Sanghavi’s interest in Rwanda started in high school when she read “Things Fall Apart” by Chinua Achebe, a book about Nigerian culture and its history of colonialism. After reading the novel, Sanghavi knew she wanted to learn more about how literary portrayals of Africa compared to the continent’s reality. 
“I decided that I wanted to go see this for myself because I don’t want to believe in people’s stereotypes,” Sanghavi said.
Monday, Sanghavi traveled to Rwanda for the YouthConnekt Africa conference, where she was invited by Rwandan President Paul Kagame to speak about her work as a volunteer and as a brand ambassador promoting tourism and investment in the country. 
As a brand ambassador for the country’s tourism, Sanghavi meets investors to guide them to available resources for investing in Rwanda and works with nonprofits and tourist organizations to provide a more holistic view of Rwanda.
However, Sanghavi said she dealt with multiple obstacles while serving. She said she faced opposition from her relatives in India, who considered Africa dangerous and also had to deal with people’s ignorance as they asked her if she had ebola or was HIV positive for spending time there.
The women Sanghavi worked with at Avegha-Agahose told her they didn’t want their country to be remembered for the genocide of the 1990s, during which nearly 800,000 people died within 100 days. Instead, they wanted to work to change its image. 
“They gave me [a] sense of purpose in my life because I realized what I’m interested in and what makes me happy,” Sanghavi said. “My focus shifted from what makes me happy to what makes my community happy and I don’t think I would have had that approach in my life if I was not part of Rwanda and did not interact with these widows.”  
For her work at Mahama refugee camp, Sanghavi wanted to understand refugee health issues. Her research took place for a week and a half as she observed the conditions of the camp and learned about its daily functions, including how the refugees dealt with malaria and put on skits to convince the Burundi refugees of the effectiveness of allopathy medicine. 
“[The position of brand ambassador] was something  I was very proud of achieving but at the same time my next immediate thought was how am I going to be able to use this to be able to do what I want to do,” Sanghavi said. 
After her experiences in Rwanda, Sanghavi wrote a book in December 2017 called  “Rwanda On The Rise,” which recounts her visits to Rwanda.
Karin Huebner, academic director of the Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Studies, said she has kept a copy of the book in her office since she met Sanghavi during her freshman orientation. Huebner said she was impressed by Sanghavi’s passion.
“She has one of those extraordinary empathetic reactionary sensibilities,” Huebner said. “She is really [one of the most] extraordinary students that I’ve had in all my 20 years of being at USC.”  
Sanghavi’s work has led her to meet and share her work with dignitaries like Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi and Indian industrialist Ratan Tata. She is currently working on a project with a private tourism company on voluntourism for Rwanda and hopes to keep working for the country. 
“Over time I’ve realized that more than me doing anything for the Rwandans, they did a lot for me because I ended up growing as a person and actually got interested in things I never thought I would be interested in,” Sanghavi said.  
Ariana Licea, a sophomore majoring in creative writing, is Sanghavi’s roommate and said that even remotely, Sanghavi manages her different commitments. 
“She’s been inspired by the Rwandan people to really be able to help them and embrace them and not only that, but to represent them in a way that’s beyond what we would perceive them as,” Licea said. “They are advancing in a way that’s really powerful, beyond our perception, and she is representing that and sharing that with the world.”

Trumpets blasted and cymbals clashed as Selene Castillo walked among the other student representatives across Alumni Park last month. She sported a black and red robe, but it wasn’t her graduation day — she was taking part in Carol Folt’s inauguration as USC’s 12th president.
As she held the wooden rod of the Bovard flag in her hands and stood around the fountain, watching faculty and staff roll in and listening to the announcer, Castillo could barely contain her excitement. She had just started her first semester at USC a month before, and she was already representing her cohort of Bovard Scholars, a feat she never would have imagined a few years prior.
“The previous night, I was talking to my mom, and I was telling her about how I would have never imagined that,” Castillo said. “I was telling her, imagine I was born — we’re from Mexico — and the doctor telling her, ‘You know what? Someday your kid is going to be at USC.’”
Castillo, a freshman majoring in international relations, considers herself lucky. 
She’s a Bovard Scholar, a Norman Topping scholar and one of the only students from her high school in Thermal, Calif., to attend USC in the last few years. But her successes are not simply accidents — they’re a compilation of years of hard work and sticking to her goals.
“A lot of our kids, you know, the day it gets hard, they quit,” said Gustavo Sandoval, Castillo’s high school anatomy and physiology teacher and baile folklórico instructor. “Selene is just that rare type of kid that she thrives on the pressure. It’s like, if it wasn’t hard, it wasn’t fun for her. And the other thing is, she never gave up.”
Now in college, her goal remains the same: to pay her family back for the sacrifices they have made since coming to the United States. Castillo remembers the long days her mom would work in the fields and the summers she would spend picking grapes in the 120-degree heat alongside her.
Castillo also recalls her junior year of high school when her grandmother fell ill. She was back home in Guanajuato, Mexico, when her grandmother was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  Castillo and her family would not be able to see her before she passed away. Castillo and her parents are undocumented, so making the return to Mexico would be permanent.
“At the time, my dad would say [to my mom], ‘You know what, I don’t care. We’ve been here for so many years. It’s OK if you leave. If you want to do that for your mother, it’s OK, we’ll leave,’” Castillo said.
But her grandmother made her mother promise not to leave. And it’s a promise that has kept Castillo going. As the oldest of four, she is the only child without papers. Her three younger siblings are all citizens, but Castillo was born in Guanajuato, a home she left when she was 2 years old.
“It’s like that promise that my mom didn’t leave because of me — there’s no going back for me. I just have to keep on pushing forward,” Castillo said, her voice cracking.
And her hard work has been recognized.
“Just to hear how much she’s accomplished, so much, it’s just gratifying as an educator,” Sandoval said. “It makes you feel like you’re actually doing a difference because the biggest thing for educators is, ‘Do we impact somebody?’ And here’s someone that I can tell you that we had an impact on her. And I know she’s going to have an impact on a bunch of people as well.”
For Castillo, coming to USC was a bit of a culture shock. Though she’s a resident of El Sol y La Luna, Fluor Tower’s Latinx floor, there are not as many Latinx students on the floor as she expected.
“I come from Coachella Valley, so we’re all Latinos,” Castillo said. “My high school is 99.9% Latino. Our teachers are jamming out to Mexican music from class to class, like it’s paisa, it’s Mexican, Mexican. Being here is a totally different atmosphere. Talking to other friends on the floor and just comparing music taste and stuff is just — I’m in another world.”
Castillo misses switching back and forth between English and Spanish, using Spanglish words and translating for her family and acting as an interpreter for parents at school.
“It’s just a few people that actually speak Spanish to me on the floor,” she said. “Sometimes I catch myself speaking in Spanish, and I have to apologize and translate it to English. So, for me, that’s really hard. It’s something that I have to overcome.”
For Castillo, the most important part of her journey has been helping her brother and two sisters aim high so that doors continue to open for them like they did for her. She’s especially happy to see her own motivations rub off on her second-grade brother Emiliano, the youngest, whose excitement about the future matches  Castillo’s. 
Emiliano has followed in her footsteps quite literally, as he has taken up baile folklórico just as Castillo did throughout middle and high school and has already set his sights on college.
Castillo couldn’t help but smile as she recalled his reluctance to leave her dorm room on move-in day. As her mother helped her set up her bed, Emiliano defiantly told with her about how he was going to move in with Castillo, and there was no one who could stop him.
“If I can’t change the world, at least I know I changed his mentality, and I’m happy,” Castillo said.
Getting to USC wasn’t easy for Castillo. She said that the counselors at her high school did not provide much help or resources for students applying to four-year universities like USC. But Castillo’s main support came from the Bovard Scholars program, which she discovered accidentally when she sat down next to a friend at lunch and saw the program’s flyer among his belongings.
“She’s so bright, she’s so eager,” said Jennifer Colin, the executive director of Bovard Scholars and summer programs, who works with Bovard Scholars like Castillo. “And then she has this added personal mission, which really comes through when you talk to her. She is glowing about inspiring students to our summer community and showing them life outside of the valley and really encouraging them to see beyond their immediate circumstances.”
Outside of class, Castillo’s main release is baile folklórico. She has danced since seventh grade, when she wandered into a high school dance group after learning about it from a woman at a conference she attended at school. This is a passion Castillo continues to pursue 100 miles away from her usual dance floor. 
USC’s Grupo Folklórico was the first thing she looked for when attending the campus involvement fair in September. Now, a few afternoons a week, the space in front of Heritage Hall becomes her studio. She’s exhilarated as she dances, empowered by bailes like el jarabe tapatío of Guadalajara, Mexico. The bailes provide a bridge between her passion and her daily life.
“She’s resilient,” Castillo said. “In the dance, she has to stomp as hard as the guy, she has to manage the faldeo and do all these things at the same time. I feel like that’s what I’ve been doing, just like balancing all these things at once but trying to be resilient and trying to have that smile on my face and push through the pain.”
As Castillo looks toward her next few years, she’s not quite sure what to expect. All she knows is that her next steps will be rooted in her culture and the values she’s grown up with.
“Soy Mexicana de corazón,” Castillo said. ”I’ve always been super in touch with my culture. And that’s why I do baile folklórico, and that’s why I like to speak Spanish. And it’s something that keeps me connected and reminds me every step of the way, who I am. I’m a DACA student and I’m from Mexico.”

We are in the midst of the infamous “midterm season,” where students swarm libraries and study spaces in a frantic attempt to finish their various assignments. Between tests, assignments and papers, students have an overwhelming amount of academics to tend to and complete. On top of that, students also need to maintain their composure despite the overwhelming pressure. This sometimes proves to be difficult because, frankly, life is not easy. However, a certain kind of therapy might help take the edge off for students.
Think about the perks of having a dog. Current or previous dog owners most likely have a laundry list of things to say about their dog. Starting with the obvious benefits like cuddling, protection and friendship, there are more essential perks like support, safety and assistance. Many of us have seen or heard of Professor Beauregard Tirebiter—more commonly known as Beau. 
Beau is the University’s first full-time canine faculty member, frequently circling USC’s campus to encourage wellness among fellow faculty members. Beau is a professionally-trained dog and is very beneficial to students in terms of mental health and well-being, but one dog is really not enough. Students need to be exposed to more than one dog during their time in college because this exposure can improve mental health and relieve stress, which is helpful even if it’s only temporary. 
Obviously, it is not reasonable to suggest that every college student should go and rescue a dog. They cost money with veterinary fees, food and other needs — not to mention the time that one must afford to ensure the dog frequently exercises and maintains a healthy lifestyle. Most students do not have time to add another responsibility to their plate. But that should not stop us from bringing more dogs on campus for students to temporarily engage with, to distract from the overwhelming life of a college student. One does not need to own a dog in order to reap its benefits — dogs just need to be made more readily available and seen by students on a more frequent basis than the occasional Beau sighting. 
Several organizations like Diamond Dogs at Temple University are can bring dogs to campus and are even established solely for the purpose of easing stressed students. Kent State University has a program called Dogs on Campus where dogs come to campus during stressful times such as finals week or midterms. 
These dogs need people too, because they may come from traumatic backgrounds and need a companion. A relationship that is beneficial to both the student and the dog is capable of distracting from the sometimes overwhelming college lifestyle.  Not to mention that dogs are easy to talk to, which is what a student may need to decompress after a long day.
Sometimes, random events include dogs specifically for petting and each time this happens, a multitude of students gather to enjoy these cute pups. Dogs have been proven to alleviate a variety of stress symptoms experienced by students. According to the Mental Health Foundation, dogs are proven to lower levels of stress and anxiety. Furthermore, walking a dog gives a person a sense of companionship and forces the person to enjoy a walk, rather than stress over an assignment or test. If the University could put more effort into getting rescue organizations or shelters to bring dogs to campus for students to interact with, then it could help both the dog and the person. 
If events like these existed, it is also possible that a student might end up adopting a dog they felt a connection with, or at the very least temporarily create a relationship that is beneficial to both the dog and the student. This alleviation of stress for a student can be life-altering. All of these possible situations are beneficial for both parties and can only lead to a better atmosphere on campus. Dogs contribute a unique sense of comfort and companionship to humans. They are able to love unconditionally. They simply show their love with pure action, yet unfortunately do not live as long a life as a human being. This forces people to witness an example of something living and loving while they can, because everyone should really be reflecting the behavior of a dog — unconditional love while they can.

Reggie Bush’s NCAA-mandated disassociation from USC will end after the 2020 season, interim director of athletics Dave Roberts announced in an interview with TrojanSports.com Wednesday. 
The Division I Committee of Infractions recently reduced any disassociation to 10 years, said Roberts, who sits on the committee, an NCAA administrative body charged with deciding infractions cases involving NCAA-member institutions and their employees. 
Bush was a star running back on USC’s football team from 2003 to 2005. In 2005, Bush won the Heisman Trophy after rushing for 1,740 yards and 16 touchdowns. Over three seasons, he rushed for 3,169 yards and 25 touchdowns while leading USC to a BCS National Championship victory in 2004. 
USC was forced to disassociate itself from Bush in 2010 after the NCAA handed down major penalties to the school following a 2006 investigation by Yahoo Sports. The investigation found that Bush had received illegal benefits from marketing agents while at USC. 
As a result of the penalties, USC had to vacate the 2004 championship and Bush forfeited his Heisman trophy. The school also received a two-year bowl ban, a reduction of 30 football scholarships and was required to erase Bush’s name and likeness from campus and official records. USC also had to refuse him sideline access to practices and games. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, Bush had voiced his willingness to return to USC back in April. 
“I would be lying to you if I said I didn’t want to go back and be a part of the school,” Bush told the Times in April. “I love USC.”
According to the same story, USC has tried on three separate occasions to have Bush’s disassociation removed. 
“USC has long said that we would love to have Reggie back around campus but the NCAA has mandated the school permanently disassociate from Reggie,” Sports Information Director Tim Tessalone said. “If we did so, it would lead to further NCAA penalties. We have tried several times to appeal the permanent disassociation with no luck. We would love to have him back.”
Despite the COI’s rule change, the decision to reassociate itself with Bush will ultimately be up to USC.
“So in June of 2020, the disassociation for Bush will expire and it’s going to be up to the University what the University wants to do” Roberts said.
