The Undergraduate Student Government Senate passed a resolution Tuesday against deferring greek rush. This came as a response to the Faculty Senate recently passing a resolution advocating for students not to participate in greek rush until they earn a USC GPA. The senate floor, jam-packed with dozens of members of the greek system, proved that the idea of deferment had become quite unpopular on the Row.
Sen. Jacob Ellenhorn spoke in favor of the resolution. Ellenhorn, who himself has not been involved in greek life, said that deferred rush was a means of limiting the freedom of students.
“I don’t have a personal story to share with you guys. I didn’t get involved in greek life because that was my choice,” Ellenhorn said. “The Academic Senate and the Graduate Student Senate pushing this idea of deferred recruitment … what they are really pushing is trying to take choice away from our student body, and that is unfair.”
Ellenhorn explained that if students were “smart enough” to get into USC, then they would be fully capable of making decisions on how to spend their freshman year.
“And deferred recruitment makes absolutely no sense,” Ellenhorn said. “They’re saying that you can’t be stressed in the fall, but you can be stressed in the spring. I don’t really understand that.”
Some of the concerns of the faculty resolution were that fall recruitment would have a negative impact on the GPA of incoming freshmen. Alex Keane, vice president of recruitment for the Interfraternity Council, explained that since 2010, the all-greek average GPA has been higher than that of all undergraduates, with the exception of one semester. He also mentioned that fraternities include 297 presidential and trustee scholars.
“Being the vice president of recruitment, I already saw that the numbers are up since years previously. This is one of the best rushes we’ve ever had, with over a thousand guys coming out for recruitment,” Keane said. “We’ve been raising the standards significantly over this period of time.”
Keane said the wording of the Academic Senate resolution confused rushing with pledging, which he said shows of a lack of understanding for the process. He explained that those involved in its drafting had not consulted Keane or his fellow directors on how the greek system works.
“All new members, while they’re pledging, are required to have hours within their fraternity where they have be there studying,” Keane said. “This is four hours a week, and literally everyone is in a room, and I’m walking around making sure they’re doing homework.”
Another issue raised was the notion that greeks were unfairly being targeted. Present students pointed out that other intense clubs and organizations, such as the Trojan Knights and the USC Marching Band, have not been subject to such intense GPA and time-commitment critiques. Sen. Eric Dubbury said that students can be subject to stress in other areas besides greek life.
“I chose over my last four years to do over 23 different organizations, internships [and] I worked three jobs. I know what it’s like to hustle and burn the candle all ends,” Dubbury said. “I don’t think anyone on the greek system knows that any less than I do.”
Dubbury argued that though some greeks might be dealing with academic issues, the academic or graduate senates should not be putting shackles on what greeks can and cannot do. Dubbury, who has been part of the marching band, confessed how that had also been a huge time commitment, with 40 to 50 hour weeks, on top of schoolwork.
“A lot of people in the marching band have probably the same issues that people in the greek system do. Especially their freshman year, they are juggling a lot of commitments, the traditions, going through their first year of marching,” Dubbury said. “But if marching band was in the spring, it would be no better than if it was in the fall. If football was in the spring, it would be just as bad.”
Dubbury explained that what the marching band did to address academic issues — and what, in turn, the greek system has also done — is have the members support each other, offer resources, put them in touch with academic counselors and have tutors on buses on their way to games.
“We made it work because we worked as a team,” Dubbury said.
The resolution passed unanimously, with surprisingly little opposition.
After this discussion, the Senate voted against the resolution that called on USC to join the Syria Consortium of the Institution of International Education. The majority of senators said that though they supported the goals expressed in the resolution, they did not think the USG Senate was the proper vehicle for advocating on this type of issue that could be considered politically charged.
If people in a political office won’t vote on politically charged issues like the Syria Consortium then who is going to do it? Tell me what would be the “proper vehicle” for advocating this be instead if the USG Senate ~agrees~ so much with it, but won’t act.

Closing pitch · The Spark SC organization 1000 Pitches, held its closing ceremony Tuesday evening, during which 12 winners were announced. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Spark SC, a student entrepreneurial organization, hosted the closing ceremony for their 1000 Pitches contest Tuesday in the Annenberg West Lobby.
The purpose of 1000 Pitches is to empower students to have confidence in their ideas and show that everyone can be an entrepreneur. To participate in the contest, graduate and undergraduate students from all academic disciplines were asked to submitted a video ranging from 30 seconds to three minutes with a pitch for a new product, program or idea. Each contestant had the opportunity to pitch up to three ideas. Twelve winning pitches were then chosen to receive a $1,000 prize.
Since the event kicked off on Sept. 24, Spark SC members have been setting up pitch booths across campus and encouraging as many students as possible to pitch an idea in exchange for a free t-shirt.
“The purpose of the event is to challenge the notion of what a $1,000 pitch is,” said Pooja Dhupati, co-head of the 1000 Pitches Planning Committee. “Innovation can be accessible to anyone.”
Two months and 1,127 pitches later, 60 finalists and 12 winners were chosen for their award-winning ideas in one of the 12 different categories including music, education and research. All of the finalists were invited to attend the 1000 Pitches closing ceremony.
The event started with an introduction from the co-heads of the event, Pooja Dhupati and Ben Choe. This was followed by a keynote address from Alyssa Esqueda, a senior editor at CNET TV and the host of Tomorrow Daily. Immediately after, the finalists were announced and the winning pitch videos were shown. Each of the 12 winners received a prize of $1,000. The winning innovations ranged from a virtual reality film project to showcasing student art across campus to a travel service for people who want to go backpacking across Europe.
“HostelPass is basically a premade lodging pass for anyone who goes on a Europe trip,” said Sarah Weingust, the winner for best pitch in the travel category. “You can pay up front for all of your accommodations, book what city you want to stay in the night before and have your housing taken care of by the next day. The purpose is to liberate the free-spirited traveler and allow them to be spontaneous.”
The entire contest is funded through sponsorships from various on-campus and off-campus organizations. Some of the sponsors included Microsoft, Cornerstone, Riot Games and Raytheon. Ben Choe, co-head of the 1000 Pitches Planning Committee and a member of the Iovine and Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation, began working on securing sponsorship funding in July.
“I cold called a lot of different companies and showed them other popular Spark [SC] events,” Choe said. “I talked about TechLA and the Startup Fair, but I basically had to pitch a pitch competition.”

World leaders convened this week for the COP21 climate change summit, which aims to create a universal, binding agreement among the constituent nations to address global warming. Attendees included U.S. President Barack Obama, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping — and USC alumna Harleen Marwah.
From Nov. 30 to Dec. 9, Marwah is set to lead a series of discussions titled “Desserts for the Decades” at COP21, the United Nation’s 21st Conference of Parties. COP21, which is taking place in Paris this year, aims to build a “Paris Climate Alliance” designed to keep the average global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius.
“[Desserts for the Decades] aims to be a space where we can foster the collaborative spirit needed to reach a successful agreement out of these meetings,” she said. “The conversation structure offers an opportunity for people across generations, cultures and interests to come together and realize their common ground.”
Marwah, a Washington D.C. native who graduated from USC in 2015, is the youth liaison for the Sea Trust Institute at COP21. Marwah’s work focuses on engaging younger generations in issues such as agriculture and food safety, indigenous people, climate change and intergenerational equity.
For Marwah, climate change is more than a changing scientific environment — it’s a far-reaching issue that will permeate all aspects of life.
“The impact of climate change will extend into issues of political stability, growing poverty, access to clean water, food safety and more,” she said.
From Marwah’s perspective, any significant change must come from a local effort. Due to a lack of physical boundaries when it comes to climate change, she believes that any resolution must be dynamic and accessible across cultures and communities.
Marwah’s journey at COP began when she was still an undergraduate student working toward attaining both a bachelor of science in health promotion and disease prevention and master of science in global medicine. She attended COP20 in Peru with SustainUS, a youth-led organization which advocates for justice and sustainability.
Marwah is trying to make the most of every moment at COP21.
“Hearing from 147 world leaders at the conference’s opening, including Secretary General Ban-Ki-Moon and U.S. President Barack Obama was undoubtedly a phenomenal and inspiring experience,” Marwah said. “There is an unbelievable energy pulsing through the COP21 — people from across the globe communicating and collaborating to quite literally do their part in saving the world.”
Marwah credited USC for playing a role in who she is today.
“My USC education inspired me to ‘think globally and act locally,’” she said. “So my advice to USC students is to cherish every moment and seize every opportunity. You have countless resources at your fingertips and should definitely make an effort to utilize as many as you can.”
Marwah said her journey in climate change advocacy began at USC one afternoon when her WRIT 340 class was canceled.
“Instead of going home to binge-watch Netflix, I was persuaded to attend a guest lecture,” she said. “At the lecture, I learned about the public health relationship with climate change. The next week, I was applying to go to Peru for the UN COP20. You never know what you might become passionate about. I encourage you to engage in these opportunities while you can. Your time at USC truly does fly by.”

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism received a $5 million grant from the Annenberg Foundation this week that will fund a new diversity initiative aiming to extend access to journalism resources and education for students from a broader range of socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds.
The grant, announced  Monday, will support two initiatives: Annenberg Leadership Scholarships, which will provide the annual tuition for three graduate students in journalism and communication who come from backgrounds that are underrepresented in the news industry, and Annenberg Leadership Fellowships, awarded on a yearly basis, which will allow three professional journalists to work and teach at the Julie Chen/Leslie Moonves and CBS Media Center in Wallis Annenberg Hall.
“If we want a news industry that truly understands and covers all of America, then our news industry has to embody all of America,” Wallis Annenberg, chairman, president and CEO of the Annenberg Foundation told USC News. “We have to attract the best and brightest of every race and ethnicity and economic background — we have to equip them with the most cutting-edge tools and skills so our news coverage can be just as inclusive and forward-looking.”
This initiative will also fund the expansion of the Community Reporting Initiative, a program that focuses on underserved communities. The program emphasizes digital fluency, encouraging students to use technology to discover compelling and effective ways to tell news stories.
“We are building a new generation of technologically and journalistically skilled communicators who will lead the complex digital newsrooms of the future,” Willow Bay, director of the school of journalism told USC News. “These young professionals will enrich newsrooms with new voices and perspectives, and be a driving force in informing a broader audience.”
This gift is also the latest addition to the Campaign for the University of Southern California, the University’s effort to raise $6 billion or more in private philanthropy to further its academic priorities and worldwide influence.

Man of the Year · Freshman linebacker Cameron Smith was named the Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year Tuesday night. Five other Men of Troy were named to the All-Pac-12 first team Tuesday. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Just one day after Athletic Director Pat Haden announced that interim head coach Clay Helton would take over head coaching duties permanently, five Trojans were named to the All-Pac-12 first team. Sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, sophomore cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, junior linebacker Su’a Cravens, redshirt junior offensive tackle Zach Banner and senior defensive tackle Antwaun Woods all received first team honors. Freshman linebacker Cameron Smith was named Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year.

The women’s volleyball team’s impressive 2015 season has resulted in seven players earning postseason recognition from the conference, as announced by Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott Tuesday. Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio headlines the award winners after being voted the 2015 Pac-12 Player of the Year, while Mick Haley was voted Pac-12 Coach of the Year for the second time in five years.
In addition to Bricio, senior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms and sophomore opposite Brittany Abercrombie were each chosen to the Pac-12 All-Conference Team. Receiving all-conference honorable mention status were junior libero Taylor Whittingham, junior middle blocker Elise Ruddins, freshman outside hitter Alyse Ford and freshman setter Baylee Johnson. Furthermore, Ford and Johnson were named to the All-Freshman Team.
Bricio, a senior from Guadalajara, Mexico, is the third player in school history to be named Pac-12 Player of the Year and was named All-Conference for the fourth year in a row. She is also just the second Trojan to be named both Pac-12 Freshman of the Year and Player of the Year in her career. Bricio has had a record-breaking senior campaign after winning Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week a league-record six times, becoming the first Trojan and the seventh player in league history to record 2,000 career kills, and becoming USC’s all-time leader in attacks, kills, service aces and points. In 2015, she currently leads the nation in points (6.18 pps) and service aces (0.73 saps).
Mick Haley earns his second Pac-12 Coach of the Year award in five years (2011) after leading USC to a 30-2 record this season. After going 16-16 in 2014, Haley completely revamped the offense and brought USC to the top of the national rankings after starting out ranked No. 22 in the preseason. Under Haley’s direction, USC earned a share of the conference title and the top national seed in the 2015 NCAA Tournament.
Joining Bricio on the  All-Pac-12 team for the first time are Ogoms and Abercrombie. Both players have had the best seasons of their careers, setting new marks in nearly every statistical category this year. Ogoms, who received honorable mention status last season, currently leads the league in blocks (163 total) and is second in hitting percentage (.415), while sophomore Abercrombie has burst onto the scene as one of the best right-side hitters in the conference, averaging 2.44 kills per set.
Ruddins and Whittingham have also had solid junior seasons for the Women of Troy and earned Pac-12 honorable mention. Both Orange County natives, Ruddins finished third in the conference for hitting percentage (.398) while Whittingham led the league in digs (4.73).
In their first seasons donning the cardinal and gold, freshmen Alyse Ford and Baylee Johnson were named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman team. Ford is another Orange County product and is the team’s second-leading point scorer with 2.66 kills per set, while Johnson is a six-rotation setter and hitter that ranks ninth in the league with 7.11 assists per set. The Dayton, Ohio, native is a stat sheet filler with her all-around play and leads USC with 16 double-doubles this season.
All in all, the Trojans now hold 92 all-league recognitions since 1977. After earning the top seed in the upcoming NCAA Tournament, No. 2-ranked USC (30-2) will host Horizon League champion Cleveland State (26-6) at the Galen Center in the first round of the tournament Thursday at 7:30 p.m.

Despite growing up in L.A., I was never a big Lakers fan. There were plenty of good opportunities for me to jump on the bandwagon, but I just was never that into basketball.
In fact, I would go as far as saying I disliked the Lakers. Kobe Bryant, the face of the franchise, always came off as a ball hog and was connected to some less than savory issues off the court.
But especially toward the end of his career, I’ve grown to respect him for his impact on the game, the franchise, and the city we’ve both called home for the past 20 years. Without a doubt, he’s been the most influential sports figure in Los Angeles this century.
Which is what makes the timing of his retirement and the hiring of Clay Helton as USC’s next permanent head coach so interesting. Throw in the Dodgers’ decision to hire Dave Roberts as their next manager, and you have arguably the three biggest teams in one of the country’s largest media markets all going through huge changes in identity within the same week.
The question on the mind of every Trojan fan is if Helton can handle the pressure of leading USC football and bring the Trojans back to a championship caliber that has become the expectation of any program or franchise in the City of Angels. Of course, only time will tell, but the fate of the other big sports names who have established their legacy in Los Angeles could give some valuable clues.
As much as Helton would dislike admitting it, he might now be on track to replace Kobe as the biggest name in L.A. sports. You could make the argument for plenty of others, but I think Helton wins the starring role.
With no competition from the NFL, USC is Los Angeles football. As the most popular sport in the country, it’s hard to believe there still isn’t a professional team in L.A., the nation’s second biggest media market, but the Trojans fill that void for many sports fans. Objectively speaking, USC is still one of the premier programs across college football because of its tradition of success across numerous generations. And with all due respect to UCLA, the Trojans officially won back the city title this weekend, reminding the Bruins of where their place has been in the history of their rivalry. Because college football players come and go every four years, even Heisman winners like Matt Leinart or Reggie Bush won’t hold legendary status quite like professional counterparts. Though Jim Mora deserves a lot of credit for building up UCLA to a much more competitive position, he would have to start winning multiple national championships, or move across town, before he becomes a next level big name.
On the basketball court, we have another similar rivalry, where the Lakers are clearly the alpha historically, despite a recent surge by the up-and-coming Clippers. Even though he might not have always been the face of the franchise while Shaquille O’Neal was winning MVP awards for the team, Kobe was basically just as prominent during the Lakers first run of championships, and there was no doubt who was leading the team during their second championship run after Shaq had left L.A. Blake Griffin and Chris Paul of the Clippers certainly bring back memories of the Shaq & Kobe duo, but they also need multiple rings before becoming L.A. legends.
Surprisingly, a championship has eluded the Dodgers for the past 27 years. Every Dodgers fan can recall the replay of Kirk Gibson rounding the bases after his walk-off home run that catapulted the team to the 1988 World Series title, but my generation of baseball fans still haven’t seen one with our own eyes, even as the organization has surged to the top of the NL West — and the MLB payroll totem pole. Clayton Kershaw certainly has the talent and name recognition to become a superstar, but he too needs to trade in a Cy Young award plaque for a World Series ring before he can officially get to that level. If I had to pick the most important figure in the franchise recently, I might even go with            play-by-play man Vin Scully, who, like Kobe, is also set to retire soon.
The L.A. franchise you might have forgotten that has won a title in recent memory is the L.A. Kings. In fact, the Kings have two Stanley Cup wins in the past four seasons, but hockey is still too obscure, or just too cold, for most sunny Southern California natives. Anze Kopitar might be the city’s best and most accomplished athlete, but you might not even be able to pronounce his first name (AHN-zay), let alone recognize him.
Of course, the same standard will apply to Helton. For him to achieve legendary status, to warrant a           year-long victory lap after announcing his retirement, to prompt, “Where do they go from here?” or “Who will be the next?” questions, Helton has to win, and not just the Victory Bell or even the Pac-12 South championship. The comparison between Helton and Kobe isn’t a great one, as no one will ever buy a Clay Helton jersey, but there is one comparison that will be very easy to make if Helton does win.
Behind Kobe, the next biggest name Los Angeles has seen in sports within the last two decades has to be Pete Carroll. The Lakers had two championship runs with Kobe, and other than the Kings, the only team with that kind of dominance over a period of time was the Trojan football program Carroll led. In fact, it’s Carroll’s departure that signaled the end of USC’s dominance for many fans, and the question has always been how to get the team back to that level without him.
Helton is about as far away from both Kobe and even Carroll as they come. Kobe will go down as one of the hardest, toughest competitors of the era. It’s fitting that Kobe waited until now, when injury and age have robbed him of almost all value on the court, to give up instead of going out on top with a couple years to give. Though he has progressed into a better leadership role, Kobe was the kind of guy who demanded the ball, demanded the spotlight and wanted nothing more than to be the one to beat you.
Carroll was comparable to Kobe from the sideline. He loved the rah-rah, never shying away from the media or showing his enthusiasm. Though a much more positive personality, he preached competition in all phases of preparation, maintaining that only if players were fighting for spots would they develop into NFL talent, and the Trojans almost always brought their best to big games — with one noteworthy exception.
Helton fits in much better with someone like Phil Jackson. Though maybe not a strategic mastermind or offensive innovator like Jackson, Helton definitely embodies the Zen Master mindset. He wants to be behind the scenes, put his players in the best position and just be a respectable guy that everyone wants to play for. Jackson’s mindset was the perfect complement to Kobe’s killer mentality, and led the franchise to its five titles the past 16 years.
Helton’s low-key style is also reminiscent of Daryl Sutter, who led the Kings to their two championships. Sutter’s personality is almost the polar opposite to the flashy and glitzy L.A. media, and it was the blue-collar mentality of the Kings that made them so unstoppable during their two Cup runs.
The less than flattering comparison is that I could also see Helton ending up like Don Mattingly, the recently fired Dodgers manager. He was another low-key personality, and while he put the Dodgers in a great position over the past couple seasons, they never found the spark to get it done in the playoffs, which ultimately led to his firing. I can see a world where Helton keeps the Trojans good but not great, constantly competing for the conference and national championship, but never really breaking through. It seemed like a rushed hire by Haden, who might have wanted to go with the safest option after all of the off-field issues with Steve Sarkisian without fully exploring the alternatives.
But Helton has what it takes to be the next legendary L.A. coach. He won’t be on billboards. He won’t be a household name for sports fans and non-sports fans alike. His first name won’t be sufficient to recognize him in conversation.
But he probably likes it that way, and so should ’SC fans. It’s just what it takes to be a championship-caliber coach in LA, and it’s just what USC needs. He doesn’t have to be a star; he just has to manage them.

For head coach Clay Helton and the USC Trojans, a fall from here would be a long way down. Being named Pac-12 South champions to the tune of trouncing rival UCLA caused the teams’ spirits to be immensely high during practice Tuesday as they prepared for the game against No. 7 Stanford and a chance at the Rose Bowl.
USC Athletic Director Pat Haden minimized the potential impact by labeling Clay Helton as the permanent head coach Monday.
“Besides marrying my wife and the birth of my children, this was the most special moment of my life,” Helton said. “This is the pinnacle of college football and to have the responsibility to lead it is not only the greatest challenge but also the [most] exciting thing that has ever happened to me. And I look forward to that opportunity.”
Haden and assistant coaches agree that in a season defined by changes since the dramatic departure of Sarkisian, Clay Helton has been the one constant that players have relied on, trusted and needed. And among  all of the subsequent emotions and confusion, offensive line coach Bob Connelly said that the players bought into Helton’s philosophy of playing as a family. Helton has preached that no one outside of USC’s locker room could understand what they were going through and that if they were going to survive, they would have to do so together.
“In my opinion, there is not a better guy out there for the job obviously when you look at the response of our football team after it was announced by Haden,” Connelly said. “To me, it doesn’t matter what is on the outside. What matters is the inside, and when those kids have the belief that they have for him, there is going to be something special. He is a phenomenal man and phenomenal leader. He is a great football coach, so I could not be happier for him or more proud to be a part of his staff.”
Much of USC’s success since Helton became the interim head coach has largely been attributed to the dominant play of the offensive line. Connelly says that his line has been encouraged by Helton’s mantra to run the ball and control the time of possession while doing so, which was evident against UCLA where USC had 40 minutes of possession time and rushed for 235 yards.
“When you are an offensive lineman and you are put in that position in a game like that — that is a prideful thing,” Connelly said. “Absolutely, they are excited about that, and they were very thankful that they are able to execute that game plan. There is no better feeling as an offensive line coach than when you are in a situation like we were in last week where you have to control the ball, keep them off the field and kill the clock.”
Su’a Cravens agrees that the family mentality that Helton has instilled within the team has translated into its plays on the field. He said that players feel more accountable for their individual actions for the betterment of the team and not themselves, which was evident in their defensive performance against UCLA. Cravens said this week that they are going to have to do the same, plus make their tackles, if they are going to slow down the “extremely athletic and physical” Christian McCaffrey and Stanford. Cravens compared McCaffrey to USC’s Adoree’ Jackson in that he is so versatile and dangerous with the ball in his hands. Like Jackson, Cravens noted that McCaffrey is a threat to break away and score at any position on the field but added that McCaffrey is more physical and has the ability to also run the ball inside, and they are going to have to gang-tackle if they are going to bring him down.
“I think we are just a better team all around since the last time we played them,” Cravens said. “We know our play book and we know the guys that we are working with and we trust each other after all the experiences. There were a lot of problems in the beginning of the season where we didn’t trust each other and we were trying to do somebody else’s job and make a big play instead of just trying the system and the game plan.”
Helton admitted he is not a person who is going to change, saying that the keys to defeating Stanford will be running the ball, stopping the run and winning the turnover battle as it has been all season long. But he added that today’s practice was focused on being more efficient on first and second down on both offense and defense in order to get into the third and short yardage situation so that they can extend the drives and time of possession. Helton said that third down and long situations make the team one-dimensional and expose the quarterback, but that if they can run the ball effectively to begin the series then they can open up the play action and free up receivers downfield for big plays.
Though USC lost in its first meeting against the Cardinal at the beginning of the season, Helton said that his team has changed tremendously, as they have learned to play more physical and inspired football. In that game, the USC offense watched helplessly from the sideline as the Stanford offense marched down the field controlling the line of scrimmage with an aggressive rush attack and the time of possession in the fourth quarter.
“I think that we have just got to be disciplined if we want a better shot at beating Stanford,” Cravens said. “Physicality is going to be a huge part of this game. I think that is why they beat us in the fourth quarter last time we played. They averaged like six or seven yards a carry. We have really got to stop the run. I think that we have shown that we can now.”

Located on a busy and bustling street in Marina del Rey and sandwiched between a Chinese restaurant and a chiropractor’s office, Bikram Yoga Marina del Rey proves appearances can be deceiving. As I waited to find a spot in the completely packed parking lot before class, I wondered what the studio could possibly have inside. I knew they offered quite a few classes each day, but the studio didn’t look very big from the street. I then followed what I assumed to be fellow Bikram yoga students down the back alley and into a doorway. In any other situation, following strangers down a dark alley at night is not the best idea, but I somehow felt safe with a legion of pedestrians in yoga pants.
I stepped into the studio completely shocked — what I found could only be described as a beautiful chaos. Pieces of wood bound the lobby in clean and modern lines as colorful clothing hung across from the front desk. Though the room’s design absolutely invoked a serene state, the hustle and bustle of Bikram students suggested the opposite as I had arrived just a few minutes before the start of my class. It was clear I entered the studio at perhaps the only time it was like this — students were both entering and leaving class at the same time, with two staff members at the front desk handling package purchases, rentals and release forms.
As my class instructor Kari greeted me and set up my yoga mat inside, I had a chance to briefly look over the space, which packed a lot more in than I thought. The wood-lined hallway leads to a steam room on one side for students to loosen up before class and locker rooms on the other, equipped with restrooms and showers. After checking out the studio, I made my way into the class and, needless to say, I had found where all the people had gone. Because I was in the Saturday 5 p.m. class where everyone only pays $5, I had expected the price to attract a larger and more diverse group. But the reality definitely surpassed my expectations — I was absolutely surprised at the number of bodies in the room. As I tried to find my mat in the back of the room through a sea of bodies, fighting my body’s immediate shock at the room’s heat — typical Bikram classes are ideally performed at 104 degrees, with 40 percent humidity — Kari helped guide the class closer and closer together as more students arrived. At the start of class, our mats were two inches apart from one another.
The studio states that a typical Bikram class attracts a demographic that can span 65 to 70 years, and it was right. My class held both ends of the spectrum, with a boy who looked to be about 10 years old sporting some swim trunks and as a woman who looked to be in her 70s, with all sorts of ages and bodies in between. Bikram yoga truly is for all different ages, bodies and athletic abilities.
As we began the class, starting with the breathing exercises, I became fully aware of the diversity in the room. My position in the back row allowed me the opportunity to observe others and witness all different body types moving through the positions with an ease and grace I thought I hadn’t yet acquired. After the first few poses, however, I found the heat had become my best friend and my worst enemy. The heat had both created a flexibility I hadn’t known possible, but as I’d raise my leg in the air or fold my body like a pretzel with new confidence, I would sometimes lose my grasp to the sea of sweat I was producing. With so many people in front of me, I couldn’t look into the mirror to see if the vast amount of sweat dripping from my body made me glisten glamorously like a Hawaiian Tropic model or Edward Cullen in the daylight, or if instead I looked like a sickly version of my usual self. I chose to believe the former.
Kari had warned me that I might feel lightheaded and that it was normal, but I found myself pushing harder and harder. I was in love with this new flexibility I always warned people I don’t possess and wanted to make the most of my new super powers. I sailed through what I had convinced myself were the most difficult poses, worthy only of the best and most dedicated yogis. I maintained stability through my eagle pose, transitioned my tree pose into a toe stand and kicked my bow pose so high I could see over the heads of the students in front of me. Though we moved from position to position in unison — Bikram students practice the same 26 positions every class — the class surprisingly felt less cult-like than I had expected. That was until we reached the end of our 90 minute class, when Kari led us into the last breathing exercise, and I was surrounded by what sounded like mass hyperventilation. Nevertheless, I was sincerely pleased to be a part of the class and very much enjoyed my time at Bikram Yoga Marina del Rey. By the end of class, I was drenched from head to toe in my own sweat but felt a newfound confidence I didn’t think was possible.
Created by Bikram Choudhury and popularized in the early 1970s, each Bikram class follows the same format, running for 90 minutes, with students practicing the same 26 positions and two breathing exercises every class. Kari was very diligent in explaining the health benefits of each pose as we did them, from flushing out toxins through sweat, to colon regulation and stress release. The average Bikram student can expect to lose one to three pounds of water weight per class.
Bikram Yoga Marina del Rey holds classes as early as 5:30 a.m., and as late as 8:30 p.m., seven days a week. The studio is currently providing a special introductory offer at $50 for 30 days, in addition to their membership packages for unlimited one month, three months and the whole year, at $199, $499 and $1499, respectively. For those not quite certain of their schedule or commitment to Bikram, the studio provides class cards, which students can use for classes on a more sporadic basis. A single class is $25, while the 10, 30 and 60 class cards run at $175, $450 and $750 each. The studio also rents yoga mats and towels for those who don’t have their own for $2 each, and has water, sports drinks and apparel available for purchase.

Though the weather outside in Southern California is never truly frightful, the holiday season invokes the consumption of hot beverages, particularly hot chocolate. The drink features easy-to-assemble ingredients, yet allows for a wide variety of combinations. Unlike coffee or tea, hot chocolate injects holiday spirit as everyone counts down to Christmas.
Basic Hot Chocolate
Most of the hot chocolate variations begin with a standard recipe, but the milk can be switched out for soy or almond milk for a   vegan alternative. Additionally, for those craving a richer drink, melted chocolate bars or chips can be used instead of cocoa powder and sugar.
-½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
-¾ cup sugar
-1 pinch salt
-½ cup boiling water
-3 ½ cups milk
-¾ teaspoon vanilla extract
Serves 4. Active: 5 minutes; Total: 7 minutes.
Combine the cocoa powder, sugar and salt in a saucepan. Pour in boiling water. Bring the mixture to a boil while stirring for about two minutes, making sure the combination does not scorch. Turn off heat and mix in milk. Remove from heat and add in vanilla. Divide the hot chocolate between four mugs.
Adapted from AllRecipes.
Peppermint Hot Chocolate
Peppermint, one of the classic holiday flavors, goes hand-in-hand with chocolate. Building from the basic hot chocolate recipe, gather whipped cream and candy canes. Crush the candy canes until they become peppermint dust. Top off the hot chocolate mugs with generous amounts of whipped cream, finishing off with the peppermint dust.
Sea Salt Caramel Hot Chocolate
Another flavor that pairs well with chocolate is caramel. The salt contrasts the sweetness of the chocolate and adds another element to a traditionally treacly drink. Using whipped cream again, gather the cream into a bowl. Gently whisk in a teaspoon of sea salt and the caramel topping of your choice.
Mexican Hot Chocolate
Inspired by the sweet-and-spicy combination popular in Mexico, this hot chocolate recipe features chili powder and cinnamon to liven up the drink. For those who cannot tolerate spicy foods, opt for just the cinnamon, as the spice will add heat to the drink without burning your tongue.
-1 tablespoon chocolate syrup
-1 pinch chili powder
-½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
Using the basic hot chocolate recipe once again, mix in the chocolate syrup, chili powder and ground cinnamon in the saucepan. A pepper can be used to dress the drink.
Lemongrass Lavender White Hot Chocolate
For an elevated spin, add herbs such as lemongrass and lavender to your hot chocolate drink. Though the most indulgent option in these recipes, these ingredients are actually particularly helpful in relieving stress. Though milk chocolate or semisweet chocolate also works with the drink, white chocolate is the ultimate complement to these out-of-the-box flavors.
-1 small stalk lemongrass,      chopped
-½ teaspoon lavender
-1 lime leaf, torn in half
-zest of one lime
-3 ½ cups whole milk
-3 ounces white chocolate, finely chopped
In a small saucepan, heat lemongrass, lavender, lime leaf, lime juice and milk over medium heat. Stir occasionally until bubbles form on the sides of the pan. Remove from heat and let steep for 15 minutes. Strain milk, and return mixture into saucepan. Add chocolate over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the chocolate is evenly combined.

Inevitably, students are cramming in preparation for finals, finishing massive papers, color-coding notes and studying for those pesky exams. As the pressure builds and the dreaded finals come closer, the mind can become an unhappy place. However, it’s important to make time for stress-relieving activities.
Dance to your favorite music
It might sound silly, but music has many redeeming qualities. For one, it’s simple and doesn’t take away from the task at hand. You can listen to it while preparing for school, cleaning your room, cooking or driving. Studies show that music therapy is a growing practice due to its success in stress relief.
Take a walk
After studying for a long period of time, the body can become restless. Going outside and getting fresh air awakens brain cells and makes going back to studying less challenging. Physical activity releases endorphins, which can improve your mood. As Elle Woods put it, “Exercise gives you endorphins. Endorphins make you happy. Happy people just don’t shoot their husbands.”
Have a good laugh
Laughing is extremely beneficial to your body because it reduces the level of stress hormones. The physical movement of laughing exercises your diaphragm, abs and shoulders. A good mood is also contagious; when one person is happy, it can lighten the energy of a whole room. So watch a sitcom, read a comic book or hang out with your funny friends.
Eat well
In pressing times, students often skip breakfast, load up on caffeine and grab anything for lunch. When in doubt, resort to the food pyramid. Fruits, veggies, cheeses and whole grains are especially good. Keep a healthy snack in your backpack. When your blood sugar is low, it becomes harder to concentrate. Well-nourished bodies are able to cope with stress more effectively.
Play a game
It’s simple and takes your mind off the long list of things you have to do. Whether it’s an outdoor game of football or a computer game, it can help distract your mind. Just be careful when you play a video game that it’s not an addicting one that will actually end up cutting into your study time.
Progressive Muscle Relaxation
It’s a weird one but it can successfully relieve body tension. Start by lying down in a quiet place, beginning with your face. Tense every part including your eyes and teeth, scrunch your face and hold that position for eight to 10 seconds while you inhale. Then release as you exhale and feel as the tension leaves your body. Repeat the process going down your body.
Keep track of everything
As the day goes on, random things pop into the mind: assignments, appointments and practices. Rather than letting the lists go around and around in your mind, write it down. Buy one of the handy planners provided by the USC bookstore if you need one.
Take a bath
Hot water can help soothe aching muscles and relax the mind. It can also slow the pace of a very hectic day. Maybe add some bubble bath; bubbles are very calming. Essential oils, powerful plant extracts restore mental, physical and emotional wellness. Take 10 deep breaths, in through your nose and out your mouth. Feel your stomach rise and fall with each breath.
Clean your room
Many people relate cleaning to drudgery, but the process of cleaning and the after-effects prove to be valuable. Reduce clutter — a mess of clothing and piles of paper can be subconsciously distracting. Removing excess and really cleaning can unearth the haven that your room truly is and can help you appreciate all that you have.
Sleep
You knew this was coming — sleep is incredibly important for the health and wellness of the body and mind. Young adults should get about eight hours of sleep every night, but unfortunately the average student gets six and a half hours of sleep, If you get enough sleep, you will wake up feeling refreshed and ready for the day ahead. But if you are sleep deprived, this can add to stress and make it a challenge to focus. Do yourself a favor: Don’t procrastinate. Get your work done as soon as possible and catch that extra hour of sleep. Your body will thank you later.

When I checked communication when applying to USC, I had no idea the stigma that would be attached to my major for the entirety of my undergraduate years. In case you have not heard, communication is a “joke” major — it is where you will find the most athletes and stereotypical sorority girls, so they say.
I have even had some of my closest friends approach me when I am studying and say, “What are you doing? Communication majors don’t study.”
Despite the countless times I have resented my communication major for the stigma attached to it, constantly playing with the idea of switching majors, I find myself, four years later, defending the communication major and what it stands for. In my four years at USC — do not be too shocked — I have, in fact, studied. I have pulled all-nighters and been stressed to the point of panic. But that’s not the point.
The point is that I chose to be a communication major because it coincided with my passions and career goals. For those of you who do not know, communication “explores the social, political and cultural functions of communication as it occurs in diverse settings ranging from interpersonal interaction to global media,” according to Northwestern University. There’s a lot you can do with a communication major, which is perfect for someone like me who knows a general area of interest, but would like the opportunity to pursue various career niches and areas of study.
Perhaps the most frustrating part of being a communication major — or I suppose any liberal arts major — is having other majors look down on you, like your field of study is trivial in a university flooding with pre-med students and future engineers. What irritates me most is the fact that with that comes the presumption that I am not smart. I am smart, and I could have been a physicist, a doctor or a lawyer. However, I did not want to do that because it wouldn’t make me happy; I want to tell stories, whether by means of journalism, creative writing, film or television.
I could not help but draw comparisons between the problem of major-shaming to a column in Glamour Magazine by Girls actress Zosia Mamet. Mamet wrote about the problem with many people’s perceptions of feminism because women become obsessed with “making it” and going for the gold, that they start looking down on someone if they simply follow their passions, even if those passions do not include becoming the head of a company or running the world Beyoncé-style.
In the article, Mamet writes, “I hate that we look at women who choose not to run a country as having given up.” Similarly, I hate when college students judge another student who has decided to not focus on curing cancer or going to the moon as lazy, unintelligent or incapable. Just like with feminism, the freedom to choose a way of life is not about choosing the “most prestigious” option, but rather, pursuing what makes us happy without judgment from our peers.
This is not a sad attempt to defend my decision to major in communication, but rather, a request for students to stop condescendingly criticizing other people’s majors. By looking down on someone’s field of study, students are undermining the value of personal choice in the process of deciding college majors.
I have no doubt that there are USC students who have chosen communication because it is “easier” than pre-med, and I have no doubt that there are students in the major that slack off and get by easily. However, it is ignorant to judge the whole undergraduate population with those standards — to ignore those who work hard, study late, memorize often and take on extracurricular internships and jobs to gain real-life experience.
Because those people exist and they work hard, and despite how many times you think you are just “joking” with your liberal arts friends, you could really be making them question their decision to follow their interests and passions.
In her Glamour column, Mamet writes, “The solution … is to ask ourselves what we actually want — each of us personally — and stop putting so much pressure on one another. Success isn’t about winning everything; it’s about achieving your dream, be that teaching middle school or flying jets” — or majoring in communication.
Mollie Berg is a senior majoring in communication. Her column, “All in a Day’s Work,” ran every other Wednesday.
Who was more of a genius: Mozart, Newton, Shakespeare, Keynes? The field of communications is as rigorous as you make it. And education shouldn’t be entirely instrumental in terms of getting a job. Do well in schools, learn some skills, do impressive extracurriculars etc and you’ll do fine. You never get a chance to do undergrad twice and studying something that you are passionate about is far more important than slugging through some subject that does not inspire you.
And everything you say is arbitrary to you. 
Education is important. But pragmatically speaking, you got to earn a living with that degree that will cost you a lot of money (undergrad and grad school). What you say is “feel good,” cheesy, and worse of all, cliche; it lacks substance and pragmatism.
I have very much experienced the job market. I used my non-STEM degree to get a very well-paying corporate job. The job is rather soulless but it pays extremely well. I guess that’s how you’d advise all young people to live their lives….
I don’t knock on those majoring in non-STEM. But if you’re going to brag about attending a “prestigious school with a highly selective admission rate, yada yada yada…” then you better be able to live up to that hype. A vast majority of non-STEM, business, humanities majors, and the like CANNOT find white collar jobs after graduating. USC and many other universities are hoping you’re oblivious to this. Furthermore, my friends who attended that school across town, here, and other places….who majored in SOFT degrees, went to not-so-prestigious law schools, and they’ve amassed $150K+ in debt, while only able to find $40Kish/yr. jobs. Owhhhh, so glamorous….One of them can’t find a job despite fervid efforts.
Better be careful about the choices you make in life.
You seem to be a bit ignorant of some non-stem degrees. I agree that some non-stem majors are very easy (com), and not things really worth studying. But some non-stem degrees (philosophy in particular) score better on standardized tests (LSAT, GRE, GMAT) than pretty much all stem majors except physics. Also philosophy majors have high mid-career median salaries than many stem majors. You should be careful to not over generalize.
You seem offended. And just because you assert it, doesn’t mean it’s true. No credible citations and just your opinions don’t mean it’s true. Funny how you left out the MCAT which is replete with bio sciences, general sciences, math, and English sections.
Sorry, didn’t mean to offend you. Why don’ t you philosphize that?
This is not a smart reply to an empirically true riposte to your original argument. Booby wins this one, I am afraid.
Oh geez, I was looking for your approbation *sarcasm if your “critical thinking” skills didn’t pick that up*. What’s empirical about what Booby asserted? No credible source.
It’s pathetic that you give yourself a “thumbs up” in nearly all your own comments.  I guess like that saying goes, “It doesn’t matter what others think.” You obviously are an insecure individual.
None that he stated in terms of sources, but plenty if you google. Learn those research skills you possibly learned in college. Or can you only research engineering subjects? Is it pathetic? It amused me so I did it to rile people like you. Seemed to work. Tell you what: you are wrong on this topic and something you’d learn if you took pyschology is cognitive dissonance. People tend to screen out information that doesn’t fit their priors. It takes a big man- and a superior intellect- to admit when they are wrong and update their opinions. We’ll see whether you have it in you.
Since you’re a “big man,” I”m awaiting your apology owed to me;)
…When you assert something in a debate, the onus is on you to prove it. You must provide the sources.
There are no rules on Daily Trojan comments ‘debates”. Google it rather than flail around. He’s right, you’re wrong. I AM sorry if you are too devoid of character to simply admit when you’ve made a mistake.
This is not true. Any employer who doesn’t realize that they are employing someone who needs to think critically and has to absorb lots of new information- and thinks that the content of your undergraduate degree means anything- is not an employer that you want to work for. At undergrad you are learning to think critically, tackle and synthesize new information, and learning intellectual skills that you take with you. This can be learned just as well in English literature as it can in engineering. If anything, some employers might worry about the soft skills of the latter.
Do what you are intellectually passionate about and show leadership in your extracurriculars. Everything else will work out.
WRIT 140 teaches you fallacious arguments e.g. strawman, slippery slope, begging the question, et al. You make too big of deal about how “rigorous” it is; it’s not.
Everyone takes a writing class. And plenty of non-STEM classes are rigorous. What an odd response.
A majority of communications majors, from freshmen to senior year, only step foot on campus 2 or 3 days a week. 
A 4 units class in COMM is basically 4 hours a week. A 4 unit class in BISC or CHEM is 3 hours of lecture a week, 3 hours of lab, and 5 semester hours of testing. I know many of COMM majors that are partying their way through USC. The Biology, Chemistry, or Engineering students I know that started off partying are now “Health Promotions” or “Business” students.
Anecdote is not the singular of data.
Who are you to assert that what Concerned Trojan wrote is anecdotal? Do you always use ad hominem attacks? You are thin skinned. That’s not how you win arguments. But more importantly, win them over. You’re more about winning a pissing contest that presenting logical argument. You are a bitter individual.
Complaining about an ad hominem attack (which it wasn’t) while making an ad hominem attack…. This is why critical thinking skills are more important than some STEM degree that any employer who interviews won’t be impressed by.
Yeah sure *sarcastically.* I’ll take the high road by acquiescing to your drivel. 
You win, hahaha!
It’s sweet of you to say it, but I already knew that was true.
Right, you knew all along that everything you said is drivel. 
You’re such a pansy. You’re vindictive and bitter.
Says the man who keeps responding with insults rather than argument. Listen, I know that some smaller people, when called out on being assertively wrong on a topic, tend to lash out at the person who corrects them. However, those of us with character tend to know that we can be wrong about all kinds of things. Or rather, rather like in the philosophy of science, we can only be right *for now*. This creates a kind of radical humility. If I am wrong, I say “how interesting”. I don’t have a fit like a toddler. I don’t know if this is emotional for you- perhaps you did sociology or something and failed to land a job and you’ve come in like Back to the Future to warn your younger self- but better to be rational. You’re wrong. It happens. Now you know and you won’t be. Doesn’t that feel good down there somewhere? I hope you have a blessed day.
Haha, communications is a joke!….J/K. 
You bring up some valid points. Most people don’t make it to med school, so when they thump their chests about being a bio-chem major I take them lightly. Most of them don’t thump their chest however, because the classes they take are HARD, and when you’re struggling to compete in them, you don’t have extra energy to brag about anything.

Everyone has somewhere to go. Everyone is running late and everyone is turning his or her head to find the one empty road to avoid traffic on the 110 South, the 405 or the 5. But drivers can stop turning their heads because Waze has swooped in to guide them to the shortest route to work or school or wherever they need to go. The app, owned by Google, provides alternative routes to rarely used side roads, avoiding busy freeways. It’s helping people get places faster — but it comes at a cost.
Narrow residential roads, as little as 22 feet wide, are being used as alternative routes instead of the congested Los Angeles freeways that are at near standstills most mornings and afternoons. Though these alternative routes are great for drivers in a hurry, the last thing they’re thinking about is how slow they’re supposed to go in these smaller roads. The practice of congesting roads that weren’t designed to handle major traffic isn’t just dangerous for drivers, but it also poses a huge risk for pedestrians.
“We have a massive issue here. It’s impossible for emergency vehicles to come through with all of this traffic,” Melissa Menard, a resident experiencing these problems, told the Wall Street Journal.
Undoubtedly, every hand will shoot up in the air when morning commuters are asked if they’ve ever been victimized by the I-wish-my-car-flew kind of traffic. But using relatively empty roads that people live on isn’t the answer. Residents in suburban areas pay for their safety and for the quiet lives they’re used to. As a result of the traffic in their streets, residents have given up morning walks and going to the gym. The traffic keeps residents either in their homes or stuck in their cars waiting for other drivers to let them out of their driveways.
The city recently spent $10 billion to widen the 405 freeway. The citizens of Los Angeles shouldn’t allow that money to go to waste. Freeways were meant to hold traffic, and at least for the safety and consideration of our neighbors, commuters should utilize freeways before a suitable solution can be found.
Moreover, by rerouting traffic on a mass level, Waze could increasingly urbanize suburban areas. If getting out of the driveway takes more time than making coffee in the morning, getting to work may be more frustrating than ever before. Instead of being removed from traffic, suburban areas could become places that families avoid and could have adverse effects on housing prices in the area.
Finally, we can’t forget about the pollution that increased traffic must be producing in the residential areas. Los Angeles residents already excessively pollute our air, and we should focus on keeping the pollution away from homes. So even though the traffic makes us sigh a hundred times over, let’s keep this a problem for the freeways and not our neighbors.
Laughable article written by someone who sounds like they are projecting their own views… they don’t drive on the freeway, they don’t want traffic going through their neighborhood. Let’s make up far reaching excuses not backed up by any statistical data or fact at all. Through streets already exist and are impacted
