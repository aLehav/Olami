For the first time since bringing home their second NCAA national title in a row, four players will represent the USC men’s tennis team to begin the individual season.
Senior Jaak Poldma, junior Daniel Nguyen, sophomore JT Sundling and freshman Ray Sarmiento will represent the Trojans at the 10th annual Napa Valley Tennis Challenge in St. Helena, Calif.
Texas, Florida, Kentucky, Illinois and Cal will field four-man teams in the weekend tournament to round out the field.
Along with a total of 24 college athletes, eight U.S. Tennis Association-selected junior players — including U.S. Open Junior Singles Champion Jack Sock — will participate.
“It’s a different format with junior players participating, and it is very different at this point,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “It’s most important to play matches and get experience.”
The format of the tournament is unique in that the 32-man field will be separated into 8 groups. The players will participate in round-robin group play and the group winner will advance to an eight-man playoff on Sunday.
Each match in the playoff will deviate from normal match play, with each match decided by a 10-point tiebreak until a tournament winner is determined.
The USTA will grant the champion a wild-card spot in a professional tournament.
When asked about how he decided who to send to the tournament, Smith said he was open-minded in his process.
“[I picked the four for] no particular reason,” Smith said. “I wanted Nguyen and Sundling to play some matches, and [Poldma] expressed interest in playing. They are all potential starters, and I wanted to get them going.”
The team began practice one week following a very busy schedule, which included a trip to the White House and the championship ring ceremony commemorating last year’s title.
“We have had one week of practice, the team is brand new, but it looks great,” Smith said. “Everyone is focused, motivated and worked very hard. There has been a big willingness to work hard at practice.”
Robert Farah — the ITA Player of the Year last season — has moved on to the professional ranks, but the new-look Trojans have three new freshmen who have helped fill the significant void.
“The team is very much the same, and we have some really good new players,” Poldma said.
As one of two seniors on the current squad, Poldma mentioned that participating will help him get back into tennis rhythm after some time off.
“I’m trying to get better and get back to my game,” Poldma said. “I have not played in tournaments for a while, so I would like to get the feel back.”
Overall, the team has shown a good attitude during the week of practice, and Smith said the players are motivated to maintain the high standard they have set for themselves.
“It’s been exciting,” Smith said. “We have a completely different team, but there is a great feeling on the court. We have got to stay hungry, and the hunger is there.”

The No. 1 USC women’s golf team travels to Franklin, Tenn., to defend its title at the Mason Rudolph Championship this weekend.
The Women of Troy won last year’s tournament, held at the Legends Golf Club, by two strokes, and set a tournament record in the first round with a score of ten-under par 278.
“Obviously it would be nice to make a run to defend our title,” coach Andrea Gaston said. “I think it’s just a matter of getting off to a good start and staying in there.”
Last year, however, the Women of Troy were led by tournament winner Jennifer Song, who left the school after last season and recently earned her LPGA tour card for next season. Song opened the last tournament with a six-under 66, and, as Gaston acknowledged, “it would certainly help to have a few low rounds to start us off.”
Leading the team this week is three-time All-American senior Lizette Salas, who is fresh off a third-place finish at the NCAA Fall Preview. Salas has never finished lower than 25th at the Mason Rudolph, highlighted by a tenth place finish in 2009. Salas, the only senior on the six-person team, is responsible for filling the void left by Song and three-time All-American Belen Mozo. Assisting Salas in leading the young team is junior transfer Lisa McCloskey, a two-time All-American. McCloskey finished fourth at the Fall Preview in her USC debut. She and Salas were both named to Golf World’s “Top Ten Women’s Golf Collegiate Players to Watch” list before the season.
Also returning for the Women of Troy is junior Inah Park, who will be making her season debut this weekend. Park was a member of last season’s NCAA runner-up team, and looks to be a key part of the team’s run for another title. She finished 30th at the Mason Rudolph last year. Sophomore Cyna Rodriguez, the only other remaining member of last season’s team, tied for 30th at the Fall Preview. She dropped out of the top 20 after an uncharacteristic final round 80, and looks to rebound this week. Rounding out the roster is freshman Rachel Morris, who finished 18th at the Fall Preview in her USC debut.
In addition to winning last year’s tournament, the Women of Troy finished second in the 2009 Mason Rudolph. A history of success at this juncture is very important to the team, which will be hosting the 2011 Fall Preview and 2012 NCAA Championship next season.
“A lot of teams wanted to get in there this year,” Gaston said.
For this week, the team is concentrating on playing a course that has survived a brutal summer. The floods in Tennessee and the natural Southern heat and humidity have left the course a little beaten up. That said, “Everyone is playing under the same conditions, so you have to have a good attitude about it,” Gaston said.
The tournament runs Friday through Sunday.

If you have yet to see members of the USC’s women’s tennis team in action, you won’t have to wait long to get the chance. The team’s fall season kicks off Friday at the Cal Nike Invitational, a weekend-long tourney hosted by the California Golden Bears.
The Women of Troy are currently ranked No. 20 in the nation. They ended the 2009 season with an overall record of 14-10 and a record of 5-3 in the Pac-10. Last season the team made it to the NCAA Championships for the 19th consecutive time, but was defeated by No. 12 Cal in the second round of play.
According to coach Richard Gallien injuries held back the team from its full potential, but the team is stronger this year.
“[Last year] we played on average with four healthy players, which is half of what you need … We are past that now. We got, in my opinion, the number one recruit in the country, Kaitlyn Christian, and we are healthy,” said Gallien.
Gallien is entering his 16th season with the team this year, having led the Women of Troy to the NCAA Championships every year he has coached them. In 2009 he was awarded Pac-10 Coach of the Year for the third time.
The 2010 season already looks promising for USC. The Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) released preseason rankings on September 10, with five out of ten members of the squad among the top 100 players in the nation. In the singles category senior Maria Sanchez is ranked No. 3, junior Alison Ramos is No. 19 and sophomores Danielle Lao and Valeria Pulido are No. 28 and No. 74 respectively.
“Everyone’s been working really hard and our practices have been really intense and efficient. These are the best practices I’ve had at SC,” Maria Sanchez said.
While rankings are bound to change after the first tournament, these initial numbers indicate USC’s strength this year. The ITA ranked freshman Kaitlyn Christian No. 9 in the newcomer singles preseason rankings. As a doubles pair Sanchez and Christian are ranked No. 42.
“We have the best freshman in the country, and there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic,” Gallien said.
With a solid season under their belts from last year, the Women of Troy look toward improving their national ranking this year and using their numerous nationally-ranked players to make it to the NCAA Championships for the 20th time in as many years.
“Our goal always is to win a NCAA title and this year I think we have the team to do it. Hopefully we’ll go far in the tournament, if not win it,” Sanchez said.
Gallien is also confident that this season will be a successful one.
“In terms of character, this is the highest level of character in any particular team I’ve ever had. I have a lot of confidence in this group that they will really fight well,” Gallien said.
With only seniors Cristala Andrews and Lyndsay Kinstler representing USC at the Cal Invite, many of the other members of the team are getting ready to start playing in the pre-qualifying round of the 2010 Riviera/ITA Women’s All-American Championships next weekend.
Play in the Cal Invitational begins tomorrow at 8 a.m. with doubles matches at both the Hellman Tennis Complex and the Channing Tennis Courts in Berkeley.

The No. 6 USC women’s volleyball team can only hope that conference play will be as successful as their non-conference game.
USC will begin an intense Pac-10 season this Friday, when it hosts crosstown rival UCLA at the Galen Center.
Giving a lift · Junior setter Kendall Bateman had 41 assists with two kills and one ace to lead the Women of Troy over Irvine last Tuesday. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
So far, the 11-0 Women of Troy have cruised through the season and swept nine of their opponents. But their non-conference schedule was a little more forgiving than the one that lies ahead.
The Pac-10 is quite the power conference, with six teams ranked in the top 25.
UCLA has an impressive ranking at No. 11 in the country, but of the 10 teams ahead of the Bruins, four are in the Pac-10.
Although the competition is fierce, the Women of Troy remain confident in their abilities.
“I think we have an outside chance to win the conference,” said USC coach Mick Haley. “We’re young, and if our youth doesn’t get too excited about it, I think we’re in the hunt.”
A number of different players have stepped up for the Women of Troy so far this season. Outside hitter Alex Jupiter recorded 13 kills and no errors Tuesday night against UC Irvine. In Saturday night’s match against Sacramento State, outside hitters Falyn Fonoimoana and Katie Fuller both had 10 kills.
“It’s pretty interesting to see who steps up in each of these matches,” Haley said. “I have no idea who will be the next one to step up Friday night.”
Despite the depth of his team and the nature of the heated rivalry between USC and UCLA, Haley was quick to praise the Bruins.
“[UCLA] might be a little undersized on the outside in a position or two, but they make up for it with some really great defense and hustle,” Haley said. “All the numbers on paper would indicate our teams are pretty much even.”
Haley also feels his team’s immense success will not prevent  the Women of Troy from being ready for this Friday’s matchup.
“I don’t think we’ll get overconfident,” Haley said. “What I hope is that we don’t get too jacked up for the match because they’re actually looking forward to the competition, and that’s the sign of a really good team.”
Even though it doesn’t seem like the Women of Troy have been tested much this year, they still have a lot of room for growth.
“We’ve got a whole laundry list of things we’re working on, but it’s always the serving and passing. You’re always trying to improve in that area — always trying to improve your defense,” Haley said.
Although USC has a slight all-time edge over UCLA, with 49 victories compared to the Bruins’ 45, UCLA has won the last three matches and six of the last eight.
“I think our kids will be all fired up,” Haley said. “They’ll be excited to play,”

After finally breaking through offensively against Oklahoma last Friday, the No. 22 USC women’s soccer team (5-1-2) hopes to take some of that momentum to the Pacific Northwest this weekend.
Leg up · Senior forward Megan Ohai, shown here against Northern Arizona, moved into the top 10 on USC’s all-time scoring list this season. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
With the team on a seven-game unbeaten streak, the Women of Troy will visit Gonzaga (3-5-1) for a 4 p.m. match on Friday in Spokane, Wash. On Sunday, they will travel to Cheney, Wash. to square off against Eastern Washington (0-6-1) for a noon game.
With Pac-10 conference play just around the corner, USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said he recognized the importance of the weekend road trip.
“We’ve got three games left to prepare ourselves for Pac-10 play. It’s always good to make a trip to the Pacific Northwest because it’s always a tough place to play,” Khosroshahin said. “It’ll give us a chance to play opponents we’re not accustomed to playing and to prepare ourselves for conference play.”
The players agreed.
“This is a test for us because both of these teams will be tough at home,” senior midfielder and forward Megan Ohai said. “It will set the bar for conference play. If we do well, then we’ll be ready, but we don’t want to take a step back right before [Pac-10] play.”
Taking a step back on offense isn’t on the team’s agenda either, after scoring seven goals in the last two games combined. Despite struggling to convert on opportunities early in the season, the Women of Troy are now showing their capabilities on offense.
“We’re putting away our opportunities and we’re creating for each other,” Ohai said. “I think we’re finally starting to gel, so we’re doing fine.”
Though USC lost redshirt junior midfielder Ashli Sandoval to an injury in the first half of the Oklahoma game, Khosroshahin said it won’t disrupt the continuity of the offense.
“We’ve been moving so many people around the past few games that [Sandoval’s injury] won’t be disruptive with what we’re trying to do right now,” Khosroshahin said.
Although the offense has taken some time to come together, a constant for USC this season has been the play of the defense and freshman goalkeeper Shelby Church.
“They’re doing an awesome job,” Ohai said. “They’ve shut down our opponents and have only let in a few goals, so they’re doing a really great job.”
The defense has only allowed three goals all season, while posting three shutouts in the process — and has yet to allow an opponent to score multiple goals.
Even though the Women of Troy have been playing both sides of the ball effectively in recent games, Khosroshahin said he still sees the need for improvement this weekend.
“We have to take care of the ball, limit scoring opportunities and finish,” Khosroshahin said. “That’s been a point of emphasis since day one. Each week we seem to get better in one area and then fall off in another area. Hopefully, we can string together a good weekend 90 minutes at a time.”

The moment came sometime in the second set of an early season non-conference match against Cal State Fullerton.
After a slow start that saw his team lose the opening set, USC women’s volleyball coach Mick Haley decided to put his trust in his freshmen.
Three straight set victories later, Haley’s faith has been rewarded.
“No matter who it was that I put in there, they all stepped up,” Haley said. “That’s when I got to thinking: This group really is going to be special.”
Now, this isn’t your ordinary group of rookies. Tabbed as the No. 1 recruiting class in the nation by PrepVolleyball.com, these six freshmen were among the most sought-after high school players in the country.
Still, turning that talent into results so quickly wasn’t easy.
“You always worry about freshmen because it’s such a big change from high school to the college game — it’s so much faster,” Haley said. “But these kids are a little bit exceptional in that they just adjust to whatever you throw them into.”
Infused with new talent, the Women of Troy have piled up 11 straight wins in non-conference play, losing only three sets in the process. They enter tonight’s match against UCLA at the Galen Center unbeaten and ranked No. 6 in the nation.
This group of freshmen might have arrived at the perfect time for USC volleyball. After reaching the Final Four for the fourth time in six years in 2007, the Women of Troy have faded into the middle of the Pac-10 standings over the last two seasons. In 2008 and 2009, USC didn’t make it out of the second round of the NCAA tournament, falling to Hawai’i twice.
“After we went to the Final Four in 2007, we expected to go back a couple of more times but we weren’t able to do that,” Haley said. “We just seemed to be lacking one player or the maturity of several players.”
Enter the recruiting class of 2010.
Outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana, ranked the No. 1 high school senior in the country last year, has boosted the Women of Troy’s attack with 85 kills, second on the team.
Middle blocker Alexis Olgard, the No. 5-ranked recruit, stands 6-foot-5-inches tall and is tied for second on the team with 21 blocks.
Libero Natalie Hagglund is one of two players to play every set so far for USC. Ranked the No. 1 player at her position in high school, Hagglund leads the Women of Troy with 130 digs.
“We knew that we were the No. 1 recruiting class in the nation but that just made us all work harder,” Hagglund said. “We knew that we were going to have a target on our backs.”
Sara Shaw (the No. 11 recruit) and Kirby Burnham (No. 49) can both play outside hitter and opposite, and have figured into the rotation as well, combining for 51 kills and 70 digs.
Outside hitter Sam Hirschmann has also played in five matches for USC.
“We probably out did ourselves in getting this many good kids in one class,” Haley said. “It’s almost a perfect storm.”
Normally, all the hype about a freshmen class like this could turn off the returning players on a team.
“Right when we came in [the upperclassmen] kind of laid down the law,” Hagglund said. “They told us, ‘We’re here to play as a team and not to judge you because you’re a freshman. We’re not gonna separate by class — everyone’s just as important on this team.’”
After a great performance in non-conference play that included a five-set road win over old nemesis No. 5 Hawai’i, the Women of Troy have earned national respect.
The real test, though, begins tonight with the start of a grueling 18-game Pac-10 slate.
The freshmen will also get their first taste of the cross-town showdown, with the No. 11 Bruins providing the opposition in front of Fox Sports Net cameras for the conference opener.
“For this freshman group, they want to be like the group in the early 2000s who took it upon themselves to say, ‘We’re never losing to the Bruins,’” Haley said. “I think they would like to start that again.”
A bold goal for a young group, but clearly, confidence is not a problem for these freshmen.
“They don’t fear that they’re not good enough,” Haley said. “They know they’re good enough. They get frustrated when they can’t be perfect all the time. It’s a whole different mentality with this group.”
To be sure, Haley is glad he trusted his freshmen. They haven’t disappointed.

After earning its first No. 1 ranking this season, the USC men’s water polo team (8-0) enters this weekend once again as the benchmark against which other NCAA water polo programs will assess themselves.
Distinguished · Junior two-meter Peter Kurzeka looks to lead the Trojans after being named MPSF Player of the Week for last week’s work. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
The Trojans will play a pair of non-conference teams today at the Lancer Invitational in Irvine, Calif. At 10:30 am, they face Fresno Pacific (1-7, at the time of publication), followed by a quick turnaround game against No. 16 Cal Baptist (9-1) at noon. The team will then head to Malibu, Calif., for its Saturday MPSF debut against No. 9 Pepperdine (5-4) at noon.
The hiatus between last season’s No. 1 ranking and this year’s was primarily because of preseason pollsters’ concerns regarding the young squad’s inexperience. After impressive, well-rounded offensive performances at the NorCal Tournament, however, few questions remain about this sudden infusion of youth to the squad. But don’t expect the sudden confidence from the pollsters to cause the Trojans to rest on their laurels.
“We’re more just focused on how we’re playing as a team — preparing for each individual opponent — as opposed to listening to what others are saying,” redshirt freshman driver Stephen Siri said.
Expect USC coach Jovan Vavic to rest many of his regulars against Fresno Pacific, as the Sunbirds’ water polo program is in only its fourth year of operation and not yet competitive against MPSF heavyweights like USC. Trojan reserves will be able to log some competitive playing time which they might not see against the team’s next two opponents.
Although many eagerly await the Trojans’ MPSF opener against Pepperdine, Cal Baptist is by no means a pushover. Critics might look at the Lancers’ sterling 9-1 record and note that they have only played against one MPSF team — No. 5 UC Irvine — and lost, but Vavic knows Cal Baptist will compete.
“We saw Cal Baptist play at the tournament on Sept. 4 and they really gave UC Irvine a tough game,” Vavic said. “As a matter of fact, they were leading UC Irvine in the final minutes of the game.”
Battle-tested Pepperdine awaits the USC men’s water polo team on Saturday. Despite a mediocre eighth-place finish in the NorCal Tournament, the Pepperdine offense is averaging more than 10 goals per game.
The Waves’ two leading goal scorers, James Perry and Danny White, are focal points of the offense and will look to challenge USC junior goaltender Joel Dennerley, who had been touted by Vavic as the best goaltender USC has ever had.
In preparing for the conference opener, the Trojans are focusing more on mental preparation than on tactical adjustments.
“We’re just trying to continue our momentum from last weekend,” Siri said. “We’re working hard for a tough game against a Pepperdine, and know that we can’t take anyone lightly.”

Three weeks and a few victories later, No. 20 USC (3-0) enters Saturday afternoon’s tussle with Pac-10 foe Washington State (1-2), still unsure where all of its 2010 puzzle pieces fit together.
Focused · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley will have a chance to improve on his two touchdown, two interception performance in Minnesota against Washington State on Saturday. Barkley has already thrown for nine touchdowns this season. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
During the last three weeks the Trojans have shown  their most consistent facet is the team’s ability to display a steady level of inconsistency.
Redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler has started the previous three games, yet it has been senior Allen Bradford and true freshman Dillon Baxter who have shined brightest at the position in the past two games.
Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley generated a lot of Heisman hype by starting the season with seven touchdowns and no interceptions, only to see that go by the wayside with a two-interception showing against Minnesota last Saturday.
On the other side of the football, defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin’s group has looked every bit the part of a bend-but-not-fully-break unit. There have been big plays, untimely penalties and a whole lot of uncertainty thrown in between.
Despite dropping in the AP polls for three straight weeks, the Trojans head into conference play perfect in the only stat that truly matters: their record. According to USC coach Lane Kiffin, the team continues to work to improve every day.
“I feel like the week overall was pretty good,” Kiffin said. “We’ve got to continue to do a better job of protecting the ball. That will be a major part of our focus this week — taking care of the ball and trying to finish a game in the plus-turnover margin. This is going to be a good trip for us. If we come away with the win … we’ll be satisfied.”
Saturday’s Pac-10 opener with the Cougars looks similar to the three previous showdowns the Trojans found a way to eke out — but in no way does that mean Kiffin is allowing his team to take a break.
“For us, it’s one game at a time and every game they let us play, our goal is to win,” Kiffin said. “There is a lot riding on each game, individually for the players and for us as a team. “
For Kiffin, Saturday’s game once again provides the opportunity for many on the team to gain much-needed in-game experience and get a feel of the football field before the cream of the Pac-10 schedule is upon them.
“We hope to rotate in a number of guys this week,” Kiffin said. “[We want to] get through this game, hopefully with a win, get to 4-0, come back for our Pac-10 opener at home and really have a good grasp of evaluating four games combined with everybody.”
If there ever was a place for a team still searching for its heartbeat, Pullman, the Washington town of less than 30,000 people, looks to be a suitable place to begin that search.
The Cougars’ defense is last in the Pac-10 in points allowed per game (40.7), rushing yards allowed per game (184.7) and total offense allowed per game (457 yards). The Cougars have also failed to beat USC since 2002, and have not taken out an AP top-25 opponent since 2006. They are coming off two consecutive 11-loss seasons.
There are bright spots, however, for Washington State, and those can be found mostly on the offensive side of the football.
Quarterback Jeff Tuel has put up 700 yards and five touchdowns through the air this season, true freshman receiver Marquess Wilson has amassed 281 yards receiving and two touchdowns, and running back James Montgomery will face USC after missing last year’s contest because of acute compartment syndrome in his leg. If the Cougars are to pull off the unexpected upset for their home crowd, the offensive attack appears to be their best bet.
But no matter what team shows up in Pullman to face the Trojans, USC seems to be focused on nothing other than playing its own game to the best of its ability.
“We just want to have a great game,” said senior cornerback Shareece Wright. “We’re not worried about who they are, or what they do. We’ve got to be ourselves and play our game.”

Less than half a mile walk from the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. is what documentary producer Sheila Johnson calls “the real D.C.,” which is “an underground horror that nobody wants to touch.”
Speak out · HIV-positive Jose Ramirez (left) works to educate his peers and community about the dangers of unsafe sex, yet manages to maintain a comedic outlook on life in Susan Koch’s documentary The Other City. - Photo courtesy of Cabin Films, photo by Jonah Koch  
This is the part of Washington, D.C. showcased in The Other City, a moving documentary directed by Susan Koch on the HIV epidemic plaguing our nation’s capital. Washington has the highest HIV rate anywhere in the country, and higher than the capitals of Haiti and Senegal. If 1 percent of the population were diagnosed, it would be considered a severe epidemic by the World Health Organization. The current rate is 3 percent — and it’s rising.
Those are not just numbers, but people, as journalist and screenwriter Jose Vargas reminds the audience early in the film. And that is what the documentary shows us: the “invisible” side of D.C. that isn’t seen on C-SPAN, Fox News or The Real Housewives of D.C., the side that is filled with real people, incredible poverty and extensive suffering.
The Other City follows a handful of characters, all HIV positive, who live in Washington, D.C. Koch says that it was important to her “to show that this disease is touching lots of demographics, and show their shared humanity.” She accomplishes this by following people of different races, ages, genders and sexual orientations, all of whom have inspiring, often heartbreaking stories to tell.
J’mia, a 28-year-old HIV-positive mother of three young children, is one of the characters with whom Koch spends the most time.  J’mia is losing her subsidized housing because the D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration lost funding.
She is adamant that her children will not live on the streets, and she goes through the arduous process of applying for new housing. She is ultimately put on a waiting list, whose wait could exceed two years. Although the narrative of J’mia’s housing search might move slowly with little dramatic tension, the audience feels a deep-seeded frustration with the bureaucracy that will let a mother and her three children end up homeless.
“I feel like I’m slipping through the cracks,” she said during the application process.
The most touching footage comes from Joseph’s House, a small hospice for people dying of AIDS where employees create a loving community for those who have come there. A 35-year-old man named Jimmy, who was diagnosed as a teenager, has elected to go to Joseph’s House.
Although Jimmy is unable to speak because of the advanced stage of his disease, Jimmy’s mother and sister speak, to heartrending effect, about what it is like to have a family member dying of AIDS.
Koch says she likes to take a “fly on the wall” approach when filming documentaries, and she captures some wonderfully intimate moments with Jimmy’s family and the Joseph’s House staff.
The young José Ramirez thankfully provides a note of humor to the otherwise emotionally draining film. José is gay, and works to educate young Latinos about practicing safe sex, specifically targeting the gay community. Though it is clear that José is serious about his work, he maintains a joking attitude. José, like many of the people in this documentary, has attempted to make the most of being HIV positive — by helping to protect others. And seeing his ability and eagerness to turn something so destructive into something so productive offers some faith in humanity.
Jose’s openness and frank discussion of sex and sexuality is a reminder of the importance of conversation. He half-jokingly harasses his mother for not talking to him about sex, but the issue of education is an important one.
Koch and Johnson both stress that they want their documentary to be an educational tool for young people, among whom HIV rates are growing. The generation that lived through the AIDS crisis of the 1980s, when medication was not always available, was intensely aware of the presence of the epidemic.
“AIDS was a death sentence,” Koch said, “People looked sick.”
But now, with better medicines, the virus has “disappeared” from sight. People have stopped talking about it, and thus many have stopped doing something about it.
The documentary, however, shows us what an inspiring group of individuals is doing to make a difference.

You might not be aware, dear reader, but we are in the midst of a good ol’ knock out of a movie year. Not since 2007 — the year of There Will Be Blood, No Country For Old Men and Juno — has the silver screen shone so bright.
Yes, there was something magical in the air that year, something tangible that reached out and shook a certain high school junior marooned in the suburban hypocrisy of rural Georgia. It reached out and grabbed me and made me look, not just at the screen, but at myself.
Simply put, the films of that year inspired me. They told the stories I wanted to tell and showed me the way to tell them. This is purely subjective of course, but how can one explain what inspires him? Art simply does or it doesn’t. Quality of craftsmanship doesn’t enter into it.
And now, in 2010, we have another year of films that have made me look beyond myself. Another round of films by filmmakers who tinted the prism through which I view life. I can’t tell you why or how they did this — I don’t have the skills to put it into words. All I can do is tell you what they are and hope you experience them for yourself. Hopefully you are as moved as I was.
The American
Who said Good Night, and Good Luck was gorgeous George’s coup d’état? Bull-pucky. When future cinephiles look back upon Clooney’s career, they will point to The American as his greatest triumph. Best crime drama of the year? Forget that. Make it the decade. Any decade. It makes Ben Affleck’s The Town look like a cutesy Hollywood knockoff of which Martin Scorsese would be proud.
This is a focused, complex character drama that builds rigorously and deliberately toward its stunning and emotionally gripping climax. Clooney plays an assassin whose life of cold-hearted, sinful self-denial has finally caught up with him. When he meets a beautiful Italian prostitute (played by the stunning Violante Placido), his desire for life, beauty and joy that overwhelms him, and he wants out. But, as we all know, it’s never that easy.
Clooney’s performance is transcendent. The best I’ve seen in years. He embodies a man overcome by the basest of emotions, all hidden beneath an exterior as cool, fine and transparent as a thin film of ice on a warm winter’s day. Such complexity hasn’t been seen since Daniel Day-Lewis plied his wares for P.T. Andersen as Daniel Plainview. Give the pretty boy his Oscar. He deserves it.
The Town
Did I just call this a cutesy Hollywood knock off?
Don’t listen to those who compare The Town to The Departed. They have the I.Q. of a rotting eggplant. The Departed should be compared to The Town.
The Town is better, and it’s not even a close contest. Unlike The Departed, which could be set in any city of the globe, The Town is about Boston crime. Beantown. It’s an exposé on urban crime, about how a city shapes and molds those very people whose actions destroy it.
The Town is about a way of life, a culture, and it preaches its message through a well-honed plot of strong-armed robbery. It’s not as solid as The American, its view of life not so crystallized. Too often it wanders into the realm of Hollywood blockbuster, but nonetheless it solidifies Affleck as one of the most interesting directors working today.
He follows up on the debut success of Gone Baby Gone with a film that is superior. In Boston, he has found his muse. I hope he stays there. If does, I expect great things from Affleck, and I think The Town only hints at things to come.
Ondine
Never seen it? Never heard of it? I don’t blame you, dear reader. I blame the heathen distributors who have railroaded Neil Jordan’s masterpiece.
And what a masterpiece it is, a fantasy about a down-and-out Irish fisherman (Colin Farrell) who one day reels in a young girl whom he believes to be a mermaid. Of course her appearance is met with suspicion, but after the fisherman’s luck begins to change and he is reunited with his young daughter (the beautiful and precocious Alison Barry), he begins to believe in the fantasy. And so does the audience.
Normally I detest fantasy. I have no use for it. But the tenderness with which Jordan treats his subjects draws you in, making you let down your guard and, most importantly, want to believe in the myth. I cannot tell you how rare an experience that is in the world of cynical dramas. Jordan has given us a jewel of film, and we should be thankful.
The Ghost Writer
Let me tell you how good Roman Polanski is. Although The Ghost Writer is one of his weaker films, I still think it is one of the best in one of the strongest years for film in recent memory. Too bad his personal life overshadows the fact that he is one of the greatest cinematic talents of the 20th century.
The Ghost Writer doesn’t mark the return of classic Polanski. Nothing will touch the triumphs of Knife in the Water, The Tenant, or Chinatown; but it is an extremely well-executed thriller with a sparkling cast.
Ewan McGregor enjoys a steady turn as the Ghost, a journalist brought on to complete former Prime Minister Adam Lang’s (Pierce Brosnan) memoirs after the first ghostwriter turns up dead. Inevitably, the Ghost finds himself entwined in a tangled web of lies, deceit and power-lust.
Predictable stuff, but Polanski’s steady and reliable hand guides The Ghost Writer to the No. 4 spot on this list, thumping Scorsese’s mediocre Shutter Island which was released the same weekend. Unlike Scorsese, Polanski does not forget his Modernist roots, remembering that in order to create suspense, one must hold a shot longer than three seconds.* Thrillers are not music videos. Scorsese would do well to remember that. Polanski imbues his film with a stark, barren beauty that is wonderful to behold.
*I am not exaggerating. At one point I actually whipped out my stopwatch. For 15 minutes, Scorsese didn’t hold a shot for more than three seconds.
Easy A
Finally, we arrive at the fluff, the cotton candy if you will. And boy is it sweet. Emma Stone is delectable as Olive Penderghast, an obscure high school student who rises to prominence by becoming the school hussy.
Easy A is easy viewing (pardon the pun), featuring snapdragon, pulp-culture laden dialogue the likes of which haven’t been seen since Juno. Unlike the first four films which leave you somewhere between stunned and introspective, Easy A is a shot of adrenaline that leaves you feeling giddy as soon as the credits roll.
So far 2010 has given us three thrillers, a fantasy/drama and a comedy of superlative quality. Together, I would pit them against the top five of almost any other year. I do so because each of them tells a story from a perspective that is both new and unique — and that’s what makes them special. To me, the characters are real. They speak to me. I care what happens to them.
You know, I thought it was a mistake when the Academy expanded the Best Picture nominees to 10. Now, I’m thinking that might be just about right.

Startup · Neil Joglekar, founder of the video clip website ReelSurfer, shows off his product as part of Social Media Week Los Angeles. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
But that’s the thing about social media — no one can ever fully master it. Social media is a fluid platform with continuous transformations that only get progressively faster. And that’s what Social Media Week, which officially kicked off Monday in five different cities around the world, seeks to celebrate and discuss.
Social Media Week had its first conference in New York City in February 2009. It was a hit — more than 2,500 people attended the first conference.
The second conference was held a year later in February 2010, but this time expanded to six different cities worldwide: New York City, London, Berlin, San Francisco, Toronto and São Paolo. This event attracted three times the crowd at 7,500 attendees and reached more than 100,000 online viewers.
This fall, Los Angeles joins four other cities in hosting the third Social Media Week conference, with USC serving as one of its sponsors.
Social Media Week is not your average conference. Unlike a typical gathering where the time, location and participants are rigid and restricted, Social Media Week embraces the very essence of social media by unbarring all reservations to its events.
“What we wanted to do is kind of reinstate the conference setup, because we think it’s boring to just sit people in a hotel for a few days,” said Ben Scheim, global director of Social Media Week and vice president of Crowdcentric, an organization that aims to connect people across the world via collaborative platforms that founded Social Media Week.
Instead, Crowdcentric selects cities suitable for Social Media Week by looking for what it calls a city partner, which is primarily the presence of a connected network passionate about engaging the community. This city partner will be made up of different organizers who have a wide base of contacts and are willing to put up events in their own venues.
That means that instead of a single committee dictating the course of events, a spectrum of different brands and companies create various events at all corners of the city, from casual Hollywood bars and Whole Foods Markets to public libraries and formal auditoriums at KCET Studios.
The event topics also range from serious panel discussions about technology or business to fun meet-ups such as group yoga sessions — but all pertaining to the uses and impact of social media. And the best part is that most of these events are free.
This wide range in the event menu showcases just how much social media has infiltrated all levels of society. It is not just for the young and hip, but rather encompasses all generations and activities. And many companies are taking notice, including major media companies like The New York Times and LA Weekly. In fact, these companies are just two of the many sponsoring Social Media Week.
“All these companies are very invested in the 21st century and the next 15 years to come,” Scheim said. “They have embraced social media and are very much activating journalism trends with it.”
Ironically, the same cannot be said of most students, who are social media pros on the surface only.
The majority of USC students aren’t strangers to social media. During any given lecture, more than half of the students can usually be seen browsing some kind of social media platform. But for people who are serious about social media, popular platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have long been considered old school.
“A lot of students use social media, but they’re not equipped or haven’t been taught to analyze social media and to think of it as something to study,” said Sonia Seetharaman, Program Coordinator for the USC Institute for Multimedia Literacy, which hosted Social Media Week events. “An important point that Social Media Week aims to address is how we, both students and professionals alike, can learn to leverage new and burgeoning social media technologies.”
And that is one of the reasons why the IML invested in this event, Seetharaman said. By enlightening students on the academic uses of social media, the IML hopes students will be able to enrich their work with the new dynamic tools that are available.
But many students have yet to discover how to use social media outside of their social lives.
“Social media has an academic and professional potential that most students don’t realize,” Seetharaman said. “You can use your iPhone for so much more than texting and talking and playing games, but this potential tends to be ignored by many academic communities.”
By bringing Social Media Week to campus, organizers hope students will become more aware of the current social media topics and trends, and be able to not just utilize them in jumpstarting their career paths and professional images, but also to enliven their education.
That’s what true education should be like, Seetharaman said.  Students shouldn’t be just absorbing information, but creating and disseminating information as well —which is made easier through social media.
“Social media gives everybody equal access,” Seetharaman said. “Everyone needs a voice to be heard, and that’s what social media allows you to do, no matter who your social status, economic status or political stance. It’s an equalizer. It brings people together who normally wouldn’t be in the same space. Using social media can give rise to new theories, new discourse and new points of view because you can access people and viewpoints you normally wouldn’t be able to access.”

It’s often said the sign of a good movie is one that can be watched on mute. The acting and directing alone should convey enough conflict that words become superfluous.
Now, what about a film that would fail that test, but would work as a radio play — a film with one character, in one very small location, that relies on sound design as much as visuals? Buried is such a film, and it’s not any worse off because of it.
In Buried, Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds), a civilian contractor working in Iraq, finds himself six feet underground. Iraqi insurgents attacked his convoy, and put him, a cell phone, a Zippo lighter, a flashlight and a few glow sticks into a coffin and interred it somewhere in the desert.
Buried inhabits the polar opposite end of the genre from last year’s Moon. Both tell the story of men trapped alone, trying to understand their strange circumstances while outside forces conspire against them. Where Moon features an astronaut isolated in the vastness of space, Buried instead focuses on Paul’s struggle to survive in a place smaller than a linen closet.
For the entire 95-minute run of the movie, the camera stays with Paul in the coffin. With no dream flashbacks or dream sequences to let Reynolds stretch his legs, director Rodrigo Cortés and writer Chris Sparling are tasked with keeping their thriller tense and entertaining without getting repetitive or absurd.
The sound department deserves ample kudos for bringing the audience into the film. The sound mixers deliver every noise, be it a thump, the hiss of a snake’s tongue, or the sifting of sand through speakers at different sides of the theater.
When the film opens in the dark, with nothing but the sound of Paul breathing, coughing and grunting, the audience shares Paul’s experience. It’s visceral filmmaking, and imbues the film with a tense realism from the start.
Cinematographer Eduard Grau’s lens only enhances that tension. Grau and Cortés keep the camera tight. So tight, in fact, that they often capture just a wedge of Reynolds’ face. When they manage to show his whole body, he’s always framed within the confines of pine and dirt. Both cinematic and claustrophobic at once, it manages to keep a film with one sparse location visually interesting.
Those technical flourishes alone can’t carry a movie. Sparling’s script bares the biggest burden. It doesn’t start as the most original concept. Quentin Tarantino has twice buried his heroes in a coffin, once in Kill Bill: Vol. 2, a second time in an episode of CSI.  The SyFy Channel even had a Web series, Buried Alive, in which five people are kidnapped and find themselves in the titular conundrum.
It seems whoever marketed this film knew this and advertised the movie as a man potentially stuck in the middle of a conspiracy “with 90 minutes of oxygen” — an odd touch, since the volume of oxygen in the coffin and how long it will last are never once estimated in the film.
Few of these examples, though, focus on just one character in one place. True, Paul can communicate with the outside world through the cell phone, but rarely is a film so confined.
To keep things fresh after that initial hook, Sparling piles on ticking clocks. As if waking up in a coffin wasn’t bad enough, Paul deals with an evil corporation, his dying cell phone battery, a faulty flash light, lots of sand, the agency trying to rescue him and a menacing villain who keeps calling asking for a few million “monies” in ransom.
Sparling doles these out one at a time, and then comes back to them, turning the pressure up higher with each new development. There are a few absurd turns.
One scene with Paul waking up with a snake in his shirt, and another in which he has a heartbreaking, yet contrived, phone call with his employer, come to mind. Yet, these can be forgiven. Even they serve a purpose and elevate the physical and psychological stress on Paul to new levels.
Without a star like Reynolds, Sparling’s script might not work so well. For all the thrills, Sparling manages to slip in a good amount of humor. Reynolds has a gift for timing, one that allows him to deliver the funnier lines with a snappy wit.
And although a lesser actor might struggle to balance that humor with the pathos needed, Reynolds navigates the dramatic scenes without breaching melodrama. For all his good looks, the guy’s more than just a pair of chiseled abs.
Not for those afraid of the dark or claustrophobic, Buried is a bit like a roller coaster. It’s fast and it’s fun, and if anyone in the audience tries to close their eyes to escape the thrill, it only gets scarier.

On the first day that the new Affordable Care Act goes into effect, California’s Public Interest Research Group held a panel discussion to importance of the bill and what it means for young adults.
“What we’re celebrating today is really just the first step toward creating a system that actually functions,” said USC medical student Joshua Lilienstein.
Lilienstein was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2006, while in medical school. He said his saga of trials and tribulations made him aware that the network of hospitals, pharmacies and doctors wasn’t cohesive.
“I myself was responsible for making sure nothing fell through the crack,” Lilienstein said about his experience as a patient. “This is an incredibly leaky system.”
The U.S. Public Interest Research Group and non-profit organization Families USA released The Young Person’s Guide to Health Insurance, a pamphlet that explains health care rights and options available under the new law.
Events on 35 college campuses across the country, including USC, were held to distribute the material.
“During the six months since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed, there has been great confusion about the provisions and their implications,” said a press release by Health Insurance Sort, an independent health insurance comparison agency.
Mike Russo, a health care policy expert and CalPIRG Health Care Reform advocate, commended the law because he said believes young people are the hardest hit by this crisis.
“The provisions that go into effect today are the first of many that will help California’s families and young people rest a bit easier about their health care,” Russo said.
Some aspects of the new law include: bans against the denial of pre-existing conditions and charging more for a woman than a man for coverage. A student can also now stay on his parents’ plan until the age of 26.
Assemblyman Mike Davis, of the 48th District which includes USC, said he is proud we have made health care as equally important as education.
“Today is probably one of the most significant days that the United States of America has experienced in decades in terms of public policy,” he said. “I stand here today proud that our country is saying health care is important.”
Even Lilienstein acknowledged that insurance companies are not all malicious.
“From the provider point of view, there is a huge well of good will to want to make the system better,” he said. “But it will be very difficult for us to pull together a cohesive statewide plan.”
Dr. Michael Cousineau, an expert in health care policy, said he was surprised that more people didn’t know the details of the law.
“it’s important for young people to get information out there,” Cousineau said. “I’m surprised to find out how many young people didn’t know about health care.”
Enjoy it while it lasts, commies. November is coming, and freedom.

Week of Sept. 24
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole
Rated PG
Zack Snyder, the mastermind behind the massively successful 300 and last year’s faithful adaptation of the quintessential graphic novel, Watchmen, has decided to steer his career into uncharted waters with his latest offering, a computer-animated children’s movie about owls. The island of Ga’Hoole is the site of an evil plan to kidnap and brainwash young owls into a military mindset. Young owl Soren must escape from Ga’Hoole and gather an army to fight back. Audiences can expect a visual tour-de-force from Snyder’s first venture into animation.
Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps
Rated R
Michael Douglas returns to portray corporate raider Gordon Gekko, a role that earned him his first and only Oscar win for Best Actor for this sequel’s 1987 predecessor, Wall Street. Douglas stars alongside actual off-screen couple Shia Labeouf and Carey Mulligan in this tale of greed, decadence and revenge. This time around, director Oliver Stone focuses his ever-critical eye on the current financial crisis and presents a long-awaited sequel with striking relevance.
Buried
Rated R
A U.S. contractor working in Iraq suffers a brutal attack only to awake to find himself six-feet-under and locked inside a coffin with only a lighter and cell phone. Using this simple concept, Spanish filmmaker Rodrigo Cortés creates a truly unique, pulse-pounding and claustrophobic thriller. Hitchcock would surely be proud.
You Again
Rated PG
Hilarity ensues when old high school rivals clash once again in this star-studded comedy. The beloved Betty White flexes her comedic muscles alongside Jamie Lee Curtis, Sigourney Weaver, Kristen Bell and Kristin Chenoweth.

Students can celebrate Friday night Shabbat in the comfort of their own homes through USC Hillel’s Shabbat in a Box, a program that provides students with the essential items to mark the weekly holiday.
The program — which began at USC in the spring after USC Hillel saw other university Hillels had similar efforts — encourages the weekly practice of the Jewish day of rest, Friday, said Eric Kawalsky, co-chair of Shabbat at USC Hillel.
“The purpose of the program is to encourage students to bring Judaism home with them so they can carry on customs and traditions in their own homes,” Kawalsky said.
Shabbat is celebrated differently from household to household, Kawalsky said. Some refrain from doing any type of work during the period of rest, including driving and cooking, while others celebrate by lighting candles and enjoying a home-cooked meal.
“Shabbat in a Box provides the possibility for students to express their Judaism and explore Shabbat in their own way,” Kawalsky said.
Shabbat in a Box is offered every week to students who choose to hold their own Shabbat dinner rather than attend the meals hosted by Hillel. The funding for Shabbat in a Box comes from the same donors who provide funds for Hillel, Kawalsky said.
Students can sign up for Shabbat in a Box — which can provide materials for up to 10 people — on Wednesdays. In each box is one large bottle of grape juice, one large challah, Shabbat candles, a Shabbat prayer guide, utensils and a small stipend to help purchase ingredients for the meals. The boxes can be picked up either the Thursday before Shabbat or the morning of at Hillel, located near Hoover Street and Jefferson Boulevard.
“This is a fantastic idea. It enables students to bring Shabbat to their college doorstep,” said Ben Kattan, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “I feel like much of the beauty of Shabbat is being able to enjoy it in the comfort of your own home or in this case your second home, and this is exactly what Hillel is allowing students to do.”
Hillel receives about 10 orders for boxes on per week for Shabbat in a Box, Kawalsky said.
Kawalsky said Shabbat in a Box had received positive feedback because of the program’s ability to create a cohesive Jewish experience outside of Hillel.
“Shabbat in a Box excites me because it allows people to experience Shabbat dinner in their own way,” Kawalsky said. “[Students] can share with their friends how Shabbat was done with their families, or they can share a Jewish custom with some non-Jewish friends.”
Leanna Balaban, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said she appreciated Shabbat in a Box.
“I think it is a great idea,” Balaban said. “It gives people more of an incentive to connect with their religion and community at home.”

The Viterbi School of Engineering, a leading school in robotic research, received a Personal Robot 2 to further research and help create new ways in which robots can function in human society.
Mr. Roboto · The Personal Robot 2 can grasp objects using its hands, a helpful tool for functioning in human society. It will be used as a research tool for students and professors. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
Willow Garage, a team of researchers that develops robotics hardware and software, gave the PR2 to USC and 11 other universities, including Georgia Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, the University of Tokyo and the University of California, Berkeley.
“By receiving the PR2 robot, it affirms that USC and Viterbi is one of the leading groups in robotics in the world,” said Gaurav Sukhatme, USC professor and director of research in the department of computer science.  “The robot gives us the ability to think of very new ideas and test them out in a state-of-the-art platform.  It is an excellent recognition.”
The lead figures involved in research with the PR2 robot at USC are Sukhatme, Stefan Schaal, a professor in the department of computer science, and Maja Matari, senior associate dean for research computer science.
“We are excited to be a part of the robotics development,” Schaal said.
According to Willow Garage, the PR2 combines mobility to navigate in human environments and dexterity to grasp and handle different objects and tools.
“We work on creating robots which will be part of a modern human society,” Schaal said.  “We decided to apply for the PR2 robot because we thought that it would be great to use the resources that it is able to provide.”
Sukhatme said each professor will utilize the robot differently. Sukhatme is leading the Robotic Embedded Systems Lab, Schaal is leading the Computational Learning and Motor Control Lab, and Matarić is leading the Interaction Lab.
“The three of us have separate research groups and our interests are slightly different, but related in certain areas,” Sukhatme said.  “Many different research projects will be conducted with this robot and tons of projects are being worked on all across the world.”
The Interaction Lab focuses on socially assistive human-robot interaction.  Matarić said her research is aimed at giving robots the ability to help people, especially those with special needs.
Students said they are also looking forward to the new discoveries that the robot will provide.
“The fact that USC received the robot just proves how it is a leading institution and strong in robotics,” said Anna Lee, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering. “As a student in Viterbi, I hope to be involved with and see the development and growth in robotics.”

Last week students at the Harrisburg University of Science and Technology were submitted to a social media experiment: a week-long self-regulated ban on websites such as Facebook, Twitter and MySpace.
Citing data showing increased Facebook use, the school officials who proposed the ban hoped to shed a negative light on the perceived overusage of social media.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Most students at the university had no major complaints about the break; some even welcomed the relief from the pressure to check their Facebook pages every time they logged onto their computers. Rather than feeling crippled by the lack of online networking, the students handled it with a maturity that the officials might have thought they were otherwise incapable of.
Our parents’ generation seems to have a baseless fear that online applications cause lethargy and indifference in today’s youth. For many years, adults have lamented that children are wasting away in front of their computer screens and iPhones, no longer able to sustain relationships without the assistance of technology. They have over-romanticized the so-called “lost art” of mailing a written letter, as if the only way to genuinely communicate with someone far away is through physical handwriting.
The truth is, this constant flow of informational input has given us instant knowledge of universal trends, making us more adaptable to different situations in the future. Facebook might just be a large network that arguably has little measurable value in the workforce, but it gives people the important ability to increase their social capital. Especially in the oversaturated medium of a typical college campus, students can use Facebook to draw attention to any cause or event they want to advertise. More importantly, Facebook allows friends to share content; news articles, music, movies and even personal musings are much more widely distributed among those who would otherwise never think to visit a news website.
And Twitter is a whole different animal. True, many celebrities have advanced its power to bait their rabidly obsessed worshippers, but the real power of Twitter lies in its ability to disseminate information quickly. Rather than being colored by outside sources, Twitter allows politicians, athletes and anyone else to directly communicate with the public.
One of the more justifiable fears involving Internet usage is the rise in obesity it can cause among children. Generations past spent a much larger portion of their free time engaging in outdoor activities that helped keep them fit; video games and social media leave children little incentive to play hopscotch.
This decreased physical activity can be at least partially countered with the fact that today’s youth has a better-developed health education. A constant barrage of information demanding kids to avoid trans fats and cigarettes has resulted in a very health-savvy generation that often has to teach its parents the merits of modern medical information.
Although we might waste some of our “work” time catching up on social media websites, our days are less structured than the rigid schedules of the past. Ultimately, our generation shows that we have a knack for multitasking to an unprecedented degree. This multitasking ability allows us to “waste” more time, but at the same time learn more and produce more.

As college students, we’re fresh-faced, bright-eyed and probably a little naïve; we’re preparing for a headfirst dive into the rest of our lives. It follows that people generally enjoy giving us advice.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Some of this advice is amazing. Some of it is questionable. Sadly, few things circulate faster than bad advice.
With this in mind, I created a survey asking students to list the bad advice they’ve been given most frequently. I won’t lie and say the survey was a hit — about 40 people responded, which is a little more than .2 percent of the undergraduate population. But let’s just disregard the fundamentals of statistics and continue as though this was a good sample. I’m sure you’ve done it in your classes.
Interestingly enough, I found a clear theme in the responses — we’re constantly told to seize the day. Follow your heart. Skip class and start a water fight. Have another drink — you only have four years of college. Living in the moment is healthy, but college sometimes feels like a contest of who’s more whimsical. I get the sense that many of us have this massive, irrational fear of missing out on recklessness.
Maybe I’m a traitor to my age group, but I refuse to believe that we only have four years to act on our impulses.
I can understand the idea behind it: It’s hard to think of another time in life where ample possibilities intersect with few responsibilities. Still, live fast and die young? Tacky.
I firmly believe that the neurotic need to live in the moment comes from the assumption that life ends at 30. That, it appears, is about the age at which my peers believe one abandons all improbable dreams and becomes a so-called functioning member of society. So what? Social norms are the only things stopping you from being impulsive for the rest of your life. It requires some balancing, but there’s a helpful trick: a simple framework of responsibility.
What exactly is a framework of responsibility? Honestly, I just made the term up. I realize the name is ridiculous — as though I’ve read one too many academic journals — but bear with me. Having a framework of responsibility means resisting the urge to cram all spontaneous action into four short years.
The first component of this framework involves goals. Although choosing a dream job is hard, it helps to commit to something, even if you have a sneaking suspicion that it’s not a perfect fit. Life becomes more orderly when you’re striving toward a specific goal. If you arrive at it and decide it’s not for you, you can always start over — and you’ll do it with credentials you wouldn’t have gotten if you had spent your time sitting around wondering what to do with yourself.
The second component involves a minimum level of success. With your dream job in mind, what’s the least you need to do to be a viable candidate? A potential physicist would need to maintain a high GPA and get involved in research. A future filmmaker would need to devote time and resources to a quality portfolio. Every job requires different things, but it’s important to first find out what the bare essentials are and to strive for them.
The clearer the framework of responsibility, the more room there will be for rash decisions along the road of life. Think of it this way: If you party hard without working hard for four years straight, you eventually limit your options. You might have to spend the next 10 years scrambling up the corporate ladder — a task that leaves little room for impulsive decisions. But if you balance your partying with good grades, leadership positions and a few key internships, you’ll end up at a higher starting point after graduation. Most likely, your corporate ladder scramble will be a bit more like a stroll. There’s time to be impulsive when you’re strolling.
According to Psychology Today, studies have shown that occasional misbehavior leads to a happier, more productive life. And sometimes, once-in-a-lifetime opportunities spring up near important tests. That’s completely understandable. Still, the habit of avoiding responsibility is only fun in the short term. Goal-setting can buy valuable breathing room in the future. It can also buy a trip to Ibiza. The Row versus Ibiza — think about it.
My biggest nightmare is turning 30 and realizing that my best years were in college. Yes, this time can and should be amazing, but we all have decades ahead of us. Don’t just seize the day, and don’t just seize your college years. Carpe vitam. Seize your life.

An already undermanned football just got a little thinner.
USC announced yesterday that junior safety Drew McAllister will undergo surgery and miss the rest of the season because of a lingering hip injury. He sat out spring practice while recovering from surgery on his hip.
McAllister recorded one tackle against Hawai’i in the season opener. In 2009, he appeared in nine games and racked up 15 tackles and a forced fumble. As a true freshman, McAllister led the team in interceptions with three.
USC coach Lane Kiffin said McAllister will redshirt this season. NCAA rules allow injured players who appear in a game to redshirt if their injury occurred during the first four games of the year and ended their season.
“He’ll get another year and that will help us,” Kiffin said. “We’re trying to redshirt as many people as possible.”
With the loss of McAllister, freshman safety Demetrius Wright is expected to take on a more prominent role. ESPN named Wright one of the top 150 recruits in the country last year.
“He’s going to play [against Washington State] regardless of the score,” Kiffin said.
Yesterday’s reinstatement of freshman safety Patrick Hall will also add depth to a depleted secondary. Hall was suspended indefinitely before the season for disciplinary reasons.

Through a program called “Threading the Needle of the American Dream,” low-income community college students are having higher access to eight prestigious universities, including USC. In just two years, the number of transfers enrolled into these schools tripled, according to The Washington Post.
The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, an organization that seeks to help “promising students reach their full potential through education,” was launched in 2006, with one of its stated goals enabling a stronger transfer between community colleges and prestigious four-year universities. The foundation held a three-day conference called “Partnerships that Promote Success” in Washington, D.C., where it released its new numbers.
Elements of USC’s installment of the program include SCholars Clubs at various community and technical colleges to provide transfer advising, access to USC’s writing center for prospective transfer students, and a week-long “immersion experience” for low-income transfer students to help them get acclimated to the coursework at USC.
The other seven schools listed in the initiative are Amherst College, Bucknell University, Cornell University, Mount Holyoke, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of North Carolina and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

In an effort to educate students about the importance of greenhouse legislation, USC’s chapter of the California Public Interest Research Group campaigned this week to obtain 4,000 pledges to vote no on Proposition 23, which would overturn California’s Global Warming Solutions Act.

After three days of campaigning on Trousdale Parkway, 1,000 pledges have been obtained, said CalPIRG campus coordinator Brittany Heenan. Though short of the original goal of 4,000 pledges, chapter president David Mittelstein said the spirit of the initiative is not deterred.
CalPIRG’s goal of 4,000 pledges was part of a larger effort by CalPIRG chapters across the state to secure an estimated 100,000 pledges on 45 college campuses this week. Statewide, CalPIRG collected 10,579 pledges.
“Getting the word out there will still have a positive effect,” said Mittelstein, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering. “If Proposition 23 passes, it will not be beneficial for the economy or the environment.”
CalPIRG’s concern is that California’s influence as a leader in the green initiative will be lessened if the proposition passes in the November election.
The proposition stipulates that California’s current environmental protection laws will be restored only after the state unemployment rate is lower than 5.5 percent.
“If Prop 23 passes, it will not be beneficial for the economy, or for anybody but the oil companies,” Mittelstein said.
Arthur Li, member of the USC CalPIRG chapter and a sophomore majoring in philosophy, said eliciting student support has required persistence.
“We are doing everything we can, but it is difficult when students pledge but aren’t enthusiastic,” Li said.
Li said he can only hope everyone who pledges will follow through in their voting.
“It’s important for people to have integrity, especially when it comes to the environment,” Li said. “California will become black and oily if people don’t vote no on Prop 23.”
After pledging to vote no on Prop 23, Alisa Kim, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism, said she believes people of her generation care about the environment.
“We are so limited in what we can do,” Kim said. “When the opportunity arises, we need to do what we can.”
CalPIRG members will continue to campaign on campus to achieve 6,000 total student pledges in hopes of educating voters before the Nov. 2 election.
“CalPIRG sets high goals,  — that’s just the way we operate,” Li said. “I think we’re still on a good track.”
Earl,
Are you high?
You sound like you are high.
The state of the ecomony in California is pretty bad.  More regulation is only going to send jobs and people elsewhere.  California has no lock on the businesses that are here.  If they leave, so do the jobs.
Companies are in business of making money, not providing jobs, health care, or social services.  When regulations and costs on business gets so high you don’t make money, you close down or move away to a new location where things are better suited for your business.
Lay of the pipe!
The California Jobs initiative (CJI) is an oil corporation farce and fraud. There is no connection, whatsoever, between greenhouse gas emission reduction and the loss of jobs. This notion is an insult to the intelligence of the people of California. In fact, there is job growth in the clean, renewable energy industry. Chevron employs 65,000 worldwide and CJI is not going to change this. The only jobs created by the oil industry are clean-up jobs after oil spills and deep water, blow-outs and pump-handler jobs. CJI will make fantastic profits for the oil industry, increase air pollution, especially in communities around their refineries, and there will not be lower gas prices. Koch Industries, Valero and Tesoro are super Enrons. Since when did the oil companies start to show any concern for the unemployed and their families and for small businesses?

A professor of industrial and systems engineering at USC has finished developing a three-dimensional “printing” device that creates buildings, which is now being incorporated into research and lectures at USC.
Building blocks · A 3-D printer, named as a top 25 invention by the National Inventors Hall of Fame, was developed by a USC professor. - Photo courtesy of Berok Khoshnevis
Berok Khoshnevis began work on his Contour Crafting device in 2000 after recognizing fabrication technology’s ability to create buildings. In 2006, it was named one of the top 25 inventions by the National Inventors Hall of Fame.
Khoshnevis said he believes this new technology that is working toward building full-scale structures is the future of home creation.
Khoshnevis compared his work in the engineering of architecture to “the Wright Brothers’ 12-second flight for aviation.” He described his work as just the beginning of a much longer process that will eventually lead to an entirely new industry.
Contour Crafting creates structures solely by a computerized process. In the process — called “robotically guided extrusion” — the 3-D printing device expels a concrete-like substance out of a nozzle and forms structures by building up, layer by layer. The nozzle moves in space to create the patterns, dictated by a computer.
Much different than a traditional paper printer, the device stands 13 feet high, 17 feet wide and 25 feet long.
This is only a prototype, Khoshnevis said, and the actual device will be much larger. Currently, the device primarily builds models of homes.
Steven Nutt, professor of material sciences and mechanical engineering at USC, worked alongside Khoshnevis on developing the material used for the buildings.
“[It was] challenging to develop a material that will flow and also rapidly harden sufficiently to carry weight of subsequent layers without slumping,” Nutt said.
The problems of clogs in the nozzle also arose, which complicated development process. It took 10 years and 15 patents to create the material and extrusion process used today.
Now, the project is at the forefront of fabrication technology in architecture, he said.
“It is significant and important if he succeeds because automation has not been incorporated into construction … virtually everything else [today] is highly automated,” Nutt said.
Contour Crafting has been used at USC in many ways. Students have access to a professor who is “an expert in rapid prototyping techniques … developing a new approach to construction,” Nutt said. Khoshnevis incorporates the technology into his classes both by teaching the concept and by using it as an example.
For USC students, the technology opens up a multitude of possibilities for careers and research, Khoshnevis said. In addition to architectural and engineering careers, Contour Crafting creates careers in fields such as labor relations studies, economics, real estate, policy planning and urban development. Research can be based in the above fields or in materials, software, robotics or architectural design.
“I think it will totally change the construction process … there’s a certain [design] freedom in [expediting the building process],” said Brittany Moffett, a freshman majoring in civil engineering in building sciences.
In the future, the project could solve many of problems found in construction, Khoshnevis said.
“It only uses 25 percent of the energy and eliminates 70 percent of the waste [compared to traditional building methods],” Khoshnevis said.
The project could eliminate many construction-related deaths and injuries by eliminating man-powered construction sites.
It could also speed up the construction process and bring down costs significantly. Khoshnevis said that a building could be built mere days with Contour Crafting, and “the cost of construction will be cut down to one-fourth or one-third of what it is [now].”
He hopes the technology will be used to solve many of the world’s problems, such as speeding up disaster recovery efforts, bringing affordable housing to third world countries or even building in outer space.
“[This is] just the beginning of the process, so I shouldn’t set an end date … it will continue as long as this approach is used,” he said.

Bovard Auditorium was packed Wednesday night with students interested in learning how to “make it big.”
Actor Rob Lowe and real estate mogul Tom Barrack came to USC to speak to students and faculty about “Making Movies, Making Deals and Making it Big,” hosted by the Marshall School of Business.
Words of wisdom · USC alumnus Thomas J. Barrack, CEO of Colony Capital LLC, and actor Rob Lowe discuss personal and professional success in “Making Movies, Making Deals and Making it Big” on Wednesday night in Bovard Auditorium. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Lowe and Barrack, who is the chairman, CEO and founder of Colony Capital, a private equity real estate company in Los Angeles, have recently acquired Miramax Films, along with USC Trustee Ronald Tutor.
“I love the business as much today as I ever did,” Lowe said. “One of the things I love about Hollywood is that there is a grand tradition of people using the platform to transfer their focus into other areas.”
Lowe said he will not be forgoing his television shows and movies, but Miramax will be able to offer him another opportunity in the movie business.
Miramax has a film library of more than 700 movies, including Kill Bill, Good Will Hunting and Pulp Fiction.
“Where you go to bust in this business is thinking that to sweeten that film library you need one more movie,” Barrack said. “After 25 years of investment, the extraordinary returns are always the investments no one else wants to make.”
From his own experience, Barrack said he encourages students to leave their comfort zones.
“You have to be willing to take a big risk and you have to be willing to fail. I never knew where I was going and I still don’t know where I’m going,” Barrack said.
Lowe, on the other hand, said he has known since he was 8 years old that he wanted to be an actor.
“I knew what I wanted to do, but I never had a plan,” Lowe said. “There is no plan. All I know is that I said yes whenever anybody asked me to do something.”
Barrack, an alumnus of USC’s class of 1969, understands a student’s goal to graduate school and have an established name for themselves.
“Students say, ‘I want the best job and I want it to happen tomorrow, but that doesn’t happen,’” Barrack said. “You have to lay the foundation stones and practice the little things like listening and being on time.”
Lowe also cautioned students against comparing themselves and their accomplishments with others.
“Never compare your insides to someone else’s outsides because you don’t know what that guy has going on in his life,” Lowe said. “I only know what I see on the outside.”
Along the same lines, Barrack impressed upon students to think outside the box.
“You have the clubs in your bag, all of those left-brain tools … What I’m here to tell you, the world of the next decade is not going to be run on that,” Barrack said. “It’s going to be run from your right brain — imagination, vision.”
Lowe said passion is a driving force to love what one does on a day-to-day basis.
“Follow your passion. The problem comes if you don’t know what your passion is,” Lowe said. “Find that and you’ll never work a day in your life.”
Students asked questions following the discussion, and the evening ended with a singing performance from Orianthi.
Ryan Park, a junior majoring in public policy, planning and management, said he thought the event’s message was appropriate for students.
“What I enjoyed most about it is that they personify how to be yourself, be nice, be courteous and that whatever good deeds you do will help you in the future,” Park said.

With the opening of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, USC administrators say they still have no concrete plans for The Lot, a temporary food court that was erected during the construction of the campus center.
Empty · The company DormBikes has been using The Lot for storage. Administrators said they have no permanent plans for the space. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan
The Lot, opened in 2008, was home to a food court with quick options such as ZAO Noodle, Red Mango and Wolfgang Puck. It is no longer in operation, but the building is still standing.
USC Hospitality, to whom The Lot was leased, handed the space over to the university in June once campus center construction was complete, USC Hospitality Director Kris Klinger said.
Now that the campus center has replaced The Lot as the central on-campus eating space, the question remains of what will happen to The Lot.
Though not a definite course of action, one option the university is considering is using the building for “surge space,” said Joe Back, associate senior vice president for campus development and facilities management.
“This is essentially space where groups could be moved into temporarily while work is being done on their normal spaces. It would give the university flexibility to be able to move people [around],” Back said.
This could provide USC with a commodity it rarely enjoys: extra space, Back said.
Plans currently include installing additional bicycle parking behind the old kitchen of The Lot, he said.
“Extra bike racks would be good. I have noticed an increase in [bike] traffic around the campus center now that The Lot is closed,” said Anna Lyon, a junior majoring in anthropology.
Currently, the company DormBikes is using The Lot as storage for its bike inventory.
Despite the surge space idea and the addition of bike racks, the future of The Lot still remains very much up in the air.
“There has been no indication of any immediate plans from the university,” Back said. “What is happening now is mostly exterior work, which should be done in about a week or so. My office will be involved with interior renovations once [a final] decision is made.”
Lyon said keeping The Lot open as a food court would help decrease the problems of crowding and traffic at the campus center as well as provide a wider array of food options.
“It would have been good to have both open if each had different kinds of food. [One] could have junk food and the other [could be] more classy,” Lyon said.
However, Eliza Papazian, a sophomore majoring in health and humanity, said she is pleased with the campus center, calling the space an architectural success.
“The campus center is much better [than The Lot], mainly because it’s new and cleaner. It’s more comfortable because there is more seating and space,” Papazian said.
Students are still voicing a variety of concerns, however, about the campus center. Several key complaints included the long lines and crowding, high prices and limited food choices.
“It’s OK, but it doesn’t have Wolfgang Puck, and there aren’t a lot of healthy options,” said Chris Florquist, a senior majoring in economics. “There seems to be a gap between what the campus center serves and what students need. Good, healthy food is difficult to find.”

Special teams.
Just by the name, the unit separates itself from all other units in a team. Yet, despite what your second-grade teacher might say, simply because something appears special doesn’t mean it’s all that special. Special teams is the area on many teams where second- and third-string players get their chance to see some playing time.
That’s how it mostly was under Pete Carroll. Unless a kicker pulls a kick wide, the long snapper snaps the ball over the punter’s head or the return man muffs a punt, the unit remains like Michael Cera — you don’t know he’s there unless something happens to him.
That’s all changed with new coach Lane Kiffin. With him, special teams really is special.
Kiffin wasted no time in making it known that he was going to put a large emphasis on special teams. For the first 30 minutes of the first spring practice, Kiffin had every player participate in special teams drills. Linemen were catching punts and running backs were blocking kicks.
Senior tailback C.J. Gable, senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson and redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo have all said they’ve never spent as much time on special teams as they have this year.
“We got more emphasis on it now,” Johnson said. “It’s a lot better now. Everyone’s paying a lot more attention to detail and everyone’s buying in, and we are just making big plays now.”
The added emphasis has paid off, as already the Trojans have two returned kicks for touchdowns and blocked one field goal. To compare, in the last four years, the Trojans had a combined four kicks returned for touchdowns and it already has two in three games.
“I would challenge that we put more time and dedication into our special teams than anybody in the country and it’s continued to pay off for us three games in a row,” Kiffin said.
Not only has it continued to pay off, but it’s paid off at critical points in all three matches.
The biggest momentum-turning play on special teams happened last week at Minnesota. The Golden Gophers, big underdogs, had just taken the lead in the third quarter, and you know how underdogs work. The longer you let them stick around, the more dangerous they become.
Freshman wide receiver Robert Woods wanted no part in that, so he acted like the bully at school who steps on ants for fun and returned a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. That gave the Trojans a lead they would never relinquish.
Then there was the Virginia game two weeks ago. With 3:49 left in the game, USC had a 17-7 lead, but Virginia was lining up for a 35-yard field goal attempt to make it a one-possession game. The last thing many Trojan fans expected was for Virginia to be within a touchdown that late in the game.
Senior cornerback Shareece Wright made sure that didn’t happen. He twisted off the right side and blocked the kick to preserve the two possession game.
Lastly, don’t forget about Hawai’i, when senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson returned an 89-yard punt, the longest for USC since 1992, in the third quarter to put the Warriors away.
I would argue that without those three plays on special teams, USC would have one or two losses next to its name.
How does this happen? How do you get a team that paid as much attention to special teams as a kindergartner does to broccoli to all of a sudden buy into the fact that the broccoli turned into chocolate?
It’s great coaching by Kiffin and special teams coordinator John Baxter.
“It brings a lot of trust,” Johnson said. “At first, last year a kick return, I didn’t trust it at all. Now Woods is hitting it full steam ahead and coach Baxter really installed a lot into us.”
One person that Baxter needed to buy into the system is Galippo. The redshirt junior was a starting linebacker for the Trojans last year and now his playing time mostly comes on special teams. But instead of complaining about his demotion, Galippo has taken his new role very seriously.
“It’s pretty special,” Galippo said. “Coach Baxter’s a heck of a coach. To be in week three and have two special teams touchdowns, they both came in critical points in the game that completely flopped the momentum — it just shows how important they are and how playing on special teams you’ve contributed to the team.”
For Baxter, this is nothing new. Before coming to USC this year, he spent 13 years as special teams coordinator at Fresno State where he routinely turned out some of the best units in the country.
The Bulldogs led the nation with 49 blocked kicks and punts between 2002-09 and scored 39 special teams touchdowns during Baxter’s time there. For those non-math majors out there (my chemical engineer roommate helped me out here), that means Baxter’s unit averaged three special teams’ touchdowns per year.
“We’re not spending too much time,” Baxter said. “We’re spending what you should spend. They didn’t before. That’s not my fault. I got nothing to do with it. All I can control is what our staff does. You guys are used to watching [a team spend little time on special teams] but I’m not.”
It’s because of Baxter and Kiffin that special teams has become special again at USC.
