The Olympic Games are arguably the greatest sporting events known to humankind. The Summer and Winter Games, which alternate every two years, include athletes from all around the world. These athletes compete in all different types of sports, including fencing, freestyle skating, rugby and bobsledding. 
Most recently, the 2016 Winter Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, drew an audience of 3.6 billion viewers worldwide — almost half the world’s population. Even though the Summer Olympics tend to be more popular than the Winter Games, people from all over the world tune in to see the best athletes for both. It is the one event that allows people from all different walks of life to come together and experience something common: sport.
Usually, immediately after the Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games begin. The Paralympics are similar to the Olympics, but the athletes participating in the former live with disabilities. There are not as many sports played in the Paralympics, but those that are played include snowboarding, archery and wheelchair basketball. 
Unfortunately, after the hype of the Olympic Games, not many people watch or care about the Paralympics. 
I’m guilty of not watching the Paralympics. As a sports fan myself, I enjoy tuning into the Olympics and watching athletes like Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt compete and break records every four years. But once the Olympics finish, I can’t remember a time when I’ve consistently followed the Paralympics like I did the Olympics.
The problem wasn’t that it lacked intrigue. Rather, after already watching two weeks of the same sports in the Olympics, I began to lose interest — especially in the month of August, when baseball teams start to make their playoff push and the NFL preseason begins. 
This last year, I decided to watch the Winter Paralympics on a more consistent basis after having watched the Winter Olympics. It was not long before I realized that athletes with disabilities often have an even harder work ethic and even more determination than the professional athletes I had watched the week before. These athletes perform extraordinarily in their events and deserve as much recognition as any other athlete.
Out of curiosity, I researched the ratings of the Olympics compared to the Paralympics that followed. It was shocking to me that the 2018 Winter Olympics was the least-watched Olympics on record, with fewer than 20 million viewers in America and a 7% drop from the Sochi Winter Olympics.
Shockingly, the 2018 Winter Paralympics broke all international viewing records according to paralympic.org. Compared to Sochi 2014, there was a 27.4% international audience increase for PyeongChang 2018, attracting a cumulative audience total of 1.87 billion people who watched the Paralympics outside of PyeongChang. 
In addition, the 2016 Paralympics were viewed by half a billion people more than the Olympics. Compared to the 3.6 billion viewers who tuned into the 2016 Olympics, the Paralympics drew an unprecedented 4.1 billion people.
For an event that continually failed to match the Olympics in terms of viewership, the 2016 Paralympics smashed the 2016 Summer Olympics out of the water.   
USC is known for producing the most Olympic athletes of any university in America. The Trojans currently have 309 Summer Olympic medals, which, if USC was its own country, would rank 14th on the Olympics’ all-time medal list. 
The University is proud of this achievement — as it should be. Whenever I walk onto Cromwell Field, I pass the tall columns of names of USC athletes who have competed in the Olympics. It reminds me of the school’s outstanding legacy. But when I thought about which USC athletes have competed in the Paralympics, I had a hard time thinking of any at all.
After some research, I understood why. Not one Trojan athlete competed in the 2016 Paralympic games, compared to 44 Trojans who went on to compete in the 2016 Olympics. 
In 2012, after USC sent 41 Trojans to the Summer Olympics in London, Eric Hollen was the school’s sole representative at the Paralympics. Hollen competed in the 10-meter and 50-meter air pistol events. 
Maybe USC just doesn’t have many athletes who are eligible to compete in the Paralympics, but hopefully one day the Trojan family can be proud of athletes who compete in both the Olympics and the Paralympics.
I also hope to see more media attention around athletes with disabilities. It’s clear that the Paralympics have been gaining popularity recently, and it’s time for sports coverage to reflect that. When was the last time you saw more than 10 seconds of Paralympics highlights on SportsCenter? 
Also, people should support athletes with disabilities year-round rather than just a few weeks every two years. Whether that’s going to a wheelchair basketball game at a local YMCA or even volunteering at local Special Olympics events, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved.
It’s definitely encouraging to see the Paralympics gain so much more attention in recent years. Nevertheless, there is still much more that can be done when it comes to recognizing these athletes that train and dedicate themselves to their crafts just like Olympic athletes.

The USC men’s water polo team begins the 2019 regular season this weekend at the Inland Empire Invitational in Claremont and La Verne, marking the team’s first official game action since winning the national title last December. Although it has been over nine months since the championship game, there has been plenty of news and movement within the program.
The most significant change was the turnover at head coach for both the men’s and women’s teams. Longtime head coach and 15-time winner of the National Coach of the Year award for collegiate water polo Jovan Vavic was ousted from the position after he was indicted for a racketeering conspiracy charge in relation to his alleged role in the college admissions scandal. He was accused of accepting bribes totaling more than a quarter million dollars.
Former Athletic Director Lynn Swann announced in August that Marko Pintaric, longtime associate head coach to Vavic, will succeed Vavic as head coach of both teams this year, while longtime assistant coach Casey Moon will take Pintaric’s old position.
“We have very talented and historically successful water polo programs at USC,” Swann said. “We believe Marko will provide the continuity and stability that those programs need to stay at the top of the collegiate water polo world.”
Pintaric has been with the program for 18 seasons and has helped coach the men’s and women’s teams to a staggering 14 national championships in that span.
“This means a lot to me,” Pintaric said. “As a Trojan myself, it’s been a dream to coach at USC, and it’s always been my goal to become a head coach and oversee this program. This is a very special group of men and women who care about each other and the culture here. It is an honor and a pleasure to coach them.”
Not all news has centered around the coaching staff since the men’s team last played. Sophomore driver Hannes Daube and Vavic’s son junior driver Marko won gold with the United States’ men’s national team at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru, this summer. The duo combined for 24 goals over the course of the Games. The team’s victory also qualified the United States for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.
While USC’s women’s water polo team will not begin its season until the spring, the program was also well-represented in Lima. Graduates Joelle Bekhazi and Hayley McKelvey won silver for Canada, while fellow graduate Victória Chamorro played goalie for Brazil which took home bronze. Sophomore driver Paige Hauschild and 2017 graduate Stephania Haralabidis won gold for the U.S. women’s team, which had already qualified for Tokyo previously. 
USC’s men’s team will return its top scorers from the 2018 season — junior driver Jacob Mercep and Daube — who combined to score 120 goals last year, while sophomore goalie Nic Porter enters his second season in the cage.
Daube was named the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation’s Newcomer of the Year while Mercep was recognized as the NCAA Tournament’s Most Valuable Player. The impressive duo received  All-MPSF and All-America first team honors for their production last season and Porter was also given All-America second team distinction.
After an eventful nine months since winning the national championship last December, the men’s water polo team will head into the season as the No. 1-ranked team in the nation. 
The Trojans look to start their season on the right foot against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Saturday at noon.

Just five days ago, USC’s football program was considered hopeless. The shock of sophomore quarterback JT Daniels’ season-ending injuries dissipated and was replaced by talk of head coach Clay Helton’s job security and modest hope that USC would compete with Stanford. 
On Saturday night, USC not only competed with Stanford but embarrassed the Cardinal to the tune of a 45-20 blowout at the Coliseum. Daniels’ replacement, true freshman Kedon Slovis, debuted with 377 passing yards and three touchdowns. His introduction was met with universal praise. 
Despite the buzz, the team remains level-headed at practice. With the first road game of  the season approaching, Helton doesn’t want to focus on headlines — just football. 
New Star, Same Kedon
Over the weekend, Slovis became a sensation. At practice, the new star was quick to redirect the praise. 
“I threw for an 85% completion percentage but that wasn’t because of how well I did,” Slovis said. “It was because of [the wide receivers] giving me a lot of room for error. They give me a lot of security — to be able to throw the ball out there and just let them make plays.”
Slovis didn’t just save his compliments for those on the field, either.
“[Daniels] has been great,” he said. “He’s been a great teammate, especially for what happened to him. He’s facing adversity and trying to do his best for the team.”
 Slovis is taking advantage of his new starting role at practice. During the four-month quarterback battle leading up to the season opener, USC coaches opted for a democratic competition in which all four quarterbacks got the same number of reps each practice. Since becoming the starter, the young quarterback’s reps have increased.  
“I think just a week of practice to get reps with the [starters] was the biggest difference last  week,” Slovis said. “[The game] definitely slowed down and a week of preparation with anyone definitely helps. You just get so many more reps when you’re the starting quarterback.”
The Passing Game
Six wide receivers and two tailbacks caught passes from Slovis Saturday. Even though BYU’s defense is traditionally stout, the Trojans don’t intend on changing their game plan. At practice, redshirt junior wide receiver Tyler Vaughns was not worried about his personal number of touches. 
“Just knowing that we might have 70 snaps a game —  everyone’s going to touch the ball,” Vaughns said after practice Tuesday. “Knowing that you don’t really have to worry about the ball, you just worry about your brother eating and we just all feed off of it.”
BYU is not ranked but is coming off a big weekend after upsetting Tennessee in Knoxville. With a pivotal Pac-12 game against Utah the week after, many view Saturday as a potential trap game for USC.
Coming off a career-high 150 receiving yards against Fresno State, Vaughns emphasized that the passing game’s success over the weekend would not impact their preparation at practice. 
“We just prepare the same,” he said. “We don’t focus too much on the opponent. We just focus on the defense, obviously, and their scheme. We try to do what we do at the easiest pace and at the fastest pace and in the easiest way.”
New Athletic Director
Slovis and the Trojans’ passing game is not the only USC sports headline of the week. Athletic Director Lynn Swann resigned Monday after three years with the Trojans. The news was abrupt and shocked many, but Helton is making sure the team stays focused on the game. 
“We have a job and one of the things you have to realize is that this is USC,” Helton said Tuesday. “This is Los Angeles and this is the second largest media market in the world. Distractions and the lights always come and it’s our job to put it aside and be able to focus on the mission at hand.”

There is a plethora of explanations given for drug addiction: peer pressure,  poor coping mechanisms or simply bad life decisions. Whatever these reasons may be, the common denominator is that addiction is the consequence of voluntary actions. But neuroscience says differently — the truth is that drug addiction is a brain disease as involuntary as having a stroke, and we must change drug criminalization policies to reflect this reality.
The addictive nature of any drug starts with the mesolimbic pathway, more commonly known as the reward pathway. As its name implies, the reward pathway is responsible for reinforcing behaviors that the brain perceives as rewarding. It achieves this by releasing the neurotransmitter dopamine, the “feel good” chemical that creates a sense of pleasure and satisfaction. Normally, we have to work for these dopamine releases, but drugs provide a shortcut. These are the short-term effects that make drugs feel enjoyable, and they help explain why it is difficult to stop after one use.
Repeated drug use fundamentally alters the brain’s structure and chemistry. Excessive dopamine in the brain on drugs results in an amount too overwhelming for our dopamine receptors to handle. In response, the brain begins producing less dopamine, meaning the individual becomes dependent on drugs to supply the neurotransmitter. Conditioning is also at play — just as a dog learns to salivate automatically at the sound of a bell paired with meat, people learn to crave drugs when they are in an environment they associate with drugs.
At this point, drug use is entirely beyond a person’s control. Resisting this urge is not a question of willpower, as doing so results in symptoms like physical pain, hallucinations, depression, and in extreme cases, seizures. These changes persist even after someone stops taking drugs, leaving them craving more.
Given all of this evidence, it seems obvious that drug addiction should be treated as a disease, not a crime. However, many of those addicted to drugs are incarcerated rather than taken to a hospital, as people would be for other brain diseases.
Treating drug addiction requires trained professionals and a series of highly involved intervention methods like behavioral therapy, group treatment and medication. 
Punishment by incarceration without treatment is not an effective means of rehabilitation because it does not treat the neurological roots of the disease, namely dopamine deficiency and unlearning the conditioned dependency on drugs. The social consequences of incarceration, like weakened support groups and joblessness, are factors that put people at a greater risk for substance abuse.
While there are drug treatment programs in prisons, studies have shown that they are insufficient. 
Following the declaration of the War on Drugs, a series of policies has resulted in a tenfold increase in drug-related incarcerations over the course of 1980 to 2010, according to the National Academies In Focus. According to statistics from the Bureau of Prisons, there are over 74,000 people in prison for drug offenses, by far the highest number of all offenses. However, a study by The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University found that there are only enough in-prison rehabilitation programs to properly treat 11% of addicts. 
Consequently, post-prison relapse can be deadly — former inmates are at a significantly higher risk of death by overdose in the two weeks following release. As mentioned, a major contributing factor in substance abuse is environmental stimuli that have conditioned a dependency on drugs. If addicts are being released into the environment where they became addicted in the first place, their brains’ instinctual response will be to get back on drugs. Unsurprisingly, it is not uncommon for addicts to get re-arrested within 12 months of being released, according to the National Institutes of Health. This is a vicious, ineffective cycle, and we must break it with science-driven policies that recognize this issue as a disease. 
Unless prisons suddenly develop a state-of-the-art rehabilitation system that can accommodate the medical needs of millions of drug addicts, it is clear that jail is not the best place for them to go if we truly want to combat this issue.
For decades, scientific evidence that drug addiction is a disease has been mounting, and it is time for our policies to catch up.

The bar to get into many clubs at USC has become dauntingly high — according to executive board members of academic clubs 20, 10, even 5% acceptance rates have become common. Club membership has become far too competitive, which undermines the very purpose of student organizations on campus.
The most obvious downside of hyper-selective clubs is evident in service-oriented clubs.  At the core of these organizations is — at least as stated — the quest to help as many people as possible. In the process, however, these clubs end up eliminating a significant portion of their applicant pool. This is absurd. More active members inevitably lead to more resources, more connections, more high-quality ideas and a bigger workforce to solve problems. 
Granted, some of these students may not have the expected work ethic, but within that number, there are also a multitude of passionate, interested students, who are turned away by often arbitrary admissions decision. Drastically limiting the number of people who can participate is antithetical to altruistic organizations. In the real world, volunteer organizations are not culling a majority of their possible manpower — service organizations, staffed and run by undergraduates, should not prevent such a large portion of students from helping.
The bigger problem, however, is the selection process itself. Clubs have little regulation when picking members: Undergraduate Student Government is hardly an adequate HR department for USC clubs. Clubs are likely unconsciously perpetuating biases in recruiting, a problem that full-fledged companies and organizations (with extensive oversight) still struggle with. Even innocuous-sounding guidelines can be exclusionary — a club selecting for relevant experience, for example, is likely disproportionately accepting students from privileged backgrounds. For example, a hypothetical engineering club selecting for prior coding experience may exclude women who are historically underrepresented in STEM education. And this doesn’t account for more intentional selection errors, as applicants’ hopes are entirely predicated on decisions made by their peers. 
This all raises questions about the ultimate purpose of undergraduate organizations in college.
Clubs are not employers: They exist in a university setting, are staffed by students and do not pay their members. Fundamentally, clubs exist to either equip students with relevant career experience, help the broader community or unite a group of students with similar interests. There’s no reason why any of these goals should be gated by increasingly demanding selection processes.
Some justifications are offered for these cuts. The most selective clubs on campus claim that cuts are needed to maintain a proficient body of students as they are doing important work that requires an educated member base. This is false. Every club, no matter how elite, is made up of students lacking relevant degrees or experience. Taking in an influx of interested, committed students will not impair their abilities in any significant way.
The other common objection is management — too many members means the organization becomes too difficult to manage. This, too, can be solved easily. Clubs should create positions and leadership roles to educate new members and allow them to help in a more limited capacity until they gain enough experience to participate. This is beneficial to everyone: As more students gain experience, organizations get a larger talent pool to draw from and USC produces more experienced graduates. More members will also likely lead to more funds from USG, and more sources for fundraising, allowing clubs to better achieve their goals. 
Student organizations in college should be ways that all undergraduates can find and cultivate interests outside of the classroom. They should not be gated by an obscure, counterproductive and intensely restrictive selection processes.

USC prides itself on its emphasis on the “Renaissance Ideal,” an undergraduate experience centered around interdisciplinary studies. From the Renaissance Scholar distinction and the Thematic Option program to the various combinations of majors and minors made available to students, it’s clear that USC encourages students to be as polymathic as possible. But aside from creating a rich undergraduate experience, interdisciplinary studies shape the way students choose to lead their lives in the most fulfilling manner. We need to debunk the idea that a job will be emotionally fulfilling on its own, and instead uphold USC’s “Renaissance Ideal” as we venture out into the working world. More importantly, we need to take this knowledge with us as we grapple with both personal and societal problems.
In a world where specialized jobs are increasingly popular, many students may find their transition from undergrad to the working world to be tough. According to Gallup, over half of employees are not engaged, meaning they are generally satisfied but not cognitively and emotionally connected to their work. In fact, the number of those who are “actively engaged” drops to 29% for those in the millennial generation. In contrast to the career-oriented, capitalistic Kool-Aid we’ve been drinking since grade school, most people do not find their jobs to be wholly fulfilling. 
To be clear, the idea of being disengaged with work is not a new phenomenon. In the 19th century, Karl Marx wrote all sorts of literature on workers and the alienation of labor. As Marx explained, “The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself.” Historically, labor does not function as a significant part of someone’s identity, but rather as a means to survive and support oneself. And to live a life solely determined by specialized work is to deprive us of our natural curiosity and balance. 
For those who are emotionally invested and satisfied in their work experience, a job may be fulfilling. Those who are truly lucky may be able to find work that incorporates all of their interests. However, for those who are lamenting graduation and finding a way to pursue a more specialized field, it is important to understand — no, embrace — the fact that living an interdisciplinary life is still possible. 
The very notion of humans and scholars as curious beings is what USC’s “Renaissance Ideal” celebrates. It comes from the classic idea of the Renaissance man, or the jack-of-all-trades — someone who is inquisitive, insatiable and skilled in many fields. In fact, during the Renaissance, universities were seen as essential in receiving a well-rounded, “universal” education. Especially now, in a world where job engagement is low and unprecedented environmental and political problems are constantly looming, it is essential that schools like USC continue to abide by this tradition. 
This is all to say that life is and should be interdisciplinary. As such, students should take advantage of all USC has to offer in order to lead well-rounded, varied lives and foster diverse approaches to solving the problems we face. Just as the great thinkers of the Renaissance believed, it is important to have a broad foundation of knowledge to take with you into the world. 
And now, with never-before-seen problems such as global climate change and high-tech automation emerging, we need thinkers who can use this broad knowledge to make change, both in their own lives and on a greater scale.

Just a year ago, the hip-hop community and beyond saw headlines reading “Mac Miller dead at 26.”
The Pittsburgh-born rapper and producer was an ever-changing artist within the hip-hop community. For fans who followed him over the course of his 11- year career, we saw his career transform from frat-rap with singles like “Donald Trump” to albums riddled with prolific, sometimes somber lyricism and jazz-heavy influences. (See “Brand Name” or “God Is Fair, Sexy Nasty” to understand his artistic metamorphosis.)
Beyond his lyrical and production style, what made Miller a unique figure in the genre, what gives reason to a sold-out celebration of life and what explains J.Cole almost coming to tears during a tribute to the late rapper was the way he, a white rapper, lyrically navigated a genre that wasn’t made for him. 
When thinking about Mac’s place in hip-hop, there’s one tweet, written by the legend Jay-Z himself, that stands out: “Too many .. Fab, black people really magic. Mac Miller nice too though.” As HOVA riddled a list of rappers that inspired him back in 2017, Mac, along with Eminem, was the only non-Black rapper.
Without question, there’s something special about Jay-Z, arguably the current apex of hip-hop,  singling out Miller in celebration of a genre created for and by Black people. And when I think about the ways in which other non-Black rappers and artists have engaged with the genre, what stands out about Miller was his commitment to authenticity.
I look to 2010, when his breakout mixtape K.I.D.S. (Kickin’ Incredibly Dope Shit) dropped, where Miller presented himself as a genuine storyteller. He didn’t have to finagle his way into hip-hop with false hardships, gimmicks or by mimicking a certain persona. 18-year-old Mac rapped about skipping school and smoking weed — the teenage experience. 
The tape’s opening lines: “When you’re young, not much matters. When you find something that you care about, then that’s all you got,” were automatically relatable. Lyrics like these were predecessors to later lyrical grapples with fame, addiction, love and recovery; where Mac spoke his truth. 
They speak to the ways in which he used hip-hop — with honesty and vulnerability. We saw Mac grow with each project and he grew without trying to be someone he wasn’t. 
Describing the ways in which the late rapper used the pen authentically may be deemed basic criteria to laud a white rapper, but it juxtaposes the ways in which we typically see non-Black people occupy space in hip-hop. 
Outside of Miller, when thinking about contemporary non-Black rappers and artists in hip-hop culture, my face sours. There’s Rich Brian, who gained notoriety in the game through his former name Rich Chigga — a play on a racial slur. 
There are the Little Dickys and earlier counterpart Riff Raff who make outrageously silly songs to sell records. There’s Australian-born Iggy Azalea who called herself a “runaway slave master” and mimics a southern accent while rapping; and there’s Tekashi 6ix9ine, whose music is saturated with the n-word, along with a host of others who intend to profit off of shock value. 
Although these few don’t represent the breadth of diversity in the genre, we often see non-Black rappers and artists engage in hip-hop by cherry-picking elements of Black culture that aid them in rising to fame, rather than a focus on true lyricism, creativity and authenticity. 
There’s no doubt that there’s space in the genre for non-lyrical rap or gimmicks, we see Black rappers in both arenas. But I often question if Rich Brian would even have a following if his name wasn’t originally Rich Chigga.
I worry whether non-Blackness coupled with cultural appropriation, shock value antics and racial insensitivity have become key to entering the culture — but rappers like Mac and the legacy he left calm nerves. 
Beyond his lyrics, you can Google Mac Miller beside phrases like “the n-word” or “cultural appropriation,” looking to find a flaw but your search will run dry. And over the course of his career, the rapper who shied away from racial discourse became more and more aware of the way his whiteness existed in the genre.  
In a 2016 documentary from “The Fader, Stopped Making Excuses,” Mac laid his privilege on the floor.
“I think I got a benefit from being white,” Miller said. “I think that was a huge boost for me and a guilty thing when I was coming up, like ‘Ah fuck, am I only here because I’m white? Is that the only reason?’”
Mac Miller’s ability to have a successful hip-hop career without offending anybody shouldn’t necessarily be celebrated nor should his acknowledgment of privilege. 
We also shouldn’t celebrate the genre for its acceptance of him, especially with the issues hip-hop has with accepting and respecting the voices of women and the LGBTQ community. But his self-awareness lyrically and racially should serve as a blueprint for those who want to enter the culture from the outside. 
Miller’s career shows us that quality rap music is quality rap. He didn’t have to be anyone but Malcolm, no matter how raw and unpretty that man was, to move people and sell records. 
And that’s why “Mac Miller nice too though.”

Jacqueline Andrews is a self-described people-person. “Mirror,” her new exhibition at the Roski School of Art and Design, showcases a large collection of portraits of faces she has encountered, each with their own story. 
Andrews said she wanted to convey each subject’s personality through her art portraiture.
“I was originally inspired by Yoko Ono’s ‘Book of Instructional Paintings,’” Andrews told the Daily Trojan. “She has one that was called ‘Mirror’ and the instructions said to use other people as a mirror. I was thinking about that when I decided to do this project where I would draw people from life, and they would draw me simultaneously.” 
Andrews, a junior majoring in art and cognitive science, is one of four artists featuring their 2-D art in the Fall 2019 Lindhurst Exhibitions. The Exhibitions will feature artists who specialize in 2-D, 3-D and 4-D work. Throughout the semester, artists will present their work so that fellow colleagues, students and faculty to engage with their art. 
Andrews has been working tirelessly on this project since the summer, stating that her love for people drove the inspiration behind her work. Andrews said she has always been someone who values relationships with family and friends. For her, one of the joys of life is getting to know someone new and finding commonalities with one another. 
“I got home this summer the first day of July, and I started working then, and it was kind of a full-time job all summer,” Andrews said. “There’s 105 pairs, so 211 portraits here, including my self-portrait. Each one of these probably took like three hours plus an hour trying to coordinate and set up.”
When asked why she wanted to take on such a huge, time-consuming project, Andrews said, “One of the reasons I wanted to do this is because I am very people-oriented, I’m very extroverted, I love being around my friends, I love talking to people, meeting new people.”
Although she worked tirelessly on “Mirror,” Andrews’ ultimate passion is, of course, people-oriented. Her mission is to teach others the joy of art through children’s art classes during the summer and to teach high school students during the regular school year. 
Andrews volunteers at “Inner-City Arts,” a campus in Skid Row where schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District who don’t have art classes or the funding for a program take their kids.
Andrews has the desire to encourage others to pursue art as she was highly supported by her parents, who would give her an abundance of art supplies. 
With her love for teaching others about the arts, Andrews also hopes to offer her services in art therapy. “I would love to keep applying my art skills to my career,” Andrews said. “I’m interested in doing therapy in this case, art therapy, because every person that I’ve worked with said it was very refreshing and relaxing. It’s a good way to get out the stress of their day..”
Andrew’s “Mirror” is on display until Sept. 12 in Watt Hall.

College textbooks publishers have a pretty sweet deal in place: Demand is never-ending and required, and supply is barred by copyright laws. It doesn’t take an economics degree to conclude that the result is a monopoly — and ridiculously high textbook prices. 
Textbook prices have increased exponentially at a rate comparable to that of college tuition. Prices have tripled since 1982, even after accounting for inflation, and in 2006, the Advisory Committee for Student Financial Assistance reported that prices rose 186% over the previous eight years.
The College Board budgets book and supply spending to be around $1,200 a year per student. According to the National Association of College Stores, college students actually spend an average of $500 to $700 on textbooks every year.
The reason for the difference in budgeted versus actual spending was in part determined by a U.S. PIRG study, which found 65% of students have skipped buying required texts at some point in their college career because of the lack of affordability. The same study found that 48% of students said the cost of books had an impact on how many or which classes they took.
The reason textbook prices will not change any time soon is because those requiring the textbook — professors — don’t actually have to pay for them. In fact, some professors require students to purchase textbooks they have written, co-written or edited themselves. The status quo results in a win-win for the University and the professors. Professors, like all writers, make royalties off each book purchase, and the University takes a cut of every textbook purchased from the bookstore. Students are the only losers in this deal. 
The only practical solution being discussed is one being dubbed “open-access textbooks.” This term refers to professors searching for copyright-free pages and creating a custom course packet to replace traditional textbooks. The average cost of these packets is $31 — compared to the national average of $153 cost per course. However, only 6% of college faculty members say that they will use this solution within the next three years.
This solution is unlikely to catch fire because of two major roadblock dissenters: booksellers and universities, since they go hand in hand. They profit off students. While they may claim to have an interest in driving down the cost of school supplies, they have a bigger interest in making money off of them. 
According to the National Association of College Stores, 78 cents of every dollar spent on new textbooks goes to publishers. The rest is split between the store’s operating costs and a profit margin. This means that publishers are the main factor in controlling the market price of textbooks. And publishers justify high prices by saying the cost of producing a textbook is upward of $700,000. However, the textbook production market has changed, too. While publishers historically spread out the cost of making a new edition over five years, that time period has shrunk to three years, resulting in higher prices.  
Additionally, the publishing industry consolidated dramatically beginning in the 1980s. Today, just five major publishers — Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster — control over 80% of the market. 
The textbook market is not being treated as it should be: as an antitrust issue. So long as an external factor with no stake in the market does not interject, students will continue to suffer the consequences of being forced to pay ridiculously high prices to companies facing little competition for a product with manufactured demand and protected supply.

The Office of Student Affairs announced a mental health awareness initiative to provide wellness and self-harm education and prevention methods. The announcement sent to the University community Monday comes at the start of National Suicide Prevention Week.
The letter, signed by Vice President of Student Affairs Winston Crisp and Student Health Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman, presents on-campus mental health awareness activities.
It comes shortly after two students died by suicide last week and one student died following a vehicle collision during Welcome Week. 
“While suicide impacts far too many people, evidence shows that taking steps such as providing support services, talking about suicide, reducing access to means of self-harm, and following up with loved ones works,” the letter read. 
The initiative encourages the community to engage in these efforts to aid in suicide prevention and build a better understanding of mental health issues, the letter read. 
“This is an important time to remember those affected by suicide, raise awareness, and offer hope,” it read.
The initiative also incorporates weekly on-campus mental health activities to promote well-being. One of these activities includes Trousdale Outreach and Awareness, a joint effort between Outreach and Mental Health Services and Undergraduate Student Government to provide mental health information and a space for students to connect with others dealing with trauma. The week includes discussions with clinical professionals and  opportunities for students to participate in stress-reduction activities and personal skill-building.
Along with these activities, students can contact USC Student Health to request and organize campus workshops that emphasize mental health awareness and well-being.
The letter also introduced the #BeThe1To campaign as another source of mental health education. Created by the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, the #BeThe1To campaign is a five-step approach students can use to reach out and assist others contemplating suicide. The campaign stresses interpersonal contact, support of others and connection to external mental health resources.
Crisp and Van Orman also acknowledged the impact that recent campus deaths have had on the community, and encouraged those seeking help to reach out to Student Affairs and USC Student Health.
“If you’re hurting for any reason, we want to meet with you. Please know that no one has to struggle alone; we are here for you,” they wrote. “Reaching out for support shows a person’s tremendous strength and courage.” 
Students dealing with mental health concerns can walk in to USC Student Health centers or contact the 24/7 phone line (213) 740-9355 for professional assistance. Faculty and staff members can reach out to the Center for Work and Family Life at (213) 821-0800. Students, faculty and staff members concerned about a fellow Trojan can notify Trojans Care 4 Trojans online or by calling (213) 740-0411.

Former campus gynecologist George Tyndall has surrendered his medical license, according to a news release from the Medical Board of California. The announcement comes two months after the Los Angeles Police Department arrested and charged Tyndall with 29 felony counts, including sexual penetration of an unconscious person and sexual battery by fraud.
According to the Stipulated Surrender of License Order, Tyndall lost all physician and surgeon rights and privileges in California. Though Tyndall’s license had been suspended since August 2018, the board’s decision was officially implemented Thursday. 
“The incidents outlined in the Board’s accusation against George Tyndall are egregious violations,” said Medical Board of California Executive Director Kimberly Kirchmeyer in the news release. “On behalf of California consumers, the Board achieved the highest level of patient protection with the surrender of Tyndall’s license.” 
USC had no comment on the license surrender.
Tyndall has been accused of sexual assault by over 700 former and current USC students — the largest sex-crimes case involving a single suspect in LAPD history. In July, LAPD confirmed that over 130 cases were officially made against Tyndall and that District Attorney Reinhold Mueller would start by pursuing 16 cases. 
In June, Attorney John Manly, who represents more than 200 alleged victims, said the small number of charges is typical of these cases. 
“It’s not unusual for a small number of charges to be brought in these cases … Larry Nassar had 24 charges, and there were over 350 women who came forward initially,” Manly said. “And the reason for that is the statute of limitations. But, I think [Tyndall] is going to have to face the jury and I am confident that the system will do its job.”
Tyndall was found with a .32 caliber two-inch revolver when authorities entered his house with an arrest warrant and has since been hospitalized. Tyndall’s bail is set at $2.1 million and the former gynecologist faces up to 53 years in state prison.
Hundreds of former patients of Tyndall have joined a $215 million class-action settlement since it was preliminarily approved in June. The settlement will provide compensation between $2,500 and $250,000 to those who saw Tyndall between 1989 and 2016.

This weekend, the day we’ve all been waiting for finally arrived: opening Sunday in the NFL. 
Football is back after a seven-month wait — seven months of hypotheticals, baseless predictions, RedZone withdrawals and keyboard warriors who have felt their pedigree is validated by their experience as general managers in Madden franchise mode. 
For some fans, the offseason is a nice relief from weekends of disappointment. Others can’t wait to watch their team get back on the field as soon as possible. Somehow during Week 1, Cleveland Browns fans managed to be part of the latter but quickly came back down to — well, Cleveland — following a blowout loss at the hands of the underwhelming Tennessee Titans. 
As if USC’s victory over Stanford wasn’t enough, Trojan fans got to watch 25 alumni take the field this week in the NFL, and while some were afterthoughts, others played significant roles in their respective team’s contest. 
This week, few Trojans made such an impact as Detroit Lions linebacker Devon Kennard and Seattle Seahawks defensive end Rasheem Green. Kennard sacked Cardinals quarterback and first overall pick Kyler Murray three times, and his play of the game came in overtime on third down. Murray rolled to his right and looked toward the end zone, but all he saw was Kennard running at him like a bull, forcing him to throw it away and settle for a field goal. The Lions were able to match the field goal and end in a tie instead of a loss. Last year, Kennard set his career-high in sacks with seven, and he’s almost halfway to that total after only one week. Green racked up two tackles and the game-clinching strip-sack of Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton with 14 seconds to go.
There was plenty of action in the morning games, including New York Jets  quarterback Sam Darnold and center Ryan Kalil. The Jets offense had a tough time getting going against a stingy Buffalo Bills defense that allowed the fewest passing yards in the NFL last season. Darnold completed 28 of his 41 passes for 175 yards and a touchdown. He was sacked four times and hit nine. Kalil’s offensive line had trouble in the run game as well, as the Jets ran 21 times for only 68 yards and no scores.
On the other side of the ball, Jets defensive end Leonard Wiliams had five total tackles — one to stuff a run on third-and-2 to end a drive — and a quarterback hit as his unit forced four turnovers and allowed only 17 points.
The hometown Los Angeles Rams fielded a trio of Trojans. Leading receiver Robert Woods finished the day with eight receptions for 70 yards, including a 22-yard catch-and-run on third-and-8 at the end of the first quarter, as well as two carries for 16 yards. On the defensive side, linebacker Clay Matthews had three total tackles with a sack and a quarterback hit, while cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman added two tackles of his own. The Rams held on for a 30-22 win. 
Dallas Cowboys offensive tackle Tyron Smith did a fantastic job protecting quarterback Dak Prescott’s blindside, as Prescott was not sacked once in a win over the division-rival Giants.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Ronald Jones II achieved a personal career-high with 75 rushing yards on 13 carries against the San Francisco 49ers. Jones put up impressive numbers in his junior year at USC  — 1,737 yards and 20 touchdowns from scrimmage  — before being selected 38th overall in the 2018 draft. He’s looking to build off of a subpar rookie season during which he played only six games, and he’s already topped his total rushing numbers from last year on Sunday.
Tennessee Titans defensive end Everson Griffen had one sack and two quarterback hits, while defensive tackle Jurrell Casey and Chargers linebacker Uchenna Nwosu each picked up one tackle. Titans cornerback Adoree’ Jackson had five tackles but watched an interception slip through his hands off a tipped pass on the first play of the game. Meanwhile, in an NFC East showdown, Eagles wide receiver Nelson Agholor was hauled in just two passes for 11 yards — a slow afternoon for him.
Fan-favorite Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster got his first opportunity as the guy in Pittsburgh Sunday night under the lights of Gillette Stadium, a massive stage for the Steelers to prove their offensive talent even without stars running back Le’Veon Bell and wide receiver Antonio Brown.
Instead, what followed was a story of their ineptitude. The Steelers embarrassed themselves in a 33-3 trouncing. Smith-Schuster had a modest game with six receptions for 78 yards, but it hardly mattered, as Pittsburgh was only able to get on the board with a field goal in the third quarter. 
As Smith-Schuster adjusts to his new high-pressure role with plenty of national attention — due partly to the Antonio Brown drama and to his high-profile character — he should settle in and begin dominating games as he did last season. Not facing the defending Super Bowl champions should help in future weeks, too.

With this weekend’s wins against Northern Arizona and Nebraska, USC’s women’s soccer has started 6-0 for the first time in program history, jumping from No. 4 to No. 2 in the nation.
The Trojans started the weekend with a 3-0 win against NAU in their Friday home opener at McAlister Field. USC struggled to start play, holding possession for the majority of the first half but failing to score as the Lumberjacks kept a bend-don’t-break attitude. 
Still, the Trojans coaching staff made key adjustments at the half and it only took 37 seconds for them to go into effect. Sophomore forward Penelope Hocking fired a shot into the far corner of the goal, and the Trojans took a 1-0 lead. 
Head coach Keidane McAlpine said it has taken some time for the Trojans to gain momentum, noting how the team has been adjusting after first halves recently.
“They’re not used to these styles of both of the teams we played,” McAlpine said after the game. “They threw some things at us that were a little different, so it took us a little bit to try to get our feet under us. We found our way in the second half once we kind of knew what we wanted to do and how to adjust to what they were doing.” 
USC would get 2 more goals in the afternoon: 1 from star junior forward Tara McKeown in the 68th minute and another from senior forward Taylor McMorrow in the 83rd. 
Midfielders Daria Petredes, Jalen Woodward and Ashleigh Plumptre, defender Julia Bingham and forwards McMorrow and Natalie Jacobs were all honored for senior day before their win against Nebraska. 
It was a similar start for the Trojans on Sunday as Nebraska seemed to put the pressure on USC from the opening whistle. The Cornhuskers pressured the Trojans’ back line and forced USC to play the long ball, but with senior goalkeeper Aubrei Corder playing so far off her line, it was difficult for USC to get anything going offensively to open the match. 
Coach McAlpine praised the Cornhuskers for their first half performance. 
“Their pressure was really good,” he said. “They’re a very good team, very organized, they know how to battle, they know how to compete, so the first adjustment was to match the competitive level.”
It did take a while for the Trojans to match that intensity, but in the 39th minute McKeown found Hocking, who then found the back of the net as the Trojans took a 1-0 lead. 
USC came out looking more comfortable facing Nebraska’s play style for the second half, as the Trojans controlled the flow of the game for the rest of the match.  
“We did a much better job in the second half,” McAlpine said. “We wanted to serve the ball a little bit more into that back line, force them to deal with that first one, pick up the second ball and then be able to play from there.”
Hocking, last year’s Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, added her fifth goal of the season in the 53rd minute with another assist from McKeown as USC took a 2-0 lead. Hocking had a couple of opportunities for a hat trick but was unable to push one more past the Cornhuskers, ending the game with a 2-0 shutout.
Sophomore goalkeeper Anna Smith recorded the first two shutouts of her career on the weekend, continuing her excellent play in the place of injured redshirt junior Kaylie Collins. 
USC received great play from their defense all weekend, but the story around this year’s team remains the same: its forwards. 
McKeown added 1 goal and two assists this weekend, surpassing her goal total from last year before Pac-12 play even begins and continues to lead USC in assists. Hocking has 5 goals to her name along with three assists as the duo continues to dominate the pitch. 
The team’s coach praised the pair after the weekend sweep. 
“We’ve got two of the best forwards in the country and we knew that they were going to be able to break [opponents] down,” McAlpine said. “Their work rate is phenomenal [and so is] their chemistry with each other. They are both very explosive, very good finishers, but their chemistry with each other makes them even more dangerous than normal.”
The Trojans will hope to continue their perfect start as they travel up to Seattle University to take on Redhawks for a 7 p.m. kickoff Friday.

Welcome to overreaction week in the NFL! After many long months of waiting for some meaningful game action, it’s time for premature conclusions based a one-game sample for each team. This week, I’ll be diving into the results from Week 1 (ranked from most surprising to least) and drop predictions for the NFL season. 
Titans 43, Browns 13
The Browns’ offseason hype got Thanos-dusted on Sunday. Titans rookie receiver A.J. Brown sparked the offense and three Baker Mayfield interceptions helped the Titans seal the game. I’m holding out hope for Cleveland, but it might not yet be a Super Bowl contender. On the other hand, Tennessee has found new hope; maybe this is the year Marcus Mariota stays healthy and lives up to his potential. (Surprise meter: 9/10)
Vikings 28, Falcons 12
The Vikings shut out the Falcons through three quarters, blocked a punt, Dalvin Cook looked electric with the ball and Kirk Cousins only had to attempt 10 passes in the blowout. You have to wonder if the Falcons made a mistake firing Steve Sarkisian and replacing him with Dirk Koetter. I’m still a believer in the Falcons’ talent, but they looked asleep on the field Sunday as the Vikings asserted themselves as the team to fear in the NFC North. (Surprise meter: 8.5/10)
Packers 10, Bears 3
Thursday’s opener was an upset, but Aaron Rodgers beating the Bears is nothing new. He’s 17-5 against them in his career. The bigger surprise is that both offenses stalled for the entirety of the game. The burden of proof still rests on Matt LaFleur and Mitch Trubisky to get their respective offenses going. I think this game dampens both teams’ high expectations. (Surprise meter: 6.5/10)
Eagles 32, Redskins 27
It was shocking to see the Eagles down 17-0 in the second quarter, but as soon as Carson Wentz hit DeSean Jackson for his first of two 50+-yard touchdown receptions, it was clear they’d come back for the win. Good luck stopping this Eagles team — they’re stacked on both sides of the ball. Despite the loss, the Redskins showed the upside to steal a few games this season. (Surprise meter: 4.5/10)
49ers 31, Buccaneers 17
Jameis Winston and Jimmy Garoppolo combined for three pick-sixes, and each team had multiple touchdowns called back on penalties. It doesn’t get much uglier, and I don’t see either of these teams keeping up with the NFC’s contenders. (Surprise meter: 4.5/10)
Seahawks 21, Bengals 20
The Seahawks were 9.5-point home favorites in this one, and the Bengals played them surprisingly close. This may be receiver John Ross’ breakout year, but the Bengals’ outlook is still bleak. The Seahawks will need to sharpen up to beat tougher opponents in the coming weeks. (Surprise meter: 4/10)
Patriots 33, Steelers 3
The biggest shock surrounding the Patriots is the addition of Antonio Brown. Dominating the Steelers like this is just icing on the cake. Don’t be surprised when the Patriots are playing home games in January. (Surprise meter: 4/10)
Bills 17, Jets 16
A big day for Bills receiver John Brown helped decide a sloppy game for both teams. I remain skeptical of the Jets’ offense thanks to Adam Gase’s questionable track record. The Bills still lack the roster depth to challenge the Patriots for an AFC East crown. (Surprise meter: 3.5/10)
Chiefs 40, Jaguars 26
Collarbone injuries knocked out new Jags quarterback Nick Foles and Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill, reigning MVP quarterback Pat Mahomes played through a sprained ankle, and Jags linebacker Myles Jack was ejected for throwing a punch. Otherwise, this game produced few surprises as Chiefs receiver Sammy Watkins erupted for nearly 200 yards and three touchdowns in Hill’s absence. Jags backup quarterback, rookie Gardner Minshew, played surprisingly well, but Foles’ injury still hurts their outlook for the season. The Chiefs are firmly entrenched as Super Bowl contenders. (Surprise meter: 3.5/10)
Rams 30, Panthers 27
The Rams managed to come away with the road win despite limited usage for runningback Todd Gurley. The Panthers looked good, but quarterback Cam Newton might not be back to 100% yet from his preseason foot injury. Expect both teams to play meaningful games as the season winds down in December. (Surprise meter: 3/10)
Chargers 30, Colts 24 (OT)
The Colts should be pleasantly surprised at taking Chargers down to the wire. Chargers runningback Melvin Gordon’s holdout is something to keep an eye on with the Chargers, but Austin Ekeler was excellent in his place. (Surprise meter: 3/10)
Cardinals 27, Lions 27 (OT)
The Cardinals offense flashed potential in the fourth quarter, but the Lions should still be embarrassed to have tied a team with so little talent on its roster. It’s going to be a long season for fans of both teams. (Side note: When is the NFL going to eliminate ties?) (Surprise meter: 2.5/10)
Ravens 59, Dolphins 10
Everyone knows the Dolphins are tanking; the surprise is how well Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson threw the ball and receiver Marquise “Hollywood” Brown exploded in his debut. The Ravens looked like AFC North favorites, but let’s wait and see how they look against more respectable teams. (Surprise meter: 1.5/10)
Cowboys 35, Giants 17
The Cowboys’ offense looked much more potent under the direction of new offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, and they could be a threat to win the NFC. (Surprise meter: 1.5/10)
AFC Predictions
Division winners: Patriots, Chiefs, Ravens, Texans
Wild Cards: Chargers, Browns 
NFC Predictions
Division winners: Eagles, Rams, Saints, Vikings
Wild Cards: Cowboys, Panthers
Super Bowl Prediction 
It hurts to pick the Evil Empire, but the addition of Antonio Brown makes the Patriots unstoppable. They’ll get their revenge on the Eagles for Super Bowl 52, and Tom Brady will win his seventh ring.
