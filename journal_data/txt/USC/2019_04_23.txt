The regular season is over and both the men’s and women’s tennis teams are heading to Ojai, Calif. for the Pac-12 Tournament. The men enter as the No. 2 seed while the women will come in as the No. 4 seed.
After winning nine consecutive matches in the middle of the season, the women’s team has gone 4-4 over its last eight games and lost three of its last four matches. Still, with an overall record of 17-6 and a conference record of 7-3, the Trojans finished fourth in the Pac-12, a major improvement on their eighth-place finish the year before.
Most recently, the Trojans fell to UCLA. In what was a hard-fought match by both sides, USC and UCLA tied for singles wins, only for UCLA to sweep doubles play to clinch its eighth conference win of the season.
Currently ranked No. 15 in the nation, the women’s team still has a lot to look forward to as it heads into the Pac-12 Championships. USC has the No. 4 doubles team in the nation made up of junior Angela Kulikov and senior Rianna Valdes. 
“This is something we’ve been talking about for awhile,” Kulikov said. “When the preseason rankings came out, they had us at 42 and we just kind of looked at each other and said, ‘This is unacceptable, we’re not gonna take this, we’re going to show them.’ It’s been a big goal for us. We’ve had to climb our way up the rankings, but we definitely see ourselves as top contenders.”
In addition to the duo, USC has the No. 52 singles player in the nation in freshman Salma Ewing.
The Pac-12 Championships will be no walk in the park. The three teams ahead of USC — Stanford, Washington and UCLA — have all defeated the Trojans this season. If the Trojans hope to make a deep run in the tournament, they will have to rely on the likes of Ewing and Kulikov to carry them. 	
The men finished the Pac-12 regular season with 4-2 wins over Arizona and Arizona State. They finished second to UCLA in the conference following a 4-3 loss to the Bruins on April 5.
USC finished the regular season with a 17-7 overall record and a 7-1 Pac-12 record, ending the season on a four-match win streak. They are ranked No. 10 in the country.
The Trojans appear set for a third consecutive Pac-12 Tournament final against UCLA, as the two teams were easily the best in the conference this season. After losing to the Bruins in the final last year, the Trojans will look for revenge at Libbey Park. 
Since the Pac-12 introduced the year-end tournament in 2012, there have only been two winners. USC has won three times and UCLA has won four. The rivals look to continue their dominance over the tournament.
USC will take on Washington in the quarterfinals. The Trojans defeated the Huskies 4-0 on the road earlier this year and will look to continue their dominance this time around.
The men’s tennis team looks to avenge its championship match loss last season, while the women’s team seeks its first Pac-12 championship since 2015. The women take on Cal at 9 a.m. Thursday, and the men face Utah at 3 p.m.

The NFL Draft is the sports event of the year.
Don’t get me wrong, I live for the NHL playoffs, count the days until the start of college football season and will watch all or part of at least 130 Tampa Bay Rays games each year. I am nothing if not a well-balanced sports fan, but there is nothing quite like the NFL Draft.
This time of year captivates the curious fan. The armchair GMs, a bevy of mock drafts, supposed “insider” information about every team’s draft plans — ’tis the season for speculation and drama, and this weekend it will culminate in three beautiful days of madness where every so-called expert will have their validity shaken and mind blown.
While common sentiment these days holds that NBA free agency is the most exciting part of the sports offseason, there is no other league that can command attention for roster transactions quite like the NFL Draft.
The trades, steals, slides and the much-talked about overdraft all combine to create a beautiful concoction of heartbreak, elation and (for every team) a sense of hope.
For years, I felt a sense of small pride as an amateur mock drafter. While every fan across the nation believes they know what may happen or has ideas about who their team should draft, each year these assumptions are tossed right out the window.
This draft promises to be just as hectic and unpredictable as ever. An MLB draftee turned Heisman champion, a veritable treasure trove of talent at pass rusher, the NFL’s highest rising position and a collection of teams that are bound to trade away the farm to ensure they have found their quarterback of the future. Rest assured, this will be a draft for the history books.
All this said, it is worth noting that there will be at least one thing notably different about this draft as compared to past years: USC will not be making headlines.
Heading into the draft, the Trojans lead the way among all college programs with 506 all-time NFL draft picks. Carrying a narrow seven-man lead over rival Notre Dame, USC has managed to create an undeniable legacy of matriculation to the game’s highest level comparable to some but beat by none. Add on the fact that the Trojans also lead the way with 81 first-round picks, and it’s clear that USC is just as good if not better at feeding the NFL as it is at winning at the college level.
Come the first night of the draft this Thursday, however, it is not just possible but extremely likely that the Trojans go all night without hearing a name called. In fact, the pick-less streak could very well extend into day three as USC’s seemingly endless NFL prospect pool has, rather quickly, shallowed out. After seeing four players (Sam Darnold, Adoree Jackson, Leonard Williams and Nelson Agholor) selected in the first round over the last four drafts, it is likely that the Trojans will miss out on not only a first-round pick but even a second-round selection. 
In his latest mock draft, NFL.com draft analyst Chad Reuter projects tackle Chuma Edoga to be the first USC player off the board at No. 80 overall, a third-round pick. While Edoga’s accomplishments at USC as a consistent starter and one of the Pac-12’s best offensive linemen shouldn’t be minimized, a selection at this spot would represent the latest start for USC’s NFL Draft since cornerback Kris Richard was picked 85th in the 2002 draft.
With cornerback Iman Marshall projected as a fourth-round pick and linebackers Porter Gustin and Cameron Smith projected to be fifth-round picks, the four-man class would represent a significant drop off from a year ago when that many Trojans were off the board by the 79th pick.
This isn’t to mention that strong contributors such as safety Marvell Tell, center Toa Lobendahn and running back Aca’Cedric Ware may not be drafted at all despite being among the Pac-12’s strongest at their positions in 2018.
Prior to the 2018 season, Marshall and Smith were considered second-round picks by publications such as USA Today  with the strong possibility of jumping up into the first round while Gustin and Tell were on the second round bubble. In fact, Marshall and Smith were listed as possible first-round picks in early 2018 mock drafts, but even after electing to stay in college an extra season, their draft stocks dropped nonetheless.
While mock drafts are anything but gospel — Reuter whiffed on each of the first 12 picks of his final 2018 mock and only correctly predicted three of the first 32 — they give a strong impression of where a player’s stock lies relative to the opinions of both analysts and active NFL scouts. 
This year, the draft will have the usual abundance of interesting storylines. In the case of USC’s draft presence in 2019, it seems that a once-sterling seal of excellence may have been diminished. Whether by down seasons from draft-eligible players, program instability or a lack of quality in recent USC pros, this may be the beginning of a downward trend for Trojan prospects.

The USC baseball team won two out of three home games against Washington State over the weekend, with the final game ending in a tie.
USC opened the series Thursday with a 4-0 win. The Trojans took an early 1-0 lead in the bottom of the second inning when redshirt junior catcher CJ Stubbs scored on a single from junior right fielder Brady Shockey.
This score proved to be all they needed that night. Junior pitcher Connor Lunn put up a dominant performance for USC, hurling a complete game shutout while surrendering just four hits and no walks.
Lunn said he had been battling illness in the days before his start, but it didn’t seem to affect him on the mound. He lowered his earned run average to 2.3 on the season — the best mark on what has at times been a shaky USC starting staff.  
The Trojans tacked on another run in the third inning on a groundout by sophomore third baseman Ben Ramirez, scoring senior shortstop Chase Bushor.
In the eighth, USC gave Lunn a cushion by adding 2 more runs. Junior first baseman John Thomas singled in Ramirez and an error later in the inning scored Stubbs for the 4-0 lead.
The Trojans had 11 hits Thursday, including two each from Shockey, freshman first baseman Clay Owens and junior left fielder Blake Sabol.
On Friday, USC jumped ahead early and maintained a big lead en route to a 10-1 victory. Junior center fielder Matthew Acosta’s RBI single scored Stubbs for a 1-0 lead in the first inning. USC added 5 runs in the second inning, highlighted by 2-run singles from Stubbs and Acosta.
“[The early lead] takes away Washington State’s offense,” Stubbs said. “They want to get guys on base and move them over with the bunt and hit-and-run, because they’ve struggled offensively … by taking that away, we allow our defense to just go to work.”
Junior second baseman Tyler Pritchard scored Owens on a sacrifice fly in the third inning, his second RBI of the game. After a fourth inning RBI single by Ramirez and sacrifice fly by Bushor, the game was well out of reach at 9-0. Freshman designated hitter Preston Hartsell’s RBI fielder’s choice in the fifth gave the Trojans their 10th and final run of the game.
“I thought we were pretty relentless,” head coach Dan Hubbs said.
Sophomore pitcher Isaac Esqueda started the game with six scoreless innings for USC. Pitchers sophomore Kyle Hurt, junior Austin Manning and freshman Calvin Schapira each threw one inning. WSU’s lone run came on a passed ball in the eighth inning.
“It’s just basically getting the curveball for a strike on a 1-1 or 0-0 count,” Esqueda said of slowing the Cougars’ bats. “Just having that good command on 0-2 just to put them away, getting it over just to get ground balls and have my defense behind my back [helping] me out.”
Saturday’s game wasn’t quite as smooth, ending in a 10-10 tie after the 12th inning. Sophomore designated hitter Jamal O’Guinn gave the Trojans a 2-0 lead in the first inning on a 2-run homer to right-center field, but the Cougars piled on 6 runs in the third against freshman pitcher Carson Lambert. WSU had six hits in the inning, including a grand slam.
The teams traded 2-run innings in the sixth to put the Cougars up 8-4.
WSU increased its lead to 5 runs in the ninth inning. What seemed then like a meaningless run proved crucial.
USC strung together three consecutive singles to load the bases with one out in the ninth. Stubbs hit a pinch-hit 2-run single to cut the lead to 3. Sabol became the tying run with an RBI single. Ramirez later came to the plate with the bases loaded, down a run with two outs in the ninth.
Ramirez was hit in the leg with a pitch, scoring Sabol to complete the improbable comeback. WSU got out of the inning, and the teams headed for extras.
“The kids believe in each other,” Hubbs said of the rally. “They’ve done it enough that they believe they can do it again.”
The Cougars went down 1-2-3 in the 10th. In the bottom half, Hartsell aggressively tried to score from second on an error but was thrown out at the plate to end the inning.
After another 1-2-3 inning in the top of the 11th, O’Guinn was picked off at second with two outs to send the game to the 12th.
WSU took a 10-9 lead on a suicide squeeze in their half. Again, USC answered back. Shockey’s RBI double tied the score at 10. The Cougars escaped the inning, and in somewhat anticlimactic fashion, the game was ruled a tie due to travel restrictions for Washington State.
Still, the Trojans took the series, moving to 17-20-1 overall and 8-9-1 in Pac-12 play. USC will host UC Irvine at Dedeaux Field Tuesday at 6 p.m. The Anteaters are 25-9 and are 6-1 against Pac-12 teams this season.
“We’re going to have to bring it because they’ve been beating a lot of really good teams,” Hubbs said of the Trojans’ upcoming match against the Anteaters.

Where would we be without film? I don’t mean that in a figurative sense, I mean where would we literally be without film’s ability to transport us places we would never go and insert us into times we never experienced? Through movies, though our bodies remain stationary, our senses are teleported away. Without film, our minds would be confined to their basic schemas of thought, limited in experience. Critic Roger Ebert called movies an “empathy machine” that allows us to live in another’s shoes — but more than that, movies are teleportation and time machines. With the rise of musician biopics and “event” films like Beyoncé’s Netflix debut “Homecoming,” film is embracing its transportational abilities. 
“Homecoming” primarily documents Beyoncé’s now-iconic performances at Coachella 2018. Although the energy mainly comes from the performance itself, “Homecoming” is simply an expertly made film. It intercuts between the performance and the preparation that led up to it, offering a holistic view of the sweat and tears that resulted in an unprecedented triumph. 
Narrated by the superstar herself, the behind-the-scenes snippets show the unfathomable amount of planning that she had to curate in the months leading up to the festival. Beyoncé, who had just given birth, weaved in and out of three enormous sound stages each dedicated to a part of the performance: dancing, music and production design. She not only dictated every detail of every costume and prop, but also trained harder than any of her dancers while raising her newborn twins. All this, and she managed to pull off one of the defining performances of our time. “Homecoming” is a showcase of excellence. 
It’s also another step in the growing trend of concert and “event” movies. Last year, “Bohemian Rhapsody” raked in millions at the box office, hailed (pretty much only) for its frame-for-frame depiction of Queen’s 1985 Live Aid performance. At the start of this year, “Apollo 11” showed us what it was like to witness the moon landing as if we were living it; a few weeks ago, “Amazing Grace” took us to New Temple Missionary Baptist Church to watch Aretha Franklin give a taste of what heaven sounds like; and later this year, “Rocketman” will tell Elton John’s tale and recreate his most famous performances. Movies have always been a reflection of our culture’s fears and longings, and today, it seems like we all want to say, “I was there.” These movies promise an out-of-body experience.
In our celebrity-saturated culture, we idolize figures like Freddy Mercury, Aretha Franklin and Beyoncé because, if we’re honest, we think they’re more than human. In one humorous but touching “Homecoming” moment, Beyoncé throws a towel to a desperate fan who proceeds to hyperventilate and tear up as if he received a holy relic from the Queen herself. I’d say this isn’t an overreaction at all; we elevate these famous personalities to unreachable heights. Nowadays, we want to see them up close, we want to be there — and now we can — through the screen. But, a danger lurks beneath the allure of watching Live Aid or Aretha Franklin as if we were there. 
Watching great artists perform, we are subject to the erroneous belief that we must have the spotlight to be successful. If we don’t get all the attention, is it because we aren’t doing anything noteworthy with our lives? Who gets to say if our lives, if our art matters anyways? “Homecoming” offers pounds of hope and encouragement, but with one message in particular resonated with me, one that manifested when the film drew our attention elsewhere — (believe it or not) away from Beyoncé. 
When the film cuts away from Beychella, we get to see all the hard work Beyoncé put into the show, but it’s work that would have been impossible without her team. Beyoncé isn’t the only excellent artist on display: There are hundreds flawlessly performing behind her. Toward the conclusion, we are shown snapshots of many of these performers: each one a story, each one a face just as important as the one they’re supporting. 
As we witness the concert and event films that are surely to follow — as we get to see celebrities we regard as borderline demi-gods grace our screens —  let’s not just praise the talent of the principal artist but be inspired to create great things ourselves, knowing they have worth regardless of whether we get our own Netflix special or not.

While there weren’t as many celebrity or influencer sightings as its first iteration of the year, Weekend 2 of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was full of unique, groundbreaking moments that made the weekend-long extravaganza just as special the second time around. 
In the last few years, Coachella’s brand as a festival has undergone a complete tonal shift, and for good reason. For its first 15 years, music fans and festival junkies alike saw Coachella as the ultimate festival tastemaker — and heralded it as a rite of passage for up-and-coming artists.  
It’s hard to pinpoint what year this all changed, but the festival’s growth into the full-fledged annual spectacle it is today has not come without a tainted reputation. Now in its 20th year, the festival reportedly hauls in over $100 million in profits annually, and even its cheapest ticket has soared to over $400. 
To many, this annual bidding war for admission to live music’s most exclusive event has edged out the people and spirit that made Coachella special in the first place. Those people are no longer heading to the Empire Polo Club in Indio, Cal. — rather, they’re following along on Twitter or streaming it on YouTube.
In many ways, the Moment in Music that was “Beychella” provided the perfect case study for what your favorite snarky tweeter might dub the “affluenza Olympics.” Last week, Beyoncé released “Homecoming,” a documentary film and 40-track live album that chronicles her historic headlining performances at Coachella 2018. The production value and stage design was one of the most ambitious in the history of live performance, and, through the eyes of the internet, the crowd in attendance neither appreciated nor deserved to witness a performance of this magnitude.
Multiple major publications emphasized this shift in their coverage of the first weekend. Each had a different way of relaying it, but the sentiment remained the same: Coachella has become corporatized and built for broadcast. It’s no longer about the experience; it’s about the clout that comes with attending one of the biggest cultural events of this generation. 
However, Weekend 2 felt nothing like how it was described by many media outlets. Some of the observations were blatantly present: the Instagrammable artwork and over-the-top stage production, to name a few. But something felt different. It didn’t feel like an exclusive club for privileged millennials and Gen Z’ers — it felt like an intimate festival. For the most part, the crowd danced and sang along to the music, and the energy was palpable from the start. 
With daytime temperatures pushing 100 degrees, the opening day of Weekend 2 came with its own set of challenges. Despite the torrid heat that persisted throughout the day, festival attendees were still able to enjoy the event, as thousands packed the Empire Polo Club to see their favorite artists. 
Baltimore-based rapper-producer JPEGMAFIA took the Outdoor Theatre at the hottest time in the afternoon. With the brutal desert sun beating down on an exposed crowd, JPEGMAFIA, known for his high-energy, mosh-inducing live performances, encouraged the crowd to drink water and take it easy if they needed to. Still, his advice didn’t stop an enthusiastic crop of fans from losing their minds.
While The 1975 and Kacey Musgraves attracted loyal fans, emerging acts U.S. Girls and King Princess delivered quirky performances. In addition, BLACKPINK and Calypso Rose made history as the first K-pop group and oldest artist to ever perform at Coachella, respectively. Childish Gambino and Janelle Monaé rounded out the evening with amusing and intimate performances of the main stage.
Saturday was witness to arguably one of the best sets of the weekend. After facing technical errors that delayed her set by 40 minutes the previous week, anti-pop sensation Billie Eilish killed Weekend 2 with a career-defining performance that why she is currently the biggest name in music. Theatrical and spooky in true Billie fashion, the 17-year-old owned her edgy persona and packed the Outdoor Theatre to capacity (if that was even possible). Thousands of fans chanted along to every lyric, from “Bad Guy” to “Ocean Eyes.” No performer — not even Saturday’s headliner Tame Impala — garnered the same fan engagement that Eilish did.
On the final day of Coachella 2019, over 50,000 attendees arrived early to witness Kanye West’s Sunday Service — a Weekend 2 exclusive celebrating Easter Sunday. The two-hour show, albeit highly anticipated, left crowds weary and dehydrated. Despite being held atop a hill, many attendees were unable to see West in action and some were even more disappointed upon learning that the rapper was selling $50 socks and $225 sweatshirts. 
While Sunday got off to a rough start, the festival continued to wow attendees with a variety of art, music and food. Norwegian band Boy Pablo brought life to the Gobi tent, captivating fans with live renditions of its bedroom pop hits as well as covers of “Party in the U.S.A.” and “Afternoon Delight.” Lead singer Nicolas Pablo Muñoz and keyboardist Erik Tryland even took off their shirts at the behest of eager fans. Lizzo preached to a lively crowd late Sunday afternoon, and Gesaffelstein fused performance art with electronic in his DJ set. The event concluded with a much improved performance by Ariana Grande, who brought out Justin Bieber for a surprise performance of his song “Sorry.” 
At Weekend 2,  more artists brought out special guests, a spectacle that was previously considered a Weekend 1 privilege. For example, Zedd had Maren Morris and Alessia Cara and  Khalid jammed alongside John Mayer Sunday. Saturday saw Vince Staples supporting Billie Eilish and Tame Impala kept the mood trippy with A$AP Rocky. And on Friday, Jaden Smith brought his dad Will Smith to work during his performance of “Icon.”
Curiously enough, several artists informed festival-goers that the audience participation was much better than Weekend 1. Tierra Whack concluded her set by telling her enthusiastic crowd that they were far better than last week’s. Friday headliner Childish Gambino even admitted this to the crowd and asked that they keep it a secret.
Sorry, Donald Glover, but the secret is out. The spirit of Coachella still lives on in the hearts of many and, for anyone who still needs convincing, the second weekend is the time to go.

The lengths to which the USC administration will go to avoid the consequences of its own negligence and moral apathy are unbelievable. 
In another betrayal to survivors, USC is currently the sole opponent of California Assembly Bill 1510, which would extend the period to file claims “arising out of sexual assault or misconduct by a physician occurring at a student health center” for one year starting Jan. 1, 2020. Plainly, this bill would allow survivors of former campus doctors Dennis Kelly and George Tyndall to claim legal damages from USC, even if the statute of limitations had already expired. AB 1510 expands the net of justice for victims of USC-sponsored sexual assault. 
Supported by consumer, civil rights and women’s groups, and opposed only by USC, AB 1510 is crucial to ensuring that all survivors receive adequate compensation and that the state and courts hold this University fully accountable for its gross negligence and indifference toward the victims of its campus doctors’ misconduct. 
Not only did the administration ignore survivors for years, but it is now actively working to silence their voices and revoke their justice. Survivors have surely endured enough trauma and hardship. This legislative battle is not only insulting in its blatant self-preservation, but it is also completely futile, as AB 1510 will almost certainly pass. USC’s ardent opposition is transparent in its frivolity: This is not about justice, but about greed. This is not about accountability but about preserving the University’s good name.
USC decries the bill as “a blatant attempt to interfere with the proposed federal settlement and all the beneficial provisions found within the settlement,” yet the United States District Court of Central California just denied a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement because “The Court would be concerned about class members being misled into believing that their award will be higher than their actual amount of compensation received.” While the District Court ensures that USC will be honest about the amount it is willing to give survivors, isn’t it imperative that other survivors have ample opportunity to seek justice themselves? 
The two legal actions are not in opposition to one another, despite USC’s claim that they are. And it is very telling that no other party is willing to make the same claim. If AB 1510 were bad for survivors, we would be hearing about it, and this would be a different letter. But it isn’t, and still the University has the audacity to claim that it speaks on behalf of the people it has betrayed and mistreated for over 30 years. 
The truth is that AB 1510 would extend the statute of limitations for those who choose to pursue legal action against the University. That is all. If a survivor chooses to pursue the original settlement, this bill would do nothing to affect them. The implication that it would be to their detriment is dishonest and unfair to victims.
AB 1510 isn’t an assault on the rule of law. The statute is only extended for one year in order to provide justice for crimes with consequences that extend far beyond the standard 10-year statute of limitations. What is an assault on the rule of law is a self-interested private institution going against the will of democratically elected lawmakers who aim to correct the errors in current law that would allow for sexual assault victims to be denied legal compensation for crimes committed against them. 
Budgets reflect values, and USC chooses to fund anti-survivor lobbying instead of more resources for survivors, like the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services Center. Actions speak louder than words, and USC chooses to stand as the only opposition to AB 1510 as they send email after email to the student body promising to do and be better. Despite changing leadership, exploitation and abuse remains at the core of this administration. Despite getting a new president, students and community stakeholders remain absent from decision-making processes.
We, the students, should not stand for this. It is incumbent upon us to stand with survivors and to demand justice. Join Trojan Advocates for Political Progress Thursday at 11 a.m. in front of Tommy Trojan to call state representatives to lobby for AB 1510 and to contact members of USC’s administration to sever USC’s paid opposition to it. 
We refuse to be content with decisions USC makes on behalf of students without our involvement or consent. We refuse to trust the empty promises of this administration. We refuse to remain silent. Stand with us.

This weekend marked the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Passover, a holiday that celebrates the Jewish people’s liberation from Egyptian slavery and the beginning of their journey through the desert before receiving the Torah and passing into Holy Land. 
While most Jewish holidays commemorate the historical pattern of, “They tried to kill us. We survived. Let’s eat,” there are certainly some more meaningful implications of Passover. As the academic year comes to a close this week, USC students, too, will soon celebrate our three-month liberation from school. 
This season is also a time to remember what it feels like to be the new kids on the block, the “strangers in a new land,” as the religious text puts it. Judaism teaches us to treat “the stranger who sojourns with you” as “a native from among you” and to “love him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.” 
The values of Passover serve as a guide for modern day inclusion. Over the last few weeks, numerous students from across the country made their way to USC to tour and ultimately make the decision about whether they want to enroll here. Many of them will pay their deposits and accept their spot in the Trojan Family in the coming days, and it is our responsibility to welcome the newcomers to USC. 
Over the eight days of Passover, observant Jews refrain from eating leavened bread. Instead, Jews eat matzah, bread that has not yet risen. While the surface level reasoning for this custom is to remember how our ancestors did not have time to wait for their bread to rise as they fled Egypt, there are several deeper meanings that are applicable today, many millennia later. 
One explanation is that the risen, inflated bread represents the ego, while the matzah represents humbleness. The unleavened bread of Passover teaches us not to inflate our egos and to instead try humbling ourselves for a few days. In that sense, this Passover really is “crunch time,” both because of the matzah, but perhaps even more so because of final exam season. In that spirit, students shouldn’t be afraid to ask for help during the home stretch of the semester and to rely on friends during study days and finals week. 
Because of the Jewish obligation not to eat wheat for eight days, I cleansed my dorm of all wheat snacks last week. Not wanting to waste my leftover baklava, I decided to bring the box to a group meeting. When I offered the treats to someone and explained why I had to get rid of it, she told me she had what she called the “opposite” religious problem: She couldn’t accept the sugary snack because of the Christian Lent fast, which ended on Easter Sunday.  
To that end, both Easter and Passover mark new beginnings represented through food. As a metaphor for college, everyone is off to a new beginning once this week of classes ends. Some students will actually graduate through a “commencement” ceremony, a word whose etymology harkens back to the idea of a “new beginning.” 
So no matter your background or religion, everyone can raise a glass to new beginnings this week.

Two new lawsuits were filed against USC Monday, adding to a growing stack of litigation against two former campus doctors and the University for sexual abuse, negligence and gender violence, among other charges. 
About 15 victims of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall and former campus men’s sexual health doctor Dennis Kelly’s alleged sexual abuse spoke about their experiences with the doctors at a press conference Monday held by D. Miller and Associates, one of the firms that filed the lawsuits. 
Over 650 women are currently involved in lawsuits against the University and Tyndall. In February, USC agreed to a class action settlement that would distribute $215 million to nearly 17,000 of Tyndall’s former patients, but the United States District Court of California delayed a preliminary approval of the settlement, citing unclear distribution procedures. Thirty-three women were named in Monday’s lawsuit against Tyndall and USC. 
At least 30 men — all of whom identify as gay or bisexual — are also suing the University and Kelly over similar complaints, as well as alleged violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, which outlaws discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation at all California businesses. Eleven of those men were named in Monday’s lawsuit. 
Ten of the men and women present Monday spoke about their experiences with Tyndall and Kelly. 
Amanda Davis, a victim of Tyndall’s abuse who spoke at the conference, said she thinks USC wants victims to accept the class action settlement so it can squander the scandal quickly without having to change its policies. 
She said the University needs to make change by creating a reporting system hosted by an unbiased party to track complaints and lead investigations into claims. Davis also said Tyndall and Kelly need to face legal repercussions for their actions. 
“USC needs to be held accountable,” she said. “They need to provide answers for who knew what, when, where. They need to give a voice and closure to victims as they have promised.”
Davis also advocated for AB 1510, a bill that would allow lawyers a one-year period to revive cases — specifically those involving university health centers — that were previously ineligible due to the state statute of limitations. USC has hired a lobbying firm to advocate against the bill, which would allow more victims of Tyndall and Kelly to seek claims. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC said it is aware of the most recent lawsuit against Tyndall.
“The university is aware of the lawsuit,” the statement read. “We will seek a prompt and fair resolution that is respectful of our former students.”
Kelly was employed at the University for nearly 20 years before resigning in August 2018 to work as a men’s health specialist at Cal State Northridge. At the press conference Monday, Andy Rubenstein, one of the lawyers named in the two lawsuits, said  that he also represents two students and victims of Kelly’s who did not attend USC. 
Seth Johnson attended USC from 2017 to 2018. He said Kelly forced him to undergo unnecessary and invasive examinations, along with answer inappropriate questions.
“It saddens me that USC allowed this abuse to continue for years without any change, but I want to turn my sorrow into action,” Johnson said. “I want to encourage and inspire people to speak up and not be afraid to defend themselves from these predatory situations. It’s time for USC and Dr. Kelly to be held accountable.” 
Rubenstein said at the press conference that he expects the University to offer a similar settlement to Kelly’s victims as in the Tyndall case. The University has not released an official statement about the lawsuits since the first was filed against Kelly in February. 
“You go to a doctor … you’re placing your trust in this person,” Rubenstein said. “Everyone [feels] passionate about their school. This is like an intervention for some family member we love but who has gone off the rails.”
