After a two-game losing streak in mid-October, it appears as if USC is back on track.
In consecutive weekends, the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team (18-2, 3-2) has posted a total of three wins, two coming against top-10 ranked opponents, in order to position itself back into the heart of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation title race.
“I think that winning these close matches is toughening us up,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic after the Trojans claimed victories over No. 6 UC Santa Barbara and No. 7 Pacific. “It certainly gives us confidence going into any game, knowing that we can win.”

But a Saturday showdown against crosstown rival No. 3 UCLA will certainly test the notion that the Trojans’ recent performances were all but an aberration.
“They are an experienced team,” Vavic said. “Their best players are seniors. It’s definitely going to be a great challenge for us.”
Whether challenging or not, it remains more than evident that the Trojans have had their fair share of success against the Bruins thus far in 2010.
On Oct. 3, USC notched a 9-8 win over its heated rivals in the finals of the SoCal Tournament following freshman driver Nikola Vavic’s goal with 35 seconds remaining. The victory marked their eighth consecutive tournament championship, sending the Trojans to the top of the polls.
Similarly, USC also defeated the Bruins by a score of 11-10 in the finals of the NorCal Tournament a month earlier. Despite holding an 8-4 lead heading into the fourth quarter, the Trojans surrendered six goals in the final frame, allowing UCLA to knot the score up at 10 apiece, before a goal by junior driver Peter Kurzeka put them on top for good.
“We learned they don’t give up,” Vavic said. “They play tough. In both games, they were down by three or four goals and they came back to tie the game. They’re very competitive.”
But as it’s to be expected in a heated rivalry, where both teams have won five out of the last seven national championships, it might be smart to discount past performances.
“It’s always a little extra special when you play a crosstown rival,” Vavic said. “We always get a little bit more excited about these games. Last year’s championship game was against UCLA too, so it does add a little bit to it.”
But if the Trojans are capable of recording their third win against the Bruins thus far in 2010, it’ll be largely because of sound play on the defensive end.
In the team’s last defeat, an Oct. 16 home loss to then-No. 2 California, the team surrendered a total of 12 goals in a game in which it trailed 8-2 at halftime.
An admittedly frustrated all-MPSF junior goalie Joel Dennerley took responsibility for the loss, but Vavic was quick to note that some of the team’s defensive issues were more of a collective problem.
“I’m not worried about Joel; he always delivers when it counts the most,” Vavic said. “You know, our defense did not help him, and in some of those games we played in and allowed so many goals it was not just Joel but our defense that had trouble.”
Provided the Trojans can continue their improved play as of late, those expected to show up at McDonald’s Swim Stadium could walk away more than pleased in what is expected to once again be a heavily attended contest.
“I hope our crowd is a good one,” Vavic said. “I hope to see a lot of Trojans there. But it’s a big game for UCLA as well. They’ll bring their fans. It’s going to be a great atmosphere.”

Nicolae Ivanescu, a senior majoring in business administration, might just be USC’s Mark Zuckerberg. Ivanescu is co-founder of Just Hear It, a site that could be to music what Flickr is to photo hosting.
Ivanescu’s story begins in 2007. While enjoying Thanksgiving holiday with his roommate, he discovered Pandora, an online streaming radio service. Ivanescu browsed the site and quickly became fascinated by the possibilities of the future of online music.
Photo by Dan Chen, courtesy of Hearit
He began taking notes on what he did not like about Pandora ­— the site’s advertising, for instance ­— and what he thought needed to be improved in a site that could have so much potential. As an entrepreneur, he, along with Cosmin Panait, a friend from Emory University, looked on what Pandora was not doing, what Youtube was kind of doing and what iTunes was successfully doing for a lot of money, and began creating a website that would improve the way people listened to music.
Just Hear It allows for its users to upload any songs they own onto the website. With contributors from across the internet, much like Youtube, Just Hear It is able to stockpile a wide variety of music in its online database.
The more users the site has, the bigger the selection of music they have to follow. One of the best parts of this website — other than its very minimalist, black design — is the incredible capability to personalize the listening process by allowing users to create their own playlists.
With just a couple of mouse clicks, users can create several playlists, which appear on the left side of the screen. With simple drag-and-drop actions, users are easily able to add, delete, shuffle and repeat their favorite songs.
Another innovation is Just Hear It’s capability to search for songs by lyric, as well as artist and song title. Simply typing in “Beatles” yields a listing of all the band’s songs that have been uploaded by users, but type in “where do they all come from,” and “Eleanor Rigby” pops up first on the list.
Users also have a history feature, which allows them to see what music they have heard.
The site has thousands of songs and is rapidly expanding. It already has a large following, with 700 listeners a day. Last year, the site saw an all-time high of 2 million users in a single month — without any publicity. Listeners are the key to the site, providing traffic and the songs that they all listen to.
One of Ivanescu’s mottos is “any song, legal, free,” which is an ambitious plan for his website. When asked about the legality of uploading songs, he said that if the record company does not want a particular song on the site, then they can send Just Hear It a Digital Millenium Copyright Act notice and the site  will remove it.
Unlike Napster, which bypassed the music industry market through its peer-to-peer mp3 site, Ivanescu wants to work with the music industry. In the “about” section of the website, it states that Just Hear It pays for licenses from all the major performing-rights organizations, which then pay publishers and writers in proportion to the number of plays they get, all protected under the DMCA of 1996.
Ivanescu’s plans with regard to the future of the company are to partner with all major labels. At this point, getting in touch with these companies is very difficult; record labels do not pay attention to the website if the rest of the world does not pay attention to the website.
Ivanescu said that the motivation for the site is love — namely the love of music. He wanted to make a music website that is perfected until it is just right for the listener; and he is on his way to carving a name for himself in the online music revolution.

Being the mastermind and moderator of a website might not sound like the coolest job, but it can be if the job is stalking all roaming and upcoming food trucks in the nation’s major cities.
Food trucks have become fast-burgeoning trend in the foodie world ever since the Kogi BBQ truck hit it big by modernizing street food with social networking, and USC alumnus Ross Resnick has made it his business — literally — to keep track of as many of them as possible through his interactive website, Roaming Hunger.
Resnick, who graduated with a degree in international business in 2006, picked Hong Kong as his study abroad destination as a student, and came back well taught — and well fed.
After his semester in Hong Kong, he ate his way through Southeast Asia, spooning up baked pork chop rice in Macau, wolfing down pad thai along the streets of Thailand and chomping on fresh banh mi by the rivers of Vietnam.
Fast food, literally · The Roaming Hunger website follows the now hundreds of food trucks on the road, not just in Los Angeles, but all across the United States, with online guides and reviews of each one. - Photos courtesy of Glen Tagami, Roaming Hunger 
By the time he had completed his culinary tour of Cambodia, the Philippines and China, he was smitten with the delicious, local authentic fare that was street food.
But the love was not reciprocated back in Los Angeles, where street food used to be sparse, the communities spread out and the traffic unfriendly to food carts.
Resnick missed the street food in Southeast Asia so much that he found himself frequently visiting the little taco stand that used to stop by Heritage Hall to relive the warm authenticity of street food. When Resnick was introduced to the Green Truck in 2008, he realized that food trucks might fill the void of street food culture in Los Angeles.
“It’s a gourmet meal at a price less than what you’ll find at a restaurant for the same quality of food,” Resnick said. “It’s convenient, it’s fun, it’s fast and people like to do it as an activity. I don’t see any of these factors deteriorating at any time.”
And he was right.
As more and more food trucks started popping up in each street corner of the city, Resnick struggled to keep up with the growing list of food options — which was when his entrepreneurship senses started tingling.
“I thought that ‘hey, this is probably something other people will want too,’” Resnick said. “It could be something big.”
Calling on fellow USC alumnus Morgan Martin, whom Resnick met during his freshman orientation and holds a degree in computer science, the two Trojans worked together to bring Resnick’s inspiration alive.
Six months later in December 2009, Roaming Hunger was launched.
Since then, Roaming Hunger has parked itself as the go-to hub for all things street food. It is the first nationwide food truck tracker offering real-time truck updates and descriptions on each vendor.
Wherever the food truck trend wanders, Roaming Hunger follows. In big cities such as Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, or smaller areas such as Orange County and Portland, Ore., even north of the border in Vancouver, B.C.; as long as there are people interested in street food, there is work to be done.
With new trucks popping up each day, Roaming Hunger has become a checklist for the vendors. Many vendors now seek out Resnick before they hit the streets, and users are also encouraged to be the website’s eyes and ears. Resnick said that on any given day, about two-to-three new vendors are added to the list nationwide, through notifications by users or the vendors themselves.
Much of the operations on Roaming Hunger are based on user feedback. Roaming Hunger 2.0, launched in August, now alerts a user whenever a truck passes by the vicinity, offers a new truck-booking service for event catering and features a snazzy real-time interactive map with clickable icons to show a truck’s latest tweet.
In a way, Resnick is the ultimate public relations agent for food trucks — one who is actually genuinely passionate and proud about his clients. Each week, he tries to visit at least three vendors — meaning that he has scoured through hundreds of food trucks since he started his business. But even now, Resnick says he is still amazed by how different and unique each vendor is.
“They come in all shapes and sizes and cultures and ages,” he said. “But if there’s one common thread that does unite them, it’s a spirit of entrepreneurship. It is very apparent when you talk to them. This is a group of very hard-working people who produce what they love.”
Resnick not only wants to make food trucks more accessible to the public, he wants to personalize the people behind the trucks as well. The Roaming Hunger blog, for example, is now featuring the “Naanstop Chronicles,” a behind-the-scenes process of starting up an Indian food truck set to launch in early 2011.
Naanstop truck creator Neal Idnani fully reveals the process of starting up a food truck by detailing each snippet of the work, without hiding the freak-outs and frustrations that come with the challenges. Through the series, Resnick gives a human face to these food trucks, and the love that goes behind every bolt of the work.
That can be said for Resnick himself. As a website owner, a majority of his work is spent online, but Resnick says his favorite part of this job is still visiting food trucks, talking to the vendors and eating good food — the all-time favorite street activity that never gets old.

To the average person, the film industry is defined by the actors who dazzle the screens and directors who guide their actions and emotions to complete works of art. But quietly sitting behind the scenes, toiling away for long hours in front of a computer screen are editors, the individuals necessary to turning film into cinematic masterpieces.
Sally Menke was one such editor. She was best known for her work editing director Quentin Tarantino’s films. Menke died last month in Los Angeles’ Griffith Park at age 56.
On Wednesday, the USC Women of Cinematic Arts organized an event praising the contributions of Menke and other women in the field by screening Alan Holzman’s documentary Invisible Art/Visible Artists.
The screening was followed by a discussion panel which included editors Suzy Elmiger, Chris Innis and Yana Gorskaya. Menke and Innis were featured in the documentary for their work on Inglourious Basterds and The Hurt Locker, respectively.
The film offered an insider’s look into the landscapes in which editors work. Featuring nominees for Best Editor in the 2010 Academy Awards, the film showcased a wide range of editing techniques as well, from the technology-dominated system used in Avatar to the documentary style filming of The Hurt Locker.
As the film went on, it was easy to gain a newfound appreciation for the people who stare, cut, paste, translate and analyze clip after clip of footage. The editors referenced the handheld, organic feel of Avatar that makes the audience feel as if they were in the planet Pandora with Jake Scully and Neytiri, the nontraditional Hitchcockian feel of The Hurt Locker which makes it “conventionally dramatic,” and the “gritty look” of Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire that makes the performance honest and free from artifice.
It’s hard for people not involved in editing to realize how significant the process is to filmmaking, and the comments and insights from these veteran editors shined a light on the craft. But merely screening this documentary was not the main goal of Wednesday’s event: It was to spotlight Menke’s work and the importance of women to this field in cinema.
Menke was not originally interested in film — she was interested in psychology because she liked to observe people. She eventually, however, chose to explore this interests through editing.
Educated at New York University and starting her career with CBS documentaries, she became the editor for all of Quentin Tarantino’s movies, beginning with Reservoir Dogs and ending with Inglourious Basterds.
“[Tarantino was] specifically looking for a woman to nurture him through the editing process of Reservoir Dogs,” Elminger said after the screening.
One of the most important aspects to the post-production process, as the panelists noted, is indeed this very relationship between director and editor. Gorskaya said a director should choose someone that he or she could be a roommate with.
And just as directors and actors often have their signature styles in performing work, so do editors.
Elmiger added that Menke had a tangible “commitment and passion” as well as an “attention to behavior and the subtleties on people’s faces.”
Innis said she believed that Menke’s trademark in editing was her conscious decisions to hold back information to increase the suspense and give rhythm to her pieces.
These traits became noticeable during the documentary as it focused on a clip from Inglourious Basterds. It was the scene where Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) orders milk and cream for Shoshanna Dreyfuss (Mélanie Laurent) — hiding under the alias of Emmanuelle Mimieux — to have with her desert. The scene plays with palpable uncertainty.
Does Landa recognize her and is he teasing her with her past as a dairy farmer, or is it simply coincidence? One could see the efforts Menke put into achieving just the right amount of tension — the uneasy twitches on the woman’s face, the smug expression that characterizes Landa.
The general public so easily attributes the success or failure of films and shows to directors, writers and actors, praising “Tarantino’s signature style” or “Brad Pitt’s techniques.” But after viewing the documentary, audiences can become more inclined to give credit where it’s due — to the editors that piece scenes together, and make characters three-dimensional.
It’s hard to imagine the amount of labor that is put into the production of films and television shows, but the next time a criticism or praise is made about visual style and effects, it is important to note the contribution of editors to the very decisions that spark inspiration or initiate disapproval.

Let me tell you something, Toula. The man is the head, but the woman is the neck. And she can turn the head any way she wants,” says Maria Portokalos in My Big Fat Greek Wedding
From Reservoir Dogs to Inglourious Basterds, editor Sally Menke was the metaphorical neck to Quentin Tarantino’s head, one of his best friends and closest collaborators.
Until she passed away in late September, Menke had edited each of Tarantino’s seven feature films, becoming a key determinant of the director’s style in the process. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that her editing acumen in large part made Tarantino’s success possible, for his unique sense of humor, approach to dialogue and character, and penchant for rapid tonal shifts would have been too much for a lesser editor to handle.
What Tarantino needed was an editor who shared his creative vision — and Menke did, a fact both she and Tarantino have acknowledged. Her subtle editing hand helped make Tarantino one of the most culturally significant directors in the last few decades.
So let us now take the time to explore what that means by delving into a few scenes from Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds, the two films for which Menke was nominated for an Oscar.
The first thing you notice when watching a Tarantino film is that his characters almost never shut up. They talk. Prodigiously. And we love them for it. The opening to Reservoir Dogs, every scene between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, the bar scene in Inglourious Basterds — all iconic. But have you ever thought about what makes them possible?
Oh sure, the writing and the performances do, but the thing that stands out is the lack of dead time in these extended sequences. And as anyone who has made a film knows, your writing and your actors can be as good as you like, but you eliminate dead time in the editing room.
Take the first scene between Travolta and Jackson in Pulp Fiction. They’re sitting in their car, driving to a hit, talking about Europe — Amsterdam, specifically. This is the famed “Royale with cheese” sequence. It goes on for about three or four minutes, which is a long time for two people to sit and talk in movie.
The biggest challenge in a scene like this to keep the tension up and keep the audience invested. Sure, the dialogue is funny, and Travolta and Jackson are great, but so is Menke.
Whereas many editors would simply use cross-cuts of the two actors, Menke holds off. Most of the scene unfolds as a basic static two-shot, as Travolta and Jackson talk about Europe. It’s not until about halfway through, when they start talking about the hit, does Menke cut in with the over shots — at the point when the characters are listening, not talking, to each other.
This might seem basic, but what it does is provide structure, not just for the scene, but for the film in general. So when a scene comes along such as the one at restaurant between Travolta and Uma Thurman — a scene of intimacy, taboo and romance — the decision to alternate exclusively between over shots achieves a special significance.
Perhaps more importantly, her editing style keys the audience into what is important. Because of Menke, we’re able to differentiate between the dramatic and the comedic. She makes the dialogue accessible so that the audience isn’t met by a flat wall of words.
Perhaps the best scene Menke ever edited was the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds in which Col. Hans “Jew Hunter” Landa (Christoph Waltz) interrogates a French farmer. The scene is an ingenious blend of everything that defines Menke and Tarantino’s collaboration. It is a scene of suspense, action and — perhaps most disturbingly — humor.
Menke lays down the base of the scene using the fundamental principles outlined above, i.e. alternating between the static two and the overs. This time, however, she adds the close-up to her repertoire.
The subtext to this scene is Landa’s transition from a sheep in wolf’s clothing to — to put it ineloquently — a wolf in wolf’s clothing.
When he is introduced, he is affable, polite, even charming. But it’s a cover. All a swarm of words, just as in the “Royale with cheese” sequence, and Menke appropriately cuts between medium shots — two-shots and overs. But as Landa’s true nature is revealed, as his cunning emerges, we see close-ups for the first time and we feel his power.
Not to go unmentioned, however, is the decision in this scene to not show the Jewish family hiding beneath the floorboards. The standard practice in this scene would be to build suspense by cross-cutting between the Jewish family and the action above. But Menke doesn’t show this. Why?
For one reason: The scene is about Landa. It’s all about him; not about the farmer or the family he’s sheltering. It’s Landa, and Landa doesn’t know where the family is — so neither do we. We only know what he knows — that the Jewish family is there and that the farmer is lying. Nothing more.
What Menke has done is place us, the audience, subjectively in Landa’s state of mind, something that is as genius as it is frightening.
Safe to say, Menke was brilliant, and her death is a loss. These scenes were remarkable, but there are dozens more. She and Tarantino shared a unique bond, something rare between director and editor, and it should be remembered, honored and understood.

Hip-hop and break dancing aren’t usually things that come to mind when people think of helping those hurt by the conflict in Uganda. But in Breaking Cats, they are the tools that help Abramz Tekya, the documentary’s subject, get Ugandan children away from the violence in the country.

The film begins with the introduction of Tekya, the founder of Breakdance Project Uganda, an organization that trains Southern Ugandan children the art of breakdancing.
It follows Tekya through the poorest neighborhoods of South Uganda as he introduces children to B-boying — slang for break dancing —  uniting them with an infectious enthusiasm for hip-hop and dance. He is accompanied by the legendary Rock Steady Crew, including B-boy pioneer Richard “Crazy Legs” Colón,
The film juggles many elements — from Tekya’s background to the conflict in Uganda — but makes them all work. It manages to provide an inspiring personal story: Tekya came from a childhood in the slums of the capital of Kampala and spread his success and passion for the B-boy culture to Ugandan children.
Bouncing Cats also gives viewers a clear understanding of the situation in the war-torn country, explaining the civil war between the government and the Lord’s Resistance Army, a rebel group that abducts Northern Ugandan children and either kills them or turns them into child soldiers.
The dance training Tekya provides is much more than just physical expression. The touching smiles on the faces of every kid working to perfect each move shows how dancing gives them an escape from the real world.
The dancers reflect their resourcefulness when using the words “bouncing cats” to drop a beat when there’s no access to a boombox or drums — it is a fitting origin for the title of the documentary.
Director Nabil Elderkin uses the film well to express the importance of the BPU. Pictures of the ghettos of Kampala and destruction caused by the LRA — shown through gruesome photos of dead bodies and mutilated children — are juxtaposed with bright shots of groups of grinning aspiring B-boys and girls, all while hip-hop streams through the background.
The film follows Tekya as he spreads his break-dance movement  into the more volatile parts of Northern Uganda. The film quickly hooks the audience through anecdotes and personal testimonies, such as that from 15-year old Aghamu Shadia, a girl inspired by the BPU to set up clubs in her own neighborhood. The segment focusing on Alfred Otim, an orphan living with six other people in one home who is  motivated to become a B-boy by Tekya, tugs at the heartstrings of those watching, giving the movie an intimate feel.
As the film goes on, it shows the partnership between the BPU and H.E.A.L.S., a group promoting the importance of play-therapy for war affected children. The audience learns much about the conditions in Uganda from this segment of the documentary, mostly from Claire Lewis, an Oxfam worker who discusses the shortages of food as a result of the humanitarian crisis and inability of Ugandans to farm their land.
Although many scenes in the film are moving, there are a few standouts that make the movie memorable. During the trip to Northern Uganda, Colón breaks down when expressing his desire to help the Ugandans while fearing that they might think he and his team the film are exploiting the film’s footage for profit, without the intention of truly helping the Ugandan people.
One of the last scenes in the film shows Tekya teaching John, a man severely mutilated by the LRA, how to breakdance. This moment is accompanied by K’Naan’s “Waving Flag,” creating an inspiring end to the documentary.
The soundtrack adds emotion and a look into the culture of the country — there is a definite theme of Western influence permeating Uganda, notably found in the track that samples Vampire Weekend beneath traditional Ugandan music.
In addition to capturing genuine moments, Elderkin also fully utilized his connections to the hip-hop world to relay the intent of the music.
Although somewhat disjointed from the focus of the film, appearances by will.i.am, K’naan and Mos Def commenting on hip-hop as a vehicle to bring communities together add true insight into the appeal of B-boying to Ugandans.
Their well-known names add appeal and greater possibility of exposure of the documentary. The gentle, rhythmic narration by rapper Common also adds to the strength of the movie.
Bouncing Cats is a touching documentary on the individual story of Tekya, the country of Uganda and the universality of hip-hop, showing off how much of an impact music can make.

After two wins last weekend, including one against Washington, the team that handed USC its first loss of the season, the USC women’s volleyball team is feeling pretty confident.
However, the No. 7 Women of Troy do not have much time to celebrate their recent victories, as they have to prepare for two very difficult upcoming battles, both on the road.
Staying focused · Junior setter Kendall Bateman and the Women of Troy will face the top of the Pac-10 in Cal and Stanford this weekend. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
USC will face No. 2 California tonight at 7 p.m. before playing No. 3 Stanford on Sunday at 1 p.m. The Cardinal beat USC in the first matchup between the teams earlier in the season, while the Women of Troy handed the California Golden Bears their only loss of the season.
“We’ve got a win over Cal and Cal wants to rectify that,” said USC coach Mick Haley. “They’re going to throw everything at us.”
Despite the fact that USC has already beaten Cal, the Women of Troy are far from overconfident.
“We’ll be on the road at their place — they’ll have the advantages. We’ll see if we can handle the noise,“ Haley said. “Certainly expect a heck of a fight against Cal.”
Although Cal is hoping for revenge against the Women of Troy, USC is hoping to earn some redemption points of its own.
“The last time we played Stanford here, we felt like we should have done better against them,” Haley said. “I think we’ve got something to prove.”
The Pac-10 is full of competition this season, with seven of the teams currently ranked in the top-25. With such a tight race, Haley cannot deny how significant it would be if the Women of Troy went 2-0 this weekend.
“Obviously if you could steal two wins on the road against the second- and third-place teams in the country, we would have a chance to win the conference,” Haley said.
One of the main traits of this year’s team has been its youth, which could sometimes be seen as a disadvantage, especially when every night of competition is intense. USC currently posts six freshmen on its roster, though Haley said his team is not nearly as “youthful” as it was just a few weeks ago.
“I think freshmen are not freshmen too much anymore. They pretty much have settled in,” Haley said. “They’re pretty comfortable, and now they’re starting to compete really well.”
Although there are facets of the game the Women of Troy still need to improve in — passing, blocking and defense in particular — Haley seemed pretty pleased with his team’s performance during practice this past week.
“They were alert. They were physical. Their intensity was good, so I think they’re excited about playing this weekend,” Haley said.
Although the anticipation and hype surrounding this weekend’s matches are high, Haley said he wants to make sure his team remains focused and doesn’t look too far ahead.
“We have to take them one at a time and see what happens, and if we’re fortunate to come out with two wins, then we’ll start talking about playing for the conference championship,” Haley said.

The Pac-10 and the SEC are finally throwing down this weekend. Unfortunately for football fans, the football teams won’t be taking part.
The No. 3 USC Women’s golf team travels to the Stanford Golf Club in Palo Alto, Calif. in the Pac-10/SEC Challenge this weekend for what is essentially a tournament within a tournament.
As in a traditional tournament, the lowest-scoring team will walk away with the team title, but there is also a conference championship up for grabs. The top four scoring teams from the Pac-10 and the top four scoring teams from the SEC will combine to compete for the conference title, with the lower-scoring conference getting bragging rights for the year.
“There seems to be a lot of interest, and they’re trying to do it every year or every other year,” USC coach Andrea Gaston said. “There’s always been a lot of competition between the conferences.”
This is the last fall tournament for the Women of Troy, who have placed in the top three in all three of their fall tournaments. Unfortunately, this will be their first tournament without team leader Lizette Salas. Salas, a junior, will finish her qualifying tournament for the LGPA Futures Tour Friday, where she is tied for 17th going into the final round.
With Salas out, the team will look to junior Lisa McCloskey to provide leadership over a roster that includes a sophomore and two freshmen. McCloskey, a transfer from Pepperdine, has finished fourth place in her three tournaments for the Women of Troy. The two-time All-American looks to maintain her momentum despite being one month since her last tournament. Over that span, she has been in Argentina competing for Colombia in the World Amateur Team Championship. McCloskey paced the Colombian team to 11th while finishing in eighth place individually.
Sophomore Cyna Rodriguez has participated in all three events for the Women of Troy this fall. She has moved up the leader board in every tournament she has played this season, culminating in a tie for 16th at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational a month ago.
Junior Inah Park is coming off the best performance of her career at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational, where her tie for 11th was her collegiate career low.
Freshman Sophia Popov tied for 67th in her USC debut in the first tournament of the season, but bounced back with a tie for fifth at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational. Like McCloskey, Popov spent part of the month between tournaments competing at the World Amateur in Argentina for her home country of Germany. The German team finished in seventh, and Popov led the team with a 16th place finish.
Rounding out the roster this week is freshman Rachel Morris. Morris is looking to improve on her 78th place finish in her last tournament, the Mason Rudolph Championship in September. In her USC debut she tied for 18th at the Fall Preview which took place in early September.
The team has a chance to bring home a trophy for itself and for the Pac-10, which is an entertaining season-ending tournament that breaks the traditional tournament mold. Salas’ absence poses an interesting challenge for the Women of Troy and presents an interesting opportunity for the team.
“We’re going in knowing we have a great amount of talent on this team,” Gaston said. “This is the time to find out what our team is really capable of.”

After a weekend sweep of the Washington schools, the No. 17 Women of Troy (11-4-3, 4-2-1) ride a three-game winning streak into the desert, concluding conference play against Arizona State tonight at 6 p.m. (8-6-3, 2-4-1) and Arizona (5-11-2, 1-6) on Sunday at 10 a.m.
Following their final two games of Pac-10 play, the Women of Troy head back home to await their postseason fate on Monday when the 2010 NCAA bracket is revealed at 1:30 p.m. on ESPNU.
“You want to go into the end of the season with some momentum,” said USC coach Ali Khosroshahin. “Arizona State and Arizona are two tough teams. We have two tough games on the road this weekend and if we take care of business, we’ll be in pretty good shape going into the tournament.”

Even the players recognized the significance of this last road trip, especially because the last two games away from home ended in a tie and a loss to the Oregon schools respectively.
“We’re just trying to focus on playing our game and being together as a unit,” senior defender Karter Haug said. “We just have to play like we did against the Washington [schools] and UCLA.”
As one of three seniors on the team, Haug stepped up her game last weekend against the Washington schools, scoring a game-winning goal and assisting on three goals, all while anchoring a backline that has recorded three consecutive shutouts.
Haug was recognized for her contributions as she was awarded with USC’s first Pac-10 Player of the Week honor and also the first in her career.
“Karter has been the backbone of our backline with all the different changes that have happened there,” Khosroshahin said. “She’s been the one steady presence in the back so it’s nice for her to get recognized for her play.”
With different changes occurring in the rotation, one notable change for the rest of the season will be the absence of redshirt freshman forward Morgan Morrow, who was injured over the weekend.
The coaching staff believes she is likely done for the season, but Khosroshahin said he isn’t too worried, as the play of redshirt junior midfielder Ashli Sandoval has provided a steady presence for the backline.
“You make the adjustments and move forward,” Khosroshahin said. “Sandoval has [been great]. She is very intelligent about the game and she has amazing skills so it’s second nature for her.”
But with all that has happened this year, the Women of Troy still control their own destiny and are in line to qualify for the NCAA Tournament, assuming they close out Pac-10 play on a high note.
“At this point, I’m hoping they know what they need to do,” Khosroshahin said. “This is a test before our ultimate test.”

As the final seconds ticked off on the Coliseum scoreboard’s clock on Saturday, the Trojan faithful who remained in their seats had perhaps just witnessed the end of an era.
Some might argue that USC’s run as the West Coast’s top dog ended well before Oregon’s 53-32 comeback win, but the reality remains the same: Oregon left the Coliseum as the new, undisputed kings of the Pac-10. The Ducks have won 16 of their last 17 Pac-10 games and look like legitimate national championship contenders.
Although the Pac-10 title is now out of reach for USC, all is not lost for the Trojans.
With five contests left on the schedule, including rivalry games with Notre Dame and UCLA, there is plenty to play for throughout the rest of this season.
Trojan fans will surely be treated to some entertaining football during the next month, but please excuse me while I look ahead to next year. It’s never too early for that, right?
Although the Ducks will return with the heart of their spread attack — quarterback Darron Thomas and tailback LaMichael James — the Trojans will have another team to be wary of next year.
When conference commissioner Larry Scott announced the breakdown of the Pac-12’s football divisions two weeks ago, USC learned that it will be competing each year for a spot in the conference title game with UCLA, Arizona, Arizona State and the two new guys, Colorado and Utah.
USC is familiar with the first three. The Buffaloes shouldn’t put any fear into Trojan hearts either, as they are winless in the Big-12 so far this year.
The team with the best chance of beating USC on a year-in, year-out basis for a spot in the Pac-12 championship game currently plays its football in the humble Mountain West Conference.
Ranked No. 5 in the BCS standings, Utah enters its Saturday showdown with No. 3 TCU undefeated and full of confidence.
Even the national media is beginning to notice: ESPN’s College GameDay will be in Salt Lake City this weekend for a game that doesn’t involve a team from one of the nation’s six power conferences.
This season was supposed to be Boise State’s time to shine. If a team from a non-automatic qualifying conference was finally going to play for the nation’s biggest prize, most assumed it would be the Broncos of the blue turf.
Boise State hasn’t disappointed, rolling to a 7-0 record and a No. 4 ranking. TCU has also played well and could very well beat Utah on the road on Saturday.
It’s the original BCS-busters, however, that seems to have the brightest future. Their first breakthrough came on New Year’s Day of 2005, when the Alex Smith-led Utes completed a perfect season with a 35-7 trouncing of Big East champion Pittsburgh.
With the move to the Pac-12, Utah will no longer hear the whispers of “good team, weak schedule.” An undefeated season in the new conference would put them squarely in the national title discussion. The Utes will also be better equipped to tap into the rich talent hotbed of Southern California.
Rivals.com has been ranking college football recruiting classes since 2002. Before 2009, Utah had never cracked the top 50. In 2010, the Utes brought in only the 32nd best class in the nation.
For the team to have such success — Utah has compiled a 77-19 record since 2003 — without the nation’s best high school players, what can we expect from the Utes when they are able to bring in big-time recruits?
Utah has already proven it can hang with top level teams. The Utes’ 31-17 victory against No. 4 Alabama in the 2009 Sugar Bowl completed their second perfect season in five years.
Utah knows it can stack up in the new conference. The Utes have gone 7-3 in their last 10 games against Pac-10 opponents dating back to 2003. Last season, they beat Cal in the Poinsettia Bowl and hung with eventual Pac-10 champions Oregon on the road at fabled Autzen Stadium, losing by seven when their last drive ended with an interception on the Ducks’ 8-yard line.
The Trojans have to make the most of their remaining five games. They’ll need to be ready for what’s looming on the horizon.
Don’t bother getting out the lanterns. There’s no need to signal if it’s by land or sea. The Utes are coming and they’re playing to win.
“Sellin’ the Sizzle” runs every other Friday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Jonathan at jkendric@usc.edu.
Give me a break, Oregon has won how many national championships?  And how many Rose Bowls?  How many consecutive Pac 10 titles.  The Ducks could quack for the next 5 years and they still won’t have the panache of USC. There is only ONE program in the West with a tradition of winning, and it ain’t in Eugene, Palo Alto or Tucson.  They know it and we know it!  Once Kiffin and his daddy get the boot, Troy will be back stronger than ever.  We’ve had down years before and other Pac 10 teams occasionally have up ones, but there is only one dominator THE University of Southern Califoooornia!

Podcast: How do the Trojans respond following their tough loss to the Ducks last week?
Eleven seasons.
It’s been 11 seasons since Arizona State beat USC in a football game — 1999 was the last time it happened.
Searching · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley looks to throw downfield against Oregon last weekend. Barkley and the Trojans, who have dropped three of their last four games and two of their last three in the Coliseum, will face Arizona State on Saturday. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
This Saturday’s game — scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at the Coliseum — is the Sun Devils’ best chance to do so in quite a while, with the Trojans reeling from a 21-point loss to Oregon and ASU coming off a dominating 42-point shutout victory over Washington State.
But USC is still favored, and with good reason: The Trojans (5-3, 2-3) still possess a talented offense capable of putting up the points against almost every opponent, and a defense that struggled against the Ducks but appears motivated to again prove its validity in conference play.
Arizona State (4-4, 2-3) has had a very up-and-down season, consecutively smashing two FCS squads to start the year, then struggling to three straight close losses. The Sun Devils beat Washington on the road handily but lost embarrassingly to Cal — 50-17 — the next week.
A season ago in Arizona, the teams played poorly and struggled to score points of any sort. USC came out on top, 14-9, as USC’s then-freshman quarterback Matt Barkley struggled perhaps more than he had in any game all season.
The saving grace for USC in that game was a pick-six from senior safety Will Harris, the Trojans’ only touchdown. The Arizona State offense appears improved from that game, but Sun Devils coach Dennis Erickson hasn’t noticed much of a change.
“I don’t see a lot of difference from when I watched them on tape a year ago,” Erickson said this week. “They’re one of the better teams in our league and it’s a challenge for us.”
Erickson, 63, has faced USC as the coach of three different squads — Washington State, Oregon State and the Sun Devils. But he’s struggled to consistently top the Trojans at any of those stops, even dating back to the 1980s.
This time, he will attempt to make good use of his talented transfer quarterback — former Michigan signal-caller Steven Threet — and a vicious defense that features Corona, Calif., native Vontaze Burfict, a linebacker who was committed to the Trojans for much of high school career at Corona Centennial but de-committed to head to ASU at the last second in February 2009.
Burfict is joined in the linebacking corps by fellow California native and Centennial graduate Brandon Magee. In all, the Sun Devils have a remarkable 49 players hailing from California on their roster — compared to just 37 from their home state of Arizona.
Other formidable forces on the ASU defense include star freshman defensive end Junior Onyeali and cornerback Omar Bolden, also a California native.
When asked what Arizona State had to offer that he was most worried about, Kiffin said, “I think defense, their pass rush. Really good defensive ends rushing the passer and they’ve given people a lot of problems. This will be a very big test for us.”
Kiffin also mentioned the Sun Devils’ vertical passing attack. Threet has been interception-prone this season, with 13 interceptions compared to 14 touchdowns, but his 63 percent completion rate is solid. A remarkable five ASU receivers have accumulated at least 200 receiving yards on the season — plus running back Deantre Lewis, who also leads the team in rushing with 6.5 yards per carry.
USC’s tackling has improved since the Trojans’ coaching staff reinstated tackling drills in practice two weeks ago. Kiffin said Wednesday that his team’s tackling against Oregon — regardless of the 53 points the Ducks scored — was better than it had been earlier this season.
But the Trojans folded outright in the fourth quarter of that game, letting the never-tired Ducks run right over them in the final 15 minutes and turn a once-close game into a blowout. And with a number of players out of practice or limited this week, depth could again be an issue against the Sun Devils.
It will be a big test.
Listen here! Hear ye ye! I am a duck fan and I can promise you that this game does not matter. Sell your ticket! Sell your diploma, because the only thing that used to make your school worth anything (cheating football team) is no longer worthwhile. They stink! I have done much research, which indicates that the Ducks will win 10 Pac-10/12 championships in a row, whereas, the Trojans will not be better than 4th any year until 2019 when they will cancel the program for being a terrible organization. Poor condom lovers, your day is done. We will however gladly allow USC hacks into UO, but for a price, $75,000 cash, up front, every month. Otherwise enjoy the view of the sea swallowing your sinking ship.
USC < Titanic
Go Ducks! USC licks butts!

USC is generally known for being a school that maintains a commitment to giving back to its surrounding community.
We have a USC Family of Schools that ranges from nearby elementary schools to visual and performing arts magnet schools that provide a quality education to children in the community and foster an environment in which those students expect to attend college.
Our community service programs are active as well, including the Joint Educational Project, which gives students the ability to get hands-on experience in our surrounding neighborhoods, often for credit in an academic course.
However, we can’t stop and pat ourselves on the back just yet. Our community can always benefit from more involvement by USC students and faculty, but both students and the university as a whole will benefit from increased student involvement in the community as well.
The prospect of earning extra credit in a Spanish class by volunteering to work with children at a local elementary school shouldn’t be the only thing driving a student to volunteer. Volunteering is an incredibly rewarding experience, and with all the service opportunities that USC has to offer, it’s easy to do as well.
According to a recent study done by the Corporation for National and Community Service entitled The Health Benefits of Volunteering, “Those who engage in volunteer activities are less likely to suffer from ill health later in life and may be introduced into a positive reinforcing cycle of good health and future volunteering.”
Although this might seem like stretch at first, it’s actually not too difficult to see why it might work. Volunteering simply makes you feel good about yourself and increases your personal satisfaction.
I’ve never met a single student who went out to volunteer in the community and didn’t feel like a better person afterwards, and when you feel better about yourself, you’re more likely to live a healthier life.
Especially when working with grade school students in the surrounding neighborhoods, volunteers usually establish a truly rewarding personal relationship with those that they’re working with.
JEP recently just paired up with USC’s Neighborhood Academic Initiative — a program that prepares local low-income students for admission into USC — in order to provide student mentors for local high school students to help them in writing and college preparedness.
The success of this new program shows exactly why volunteering can be such a personally rewarding experience for college students.
“The Writing-Mentoring Program has been a great opportunity for students to connect with community students and connect to books,” Alice Villasenor, JEP’s director of Public Humanities Initiatives, recently told the Daily Trojan. “It really is a two-way street, which is the essence of service learning.”
In addition to the relationships these volunteers develop with local students, they also enjoy the immense satisfaction of knowing that they’re helping a student prepare for admission into USC — a student who otherwise might not have ever thought such a goal was remotely possible.
Volunteers can also learn the importance of time management. As college students, we’re all probably busier than we’ve ever been before in our lives. And when we’re not spending our time writing a paper or working at an internship, we’re most likely out enjoying ourselves as college students should.
However, taking even a couple of hours a week out of our busy schedules will reap rewards far beyond the amount of time we put into volunteering itself. With more extracurricular activities such as volunteering, you’re forced to manage your time more efficiently in order to get everything done while still leaving some free time to head to a party with some friends.
In fact, in a report entitled College Students Helping America by the Corporation for National and Community Service, it was found that students who worked part-time were more likely to volunteer than students who didn’t work at all.
On top of all the personal benefits enjoyed by volunteers, community service also helps to brighten USC’s reputation as well. USC has been committed to being an important factor in the community, especially with so many low-income residents in the surrounding neighborhoods.
Community service by Trojans helps to improve our reputation in the eyes of our neighbors, especially to those who might simply view us as overprivileged trust fund babies who come live in the middle of their hometown for four years at a time.
In short, volunteering benefits everyone. Go out and show your Trojan spirit by giving back to your community — not only will those who you help appreciate your effort, but you will be improving yourself and the university as well.

Election season is over, but a circus of any kind always leaves some confetti in its wake. Regardless of the fact that there are no more votes to cast, comments about big oil, marijuana and Meg Whitman’s infamous housemaid are still speeding through campus.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Many people find this talk annoying. We’ve made the decisions, after all. Can’t we walk down Trousdale Parkway in peace?
But if those who have already voted are exasperated, consider the feelings of the people who didn’t vote. Many students are as apathetic as ever, but a lot of non-voters are likely experiencing some guilt.
On top of the professors who urge us to vote, there’s always that one friend who won’t shut up about politics. And, well, there was that one time the president practically begged us to vote right in front of Doheny Library. That was kind of a big deal.
Non-voters of USC, have no fear: This column isn’t going to give you any more grief.
In an ideal world, all members of a democracy would be public policy experts, swatting aside propaganda and casting educated votes. Unfortunately, that’s not the world we live in. The midterms we’re familiar with come with blue books. We have jobs and extracurriculars; many of us probably can’t remember the last time we cooked a decent meal (or did laundry, for that matter).
Now, none of this presents a challenge to the politically inclined. If you love elections, following the candidates is fun. It’s just like any interest. Cinema students have homework like everyone else, but they still make it to premieres, right?
The thing is, if politics isn’t your thing, it’s homework — plain and simple. People don’t like to do homework. For some of us, the following happens: either we don’t do it or we end up turning out a less-than-exhaustive effort.
Voting works the same way. A lot of people who weren’t that interested in the first place get told to vote right and left so they eventually give in, only to find that no amount of pamphlets will compel them to care about mortgage laws. Some people even mark in random bubbles — “Hey, at least I voted, right?”
Not exactly. Voting is a privilege, and it comes with additional obligations. If you commit yourself to voting, you commit yourself to looking beyond commercials and doing your own research. You commit yourself to gaining at least a basic command of the issues.
If you happen to be among those people who don’t care — and can’t force themselves to care — don’t vote. Just don’t. Don’t feel guilty, don’t make excuses and don’t succumb to pressure, well-meaning as it might be. Perhaps you’re not being the most responsible citizen out there, but no one is perfect. Democracy means having the right to not vote, too.
Before someone starts throwing metaphorical tomatoes at me, I would like to emphasize that I’m not discouraging people from voting. It’s an incredible opportunity to be part of something bigger than yourself. However, it’s also one that must not be taken lightly. If you’re going to commit, go for it. Your state — and your country — need you.
But if you’re going to choose whichever name sounds cooler? By all means, carry on studying for your own midterms. There’s something honest and responsible about admitting that you haven’t done enough research to understand the issues. A misinformed vote is worse than no vote at all.
Just remember that you’re forfeiting the best right in the United States: the right to complain.
Maya Itah is a junior majoring in communication and international relations. Her column,  “Wait, Think Again,” runs every other Friday.
Joe, I think the article makes a great point, one which I have personally been stressing for awhile now. I’d much rather people not place a vote than make an uneducated vote. As the article says, if they dont know, and dont care, then they dont need to be anywhere near a polling place. leave the political decisions to those who actually care enough about the state/country to do their research before voting.
Well, she has a point, Joe, since most of them who didn’t vote would have voted for the Democrats had they gotten off their butts.
That’s a good point.
Right. Sure. Don’t let the fact that you just acquired another three trillion dollars of debt, which your parents happily signed you up to pay back, motivate you to get your butt to the voting booth! After all, how could it possibly affect you?

New Provost Elizabeth Garrett has introduced the Provost’s Postdoctoral Program in the Humanities, her first major step toward achieving her goals as provost of the university.
Garrett, who was appointed provost and senior vice president of academic affairs last week, has said one of her main initiatives is to strengthen the Ph.D. programs at USC.
“I talked about … creating some very top, excellent Ph.D. programs. We have even more that are really at the cusp of becoming the truly greatest Ph.D. school in the country,” Garrett said.
The new program is the first of its kind at USC, created to strengthen the participating students as well as the university in general, said Vice Provost for Graduate Programs Sarah Pratt.
The award will be offered to current Ph.D. holders who wish to further their studies in the area of humanities. The program will provide mentoring and train scholars to become teachers at academic institutions, and  participating scholars will be involved in full-time research and teach three courses to establish an independent portfolio.
“Scholars will have a few years to improve their dissertation to book manuscripts that will be more likely to be published after the program,” Pratt said. “In return, they’re helping to improve the humanities at our institution.”
USC will begin accepting applications for the program this year, with the goal of starting the postdoctoral initiative in August 2011.
Selection will be competitive, as the program will support up to 10 scholars who are chosen primarily on merit and their potential to contribute to further research of the humanities each year. Scholars selected each year will spend two years in an academic discipline in the humanities category, but may receive a job and leave after the first year.
The program will be fully funded by the provost’s office, and scholars will receive a salary of $50,000 per year, with an additional $6,000 for travel.
Pratt said she believes the program will be both an advantage for the university and the students involved, as the postdoctoral scholars will receive additional support in becoming a part of tenure-track faculty.
“This new program will not only improve USC’s contribution to the humanities as an institution, but it will also strengthen the qualities those with a Ph.D. need to receive a position as faculty in today’s society,” Pratt said. “It benefits both our scholars and us as a university.”
The scholars will receive the support of academics, organizations and programs dedicated to the humanities at USC. Signature USC programs will come together to support the program, including the Visions and Voices initiative, provost Ph.D. fellowships and research grants.
Scholars from universities worldwide will come together to work with USC’s faculty, graduates, undergraduates and fellow postdoctoral scholars, something Pratt said would benefit all parties involved.
“It will be interesting to see our improvement in the humanities with fresh ideas from the contributing scholars,” Pratt said. ”We hope the scholars’ time on campus will help them prepare for their future.”

A food lover who has worked with chefs such as Wolfgang Puck and Lee Heftner, Eric Ernest joined USC Hospitality as the new executive chef who will be responsible for overseeing the progress of the department’s 39 venues.
“I love food. There isn’t a food I don’t love,” Ernest said.
But maybe more importantly for students is Ernest’s next statement.
“There isn’t a food I can’t make great,” he said.
Hail to the chef · New executive chef Eric Ernest said he wants to provide students with homey, comfort food and artisanal products. -  Photo courtesy of Wagstaff Worldwide, Inc. 
Ernest, who has traveled to more than 25 countries including Budapest, Morocco, Honduras and Belize, said his trips have helped him to discover food that he is truly passionate about,
“I’ve always had an affinity for multicultural food with high-quality produce that is time sensitive, temperature sensitive and technique driven,” Ernest said.
Ernest, who has more than 10 years of experience in the field of managing large, multi-unit dining experiences, served as the executive chef of the hospitality conglomerate SBE.
He described his method of dealing with USC’s extensive dining operation as blocking and tackling. He said he plans to identify all of the problems and group them into smaller projects.
“You can’t boil the ocean,” said Ernest, who also said he plans to focus on simple issues such as requiring all staff to be present in uniform and emphasizing impeccable sanitation.
Having been officially named to the position in mid-October, Ernest has had four weeks to assess the wants and needs of the USC student body. He said he’s been able to get an idea of what students want with the meals.
“USC students want a blend of traditional, homey comfort food and artisanal products, and it has to be blended in a way to give them variety and something different everyday,” Ernest said.
Ernest said he already envisions improvements to the dining experience on campus, including upgrading cooking techniques, training staff, buying better produce and even introducing a grab-and-go line of organic snacks.
“I see students eating candy bars and think, ‘Why can’t we make that candy bar with quality products and in a smaller portion?’ It would fit our students’ budgets and prevent them from eating a whole candy bar,” Ernest said.
Regarding the concern of organic food being significantly more expensive, Ernest said he plans to counter the issue by buying in bulk and cutting down portion size.
Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, said he looks forward to seeing what Ernest brings to the table.
“We at USC Hospitality are looking to redefine what higher campus and residential dining consists of,” Klinger said. “Chef Ernest’s experience, knowledge and expertise will help us bring it to the next level.”
Ernest, who has traveled to more than 25 countries including BUDAPEST, Morocco, Honduras and Belize…

The third annual Greek Gala will celebrate President C.L. Max Nikias and his first year in office tonight at Town and Gown.
More than 300 USC Greeks, alumni, administration and staff will come together for the black-tie optional affair that will welcome Nikias, Panhellenic Council President Laura Redfern said.
“It’s such a historic time for USC and we just really want to welcome him in and start to facilitate a great relationship between the Greek community and the new administration,” Redfern said.
Beth Saul, assistant dean for Student Affairs and Director for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development, said she believes the gala will help cultivate an important relationship between the USC Greek community and the new administration.
“The Greeks have had a longstanding partnership with the university senior administration and we want to get our partnership with Dr. Nikias and his administration off to a positive start,” Saul said.
Since the gala is typically an event catered to Greek members, a 10-minute video will be shown during the evening that emphasizes different aspects of Greek life such as philanthropy, scholarship and athletics.
“We really want to show Dr. Nikias just how capable the Greek community is and to show the administration that we really are grateful for his vision for USC,” Redfern said.
Redfern said she believes that the gala is the perfect occasion to demonstrate the strengths of the Greek community despite the negative attention Greek life received earlier in the semester.
“This is a chance for us to really show the university and the administration that we are a very sophisticated and responsible group of people who really love our school,” Redfern said. “We really are capable of great things even though we didn’t display our best behavior at the beginning of the semester.”
Last semester’s Greek Gala, hosted in April, raised $20,000 for the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Although this year’s event is not a fundraiser, guests can choose to donate money to the newly established Greek Life Endowment, a fund that was created in order to reserve money for Greek activities that were normally considered outside of the budget, Redfern said.
Redfern said the guests are in for an “extremely special surprise” following Nikias’ speech.
“The Greek Gala is a tremendous way to punctuate a great Greek Week, and an awesome opportunity for the Greek community as a whole to welcome President Nikias with one united voice,” said Jake Magerman, president of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.
So when are they tapping the kegs?

In response to a report aired last week by a local news channel, USC officials have denied that there is a bed bug problem in campus housing.
The report, broadcast by KTLA, accused USC of having bed bugs in student housing and not educating students enough about the issue.
Several students were interviewed and described their personal issues with bed bugs.
In the story, Michelle Huynh, a junior majoring in gerontology, said the bugs “get hungry every night and I am their feast.”
USC Media Relations released a statement in response, pointing out what it said were several inconsistencies in the news report and saying that none of the interviewed students are currently living in university housing.
“The university has no documented reports from them during that time of a bed bug issue,” the statement said about students who were interviewed in the report.
The response also mentioned that USC “publicly provide[s] information to students on integrated pest management and on bed bugs specifically.”
This information is available on the USC Housing website, which states “USC Housing doesn’t have a pest problem.”
Keenan Cheung, the director of USC Housing, denied that bed bugs are a significant problem in campus housing.
“We have only had 11 incidences in the past 12 months,” Cheung said.
Bedbugs are nocturnal animals that feed on human blood and can cause rashes. Outbreaks of bed bugs have been reported at schools throughout the country in recent months, such as at the University of North Texas.
Dr. Lawrence Neinstein, executive director of the University Park Health Center, said the campus is not seeing cases of bed bugs and that though the pests are an inconvenience, they don’t spread disease.
“Bed bugs are not fun, but they don’t seem to communicate serious diseases,” Neinstein said.
Cheung said USC Housing takes measures to prevent bed bugs on campus.
“USC Housing conducts a triannual inspection utilizing specially trained certified canines to check all of our apartments and residence halls [and] thoroughly clean all our facilities over summer break,” Cheung said.
If bed bugs are discovered, USC employs licensed pest management companies to eradicate the insects.
Huynh, who does not live in campus housing, told the Daily Trojan that she wants the university to be more proactive in helping students living off-campus deal with bed bugs.
“I would love the university to present the students with cheaper packages for bed bug control because the treatments get really costly,” Huynh said. “They should really back the students up when we’re dealing with private [landlords].  We’re always being taken advantage of.”
When contacted, USC Media Relations said the university had nothing more to say on the issue.
Wow really very good news to hear about bed-bugs……….This bed bugs creates many problems to all……..
Officials say USC is bed-bug free…..GREAT NEWS……I really want this to happen…………amazing think……..
Thanks for this information……

When Marvel Studios announced The Avengers, all seemed well. It would bring together all of its heroes into one all-out summer blockbuster. That meant that Chris Evans’ Captain America, Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworth’s Thor would be sharing the big screen together, alongside Samuel L. Jackson’s super-spy Nick Fury.
Add in geek-favorite and talented director Joss Whedon (Serenity) and it seemed like things were set for the film to go off without a hitch.
However, BleedingCool.com is reporting that the studio is having issues with the film’s budget. Apparently, Marvel wants to produce the film for only $160 million, roughly equivalent to the costs of the first Spider-man movie. The announcement has apparently delayed production of the film by weeks.
This is not the first time Marvel’s tried to cut costs. It tried to keep Iron Man 2 to a low budget, initially offering Mickey Rourke only $250,000 for his role as Ivan Vanko. For a while, both Rourke and Jackson had issues with the prices before finally making new deals with the studio.
It’s unlikely that Marvel’s budget goals will be met — a film like The Avengers is going to take a lot of money to make. The only question will be how long until the studio realizes that and loosens the purse strings.

The men’s basketball team had a strong showing in an Oct. 23 scrimmage against Air Force, leaving USC coach Kevin O’Neill impressed with the team’s play — particularly from freshman point guard Maurice Jones, who is expected to start at the position until transfer junior Jio Fontan is eligible to play.
Jones played 38 minutes in the scrimmage, racking up 10 points and 10 assists and leading the Trojans to an unofficial victory of 75-46 over the Birds. Junior forward Nikola Vucevic also made his presence felt during the game, with 20 points and 13 rebounds. Vucevic is expected to be a key contributor of this Trojans team. Freshman guard Bryce Jones out of nearby Taft High picked up eight rebounds in 21 minutes of play.
O’Neill was also pleased with the team’s stamina and conditioning, saying that “as the game wore on, we got stronger.” The defense also did its part, holding Air Force’s “Princeton” offense to 46 points. The team prepared through film study and ensured that they would not give up the easy backdoor layups that the Princeton offense is reliant on.
Freshmen forwards Curtis Washington and Garrett Jackson did not participate in the scrimmage because of a strained groin and broken nose, respectively. Fontan and transfer forward Aaron Fuller also did not participate because they are not eligible under NCAA transfer guidelines.

California’s proposed $43 billion high-speed rail system may get its start in the Central Valley after the federal government declared that it wants all $3 billion of its initial funding for the project to go toward one segment between either Fresno and Merced or Fresno and Bakersfield.
Many thought that the first segment to be built would be from Los Angeles to Anaheim because the engineering on that section had progressed further.
However, officials want to get the federal funding into the economy quickly, create jobs rapidly and have an operational piece of the system going as soon as possible.
The Central Valley segment would provide this opportunity by quicker construction in less congested areas.
Eventually, the system should link from San Francisco and Sacramento down through San Diego.

Four days after losing to top-ranked Oregon, the USC football team seems ready to move on.
Players and coaches alike offered the same response to a seemingly endless string of questions about the team’s 53-32 loss to the Ducks.
“We have to push forward and [make] sure we have the same focus we had last week preparing for this game,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “[Arizona State] can play as well as anybody on defense when they want.”
Take down · Junior defensive end Armond Armstead and his teammates are eager to face Arizona State, which has allowed 2.38 sacks per game. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Despite its 4-4 record, Arizona State boasts a fast and nasty defense spearheaded by star linebacker Vontaze Burfict. The Sun Devils, who forced Oregon to punt 11 times in their game, came closer to stopping the No. 1 team than anyone else.
“They have a good defense,” senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson said. “With us, we just have to execute our plays and do what’s asked of us.”
The USC coaching staff expects fast play from the team on Saturday. USC kept up last week’s tempo at practice Wednesday, racing subs in from the sideline and getting the ball out to receivers quickly. Kiffin said the Sun Devils’ pass rush is a major concern entering the game.
“They have really good defensive ends rushing the passer and they are giving people problems,” he said.
For their part, the USC defensive linemen believe pass-happy Arizona State gives them an opportunity to make big steps.
“It’s definitely something every defensive lineman dreams of, having the quarterback sit back and pass all day,” redshirt sophomore defensive end Wes Horton said. “We’re changing our mindset from last week when we were on our heels to getting our hands in the dirt and going after the [quarterback].”
Any concerns that the Trojans would suffer a letdown following a big loss seem minimal. Horton said the team’s sole focus is on stopping Arizona State and picking up a win.
“It’s not really fun to be 5-3 right now,” assistant head coach Monte Kiffin said. “But 6-3 is a lot better than 5-4, so we have to be ready to play.”
—
For a team loaded with future NFL receivers, the catch of the day came courtesy of sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley. Near the end of practice, Barkley snared a pass along the right sideline with one hand.
“He has great hands,” Johnson said. “I think all quarterbacks do [because] they play with the ball a lot. If you get them out [there], something good is going to happen.”
—
A number of Trojans were limited during practice Wednesday, including redshirt sophomore defensive end Nick Perry, redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo, sophomore linebacker Devon Kennard and junior offensive tackle Tyron Smith.
Junior tight end Blake Ayles, freshman cornerback Nickell Robey and redshirt senior tailback Allen Bradford did not play. After practice, Kiffin said Bradford was dealing with a minor personal issue.
FIGHT ON!! BEAT THE SUN DEVILS!!!

After winning the ITA Southwest Regional Championships last weekend, four USC players are in Flushing, N.Y., today to start  play in the USTA/ITA National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships. Two other USC players will compete at Duals in the Desert, an annual tournament in Palm Springs, Calif.
Serving it up · After winning the regional title, senior Maria Sanchez and three of her teammates are heading to New York to play in the USTA/ITA National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships this weekend. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
Sophomore Danielle Lao, the singles regional champion, senior Maria Sanchez, the regional runner-up and No. 3 seed in the country, and junior Alison Ramos and sophomore Valeria Pulido, doubles champions, will represent USC in New York.
With only the top 32 singles players and top 16 doubles teams in the nation competing, it is no small feat that USC has four players in the competition. Those who participate in the tournament are champions from USTA/ITA Regional Championships nationwide, the USTA/ITA National Small College “Super Bowl” champions, the doubles champions and singles quarterfinalists from the Riviera/ITA Women’s All-American Championships, in addition to at-large and wild card selections made by the ITA National Tournament Committee.
For USC players participating in the tournament, the stakes are high. This is the last tournament the team will compete in until January.
“This is a single elimination tournament so [our] goal is to be a front runner. … A good start will give us a huge advantage,” Ramos said. “We are flying across the country with the goal of winning the tournament and nothing less.”
With their hearts set on winning, the Women of Troy will face many obstacles on their way to the top.
“It’s indoors, and we don’t get a chance to play indoors, and there’s the time zone change disadvantage,” coach Richard Gallien said. “The trick in these things is to stay alive long enough to get your sea legs.”
Duals in the Desert also starts today, with freshman Kaitlyn Christian  and senior Cristala Andrews playing for USC. Senior Lyndsay Kinstler would have also participated, but she had to back out because of pneumonia.
“There’s gonna be a lot of good competition, so it’ll be a good chance to get some matches in,” Christian said. “We’re just all really excited to play in preparation for our season.”
USC will face UCLA and University of Georgia players in this tournament. The Women of Troy would have also battled Northwestern and University of Texas, but those two schools will not be participating because of financial reasons.
The ITA Indoor Championships and the Duals in the Desert will wrap up on Friday, and the women’s tennis team has high hopes for the last individual tournaments it will participate in until early next year.
“It’s our last opportunity to compete for a long time so my hope, win or lose, is that we do it with a great deal of class and integrity, and, god-willing, the kids will knock off a few matches here or there and carry that onto January,” Gallien said.

While six of his teammates are playing on the other side of Los Angeles, junior Steve Johnson will showcase his skills across the country during the ITA/USTA National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships.
Play starts today at the USTA-Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing, N.Y. — site of the US Open.
Locked in · Even though he is the defending champion, junior Steve Johnson qualified for nationals as a wildcard and earned the No. 7 seed. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
Johnson is the defending champion of the event, which has existed since 1978 and consists of a singles field of 32 of the best players in college tennis. Johnson will enter play today as the No. 7 seed after obtaining one of the two ITA Wildcard selections.
The tournament will take place at the new indoor facilities on site, but Johnson has some familiarity with the setting.
“I played at the US Open Qualifiers, so it’s a familiar place,” Johnson said. “Hopefully that helps me out this year.”
Even though Johnson has played at one of the iconic venues in all of tennis before, USC coach Peter Smith said it’s a special opportunity for collegians to play at Flushing Meadows.
Johnson will begin play against Georgia junior Wil Spencer, who is coming into the tournament with a seven-match winning streak.
Spencer spent his first two seasons at Texas A&M before transferring to Georgia.
At a tournament with so many quality players, Johnson said he does not pay much attention to any potential matchups later on in the tournament.
“I’ll have to go with the flow,” Johnson said. “You have to beat five really good players. I’ll take it one match at a time. Just like any other tournament, I have to be prepared and focused.”
As the individual season winds down, the Trojans have some positive results to take with them into the dual match season, but there is always room for improvement.
“It’s been going really well,” Johnson said of the team’s play so far. “The guys have done really well at Napa, NorCal [the Battle at the Bay] and at Regionals.”
Freshman Ray Sarmiento made his presence known by winning the singles portion at the Battle at the Bay and the doubles championship with sophomore JT Sundling.
Johnson defeated five top-40 players on his way to the consolation title at the ITA/D’Novo All-American Championships earlier this month.
Junior Daniel Nguyen made the final round and freshman Michael Grant won the consolation draw at the ITA Southwest Regionals.

It’s halftime at a USC football game at the Coliseum, and some students are heading up the aisle to get some snacks.
They stop when a fire erupts.
Looking back toward the field, they see flames tossed high into the sky, standing out against the backdrop of the night. The Olympic torch that rests at the top of the Coliseum is not lit yet, so the flames must have another source. The spinning flames reach the arc of their flight and start to fall.
Underneath the flames, Emily Clapper impatiently waits. She seems oblivious to the flame dancing just dozens of feet above her head and falling fast. She does a few graceful twists and looks up just in time to catch the baton with a ball of fire at either end. She smiles to the 80,000 people watching as she twists the baton in her hands a few times and tosses it back up in the air.
Clapper, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, is a baton twirler in the Trojan Marching Band. Although most kids who go to a USC football game in the Coliseum idolize the football players and Song Girls, Clapper had her eyes elsewhere.
Ever since she was little, she dreamt of hearing her name announced at the Coliseum as a USC twirler by legendary announcer Dennis Packer. She set a goal in second grade to turn her dream into a reality, which is something we all can learn from.
Too many times, kids dream about becoming a firefighter, astronaut or ball player, and though sometimes people’s interests change, most of the time society decides that making those dreams a reality is impossible and discourages it. Although twirling won’t be Clapper’s profession, she nevertheless sought out her passion and pursued what she loved — even though she had no idea where it might take her.
“It was a goal. I never knew it was actually going to happen,” Clapper said. “That’s what I wanted to do and I was going to do everything I can to make it happen and twirl at USC.”
Clapper’s dad, a USC alumnus, has been taking her to Trojan football games for as long as she can remember, where she was immediately attracted to the twirlers.
“They were highly visible,” she said. “I thought they were beautiful and really cool and their names were announced.”
Clapper started twirling in second grade at St. Theresa Catholic School in Palm Springs, Calif. She joined an after-school program and performed at malls, in parades and during assemblies. Three years later, she got her first big break when Lynn Mallotto, a former twirling national champion who had a son one year older than Clapper, partnered up with Clapper’s after-school coach. Mallotto is still Clapper’s coach to this day.
As more kids dropped out of twirling in middle school and high school to pursue sports or music, Clapper stuck with it. By her sophomore year in high school, she was the only student left that Mallotto took under her wing. Even though Clapper found success at nationals in the summer between high school and college, her goal hadn’t changed.
“I didn’t want to be the best twirler in the world or whatever; I just wanted to twirl at USC,” Clapper said. “So that was my goal in my twirling life and I knew that twirling at USC meant that I had to have the grades and everything to get into USC before I could even be a twirler here. Everything I did in high school was to prepare for my career at USC.”
When it came time to choose what college she would attend, Clapper picked USC before twirling tryouts.
However, twirling tryouts came in April of her senior year of high school. She only had one other person to compete against, but there was a twist that she wasn’t prepared for. She had to try out in front of the entire marching band.
Twirlers try out at the same time as the drum majors, the person who dresses up as Tommy Trojan, and because the band votes on the new drum major, they also vote on the new twirler. But many band members don’t know much about the intricacies of twirling.
“Oh my gosh, it was so scary,” Clapper said. “The band is literally there judging you and deciding if you’re going to fit in with the band and if they’re going to like you. So all the band really knows is if you look the part and you don’t drop [the baton].“
Fortunately, band director Arthur C. Bartner has the final say of who gets the twirling gig, and Clapper found out it was her that night. She hasn’t looked back and she’s been twirling at USC football and basketball games ever since. Clapper has also performed at two Rose Bowls and the many exotic places the band travels to, including Hawaii and Brazil.
“It’s seriously the experience of a lifetime,” Clapper said. “I felt like it was so special for me.”
Clapper, who can twirl as many as three batons at a time, says USC will be the final stop of her twirling career. She starts her master’s program in public health in the spring and doesn’t want to compete individually because she feels burned out after exhaustively competing in high school.
But for the rest of her life, she won’t forget the experience of twirling at the Coliseum and hearing her name announced over the speakers of the Coliseum. Announcer Packer approached Clapper at the Stanford game a few weeks ago and complimented her on her fire-twirling abilities.
For Clapper, that perfected her dream that came true.
