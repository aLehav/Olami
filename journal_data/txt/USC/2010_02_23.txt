The No. 5 USC women’s golf team struggled through two days of wind, rain and 40-degree temperatures on its way to a 12th place finish at the Wildcat Invitational at the Arizona National Golf Club in Tucson, Ariz.
The Women of Troy finished at 50-over-par 618 (308-310), 42 strokes behind No. 3 Arizona State. The finish is their second worst of the year, after the 16th place finish at the UNCW Fall Preview in October.
For that tournament, the Women of Troy were missing No. 1 golfer sophomore Jennifer Song and lost senior Belen Mozo in the final round to injury. This week, the team had its lineup at full strength but struggled in conditions so poor the tournament was forced to cancel the second round of play.
The break in action and the poor conditions wreaked havoc on scores across the board, as Arizona State’s winning combined score was an 8-over-par 576. Second place and host team Arizona recorded two rounds of 10-over-par to finish 12 strokes back of the Sun Devils at its own event.
Not even the No. 2 team in the nation, the Auburn Tigers, could handle the conditions, finishing a combined 37-over-par.
Mozo finished as the team’s low scorer for the week at eight-over-par 150 (77-73). Mozo, seeking her team-record fourth All-American award this year, balanced her four bogeys with two birdies to have the lowest round of the tournament for any of the Women of Troy. Mozo finished tied for 22nd, 16 places up from her finish in the first round.
Song had her worst finish of the season with a tie for 40th at 12-over-par 154 (74-80). Her final round, which was marred by three double bogeys, is the first time Song has not scored below 80 in her USC career.
Junior Lizette Salas, seeking a third All-American award this season, finished tied for 53rd at 15-over-par 157 (79-78). Two birdies in the final round were not enough to overcome five bogeys and two double bogeys. Salas shot three over par on the last three holes in the final round.
Senior Caroline Kim (79-79) and sophomore Inah Park (78-80) tied for 57th at 16-over-par 158. Kim finished her final round with three double bogeys, three bogeys and a birdie, while Park had two double bogeys, five bogeys and a birdie.  Freshman Cyna Rodriguez entered as an individual and tied for 86th at 25-over-par 167 (84-83).
The Women of Troy have six days to regroup before competing at the Bruin-Wave Invitational at the Robinson Ranch Golf Club in Canyon Country, Calif., from March 1-3.

Returning home, the No. 5 USC men’s tennis team (10-1, 0-0) played as close to perfection as realistically possible in its 7-0 sweep of San Diego State (1-6, 0-0).
In recent matches, the Trojans have been in search of consistency throughout the lineup, and yesterday they gave a consistent effort by not dropping a single set throughout the match.
“I’ve said that we will keep working toward being perfect, and today we played closer to perfect,” USC coach Peter Smith said.
Against the Aztecs — who had recently won two out of three doubles matches against No. 6 UCLA — the USC doubles lineup gained some confidence.
Senior Robert Farah and freshman J.T. Sundling started the day off with an 8-4 victory, coming off a tough doubles loss against Pepperdine last Friday.
Juniors Jaak Poldma and Peter Lucassen continued to show off their winning ways in pulling away from juniors Andre Feliz and Tim Schulz van Endert during their 8-6 victory.
Soon after, sophomores Steve Johnson and Daniel Nguyen defeated their counterparts 8-5 to seal the doubles whitewash.
USC used a new singles lineup as Lucassen took Johnson’s No. 2 spot in the order, and Sundling returned to the singles lineup after sitting out the singles portion against Pepperdine.
Johnson took the opportunity to rest his back before the start of play against Pac-10 opponents this upcoming weekend.
“I don’t think it will be an issue,” Johnson said of his nagging back stiffness. “I felt this was a good time to take the day off before Pac-10 play starts.”
Lucassen was bumped up in the lineup to test him out against some tougher competition, Smith explained.
Lucassen was indeed tested, as his match against senior Juan Gomez was the last to finish because of a lengthy second-set tiebreaker. Lucassen took the lead in the tiebreaker but was eventually forced to fight off set point multiple times. He eventually grabbed the last set for the Trojans, 6-2, 7-6 (14-12).
At the No. 1 position, Farah seemingly had the match sealed with a 5-2 lead in the second set. His opponent fought back to force a tiebreak but fell short as Farah won 6-1, 7-6 (7-5).
Poldma was the first to finish his singles match, winning 6-2, 6-4 over Feliz.
Next, sophomore Matt Kecki extended his singles winning streak to six consecutive matches by defeating Giovanni Vaglietti 6-4, 6-2.
Nguyen bounced back after losing his singles match at Pepperdine during his straight-set triumph over sohpomore Luis Rattenhuber 6-2, 6-4.
In another promising performance, Sundling controlled his No. 6 match with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Schulz van Endert.
The importance of this home match could not be overstated as the Pac-10 season starts this weekend with two matches against No. 15 California and No. 14 Stanford and many of the players are busy with schoolwork that takes up much of their time.
“It is tough to play and study, as many of the players are in the middle of midterms,” Smith said.
With a lot on the players’ plates at this point and the team heading into a crucial juncture of the season, the sweep of the Aztecs is a big aid to the entire team’s confidence.
“Right now we are playing well, we just have to keep things rolling,” Johnson said.
As the team heads up to the Bay Area this weekend, it feels that its recent performance has built a solid foundation in the hopes of compiling victories against conference foes.
“This win creates momentum, and momentum is huge heading into Pac-10 play,” Smith said.

Oh, the times they are a changing.
At this time three weeks ago, a match between the No. 6 USC men’s volleyball team (8-5, 6-4) and the No. 5 Cal State Northridge Matadors (11-4, 8-4) looked like a clash of Mountain Pacific Sports Federation titans — two teams posed to make a run at an NCAA title.
But in an age of sports where nothing remains sedentary and the mantra “you’re only as good as the last game you played” reigns supreme in locker rooms all over the country, it should be no surprise that these two conference rivals are not the same teams they were when they opposed one another in a five-set thriller earlier this month — a win that the Matadors escaped with, despite blowing a two-set lead.
When the top team in the land pays a visit to the Galen Center to take on the Trojans tonight, throw out all ideas of rivalries, plans of revenge and title previews. The only thing that matters in this battle of the walking wounded is a victory.
The Trojans come into their final home match of the month in desperate need of a calendar change. The February portion of their season has managed to shake their confidence, diminish their chemistry and drop them five spots in the polls.
The team that once looked like a shoe-in for an MPSF regular season title has recently lost its step on a path that looked headed for a potential spot in the NCAA final. However, the Trojans have dropped four of their past six matches and nine of their past 12 sets, while also failing to outhit their opponent ssince the start of the month. Not to mention, they haven’t won the crucial first set in nearly three weeks.
While it is easy to get negative during hard times, the Trojans have found a sense of optimism amid their recent despair — a quality that will go a long way in shaping how their season turns out.
“We realize it is a long season and we still have a lot of room for improvement,” sophomore middle blocker Steven Shandrick said. “We know what we need to work on in practice before facing Northridge to get better.”
Although the team’s lofty goals have run amuck lately, the challenge of improving against tougher competition will undoubtedly be present when the Trojans meet the Matadors  tonight.
While CSUN has dropped three of their previous five matches ­— most notably a five-set upset at the hands of the UCLA Bruins last Friday — the Matadors’ No. 5 ranking is more than indicative of their veteran leadership and unflappable young talent.
Led by senior opposite hitter Theo Edwards (leads team in kills, total attacks and serve percentage) and sophomore setter Matt Stork (leads team in assists and set percentage), CSUN looks every bit the part of a championship-caliber team as it embarks on its fourth stop on a five-match road trip.
Though it seems the Trojans will have their hands full when the whistle blows at 7 p.m., the team is looking for a fresh start as both the second half of the season and the month of March approach.
“Of course there were a few games that we wished had gone our way the first half of the season,” sophomore libero Andrew Pizula said. “The best thing we can do is learn from those matches and work to play our best volleyball in April and May when it matters most.”

Jennifer Song dreams of playing in the Masters Tournament.
She insists it was just one of those extravagant dreams she had as a kid and, with some of the biggest names in women’s golf being turned away from Augusta National, it seems almost impossible today. 
But what’s surprising isn’t the fact that Song might just have the ability to make this a reality; it’s the fact that she has any time to dream at all.
It’s 5:30 in the morning. Nothing is moving outside and, other than the yellow-jacket security staff, there are few signs of life around campus.
This is the time that Song’s alarm rings. She’s up before the birds, the sun and her classmates. The USC sophomore has to be at the course at 6:45 a.m., so she gives herself time to eat and gets in her car.
Golf has constantly been a driving force in Song’s life. It needs to be if she wants to get up most days at an hour many college students don’t even know exists. Don’t worry, she gets to sleep in on Tuesdays and Thursdays — until 8 a.m.
Such is the life of a soon-to-be professional golfer. After enjoying unparalleled success last year — when she became the second woman in history to win the U.S. Women’s Amateur and the U.S. Women’s Amateur Public Links Championships in the same year — Song decided she would turn pro at the conclusion of this season.
It’s a decision that had been in the making since her elementary school days in Ann Arbor, Mich. She would tag along with her dad to a driving range in a golfing dome. Often bored, restless and curious, she picked up the clubs and figured out how to swing them.
Her dad was so impressed with her swing that while she was in third grade, he entered her in two local golf tournaments “as a joke,” as Song puts it. Song would not only win both of those tournaments but did so with power and precision, winning the longest drive and closest to the pin competitions as well.
Those are two of her tools she refines every morning at the course. But after spending all morning on the links, Song has to hurry back to campus for class from noon-6 p.m. She’s constantly moving from golfer to student. It’s tiring, but she gets through it with the same disciplined and focused demeanor she displays on the fairway.
Rarely does she even have time to smile. Rules officials have noticed. When accepting the trophy for her win at the US Women’s Amateur, the officials finally caught a glimpse of that grin.
“One rules official came up to me and said it was great to see me smile because they said I had a poker face out there,” Song said. “They saw no facial expressions from me out on the course.”
Song was so focused on winning, she forgot about everything else around her. She’s been winning ever since those tournaments in Michigan. After moving to Korea in fourth grade, Song played everything, from basketball to soccer to volleyball, and beat all her challengers. In middle school, she was recruited to play on the high school varsity basketball squad, but her headmaster wouldn’t allow it.
These challengers weren’t limited to girls either.
“I beat all the other guys in middle school,” Song said. “My brother didn’t like playing sports with me because I was better than him when I was growing up and he didn’t want to lose to a girl.”
Perhaps this is where the Masters dream was born.
But Song’s passion laid in the middle of the fairway. She played golf straight through high school and during her first two years at USC. She’s played a round with Cristie Kerr, and Lorena Ochoa actually asked Song if she could eat lunch with her. For those of you keeping score, that’s a total of eight LPGA major top 10’s in the last two years at one table.
That number could soon be 11. Because of her success, Song has been invited to play in the Kraft Nabisco Championship, the first LPGA major, in April.
Although she’s “really psyched” to play with the best players in the world, there’s another aspect of the tournament that speaks to the fact that Song is still a teenager at heart.
“I hear they have a lot of crackers and junk food there,” Song said. “I’m still a little kid because I get excited for those kinds of things.”
There are very few moments in Song’s day that allow her to be a kid. Those come at about 10:30 p.m., after class, working out, showering, tutoring and dinner — usually with her teammate and roommate Inah Park at a local Korean place. Before sitting down to study, she finally gets to be a normal college student and procrastinate by playing Solitaire, checking Facebook or satisfying her addiction to movies. Finally, at 1:30 a.m., Song gets to go to sleep. She’ll be up again in four hours, hustling through the day. She’ll barely have time to dream, but she has so much time to turn those dreams into realities.

Growing up, Jacki Gemelos always seemed to have a basketball in her hands.
At the age of 7, Gemelos decided she wanted to play in the WNBA. She poured her heart and soul into basketball and developed into a transcendent player. Gemelos averaged nearly 40 points per game her senior year of high school and did it with uncommon skill and panache.
Another chance · Injuries and hardship behind her, redshirt junior guard Jacki Gemelos has made an immediate impact on the Women of Troy, averaging 10.6 points and five rebounds per contest in five games since returning from knee surgery. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
Gemelos wasn’t just better than everyone she played against. She looked better playing. Lightning-quick crossovers led to soaring layups. No-look passes found her teammates with laser precision. Gemelos could knock down a deep 3-pointer on one possession and elevate over an overmatched opponent on the next.
Numerous scouting agencies and magazines declared her the National High School Player of the Year. A decorated college career and WNBA stardom seemed to be in the cards.
Unfortunately, her knees wouldn’t cooperate.
Gemelos tore her right anterior cruciate ligament for the first time in a high school playoff game. She was dribbling down the court late in the first quarter when an opponent pushed her from behind. Gemelos stuck out her leg to keep from falling and felt it hyperextend.
“I kind of hopped around on my other leg until I realized it really hurt and fell [to the floor],” Gemelos said. “I started crying because I knew that something had happened.”
She was sitting in her living room with her dad and Amateur Athletic Union coach when the phone call came saying she had torn the ligament. Gemelos broke down again at the prospect of missing a year of basketball.
“It was definitely a very, very hard time,” she said. “The thought entered my mind that I would have to redshirt my first year at USC, and that made it even harder for me.”
The next three years would push Gemelos to the limits of her mental strength and determination. She went under the knife four times to repair her knees.
“She’s very strong-minded,” said Linda Gemelos, her mother. “I think most of all it’s the love of the game. She’s had that since she was eight years old.”
There were times when Gemelos wanted to throw in the towel. Times when the prospect of another year of rehabilitation seemed too much, and she wondered why it had to be her.
“I asked that question a million times,” she said. “After my second surgery I talked to one of my friends, and she said, ‘The last thing you need to start doing is questioning, “Why me, why me?” ’ ”
Gemelos took the advice to heart and stopped pitying herself. Instead, she focused her energy on rehabilitating her knee. Even after injuring it two more times, Gemelos kept fighting.
“I believe everything happens for a reason, and I know that in the end, somehow there’s a silver lining to all of this,” Gemelos said. “Not everybody has a passion for something. I think that I’m fortunate and lucky to have found my passion at such a young age.”
Even the most optimistic person would have a hard time finding the positive side of her saga. One time Gemelos’ body rejected the ligament graft doctors put in her knee. The ligament disintegrated and wiped 6 months of rehab away with it.
However, there was reason for hope: a new coach who doubled as a lucky charm.
“I told her that one thing I was blessed with is I bring good karma with me,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “I told her to get ready because this was going to come sooner rather than later.”
Gemelos and Cooper formed a bond during the lonely hours the pair spent shooting inside the Galen Center. Gemelos put up thousands of shots, with Cooper rebounding each one of them.
“In the beginning, when I was limited, all we would do was shoot,” Gemelos said. “He rebounded for me every day. I felt he believed in me right off the bat regardless of how many surgeries I’d been through.”
The faith Cooper showed in Gemelos paid off when she made her long-awaited debut for USC at California. It was a homecoming of sorts for Gemelos, who grew up an hour away in Stockton, Calif. Friends and family at the arena saw her score eight points and hand out five assists that night.
Her parents were in the stands again last week when Gemelos drained a deep 3-pointer that put the Women of Troy ahead for good against Washington.
“It was so heartbreaking when she was hurt — every time she got hurt — and we couldn’t fix it,” Linda Gemelos said. “Now to see her play, it’s just the best feeling in the world.”
Her return so far has been spotted with moments of inconsistency. Sometimes Gemelos is a step slow laterally on defense. Other times she gets the ball stolen in traffic. Her coaches aren’t worried. After three years off, a little rust is par for the course.
“I think right now she’s trying to find her skill level and find out what she can and can’t do with the brace on,” Cooper said. “At 60 percent, she’s better than a lot of players that are 80 or 90 [percent].”
For every turnover she commits, Gemelos makes five plays that remind you why so many people called her a once-in-a-decade prospect in high school. Talent oozes out of her. Gemelos is a gifted and willing passer, a deadly outside shooter and good for at least one “did you see that” moment a game.
Everything might not turn out the way it should for Gemelos. She might injure one of her knees again or decide she’s sacrificed enough for the game and hang up the sneakers.
“I think the reason I continue to play and fight through the surgeries is so I can reach my goal of the WNBA,” Gemelos said. “I feel like, however many years it takes me, that is realistic because I know that’s what I want to do.”
Gemelos deserves to put her knee problems behind her and enjoy the rest of her college career. She deserves to hear her name called at the WNBA draft. But none of that really matters.
Just being back on the court is victory enough.
“I knew every single time that I hurt myself somehow I was going to get through it because I love basketball so much,” Gemelos said.
Here’s betting she makes it.

In Disneyland’s Magic Eye Theater, it’s out with the incompetent inventor Dr. Wayne Szalinski and in with intergalactic hero Captain EO. With the final screening of Honey, I Shrunk the Audience on Jan. 3, the way was cleared for the triumphant return of 1986-sensory-overload spectacle Captain EO. For those who don’t remember, the Coppola-directed, 17-minute, 3-D adventure stars Michael Jackson as the titular Captain EO and Anjelica Huston as the Witch Queen, presider over a macabre world overrun with all the requisite set pieces that indicate a post-apocalyptic hellhole in cinema. The experience is enhanced with smoke / laser effects and a field of stars projected inside the theater walls.
The first showing of EO was at 10 a.m. Tuesday morning. Crowds composed of the unique breed of hybrid mourner-fans (their habit of descending in absurd numbers on sites relevant in the singers life began on Jun. 26, the very day of Jackson’s death) converged en mass in front of Disneyland Monday night, vying to be seated in the first screening of the “4-D” feature. Enormous lines were implemented specifically for those wishing to be among the first to experience the re-release of the 1986 short film.
Jackson’s death last summer gave a much needed boost to the largely online-based effort to bring Captain EO back to the Tomorrowland theater. Park officials haven’t publicly designated an end-date for Captain EO‘s run, so it looks like the film will be screened indefinitely, or at least until its popularity flags — an unlikely scenario in the foreseeable future, given the massive wave of posthumous love for the King of Pop.

The scruffy Fyfe Dangerfield is best known in England as the multitasking singer-songwriter-instrumentalist frontman of British avant-garde pop band Guillemots. But even after two full-length albums and three EPs, his Mercury-Prize nominated group is still obscure listening in the United States.

The band is known for its orchestral approach to pop music and songs that often pair clasical instruments such as strings and horns with ambient layers of musical saws, typewriter noises and theremins. Although credit for Guillemots’ masterpieces is split between its four members, Dangerfield — who was writing choral arrangements for a local ensemble when he was just 20 years old — is the Gorilla Glue that holds it all together. His ear for aural detail saves Guillemots from being just another commercial British indie band, and his versatility as both a vocalist and musical leader is one that makes a solo album necessary and inevitable.
While touring in 2008 to promote Guillemots’ heavily electronic-influenced Red, Dangerfield went back to basics, independently penning a group of mellow tracks reminiscent of the band’s earliest material. Armed with this cache of subdued acoustic songs, Dangerfield grabbed longtime producer Adam Noble and headed into the same small studio where Guillemots put down its first EP in 2005.
Recorded in a meager five days, Fly Yellow Moon is a rollercoaster of emotions — from elated love to drunken rejection — all told through poetic verses and illuminating musical harmonies. With several tracks mixed on a 1960s-era mixing desk and the rest left in their original state from the initial recording session, the album throws back to the days before Auto-Tune and Pro Tools and showcases Dangerfield as a true music artist.
Although Dangerfield set out to record a batch of stripped-down love songs, the unpredictable musician couldn’t curb his love of musical layers and ended up with an album that seems to embody that struggle.
The first track on Fly Yellow Moon comes in right where Guillemots’ last album left off — with a synthesized beat. But after two counts-of-eight, the song explodes out of its synthetic shell — and, symbolically, Guillemots’ — to reveal the 29-year-old’s least-processed music to date.
Through an energetic piano riff — recorded as a demo on his grandmother’s antique upright and kept intact on the final track — bouncy plucked guitar harmonies and a chorus about uncontrollable sexual urges, “When You Walk Into The Room” tosses out the sometimes cryptic messages of Dangerfield’s main project and lets go in a way that Guillemots’ made-up love songs never could.
Lyrics such as I can’t help it if I’m happy / I can’t help it if I’m happy not to be sad are sung urgently and from the heart. And coupled with the infectious piano-guitar interplay, the song is physically affecting, passing Dangerfield’s teenage-like first-love giddiness onto listeners.
The only other upbeat track on the album, “She Needs Me,” is also emotive enough to make a love-Scrooge smile. With epic string arrangements, no doubt from Guillemots member Aristazabel Hawkes, swirling around a climatic chorus where Dangerfield proclaims This is where I want to be, the song could easily serve as the life-affirming soundtrack for the awkward male lead in an indie romantic comedy (think of the song playing in Punch Drunk Love when Adam Sandler is running through the airport). The song aurally and lyrically encompasses the liberating naïveté of falling in love in such an appealing way that even cynics might have a hard time resisting its feel-good urges.
But the majority of Fly Yellow Moon stays clear of Guillemots’ pop sensibilities, opting for mellow piano and acoustic guitar-based songs that force Dangerfield’s impressive vocal range to the forefront.
On “So Brand New,” for example, his voice starts off in a Nick Cave baritone, but, by the chorus, it’s swooping through the upper rifts of Mariah Carey’s soprano. The guitar is not jumpy and plucke, as in the opening song, but is instead controlled acoustic strumming, and Dangerfield’s voice provides the right amount of sonic complexity to level out the relatively smooth music.
Daring songwriting and dramatic pipes weave the album through tracks reminiscent of everything from Irish music-film Once (“Barricades”) to Belle and Sebastian’s playful intimacy (“Livewire”), but the demo tape for Dangerfield’s solo versatility doesn’t capture the full potential of the compositions.
While it is nice to experience the front man away from the complex arrangements of his band, the simple songs cry out to be filled in by obscure atmospheric noises and layers of horns and strings.
Though Fly Yellow Moon is not an album of Guillemots songs, knowing what the four-piece is capable of creates an urge to hear what the more skeletal tracks would sound like after being fleshed out by Dangerfield’s band’s international influences. It’s comparable to appreciating what Duke Ellington creates alone at his piano but at the same time knowing how much better the notes would sound if played by his orchestra at the Roseland Ballroom.
While not an earth-shattering solo debut, Fly Yellow Moon displays Guillemots’ heart at its most honest and raw. The album is Dangerfield’s musical bedroom, the place where he feels most comfortable to play his heart out, and it begs the question whether or not he will go back there again. As the final song brings in another symbolic synthetic beat, Dangerfield warns This can go in any direction / Any direction at all.

When American figure skater Johnny Weir glides onto the ice, people discuss more than his triple axel.
Yes, it’s not easy to ignore his outlandish costumes and rocky relationship with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals because of his very public love of fur. But larger and louder than both of those is the endless, media-driven dialogue on Weir’s sexuality.
Weir, a three-time U.S. National Champion, has been the most compelling, electrifying and controversial athlete competing at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics — and mostly by default. NBC provided minimal on-air coverage of Weir leading up to the men’s figure skating events last week, excluding him from the heartfelt, tell-all segments the channel produced for fellow skaters Evan Lysacek and Jeremy Abbott. The NBC commentators, too, were restrained when speaking of Weir prior and during the events, treating the skilled skater as a peripheral member of the Olympic community.
Yet that didn’t stop Weir from making the pre-competition news more frequently than gold medalist Lysacek, whether it was about his beautiful-yet-underscored free skate, bedazzled corset or his unapologetic flamboyance and the continual taunts he receives for it.
This self-defined “pop star on ice” is a rare breed of performer in today’s world, even among those currently heralded as musical pop stars. Certainly numerous female musicians bare as much chest as Weir, but very few males swing the sexuality pendulum as much as he does.
Weir’s glitzy, unabashed bravado is not only akin to his idol and kindred spirit Lady Gaga but also many of rock’s top-tier performers from the days where drag queens in the East Village weren’t the only men parading around in shimmering paint.
In the early ’70s, a subgenre of rock music developed in the United Kingdom as a backlash to the scruffy hippie movement. Lead by the extravagant David Bowie, the appropriately titled glam rock was quickly characterized by stylized performances, outrageous outfits and gender-defying makeup.
This audacious trend that danced on the fringes of homosexuality inspired numerous American rock musicians, some of whom were already waist-deep in misogyny-dominated American rock ‘n’ roll.
Before a show in the early ’70s, The Stooges’ frontman Iggy Pop decided to shave off his eyebrows, slather Johnson’s Baby Oil onto his face and give himself a glitter beauty treatment. He performed splits and pelvic thrusts while topless and sported crotch-highlighting pants that have become his trademark.
But alas, something changed in the 1980s, and the aforementioned sexually open-minded musicians retracted their previous, homosexual-leaning statements.
As conservatism took hold and the first traces of the AIDS epidemic emerged, it became clear the tide had changed. Although hypersexual female musicians flourished toward the latter end of the decade, many male musicians became entrapped in rock’s alpha-male machismo.
Although it was once deemed OK for male rock stars to perform outrageous theatrics on stage, most played it cool: strumming guitars in plain T-shirts with deadpan faces. And while Bowie and Iggy were once looked at as visionaries, their larger-than-music, glitter-veiled performances are now seen as kitsch.
Perhaps it was the growing fear that Bowie’s theatrical (Ziggy Stardust) alter-ego was merely novelty over substance that convinced him to return a part of himself to the closet, lessen the eye makeup and marry a woman. And while Iggy still performs shirtless (but with a tad less glitter), a question mark still hovers over his sexual orientation.
Likewise, Weir is discreet when asked about his sexuality.
“There are some things I keep sacred,” Weir told the New York Times in 2008. “My middle name, who I sleep with and what kind of hand moisturizer I use.”
But despite his attempted secrecy, Weir’s blatant underscoring, apparent to even those with an untrained figure skating eye, further reinforces the notion that a heterosexual image is not only prized but a trait one must possess in order to be taken seriously in the public sphere.
Weir might not become the most decorated figure skater in history, but his exhilarating programs will continue to garner standing ovations and crowns of roses.
As he told reporters after arguably his best free skate last Thursday, “I have all my role models out there … judging by the audience reaction at the beginning of my program and at the end they go on my journeys with me.”
Glam or no glam, it’s clear wherever Johnny Weir goes, lights, cameras and his fans will follow.

Tear open a Nabisco 100-calorie pack, and you get five little crisps that resemble the conveyor belt castoffs of Oreos or Chips Ahoy. Nabisco’s new slogan is “Diet Like a Diva,” and it bears some truth. Chances are you will feel so dissatisfied with these Oreo wafers that you’ll storm off to find a pack of the real thing. To add insult to injury, these shrimpy baggies have no nutritional benefit or anything filling enough to quiet the tummy rumblings.
But at the same time, the concept of the 100-calorie pack enforces portion control, and it’s no secret we are a nation of mindless munchers. For those who count Oreo consumption by the sleeve, consider this alternative: VitaTops, a product created by the New York-based company Vitalicious. For 100 calories, you get fiber, whole grains and the ultimate solution to the midnight sweet tooth.
Just like the muffin-top centric Seinfeld episode, VitaTops are the best part of the muffin packaged independently of its lower counterpart. They come in over a dozen flavors, from traditional BlueBran to sweet and savory Golden Corn and decadent Double Chocolate Dream.
Each VitaTop is only 100 calories but, unlike the Oreo crisps, offer something more than a quick sugar jolt. VitaTops are made with whole grains and have four to seven grams of slow-digesting fiber, which means they will stave off the munchies.
But the whole grains factor is the real winner here. Many foods that are advertised as “healthier alternatives” — such as a number of Newman’s Own products — still use enriched flour, which is devoid of nutritional value. Whole grains are heart-healthy and have fiber, which is good for digestion and keeps you full.
VitaTops are also low in fat and free of trans fat or cholesterol. Additionally, VitaTops are fortified with vitamins and minerals such as B vitamins, zinc and iron. Granted, vitamins are better absorbed from whole foods, but it’s still better than a bag of Fritos.
Instead of Nabisco’s 100-calorie yogurt-covered Nibbles, which taste nothing like real yogurt-doused pretzels, VitaTops are real muffin tops, albeit ones made with decent ingredients. No cardboard diet-food taste and no watered-down cakey hybrid — just an improvement upon Elaine from Seinfeld’s million-dollar business idea.
Because VitaTops are made without preservatives, they are mailed in ice. VitaTops must stay in the freezer or be consumed within five days. That leaves three dining options — microwaved, toasted or frozen. Actually, they taste good all three ways, though the traditional muffin flavors like CranBran and AppleBerry benefit from heat and toasting gives them a nice crunchy exterior. The chocolate flavors are great frozen.
After trying every flavor, I could not pick a favorite. The Golden Corn VitaTop tastes fantastic with chili or butter. The traditional bran and fruit ones go well with jam, nut butter or cream cheese — or marmite, if you happen to be British. The chocolate flavors, which include Banana Fudge and Chocolate Mint, taste great any way you like your chocolate. My favorite variation was a chocolate VitaTop slathered in peanut butter.
There are many opportune moments to eat a VitaTop. They work as part of breakfast, as a snack and especially as a dessert. I like to crumble one over a bowl of Greek yogurt. Add in some nuts and berries, and it’s a party in a bowl. At just 100 calories, VitaTops are small, but Vitalicious makes them satisfactory for taste, not just some silly notion of “guilt free.”
If your interest is piqued, there are two ways to get your muffin top on. VitaTops are sold in stores, though in limited distribution. Alternatively, you can order them online. The website has frequent sales and membership specials, so there are many ways to get them for less.
In addition to VitaTops, Vitalicious also makes 100 calorie VitaBrownies, which are a great way to satisfy a brownie craving, as well as VitaMuffins (twice as big as a VitaTop) or Vita cake mix. The website even has customer-submitted recipes.
VitaTops are a great fix when you want something sweet but don’t want the whole cake or know you would not be able to stop at one slice. Unless you attack the box, your sweet treat ends at 100 calories and a shot of fiber — not too bad for a muffin top.
According to Nabisco, dieting like a diva means settling for unsatisfying little crispies — just another example of why diets are goofy. Skip the diet and try a Fudgy Peanut Butter VitaTop. You will feel much more like a smug little diva.

Five black actors stood together on a small, emotionally-charged stage, moments away from telling a story very few people know in full. The actors — four surrounding one — suddenly broke into a chant describing the heart-breaking story of Emmett Till. The one in the middle, contorted and twisted, slowly rose from the ground as if being born into his own tale, that of a 14-year-old black boy whose murder helped spark the civil rights movement. And then — almost imperceptibly — the songlike chant slowly transformed to speech, organically transitions into traditional dialogue.

The grace with which the words flowed, the incredible changes that came over the characters and the ingenuity of the play’s musical aspects had the audience wondering if Ifa Bayeza, the playwright of The Ballad of Emmett Till, was more a magician than a writer.
After glowing reviews and prominent awards for the play’s debut production at Chicago’s Goodman Theater, Bayeza decided to bring The Ballad of Emmett Till to a more intimate setting. The writer found that setting in the Fountain Theatre and decided to give Los Angeles the honor of hosting the play’s West Coast premiere.
“Los Angeles presents the opportunity to bring the play to a broader national conversation. I wanted to really test its potency as a major American story,” Bayeza explained.
But after Emmett Till’s remains were tragically vandalized in a Chicago cemetery last summer, Bayeza started to rethink the story she was telling.
“I felt the story was not yet resolved because here was another affront to his legacy,” Bayeza said. “I wanted to re-envision the story down to the sparse and a more desperate and lonely level because the cemetery tragedy brought a whole experience of grief back into my consciousness.”
She cut the cast down to five, and the actors played every role. The actor who played Emmett’s black cousin also played his white killer. The same actress who played Emmett’s great-aunt also played his grandmother. The only one with a single role was Emmett himself.
Director Shirley Finney, who specializes in experimental and conceptual theater, suggested that the spiritual oneness that comes from a cast of five creates more freedom than it does challenges.
“Emotions don’t see color, we transcend the spirit of who we are as human beings,” Finney said. “If you can keep up spiritually and understand connectedness, we could connect as a human race.”
But most impressive was the ease with which the transformations happened. The accents, though changing, were flawlessly consistent. Karen White, who at one point played a black boy with captivating charm, would disappear behind a desk and reappear as a mature white woman with an impeccable southern belle attitude.
But characters were not the only things that transformed. The entire play flowed from dialogue to song, to dance, to dream, to flashback, to reality. Nothing stopped moving for the entire two hours, just as Emmett Till — a self-proclaimed “lover of language” — never stopped talking.
“He walked with a limp and spoke with a stammer, but he never let the disability stop him, which you glean from this piece,” Finney said. “For the first 50 minutes you simply fall in love with this man.”
But Bayeza and Finney did not just tell the story of Till’s brief life. Their work embodies the spirit of the boy with the rhythm of speech and the musicality of language.
Bayeza captures this essence in what she calls the “dance of language.”
“We had the actors physicalize the language with their bodies, which makes it a powerfully magical and spiritual experience, one that feels very current,” Bayeza said.
The music seems to “physicalize” just as well in a scene where the performers beat bamboo drumsticks. The percussive performance ignited rhythm, beats and ritual in an intimate scene between Emmett and his uncle.
“The bamboo sticks are more about keeping with the global urban aesthetic, rhythmic, spiritual and emotional appeal,” Finney said, referencing the hip-hop, jazz, crump and a cappella influence in the play. “This is so immediate and organic. There is electric energy. It is an interdisciplinary theatrical experience.”

USC freshman quarterback Matt Barkley returned to the practice field last week, throwing passes to his receivers for the first time since minor surgery and readying for spring practices.
Barkley went under the knife at the end of January to fix minor damage to his right throwing wrist sustained during the 2009 season. At the time, Barkley expected to be healed for the start of spring practice, and his return to Howard Jones Field means the Trojan quarterback is right on schedule.
Steve Clarkson, Barkley’s personal quarterback’s coach, told ESPN at the time of the original surgery that Barkley injured his wrist during the Ohio State game – played in September – but continued the rest of the season without treatment.
Barkley finished his debut season with 2,735 yards passing and 15 touchdowns while leading the Trojans to a 9-4 record. USC’s season culminated in a Emerald Bowl victory over Boston College, the Trojans first non-BCS bowl since the end of the 2001 season.
Barkley and the Trojans will start their spring practice schedule March 30, which gives Barkley ample time to work off any rust that he may have acquired during his recovery period.

Throughout history, generals and other world leaders have tried their best to keep their battle plans a secret, allowing only the highest ranking leaders to know the relevant information. Many believe the element of surprise is key to winning battles. Many leaders claim giving the enemy advanced warning of an invasion would be military suicide.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization doesn’t seem to think so.
Prior to its recent invasion of the Taliban filled region of Marja in Southern Afghanistan, NATO had widely publicized its invasion plans for the past couple of weeks to both the international media and local Afghan leaders.
Many were quick to criticize NATO for this, claiming that advanced warning of a military assault would give the Taliban time to prepare for battle. Plus, such a strategy was previously implemented on a much smaller scale to mediocre results.
However, NATO had a different effect in mind.
Routinely criticized by human rights organizations as well as some world leaders for the civilian deaths in combat operations, NATO decided to take a different approach to save innocent lives. By advertising the invasion weeks before it actually happened, NATO leaders felt Afghan families living in the region would take notice and leave the area. Refugee camps were set up outside of the battle area and were prepared to take the onslaught of residents living in Marja. NATO also thought perhaps the earlier advertising of the invasion would convince insurgents to leave the area.
NATO is hoping its new attempt in Marja to actively save civilian lives will help reduce criticism from various organizations that have been critical of NATO’s collateral damage in Afghanistan. Groups, including several at USC, have protested against the killing of civilians, in general, during war. Organizations such as Food Not Bombs have condemned the West’s military actions and its support of military actions around the world that have resulted in the deaths of innocent people.
Many human rights groups have staged protests against NATO across the world, including university campuses. By trying out this new strategy in Marja, NATO is trying to fix its poor image when it comes to human rights.
Reaction to the advertising campaign has been mixed. Thousands of Afghans living in Marja did manage to make it to the refugee camp, but many others were prevented from leaving because of Taliban threats and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) on main roads.
According to The Economist, Stanley McChrystal, the American and NATO commander in Afghanistan, said Marja would be an important test for this new counter-insurgent strategy. Furthermore, he claimed the security NATO will provide to the residents as well as basic governance will be very important in winning the trust of the locals. McChrystal emphasized that the people of Marja will receive the benefits of “better government, economic opportunities and of living under the rule of law.”
Along with the capture of noted Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in Karachi, Pakistan and the increased aggression of NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the tide seems to be turning against the Taliban, at least for the time being. It is vital to keep the pressure on the Taliban, however, and not let up.
NATO’s new focus on actively trying to prevent civilian casualties along with an increased aggressiveness against Taliban-infested regions seems to have saved innocent lives. A pause in the offensive might give the Taliban enough time to re-group, so it is crucial to not stop pressuring the militants until they are defeated.
Some optimists have claimed the light at the end of the tunnel is slowly starting to show. Let’s hope it’s not an illusion.

I reasd what alot of people who live in Afghanistan have to say. those who are not radical muslims or who ae not drug dealers are happy we are there, especially the women who were victimized by the Taliban everyday. Also, as a former Marine, i talk to alot of guys who have spent alot of time there, and know exactly whats going on. As for your claim that Bush went into Iraq under flase pretenses…your wrong. 3 different countries intel agencies were telling Bush the same thing our CIA was telling him, WMD were in Iraq, and we have found evidence that in fact there were, not to mention satellite photos of trucks crossing into Syria before the invasion. You can stick your head in the sand and cater to our enemy’s so people in other countries will “like” you, but the fact is that Saddam was a bad guy who was a threat to world security, and why liberals wanted to let him continue his wrath of terror on his own people mystifies me. If you are so desperate for the world to like you Jack, talk to them about how gererous we are when other countries have disasters. Try NOT blaming the USA for everything, and try FOR ONCE focusing on the generosity of the American people, as that is what truly makes us great. War is somehthing we need to use at times to protect our people so they have the freedom to bad mouth theior own country, like you do.
Rich,
You do realize that U.S. officials made the decision to invade Iraq, and Afghanistan, right? The former on false pretenses? Secondly, have you ever been to Afghanistan? Have you ever spoken to someone from Afghanistan? Are you aware of the way of life prior to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan?
No. I feel very badly for the kids that their parents and other adults are too cowardly to take a stand against those that bring destruction to their country both before and after the US invasion, but other then that…NO. They knew what was going on, and probably could guess what the consequences would be. the Taliban and Saddam were killing civilains long before we got there. hopefully once we are done, the terrorists will have one less place to hide, the civilians can live in peace, and the USA w will be have one less enemy. In war, civilians die, its that simple. We need to worry about our people first.
Rich,
How many Afghani civilians and Iraqi civilians have died since the U.S. invasions? Does that maybe make up for things, in your mind, just a little?
If the “innocent” citizens had stopped the radical factions such as the Taliban from getting power in the first place, AND allowing terrorist training and other activities from taking place on their soil, there would be no American troops there is the first place. The citizens of Afghanistan have some accountability to what takes place in their own country. We are there because they allowed terrorists activities  to go on that resulted in the deaths of 3000 Americans. Instead of being crital of civilan deaths, how about being critical of the countrys citizens for allowing such activities to go on in their country that resulted in the war. I dont think NATO or the US should care what these “anti American activists” think anyway. Most of them are not out there sacrificing for their country, and probably never will. Its disgusting. We are trying to protect our citizens, and all they can do is protest against the very troops that are protecting their soft hineys.
The key to defeating the Taliban is to convince the local people that we’re going to stick around and keep them safe. In the past, people have sided with the Taliban when they expected the US to leave, because the Taliban would simply threaten people, “as soon as they leave, we’re coming right back, so you’d better stay loyal to us.” I think that announcing the entry into Marjah is part of that strategy — establish the expectations among the people that this time, the good guys  are going to stay until permanent security is established.

A wasted opportunity
On Feb. 10, I hurried into a Spectrum event, “Lessons from the Holy Wars: A Pakistani-American Odyssey with Rob Asghar,” afraid to miss the first few minutes. A book promoted at the venue carried the same name. I expected to gain insight into the situation of “Af-Pak,” as they now call it in the media, from a fellow Pakistani-American. But the mystique of the night’s orator, Rob Asghar, was soon unraveled when it became clear his intentions had little to do with the people whose lives were in question. As a Pakistani-American myself, I found this deeply unsettling.
During the Afghan war against the Soviet Union in the early 1980s, the CIA provided massive funds and weapons, and Pakistan, via its expanded religious school (madrassa) system under a military dictator, Gen. Muhammad Zia-ul Haq, who conducted a coup and reigned with the support of far-right religious groups, provided the children to fight in the war.
Asghar claimed to understand religion and society in Pakistan and the Pakistani views regarding the current war in Afghanistan. While Pakistanis themselves have begun openly addressing the legacy of those crucial years to understand their present situation, nothing Asghar mentioned on his own touched upon them. By contrast, the lion’s share of his time was spent discussing a Hollywood version of the story, Charlie Wilson’s War, before he rerouted the talk to himself.
Poverty and jihad have a strong connection. Yet, that evening, the plight of Pakistan’s poor were largely ignored. In the past year, my mother received a poor woman and her son at the front gate of our home in Islamabad. This peasant woman was not there to beg for money or food; she was there because she wanted her child to have a better life. When asked by this woman for directions to a nearby madrassa, my mother winced: “Why do you want to send him there? Don’t you know that upfront these religious men offer to feed, clothe and educate your sons, but what they don’t tell you is that one day they may send him off for jihad?” The woman was startled. My mother immediately offered her an alternative: that she admit her son in the nearby public school and, in return, all of his expenses would be paid for. It was a done deal. In fact, it was one of many.
When one speaks to a lay American audience on foreign issues, one’s oratory skills may either be used for improving the lives of millions and saving lives or for banking off widespread ignorance. “Lessons” clarified which side of the fence Asghar’s preferences lie.
Fareed Butt
Senior, International Relations
Editor’s Note: The Daily Trojan contacted Rob Asghar for his comment.
“I agree with much of Mr. Butt’s analysis of issues surrounding Pakistan. The “Pakistani-American Odyssey” that I write and speak about is less intended to be an objective and exhaustive analysis of Pakistani current events and more of a subjective, memoir-style discussion of how events in my life intersected with larger political events. This discussion typically spans Pakistani culture, American culture, world religions and on and on. I do recognize my flaws as a speaker and writer, but I hope that no one holds it against the good folks at USC Spectrum.”
You really can’t Judge a Book by its Cover:
Maybe Mr. Butt should have read the book and understood the premise of the Spectrum event before attending, and certainly before writing a self absorbed defensive rant. It was obvious Mr. Butt read the title of the book and decided he would attend what he thought would be a rally for the Pakistani plight in the United States.
While Asghar’s book and event gave me insight of the conflicts he dealt with while growing up in a family that has deep religious roots, Butts defensive and off-base retort only made me think about how some people  are so cynical that they shut out everything but what they want to hear and believe.
It was an interesting event.  Not only to hear Rob talk about his family while his brother sat in the audience, but also to look at the diverse group of people in the room listen to what he had to say.  I wondered how they interpreted his comments about his life.  
I watched the 30 year old academic that never left college, or probably his mothers home for that matter, dissect what Rob had to say and reflect how it impacted his own life.
I saw the black judge flinch when Rob commented negatively about Dr. Martin Luther King.  What was this judge thinking?  Was his mind shut off after the comment?  Absolutely not.  He listened closer to Rob’s thoughts.  In fact the judge closed the evening with one of the most insightful questions for Rob.
One gentlemen seated behind me argued and scoffed at Rob’s idea about pulling troops out of the Middle East. Rob certainly didn’t change his mind, however, because of Rob’s non-defensive and non-abrasive response, I saw the man truly think about what Rob’s belief was on the subject.
The event was an enlightening discussion that really centered around Robs understanding of why he took the path in his life that he did.
Most walked away from the evening with a better understanding of how Rob thinks about life, race, religion, politics, his family and his relationships.  I even think his big brother walked away standing tall while thinking, “That was my brother up there…, I am proud of him”.
Bottom line, Mr. Butt should have attended another event.  This event certainly was not for a person with a closed mind and a different agenda. There are plenty of events for you Mr. Butt. If you want Americans to better understand your issues, you should listen to what Rob Asghar has to say and learn to take a different approach.
Butt has pointed out his mother’s commendable work in a self-congratulatory manner. He accuses Asghar of not doing anything for the masses. I invite him to visit the massive school/college/clinic complex his family built from the ground up and supports with 100% personal funds. This is discussed in the book, which Butt really needs to read before making such accusations. A senior in IR should understand that not all pertinent issues can be discussed in one session, especially when the session is related to a book on a personal odyssey. The strange thing here is that there has been no disagreement on Mr Butt’s original point, yet he remains angry.
Butt should write his own book, for crying out loud, as he’s completely missed the point of Asghar’s novel/memoir. What we have here is one Pakistani-American sharing a unique experience with immigrant culture/roots and how it’s intersected his American life, and another fellow Paki-Am criticizing him because those lessons did not provide the answers he was seeking. Tall order to make upon your fellow brother! Instead of sitting in the corner and complaining, Butt should get off his — and add as much to the Paki-Am discussion as Asghar has — through his book, his speaking engagements, his Huff Post column, and his countless news articles that have appeared nationwide. At least, Asghar is using his voice for something good.

Senior gift voting is upon the class of 2010.
The students on the senior gift advisory board who brainstorm ideas for the senior gift have envisioned four ideas: a tribute to retiring USC President Steven B. Sample, a solar thermal energy system for the Lyon Center pool, a Class of 2010 Internship Award or a van for the Volunteer Center.
Each gift is unique and has its own merit. Two of the gifts offer a plaque recognizing our contribution visibly to the student body. The others do not offer something as lasting and physically visible, but instead offer much more: a lasting impression and legacy.
Every dollar the class of 2010 donates for the internship award will be matched by the USC Office of Financial Aid; senior gift organizers expect approximately $20,000 in donations. This gift will fund highly qualified students in financial need in their unpaid internships and volunteering opportunities abroad. There are very few things as life-changing as serving and volunteering abroad or working an unpaid internship to gain job experience.
I know how drastically serving in China after its catastrophic earthquake in 2008 affected me. As the class of 2010, we can provide this sort of experience for many students to come.
President Sample is a man that I look up to very much. I am grateful for all he has done for this university: raising the standard in educational quality, drawing large endowment donations and attracting high-caliber students, all to further the prestige of USC.
But while we should pay tribute to the outgoing university president, I think Sample would prefer we employ our gift to helping others or further the campus as a whole. The senior class will have an opportunity to honor Sample at a celebration later this year.
A solar thermal heating system for our pool is a neat option, but it is the most detached. I am grateful for USC’s efforts to make our campus and university-wide carbon footprint smaller. Not only is this project scheduled to take place without our senior gift, but it has  little influence on people’s lives. If our gift goes to the pool heater, it will account for at most 8 percent of the total cost of the green initiative.
Betsy Avila | Daily Trojan
Senior gift option number four is a van for the USC Volunteer Center. The Volunteer Center will use gift funding to purchase a van to take students without vehicles to volunteer opportunities in the surrounding community. Furthermore, the transportation service will bring neighboring community members to USC for on-campus programs.
This van is the only alternative to the internship award directed at influencing people and communities.
The tribute to Sample and the Lyon Center pool heater would both have much more tangible incarnations than the internship award or the van. When I initially read about the gift options, I wanted something that would flaunt “Class of 2010” somewhere on campus for everyone to see.
But as I considered the plaques of gifts from other classes in the past, I realized that I am disconnected from them; I see their plaque and appreciate their gift, yet I don’t experience any heart-felt connection to the class.
The internship award gives recognition to the class of 2010 with a named learning experience, and the van recognizes our class with the opportunity for continued community service. While these options may not have much physical recognition for the class, they do intimately connect our graduating class to those that will benefit from our contributions.
Instead of some student reading a plaque, a member of the community, student or someone in another country will have 2010 written on his heart as the class that blessed them. We will be the class that made it possible for someone to meet them and possibly serve them. We will be the class that made it possible for a student to go abroad and have a life-changing experience.
Ironically, in doing so, we will honor Sample’s legacy as well.
Let us be a class that offers our gift to the people, to the transformation of hearts and communities. Let us follow in the footsteps of President Sample and give back to the community and the students.
Jensen Carlsen is a senior majoring in mathematics and economics. His column “The Bridge” runs Wednesdays.
The current pool heating system runs off natural gas which is hardly deprecating to the environment. The thermal system is straining a gnat. There are many better and greener opportunities for Trojans to invest in, that have not been sought out by the senior gift board. All-in-all, the thermal system is hardly cost effective and does not change much environmentally.
The Solar Thermal System on the Lyon Center would be a clear values statement from the class of 2010. It would show that the seniors truly believe in creating a more sustainable world and are willing to put their money where their mouth is. I often hear people pushing for sustainability and simultaneously stating that there aren’t enough options to help make a difference. There is no guarantee that this project would happen without the contribution of the seniors. It might make financial sense for the university to invest in energy conservation measures, but I can assure you that there are many less visible projects that have a much quicker payback period than a solar thermal system. If the seniors vote for this, then they are making a clear statement that sustainability and renewable energy are important to them.

“It feels completely insane to write that after 5 years of blood, sweat, tears, and some of the best times of our lives… the Castledoor chapter as we know it is coming to a close.”
And so lead vocalist and lyricist Nate Cole broke the news of beloved area band Castledoor’s dissolution over the group’s blog.
The update, which was posted late Sunday night to both the band’s Blogspot and MySpace, was titled “the best is yet to come” and described the frontman’s inability to believe that Castledoor as we know it was calling it quits.
“I always thought we would be the band that would survive anything,” Cole wrote in the post. “Most of us were actually feeling optimistic about things lately.”
The six-piece outfit consists of two husband-and-wife pairs — the drummer Joel and bassist Brando are, of course, unmarried.
Somewhat expectedly, the split occurred along matrimonial divisions. According to Cole’s statement, it was his longest-standing bandmate, guitarist and keyboardist Gabe Combs, who announced that he was ready to move on from Castledoor, and Combs’ vocalist wife was not mentioned in the list of band members who “plan to continue making music together.”
“We recently finished recording some of our most exciting songs with plans for a photo shoot, video shoot and press,” Cole related to the band’s followers.
The four remaining bandmates will be presumably pressing on with those plans which are already in motion, though perhaps under a new name.
Last night’s performance at Spaceland as an opening act for Princeton is the last event previewed as an upcoming show on the band’s MySpace.
Although it’s unclear where the beloved indie rockers are going from here, the incarnation of Castledoor with which Los Angeles music lovers are familiar will be certainly and sorely missed in the city’s soundscape.

In the wake of a hectic coaching change, a sobering NCAA investigation and the worst season record in nearly a decade, the USC football team is ready to put spring cleaning behind it and look forward to spring practice beginning March 30.
Practices will be held at 4 p.m. every Tuesday and Thursday and at 11 a.m. every Saturday for five consecutive weeks.  The 33-day program ends May 1 with the annual Trojan Huddle scrimmage at the Coliseum.
For head coach Lane Kiffin and six other new names in the USC coaching office, this spring brings opportunity to introduce fans, the media, and the team to the future of the Kiffin administration.  Play calling, practice tempo, and roster selection are yet to be seen; Kiffin hasn’t attended a USC spring practice since he resigned as offensive coordinator after the 2006 season.
Practices will likely be left open to the public as they had been under Pete Carroll and as they were under Kiffin at Tennessee, but no official announcement has been made.
Three new enrollees will also make their first impressions this spring.  Defensive back Patrick Hall, receiver Kyle Prater and running back Dillon Baxter are all onboard early to begin training for the 2010 season.
The Trojans will have more new recruits on the field than quarterbacks — Matt Barkley should be ready to go despite recent wrist surgery, and Mitch Mustain will share snaps under center.
New secondary coach Willie Mack Garza will have his work cut out for him in his first practices as a Trojan.  USC replaces four defensive backs including All-American safety Taylor Mays and seniors Kevin Thomas, Will Harris, and Josh Pinkard.

Six out of 10 Americans feel universities are more interested pursuing bottom lines than quality educations, according to a new study.
These findings, from a series of surveys conducted in December 2009 by research organization Public Agenda for the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, point to a trend of increasing skepticism among the public toward college administrations.
Of the 1,031 Americans surveyed, the majority felt universities could admit a lot more students without lowering quality or raising prices, and that colleges could spend less and still maintain a high quality of education.
Sixty-four percent felt that federal stimulus money should be used to hold down tuition and fees, even if it means universities will have less to spend on operations and programs.
The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education has been conducting surveys with the assistance of Public Agenda since 1993. The ongoing study has documented two prominent trends in American public opinion: a belief in the necessity of higher education as a guarantor of success and a concern that this education is becoming increasingly less available to qualified students.
According to Public Agenda’s findings, published in “Squeeze Play 2010: Continued Public Anxiety on Cost, Harsher Judgments on How Colleges are Run,” these two “colliding trends” have created a “squeeze play,” as the public invests more importance in higher education while perceiving it as less available.
“Clearly one factor in Americans’ concerns about access to higher education is their perception of the escalating cost of tuition and fees at colleges and universities. Today, nearly two-thirds (65 percent) continue to say that higher education prices are rising at a faster rate compared to other things, up seven percentage points from 2007,” the study reported.
Public concern over rising costs “remains at record highs,” according to the published study.  Eighty-three percent of those surveyed said they felt students have to borrow too much to cover the cost of tuition, and 65 percent said they thought college prices were growing at a faster rate than other things.
With the rising cost of tuition, the number of parents of high school students who believe their children will attend college has dropped since the recession. In 2007, 61 percent of those surveyed felt it was likely their child would continue their education after graduation. The latest survey revealed that the number has fallen to 59 percent.

Stars flock to Shrine for 41st Annual NAACP Awards 
Numerous famous African-American actors, authors, directors, and recording artists will descend upon the Shine Auditorium this Friday evening for the 41st Annual NAACP Image Awards show. Each year the NAACP celebrates the outstanding achievements and performances of people of color in the arts (motion picture, television, recording and literature).
This year, notable award nominees and attendees include Gabourey Sidibe (Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture), Jamie Foxx (Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture), Anika Noni Rose (Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture), Sandra Bullock (Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture), Taraji P. Henson (Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture), Monique’ (Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture), Mariah Carey (Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture), and Zoe Saldana (Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture). Tyler Perry, will receive the NAACP Chairman’s Award. Several other celebs will be in attendance including Will Smith, Alicia Keys, Beyonce’ and Jennifer Hudson.
We’re wondering if Lil’Wayne will be able to make it before his jail time?
The awards show will be broadcast from the historic Shrine Auditorium this Friday, Feb. 26 at 10 p.m. PST on FOX. Though the show will not be broadcast live on the West Coast, you can still gather at 4 p.m. across Jefferson Street on USC campus to see the stars arrive for the red carpet.
Shutter Island brings home weekend No. 1
They’re back! Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio’s newest film, Shutter Island, was the number one movie at the box office this weekend. The movie made an impressive $40.2 million at the end of Sunday evening. Though it didn’t beat the $54 million that Valentine’s Day made last weekend, it did get close to Tyler Perry’s Madea Goes to Jail for the second largest February opening in three years.
The Departed, the movie that marked Scorsese and DiCaprio’s best collaboration, earned only $26 million in its opening weekend.
You would think that this would not have been DiCaprio’s biggest opening. Up until this month he was in the number one highest grossing movie of all time, Titanic, until it was replaced by James Cameron’s Avatar.
There was speculation about Paramount Pictures moving the release date from October to February. Critics wondered if it the push back was a sign that the movie was not going to do well, but it’s looking good right now!
Who’s Threatening Fantasia? 
American Idol winner, Fantasia Barrio, has a stalker! Barrino, who is currently staring in hit musical The Color Purple, came across a death-threat letter while going through her fan mail after her performance on Thursday night. It all happened here in Los Angeles at the Pantages Theatre where the show is scheduled to be until the end of this week. The letter was loaded with racial slurs, the N-word, and a line that read, “go back to where you came from and die.” Also in the letter, the person claims to have worked for her security while being a contestant on American Idol.
Fantasia’s team has heightened security around her and around the venue. Fantasia told TMZ,
“I will not be defeated by one isolated person’s hatred.”
You go girl!
The Color Purple will be at the Pantages Theatre until Feb. 28. Tickets are $25 – $85.
Idol Controversy? Of Course. 
The ‘Top 24’ was revealed last Wednesday night on American Idol. This week the show will resume with all of those 24 – except one. Contestant Chris Golightly, who was announced in the 24 last Wednesday, was replaced last minute by Contestant Tim Urban (no connection to Keith, that we can find). According to a press release from FOX last week, it was determined that Golightly was ineligible to continue in the competition. He was the contestant who touched hearts with his back-story of being in foster care.
Fellow contestant Samantha Musa said she talked to Golightly and said he was disqualified yesterday, “after already being told he was in the top 24, over some bogus old contract.” FOX didn’t mention any specific details about why Golightly was let go in their press release on the issue.
Nationwide controversy surrounded last week’s episode of Idol when many heart-touching contestants were let go. Many questioned why some people who violated contest rules were allowed to stay, while others like three-time contestant Angela Martin did not.
You may remember Martin from the previous two seasons. The first time she made it to Hollywood week, her father was murdered and she had to leave the contest. The second time, Idol officials had to let her go because a warrant from unpaid parking tickets. This season was her last shot before becoming too old to participate next year. News of her being let go was not made better by hearing that her mother has been missing since December.
What is your take on the ‘Top 24’?

After blasting its way to a series win over Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, Calif., last weekend, the USC baseball team will look to open up its home schedule with a win when USC starts its series with  Loyola Marymount today.
Group effort · Junior infielder Joe De Pinto, pictured here last season, was among the Trojans who performed well in last weekend’s series. - Daily Trojan file photo 
“We haven’t played well the last couple of years at home,” USC coach Chad Kreuter said. “Even before I got here we were struggling.”
Having started 2-6 at Dedeaux Field last season, it is imperative for his team to get off to a strong start at home, Kreuter said.
“The importance is that we want to rack up as many wins as we can, and that starts this week,” he said.
Taking the mound for the Trojans (2-1) today will be Ben Mount. Mount will be on two days rest after a three-inning relief appearance Saturday in which he allowed two runs on five hits. Kreuter expects four to five solid innings out of the 6-foot-8, right-handed sophomore.
“We are expecting him to keep growing as a pitcher and to keep us competitive,” Kreuter said. “We want him to give us some innings and work into a bullpen that is loaded with good arms.”
USC will look to continue swinging the sticks like it did against Cal Poly over the weekend, when USC batted a combined .321.
The Trojan hitters will look to take advantage of a LMU pitching staff that allowed 33 runs to nationally ranked UC Irvine. The Lions’ pitchers didn’t get much help from the fielders behind them after their defense committed six errors, including five in Saturday’s 9-6 loss — the closest game of the series.
LMU (0-4) also showed a susceptibility to giving up big innings, allowing three or more runs on six different occasions over the weekend.
The Lions, however, can be a dangerous team, as they demonstrated last season when they went 9-2 against ranked teams, losing only to UC Irvine.
“They’ll be fine,” Kreuter said yesterday on his way to Marina Del Rey, Calif., to scout the Lions’ game against Oregon. “There’s no spring training, so everyone is still trying to figure out their rotation and lineup.”
The Trojans are trying to get those minor issues settled prior to their upcoming big weekend where they will play national powers Oklahoma State, Vanderbilt and crosstown rival UCLA.
The Trojans are also hoping to see a large student contingency in the stands.
“Maybe we need a call to arms or something,” Kreuter said. “But the kids are excited to play at home, so we’d love to get better attendance than we’ve had [in Kreuter’s first three seasons as head coach].”
“But in the end, it’s a shame on us if we don’t play well in such a nice complex,” he said.
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated USC batted a combined .229 against Cal Poly.
Can one game be considered a series? An editor shouldn’t have changed it to that just to sound snazzy.  I know Shotgun Spratling would never write that.

The USC women’s tennis team returns to California but remains on the road today for a nonconference dual match against the San Diego State Aztecs at 1:30 p.m.
The Women of Troy are aiming to get back on a winning track after a competitive stretch at the ITA National Team Indoors in Wisconsin two weekends ago. USC defeated No. 14 Clemson in the first round but then tarnished its perfect record by falling to both No. 1 Duke and No. 5 Baylor.
This caused USC (6-2) to drop from No. 7 to No. 9 in this week’s ITA team rankings. SDSU also dropped from No. 48 to No. 60 this week.
The Aztecs are 4-3 on the year and are led by junior Julia Trunk in singles play. Trunk was unranked in last month’s singles rankings but now holds the No. 58 spot. Trunk has won three straight singles matches at the No. 1 singles spot, including an upset of No. 11 Venise Chan of Washington.
USC junior Maria Sanchez boasts a 7-1 overall record in singles after posting an impressive takedown of Duke’s No. 20 singles player, Reka Zsilinszka . This helped improve Sanchez’s singles ranking from No. 8 to No. 3.
Women of Troy sophomore Alison Ramos increased her national ranking from No. 39 to No. 19.
USC’s two other ranked singles players, freshmen Valeria Pulido and Danielle Lao, are both 6-2 but fell in this month’s rankings from No. 37 to No. 51 and from No. 18 to No. 31, respectively.
USC is 35-4 all-time against the Aztecs after posting a 7-0 sweep of SDSU last season. The Women of Troy have also won the last 13 matches dating back to the 1994 season, including eight straight shutouts.

The NCAA committee completed its three-day hearing Saturday night on the alledged infractions committed by the University of Southern California athletic department.
The accusations stem from possible violations made by USC basketball and football players dating back to at least 2005.
One of two dozen participants in the hearings included new USC football coach Lane Kiffen.  “I’ve never moved less in a 72-hour period,” Kiffin said after the meeting.
Although the hearings usually feature several universities presenting numerous cases, this hearing was reserved for USC only.
David Price, NCAA’s vice president for enforcement services, called it the longest infractions meeting he had ever been to.
Of the three-day hearing, two days were dedicated to football alone, punctuated by the 2006 Yahoo! Sports report that former USC running back Reggie Bush received as much as $300,000 in gifts during his time at the school.
The committee is also investigating after ESPN and Yahoo! reported that former USC basketball star O.J. Mayo also received gifts on multiple occasions.
The NCAA’s decision to place any sanctions on USC including any punishments or fines will take at least six weeks, but considering the complexity of the case (there were seven boxes of documents used during the hearing), it could take longer.
The severity of the punishments will depend on the extent to which the university and coaches’ had knowledge of the violations.
Other notable attendees were former football coach Pete Carroll, running backs coach Todd McNair, former basketball coach Tim Floyd and current basketball assistant, Bob Cantu.

For most students, tossing their caps into the air at the end of commencement culminates their four years at USC.
But for some, it only marks the end to a semester.
Pomp and circumstance · For fall graduates, the spring commencement ceremony does not mark the end of their USC careers. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Most of the students who will be ordering class rings and learning about commencement at this week’s Grad Fair are in their eighth semester — seniors graduating after four years.
Not every senior, however, follows a stringent four-year path to graduation. There are a handful of students who graduate in the fall semester, either to finish degree requirements or to prepare for jobs or graduate school.
“I had this drive to prove that I could work,” said Katy Reid, a fall 2009 graduate with a bachelor of arts in theatre, who graduated a semester early. “For me, graduating was a part of getting out in the real world.”
According to Ray Gonzales, senior director of research and reporting for the Office of Academic Records and Registrar, there have historically been about 900 fall graduates each December at USC. Last fall, that number declined slightly, but it has been increasing overall in the past few years.
Gene Bickers, vice provost for undergraduate programs, said a growing number of fall graduates are students who are staying an extra semester rather than leaving a semester early.
“The number of December grads has increased marginally over the past several years, but there has been no large-scale trend,” Bickers wrote in an e-mail. “More students graduate late than early, largely because they are pursuing multiple majors or minors, or because they have made a late change of major.”
Students who finish their degrees in the fall semester are given a fall conferral date but are treated almost identically to spring graduates.
Any student who graduates in the fall semester will still be recognized in the spring commencement booklet of his class year, which includes the prior fall.
Since USC only offers one commencement ceremony, fall graduates are allowed to walk in the graduation ceremony prior to their graduation or in the spring ceremony after they receive their degrees.
“I’m going to walk with the class of 2010 because I started with them,” said Ashley Zimmerman, a fall 2009 graduate with a bachelor of arts in broadcast journalism. “I want to end my college career with the same friendships I created freshman year.”
For some students, the commencement ceremony is a time to share their accomplishments with their family members.
“I’ll be at the ceremony, but my decision could have gone either way. It’s a whole family thing, and it’s for my parents as much as for me,” said Mike Joyce, a fall 2009 graduate with a bachelor of arts in broadcast journalism.
Nelson Shirota, student services manager, said typically many fall graduates attend the ceremony unless circumstances preclude them from being in Los Angeles.
“We have thousands of participants, and they are the ones who want to show up to display all of their hard work,” Shirota said.
Though fall graduates are given equal opportunities to participate in commencement activities, including the Baccalaureate Ceremony and the Baccalaureate Dinner, some fall graduates said they feel they are missing out on parts of the graduation experience.
“I live with 10 seniors who are all in their second semester. They’re going through this stage where they feel liberated, but they also have a fear of what’s to come. But I went through that by myself,” Reid said.
Zimmerman, too, said she feels slightly disconnected from the graduation experience.
“I’m missing out on the last time to go to [Traditions, an on-campus bar], my last invite and my last class. My last class was a very individual experience because everyone else still had another semester. It was more of a surreal experience for me,” she said.
Though early or late graduates might miss out on some of the traditions, Bickers said that academically there is no disadvantage.
“It depends on the student, but I would not say that most December graduates miss out on opportunities by finishing early,” Bickers wrote. “They are still eligible for university honors, including the Renaissance, Discovery and Global Scholars programs. There is no single answer to whether early graduation is a good thing — it really depends on individual circumstances.”
Although Reid and Zimmerman might have some qualms with graduating early, both feel that it was the right decision academically and financially.
Casey Patrick, a fall 2009 graduate who received her bachelor of arts in business administration, recognized that if she had remained at USC for her spring semester, she would have remained in her comfort zone.
“It would have been really easy for me to stay [at USC]. But [leaving USC] is more of a challenge. In some ways, it is kind of harder, and now I’ve just been thrown into the real world,” she said.

Though many universities nationwide are trimming their budgets and tightening their purse strings, few are cutting costs when it comes to patents and licensing, and USC is no exception.
Patents and licenses can be expensive undertakings, but the reward is typically worth it. A recent survey by the Chronicle of Higher Education showed that USC brought in $7,270,538 in licensing in 2008, ranking 37th in the country. In the same year, USC applied for 135 patents and was issued 41. Additionally, the school formed five start-up companies.
At the university level, patents can be very useful for the wide range of discoveries that occur on campus with the extensive amount of research constantly being done.
The USC Stevens Institute for Innovation helps innovators at the school apply for patents and licenses.
“One of the missions [of USC Stevens] is to get ideas out into society and sometimes you need intellectual property protection,” said Richard Hull, senior director for innovation advancement at USC Stevens.
Hull said patents can cost up to $1,000 per country.
Though patents are costly, inventions that are successful bring money back to the inventor.
Hull gave the hypothetical example that if someone created a drug with cancer-curing abilities at the Keck School of Medicine the Stevens Institute would help him file for patent protection for his product.
If it received this patent, it would enter a license agreement with a company, which would in turn take the drug through the necessary chemical trials. If the drug were to be successful, USC and the inventor would receive a certain percentage of the revenue.
Hull said that most of the money received through this process goes back to the schools that made the discoveries.
“The money comes into USC Stevens and then we distribute it out, either to the schools, the proper office or the inventors themselves,” Hull said.
Although the income from the 2008 fiscal year topped $7 million, Hull stated that this number varies year to year.
“We try to forecast how much licensing we’re going to get, but it is subject to significant fluctuations,” Hull said.
Hull said he was pleased with USC’s national ranking, though he hopes to see the university’s licensing income increase over the next few years.
Hull said USC patents potential drugs, medical devices, electromechanical devices and methanol fuel technologies, among other innovations.
Behrokh Khoshnevis, director of the Center for Rapid Automated Fabrication Technologies, is working on one such innovation. He has spent the last few years working on an automated construction project called Contour Crafting, with funding  from USC Stevens.
Contour Crafting technology is an innovation that will automate the construction of structures and sub-components.
“Using this process, a single house or a colony of houses, each with possibly a different design, may be automatically constructed in a single run, embedded in each house all the conduits for electrical, plumbing and air conditioning,” according to Khoshnevis’ website.
He has received a number of patents for this project, the most recent coming last January for the robotic aspects of the project.
USC Stevens has helped Khoshnevis by paying for the different patents for his work. However, he has not yet received any licenses for this project.
“We’ve received a lot of interest and inquiries but no license yet,” said Khoshnevis, who is also a professor in the department of industrial and systems engineering.
He plans to further this project through “experimentation and improvement.”
The licensing process, however, has been affected by the economic downturn, according to Hull. Though this has not yet affected licensing revenue, Hull suspects it will in the future.
“We will see some of the effects in the years to come,” he said.
Hull did not yet have figures on how the licensing income changed in the 2009 fiscal year.

When Hanna Reisler began studying physical chemistry in college, she had no intention of re-entering the classroom. Thirty years and a change in career path later, she has been named the recipient of the second annual Provost’s Mentoring Award for her contributions to USC.
Mentor · Chemistry professor Hanna Reisler began working at USC in 1977 and began teaching in 1987. In 2007, she earned the Mellon Mentoring award. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
“It’s ironic. The original idea was seeing myself working in a lab, not teaching,” said Reisler, a professor of chemistry in the USC College of Letters, Arts & Sciences. “I realized you can combine them, and it turned out to be the best of both worlds.”
Reisler grew up in Israel, where she completed her undergraduate and graduate studies and worked as a physical chemist until 1977.
“I was always interested in why things work the way they do — not making new materials but understanding reactions and using mathematics and physics to explain them. I did my master’s in organic chemistry, but I found myself asking other questions,” she said. “For my Ph.D., I switched to physical chemistry.”
Reisler moved to the United States in 1977 and joined USC as a research scientist.
Ten years later, she began teaching and is now helping others get involved in teaching as well.
“We had many discussions about how, as post-[doctorates], there wasn’t much opportunity to get experience teaching,” said Andrew Mollner, who has worked with Reisler on post-doctorate research since 2008. “She led a push for that to happen in the chemistry department, and this year they introduced the Burg teaching fellowships.”
Twenty years into her teaching career, in 2007, Reisler received the Mellon Mentoring Award, and in 2009 she was nominated for the Provost’s Mentoring Award.
“[Reisler] has been an exceptional model for junior faculty as well as for students and post-docs, particularly those who are women,” said Department of Chemistry Chair Charles McKenna, who wrote a letter supporting Reisler’s nomination. “Mentors should lead by example, and she has done so with her own academic career.”
Reisler works with students at all levels ­— from freshmen to post-doctorate students.
“I really like to teach freshmen because these are people in transition,” she said. “They go from high school to a very different system. We want to make them independent thinkers, and that’s something that is very satisfying to me.”
Though she works with a large variety of students, Reisler makes a point of individualizing her advice and mentoring students when they need to be pushed.
“Of all the people I’ve worked with, she’s the best at getting to know the people working for her,” Mollner said. “It’s a testament to her caring that she doesn’t treat everybody the same. She encourages them when they need to be encouraged and pushes them when they need to be pushed. She’s great at personalizing her interactions.”
Beyond her teaching, Reisler is an internationally renowned researcher published in more than 160 journals. She also established the Women in Science and Engineering program and has been involved in other programs aimed at enhancing involvement in science.
“Besides one-on-one mentoring, she’s also creating structures to mentor future students,” McKenna said.
Ten years ago, she established the WiSE program to encourage female participation in traditionally male-dominated fields.
The program, which began with an anonymous $20 million donation, provides research fellowships and child-care resources for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctorate students. Participants meet once a month as an informal networking group.
Reisler also mentors for the Female Undergraduates Educating and Leading in Science program and serves as head of the chemistry department’s graduate student advisory committee. She helped to set up the interdisciplinary Program in Drug Discovery, an organization to help graduate students interested in medicinal chemistry.
In addition to her research and involvement in student programs, Reisler is currently the Lloyd Armstrong Jr. Chair for Science and Engineering, and she teaches Advanced General Chemistry for incoming students.
Despite being known as a “mentor extraordinaire” by her students and fellow faculty, Reisler lacked a similar role model during her studies in Israel.
“Those were very different times,” she said. “I went for my entire undergraduate career without ever talking to a teacher or going to office hours. We didn’t have mentors, but we, the students, helped each other.”
She has, however, fully embraced her title as a mentor at USC.
“She’s an outstanding teacher with an incredible passion for mentorship,” said McKenna of Reisler. “She has made enormous contributions on multiple fronts, as a scientist, educator, mentor, administrator and model.”
Reisler responds to this with characteristic modesty.
“Being a mentor is a two-way street. You talk to people, and you learn from them,” she said. “[The award] means the university recognizes that that’s a very important part of the culture at USC. I’m just a representative of the larger group of people who are doing it.”

USC’s Department of Public Safety is letting students make the call on how they prefer to stay safe on campus.
The Undergraduate Student Government is currently surveying student interest in a program that would transform students’ phones into mobile panic buttons.
The Rave Guardian Mobile Safety Program features a one-touch panic button. Once students register their phones, they gain access to the panic button feature, which when pressed sends the student’s name, photo and location to DPS.
The program is accessible on any phone — not just smart phones — because it transforms one of the physical buttons on the handset into a panic button that activates when held down, much like speed dial.
DPS Capt. Antonia Young said she thinks the program is more effective than speed dial because it automatically sends DPS a student’s vital information.
“What makes the panic button more effective than just calling DPS is the fact that it allows us to actually have your GPS location. Once the button is pressed, DPS automatically knows your name, what you look like and where you were last at with your phone,” Young said.
The program also comes with a time mode feature, which is a precautionary timer that students can set before they leave to walk somewhere. The student inputs the approximate time they think it will take to reach the destination and deactivates the timer once he gets there safely. If something goes wrong, however, DPS is alerted.
DPS reached out to USG for help gauging student interest.
“We were approached by DPS about a new program that would engage student support,” said USG Director of Campus Affairs Helen Moser. “The survey came up because we didn’t want to recommend the program without going to the students first.”
Rave Guardian is one of the many companies DPS is considering for this new type of phone security, but they do not want to invest money in a program students aren’t going to use.
“The introduction of this program is solely based on student participation,” Young said.
Young said one benefit to the program, however, is that students can choose whether or not to participate.
“What makes this program more effective is that it’s an opt-in program, so students can decide when they want to use the security option,” Young said. “We don’t set the timer, they do. It’s just another layer of security for students on campus.”
Students have mixed views about whether the program would be useful.
Many said they already have enough options for contacting security in case of an emergency.
“If anything, I could see more girls using the program more over guys,” said Jac’Quez Page, a freshman majoring in psychology. “As a guy, I really wouldn’t feel the need to use a panic button or timer in many situations. Having DPS emergency on speed dial is enough for me.”
Others, however, thought it could be useful.
“I would use the panic button because I’ve been in a situation where I haven’t had enough time to talk to DPS over the phone,” said Yasmina Khulusi, a freshman majoring in international relations (global business). “If I’m out by myself at night, it would be a quick way to contact security.”
The USG Mobile Safety Survey has generated about 165 responses so far, and USG says hope to increase that number.
