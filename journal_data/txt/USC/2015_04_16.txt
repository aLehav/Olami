Undergraduate Student Government held a SpeakSC forum Thursday at the University Religious Center allowing multicultural assemblies to discuss ways to promote diversity among students.
The multicultural assemblies represented were the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, Black Student Assembly, International Student Assembly, Queer & Ally Student Assembly, Latino Student Assembly and Women’s Student Assembly.
Andy Su, USG assistant director of diversity affairs, moderated the discussion.
The forum gave the assemblies an opportunity to update students on current projects and what they plan to achieve next year.
APASA wants to make sure they are representing every community that falls under the Asian Pacific American demographic and expressed the need for more resources from USG.
BSA plans to maintain social media campaigns and continue to support the Black House initiative. The assembly has also formed a new position on their executive board, unity chair, to manage, coordinate, and maintain initiatives brought to BSA throughout the year as well as provide resources ad information about the black community at large.
QuASA plans to cultivate a home for students to find and claim their true identity as well as deconstruct barriers for those who identify as queer.  The assembly will also continue to push for gender-neutral public spaces on campus.
LSA expressed the need for more inclusion of the local community surrounding USC.  It will also open up discussion with its member organizations through roundtable discussions.
ISA expressed a need for more inclusion and recognition of international students on campus. The group plans to help international students assimilate into American culture through workshops, cultural information resource centers and increased inclusivity programs during summer orientation.
WSA is looking to change the name of its assembly to make it more inclusive.
The assembly is planning to bring more attention to sexual assault of both men and women through a peer-education program, and by working more closely with the Center for Women & Men.
Students were also given the opportunity to ask questions or address concerns regarding diversity to the members of the assemblies.
John Vitzileos, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said that he felt minority groups should be better protected in residential environments.
“I think ResEd and the housing community at large can do a better job when it comes to safety with students of minority presence in housing situations,” Vitzileos said.
As the discussion progressed to include talks of how to further unite the campus environment, students in the audience were asked to suggest ideas for making USC a more inclusive environment.
Nnenna Ezeh, a senior majoring in health and humanity, said that in order to achieve a more accepting community, the various special interest groups will have to work with each other to move forward.
“In terms of the collaboration, especially addressing issues that affect a specific part of your communities,” Ezeh said. “Maybe you can come together and have a discussion together about issues that intersect within various communities.”
Su closed the discussion by introducing the new Bias Reporting Initiative that diversity affairs and the cultural assemblies hope to enact.  The system would create an anonymous reporting system to report complaints where students feel stereotyped.
USG Vice President Jordan Fowler wants to use what was said at the diversity forum to figure out how to collaborate and create concrete solutions to the assemblies’ problems.
Fowler wants to work closely within USG with the assemblies in the coming year and get them a seat at the table with administration, so the assemblies can advocate directly for their communities.
“USC wouldn’t run without students so if students are not happy, USC is not doing its job,” Fowler said.  “There are so many opportunities that this forum alluded to for us to step up as students advocates.”

Special Olympics World Games celebrated its 100 Days Away Activation Thursday at the corner of McClintock Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard in anticipation of the upcoming summer games.
Several locations throughout Los Angeles will be used for the games, including various venues at USC. The Los Angeles MemorialColiseum will host the opening and closing ceremonies while other campus facilities like the Galen Center, Cromwell Field and the Uytengsu Aquatic Center will host sporting events. This summer will be the first time since 1984 that Los Angeles has hosted a summer Special Olympics World Games.
The 100 Days Away event was celebrated in several areas in Southern California, with host towns putting on local festivities. Residents of Huntington Beach piled surfboards on the sand, while the city of Santa Monica lit up the Ferris wheel with colors matching the Special Olympics World Games logo. Los Angeles International Airport also participated in promotion of the event by lighting up the airport’s pylons with the Game’s colors. A mural for the Games was further unveiled at the Coliseum.
At USC, the event promoted awareness of the games by inviting students to take pictures with the Circle of Inclusion, a symbolic ring reflecting the logo’s colors. McCall Hall, director of communication relations and fan development for the games, said the logo represents connections among participants.
“The circle features colors from each one of the delegations that is coming this summer. It also represents the diversity in L.A. in general,” Hall explained. “The figure in the middle of the circle is striking a celebratory pose. There’s been a lot of medical research and findings that indicate, even if you’re deaf or [blind], you still — out of excitement and joy — raise your arms.”
The event also featured Uncle Bob’s Honey Dipped Fried Chicken food truck, and a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Special Olympics. The owner, Robert Copher, offered his truck for the event because of his close connection with Special Olympics, since he has a daughter with autism who bowls and plays soccer.
“Normally, we’re parked downtown so I was supposed to be somewhere else today. But for this cause I would absolutely be here,” Copher said.
Hall said the main goal of the event is to secure attendance for the sporting events, and she said USC students who will be near USC over the summer are encouraged to attend. According to Hall, the only ticketed events are the opening and closing ceremonies. The sporting events are otherwise for students.
“We have a goal of 500,000 people coming out. We have 25 sports at 27 different venues this summer. The Galen Center will host basketball every single day so we’ve got space for 4,500 every day,” she said. “We have athletes coming from around the world, and one thing we don’t want is for the athletes to come to empty stands. So we have a program called ‘Fans in the Stands’ that is all about creating an atmosphere of excitement for our athletes.”
Erica Barin, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, plans to volunteer for the summer games. Barin, who works at the student health center, said her interest in kids with disabilities carried over into the Special Olympics.
“I’ve been really into … helping kids out in general. Having this event happen on campus is really cool so it’s the best of both worlds for me,” Barin said.
The opening ceremony will take place on July 25 at the Coliseum. The rest of the games will take place from July 26 through Aug. 2.

The Annenberg Innovation Lab hosted the 2015 Evening of Innovation on Thursday evening to showcase the year’s Innovation Lab projects and six cutting-edge startups competing for a $10,000 funding prize.
The evening was sponsored by Maury Domengeaux and Blackstone Launchpad USC.
Each team completed the eight-week CRUNCH Student Design Challenge + Incubator program prior to the evening. The course consisted of activities that helped the startups test and develop their brand and consumer demand. Mentors also shared expertise with students during the business incubator to help improve the startups.
The night marked the second Evening of Innovation and the fifth year of the CRUNCH Student Design Challenge + Incubator.
Erin Reilly, creative director for the Annenberg Innovation Lab, said the evening is a formal presentation of what the lab has been working on.
“The Evening of Innovation is an opportunity for the Annenberg Innovation Lab and all of its programs and researchers to come together and share with the public what we’ve been up to in the past year,” Reilly said. “It’s not only the startups that we do, but it’s also the applied research. There are 30-plus people in the Lab working … and a whole gamut of research fellows with very diverse expertise and they’re sharing with you tonight what they’ve been up to.”
Francesca Smith, research associate at the Innovation Lab, said the judges looked at multiple qualities to select the winner.
“[The judges] will be looking at how innovative the teams are [and] how viable their [products are],” Smith said. “[Judges will look at] whether [the startup] is differentiated in some core way from other players in the market, whether it provides a level of social justice and basically makes the world a better place, whether the teams are really polished and have in some way shown that they really care and put a lot of effort into this product and finally just that sort of indescribable wow factor.”
The teams competing were ElemenTerra, HexCare, LOUDER, Prefound, Prevail Games, Bridge to Solas and Stunt Players.
Geoffrey Long, technical director and research fellow at the lab, said the functions of the competing startups differ from one another.
“The main motivation varies from start-up to start-up — some of them have more of a social good at their core,” Long said. “Prevail Games, for example, is trying to figure out how to use video games in order to help trauma survivors reacclimate themselves into their day-to-day lives. Others are a little more multipurpose. LOUDER is an app that allows multiple phones to chain together to serve as speakers for a single audio source.”
Prefound, an online start-up that gives thrift shop consumers the ability to shop online, ultimately won the fund and was the 2015 CRUNCH Student Design Challenge winner.
Alex Zhang, CEO of Prefound, said the current way to thrift shop online isn’t easy enough.
“With the recent dependency on having a digital footprint, [thrift] stores are now moving on the e-commerce platforms — [such as] Etsy and eBay,” Zhang said. “This has clearly laid out a very obvious problem. These current solutions aren’t designed for clothing discovery; they’re designed for specific search functionality.”
In addition, Zhang said he would help those stores with his startup.
“The supply comes from these stores who are currently hosting on Etsy and Amazon and the demand comes from shoppers like us who are looking for really rare, curated finds,” Zhang said.
Alexx Murphy, founder and president of Prevail Games, said CRUNCH helped her create her start-up.
“These [mentors] have so much experience — they are so knowledgeable and that’s kind of how this [game] became to be,” Murphy said. “It would be a completely different thing, even at this same stage of development, if it hadn’t been for them.”

The Interfraternity Council is holding its first-ever WE CARE, USC Greeks Stand Against Sexual Violence program this week in recognition of Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
The three-day initiative encourages students to take the pledge against sexual assault and to raise money for the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center.
“We wanted the initiative to be by the leaders of our Greek community, but we wanted it to be for all of USC,” said Eric Miller, president of Sigma Chi. “Every student deserves to feel safe on this campus. That was our main motive for initiating this week.”
IFC began the initiative at Tommy Trojan, where Greeks distributed red wristbands to those who took the pledge.
“It’s been really great to see a lot of people on campus with the wristbands on,” Alex Budde, president of Phi Delta Theta, said. “The idea is that you see people on The Row on a Thursday or Friday night with these red wristbands on, and it’s a reminder that this is an issue that we want to do what we can to stop.”
The initiative continued with a screening of The Hunting Ground, a documentary about rape on college campuses, followed by a discussion with Liz Lee, a clinical social worker at the Center for Women and Men, student community leaders and representatives from DPS. On Thursday, IFC raised money for the rape treatment center with a raffle and donut sale.
“The Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center is pretty much the only non-USC resource for greater Los Angeles, and funding is obviously something that they would really benefit from,” Miller said. “Raising awareness is obviously great and really important, but raising money is always a great thing for the victims who are seeking help there.”
Miller said that he and other fraternity presidents came up with the idea for WE CARE. at an IFC retreat, where they discussed issues they are passionate about. Together they created a task force to spearhead the event.
“It’s really cool that this was started by a few presidents who stepped up and wanted to get involved in the issue [of sexual assault],” said IFC President Jake Simon. “We recognize it as an issue on our campus, and we as fraternity leaders have the ability to really make a difference.”
Working closely with the Center for Women and Men and RISE Student Alliance, the fraternity members planned how best to involve the campus in their dialogue about sexual assault.
“We’re tackling this issue for the first time ourselves, so we really wanted to reach out to the people who know their stuff,” Miller said. “It’s a Greek-initiated project, but we wanted to bring to the surface all that USC has to offer.”
The event’s Facebook page has more than 450 RSVPs and hundreds of students took the pledge against sexual assault this week. Both Greek and non-Greek community members took notice of WE CARE. and became involved in the week’s events.
“I’m really happy that people have received it so well,” Miller said. “One of my favorite conversations was with a woman who walked up to me and said, ‘Is this one of those fraternity things that you’re required to do?’ and I took a lot of pride in saying ‘No, this is something we initiated ourselves. We’re really passionate about changing the culture on campus and making sure that USC is safe for everyone.’ It’s something for everyone to really rally behind.”
Because of the week’s success, IFC plans to hold WE CARE. events next April, too, Budde said.
“We have had so many people come by the table to sign the pledge and donate to the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center in just three days, and the documentary screening panel started a great discussion,” said Peter Roberson, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering. “This is a great start into introducing this issue to a large portion of the student body.”

The annual Los Angeles Times Festival of Books is back in full swing at USC’s University Park campus from April 18 to April 19.  As the largest literary and cultural festival in the country, the Festival of Books is marking its 20th year as a Southern California tradition of celebrating ideas, creativity and the written word.
Among the many guest speakers scheduled to appear this year are Maria Bello, T.C. Boyle, LeVar Burton, Roy Choi, Billy Idol, Richard Riordan, Jason Segel and Octavia Spencer.
This year’s festival includes a new feature, the Los Angeles Times Ideas Exchange, a paid event that will take place on Sunday afternoon at Bovard Auditorium. The event will feature author and New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell in conversation with Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan to discuss his latest bestseller David and Goliath. Tickets for the event are sold out.
The festival will include a variety of panel discussions featuring topics such as the future of food in Los Angeles and how books can be transformed into movies. Events will be held at various locations across campus, including the Ray Stark Theater, Wallis Annenberg Hall and Hancock Foundation Building.
More than 150,000 Southern Californians are expected to attend the event to meet authors, listen to speeches, watch musical performances and dine on foods provided by various vendors.
This is the fifth consecutive year that USC has hosted the Festival of Books. Before the festival was brought to USC, the Los Angeles Times hosted the annual event at UCLA, but moved it due to budget issues within the UC system. President C. L. Max Nikias has expressed pride over the university successfully hosting the event.
“USC is extremely proud to host this exceptional event for the fifth consecutive year,” Nikias said in a statement. “Throughout the weekend, more than 160,000 people will visit our campus, making this the largest and most prestigious literary festival in the nation. This weekend will be festive and exciting, as we champion literature, music, film, and art, while celebrating community, creativity, and intellectual curiosity.”
Nikias encouraged USC students to take a break from studies and take advantage of the festival’s outstanding offerings.
Hundreds of publishers, booksellers, museums and theaters, as well as literacy and cultural organizations will be present all over campus on Trousdale Parkway, Alumni Park and McCarthy Quad to answer questions and promote L.A.’s cultural and artistic diversity. Some notable attendees will include Pasadena’s famed Vroman’s Bookstore, KCRW, Pelican Publishing Company, PBS SoCal and the Natural History Museum.
The festival will include nine outdoor stages spread throughout the campus, including the Los Angeles Times Stage, USC Stage, Reading by 9 Children’s Stage and Cooking Stage.
Food trucks will be located at Parking Structure 2 near Salvatori Hall. Children will have the opportunity to partake in arts and crafts along with storytelling time from well-known authors and speakers. For those interested in the arts, there will be live creation of street art, with hand-selected local artists from the Los Angeles Times “Inspire Us” Contest.
Similar to last year, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority is urging festival attendees to utilize public transportation when coming to USC to avoid parking issues and car congestion.
According to Metro statistics, more than 10 percent of festival attendees took the Metro to arrive at the event last year. Transportation options include the Metro Expo Line, the DASH F line and the Festival Shuttle Bus, which bring attendees to the front door of the event. Before or during the event, festival attendees can plan out their itineraries and learn more about the attending authors and the events to be held by visiting the festival’s mobile-friendly website.

The No. 2 USC women’s tennis team defeated No. 5 UCLA 4-3 on Thursday afternoon in Marks Stadium to finish an undefeated season and capture the Pac-12 regular season championship. USC has now won at least a share of the title in three of the past four seasons.
The Women of Troy split the title in 2012 with Stanford before winning it outright in 2013. This also serves as USC’s second undefeated Pac-12 season in the past three years.
The match was not always in USC’s favor, however. UCLA jumped out to a 1-0 lead after clinching the doubles point.
On the singles side of the action, things did not immediately pick up for the Women of Troy. Nearly two hours of grueling action would take place without a single match finishing, and even that did not go in USC’s favor, as the No. 1 player in the country, Robin Anderson, defeated USC’s No. 19 Sabrina Santamaria by a score of 3-6, 6-0, 7-5. The action was followed by another USC loss, as freshman Gabby Smith fell to her opponent, 6-4, 1-6, 6-2.  At this point in the match, USC was losing 0-3 and UCLA appeared to have a commanding lead.
The Women of Troy, however, had other plans.
Court three turned the tides for USC, as senior All-American Zoë Scandalis, ranked No. 61, dropped her opponent in the only two-set match of the day, 6-2, 7-6. The win for Scandalis came on the heels of her Tommy Award for Trojan Female Athlete of the Year.
The gap continued to close when freshman Meredith Xepoleas finished a come-from-behind win on court six by a score of 4-6, 7-5, 6-4.
From there, junior Guiliana Olmos tied it up with a 2-6, 7-5, 6-2 victory.
All eyes then turned to court four, where freshman Madison Westby and her UCLA counterpart Kyle McPhillips were duking it out. The match was close from the get go, with McPhillips taking the first set 7-5, followed by a Westby victory of 7-6 in the second set. Westby finally prevailed with a 6-4 win in the third set when McPhillips returned a shot long of the baseline.
The Women of Troy subsequently mobbed Westby and a celebration ensued. Unfortunately, in the mayhem the Pac-12 championship trophy was smashed, but not before the team was able to take photos capturing the moment.
Next up, the Women of Troy will prepare for their postseason run as they head to Ojai to compete in the Pac-12 tournament April 21 to 25.

With the excitement surrounding his debut studio album Adventure, French producer Hugo Pierre Leclercq, also known as Madeon, earned his 22-date North American tour this year.
Madeon’s most recent stop at the El Rey Theatre on April 15 showcased music from his new album, including all the fan favorites and top hits.
Madeon took the stage promptly at 10:15 p.m. after his opener The M Machine. The vibe of the theater was not very lively during the opening act’s performance, as its soft drops and slow beats weren’t enough to excite the crowd. The supporting act didn’t seem like much of a performance because the audience wasn’t involved with what was happening onstage. Awkward swaying and loud chatter filled the room as if background music was playing just to entertain the crowd. The lights onstage were so dim that the two DJs were barely visible, which just shows that their presentation was not much of a performance. After the duo played their last song, the audience cheered loudly, not to congratulate The M Machine, but in anticipation of seeing Madeon.
Chanting filled the venue as the audience yelled “Madeon! Madeon!” over and over until he came on stage. The atmosphere in the room changed dramatically, and everyone came to life, more than ready to see the main act. There was loud, non-stop cheering well before Madeon took the stage; the crowd even cheered for the tech guys that cleared off the set and prepped for the main act. After thinking that the excitement from the crowd couldn’t get any louder, the entire venue vibrated with applause and cheers the moment Madeon stepped into the spotlight. The artist opened his set with his most popular hit, “You’re On,” and immediately got the crowd involved by making them clap to the beat and jump up and down. The energy in the room was electrifying.
“The City” created a euphoric atmosphere as Madeon’s logo lit up in a larger-than-life-sized installation behind him. The audience shouted the lyrics with the music and enjoyed the incredibly beautiful light show at the back of the stage. Once “Pay No Mind” was mixed in his set, the stage lights changed from bright green hues to soft blue and purple to reflect his album cover.
The stage abruptly went silent at around 11:10 p.m., and the crowd was confused as to whether or not the set was over. Madeon’s worried face and nervous shuffling told the crowd that it wasn’t planned. The sound went out, and the performance had to be put on hold until the tech team was able to figure out what had happened. Madeon’s fans didn’t get upset in the slightest, however; instead, they cheered him on until the set was back on track. His name was yelled out repeatedly along with the words, “You can do it, it’s all right!” Some girls in the room started to suggest that Madeon sing, but this producer doesn’t sing, at least not that we know of. The artist grabbed the mic and apologized to the crowd for the inconvenience. After 15 minutes of silence, music finally blasted through the speakers and the show continued.
Madeon made a comeback with his song “Nonsense,” before quickly moving away from his DJ pad controllers and over to the keyboard. The lights dimmed while he played and sung a stripped-down version of “Home.” Every fan was shocked but extremely excited to learn that this producer could sing. It was a great recovery after having lost his sound just moments prior. After “Home,” Madeon ended his set in the same manner in which he started it — with “You’re On.” He took a bow and walked off stage, ending the Madeon “adventure.”

Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
In 2015, Clean Bandit began their nationwide tour featuring a show at the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles on April 15 for their debut studio album New Eyes.  Formed in 2009, the group consists of Grace Chatto, Neil Amin-Smith and brothers Jack Patterson and Luke Patterson. After DJ Ivy set the stage with a high-energy opening act, the band followed with an inspired and vivacious performance that drove their fans wild. 
 Opening with the upbeat Real Love, the band started the show off with a bang. The stage was aglow with lights and colors reflecting the warm and wicked-fun vibe of the group. Among songs performed were a few favorites from New Eyes, including the island-inspired “Come Over” with all its sensual summer glory and the ballad-inspired tunes “Nightingale” and “Cologne.” 
 The band gave their fans a most passionate show, full of different genre inspirations. Clean Bandit, unlike many other electronic bands, has revolutionized the genre by incorporating various other platforms of music like jazz, classical, hip-hop and even reggae. 
 The show also featured a menagerie of instruments, a factor that Chatto previously stated was a definitive aspect of the vision of the band. Aside from the driving and lilting electronic beats, Jack Patterson brought the house down on bass, keyboards and even saxophone. 
 Drummer Luke Patterson took the stage while the ethereal beauty Chatto danced to the beat of her own cello and vocals. Unfortunately, the group’s fourth member, violinist and pianist Amin-Smith, was unable to perform due to a hand injury. Thankfully, the group continued on with flying colors accompanied by wicked vocals from soulful acts like British singer Elisabeth Troy, who, along with Chatto and several other female artists, brought soul, classical and electronic music together. 
 The show ended in a flurry, but not without an encore of two of the group’s most popular songs. Their second to last number was a cover of singer-songwriter Robin S.’ track, “Show me Love.” The finale, however, was a performance of their most popular song yet, the one that won a 2015 Grammy award for Best Dance Recordings: “Rather Be.” Upbeat and funky, this track was the perfect ending to a successful and wonderfully performed show. 
 Despite the crazy beats, great vocals and lyrics, and the fact that we Americans just adore anything British, the show was truly defined by one thing. When The Daily Trojan spoke with Chatto for an interview, she had said that the group was striving for “a more intimate space of color and styling with electric content. We like to bring in bass guitars and electric guitars and piano so that its not just about a guy with a laptop and I hope this excites people about what we are.” 
 True to Chatto’s word, the band brought innovation to the table while looking like they were having the time of their lives. They were interactive and honest, speaking with an endearing directness to their fans, a feat many artists try and fail at accomplishing. 
 All in all, Clean Bandit proved that they not only have great potential in the rising world of EDM, but that they have also earned the love and dedication of fans who will follow them all the way to the top.

For the USC women’s water polo team, the last four weeks of the regular season couldn’t have gone any better.
After a win last Saturday against No. 8-ranked San Jose State, the Women of Troy now ride a seven-game winning streak into this Saturday’s marquee matchup against crosstown rival UCLA.
The No. 3-ranked Women of Troy (21-2, 4-1 MPSF) will suit up for what will be a clash between two of the nation’s best teams when they travel to Westwood to take on No. 2 UCLA (20-2, 4-1 MPSF) in their regular season finale.
The host Bruins are coming off a narrow 8-7 defeat at the hands of then-No. 2 Stanford in Palo Alto last weekend. The loss dropped UCLA out of the top spot in the national rankings and propelled Stanford to        No. 1, while USC has remained steady at the No. 3 spot since the beginning of the season.
Through 23 games this season, however, USC leads the MPSF in both offense and defense, scoring 17.57 goals per game and allowing just 4.43 goals per game. The Women of Troy have also outscored opponents by a whopping 404-102 margin.
For head coach Jovan Vavic, though, those stats won’t mean much at the end of the season if the Women of Troy don’t bring their A-game on Saturday.
“Against UCLA specifically, our defense has been good, but we’ve had problems scoring. In the last two games we’ve played them, our players only scored three goals, so we have to be more aggressive,” Vavic said. “That’s probably the one thing that has to be true for us to be successful against UCLA — we have to be more aggressive and more willing to take chances.”
The Women of Troy are looking to avenge a 5-3 loss to the Bruins in the UC Irvine Invitational back in late February.
Revenge and bragging rights, however, aren’t the only things on the line when these two teams meet, as this matchup will carry even greater implications than usual.
The match will be important for MPSF conference standings and possible tournament seedings, as the No. 2 seed in the upcoming MPSF tournament is on the line.
It will also be a tough test in the pool for USC in Westwood, as the Bruins are a perfect 5-0 at home. The Women of Troy, however, are looking to spoil the Bruins’ afternoon festivities when they visit Spieker Aquatics Center.
Senior two-meter Eike Daube thinks the high-pressure atmosphere will be a good test for the team.
“We have a really young team this year, and that loss earlier this season was the first time a majority of our girls played in the big rivalry game, so now we’re more prepared and excited to get another opportunity to play UCLA,” Daube said. “It’s also going to be UCLA’s Senior Day as well, so there will be a lot more people than we’re used to, but that just adds to the atmosphere of playing at such a high level, and it’s really exciting.”
Despite that loss to UCLA, the Women of Troy have been on a hot streak as of late, winning nine of their last 10 games and seven-in-a-row.
USC’s quest for a good tournament seed continued last weekend when the Women of Troy hosted San Jose State at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
It was a special day for USC’s seniors last Saturday, as Daube, Monica Vavic, Michelle Mercado, Sara Salamon and Jennifer Stiefel were all honored in a pregame ceremony before tipping off against the Spartans.
San Jose State came out of the gates hot and held close with a 4-2 score at the end of the first frame, but the Women of Troy turned up their defensive pressure and allowed just one goal in the second period.
The Women of Troy held a 10-3 lead at the half and ultimately outscored the Spartans 7-3 the rest of the way, ending with a 21-6 win on Senior Day.
Eleven different players scored against the Spartans, while seven goals were scored by seniors. Daube and Vavic led the way with three goals each, sophomore driver Stephania Haralabidis added a hat trick of her own and freshman goalie Victória Chamorro had nine saves in the cage.
That win, however, will pale in comparison to a USC victory on Saturday against the crosstown rivals.
“I think in order to win, we just need to focus on executing what we’ve been working on, and it’ll come down to people who you normally wouldn’t expect stepping up,” Daube said. “Because we have a very small senior class, UCLA is aware of who our top players are, but I think we can really make a difference with some of our younger girls, and I think they have something to prove.”
One of those younger players who is looking to make an impact will be Chamorro.
The Brazilian native won the starting spot after former Olympian and First Team All-American Flora Bolonyai graduated last year, and she has been steady in the cage all season long for the Women of Troy, averaging 6.78 saves per game and allowing only 4.34 goals per game.
Chamorro thinks her improvement over the course of the season both mentally and physically has helped her confidence heading into just her second time playing in the storied rivalry match.
“I believe I’ve improved a lot in the pool and out of it too, as a water polo player and as a person. The team and coaches have helped me a lot, and in the cage, I think I’ve been doing well for a freshman, so I’m excited,” Chamorro said. “I’m feeling really confident about this game, and I think our team has gotten much better since the beginning of the season, so we’re prepared to beat the Bruins. I think we can win this one.”
In the end, behind all the excitement and anticipation surrounding this Saturday’s rivalry match, Vavic believes that if the team can just stick together and follow its normal game plan, the Women of Troy will be fine.
“If our players are committed to the preparation, then what we do will all work out and we will be able to pull out a win,” Vavic said.
USC will head across town for the key matchup against the Bruins on April 18. The regular season finale for both teams will begin at 1 p.m. at UCLA’s Spieker Aquatics Center.

USC women’s lacrosse is heading into what is probably its biggest weekend of the season. Sitting at 6-0 in the MPSF conference and 10-3 overall — with their three losses coming to top-10 ranked opponents — the Women of Troy have a serious opportunity to run the table in the conference, with just three MPSF matchups remaining before the end of the regular season.
In order to accomplish the feat, however, the team will have to go through two Northern California opponents in UC Davis on Friday and Stanford on Sunday before a regular season finale with fellow SoCal dweller San Diego State next week.
The game against UC Davis should serve as an appetizer to the main course meal of Sunday’s Stanford matchup, as the Aggies enter Friday’s contest with just a 3-10 overall record and 2-3 conference record. The Aggies have won two of their last three conference matchups, however — an 11-6 victory over Fresno State and a 13-8 win over California — and will look to provide some resistance against a red-hot USC team on a mission for conference perfection.
UC Davis is led by two prolific attackers in senior Elizabeth Landry and sophomore Melissa Kellan. Together, Landry (36) and Kellan (26) have accounted for 62 of the Aggies’ 102 total goals this season and 79 of the team’s 129 points. Landry also leads the team with 64 draw controls on the season.
Senior defender Allie Lehner and junior midfielder Mary Doyle will also need to be held in check, as their strong numbers in hustle statistics indicate an ability to cause problems for USC. Lehner has 29 ground balls, 27 draw controls and 19 caused turnovers this season, while Doyle has 22 ground balls, 34 draw controls and 10 caused turnovers. In goal for the Aggies is senior Kai Murphy, who has made 95 saves this season while allowing 116 goals scored, a save percentage of .450.
Following Friday’s matchup, the Women of Troy will prepare for their biggest conference game of the season against No. 15 Stanford. The two teams currently sit atop the MPSF with undefeated records, meaning Sunday’s game could very well determine the winner of the conference.
The Cardinal enter the weekend at 5-0 in the MPSF and 9-2 overall. They will host the San Diego State Aztecs on Friday before their matchup with USC.
Stanford features a remarkably deep and balanced offensive attack. A pair of midfielders in junior Lucy Dikeou and senior Hannah Farr lead the Cardinal with 31 and 27 points, respectively, but the team has an impressive 10 players who have  double-digit points scored this season.
Stanford’s defense has been less formidable than its offense, surrendering an average of 10.27 goals per game. Freshman goalie Allie DaCar has made 49 saves while allowing 93 goals, a save percentage of .345.
The Cardinal’s defensive numbers suggest that there should be some healthy opportunities for USC to put goals home. Leading the offense for the Women of Troy will be sophomore Michaela Michael and juniors Caroline de Lyra and Amanda Johansen.
Michael was just named the MPSF Offensive Player of the Week and the Epoch/Lacrosse Magazine’s National Player of the Week after scoring nine goals, winning 11 draw controls, picking up four ground balls, dishing two assists and causing a turnover as the Women of Troy defeated Colorado 12-9 on April 10 and Denver 16-4 on April 12.
Michael leads the team with 39 goals this season and sits in second place in total points scored thanks to her eight assists. She has also tallied a remarkable 80 draw control wins.
Ahead of Michael in points scored is de Lyra, who has tallied 54 points on an even-split of 27 goals and 27 assists. Johansen resides in third place on the team points list, with 39 points from 31 goals and eight assists. Johansen has also tallied 18 ground balls, 41 draw controls and 15 caused turnovers this year.
Defensively, the Women of Troy will be led by three every-game starters in sophomore Nina Kelty, junior Courtney Tarleton and senior Kaitlyn Couture. Anchoring the defense will be freshman goalkeeper Gussie Johns, who has allowed 93 goals while making 51 saves this season, a percentage of .354.
The Women of Troy are looking to finish the season with an undefeated conference record in just their third year as a program.
Though one regular season contest will remain against San Diego State on April 25, the upcoming weekend matchups in Northern California are as critical a set of games as the team has had all season.
Friday’s game with UC Davis kicks off at 4 p.m. Sunday’s clash with Stanford is set to begin at 3 p.m. and will be covered by the Pac-12 Networks.

Every sunny spring here at USC brings high expectations and hype for the upcoming football season. It seems as if, year after year, the Trojans are projected to compete for the national championship several months before the season has even started. Back in 2012, the Trojans were preseason No. 1, and several experts picked them to win the championship. Well, we all know how that turned out.
This year feels different, however. The Trojans have brought in the best recruiting class since the Pete Carroll era, returned one of the best quarterbacks in the country in Cody Kessler and have tremendous talent on both sides of the ball.
Coming into spring practice, the Trojans were faced with numerous question marks. Their best player, Leonard Williams, was leaving for the NFL Draft, as was leading wide receiver Nelson Agholor.
Off-the-field issues for Bryce Dixon left the tight end position up for grabs, and many wondered whether an offensive line that gave up numerous sacks last season would grow.
On the offensive side of the ball, sophomore JuJu Smith and redshirt sophomore Steven Mitchell had tremendous spring seasons. Smith, coming off an impressive freshman campaign in which he caught 54 passes for 724 yards and five touchdowns, has slowly become one of Kessler’s favorite targets. After dealing with nagging injuries in his first two seasons, Mitchell came alive during spring practice and fought for the No. 2 spot behind Smith.
For the first time in almost a decade, the defense resembles a Carroll-era stalwart. Led by junior Su’a Cravens and sophomore wonder Adoree’ Jackson, the Trojans field one of the best secondaries in the country. Freshman Iman Marshall expects to factor into the rotation as well. Redshirt senior Antwaun Woods will start at nose tackle for the Trojans, hoping to replicate some of the success that Williams had over the past three years.
After dealing with the effects of reduced scholarships for the past four years, head coach Steve Sarkisian will finally have some depth to his team. The years of traveling with half a team and practicing without contact because of fear of injury are over. With a recruiting class of 19 players, the Trojans are set to be three-deep at every position with scholarship players, a first in almost four years.
Though the Trojans will be much deeper this season, their success will depend on the play of Kessler. He put up phenomenal numbers last season, completing 69 percent of his passes en route to 39 touchdown passes, tying a school record. If the Trojans want to make the jump to elite, however, they will need Kessler to perform better in games against top opponents. Against unranked opponents last year, Kessler threw for 2,434 yards and 32 touchdowns. Meanwhile, he threw for just 1,392 yards and seven touchdowns against ranked opponents, a clear step backward.
With another starting season and spring under his belt, Kessler figures to continue his growth as the next great USC quarterback. Though he won’t have the same weapons as Matt Barkley did in Marqise Lee and Robert Woods, Kessler will be the main benefactor of Sarkisian’s up-tempo offense. If Kessler is able to lead the Trojans to a strong season, expect his name to be in the Heisman conversation.
One key weakness that the Trojans will have to overcome is their lack of seniority. The Trojans return only six senior starters for this upcoming season, but players like Jackson, Cravens and Smith have all taken leadership roles in their underclassman years. The Trojans will have to hope that the incoming freshman class                                        can  follow suit.
Heightened expectations put more pressure on Sarkisian, as he takes the reins for his second year in charge. The Trojans started 2014 well before falling apart in losses to Utah, Arizona State and UCLA. The Trojans ended the season on a high note, though, winning the Holiday Bowl over Nebraska. With Sarkisian landing the top recruiting class in the country, however, finishing 9-4, or even 10-3, next season is not going to keep Trojan fans happy. Should the Trojans be out of the playoff race come late November, Sarkisian might find himself looking for another job.
Sarkisian is doing his best Carroll impression, opening practices to the media, praising players publicly and opening the offense up. Now it’s time to see if he can replicate the results.
The Trojans’ season doesn’t kick off for another five months, on     Sept. 5 against Arkansas State. This team is by far the most well-rounded that USC has fielded in years, combining the right amount of leadership and youth. A lot can happen in those five months, but for now the sky is the limit for this young but talented team.

You forgot the early enrollees. The 2015 class is 25 players plus 1 blueshirt.

The USC baseball team continues its quest of a Pac-12 title this weekend at Dedeaux Field against the Oregon Ducks. The Trojans (27-9, 8-4 Pac-12) rebounded to beat the Pepperdine Waves on the road Tuesday after a tough weekend series against UCLA.
USC and Pepperdine battled through a 12-inning contest, with the Trojans eventually coming out on top, 2-0. In an effort to get back on track after a rough start to the season, junior reliever Kyle Davis was given the start on Tuesday and threw two scoreless innings.
Sophomore Bernardo Flores replaced Davis in the bottom of the third inning and struck out six in four scoreless innings of his own.
Juniors Tyler Gilbert and Marc Huberman combined for the last six innings of the game, holding the Waves scoreless.
Offensively, the Trojans gave themselves plenty of opportunities but stranded baserunners in nine of the 12 innings. USC finally broke through in the top of the 12th, however.
Freshman Adalberto Carrillo led off the inning with a double and advanced to third base on a bunt by redshirt sophomore Reggie Southall.
Redshirt junior Bobby Stahel, who extended his hitting streak to 18 games earlier in the contest, then loaded the bases on catcher’s interference.
After two quick outs, junior Timmy Robinson came through in the clutch with a single to left field to score two go-ahead runs.
Head coach Dan Hubbs, who has been talking about the resiliency of his team all season, said that Tuesday’s win was yet another testament to the team’s toughness.
“The one thing that makes this team different is that they can overcome some adversity. We had to overcome losing three out of four last week,” Hubbs said. “We didn’t swing the bats well [against Pepperdine] but, you know, we got 12 scoreless on the mound. Sometimes you just have to win that way. We’ve been fortunate to have been able to find a bunch of different ways to win, and Tuesday was no exception.”
This weekend, the Trojans will come back home to host a surging Ducks team (21-16, 4-8 Pac-12) that has won four of its last five games after a shaky start to the season.
Oregon’s offense has come together well of late, scoring 31 runs in the past five games alone. Hubbs explained that the key to the Trojans’ success this weekend will be to force Oregon out of its comfort zone at the plate.
“If we can start off on Friday by putting up some zeroes and finding ways to score some runs and put them behind the eight ball, I think that’ll cause them to play a little different,” Hubbs said. “The way they like to play is they like to have action and have the leadoff guy on and maybe bunt him up, play for a run and hope you screw up a bunt or something, and hope it leads to a big inning.”
Even though the Trojan offense has been slightly diminished recently, it still poses a big threat on any given day, with a .298 overall team batting average.
Hubbs said the team’s offense simply needs to focus on putting pressure on the Ducks’ defense instead of trying to do too much at the plate.
“Oregon has made a lot of errors the last couple weeks, so we need to force them to have to make plays,” Hubbs said. “We can’t give them high fly balls and strikeouts, where they don’t have to make plays. If we do that and put a lot of pressure on them, I think we’ll have a chance to score a lot of runs.”
At the moment, USC sits in third place in the Pac-12 standings, even while holding the No. 10 overall ranking in the country.
The UCLA Bruins (26-7, 12-3 Pac-12) lead the conference, followed by Arizona State        (23-10, 11-4 Pac-12), but with eight conference wins and four losses, the Trojans only sit one game behind the Bruins in the loss column.
“Let’s say we have a big weekend and win two out of three, and UCLA loses two out of three. Then, all of a sudden, you’re tied at the top, depending on what Arizona State does,” Hubbs said. “Just because we lost the series to UCLA doesn’t mean we don’t have a shot to win the conference. We still have some big series ahead of us, and we can’t take anything for granted. If we continue to play well, all the goals [the team] has set and all the things we would like to happen are going to happen.”

Diversity in the media is a widely discussed topic these days; just as the face of America is changing, the faces we see on television and in movies are slowly changing as well. That adjustment is slow, and even now we see a surprising lack of diversity coming out of Hollywood, despite the fact that Latinos make up almost half of Los Angeles’ population. But according to some students, USC’s master of fine arts acting program is ahead of the game in representing America’s new generation.
“There’s a line in this Superman film, ‘I was born in Kansas — it doesn’t get more American than that,’” said Christopher Ramirez, a second-year actor in the M.F.A. program. “And you know, I’m all-American, yet people wouldn’t think of that by looking at me.”
Ramirez, who grew up in Kansas City, started acting just over three years ago. “The USC M.F.A program is the best because they teach you to be who you are. It’s not about breaking you down and building you up. There’s not an M.F.A. program in the United States that has so many Latino actors in it,” claimed Ramirez.
Gabriella Garcia, also a second-year actor in the M.F.A. program, discussed the ups and downs of breaking into the industry, and the particular challenges Latino actors face, with Ramirez.
“We want good stories. That’s what any actor wants — they want something that’s going to stretch them, something they can relate to. They don’t want to be what people perceive them to be,” Ramirez said.
Garcia, who was raised in Lancaster, California, moved to Los Angeles during high school to pursue acting and attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy for her B.F.A.
“Growing up, my idols were Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, Audrey Hepburn. … Those movies have always really related to me, but you don’t see Latina actresses in those kinds of movies at all. Those are the kinds of movies that my soul really connects to. It’s less of a stretch for me to do that than some stereotypical Latin thing.”
Typecasting is a common problem for Latino actors, who find themselves placed again and again in the same stereotypical roles. Ramirez and Garcia, however, aren’t discouraged. Garcia shared her experience of being typecasted into what she called “chola” roles.
“It’s a double-edged sword because my job is to play something truthfully, and for someone on this planet, that’s their story. But when it happens over and over and you see talented actors missing opportunities, that’s when it becomes frustrating,” Garcia said.
According to Ramirez, typecasting doesn’t necessarily need to result in a negative experience. He talked about a recent documentary in which he played the role of a Latino MC.
“I just happened to fit how he kind of looked,” Ramirez said. “It was a tragic story because he had so much talent, but he was phased by the environment he grew up in and the pressure that was on him. He ends up finding his way to drugs and he blew his talent, but the world was on his shoulders, and that’s why I related to him — because he had a point of view, he had something to say.”
Ramirez and Garcia agree on the importance of the acting community in shaping mentalities.
“We can’t cast judgements upon our characters because we have to live truthfully under those imaginary circumstances. I think the actor has to have a really open mentality and perspective of the world we live in,” said Garcia.
“Unfortunately, the business we work in, they don’t see the same openness we do,” added Ramirez.
Within the M.F.A. program, though, Ramirez and Garcia feel that they’re being given the roles they deserve.
“That’s what’s special about the M.F.A. acting program. No matter how diverse the individual ensemble is, that isn’t going to steer them away from material that doesn’t fit their physical appearances,” said Garcia. “They’re going to take each individual ensemble, and they’ll pick what’s going to challenge them. Last semester we worked on Sam Shepard, and it’s typically portrayed with an all-American, Southwestern, all-Caucasian cast, but our group is Shepard. It’s totally all-American. We’re the contemporary all-American.”

Stephen King’s sprawling fantasy saga The Dark Tower has been languishing in development hell for the better part of a decade now, passed along from studio to studio like a cursed object from one of the author’s myriad horror novels, leaving nothing but bloated budgets and devastated dreams in its wake. Last week, however, Sony Pictures announced its intention to finally bring King’s self-described magnum opus to life onscreen.
Sony, along with its producing partner Media Rights Capital, hopes to turn the eight-book series, which has sold a combined 30 million copies worldwide since the first installment hit shelves in 1982, into a multimedia franchise that will encompass both theatrical releases and a high-end television show similar in tone and scale to HBO’s Game of Thrones. Sony will be working alongside producer Brian Grazer and USC alumnus Ron Howard, both of whom have been attached to the project for years, and screenwriters Akiva Goldsman and Jeff Pinkner, whose 2010 draft received praise from King himself. No announcements have been made regarding a director or potential cast members, but the Internet is already ablaze with conjecture.
The announcement represents the possible culmination of decades of waiting for fans of the series, a genre-bending epic that follows Roland Deschain, the last surviving member of an order of knights known as gunslingers, and his quest for the eponymous Dark Tower, a fabled structure said to serve as the supernatural linchpin of time and space. King drew on a variety of sources, including Arthurian legend, the Wagnerian extravaganzas of J.R.R. Tolkien and the blood-spattered spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, in order to create Mid-World, an alternate dimension resembling a magic-infused Old West. In the increasingly meta later novels, Roland’s story effectively became the nexus of King’s literary multiverse, bringing in dozens of characters and settings from his other books. The author himself even pops up as a character in Song of Susannah, the sixth part of the saga.
So what actors would be most well-suited to populate King’s world of macabre mysticism? One of the previous attempts to adapt the series actually had a few solid ideas. After another movie/TV combo deal involving Universal and J.J. Abrams fell through in 2011, Howard, who was then planning to direct the film adaptation himself, began shopping the property to Warner Bros. and HBO. Javier Bardem was at one point nearly cast as the noble, stoic Roland, and Breaking Bad actor Aaron Paul was rumored to be circling the role of Eddie Dean, a quick-witted heroin junkie-turned-gunslinger who joins Roland’s ka-tet, or band of adventurers. Eventually Bardem lost interest, however, and the studio began courting Russell Crowe instead, who remained attached until Warner Bros. pulled its support in the fall of 2012.
If he could be lured back to the project, Bardem has the makings of an excellent Roland. Even though he’s been largely typecast as villains in his English-speaking roles thanks to memorably menacing turns as the monstrous assassin Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men and the vengeful ex-spy Silva in Skyfall, the Spanish actor is an incredibly soulful performer who could easily convey the character’s world-weary grace. Crowe would have been an inspired choice around his Gladiator heyday, but he’s arguably aged out of the part by now.
Paul, who has struggled to find another meaningful role since the end of Breaking Bad, would likewise make for a worthy Eddie, but the actor has reportedly sworn off playing drug addicts, at least for the time being. Eddie is essentially a super-powered Jesse Pinkman, so perhaps that casting idea was too on-the-nose anyway. Ben Foster, the twitchy character actor best known for enlivening Lone Survivor and the 3:10 to Yuma remake, would certainly do in a pinch. 12 Years A Slave star Lupita Nyong’o would be the ideal pick to pull off Susannah, Eddie’s troubled wife, who suffers from dissociative identity disorder.
What about the villains, you ask? The Dark Tower series is chock full of memorable heavies, including a genocidal would-be god known as the Crimson King — something tells me King must be a big progressive rock fan — and his diabolical emissary Randall Flagg, better known by his Johnny Cash-approved moniker The Man in Black. The Crimson King could be played by any of the usual envoys of stately dread — Malcolm McDowell, Ian McDiarmid and Jeremy Irons all spring to mind — but the casting of Flagg is another matter entirely.
A silver-tongued sorcerer who also appears in the non-Dark Tower novels The Stand and Eyes of the Dragon, Flagg is often described as the ultimate embodiment of evil in King’s fiction, a chaotic force of nature hell-bent on bringing down entire civilizations by sowing the seeds of discord and fanaticism with an easy smile and a folksy attitude. Matthew McConaughey is rumored to be playing Flagg in the upcoming big screen version of The Stand, so it would only make sense to have him reprise the role in the Dark Tower movies. He certainly possesses the requisite combination of charisma and intensity, and as anyone who’s seen True Detective or the underrated gem Frailty can tell you, he can definitely play unhinged. Alternatives might include Christian Bale, Guy Pearce or Viggo Mortensen.
If the film and television adaptations are undertaken simultaneously, The Dark Tower could prove to be a truly groundbreaking work of multimedia storytelling, one with the potential to finally bridge the gap between cinematic spectacle and the character-driven virtues of television’s long-form narrative model. Sony and its partners seem ready, willing and able to assume the risk. If they’re able to attract a great director such as Guillermo del Toro, Frank Darabont or Alejandro Jodorowsky to act as a guiding light for the franchise, so much the better. In the end, though, it will be up to audiences to decide whether or not to make the climb.

Recently, a slew of pro-life and anti-abortion policies have been making substantial gains at the state level. Earlier this month, Kansas signed into law a measure that bans the most common form of second trimester abortion procedures, and Oklahoma followed closely behind with a measure approved by its state senate by a vote of 37-4. Arkansas leads the anti-abortion trend with six new anti-abortion laws this year alone, and Indiana’s feticide law continues to produce rulings mired in controversy, causing pro-choice supporters to bite their lips in panic as their essential viewpoints on human rights are dwarfed in the political realm.
As a landmark ruling and point of pride for pro-choice activists, Roe v. Wade officially legalized a woman’s decision to have an abortion in 1973 and limited state regulation to the third trimester of pregnancy. Despite the black-and-white ruling, plenty of states have found loopholes to oppose the law and make abortion infeasible and inaccessible for women who want to terminate their pregnancies. For example, Kansas’ and Oklahoma’s recent second-trimester abortion restrictions villainize the safest abortion procedure for women in their second trimester by labeling the use of forceps, clamps, knives or similar instruments to remove the fetus from the womb “dismemberment abortion.” The second safest method, which is abortion via induced labor, implies greater health risks for women due to the higher rates of uterine rupture, hemorrhaging and longer induction time. No matter how many anti-choice measures are passed, it does not change the fact that women sometimes choose to abort their pregnancies. It becomes a major issue when state legislatures pass policies that limit the ways in which women can safely pursue an abortion and instead put women at risk when they are forced to endure more dangerous procedures.
Opponents to the new measures, such as Planned Parenthood, have criticized the laws’ use of and non-medical language to “to insert politics into personal medical decisions.” By presenting the dilation and extraction (D&E) abortion procedure as a gruesome practice that desecrates a living fetus, supporters of the policy have merely focused on the graphic details of the operation to appeal to conservative policymakers. In reality, most abortions occur during the first trimester of pregnancy, and the number of D&E abortions adds up to around 5 percent of the estimated total count in Oklahoma. Women who do choose to have second trimester abortions are usually younger, less educated, afraid and have recently experienced hardships or disruptive events. Women who decide to get second trimester abortions need all the options they can get and can’t afford to be blocked from procedures like dilation and evacuation.
It is true that the surgical process of dilation and extraction is the same as many types of medical procedures. Politicians should leave it to the physicians to perform surgeries and advise women on their medical decisions. Interference by politicians is undoubtedly a damaging blow for women, considering that D&E abortions are the most compassionate toward the women involved and warrant the lowest costs of all second trimester abortion methods. Compared to the partial birth abortion ban of 2003, which pertained to a procedure that involves partially delivering a live fetus with the intention of terminating it, D&E abortions are much less morally questionable and relevant to more women. To quell anti-choice concerns about operating on a live fetus, physicians can inject a fetal heart with heart-stopping medication using a needle guided by an ultrasound, and, most scientists agree that fetal pain is unlikely to be present before 27 weeks into the pregnancy.
According to pro-choice supporters, the second trimester ban is vulnerable to lawsuits because it renders abortions inaccessible before the fetus can survive outside of the womb with assistance, which is during the third trimester. Oklahoma’s and Kansas’ new laws are blatantly taking an underhanded route to get around Roe v. Wade and limiting the ways in which already struggling women can handle unplanned pregnancies and receive medical assistance. When the government begins to set up barriers and essentially force women to remain pregnant, a problem of basic human rights emerges as the ability of individuals to make their own medical decisions is impeded upon.
Contrary to the concerns of anti-choice supporters, these new laws do nothing to promote pregnancy and safe sex. Instead, they create a platform for a nationwide effort to criminalize abortion and the women who have already made a difficult decision under the pretense of protecting fetal life.
The moment you ask taxpayers to pick up the tab, you have injected politics into an issue. If medical freedom with privacy is the goal, one cannot expect someone else to pick up the tab. It is only by limiting the involvement of taxpayer dollars that we can restore privacy and freedom to health care.

As Trojans, we strive to be the best. USC is universally known as a world-renowned research institution, but in one area it has fallen behind. While universities like Stanford and the UC system have made major investments in solar energy, USC has yet to take action. In 2010, the USC Board of Trustees approved a campus sustainability resolution calling for “an active energy conservation program,” including “…maximiz[ing] the purchase of electric energy from renewable resources.”
Despite this commitment, a current budget of $3.9 billion and 292 sunny days per year, solar panels are nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, Occidental, another private college located in L.A., has installed solar despite having fewer financial resources. In 2014, the UC system made the largest commitment to solar of any educational institution in the country despite major budget cuts. Multiple California State University campuses and community colleges in the Los Angeles Community College District have also taken this important step. This shows that all USC is lacking is the will to take action.
Were USC to install solar panels, it would only take about .005 percent of USC’s budget to produce 10 percent of our energy from them. Even this upfront cost can be reduced by a number of programs, such as solar leases. Solar leasing would allow for immediate benefits. With leasing, the panels are installed for essentially no upfront cost and USC pays a reduced rate for the electricity produced. This would reduce our annual carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 30 million pounds per year. With climate change continuing unabated, the time for action is now.
This action would signal that USC is ready to make our campus sustainable, something that is long overdue. Solar energy would reduce our impact on the environment and show that we are serious about our commitments as a university. It is time for USC to begin leading in sustainability rather than falling behind. There are challenges that need to be overcome, but as Trojans we should not look at a challenge and leave it to someone else to solve.
We, the Environmental Affairs Organization, have been working with USC administration and solar professionals to craft a business proposal that would allow the school to install solar with minimal cost. This plan will soon be ready, and we are entering a crucial stage of our campaign where we prepare to present these plans to USC’s leadership. We are building support among all parts of the USC community to make upper administration take us seriously.
Student support for solar is absolutely essential for this campaign to be successful. Only when the USC community unites around this issue can we create the will for action. We need your support to make this happen! It’s as easy as liking our Facebook page (USC Go Solar Campaign) and signing our petition. If you want to get more involved, please attend our meetings on Thursdays at 5 p.m. in VKC 211 and help us to move forward together. Fight on and go solar!

I’ll never forget seeing a picture of President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, bending over at the waist, while a 5-year-old black boy reached up to touch Obama’s hair because the kid wanted to see if it felt like his. The image conveys a product of years of struggle for civil rights by people of color, from Harriet Tubman to Martin Luther King, Jr., and also serves as an inspirational icon for the progress yet to be made by people of different races, sexual orientations and genders.
Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy for president of the United States on Sunday, and the dialogue since has gone back and forth between those whose reasons for supporting her include pride in the fact that she’s a woman and those who would rather just talk about her qualifications. As a headline for The Guardian put it, “A female president? Nice, but not why I want Hillary Clinton.”
The “let’s only talk about qualifications” discussion is unsettling and symptomatic of some lingering assumptions about the glass ceiling, even if it isn’t meant to be. Some folks worry that people are more likely to support Hillary just because she’s a woman and in doing so, not select the best candidate for the presidency. That worry is misguided, and anyone familiar with Sarah Palin’s brief moment in the nation’s spotlight can see why.
By any stretch of the phrase, Hillary Clinton is the most qualified candidate for president. Three decades of experience, from her eight years as first lady, to her tenure as a senator, to her most recent work as secretary of state, make her about as ready for the job as they come. She carries a message of opportunity for the middle class, one desperately needed as income inequality rises. Beyond our nation’s border, she is a more reserved type of interventionist, with the cohesive and strategic worldview required to deal with a world more unstable than at any point since the Cold War (and arguably before). Clinton has also ended the Democratic primary phase before it begins and is virtually guaranteed the nomination, an unprecedented feat in modern political history that hasn’t occurred since Martin Van Buren’s landslide primary victory in 1835.
But disregarding Clinton’s identity as a woman is bothersome, and so is the notion that there is an army of Hillary supporters who are only going to vote for her because of her gender identity. Eighty-three percent of people in a Bloomberg poll said Hillary being a woman “doesn’t matter much” to them in deciding who to vote for. The tendency of Hillary’s detractors to assume her supporters are only doing so because she is a woman might reveal more about the state of gender equality than we’re comfortable hearing.
But the 12 percent of people who said Clinton’s womanhood makes them “more inclined to vote for her” do not deserve the flack they are getting. Those 12 percent of people who recognize that our nation’s storied trend of electing 43 consecutive dudes to lead the free world might be a little strange are right to feel the way they do, and those who think that Clinton’s gender shouldn’t matter at all have a misguided fear. Find me a single Republican voter who will say, “Gee, I disagree with Hilary on social issues and economic policy, but she’s a woman, so here goes,” and I’ll eat the newspaper this column is printed on.
The point everyone also seems to miss is that Clinton’s gender doesn’t just give her the potential to make history in an incredibly important way — it also gives her a remarkable sense of perspective on issues important to women everywhere. Gender does not give her an intrinsically higher value, it gives her an intrinsically better perspective on certain issues because of lived experience. In the same way that a former governor can tout experience leading a particular state as helpful for leading the nation, a woman — who has experienced discrimination that most men are unfamiliar with — can certainly make a more compelling and powerful case for women’s issues on the political stage.
Another, albeit less common, argument that gets tossed around is that the barriers women face have been lowered to the point where Clinton’s womanhood shouldn’t matter. Women still earn 78 cents for every dollar a man earns for the same work, and Republicans in Congress routinely block legislation like the Paycheck Fairness Act, all the while advocating for greater restrictions on abortion and access to birth control. The Economist’s “Glass Ceiling Index,” which ran last month on International Women’s Day and ranks countries according to women’s chances of being treated equally at work, puts the United States out of the top 20 in most rankings, depending on how you weigh factors like wages, higher education and costs of childcare, among other things. This country still doesn’t have paid maternity leave, something nearly all industrialized economies offer. On all of those issues and more, I can’t think of a better advocate than Hillary Clinton, in part because of her perspective and experience as a woman.
There has been some division in the feminist community over Clinton’s so-called “corporate feminism,” that is, her persistent advocacy for abortion and birth control rights while also serving on the board of companies like Walmart, which underpays workers (a majority of whom are women), and helping many American businesses like Boeing and Lockheed Martin make lucrative overseas contracts while secretary of state. It’s complicated, but the value judgement we should all make is that any form of feminism is better than no form at all. The fact is, as long as documented structural discrimination against women exists, and even after it’s gone, Emma Watson is right. We should all be feminists.

Time for a non tolkenistic president.
It’s not about the Money — but the EMPIRE behind the money!
The really pivotal issue (of all ‘issues’) is whether Hillary (or
any one of these neocon ‘R’ Vichy political puppet candidates,
and neoliberal-con ‘D’ Vichy political puppet candidates) will do
anything about the Empire which is the cancerous CAUSE of all these
‘identity issues’, ‘symptom problems’, and our entire “ailing
social order” —- all of which is CAUSED by only one central,
seminal, singular, but ‘disguised’ EMPIRE (the Cancer of all
Maladies) in our dying body politic.
 The answer, of course, is NO —- Hillary will not even whisper a
word about the Disguised Global Capitalist Empire that she is
auditioning in front of, and ‘for which she will front’ if (s)elected
as the next faux/Emperor/Empress/president of this Disguised Global
Capitalist Empire’s nominal world HQ in the belly of what most
deluded and propagandized citizen/’subjects’ wishfully call ‘their
country’.
As Zygmunt Bauman hauntingly puts it, “In the case of an ailing
social order, the absence of an adequate diagnosis…is a crucial,
perhaps decisive, part of the disease.”13
 Berman, Morris (2011-02-07). Dark Ages America: The Final Phase of
Empire (p. 22). Norton. Kindle Edition.
Today and HERE, the disease is Empire, and the cure is public
‘exposure’.
Perhaps, the non-violent step beyond “Occupy” is not
just “Occupy the Empire” as I had thought and worked toward
for many years, but is a mass civil ‘action’ of public exposure with
signs reading “Expose the Empire”.

One’s gender is not a qualification for the presidency. Unfortunately, the long march of more female politicians has not been accompanied by better policies or less corruption or increased economic freedom or increased personal freedoms. The 20 years of having (2) two female senators in California has resulted in the reduction of wages through increased taxation (less economic freedom) and increased government surveillance and more intrusive searches of travelers (less personal freedom). 
One can draw the conclusion that a Hillary Clinton presidency will mean the loss of more freedoms. Her promise to become a champion for the middle class and getting rid of unaccountable money in politics will likely result in more government invasions in ones personal and financial affairs. It is impossible for governments to know if the middle class is doing “better” unless those same governments know intimate details on ones life, both before enacting policies and after enacting policies. It is impossible for governments to know if donations to political causes are “accountable” unless the governments have detailed financial records. Both of these new government examinations mean the loss of privacy. I have yet to find where the loss of privacy is to the advantage of an individual. 
I have yet to find that having governments pay for benefits that are the responsibility of individuals that the costs per transaction are reduced. Simply put, the more governments are involved, the higher the prices become. One example is health care – since the passing of the first HMO act, health care costs have increased. Since the consolidation of student loans through federal law, prices for education have gone up. There are too many examples to count.
I agree with Liberty Minded….. Another issue is that folks shouldn’t make the same mistake a 3rd time by voting for someone because they’re perceived to be black or is a woman. You vote because you think the person of your choice has the skills and qualifications to be president or a leader of the group. Voting for someone because of their gender or race is absolutely wrong and goes completely against anything the civil rights leadership strived for 50 years ago. You are to vote based on the candidates content of their character, and we all know that Hillary Clinton does not have any “content of character”, as she has proven over her political lifetime and even before when she was a lawyer, that she cannot be trusted and is a pathological liar, like her ex boss. She will end up pulling out of the race once the Benghazi issue is finished and the email scandal, the destruction of government property, has been through the courts. She is a potential felon and has proven that she does not have the best interest of the country, of Americans, of the middle calls at heart. She has her own self interests at heart…. She has proven that over and over again….. keep your eyes and minds open and you will see.  Besides, do you want Bill back in the White House, hiding in closets with female interns and embarrassing the country, again?
