It began with a post on the USC Climbing Team Facebook group. Two months later they were filming for the reality show Team Ninja Warrior: College Madness. 
Antonio Ayala, Noelle Crowley and Julian Olea, all members of the Climbing Team at USC, spent a weekend in August competing for the show, which is set to air Nov. 22 on the Esquire Network.
Though the contestants could not disclose specifics of the obstacle course, Crowley, a junior majoring in environmental studies, described the competition as a relay with two identical obstacle courses for each team consisting of ropes, nets and bar obstacles. According to Olea, a junior majoring in biological sciences, each run took three to four minutes.
Contestants filled out an application online in order to be on the show and sent videos of themselves working out and climbing. Crowley said she “didn’t feel as confident” when she sent in the first half of her application, but was gratified when the show’s producers called her and urged her to submit her application as soon as possible.
“The producers called and personally asked me to be on the show,” Crowley said. “What an incredible opportunity, and I was being personally invited to do it.”
Since the contestants had only a month to train before filming for the competition began, Crowley said she continued climbing as normal, while Olea said he worked out for 15 to 20 hours a week and “tailored his workouts to endurance ones.”
Along with working out on their own, the USC contestants practiced once on an American Ninja Warrior imitation obstacle course owned by Arnold Hernandez, a former contestant on the show.
“It was super cool to be able to test out similar type of obstacles before the show,” Crowley said. “They were challenging, but I’m glad I got to practice there and get some tips from [Hernandez] before we filmed.”
After practicing, the team faced UCLA in late August. Ayala, a sophomore majoring in psychology and journalism, said the schools’ rivalry added to the pressure. 
“It was a lot of fun to face UCLA,” Ayala said. “We got to know the UCLA team, and they were some really cool people. We were competitive but friendly, and we bantered back and forth.”
Having the show recorded in Los Angeles added to the USC vs. UCLA pressure; however, Olea said that USC had more people supporting them during filming.
“It was super awesome because we had a lot of USC people coming out to support us in the crowd,” Olea said.
Ayala described the competition as grueling, due to the people rooting them on and the added pressure of being on television, but ultimately enjoyed being on the show.
“It was tiring and stressful to have to do the best we could, but it was truly a great experience,” Ayala said. “The people were my favorite part. Everyone was so open and happy to be there, so we all clicked and had a great time just being there.”
Crowley was proud to serve as a role model for women and was excited for the opportunity to show young women what they are capable of achieving.
“It’s really cool to be a strong inspiration for young women,” Crowley said. “I always hear that girls can’t do pullups, but no, girls can do pullups and have a lot of upper body strength.”
Jona Siegel, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering who has been watching American Ninja Warrior for four years, said that this new edition is “very exciting.”
“I enjoy watching what people can do in American Ninja Warrior, and it’s really cool they’re doing a collegiate version of it,” Siegel said. “It will be nice to root on the Trojans.”
Though the actual competition was filmed two months ago, Crowley said she plans to have a watch party with her group of friends and Olea said he still gets excited thinking about seeing himself on TV.
“The more I think about it, I get super psyched knowing that it’s coming up,” Olea said.

Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanTalk it out · Trojan British Parlimentary Debate Team members Noha Ayoub and Rebecca Hu participated in the debate on Monday evening.
The Political Student Assembly and the Trojan British Parliamentary Debate Team sponsored a debate Monday evening regarding whether “safe spaces” are detrimental or beneficial to college education.
Four members of the Trojan British Parliamentary Debate Team debated the issue at the PSA meeting, bringing up social issues like sexual assault on college campuses, the Black Lives Matter movement, the purpose of college education and marginalized groups in society. Following the half-hour debate, the team opened up the discussion to audience members and answered questions from Political Student Assembly members. 
PSA Assistant Director Maddy Taras said that she was pleased with the event and emphasized the importance of the issue. 
“I think it’s really important that students are aware of both sides to any controversial topic and any topic in general, so it was really great that some of the panelists agreed with their position and some of them didn’t agree with their position,” Taras said. “I think it’s really healthy discourse for people to hear both sides to any argument.”
Noha Ayoub, one of the debaters, said that the purpose of the event was to demonstrate how the debate team discusses controversial issues related to the college experience. 
“PSA invited the British Parliamentary Debate Team to come and demonstrate what we do on a more controversial issue relating to the college experience,” Ayoub said. “We talked about safe spaces because it’s one of the most important things people are talking about right now with regards to the purpose of the college experience.”
According to Ayoub, the team, which is finishing up its fifth year, is one of few places on campus where students are encouraged to express their opinions freely with others who may not feel the same way. 
“It’s one of the few places on campus where you’re allowed to engage with other people who disagree with you in a way that’s meaningful,” Ayoub said. “Even when we do talk about controversial issues in which people disagree, we’re able to do it in a way that’s less name-calling and more rationalizing arguments.”
Another debater, Jori Barash, said that this particular debate presented the challenge of appealing to a broader audience.
“When we debate something like this, it’s very specific in our context — we’ll be debating a particular element of it or at such a high level of breadth, you don’t get to talk about it like you would with another person over a dinner table,” Barash said. “Talking to people who are not debaters was an interesting challenge to not use debate words and be convincing in a general way to anybody.” 
Barash, who has been involved in the club since his freshman year, said that the club engages students well because new issues are presented each week. 
“I love all of my clubs, but in a lot of clubs you’ll do the activity that you do, get what you want out of it and then start to focus on other things as a junior or senior. What I love about debate is that, because you’re debating something new every week, we don’t lose engagement,” Barash said. “You can always compete, learn new things and meet new people, and it’s a really nice respite from the rest of campus.”
It’s encouraging these debates are encouraged, and that brings me to a hot-button topic worthy of debate.
Does anyone believe the Animists of Sudan deserve safe spaces from Muslim jihadists, or that Syrian Christians deserve the same, or that Hindus in Lahore deserve this right, or Baha’i in Iran, or gays in Saudi Arabia, or Jews in Israel, or Buddhists in southern Thailand?
As a member of the club discussed in the article, I can assert that the term “safe space” in of itself can draw so many different interpretations as to what it means, in what context it applies to, and what the characteristics of its application. 
To be honest, this comment seems like a loaded assertion that I know would get some push back. It also doesn’t seem to apply to the topic in discussion, which was merely the medium of debate, not one any any 1000s of topics that can be discussed through debate.

In order to raise awareness of the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses, Undergraduate Student Government, along with the rest of the Pac-12 schools, is hosting a campus-wide campaign called It Ends Here on Oct. 17-21.
USG Senior Director of Communications Luke Southwell-Chan took charge of organizing the campaign. As lead coordinator, he has been working with student governments from other universities as well as different departments on campus since August. 
“Over the summer there was a Pac-12 leadership summit, and we decided to do a joint project tackling the issue of sexual assault because it was pertinent to all 12 campuses, and it’s something important we should all be addressing,” Southwell-Chan said. “As a whole, we have a lot more power than just one single university.”
Southwell-Chan’s main goal was to show students who, though aware of the dangers of sexual assault, felt they lacked the power as single individuals to instigate any significant change. 
“We are trying to encourage students to take action, which I think could really make a difference in making this a bigger issue and changing the culture surrounding sexual assault,” Southwell-Chan said. 
The campaign kicked off with an art gallery consisting of original works submitted by students that focused on the theme of sexual assault. Carrie Zhang, a junior majoring in public relations and co-director of the Performing Arts Committee, was responsible for gathering the works, which consisted of both visual and written word pieces. 
“These pieces share a lot of people’s personal narratives about their relationship with their bodies, their sexualites, sexual assault and gender and sex-based harm,” Zhang said. “The art itself expresses parts of human emotions that could not otherwise be iterated into words.” 
Orian Raviv, a sophomore majoring in human biology, was one of the students who displayed her artwork — three charcoal portraits of the female form. 
“Your body is for yourself and not for anybody else,” Raviv said. “The whole culture of sexualizing women’s bodies is a really important issue that we need to discuss, and this is a great way to create a dialogue and a conversation.” 
Additionally, a teal wall was set up in the VKC courtyard, which students could take pictures in front of to show their support and solidarity with survivors of sexual assault. Justin Yang, the USG assistant director of photography and the designated photographer for this aspect of the campaign, hoped the awareness week would point victims of sexual assault toward the help available to them. 
“Right now, there are different resources on campus, like the Health Center, USG, [Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services], but they aren’t integrated, so when students encounter sexual assault, they don’t know where to go,” Yang said. “We are trying to raise awareness of the different organizations students can turn to when they need.”

Photo by Mike MorbeckRespecting authority · Green Bay Packers’ quarterback Aaron Rodgers made controversial comments about his coaches this season.
Coachability is important, whether you’re a young athlete, a professional athlete or even a non-athlete.
I attended a lunch event with Jacob Ullman of FOX Sports last week, and as he wrapped up his presentation, he put up a list of qualities that don’t require talent but can make anyone stand out in the work force. 
One of the qualities that stood out to me was being coachable. 
When I was little, my dad would always impart this advice on me. Of course, me being coachable made his life easier as my head coach for the plethora of sports that I played growing up, but I know that he shared that advice with me to better prepare me for the real world. To this day, I value this advice and instruction from my dad. 
In my third year of college, I’ve really come to appreciate when people are coachable. I’ve seen interactions between faculty and my peers and have observed that those who are willing to listen, take criticism in stride and — to put it simply — be coached are the ones who tend to get further than the ones who don’t.
So, it makes sense that the sports executive put up a list for success and being coachable was one of the qualities on the list. 
But, what about what happens when professional athletes aren’t coachable? 
Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is one of the first players that comes to mind. His personality is larger than whatever room he’s in. An argument can be made that most, if not all, NFL quarterbacks are this way, but that’s not the case.
Earlier this season, Rodgers made comments about the wet ball drills that his coach, Mike McCarthy, had the team do before their game in Detroit, where rain was forecasted.
ESPN quoted Rodgers saying that he went through the drill “as a favor to the coaches because I don’t like that drill, because it’s unrealistic.”
Yes, it’s good that he went through the drill for the sake of listening to the coach. I’m not saying that players should blindly listen to their coaches or people should blindly listen to their supervisors, but there should be a level of respect to how they act. 
Rodgers also carries himself with an aura that he’s better than those around him. This isn’t a secret. A number of current and former players have talked about this. 
I think part of being coachable comes with being a team player. To me, when someone is coachable, two things can come from it. One, the person themselves benefits from the instruction and advice. Two, the people surrounding that person — whether it be teammates or coworkers — will inherently benefit. A coachable player — in their willingness to learn — can improve the camaraderie and relationships of the team. When a player is willing to listen to instruction, he or she begins to improve their level of play, which, in turn, improves the play of the team. 
An NFL quarterback that comes to my mind as being coachable is Dallas Cowboys’ rookie quarterback Dak Prescott. In the absence of Tony Romo, this fourth-round pick has led the Cowboys to a 5-1 start.
As the time for Romo to come back into a starter role draws near, talk coming out of the Cowboys’ locker room has been that they support Prescott starting and that Romo hasn’t really been around. The locker room support around Prescott is a testament to Prescott as a player and as a teammate, not to mention that he’s helping lead the team to a winning season — something they’ve only had once in the last six years. 
Anyway, all of this started with the idea of being coachable. Regardless of what level a person is at, being coachable — as well as being a team player — is one of the best qualities someone can have and utilize to be successful.

Brian Chin | Daily Trojan“I’m sad for him” · A torn ACL will end redshirt junior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr.’s season. Mitchell was third on the team with 24 catches. Head coach Clay Helton said Mitchell was playing his “best ball.”
Redshirt junior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. is out for the season after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in USC’s road football game against the Arizona Wildcats on Saturday.
Though the Men of Troy dominated the Wildcats 48-14, Mitchell suffered a tear in his left knee while fielding a short punt and will miss the remainder of the year.
Mitchell’s injury comes during the most productive season of his USC career and three years after the Pasadena native tore his right ACL as a freshman.
“I thought he was playing his best ball,” head coach Clay Helton said. “I’m sad for him. I’m sad for our football team. You could tell how it affected everybody. He’s a kid that’s much beloved by our team, especially that wide receiver unit.”
As the team’s starting slot receiver, Mitchell ranks third on the team in receptions (24) and fourth in yards (226) with a touchdown.
With one year left of eligibility after redshirting his freshman season, Mitchell will be able to come back in 2017 and start once again for the Trojans.
In Mitchell’s place will be sophomore standout Deontay Burnett, who has caught 24 passes for 229 yards and two touchdowns.
Although fellow wide out senior Darreus Rogers and tight ends redshirt senior Taylor McNamara and sophomore Tyler Petite will be able to help relieve USC’s passing offense, Helton will have to find another kick returner to take Mitchell’s place. 
With most teams kicking away from junior Adoree’ Jackson, Mitchell’s replacement will have to provide the Trojans with adequate field position. 
With a bye week this week, the Trojans have extra time to adjust to Mitchell’s absence and perhaps insert Burnett or even freshman Michael Pittman Jr., who has returned a punt for 35 yards along with catching two passes for 21 yards. 
Thankfully for redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold, USC’s running game has averaged 177 yards per game and recorded eight touchdowns total thanks to a standout year from senior running back Justin Davis. 
The Men of Troy return to action against Cal next Thursday at the Coliseum.

Photo courtesy of The Daily WildcatWise beyond his years · Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold recorded five touchdowns against Arizona on Saturday. Head coach Clay Helton praised Darnold for his leadership and continuous drive to improve.
For any holdouts not yet drinking the Sam Darnold Kool-Aid, Saturday’s 48-14 win over Arizona should’ve done the trick. The redshirt freshman quarterback dazzled once again, throwing, scrambling and running circles all over the Wildcats’ defense to the tune of 235 yards and five touchdowns.
And yet, Darnold hardly flashed a smile when head coach Clay Helton pulled him in the fourth quarter with a big lead to put in backup redshirt junior Max Browne.
“You throw five touchdown passes — you’d think you get a smile and he’s like, ‘Coach, there’s more out there,’” Helton said.
Sure, there were throws that Darnold missed. The first play of the game, he uncorked a deep throw for junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster that went awry. On the next drive, he went long for senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers, but it sailed high.
But still, given that he connected with Smith-Schuster nine times for three touchdowns and completed 20 of 32 passes on the day for a stellar 94.6 quarterback rating, focusing on one or two bad throws would be nit-picking — but not for Darnold.
One could call him modest, but Darnold spoke after the game with a tone of confidence, that there definitely was more he could have done.
“You saw the long balls in the first half,” Darnold said. “Guys were open and I missed them. I had JuJu — it was man [coverage] and he’s going to win most of the time. I missed him. I skipped my progression and went on to someone else. We’ll look at it in film. There’s definitely more out there to be scored.”
For now, he’s done his part and more in rejuvenating USC’s offense, which sputtered under Browne in the season opener against Alabama and at Stanford in the third week before Helton turned to Darnold.
After putting up 16 points total against the Crimson Tide and Cardinal, the Trojans have scored at least 20 points in each of the four games with Darnold under center. The redshirt freshman has made plays with his legs and arm, scrambling to gain yards when the play breaks down and improvising on the fly.
On Saturday, he kept a drive alive in the first half with several third down runs, escaping the pocket and diving for the sticks.
“It makes it a different ball game,” Helton said. “When you have the weapons outside, you pick your poison about who you’re going to defend. We went 7-of-13 on third downs. They were not all passes. Some of it was [Darnold] pulling it down, making it with his legs.”
Helton also praised how Darnold kept open the option for a pass, even when scrambling from pressure.
“You’re not seeing a lot of forced throws by him,” Helton said. “He’s finding the open receivers and his eyes stay downfield, even when he’s running out of the pocket. That’s what you want from a quarterback. He’s getting first downs with his legs, but he’s also creating plays downfield with his arms when things break down.”
Perhaps the happiest camper with the quarterback switch is Smith-Schuster, who has seen a dramatic uptick in receptions and targets with Darnold flinging passes his way.
“It’s so fun,” the junior wide receiver said on playing with Darnold. “You don’t know what he’s going to do. He’s able to throw the ball across his body. He’s also able to throw the ball like a spiral — super fast.”
Three of those spirals resulted in scores on Saturday — the first was on a screen play from three yards out, the second was a short pass that Smith-Schuster turned into a spectacular, tackle-breaking touchdown and the third was a leaping grab in the second half for a 46-yard touchdown, a throw that Darnold placed perfectly for Smith-Schuster to jump up and snag over the defender.
“There’s a lot of times I can fit a ball in there and find a window,” Darnold said on throwing to Smith-Schuster. “He’s an every-down receiver and someone who can block on the perimeter as well. He’s a huge asset and someone we’d like to have back moving forward.”
Smith-Schuster said that since Darnold was named the starter, the two have kicked off a special connection.
“We hang out together,” he said. “We’re like frat boys, loving one another. You have to trust somebody with everything that you have, everything that you got. I feel like he has to do the same thing, and it makes [football] a lot easier.”
Smith-Schuster said spending time outside of football with Darnold helps develop their relationship on the field.
“It’s an official bromance,” Smith-Schuster said. “Use that. Don’t tell him, though.”
The “bromance,” though, can include tough love. On the practice field, the two call each other out on mistakes.
“I’ll say, ‘Dude, that’s a bad ball,’” Smith-Schuster said. “I’m going to call him out. That’s what grown men do. You’ve got to own up to your mistakes. He does the same thing to me.”
Darnold has only been in the spotlight for a couple of weeks, but his humble, soft-spoken demeanor has stood out, as has his desire to improve week-by-week. Last week against Colorado, USC committed four turnovers, with Darnold fumbling twice and throwing an interception. On Saturday, it was a marked improvement — zero turnovers, with the ball staying firmly tucked in on every scramble.
“It was a huge emphasis this week in practice, taking care of the ball,” Darnold said. “It was on my mind the whole game. I just didn’t want to turn the ball over.”
For the next game against Cal, it will be likely be connecting more on deep throws. Given the extra week to prepare and Cal’s struggles on defense, the Bears would be advised to look out.
“I’m just going week-by-week,” Darnold said. “If I progress, I progress, but I think that’s a part of growing mentally and physically.”
The more Darnold speaks, the more he comes across as a redshirt freshman with the maturity of a true veteran, which is music to Helton’s ears.
“That’s what you want from your leaders,” Helton said. “He’s like his coaches. He’s a perfectionist. He’d be a great coach one day. He’s one of those guys that expects perfection and demands it of himself as well as his teammates, and that’s important.”

Sometime last year, in the midst of making one of my numerous Spotify playlists, I noticed that a couple of songs I added sounded similar. In fact, when I went back and really listened to the songs, I wasn’t sure if the lyrics were that great to start out with, or if the beat they were on made them sound that much better. To get to the bottom of this, I went straight to the source, and suddenly it all made sense to me.
The producer of many of these songs that I loved, was one of, if not, the greatest producer of all time: J Dilla. To everyone who keeps up with this column (thanks, Mom and Dad), you know that last week I talked about the emphatically smooth sounds that came from Slum Village’s album  Fantastic, Vol. 2. Nearly all of the tracks on that album were produced solely by J Dilla, which explained why I loved the album so much despite its lyrics.
The more I explored, the more dumbfounded I became at this man’s grotesquely extensive list of songs he produced. From A Tribe Called Quest to my favorite Common song ever made, “The Light,” J Dilla has had his name attached to some of my favorite hip-hop songs of all time. 
To top it off, I discovered he even has a few albums of his own, one of which was Donuts, which I knew was a Detroit underground classic. My expectations of this album before I listened to it for the first time were astronomically high — I expected songs that were more along the lines of “Find A Way,” “The Light” and Fantastic, Vol. 2. My expectations weren’t exactly met.
This album is anything but consistent. With almost every song on the album lasting under two minutes, this feels more like a spastic mixtape hyped-up on caffeine. This is both a blessing and a curse, since you can hear many styles, from jazz, funk, R&B, soul, rock n’ roll and many more mixing and matching with other genres simultaneously to create something never heard of before. The longest song on the album, “Workinonit,” has samples from eight songs in it alone.
However, it can get really annoying when you land on a track that has everything you like— from the drum sample down to the obscure soul sample that even your grandpa might not recognize — mesh together to form a match made in heaven, only to have it suddenly switch to something you’re not really feeling. The upside is that with all of the dynamic sounds on the album, something else is going to come along and make you say, “Damn, how did he do that?” with amazement all over again.
J Dilla is someone who accomplished great things in his career and actually made a difference in the world of music. Despite not being the most well-known producer, anyone who considers themselves true fans of hip-hop know that J Dilla is nothing short of a god in the genre, and his influence has helped to change the music scene in more ways than one. Many hip-hop artists, such as A Tribe Called Quest, The Pharcyde and The Roots wouldn’t be hailed as legends in their craft without J Dilla, who changed the genre of hip-hop as a whole. Even NPR commends J Dilla as “one of the music industry’s most influential hip-hop artists,” and rightfully so.
Donuts, unlike the food it’s named after, only gets better with age. Each time I listen to this album, I gain a newfound respect for it. If you’ve ever wondered what the blueprints for an artist’s thought process is like, this is it.
This album is the manifestation of Dilla’s sketches, spitballed ideas and what ifs all in the form of dozens of short songs that have almost no relation to each other. It’s intentionally paradoxical in nature, sounding like controlled chaos for the entire album, but it’s entirely unique and unlike anything you’ve ever heard before.
Unfortunately, J Dilla died at the age of 32, just three days after this album was released. In a way, Donuts represents the last spark of J Dilla’s brilliance, which only adds to the album’s significance. It’s another great work of art from this Great Lake State native, and it’s one I can take pride in when it comes to Michigan’s music history. He’s an icon that’s an inspiration to anyone from the great state of Michigan.
Being from Michigan and sharing a birthday with J Dilla, I think of this man as a role model, as he shows how anyone — no matter where you’re from — can make such a profound difference in the world doing what you love.
Rest in beats, Dilla.

Photo from TwitterEvery vote counts · #IAAA held its concert on Sunday evening at the Wiltern. Artists, such as AJ Rafael (above) performed for the audience.
Our voices matter. Our votes count. This was the motto the #IAmAsianAmerican (#IAAA) movement was founded upon.
The initiative began only nine weeks ago when its founder, Uyen Tieu, learned of the shocking statistics behind Asian American voter turnout. She was inspired to begin the #IAmAsianAmerican movement to empower the millennial vote, and within weeks, the program planned a concert that took place in four cities nationwide: Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C. and New York. 
#IAmAsianAmerican was more than just a campaign about getting out the vote; it was about making a historical statement in the polls that will impact not only the presidential race, but also congressional and local elections.
It was a campaign to shape the future of the nation through the Asian American voice and to remind voters, especially millennials, that their vote mattered. 
#IAAA hosted its concert and celebrity event on Oct. 16 at the Wiltern Theater, hosted by comedians Jenny Yang and Parvesh Cheena. The concert aimed to promote its national campaign goal of registering at least 15,000 new voters while strengthening and celebrating the Asian American voice. 
The event drew in many notable Asian American artists, keynote speakers and professionals who were united in #IAAA’s mission. 
“I don’t know about you, but I’m tired of being called the silent majority,” said Paul Y. Song, a health-care activist and medical professional. 
The entire theater erupted with cheers and applause in response to his statement. The recurring message of empowering the Asian American voice resonated throughout the entire event, promoted by musicians, actors and dancers alike. 
“I feel like we are the generation of change,” said founder Uyen Tieu as she reflected on the sacrifices of her parents and the older Asian American generations. 
The lineup of performers exhibited the change mentioned by Tieu in demonstrating diverse Asian American excellence. The performers and speakers came from unique walks of life — each with a story of their own to tell. 
Tony Award-winning poet Beau Sia delivered a heartfelt poem on what the community’s vote demonstrated to American society. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and activist Jose Antonio Vargas spoke about the struggle of being undocumented and addressed the rising numbers of Asian immigrants. 
Other performers contributed to the discussion through their art. Artists like AJ Rafael and Megan Lee touched the audience with their vocals and original acoustic songs. Meanwhile, the Poreotics dance team, rapper SETI X and singer DANakaDAN brought their energy to the stage in their electric performances. 
In between sets, many notable Asian American figures dropped by through video to discuss the importance of voting. Constance Wu and Randall Park from ABC’s Fresh Off the Boat both had individual video segments speaking about the importance of the Asian American vote and representation. 
“Your vote matters,” said Wu, who is a strong advocate for Asian American representation in the entertainment industry. 
The child actors from the sitcom also made an appearance on stage, asking the audience to be their voice in November since they are not yet old enough to vote. 
Wesley Chan and Philip Wang from Wong Fu Productions cued in through video as well. Their message was clear — it doesn’t matter who you’re voting for, as long as you go out to the polls to make your voice heard. 
“When you cast your vote on Nov. 8, you are standing on the shoulders of those before us,” said Kent Wong, director of the UCLA Labor Center. 
His powerful speech took the audience throughout periods of oppression in Asian American history, from the Chinese Exclusion Act to the Japanese internment camps. 
“We want to encourage a new generation of Asian Pacific Islanders to engage with our electoral system,” said Christine Chen, executive director of APIAVote. 
Despite Tieu’s initial goal of creating a platform for Asian Americans to vote, her campaign has become part of a greater message about inclusion.

She had to make a decision — attend a callback for a national Target commercial or take a required acting final. 
Photo courtesy of Jona XiaoAct it out · Jona Xiao recently joined the cast of Spider-Man: Homecoming, which is slated for release in summer 2017. She will also have a minor role in the action-comedy film Keeping Up with the Joneses.
Jona Xiao, who stars in the upcoming film Keeping Up with the Joneses, faced this decision while she was a student at USC. Instead of conceding that she would have to give up either an opportunity for a huge break in acting or her grades, she found a way to do both. 
Arriving early for the callback, Xiao was able to make it back to campus in time for her final. She still got an A on the test and then booked the Target spot. “You can do it all!” Xiao said, throwing her hands in the air, showing off the ambitious attitude that has put her on the map in one of the most competitive industries in Los Angeles.
While at USC, Xiao was in the business cinematic arts program — a unique major that gave her  knowledge on the business side of her craft — a choice to which she owes her acting success. Her role in the new movie starring Jon Hamm and Zach Galifianakis, Keeping Up with the Joneses, has given her the confidence to find her place among Hollywood’s elite. 
“I think that was a good reminder to see these amazing actors as my peers, all in this together, and to appreciate it knowing this is where I belong,” Xiao said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
Xiao seems like she has it all — a degree from a prestigious college, a good head on her shoulders and an acting gig in high power movies. However, she fought hard for every scrap of success she has achieved. She credits her success to two decisions she made in college: the first was learning the business side of the industry. 
“When I first started out, I was clueless. I was scammed,” Xiao said. “I didn’t know how to partner with the right team of people to help and support me along the journey.” 
She learned how to make connections from friends, a skill that led to her first role. Her mantra is “successful people do it themselves, but never alone.” 
As an actress, Xiao prioritizes her independence as a key factor in building her career. However, she also realizes that having support is necessary.
“Yes, you shouldn’t ever rely on someone else.” Xiao said. “But you absolutely should and have to ask for support from other people in order to achieve your goals, especially if they are big goals.” 
When it comes to controversial issues,such as the underrepresentation of Asian Americans in film, she states that while it may not be ideal, “it’s hard to be picky” when it comes to stereotypical roles, such as playing a manicurist in an Asian nail salon. But Xiao does not concede to the “I-Can’t-Do-Anything-About-It-So-Why-Bother-Trying” school of thought.
“Those people exist and one way to look at is, you’re still bringing to light their story, and it’s a real story,” Xiao said.
Xiao’s momentum shows no signs of slowing down. Her next role is in the highly anticipated Spider-Man: Homecoming. She cannot discuss the specific details of her role, but she mentions that this Spider-Man is “a little bit closer to the comic books that people grew up with. He’s a little more sarcastic and raw in that way.” 
“He’s very charming. He’s very outgoing. On set, he was the life of the party. At the same time, he’s very down to earth,” Xiao said, on working with actor Jon Hamm. “You knew when John was on set. He’d introduce himself to everyone. He was a dream to work with.” 
Of course, there’s more to Hamm than his dashing good looks. Xiao added that she coached Hamm with some of his Mandarin lines in the film, admitting that she was really impressed.
Xiao is poised and confident, though kind and willing to give back to her alma mater. She said she owes a lot to USC and has even offered to come back and speak with aspiring actors. Xiao has clearly taken her own advice in forging a career that could potentially become one of USC’s greatest success stories.

More often than not, the informed citizen cares little for the percentage jargon that accompanies the emission standards discussion — 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, 27 percent of 2005 levels by 2025 — it can all be very difficult to process. Interests lies more generally: People want to know if enough is being done to combat climate change, and if ultimately the larger human race will survive. The answer is typically not encouraging. Global emission commitments aggregated across the board are certainly not enough in the global climate change discourse; if all the nations that signed on to the COP 21 agreement at the Paris Climate Summit meet their targets, which is unlikely, there will still be approximately 2 degrees Celsius of warming. In context, science has been stating for many years than any warming past 2 degrees would be catastrophic. The next question then begs, what, if anything, can be done to combat this very wicked problem.
This past week, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger returned to Sacramento to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of AB 32, a bill that requires the state of California to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to reflect 1990 emission levels by 2020. When it was passed in 2006, AB 32 was the first program in the country to take a comprehensive, long-term approach in addressing climate change. Today, it remains the most aggressive emission reduction goal ever to be passed by any state or nation. It is significant to note that Schwarzenegger is a Republican, and one of the few Republican politicians to have ever supported any climate bill. As politics turn more partisan, the existential threat of climate change steadily becomes disconnected from its science and shrouded in scripted, empty party slogans. Schwarzenegger’s spearheading of this bill is an example of a small step in moving away from fluffy, presumptuous words and toward the understanding that climate action is the joint responsibility of both United States political parties. USC should do the same.
The California drought, a direct reflection of climate change, is the most apparent issue facing California and the city of Los Angeles. Because of its urban nature, Los Angeles residents, and especially USC students, often do not recognize the severe impact that the drought has on other parts of the state. In September, residents of Catalina Island had to cut their freshwater consumption by 50 percent, a staggering statistic that USC students would have extreme difficulty adjusting to if the same were mandated by the city of Los Angeles. 
With that information and the understanding that environmental problems are complex, without clear solutions and often severely lacking in funding and attention, USC can and should in no way call itself a green campus. USC physically looks green — explicitly because it is not. The campus boasts 31 fountains, which each naturally lose about 1,000 gallons of water per month that could be used for drinking, landscaping and agricultural work, among other things. USC is home to an enormous non-native plant population that consumes a disproportionately high amount of water compared to native plant species (most notably, the palm tree, which in actuality originates from tropical and subtropical regions of the world and is ill-fitted for the dry desert climate of Southern California). Finally, and most significantly, USC lacks even the most meager efforts at solar energy, which is ironic for a well-resourced, progressive university located in a consistently sunny part of the world. 
While there is a scattered assortment of environmental projects, mostly pushed by students, faculty and the understaffed Sustainability Office, there is nothing substantial enough to make a real dent in USC’s heavy water consumption or its 55,000 ton yearly CO2 production. Action is being taken to reduce water consumption but not with the immediacy that the drought demands.
Students have a number of steps that they can take to live their personal lives more sustainably, but economic structures that exist within the United States and at the University make it virtually impossible to be truly sustainable. Large scale, top-down change is needed to make real progress, and that starts with the University’s administration and with the larger state of California.

At the outset of Sunday’s 16-6 win over No. 7 UC Santa Barbara at Uytengsu Aquatics Center, it looked as though No. 3 men’s water polo would have a marathon on its hands. 
Both teams combined for 4 goals in the first two minutes and a total of 7 by end of the first period. It was not until the second quarter that the Trojans’ defense began to look like the powerhouse opponents are accustomed to facing. 
 “We just knew that we needed to calm down,” freshman driver Thomas Dunstan said on how his team weathered the early storm. “It was a long week of training but we knew that we had the best goalie in the country in the cage (junior McQuin Baron) so we could just have confidence in him and know that we’d win.” 
Dunstan himself provided a stellar effort for the Trojan cause adding 2 goals and four first half assists.
Early in the second quarter, the Gauchos tied the game with a goal from Ivan Gvozdanovic, but they would never come close again. Sophomore driver Zach D’Sa promptly added 2 goals to extend USC’s lead to 6-4. 
Then the spotlight was handed over to junior driver Blake Edwards, who took over the day with a stunning scoring output. After already netting in the first quarter, Edwards scored three consecutive times, once off of a 5-meter penalty shot that rocketed into the corner. Edwards saved his most spectacular shot for the final seconds of the first half, when he just managed to get off a cheeky lob shot, fooling keeper Liam Lenham as time expired with the Trojans up 11-5. 
 “It’s just instinct,” Edwards said on the goal. “I didn’t really have any time to think. I just saw an opportunity to finish and I did. There wasn’t too much thought; I was probably more surprised than anyone else.” 
Edwards scored five times in the first half, with his fifth making his 100th career goal for the Men of Troy. 
“I didn’t know until after the game that it was my 100th career goal,” Edwards said. “I’m really happy, but more importantly I’m just happy with the performance of the team today. We played really well offensively and we’re starting to work together a lot better.” 
For the season, Edwards leads the team with 32 goals averaging an eye popping 2 scores per game. 
“It’s just going really fast and it’s going so fast because I’m enjoying it so much,” Edwards said on reaching the century mark. “I love this school and I love this team and the opportunities they’ve given me.” 
The second half featured much less explosive offensive play from both squads. The Gauchos scored their final goal in the third quarter and then were stifled by goalie Baron in the final frame. It was the Trojans’ 27th shutout period of the season, making them 15-0 in games in which that was accomplished. Baron continued his stellar season with a solid 10-save day, leading the league with 135 on the season. Just last week, Baron became USC’s second all time leader in that category, recording his 676th career save against No. 8 Pepperdine earlier this month.  
Lachlan Edwards also recorded two goals, while D’Sa supplying a hat trick. Dunstan set up a dizzying amount of first half goals and added two scores himself. The final goal of the game came off of junior Bryce Hoerman, who extended the Trojan lead to 16-6 as the clock winded down.
With this most recent win, the Trojans are now 15-1 on the season with their only loss being to conference foe, No. 2 Cal. USC’s next game comes this Sunday at Long Beach State in USC’s first match against an unranked opponent since September.

Hailed by high school students, closely monitored by administrators and greeted with a shrug of the shoulders by the rest of society, college rankings, despite their faults, shed a new light on American universities each year. To the delight of Trojans, U.S. News and World Report ranked USC one spot ahead of UCLA, and the Wall Street Journal catapulted the University to a lofty No. 15 this year. Yet a lowly ranking of 155 by TIME’s Money served as a wakeup call, reminding USC that it needs to become more cost-effective. Lost among all these rankings, Washington Monthly, which analyzed social mobility, research and community service came to the conclusion that USC in comparison to its peers stands at 46. On face value, this assessment seems hardly something to wring one’s hands over, but upon closer inspection, USC’s service rank of 161 sticks out as a sore thumb, especially in comparison to UCLA’s score of 52 in service or UC San Diego’s rank of 21. Despite an ongoing effort to improve the surrounding community, USC and its students still have a way to go in terms of cultivating a spirit of service on campus and after graduation.
The criteria that makes up the service ranking includes participation through service-based organizations such as ROTC and the Peace Corps; the amount of federal work-study grant money spent on community service projects; the percentage of students doing community service, the number of hours of community service per student, whether any staff were employed in community service; and finally, if any service courses are offered, and whether the University provides scholarships for community service. This ranking comprehensively surveys how USC and other colleges stack up in terms of giving back.
 Despite its disappointing ranking, USC, especially in recent years, has made a concentrated effort to devote time, money and resources to the local community. Roughly once a month on Friends and Neighbors Day, hundreds of USC students work on projects like beautification in the surrounding area. The Center for Civic Engagement has invested millions of dollars in local businesses and nonprofits and has forged partnerships with surrounding schools. Many fraternities and sororities hold fundraisers that raise thousands upon thousands of dollars for great causes. And USC clubs and organizations, from the Joint Education Project to Troy Camp to Share a Meal all dedicate hours upon hours to benefit local students and volunteer organizations.
 But there’s room for improvement. Despite students studying in the midst of South Central — one of the epicenters of homelessness in the United States — only a handful of campus organizations work with the homeless. Many student groups scramble to find volunteers on a weekly basis. A lack of funding often limits the ambitions of too many service clubs.
 In terms of career development, alumni don’t all have to work in developing nations to still incorporate service into their postgraduate plans. But there needs to be more of an emphasis in the undergraduate experience to reinforce the notion that everyone can and should make a difference. For starters, USC could offer more courses with hands on service components or ones that emphasize how to apply knowledge learned in the classroom to solve social issues and economic inequality. In addition, students could take these skills and incorporate them in their extracurricular work, much like some students do with their pro bono consulting. Cultivating this culture of service during students’ years at USC will make a lasting impression in the lives of Trojans and a lasting difference in the world.
On the administrative level, more work-study funds could be diverted towards nonprofits in South Central that address poverty, homelessness and education inequity. In fact, Stanford doles out 22.3 percent of its work study funds on community service and outreach. Looking to USC’s immediate future, the newly laid foundations of the Village present the University with transformative opportunities. Even though this ambitious project to expand on campus housing and shopping provides jobs now and in the future for locals, concerns such as higher food prices in the new shops remain in the community. And despite USC planning to invest millions in affordable housing in the nearby area, according to USC’s State of the Neighborhood Report, in USC’s study area, from 2008 to 2012 47.3 percent of families with children lived in poverty, compared with a rate of 25.2 percent in Los Angeles as a whole. To double down on its investment in the local community, USC should also devote resources toward creating a substantial community center to provide job training, classes and other services to those struggling in our own backyard.
As students we must realize that our college experience extends past the borders of our campus. The challenges faced by our neighbors should not weigh us down or render us apathetic, rather, they should incentive us to get involved and do our part. Doing so can help us fully emerge out of the stereotype of the “University of Spoiled Children” and become known as the “University for the Service-Centered” or at least the “University of the Socially Conscious.”

As both a teenage girl and an avid foodie (the kind of foodie that eats a lot and thinks about food too much, rather than the kind of foodie that tries new things and dines out lavishly), the conflicts between food, nutrition, body image and self-love are all too real, and all to unwelcomed.
In a world where society projects a multitude of ‘ideal’ body standards for both women and men, it’s no wonder so many young adults and teenagers struggle with their confidence and the nurturing of love within and for themselves. Girls are expected not only to have the tiny waist, but to have the big bust, too – to have the big lips, prominent cheekbones, nice collarbones, slim thighs, toned legs, perfect glow, glossy hair, clear skin, no dark circles, muscular (but not too muscular) arms, and ‘flat abs’ – all without looking like we work out or monitor our food.
In film, too often the ‘ideal’ woman is both slender and sheik, yet down-to-earth and eats only hot dogs at the Basketball, eats a block of chocolate a day, and drinks way too much wine every night (though, magically, it doesn’t affect their physicality at all!) – as though being unhealthy and eating food like you don’t care about your body correlates with being cool and more attractive?

It’s a whirlwind of expectations, motivation, cravings, resentment, guilt and so much more, wherein our weight is both within and without of our control.
However, at the end of the day, what you eat really is up to you, and furthermore, really can control how you feel about yourself.
Personally, through trying to eat clean and monitor my nutrient consumption, I have found that my reasons for consciously eating ‘healthy’ foods have changed over time. While a few years ago, I may have increased my intake of fruits and vegetables with the goal of looking great – but this was unsustainable. The only reason I continue to eat clean and invest in fresh produce each week, is because the right foods make me feel good.
Yes, I feel more energized, awake, focused, satisfied, whole – but most importantly, I feel more confident. My physique hasn’t changed much, my skin remains problematic at times, my stomach is still miles away from those ‘flat abs’ – but through caring about my health rather than my appearance, I’ve come to subconsciously embrace the fact that, so long as I’m making healthy choices and eating in a way that enhances my energy, I am confident in me.
Courtesy of Annie Hickey
This dichotomy of food and appearance, and the common tensions between eating less and exercising more, not for your health, but for your aesthetics, exists only within your mind, and only because you let it. So long as you make decisions about your body based upon stereotypes of another’s (probably photo shopped) body, that negative undertone will always triumph. Always. Conversely, when your actions – diet, exercise, sleep, organization, focus – are motivated by a deeper goal for feeling healthy and exuding radiance; that is when your self-love and appreciation will arrive.
You are already there, physically – wherever you stand right now is exactly the right place to be.
Choose your foods wisely and enjoy the taste of whole foods and authentic, plant-based nutrition. In doing so, you are choosing to be you, and not the girl in the commercial; this is all the strength you will ever want, and ever need.

Going to church on a Friday night is definitely an anomaly to my typical weekend routine. In fact, before this semester I never did go to church on a regular basis. However, things changed around for me when I started studying the pipe organ as one of my electives at the Thornton School of Music. Now I go every Tuesday morning to the Pasadena Presbyterian Church, where I am able to enjoy one of the most sophisticated and noble instruments I have ever heard. Even better, I get to learn how to play the organ.  
“Special” is the adjective I use to describe my lessons. To clarify, the greatness of my class does not necessarily stem from the instrument itself. My lessons are special because I am instructed by a very special musician, Cherry Rhodes. Miss Rhodes is an internationally acclaimed organist who has won numerous worldwide competitions, has performed as a soloist for various prominent orchestras, such as the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and taught organ at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore. If I were to list all of my teacher’s musical accomplishments, this article would be as long as the last Harry Potter book. 
Nevertheless, on Friday, October 7th I was invited to my teacher’s organ concert. I arrived at the concert venue to find myself in a gorgeous cathedral, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. The room seemed infinite, with ceilings that soared high above my head. I brought my sister along with me and we quietly sat down for the concert. 
The program contained contemporary pieces, as most of the composers wrote during the 20th century. The pieces were incredible, but Miss Rhodes’s brilliant playing was what truly stole the show. The ease at which she played the intricate melodies was breathtaking and inspirational. For the two hours that I watched her concert, not a single worry about my messy dorm room, my impending midterms, or my suffocating deadlines seemed to bother me.
Not only am I lucky to have such a musician guide me in my own desire to learn the complexities behind the organ, but I am also fortunate to know such an impressive individual on a personal level. It amazes me how Miss Rhodes is able to positively influence the emotions of an entire auditorium, just by sharing her talent. 
Conclusively, I am thrilled that I went to church on a Friday night. This concert reminded me of the power of music and the need to share it.
