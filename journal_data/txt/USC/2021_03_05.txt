When I applied to USC, I was under the impression that my first year of college would be highlighted by the play of the football team.
USC, after all, is a football school. The school has had seven Heisman trophy winners, 39 conference championships and 11 national championships. The bright lights of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, its roaring crowd and Tommy Trojan are staples of college football tradition and history.
However, in a time of uncertainty, in the middle of a global pandemic and empty arenas, men’s basketball has proved why USC isn’t just a football school.
Sure, the last time the Trojans won the Pac-12 Championship was the 1984-85 season. But what they’ve done this year deserves serious recognition. 
Coming into the season, head coach Andy Enfield had only three returning rotational players — sophomore guard Ethan Anderson and sophomore forwards Isaiah Mobley and Max Agbonkpolo. 
Myriad transfers including redshirt senior guard Tahj Eaddy, junior guard Drew Peterson and senior guard Isaiah White rounded out a squad filled with a mix of veterans and raw talent. 
With the arrival of freshman forward Evan Mobley, the former No.1 recruit in the country, pre-season expectations were a bit difficult to settle on. In fact, media members voted USC to finish sixth in the preseason poll, which has since proven to be a horrible, extremely inaccurate prediction. 
After the Trojans’ first win against Cal Baptist, Enfield highlighted that the team had “never played together, never had a scrimmage,” prior to the season opener. The pandemic forced a limited training camp with players never being able to practice as one whole group.
With words like that, you might have expected the season to tip-off slow and inconsistently. However, the opposite happened.
USC won three of its first four games before their season was paused due to a coronavirus outbreak within the program. Their only loss in that span was a game against UConn,  where USC had a shot to tie the game during the final possession of regulation. 
Any fan paying attention could see what was brewing, and I thought to myself: “Could USC have an unusually successful season?”
The winning trend continued once USC resumed their season. The Trojans went on to win 14 of their next 16 games over a month span following the coronavirus outbreak, including huge victories against UCLA, Stanford and both Arizona schools on the road. 
The Trojans established themselves as not only the best defense in the Pac-12, but also one of the best in the entire country. 
They became demons on defense, crashing the board for rebounds and diving for loose balls with no regard for the concrete off the hardwood floor. Their energy and effort became inspiring during a time where we grew more despondent as months in quarantine continued to add up. 
The Mobley brothers became a pairing on the court as dominant as the Mario brothers, sparking memes all over Twitter. Eaddy and Anderson established a backcourt partnership that would make opposing teams dizzy. Eaddy would score at will and in moments where they most counted. Anderson would muscle his way through guards while dropping sweet dimes and swishing threes. 
It was a brand of basketball USC fans across the country grew to love. It was riveting and exciting — I felt proud to go to a school with a basketball team like this. The team’s performances also earned USC its first spot in the rankings since 2017. 
With each game and each victory, they inched closer and closer to the inevitable Pac-12 title that will be battled for Saturday against UCLA.
Of course, all good things must come to an end. After notching their seventh win in a row, they fell to Arizona in bizarre fashion. What came next was what I feared the most: a drop-off in play.
Suddenly, the Trojans became a lackluster defensive team and their effort diminished. It resulted in three losses in the next four games and with the squad clinging for life. To put the team’s rut in context, USC only had three losses in its first 21 games.
However, a bounceback win against Stanford Wednesday sets up a date with destiny Saturday at Pauley Pavillion.
Can the Trojans hold on to win the Pac-12 title? I believe so.
Will it be an easy outing? Of course not. 
The Trojans will still need a favor from Oregon State. Since Oregon beat UCLA Wednesday night, they now have the best win percentage in conference play. USC needs to beat the Bruins and the Beavers to beat Oregon Sunday to secure the Pac-12 title. 
It’s just another rift in the plans during an improbable season. But what else would USC want more than to beat their rivals in the last game of the season to keep their chances alive for their first Pac-12 title in 36 years?
It’s what you dream for growing up playing basketball — and the Trojans have their shot. 
In the most improbable of seasons, it’s time for USC to shock us again and show why this is more than just a football school. 
Game on.

USC men’s basketball associate head coach Jason Hart, a Los Angeles native, has been a part of one of the most successful runs in the program’s history. Since Hart came to USC from Pepperdine as a member of head coach Andy Enfield’s staff in 2013, the program has landed an increased number of high-profile recruits and kept USC at or near the top of the conference standings for extended periods of time. Now in their eighth season, Hart, Enfield and the rest of the coaching staff have the Trojans in contention to win their first regular season conference title since the 1984-85 season.
Hart, a father of two, considers himself to be a coach who empathizes with his players. Hart uses his experience as a former NBA point guard and high school head coach to help him on the recruiting trail and while coaching. With USC’s regular season finale against UCLA coming up, the Daily Trojan spoke with Hart to get a better sense of his perspective and outlook on coaching.    
DT: You said you’re trying to build longevity in USC’s program. What do you think the program’s been missing where they haven’t been able to achieve consistency? And what do you think’s been changing recently?
JH: Well, I’m from L.A. and I was a top recruit and I didn’t go here. One of the toughest problems that a school like USC faces is it’s known as a football school. For me, my mom didn’t want me to go to a football school. She wanted me to go somewhere where the school and the school’s fans are just as excited about basketball as they are football. So, that was one of the reasons I took my journey to Syracuse. My neighborhood friend, Paul Pierce, he went to Kansas. Then obviously, Baron Davis went to UCLA. Tayshaun Prince went to Kentucky. Every now and then you will get an elite level local player that comes to USC. With Jordan McLaughlin, he kind of started a trend for us in our tenure here. I can’t speak on before we were here, but our tenure. From McLaughlin, they brought Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu. Now, people are starting to look at it as a viable place to come play basketball. So that’s just been our uphill battle. We don’t get the same sellout crowds or the notoriety as those elite programs, so our goal is to try to find the best California kids who want to come and be different, and have a different legacy attached to their name.
DT: This year’s team bucked the trend. You guys have gone big while the rest of basketball seems to be going small. How did you ensure this was going to work on the court instead of just making it look good on paper? 
 JH: Well, we didn’t trust it. Anytime you get a team, you always start from the basics. Just like last year’s team, we did the same with this team in terms of putting in foundation pieces, starting off with defense. And then we build out from there. We play to the talent level that we receive, that commits to our program. Then we try to maximize their strengths to fit what we like to do. This team, it just came together. It was more of a team that had a great bond with each other and trusted each other, and that’s why they’ve had a pretty good season, thus far. It’s not over yet, but, thus far, they’ve been playing pretty well. Last weekend, we didn’t have a good weekend, but overall, they’ve been able to hold their focus.
DT: When you have a team that has been rolling and they have a couple bad losses, or they lose games they believe they should have won, what do you tell the team in the locker room after that? What’s the message you send when you still have a lot to play for?
 JH: Well see the fans always say “You should have won.” Everybody has a dream. Should have won — I played professionally. That’s just somebody’s narrative. No, we shouldn’t have won. We didn’t play good, so we lost. Now, somebody probably expected us to win, but if you don’t play well, you’re going to lose regardless of who your opponent is. Colorado has an NBA point guard. He’s really good. And Utah just caught us on a bad day, and they’re a good team. The thing is it’s like life, you got knocked on your ass and now you’ve got to get up and keep going, nobody’s going to feel sorry for you. That’s the message. We didn’t beat them down and say “Those guys are inferior to us.” No, they played a better basketball game. And that’s what it is. Now you have to pick yourself up and get to the next game and be prepared for the next game.
DT: Are there any older NBA traditions or a way the game is played that you try to remind your players about?
JH: I don’t use NBA terminology with our guys. With them living in an age of anxiety and social media, I don’t want to put any more anxiety on those guys. They go to USC, they’re college students. I’m going to tell them about these things using reference to college terms. You did mention that we are a big team, I guess that’s probably our own only similarity to old NBA. But we don’t emphasize anything NBA because they have enough anxieties and pressures already just living in the day and age that they are today.
DT: How do you help players adjust to life in L.A. when they’re coming from out of state, given your perspective as someone who left L.A. and went across the country to play college basketball?
JH: The kids we recruit, we try to find somewhat of a gym rat type player — somebody who’s dedicated and who does have dreams and aspirations to get into the NBA. We also try to find student-athletes who care about their academics as much as basketball. They do well out here. Now sometimes, people come out here and fall in love with the city more than the school and the sport. It’s just a balance, sometimes we’ll take a lesser talented player, just to know that he fits our system. It’s just a balance of who you’re going after and who you recruit.
DT: When you become a head coach at the D-1 level, what would have to happen here at USC for you to say “That was a successful part of my career?”
JH: It’s already been a successful part of my career. We’ve been able to stay here for eight years without getting fired. Anytime you can stay at a school for more than two or three years that means [you’re doing] something right. Now we’re going to be a victim of our own success here shortly because we’re turning a lot of pros, getting this player, that player. Eventually, it’s going to start saying we need to see more and do more. And we’re heading in that direction but before us there wasn’t winning like this. We’ve already been a success. I don’t feel our program should have to do anything more for me to get a job. I’m happy with what we did already. We’ve graduated every senior that came through our program.
DT: What’s the mood within the team right now and what would make this season a success?
JH: The mood on a plane ride home Saturday was very somber and down, as it should be. They played like crap and they felt it. So they took Sunday off, got their mind right and they came to work on Monday and Tuesday with a better attitude and more of a sense of urgency. I think the mood is “It’s not over yet.” We lost two games, and we’ve just got to come back with a focus and I think it starts with tonight.

The Trojans haven’t made it past the second round of the NCAA Tournament in over a decade— so how do their odds stack up this year? It’s been a roller coaster of a season for this squad, led by head coach Andy Enfield, but there is a chance this team could make a deep run in the 68-team dance starting in two weeks.
March Madness will look particularly odd this year, and not just because of the abnormal pandemic circumstances forcing teams to play all of their games in one state. The only college basketball dynasties to have eclipsed 2,000 wins— blue blood programs such as Duke, Kansas, Kentucky and UNC— played uncharacteristically mediocre, and in some cases plain bad, basketball this year, resulting in Kansas and UNC at Chapel Hill as the only teams likely to make the tournament as the No. 3 and No. 10 seeds, respectively.  
With the perennial powerhouses of March unlikely to make much of an impact this postseason, the future is brighter and the stakes are higher for teams who aren’t so accustomed to making the tournament. For USC, these circumstances might offer the team the perfect chance to up their program’s reputation on a national stage and make some history.
What the experts predict
Bracketology is not an actual science, yet entire sports analysts’ careers are centered on the subject. What bracketologists predict for the Trojans varies, but all put a notable degree of faith in a team that has seldom had an impact on the national basketball landscape in recent years. 
When USC went on a 7-0 run in early February it earned its highest tournament projection as a No. 4 seed. However, the team’s recent downward trend shifted its national narrative. 
The Pac-12 has struggled to establish national relevancy in college hoops this year, and USC’s recent slate of losses marred its chances at a high seed that would’ve likely provided the team an easier route through the tournament’s early rounds.
CBS Sports’ Jerry Palm most recently projected the Trojans as a No. 7 seed. As a No. 7 seed, the Trojans would match up in the first round against a No. 10 seed. Historically, No. 10 teams have a weaker win rate, but in the last tournament played, only one No. 7 made it past the first round of the tournament. 
Even if USC survives a potentially bracket-busting first round, they’ll face a rough road to the Sweet 16. The Trojans would possibly have to go through a No. 2 seed and No. 3 seed to see the quarterfinals, and this program doesn’t have a favorable history when it comes to nationally ranked contenders. 
ESPN’s college basketball analyst Joe Lunardi had a more favorable outlook on USC’s postseason positioning, but only as a No. 6 seed. No one will forget Loyola-Marymount’s 11th-seeded run to the final four — that all started with a defeat over then No. 6 Miami. Overall, this first round matchup has historically proven to be pretty volatile, with 37.1% ending in upsets since 1985. 
Even if the Trojans make it past the first round they will still have their work cut out for them, with possible games against current No. 11 Florida-State and a dominant current No. 8 Alabama. With all of these threats awaiting the Trojans no matter where they are seeded, the momentum going into this tournament will prove to be key in what could be a program-defining run.
USC’s Key Players
These last two weeks have proven freshman forward Evan Mobley cannot single-handedly carry this team to victories, even in the Pac-12. If the Trojans look to stand a chance in the big 
dance, it’s time to tap into their talented roster. 
Against Utah last week, junior guard Drew Peterson was a catalyst — sparking a lackluster offense and racking up 19 points while going 8-15 from the field. His overall scoring average might not reflect it, but Peterson has the talent and skill necessary to dig USC out of deficits and help the team regain offensive efficiency during scoring slumps.
Redshirt senior guard Tahj Eaddy is this team’s man from beyond the arc. With the most 3-pointers of any Trojan this season, Eaddy gives depth to the offense when Mobley is shut down inside. The guard now consistently puts up double digits for the Trojans, and tapping into his sharp shooting will be necessary to keep up with some of the most efficient offenses in the country.
It all comes down to Saturday
UCLA offers USC one last opportunity to establish some momentum heading into the postseason. The Trojans’ dominant win against Stanford Wednesday night was just what USC needed to keep its Pac-12 title chances alive. USC held the Trees to just 25% shooting, an impressive defensive outing that could serve as a blueprint on Saturday.
UCLA runs an efficient offense, but their Wednesday night loss to Oregon proved the Bruins can crumble under tight defensive pressure. The Trojans may have snapped out of their late-season lull at just the right moment to face their crosstown rival, and a win on Saturday can propel this team to its first regular season conference title since 1985.

The shot clock was ticking in the first quarter, the ball kept moving, Stanford’s players were cutting, but there was nowhere to go. USC’s defenders were planted, swinging toward the open spot like a door, ready to contest a shot. 
Seconds later, the shot clock went off, sending a deafening tone throughout Galen Center. The Trojans’ defense had forced the Cardinal to commit a shot clock violation, and USC’s bench exploded while Stanford’s collapsed.
It was the story of the game, as USC dominated from the start for a much-needed 79-42 victory Wednesday night at Galen Center. 
After losing back-to-back games for the first time this season, the Trojans came out with a vengeance. 
“I thought it was very important for us to get off to a good start defensively tonight,” said head coach Andy Enfield  in a virtual press conference. “[During] the road trip, we were very tired, we just didn’t have the normal energy we’ve had most of the season … It was very important for us to get off to a good start defensively and keep that momentum throughout the game.”
And it’s exactly what USC did, holding Stanford to only three points and one field goal during the game’s first 12 minutes. The Cardinal’s third field goal of the half did not come until the four-minute mark with the Trojans already up 25-8. USC also controlled the paint in the first half with 22 points compared to Stanford’s 4. 
USC suffocated the perimeter and rotated all across the court — holding Stanford to uncomfortably long possessions numerous times. They dove for loose balls and made the extra effort for rebounds, eliminating any hope of a Cardinal comeback. 
After lacking on the defensive end for the last two games, the Trojans’ length and energy were on full display throughout the night, holding Stanford to only 25.4% shooting from the field and 16 turnovers for the game. 
The Trojans also outrebounded the Cardinals 45-27 — they’ve outrebounded their opponent in each of their 20 wins this season.
No player on Stanford scored in double-figures. 
“They were talking, they made the right switches … we played the ball screens a little differently and then we rebounded the ball,” Enfield said. “I thought it was a complete effort [defensively].”
The Trojans were led by an all-around performance by junior guard Drew Peterson, who had 15 points, nine rebounds, six assists and two steals. Redshirt senior guard Tahj Eaddy had a game-high 16 points. Freshman forward Evan Mobley added 10 points, eight rebounds and two blocks.
Peterson, who was benched last week, received praise from Enfield for his performance after the game.
“He’s a very good basketball player,” Enfield said. “He went into a little slump. He’s out of that slump now, which is great for us because he’s playing at a high level. I think he showed his versatility tonight and a variety of things he can do on the floor.”
With the game in the refrigerator early on, Enfield gave the USC bench extended running time. Every active player on the roster logged minutes. 
Notching their 20th win of the season also meant Enfield now has 20 victories in five of his six seasons at USC. The Trojans also still have a chance to win the Pac-12 championship.
However, with Oregon beating UCLA prior to tip-off Wednesday night, things have become complicated. Since Oregon has the best win-percentage in the Pac-12, USC will now have to beat the Bruins Saturday and hope Oregon State can beat the Ducks on Sunday to clinch the title.
The Trojans will have one more obstacle to face when they close out their regular season against UCLA at Pauley Pavilion Saturday. Tip-off is at 1 p.m.

March is where winners are made in college basketball and throughout the decades USC has been full of them. 
NBA champions and coaching legends have worn the cardinal and gold. However, there are only a select few that stand out among the rest.
As the Trojans prepare to face UCLA Saturday, it’s only right that we take a look back at some of the best to lace it up at USC.
Harold Miner
In 1992, where college basketball stars included Duke’s Christian Laettner, LSU’s Shaquille O’Neal and Georgetown’s Alonzo Mourning, another man was chosen as the Sports Illustrated College Basketball Player of the Year.
His name? Harold Miner. 
The 6-foot-5 guard from Inglewood enjoyed an illustrious career at USC where he was voted to the All-Pac-10 first-team three times and named Pac-10 player of the year in 1992. He’s the most decorated and talented Trojan of all time.  
Averaging 23.5 points per game over his three seasons, Miner was nicknamed “Baby Jordan.” He even wore the number 23.
Miner was the most explosive player in the country when he was a Trojan. Shifting through defenses with low and agile dribbling compared to the Harlem Globetrotters, Miner frequently tricked defenders into reaching for the ball, which often resulted in a blow-by and a flight toward the basket for a thunderous finish. 
In his final season at USC, he averaged a whopping 26.3 points per game on 47% shooting — the seventh-highest average in the entire country and highest in the Pac-10. He also led the Trojans to a No. 2 seed in March Madness, the highest seed USC has ever received.
Even though Miner’s NBA career was short-lived, he still won himself a pair of NBA Slam Dunk contests, and he’ll always be known as the best basketball player ever at USC. 
Paul Westphal
The 1970s were the precursor to the basketball boom of the 1980s. However, even though the decade is not as frequently discussed as the one that followed, it would be a shame not to mention the legendary Paul Westphal on this list.
Westphal’s three seasons at USC were dominated by UCLA’s excellence in the country, but he was able to bring the Trojans to college basketball relevance despite UCLA’s dominance. 
During USC’s 1971 season, Westphal averaged 16 points per game and led the Trojans to a 24-2 record. At the time, this was a school record for wins and is still the highest win percentage for a single USC season of all-time.
Westphal also led the Trojans in scoring in his final season, averaging 20 points per game during a loaded conference. He was also an All-American first-team guard and three-time letterman. 
The late great Westphal will forever be remembered as the Godfather of USC basketball. 
DeMar DeRozan
Even though the Compton guard only played one season for the Trojans, his impact cannot be understated. He was part of a USC campaign that saw them win the Pac-10 tournament in dramatic fashion. 
A highflying forward, DeRozan is the epitome of a shooting guard: able to drain a mid-range jumper over a defender or slash to the hoop for a finish. As a freshman, he was the third-leading scorer on the team, averaging 13.9 points per game and 5.7 rebounds per game.
His play during the Pac-10 tournament, however, was the stuff of legends. DeRozan was named the MVP of the tournament after averaging 21 points per game and nine rebounds per game.
In the final game of the conference tournament against Arizona State, DeRozan led the Trojans back from a 15 point deficit at halftime, storming back to win the game by 3. He dropped 25 points while shooting 62% from the field to close out the 24-9 Sun Devils. 
It was a performance that was a prequel to DeRozan’s extremely successful NBA career. His tenure at USC brought the program back on the map after a slew of sub-par seasons.
Bill Sharman
Just like how Paul Westphal can be considered the Godfather of USC basketball, Bill Sharman was the Vito Corleone to Westphal’s Michael Corleone. Without him, Trojan basketball may have never gained traction in the 60s and 70s. 
Sharman was the first big name to play with the Trojans in the late 1940s, during an era where the Pac-12, then known as Pacific Coast Conference, was dominated by UCLA and Washington State. He made USC relevant among powerhouses, showing that the program could compete with the best teams in college basketball. 
The Trojans held positive records in three of his four years. By the time Sharman was in his senior year, USC had a 16-8 record — second in the PCC south. 
A first-team All-American in his final season, Sharman shined, putting up 18 points per game. He was also on the All-Pac-12 team twice and a Consensus All-American. 
At the next level, Sharman won four championships with the Boston Celtics as a player, and won a championship with the Los Angeles Lakers as a coach. He is one of four to be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as a player and a coach.
Sharman’s impact on USC basketball cannot be overstated — he is one of just four people to be named a Naismith Basketball Hall-of-Famer as both a player and coach —  and he’ll always be known as the building block of the program.
Evan Mobley
Evan Mobley’s spot on this list might be a surprise and could be attributed to recency bias, since the forward is in the midst of a season right now. But what is no surprise is the immense talent and potential Mobley possesses — talent and potential that might make him USC’s best center of all time.
What Mobley lacks in accolades or games played he makes up with his sheer ability on the court. He’s got the complete offensive package — he can post up, handle the ball, shoot the three and mid-range — and is a force on the defensive end.
In terms of talent, Mobley’s one of the five-best players USC fans have ever seen, and that cannot be denied. The freshman is currently averaging 16.4 points per game, 8.5 rebounds per game and nearly 2.9 blocks per game. He also currently has more blocks himself than three other Pac-12 teams. 
Even though he still has some time to pan out in the NBA, Mobley has shown he’s worthy of being considered one of the five best to ever play at USC. 
Honorable mentions
Tex Winter — a member of the USC Athletic Hall of Fame and NBA Hall of Fame, his impact on the game of basketball has reached millions across the country. He was the innovator of the famed “Triangle Offense,” and, without Winter, the game might have never 
evolved to what it is today. At USC, he was a multi-sport athlete and described as the “Most Inspirational Player,” on the 1947 team that went 10-14.  
O.J. Mayo — The extravagant 6-foot-5 guard entered USC as the No. 3 ranked player in the country, and he proved it on the court. A 20 point per game scorer in his lone season at USC, Mayo was part of the Pac-10 All-Freshman, All-Pac-10 and Pac-10 tournament team. He also led the Trojans to an appearance in March Madness. 
Sam Clancy — Over the course of four years, Clancy built himself as one of the best forwards in the country. A consistent scorer, he rounded out his collegiate career by being named the Pac-10 player of the year his senior year. Clancy led the Trojans to a 22-10 record and a spot in March Madness while averaging 19 points per game and 9 rebounds per game. The big man was also a Consensus All-American and MVP of the 2002 Pac-10 tournament. 
Taj Gibson — Similar to Clancy, Gibson became a staple of USC basketball after his three years in the cardinal and gold. In his final season, the junior forward led the team in rebounding (9.0) and blocks (2.9) while being second in scoring (14.3). Gibson was an outstanding defender, voted twice to the All-Pac-10 defensive team and the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year his final season.

USC gears up to close out the season against UCLA on Saturday at Pauley Pavilion, a rivalry game that could end up deciding the Pac-12 regular season champion. After UCLA’s loss to Oregon Wednesday night, the Trojans’ title hopes continue to hang by a thread. They need a win in their final game and an Oregon State upset over Oregon Sunday to regain the top spot in the conference. 
“I think we’re right there,”  head coach Andy Enfield said. “We’ve got a game on Saturday to worry about and that’s it. We can’t control anything else. We’re just going to focus on what we can control, and that is to prepare as best we can and play as hard as we can.”
Coming off of two consecutive deflating losses on the road to Colorado and Utah, the Trojans were able to get some rest and bounce back against Stanford in a dominant 79-42 win Wednesday night at Galen Center. 
“We were just flat out exhausted after four games in a week when we went on that long trip,” Enfield said. “Our guys had nothing left by the time we came back. It was nice to take a day off then [have] two really good days of practice to prepare for [Stanford].” 
The road trip was the first time USC had lost consecutive games this season, and the team was focused on getting back on track to close out the campaign.
“March is here,” redshirt senior Chevez Goodwin said. “This is the time of year where [it’s] make or break. If you lose, you go home. We had to get back on track and go into tournament play with a lot of confidence and positive energy.” 
UCLA is undefeated at home this season with a notable win over Colorado, a team that has played spoiler to both USC and UCLA’s title bids. Their biggest producers have been sophomore guard Johnny Juzang and senior guard Chris Smith, who have averaged 14.2 and 12.6 points per game on the season, respectively.
“Offensively, they’ve been dangerous all season,” Enfield said. “They can score at every position. All five guys on the court can score the ball. It’s going to be a very challenging game for us to go into Pauley Pavilion and try to win, but we’ll give it our best shot.” 
The Trojans ran wild last time they played  against the Bruins in a 66-48 win Feb. 6 at Galen Center. Guard play carried USC rather than UCLA, with sophomore guard Ethan Anderson and redshirt senior guard Tahj Eaddy scoring 19 and 16 points, respectively. 
Eaddy’s individual success on a game-to-game basis dictates the pace of USC’s play, as he’s had big performances against the likes of Oregon and UCLA, two games that USC dominated in. The converse is true as well, as USC’s struggles have correlated with Eaddy’s shooting slumps, such as the team’s most recent loss to Utah, where he shot 2-10 from the field with just four points.
“He showed his leadership [against Stanford],” Enfield said. “He had a couple of off games, and I thought it was very important for him to get back to playing like that all-conference guard he’s been the whole season.”
With the final game of the regular season awaiting them, the Trojans will have one more shot to make a grab at the top spot in the Pac-12. 
“We’re so impressed with our young men,” Enfield said. “To come together with a brand new team and to have 20 wins right now is a credit to how our players have played together and have had that energy and spirit. We understand that we have a huge game on Saturday, and then we have a big week the following week, and an even bigger week after that. Our season’s not done.”

With LeBron James captaining the ship and Anthony Davis at the helm, the Los Angeles Lakers cruised to an NBA championship last season. The duo proved to be too much of a handful, as the Purple and Gold came up short in just five playoff games before putting a ring on its finger. 
This time around, it won’t be that easy. No one will hand the Lakers the Larry O’Brien trophy; this season, they’re going to have to earn it. Let’s take a look at the two most menacing opponents that stand in the way of the Lakers and an 18th title banner in STAPLES Center. 
Brooklyn Nets
 In the NBA playoffs, when the clock is ticking and every possession feels like life or death, you need players that can go and get you buckets. Referees let ticky-tacky fouls go, defenses are ultra-focused and coaches are on high alert, constantly mulling over game plans, rotations and matchups.
Players who can create space to knock down jumpers in their defender’s grill, or attack the paint and put pressure on the rim, are the ones that excel in these high-pressure situations. Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving are all playoff-proven scorers — we have watched them hit shot after shot in postseasons over the last decade. 
Now, the trio has found their way to Brooklyn, putting up a 5-1 record when all three professional scorers are on the court. They seem to have a willingness to take a backseat for each other, which begs the question: Can these guys lose four out of seven times in a playoff series?
If they were even average defensively, the Nets would be unbeatable. Unfortunately, they can’t guard a chair, posting the fifth-worst defensive rating in the league. 
The stunning part about this Nets team is that their dreadful defense might not even matter, due to the elite shot creation that Harden, Irving and Durant bring to the table. You could even throw me out there with them, and we might survive because of the overwhelming talent of that three-headed monster.
Los Angeles Clippers
 Throughout last season, the matchup between the Lakers and Clippers — the Battle of L.A., the Fight for STAPLES Center — generated droves of excitement in the NBA world. The Lakers took care of business against the Rockets to advance to the Western Conference Finals, where they eagerly awaited the Clippers, up 3-1 against the Denver Nuggets. 
Boom. Cue the Clippers implosion. Up double digits in all three close-out games, neither Kawhi Leonard nor Paul George stepped up to the plate and knocked the Nuggets out of the park. Instead, the Clippers let them hang around, until suddenly, Paul George found himself throwing corner threes off the side of the backboard, with Kawhi Leonard unable to put the clamps on the Nuggets star Jamal Murray. 
This season, the Clippers are out to give NBA fans what they deserved — a seven-game showdown between the two L.A. giants. After being the laughingstock of the league during the offseason, Leonard and George came out guns-blazing to open the season, scoring efficiently from all three levels of the court — at the rim, in the midrange and beyond the arc. 
The same issue still exists for the Clippers. Who is going to put the dagger in their opponent’s heart when it’s crunch time? This season, in the clutch, the Clippers are 30th in defensive rating, 29th in field goal percentage and 20th in win percentage. When the going gets tough and they need a clutch bucket or a defensive stop, PG-13 and the Klaw aren’t acting like superstars. 
For the Clippers, it almost feels as if they have to win this NBA championship. After the humiliating meltdown against the Nuggets, it’s hard to believe Kawhi Leonard and Paul George won’t do everything in their power to put that in the past. What better way to do that than to dethrone the reigning champs in their own home?
The Nets and Clippers are just two of many teams the Lakers need to keep their eye on. It’s been a few years since we’ve seen this type of parity across the league — there is no looming Cavaliers-Warriors-esque matchup that we saw for four years straight. 
With no overwhelming favorite, any team could win this condensed marathon of a season, knocking the Lakers off the road to repeat.

USC baseball will host Cal State Fullerton Friday, Pepperdine Saturday and will travel to No. 8 UCLA Sunday as a part of the Southern California College Baseball Classic. 
USC will co-host the classic with UCLA. Formerly known as the Dodger Stadium classic, the tournament moved to USC’s Dedeaux Field and UCLA’s Jackie Robinson Stadium last year due to stadium renovations. 
In last year’s Southern California College Baseball Classic USC won their first two games 2-1 against the then-defending national champions Vanderbilt, and TCU. They then suffered a 15-3 blowout loss to UCLA in their third game. 
The Trojans enter the classic with a 3-3 record after losing their second series of the season 2-1 against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo last weekend. 
USC lost their first game of the series against Cal Poly Friday 2-1 and struggled during their second game Saturday in a 9-4 loss. 
On Sunday, the Trojans came out strong, going up 6-0 after the first two innings. As USC’s offense slowed down, the defense struggled to keep the lead, allowing Cal Poly to cut their deficit to 7-4 after the seventh inning. USC’s defense held on at the end of the game, holding the Mustangs to only one run in each of the last two innings to secure the win. 
The win was important for the Trojans confidence after not having a fall season and just getting back into competitive play. 
“I think getting that win gives us a little more positive thinking going into this week and going into the work week before this upcoming weekend,” redshirt junior infielder Ben Ramirez said.   
Head coach Jason Gill felt that the defense was the main issue for USC both in their losses and on Sunday allowing Cal Poly to make such a big comeback. 
“The guys we have out there are capable, we just aren’t very confident defensively,” Gill said. “It’s our defense in all this stuff that has really been a problem for us so far.” 
Ramirez agreed with his coach. 
“I think we are still just working out some kinks with our defense and with our mindset,” Ramirez said. “So I think as the season goes on and we play more games and get more used to the team we have right here, I think we are going to be better for sure.”
Gill took a different approach to practice this week in order to try and fix the defense and confidence issues. 
“We are going to run some stuff, probably some old school stuff that I haven’t done in a while to get these guys confident and get them playing a better game of catch,” Gill said. “We are going to go to the drawing board and figure out this defense; we need to by this Friday for sure.” 
Gill and company will look to redeem themselves against Cal State Fullerton at 5 p.m. Friday at Dedeaux Field.

With the Zoom premiere of “Almost, Maine,” the theater community can rest assured that the era of live theater as we know it is far from over.
Those who dwell within the theater realm seem to constantly produce new material despite the infectious irritation of remaining isolated from one another. But for “Almost, Maine” director Vitória Vasconcellos and producer Nicole McCullough, who are both USC alumnae, the timelessness of the piece is perfectly suited for this current era of seclusion.
Like most of the community, Vasconcellos and McCullough fell into the rabbit hole of theater through discovering their love for acting and film.
Vasconcellos has always considered herself an actor before anything else, but also discovered a love for writing short films when she became a film student. Vasconcellos found that she could perform more parts when writing the script herself and, eventually, explored her interest in directing.
“When I say that I’m a filmmaker, it means that film and acting have sort of merged [for me],” Vasconcellos said. “And ‘Almost, Maine’ is a bit of a hybrid of all of that.”
On the other hand, as early as high school, McCullough was torn between her love for acting as well as her love for sports. Eventually, she officially decided to quit the cross country and track teams to have extra time to commit to the school play. In her junior year of high school, McCullough discovered her love for producing by attempting to combine her interest in film and entertainment with her passion for creating a positive social impact, which ultimately became the reason she decided to apply to the School of Cinematic Arts at USC.
“It was kind of in that moment that I made the decision … [to] sacrifice something else I love so that I can do this,” McCullough said. “That was the first time that I had to make that choice.”
Inevitably, Vasconcellos and McCullough’s worlds collided when they met each other for the first time in Delta Kappa Alpha, the cinematic arts fraternity, as two students in SCA. 
Having been friends since the second semester of their freshman year, Vasconcellos approached McCullough with the idea to put on “Almost, Maine” on Zoom. Luckily enough, because of the travel restrictions placed on people arriving from outside of the United States, Vasconcellos, stuck in Brazil, had two months in her schedule when she was completely free to direct the Zoom play.
“I reached out to Nicole in a spontaneous way,” Vasconcellos said. “We had a month and a week to do this … We’ll see what happens!”
“Almost, Maine” is a play by John Cariani that tells a series of loosely strung tales about love and connection, each with a compelling couple at its center. So with the concept having come to fruition, Vasconcellos and McCullough got to work right away. 
Both contacted other actors and creators they knew in hopes of getting them involved with the production. The more people they added to the project, the more real it began to feel to Vasconcellos and McCullough.
“It was supposed to be a project between friends … and really low key,” Vasconcellos said. “But then we made an Instagram account so we could post the link somewhere [and] it just kept growing.”
Like with any typical theatrical performance, however, Vasconcellos and McCullough faced many challenges, especially over Zoom.
“None of us have done a Zoom play,” Vasconcellos said. “Because Zoom is such a work in progress, [there are] transitions between one thing and the other and sometimes the mood completely changes. How are we able to convey this in just a couple of seconds on Zoom?” 
Fortunately, Vasconcellos and McCullough were able to bring in Emely Tario, a junior majoring in mathematics and comparative literature who had prior experience in working on the technical team for USC performances back when live theater was the norm, to oversee their technical Zoom ventures.
“I have seen all the workings of Zoom,” Tario said. “[And] the actors are doing a good job using and understanding this [Zoom] rectangle.” 
To address all of their technical obstacles, Tario helped Vasconcellos and McCullough come up with creative solutions for adapting the piece to the virtual platform.
For instance, in “This Hurts,” Act 1 Scene 3 of the play, the character Marvalyn (portrayed by Alex Punch) hits Steve (portrayed by Ahash Francis) on the head with an ironing board. Using the platform to their advantage, the Zoom rectangles of Punch and Francis are seen alone and placed right next to each other, so the audience is able to see both the perspectives of Marvalyn and Steve at the same time. And through additional camerawork and raw acting, the audience still gets to see Steve be hit on the head.
“Nothing has changed,” Vasconcellos said. “The kissing, the hitting — all the interactions are still there because our actors are extremely hardworking and committed to exploring Zoom.”
Not only were the challenges technical in nature, location and time also played key factors in the obstacles Vasconcellos and McCullough faced in production. But with cast members from all over the globe — from places including Los Angeles, Brazil, Nevada, Mexico, Sri Lanka and Australia — McCullough knew that what they were doing was worth it. 
“The meetings have been tough because our time zones are not very compatible,” McCullough said. “But we’re [all] passionate … and kind to each other.”
In the midst of all of their difficulties, Vasconcellos and McCullough said they were able to see the bright side of putting on the production in the first place.
“This ensemble has really proven to me that we can still convey the true feeling behind theatre,” Vasconcellos said. “The idea of seeing a scene and being transformed by it or letting it transform you still happens over Zoom.”
Setting itself apart from other Zoom productions, “Almost, Maine” will be done completely “live,” as per an executive decision between Vasconcellos and McCullough. All of the actors will be performing in real time, the way it would have been done on stage in-person, while the audience observes from within the meeting room.
“A huge part of the value of theater is the live element of it,” McCullough said. “I think from an audience perspective, you’re watching the story unfold while the actors are also experiencing it unfold. There’s something about … [the] riskiness that is a really fun part of theater. It’s challenging for us to produce, but it will be worth it.”
Putting on the show completely live when quarantine is over and theaters reopen, however, is a completely different story. With the huge emphasis on the theme of human connection throughout the play, Vasconcellos said the story would not be as timely as it would be during quarantine.
“It’s a play about the one thing we’ve been missing this past year, which is human connection,” Vasconcellos said. “Maybe when quarantine is over, the kind of art that people will need to see and experience will be something different.”
Thematic considerations aside, the practicality of switching from one medium to another also becomes a factor.
“I’ve gotten so accustomed to the adjustments [on Zoom],” Tario said. “If I try to put the production on live, I’d be starting from scratch.”
Moving forward, and as film students first, both Vasconcellos and McCullough see themselves working more within their fields in the future.
“[‘Almost, Maine’] really started like an exercise for me,” Vasconcellos said. “I didn’t think I could direct a play. But, I think I’m a better artist because of these people that I’ve worked with in this production.”
Although she sees Zoom productions as a hybrid between film and theater, McCullough claims that Zoom adaptations work until they don’t.
“This play is really unique because it’s an anthology … so this works for Zoom,” McCullough said. “I don’t think all stories would work out for Zoom. [But] I would totally be interested in doing more readings and more things that can capitalize on the benefits of Zoom down the line.”
Whatever the case, Vasconcellos and McCullough have brought to life one of the most relevant pieces of today’s stuck-at-home world. By doing so, people, like the “Almost, Maine” on Zoom team, continue to breathe life into the world of theatre during these uncertain times.
“A lot of ‘Almost, Maine’ is enhanced because of Zoom in a bizarre way,” Vasconcellos said. “I hope that everybody who watches it shares this … discovery … with me.”
“Almost, Maine” premieres live this Saturday, March 6 at noon PST. Zoom link for the performance can be found here.

For the better half of the film, “Moxie” feels like a Twitter thread — if the thread was created late at night, written by someone half-asleep and each new addition veered in a different direction. Directed by Amy Poehler, the film focuses on 16-year-old Vivian (Hadley Robinson), whose desire to find a cause she cares about for her college applications results in the discovery of her mother’s feminist and former riot grrrl past. 
With the help of a new student, Lucy (Alycia Pascual-Peña), Vivian decides to start an anonymous zine titled Moxie! to change her high school’s patriarchal culture. Finally, she’s found a cause to care about.
If it sounds contrived, it mostly is. While promising as a concept, the film feels more like a rant about the patriarchy on Twitter than a strategic movement for justice. 
“Moxie” could serve as an effective PowerPoint introduction to what feminism is and why it’s important. For those who have already studied and thought about the implications of patriarchal values, however, “Moxie” adds nothing particularly new to the discourse. 
This isn’t to say that it’s bad. In fact, in many ways “Moxie” is a high school glimpse at an adult reality. The high school environment is rendered with surprising perspective. 
When Lucy reports a classmate’s sexual harassment of her to the principal, she’s dismissed — the principal doesn’t want to cause trouble, as “harassment,” according to her, is a loaded term. The principal then tells Lucy to reconsider the language. A fellow student is sent home for not “covering up” enough. Male teachers stand up for male students. It’s a much-needed foray into the institutional structures that perpetuate systemic misogyny. 
Lucy, too, is a character whose honesty and willfulness make her infinitely more interesting than Vivian, whose turn to feminism feels slightly inauthentic by comparison. Throughout the film, it’s unclear whether or not Vivian’s motivation for starting a feminist revolution comes solely from her frustration at the patriarchy or her desire to write a good college application essay.
In its depiction of high school, “Moxie” ends up blurring the lines between cringy teenage angst and real, justified discontent at sexism. At times it’s hard to tell whether the film is taking itself seriously by reducing teenage activism to repeatedly and overwhelmingly shouting angry statements about the patriarchy.
In that regard, Vivian’s best friend Claudia (Lauren Tsai) provides a nuanced counter narrative to Vivian’s own involvement in feminism. Claudia is constantly skeptical about what she perceives as the loudness of Vivian’s “revolution,” and to be honest, she’s not at all wrong. 
When Claudia’s Chinese mother refuses to let her come to school wearing a tank top — a key part of Vivian’s feminist plans  — Vivian finds Claudia unsupportive and critical, even though the situation is out of her hands. It’s another example of how even when these cultural differences are spotlighted, they’re still brushed aside for Vivian’s own self-righteousness. 
Overt lines about including women of color are necessary, but ultimately feel performative, as if the film wants to capitalize on the need for intersectionality in the movement without directly addressing it. At the end of the day, the film still caves in to a white feminist understanding of what it means to dismantle the patriarchy.
It’s great that “Moxie” acknowledges Claudia’s point of view, but it’s also odd that the only resort for her at the end is to join the Moxie club and take the blame for Vivian’s involvement in order to protect her from the school’s punishment. Claudia ends up reconciling with her friend only by shouldering the burden for her. 
The most realistic moment in the film is when Vivian visits Claudia’s house after Claudia’s suspension. Vivian doesn’t understand why Claudia decided to indict herself for the Moxie club when it wasn’t even Claudia who started it. Claudia tells her that Vivian shunned her unwillingness to take part in the “rebellion” without understanding her perspective. 
It’s a perspective especially relevant to how intersectional feminism can take shape, as Claudia is the daughter of a Chinese immigrant mother who made sacrifices for her education and didn’t want her to risk the consequences of joining the “rebellion.” 
“You don’t get what’s going on with me because you’re white,” Claudia tells Vivian. It’s probably the most personal and yet sad reality for a girl of color who ends up being one of the most compelling characters in the film. 
“Moxie” is a coming-of-age story that while passionate, bites off more than it can chew. It gets better toward the end, encouraging audiences to come to the revolution it’s started. It’s disheartening, then, that the invitations come a little too late.

The ever-looming and punishing hand of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement is inhumane and anti-BIPOC, to say the least. 
The manner in which arrests, detentions and deportations are carried out targets brown communities in particular, hammering home the notion that danger and criminality can be found associated with skin color. We have seen families separated, forced hysterectomies and some of the poorest access to coronavirus resources in these detention centers. We know and hear stories of those fearing for their lives.
While, yes, we’ve come some way in putting pressure on the system, but abolishing the department altogether is still worth the fight. 
The use of the label “customs enforcement” has given the institution free rein to treat individuals and families as dangerous criminals, suggesting their rights as human beings within the care of the United States are forfeited — which is simply not the case. The blanket purpose of dealing with and preventing illegal immigration does not justify the significant human rights violations that ICE has carried out. 
I had the great privilege of having an avenue to come to this country legally. In the simplest of terms, I got lucky, and I know very well that some individuals aren’t quite so fortunate. However, that doesn’t make them less entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
For me, it was and still is: abolish ICE.
Families deserve to be together. Children should not be made to stand trial alone. Women have a right to their wombs, and people should not be neglected for aspiring to have better lives. 
The system is archaic, discriminatory and profoundly plagued with questions of whether the policies in place are humanly moral. Altogether, we’re talking about how we treat whole demographics of people, and I, for one, am deeply ashamed and frustrated that we have tolerated such atrocities in the name of enforcing our citizenship laws. 
The latest in ICE transgressions have revolved around the block of coronavirus vaccine distribution to undocumented citizens and the shameless defiance of President Joe Biden’s pause on deportations — among many others issues. It has been brought to light that communities of color are presented with greater difficulty in getting their shots, with undocumented citizens being among them. 
For undocumented citizens, the issue becomes two-fold as fears of ICE presence at these sites add to the existing hurdles. 
In response, Biden issued a statement last Friday, urging the department to refrain from interfering. The Department of Homeland Security issued a response, detailing that ICE officers would not be conducting their so-called “enforcement operations” at these sites as a means of encouraging all people to get their vaccinations. 
While this response might be lauded by some, it still does not come away free of the fear mongering ICE enforcement has in all other places around our communities. To clarify that ICE presence would not be felt at these vital health care sites is base-level humanity, and it is by no means apologetic of the aggressive ICE presence everywhere else in the country. 
Moreover, ICE’s continued defiance of Biden’s 100-day halt on deportations cannot be indicative of a department that is true to its word. 
In early February, harsh criticism and general outcry fell upon customs enforcement once more, following the deportation of 72 individuals to Haiti — 21 of which were children. This was directly following a Biden Administration moratorium demanding the pause of expulsions beyond those deemed potentially dangerous — the conditional being dangerously vague in and of itself. 
This undermining act awarded ICE the label of a “rogue” agency, creating greater mistrust between the institution and the American public. 
ICE has had great influence in the immigration policy of this nation. The nature of that influence is controversial at best, but it is uncontested that the nation has given great agency to this department as a whole. 
The agency has been abused and has been used to carry out great crimes against a significant number of human beings. It no longer becomes a political issue, but rather one of human care. 
As vaccinations become more available for some, many are reporting that that is not the case for undocumented individuals. As we begin to think that perhaps there is some hope of mending ICE in a new administration, we hear of the ongoing threat of deportations and realize that the institution is wrought from the desire to criminalize and punish. 
Individuals have bravely shared those stories to give agency back to the people. 
Where our communities are concerned, it’s only right that we push back against this department for its continuing threat to our neighbors. 
As many were, I might assume, I was taught as a child that how you treat others matters. What does it say about us if we are complicit in this system that degrades and dehumanizes those that hold very similar aspirations to our own?
So, yes, it’s still: abolish ICE
