With five years of combined experience under their belt, Andrew Matson and Juan Orjuela are vying for the Undergraduate Student Government’s presidential and vice presidential positions, focusing on meeting students’ short- and long-term needs.
Wealth of experience · Both presidential candidate Andrew Matson (left) and vice presidential candidate Juan Orjuela have been working with USG since their freshmen years. - Scott Fairbanks | Daily Trojan 
Running under the campaign slogan “It’s About You,” Matson, currently USG’s director of academic affairs, and Orjuela, currently a residential senator, list extending Thanksgiving break, providing weekend trams to various Los Angeles destinations, improving the Writing 140 program and expanding the reach of Campus Cruiser as some of their many goals.
Matson said he and Orjuela have taken great care to consider student opinion in developing their goals and platform and will continue to solicit and consider student opinion if they are elected.
“Our overriding theme of the campaign is ‘It’s About You,’” Matson said. “We really want to get [student] feedback in decision making and do things that students care about. That means also advertising better to students so that they know what USG is doing for them so they can take advantage of it.”
One of the biggest impacts Matson and Orjuela hope to have is raising awareness about what programs USG is working on and how students can give input. They hope to increase the contact between students and members of USG, striving to get feedback from students that are traditionally underrepresented, such as Roski School of Fine Arts and international students.
“Polling is one way, but students can get over-polled,” Matson said. “But that’s not the only way … Really, just launching an awareness campaign through both electronic and non-electronic means … We really want to get out of the Trousdale mind-set … it’s essential for us to also get out of the Trousdale area and also get into the underrepresented student areas.”
There are many resources on campus that students would benefit from but are not aware of, Matson said. He hopes that, with the opening of the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center, students will be more aware of how USG can help them.
Academically, Matson said a major problem that USC students face is inadequate interdisciplinary advising. He said there is a definite chasm between what the school encourages students to do and the amount of advisement that the students receive — the university encourages students to double major and minor in different areas but does not provide enough guidance for the students.
“Having interdisciplinary advisors to help is something that I really think needs to be changed,” Matson said. “So that once students get here, they can take advantages of the opportunity that they were promised when they were recruited.”
Another problem Orjuela said he wants to address is the problem of wireless Internet on campus. He was part of the force behind getting wireless in Leavey Library this year and hopes to continue to fortify wireless coverage.
“A really big point in our administration [is] striving to expand wireless everywhere,” Orjuela said. “I think it’s incredible that USC is one of the best universities here in the states and doesn’t have reliable wireless … I think it’s something that students really want and need.”
Both Matson and Orjuela expressed that they have the necessary experience, background, connections and knowledge of how things work within USG and within the greater university. Between the two of them, they have experience in three out of the four branches of student government.
“Me and Juan really exemplify one of the greatest teams of experience that USG will have seen in a long time,” Matson said. “We’ve both been involved in student government organizations since we were freshmen … so we have five years of student government experience here at USC.”
Matson and Orjuela both stressed that their experience will allow them to immediately start implementing policies once elected instead of having to learn about the different policies and protocols.
Also, because USG and Program Board are merging in the new campus center, Matson emphasized that it would be a huge shift in the way both organizations operate. Because he is the only candidate on the Moving and Unity Committee — an internal committee dedicated to smoothing the transition — Matson said he knows exactly what is going on with the transition, insight the other tickets lack.
“We have worked on every aspect of USG,” Orjuela said. “We both know the organization completely … There are tickets where some people still have to learn something that we already know so we can start day one … into accomplishing the goals set forth on our platform.”
Promising to get students more involved with getting what they want and need, Matson and Orjuela emphasized they are not as interested in receiving the title as they are in supporting the USC undergraduates.
“We want to serve the students; that’s why we are here,” Orjuela said.

Across the nation, people are tightening their purse strings and watching their budgets, but that didn’t stop USC faculty members from donating to the Good Neighbors Campaign, which raised more money this year than ever.
Neighborly · A USC student works with a local student through an outreach program that benefits from the Good Neighbors Campaign. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
Begun in 1993 by President Steven B. Sample, the Good Neighbors Campaign is an annual internal fundraising campaign that asks USC faculty and staff to donate a portion of their paychecks to support programs that benefit local communities.
During its 15-year history, the Good Neighbor Campaign has donated over $11 million and supported more than 365 organizations.
This year, while participation rates dropped from 49 percent to 39 percent, the average value of the donations increased, leading to a record-breaking $1.2 million total.
USC University Hospital and USC Norris Cancer Hospital, the two newest members of the Trojan Family, brought in the most donations of any administrative unit with $55,731. The USC Keck School of Medicine raised $124,344, the largest amount of any academic unit.
Cesar Armendariz, director of the Health Sciences Campus Community Outreach, said acquiring two new hospitals this year brought in a new group of donors.
“The Good Neighbors Campaign was a good way for them to feel part of the family and get involved,” he said.
Armendariz also acknowledged Carmen Puliafito, dean of the Keck School of Medicine, for setting the tone for the entire campaign and urging people to participate from the outset.
“He stressed that we should do it and was passionate about the importance of academic leadership in the HSC,” Armendariz said.
As a result, there was a concentrated effort across the board from all different levels — administrators, nurses and doctors. The USC Health Science Campus saw high participation levels, with many employees donating small amounts.
Armendariz said the Good Neighbors Campaign tremendously benefits the local community, and participation and donations from the Health Science Campus will only increase year by year, as people see where the money goes and how it improves the lives of others.
Though participation was down overall, one academic unit — the USC Rossier School of Education — had 100 percent participation. Six additional administrative units also had perfect participation.
Kimberly Hirabayashi, assistant professor of Clinical Education at Rossier and a faculty representative for the Good Neighbors Campaign, said the key to Rossier’s success was fundraising early in the year.
“People are busy, and it is really helpful to start early,” she said. “We encourage people to renew their contribution in August.”
Faculty members at Rossier were also encouraged to participate in weekly events such as silent auctions and bake sales.
Tom Sayles, vice president of government and community relations, came to USC last year and headed the campaign for the first time this year. He said the Good Neighbors Campaign is an exceptional effort.
“No one takes on such a monumental task every year to benefit their neighborhoods,” Sayles said in a press release. “The generosity of the Trojan Family is unprecedented, and, during these tough economic times, this effort speaks volumes about USC’s commitment to improving the lives of our neighbors.”
This year, the money raised will help bring theater, music, fine arts, violence-prevention programs, science and health-education mentoring and counseling to various local schools. These programs allow USC’s diverse academic schools to help local students realize their full potential.

The Los Angeles Police Department and California Highway Patrol will join the USC Department of Public Safety in conducting a sobriety check Saturday night in hopes of catching people who are driving under the influence near campus.
The sobriety and license checkpoint will take place between Jefferson Boulevard and 33rd Street along Figueroa Street between 6 p.m. and 1 a.m.
Each department, including DPS, will contribute some officers to assist in the checkpoint.
According to LAPD officials, 10 officers on motorcycles, two collision investigation officers and one traffic collision sergeant will assist from LAPD’s South Traffic Division. Additionally, 10 officers and one sergeant from the California Highway Patrol Special Operations Unit will be at the checkpoint.
Not all cars will be checked; instead, officers will choose cars at random or will pick those who show signs of driving under the influence. Those drivers who are picked will be subject to a sobriety test and a license check.
DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas said that a checkpoint near campus is important for students’ safety. He cited the death of Adrianna Bachan, a USC freshman who was struck by a hit-and-run driver last March on Jefferson Boulevard. There has been speculation that the driver might have been drunk at the time.
“We went to [the California Highway Patrol] because we’re concerned with what happened to Adrianna Bachan, and we want to make sure people driving under the influence get caught,” Thomas said.
Though the checkpoint will happen near campus, it was up to the Highway Patrol to decide where the checkpoint would take place. Thomas said the Highway Patrol chose a location where they thought they could have the greatest impact.
According to LAPD, 121 drunk driving-related deaths occurred in the Southwest Los Angeles area in 2009, as well as 1,105 hit-and-run traffic collisions.
Some students, such as Paul Hill, a graduate student studying strategic public relations, said this checkpoint shows the school cares about students even when they are off campus.
“It’s good to keep people on their toes and for it to be so close to campus,” Hill said. “It will only be a problem if people are not aware and don’t act accordingly, but it’s good for the community and shows the school cares.”
Ewa Tymoszewska, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering, said this checkpoint is necessary even if it will pose an inconvenience.
“You shouldn’t be drinking and driving,” she said. “It will definitely be annoying, but, if that’s the only way they will stop drinking and driving, why not?”
DPS hopes the checkpoint will help get drunk drivers off the road.
“If you are driving under the influence in this area, you are going to be stopped and arrested,” Thomas said.
Students like Shilpa Rajgopal, a sophomore majoring in civil engineering, said the mere presence of the checkpoint will dissuade intoxicated people from driving, even if it only covers a limited area.
“Driving under the influence is bad, so I don’t have a problem with the checkpoint,” Rajgopal said. “It will discourage people from driving under the influence.”
Thomas hopes students will not see this checkpoint as a hassle but will consider how it will help keep the area safe and take those who should not be driving off the road.
“It’s not meant to target students at all, but, if they are intoxicated, they will be held under the same jurisdiction,” Thomas said.
I sometimes wonder just how effective these points are. Quoting an article from the LAist, 
“On average, 35 officers work the checkpoints. “At least a dozen officers spent hours sitting and chatting at an operation in early January in downtown Los Angeles,” the report stated. “A couple of officers smoked cigars as they watched cars go through the screening. Officers seized 22 cars that evening and made one DUI arrest. The state data shows that last fiscal year LAPD spent $16,200 per checkpoint, all of it on officer overtime,” which is funded by state grants.”
Gee $16.2k  *per checkpoint* How is operating constantly in the red working for you, brokey LA?  Granted that it is a revenue generator for the city, 35 officers is just an exaggeration. Lastly, I agree with CR, there should be a neutral formula with the exception of drivers being blatantly intoxicated, that would eliminate bias.
Oh yeah, and take your checkpoint elsewhere. Slapping one up on Figueroa north of Jefferson on an evening when traffic is particularly heavy has fail written all over it.
i think this is a waste of effort.
I believe the mere presence of safety officers around campus and on the road should deter drunk drivers.
You do not have to go to the extreme of having to check the cars.
besides, majority of USC students that party around campus are walking not driving.
Parking is a b***h!
“Not all cars will be checked; instead, officers will choose cars at random or will pick those who show signs of driving under the influence.”
This is a flagrant violation of the law concerning checkpoints. To quote from Ingersoll v. Palmer, “A related concern is that motorists should not be subject to the unbridled discretion of the officer in the field as to who is to be stopped. Instead, a neutral formula such as every driver or every third, fifth or tenth driver should be employed.”
What these officers are doing is in blatant violation of the court’s guidelines. They should change their policies or be taken to court.
I think that that is a very good idea.
