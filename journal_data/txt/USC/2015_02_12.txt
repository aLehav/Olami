The National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE), a USC-based interdisciplinary research center funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, hosted Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson on Thursday afternoon. Johnson’s speech focused largely on the department’s priorities, including cybersecurity, annual appropriations and the Unity of Effort initiative.
In the months following his swearing-in as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Johnson proposed his Unity of Effort initiative. The goal is to create a more centralized decision-making system at department headquarters.
“Many of our components have been stove-piped, and were bringing in a more coordinated, more strategic approach to homeland security in general,” Johnson said. “The Department of Defense moved into this direction from its birth in 1947 on, and [DHS] want to move in a similar direction.”
The plan to consolidate 22 departments and agencies, formed in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, has — according to Johnson — already identified several department realignments that can be made and inefficiencies that can be eliminated.
“We do not expect the Secret Service to behave like the Coast Guard or TSA to behave like FEMA, but where it counts — budget decisions, acquisition decisions -— we want a more centralized, strategic approach,” Johnson explained of the streamlining approach that has won bipartisan praise in Congress.
Johnson then focused on the topic of cybersecurity and its impact on national security. In the wake of several cyber attacks, including the recent data breach of U.S. insurance giant Anthem, cybersecurity has become an increasingly pressing issue for both the Department of Homeland Security and Congress.
“There is a lot more we need to do. There are attacks daily in the United States on our cyber infrastructure,” Johnson said.
The secretary went on to explain the measures that have already been taken, including legislation passed by Congress last year, to increase cybersecurity.
“We want to promote information sharing with the private sector,” Johnson said, citing the Cyber Information Sharing Act.
The controversial cybersecurity bill is intended to help private companies and the government impede hackers and other illegal system intrusions. The DHS is in the process of making it a requirement to receive notification of private sector data breaches and increasing penalities for cyber crime.
At the end of his talk, Johnson addressed concerns over the current stalemate in Congress that could potentially leave the DHS without funding after Feb. 27.
The DHS runs on an annual budget of $60 billion — $39 billion of which is appropriated by Congress and the rest pooled by department fees and FEMA. Though the House was able to pass a bill for the department’s funding, Democrats refuse to pass it through Senate, and President Obama has threatened to veto it until a “clean” spending bill that does not attack his executive actions on immigration is proposed. If an agreement is not reached by Feb. 27, the DHS will have to use funds left over from the 2014 annual budget and furlough 30,000 jobs, which could make the nation more vulnerable to attacks.
Johnson believes the DHS will receive funding, but is unsure of when Congress will reach an agreement.

More than 5,500 students voted in this year’s Undergraduate Student Government election, falling short of USG’s 7,000 voter target.
The polls closed on Thursday at 8 p.m., culminating a three-week campaigning process and three days of voting.
The election committee would not provide the exact number of students who voted but disclosed that there were approximately 5,500 ballots submitted three hours before the polls closed. They predicted the final total would be close to 6,000.
The numbers are just under last year’s turnout of 6,300.  USG officials have attributed the drop to a change from the four days of voting in previous years to three days this year. The reduction was financially motivated, as each day of voting requires the hosting of a polling area and food trucks, which proved to be a financial burden for USG.
Another factor that might have contributed to the lower turnout was the presence of just two tickets, as opposed to last year’s three, on the ballot this year.
This year’s election also faced online network errors, as some students reported issues when logging in to vote.
Rumors on the number of students hindered by the technical difficulty circulated on campus. The Providence-Ehren presidential ticket posted on its Facebook page that there were 1,000 students locked out of the system. The post was later deleted.
Christine Hennes, USG senior director of communications, verified that a number that large was false, though she doesn’t believe the ticket had bad intentions. Though USG didn’t have an exact number of students affected, Hennes was personally aware of only fewer than 10 who were.
Providence Ilisevich said that the number they posted was incorrect information from someone on their campaign team, and that it wasn’t meant to misinform voters.
“It was just the heat of the moment,” she said.
Those students who were not able to vote were advised to either submit a paper ballot available at the six voting booths on campus or email the USG Election Committee with their student ID and decision. Hennes said that with only 25 paper ballots submitted on Thursday, she was confident that the error did not affect many students.
“Technical difficulties could have contributed to a small number of votes being lost due to people not taking their own responsibility to vote on a paper ballot,” she said “But overall, I don’t think was a [major] issue.”
The error, though, did prove to be a slight challenge for the two tickets, as both of them shared that a handful of students reached out to them on social media about being unable to vote.
“Right now I’m just trying to save those individuals who couldn’t log on,” Sampath said. “It’s so nerve-wracking, especially with how long and hard we’ve been working, to know that there’s issues with the system.”
Overall, however, Hennes stressed that the elections proved to be a positive week.
“I think it was really successful,” she said. “Logistically everything went very smoothly this year, and we were really happy with the activism and support from both tickets.”

University Gateway Apartments is facing a unique problem in Los Angeles: too many parking spaces.
The Los Angeles City Planning Commission unanimously approved University Gateway Apartments’ proposed plan to alter the parking arrangements for its residents and to rezone their on-site parking spaces at a public hearing on Feb. 12.
Parking statistics that were gathered by University Gateway management and presented to commissioners stated there are 89 surplus spaces for the on-site residential parking, 163 surplus spaces for the on-site non-residential parking, and 410 surplus spaces of the 440 reserved spaces at the University Parking Center on 35th Street and Grand Avenue, an off-site location located a quarter mile away from the complex.
University Gateway’s on-site parking structure is eight floors, with four for commercial use and four for residents. The statistics showed that parking is not in high demand for University Gateway residents at a time when other forms of transportation are more popular at USC.
The complex proposed rezoning 354 on-site parking spaces into shared parking spaces to be used by both commercial visitors and residents. This rezoning would accommodate current and future increases in residential and commercial parking demand.
Currently, University Gateway offers a total of 1,215 parking spaces for residential and commercial use. Seven hundred seventy-five spaces are located on-site — 327 commercial space, 27 residential guest spaces, 421 residential spaces — and 440 spaces are located at the off-site UPC. Reserved residential parking at the UPC is offered at $38 a month, and parking at University Gateway’s on-site parking structure is offered at $175 a month.
Despite the less expensive price of UPC parking, University Gateway representatives made it clear that the parking spaces were not being used to their full capacity.
“All parking spaces for the project are operating with surplus parking spaces,” said Katherine Casey, the main representative for University Gateway at the hearing.
University Gateway’s management proposed eliminating the parking spaces for residents at UPC. Commissioner Renee Dake Wilson spoke in favor of approving University Gateway’s proposal.
“Los Angeles has 6.4 parking spaces for every car,” Wilson said. “Let’s free up that unused land for cars that do need to use this.”
University Gateway representatives and community members attended the hearing at Los Angeles City Hall to voice their opinions to commissioners.
Operated and managed by Wilson University Gateway, LLC, University Gateway began leasing 421 residential units to USC students in fall 2010. The multi-story complex is located at the intersection of Jefferson and Figueroa, a block away from the Jefferson/USC Metro station and across the street from the Galen Center.
Besides student housing, University Gateway also leases out 74,516 square feet of street-side retail space to several food and beverage outlets such as Yogurtland, Subway and convenience stores like Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market. These stores have boosted the foot traffic around the Gateway complex, attracting both the USC and University Park community.
Casey emphasized that the apartments are marked by their proximity to local transportation.
“The project site is located in a transit-rich area … Metro operates several bus lines in the area,” she said.
With her PowerPoint presentation on the University Gateway project and its parking statistics, Casey made her point to commissioners that several of the residential parking spaces were not being utilized completely because of the convenience of University Gateway’s location and its proximity to alternative forms of transportation such as Metro, Uber, and Zipcar that don’t cost as much money as a car.
“Most students at USC utilize other methods of transportation, with biking being the most popular,” Casey said.
Lisa Patricio, another supporter of the rezoning who spoke at hearing, also agreed by informing commissioners that the various methods of public transportation available around the apartments lessens the need for cars.
“It seems the transit is working at getting people outside their cars,” Patricio said.
Both Patricio and Casey pointed out to commissioners that bikes are the most popular form of transportation for USC students.
Considering the popularity of bicycle use, Commissioner Marta Segura unofficially advised University Gateway representatives to add more bicycle parking spaces both inside and outside of the Gateway complex to accommodate the increased traffic in that particular area of University Park.
All commissioners found no reason to reject University Gateway’s plan and only very minor complaints were heard in the public hearing. The commissioners of the City Planning Commission then unanimously approved the parking restructuring plan.
“‘The project site is located in a transit-rich area … Metro operates several bus lines in the area,’ she said.”
Well… many neighborhoods are served by multiple bus lines. However, what truly makes the project site “transit rich” is its one-block proximity to a Metro station; something that’s not (yet!) as common in Los Angeles.

Since I seem to spend a relatively little amount of my time in London actually attending my university (classes are only two hours a week each), I decided to spend my Friday at another famous university — Cambridge.
Probably partially because England is such a small country, there are a ton of great day trips just a short train ride away from London. I have a whole list of places I want to go on the weekends that I’m in town and Cambridge was near the top (likely because I’ve seen it in so many recent movies — The Theory of Everything and The Imitation Game, anyone?).
So, on Friday a group of eight of us set out for the town in the late morning (train tickets are way more expensive during rush hour so we decided to sleep in and save some pounds). After about an hour-and-a-half trip, we arrived at the edge of Cambridge and set off to get some lunch.
Cambridge is truly a college town in a way most U.S. college town aren’t. Instead of a campus and with an adjacent city center, Cambridge is kind of both the university and the town all meshed together. Add a bunch of tourists to the mix of students and residents who live there and you have quite an interesting group of people milling around the city.
The town itself is full of adorable little shops with colleges randomly sprinkled throughout. How the university works is you attend one of 31 “colleges,” which you live at, but classes are a mishmosh of everyone. The colleges differ on reputation and how big/famous/rich/old they are.
After walking through town, three of us just stopped to quickly grab some sandwiches and continue exploring. We wandered toward some large, pretty buildings, with a sign outside that said St. John’s College and decided to have a peek in.
Unfortunately, the place charged admission, so we pretended to be students there (it’s not that far from the truth) and snuck in through a side entrance.
The college was incredible. I love USC, but it’s got nothing on Cambridge. St. John’s dormitory alone is more impressive than any building on our campus.
After walking around a bit we met up with the rest of our group to take a punt on the River Cam (which has a lot of bridges, hence Cam-bridge. Punting is an outdated way of getting around in which a punter propels a small, flat-bottomed boat using a pole. It’s still big at Oxford and Cambridge, especially in the summer when it’s nice out. While I can’t say it was a nice temperature out when we were there (it was freezing), the sun was out and the sky was clear. Our punter showed us seven of the major colleges in Cambridge located on the river and filled us in out a lot of the university’s history and famous alum during our ride. Way better than a normal tour if you ask me.
After our punt we desperately needed to warm up so we stopped in a cafe for a spot of tea before attending evensong at King’s College Chapel, the most famous of Cambridge’s chapels (each school has its own). One thing I’ve discovered about famous churches/chapels/abbeys in England is that while they might charge admission during most of the day, they can’t very well expect people to pay to attend services so they’re free at those times.
And though I’m not Christian, it’s cool to experience a building when it’s being used for its intended purpose. This was true at King’s College Chapel. Walking into the building with its amazingly intricate stained glass windows was gorgeous, and this was only enhanced by the beautiful melodies sung by the choir, who I believe were all students in the college. I guess we have a capella groups, they have church choirs.
We ended our day in true English fashion: enjoying ciders in a pub. In addition to chapels, if there’s one thing Cambridge isn’t hurting for, it’s pubs which line many of the blocks of the town along with shops and cafes. This might really be heaven.

The Trojans return to Dedeaux Field this weekend to kick off a promising season with one of the most experienced and skilled teams in recent years, consisting of 19 upperclassmen and seven returning starters.
USC hopes to continue the positive trend set last season, in which they narrowly missed the NCAA Regionals and finished with a 29-24 record, the first time the team had finished with a winning record since 2005.
Though the Trojans still boast many of their key players from last season, the team lost four players who were instrumental to the team’s success: pitcher Wyatt Strahan, pitcher Bob Wheatley, infielder Kevin Swick and catcher Jake Hernandez.
Despite the absence of these impact players, head coach Dan Hubbs, now entering his third year, believes the remaining players’ flexibility in skill and position will allow for those holes in the lineup to be easily filled.
“We have some great players, especially on our staff, who are ready to move from bullpen pitchers and step up to fill in the roles of Strahan and Wheatley,” Hubbs said. “We’re confident that with the guys we’ve got stepping into the roles of catcher and other infield positions that the new guys will be just as good as their predecessors, if not better.”
To further help assimilate the Trojans into their new roles, many of the players have spent the off-season bonding as a team, discussing fixable problems from last season and seeking advice from their teammates as they transition into new positions or roles within the lineup.
Junior pitcher Kyle Twomey, who recorded an ERA of 3.11 in 55 innings pitched during the 2014 season, explained how the Trojans have assisted one another throughout the preseason.
“It’s really important that we as a team help one another and give good advice so we’re ready and good to go for the first couple series of the season,” Twomey said. “For example, I was in the bullpen last year, so [junior pitcher] Marc Hubberman talked to me about the seventh and eighth inning role I had last year. That type of communication is really key to getting guys comfortable with what it’s going to be like this weekend when the lights come on and it starts to count.”
Hubbs believes the team’s hard work in the preseason will help ensure more consistency and improvement from the 2015 season.
“I think the kids came back in the fall with the mindset that they weren’t gonna let anything come up to circumstance or chance or leave it to the hands of the committee to decided whether we go to the playoffs,” Hubbs said. “I think we’ve seen in practice much more intensity in terms of getting things done and making sure we’re ready to win games in a bunch of different ways.”
Senior catcher Garrett Stubbs, junior pitchers Kyle Davis and Twomey and sophomore catcher Jeremy Martinez highlight the 2015 squad.
Nine freshmen also join the team this season, along with two impact junior college transfers in pitcher Tyler Gilbert and outfielder David Oppenheim.
Sizing up the 2015 Trojans in terms of skill and ability, Twomey predicts that pitching will be the team’s greatest strength.
“As of right now, we have five guys who can fill a starting role and we’re also going to be pretty strong at the back end of the game relieving wise because there are a couple of guys who are really ready to fill those roles of coming in late and closing games out right,” Twomey said.
Hubbs thinks that while pitching and defense up the middle of the field will likely be the team’s greatest strengths, the offensive game will see a great deal of  improvement from last year.
“I really believe we’re going to see a lot more home runs and doubles with this team,” Hubbs said. “I think we have more team speed offensively, which we didn’t have last year.  We should be able to score more runs and run the bases more aggressively, as opposed to last year when we primarily just had to rely on the big hit.”
The Trojans open the 2015 season tonight at Dedeaux Field against the Towson Tigers who were 22-25 overall in 2014, but 6-17 on the road.
The team is led by head coach Mike Gottlieb and senior shortstop Peter Bowles. This will be the first meeting in series history between the Trojans and the Tigers.
Looking forward, the Trojans begin the season with  non-Pac- 12 match ups with Cal State Fullerton, Kentucky and Oakland next week.
Overall the schedule consists of 24 out of 56 games against 11 different teams that made the 2014 NCAA postseason.
Additionally, this year’s schedule includes games against three teams that made the 2014 College World Series, and a nonconference series against 2014 regional team Cal Poly.
Despite this season’s difficult schedule, the Trojans feel confident that as long as they execute appropriately, they should start off the season on a high note.
“I think especially just the first couple of weeks its important to just play fundamental baseball and keep it clean cut and continue what we’ve been trying to do all fall and spring,” Twomey said. “I think once we get that down well be able to excel as the season moves forward.”

It’s official, true believers! After years of inter-studio scuttlebutt and fanboy dream weaving, Spider-Man is finally wall-crawling his way into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Late this past Monday, Sony Pictures, which has controlled the big screen rights to Spider-Man since 1999,  announced its plans to lease the character to Disney’s Marvel Studios for several new films, including a pivotal role in the upcoming Captain America: Civil War and the third and fourth installments of the hugely successful Avengers franchise.  Sony will also continue producing solo adventures for the web-head, including one currently slated for 2017.  The fate of Drew Goddard’s super-villain team-up flick The Sinister Six, meanwhile, remains unknown at this time.
News of the deal has been rapturously received by the majority of Spidey fans, particularly those who were left unsatisfied by last year’s The Amazing Spider-Man 2, a generic, unfocused muddle that sidelined the terrific chemistry between stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone in favor of too many villains, convoluted subplots and a fatal over-reliance on slapdash CGI. The bulk of the excitement, however, stems from the realm of pure geek wish fulfillment: the chance to witness Spider-Man share the screen with other Marvel heroes — including his fellow Avengers — for the first time in cinematic history.
Now that we know Marvel Studios head honcho Kevin Feige and his creative team are being brought in to help former Sony head-turned-producer Amy Pascal shape the future of the wisecracking web-slinger and the $4 billion franchise he represents, what should that future look like?
First and foremost, let’s cool it with Spidey’s origin, which was already revisited in the first Amazing Spider-Man back in 2012. There are only so many times we can wince as that radioactive spider lands on Peter Parker’s arm or sniffle as poor Uncle Ben gets gunned down. These plot points should be considered common knowledge by now. Show us something new, already!
Second, as much as it pains me, Marvel is going to have to recast Spider-Man. Garfield’s Peter might have come off as too smooth and self-assured at times — making him a skateboarding Coldplay fan with Edward Cullen hair might have been a mistake in hindsight — but his playful, quip-spouting Spidey felt like a spot-on interpretation of the character, a bashful nerd who transforms into a freewheeling insult comic the second he slips on the spandex. Garfield is a fantastic actor, and he’d probably be happy to continue in the role that allowed him to live out his childhood dream, but Marvel reportedly wants a high school-aged Spidey, and the 31-year-old simply no longer looks the part.
So who could replace Garfield? Right now, the two actors whose names are being bandied around the most are Logan Lerman and Dylan O’Brien. Both are solid choices, and despite their almost eerie physical similarities (both are short, skinny guys with pale skin and dark hair), each would bring something very different to the table in terms of energy and focus.
Lerman, who received positive notices last year for his performance as a morally conflicted tank gunner in David Ayer’s World War II drama Fury, exuded a soulful sincerity worthy of Peter Parker as a lovesick high school freshman in The Perks of Being A Wallflower. He also has previous experience headlining franchises, as evidenced by the Percy Jackson series. O’Brien, who recently starred in the YA adaptation The Maze Runner, is primarily known for playing Stiles, a supporting character on MTV’s Teen Wolf whose motor-mouthed delivery could easily jibe with Spidey’s arsenal of snark. Given those strengths, perhaps Lerman should play Peter and O’Brien can wear the suit.
There’s also another option currently under discussion by the suits at Marvel and Sony. What if the latest big screen version of Spider-Man isn’t really Peter Parker at all? The last time the role was up for grabs, a significant portion of the fanbase rallied around Community actor Donald Glover, demanding that the affable comedian be cast as the first-ever black Spider-Man. The idea inspired Marvel writer Brian Michael Bendis to create the character of Miles Morales, a half-black, half-Latino teen who becomes Spider-Man in an alternate timeline.  Miles has since gathered a devoted following, and many, including Andrew Garfield himself, have expressed an interest in seeing him brought to life on screen someday. Could this be the time?
Purists would scoff at the idea, of course, and maybe they have a point. Peter Parker is one of the most enduring and relatable characters in comics for a reason, and it would be a shame to blow the first-ever opportunity to watch him interact with the rest of Marvel’s cinematic universe. But why do we have to choose between Peter and Miles? Just as the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) is clearly being groomed to one day assume the mantle of Captain America from Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), why not simply have a young Miles start apprenticing for Peter a few movies down the road? That way the eventual changing of the guard would feel more organic and dramatically earned.
Some might question the value of having Spider-Man join the Avengers in the first place. The web-slinger works best as a street-level hero, after all, and his superpowers, while effective against a localized menace such as Doctor Octopus, are not particularly useful when combating cosmic threats on the level of Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet. Both of those points are wholly accurate, but they miss the deeper truth of the character.
Like Robin and other various sidekicks in the DC stable, Spidey was created in part to act as a friendly intermediary between younger readers and the more intimidating concepts and characters contained within the material. More than that, though, he was the first comic book hero to behave like a real teenager, complete with relationship issues, money troubles and feelings of depression, guilt and inadequacy. Spider-Man might be amazing and spectacular and all the other Stan Lee-approved superlatives, but it’s Peter Parker’s essential humanity that has endeared him to audiences for more than half a century.

I’m a freshman. I came to USC with my head held up high, ready for that once-in-a-life-time college experience; I was going to meet tons of new people and develop my passions. Then halfway through the semester, my enthusiasm hit a brick wall and college became a nightmare. There were a lot of reasons why I felt depressed: an injury, roommate problems, being away from my family and not having a best friend or confidante to talk to about my problems. USC so often emphasizes making connections with others in the Trojan Family — most freshman have a whirlwind of acquaintances — but the most important relationships in a challenging, unfamiliar environment are close friends which are harder to come by.
When I read UCLA’s annual report on college freshman that was recently released, I couldn’t help but relate its findings to my own experience. It reported that emotional well-being was its lowest in 50 years. More than 9.5 percent of this year’s incoming freshmen feel frequently depressed and, though that number doesn’t sound high, out of USC’s freshman population of 3,098, that percent would amount to approximately 294 students.
A more realistic picture of my freshman year would have helped me. Most people talk about how it’s the most carefree year, partying and drinking, but from the majority of people I’ve met, that’s not true at all. My suitemates were hit hard by the increased college workload because they didn’t realize how much they needed to study. For them, second semester was a much easier transition. I’ve had juniors and seniors reassure me over the fact that they’d had less-than-perfect freshman years and didn’t find a group of friends until later years.
The best way USC can help support its freshman students is to provide them with more opportunities to speak to and interact with upperclassmen: many of them had the same concerns when they were freshman, whether its about uncertainties surrounding your choice of major or more personal issues. They reassured me that the situation won’t stay bad forever. One month into my second semester at USC, I have to agree with them. It really does get better.

Josh Tillman — better known as Father John Misty — slunk back onto the stage at the end of his set at Roxy Monday night in his typical slim-tailored suite and dark glasses, thanking the crowd for their “mandatory encore applause.” This self-aware act of simultaneously poking fun at and adhering to conventions perfectly encapsulates the walking contradiction of an artist that is Father John Misty.
His work regularly deplores the dehumanizing effects of Hollywood culture in the digital age, yet a significant portion of the crowd on Monday consisted of Tumblr fangirls squealing at every hip gyration, recording every finger wag and shoulder shrug through their iPhones. He idolizes the defiant anti-commercialism of artists like Bob Dylan and Norman Mailer, yet he embarked on a tour earlier this year opening for pop star Lana Del Rey (which he dubbed the “Who the Hell is Father John Misty?” Tour).
Discussing his artistic process, he is just as likely to invoke in complete earnest the words of Schopenhauer or Sartre as he is to sarcastically denounce all musicians in a string of expletives and unintelligible wisecracks
Tillman’s new album I Love You, Honeybear, his second release under the Misty moniker, takes this penchant for parataxis to the extreme; it’s a sonic pendulum swinging back and forth from the soul-bearing sincerity typically expected of a bearded folk singer to a slew of misanthropic observations on the absurdity of trying to narrativize one’s personal life for the consumptions of millions.
The character Tillman has created in Father John Misty is so confident and distinctive that it’s easy to forget that he spent almost a decade in relative obscurity, releasing stripped-down acoustic numbers as J. Tillman, before he got his big break when he was asked to join Fleet Foxes on tour as their drummer. This experience comes through on the new record, which is his most polished effort yet.
Father John Misty stretches notions of sincerity and authenticity on Honeybear by expanding his sound, foraying into genres and structures that are decidedly un-folk. The danceable synth-pop number titled “True Affection” sounds more like something from the mind of the former drummer of Animal Collective or MGMT than Fleet Foxes. The 21st-century sound follows the lyrical content, as Tillman wonders, “When can we talk/With the face/Instead of using all these strange devices?”.
He also sheds the usual marks of Americana influence such as pedal steel guitar, mandolins, and tambourines in exchange for a wall of loud, distorted guitars on “The Ideal Husband.” For an album supposedly all about love, this track sounds pretty angry, as Tillman confesses all the terrible things he has done in his life. His admiration for Neil Young is well noted and very obvious on this track, as well as the grungy guitar outro of “Nothing Good Happens At The Goddamn Thirsty Crow” and the conversational staccato soloing in “Strange Encounter.” Though he maintains that he is more of a writer than a “musician’s musician,” these moments show vast improvement in terms of writing songs that fit a full band setting, rather than the usual solo acoustic guitar pieces.
Fans of 2012’s Fear Fun will be pleased to hear the lush string arrangements and familiar soulful falsetto climaxes of ballads like “Strange Encounter” and “When You’re Smiling And Astride Me.” The jaunting “Holy Shit” also recalls the pseudo-political tripped out mystical prophet aphorisms that dominated his debut album. The song’s litany of modern day mundanities (“satirical news, free energy/mobile lifestyle, loveless sex”) parallels the detailed instructions for a satisfactory life read out by a haunting robot voice on Radiohead’s “Fitter Happier” off of OK Computer.
The fundamental difference between the Father John Misty of Honeybear and that of Fear Fun is not a difference in sound, but in magnitude. No matter what the sentiment is, the new record takes it further. The self-aware entertainer side of Father John Misty, for example, reaches its peak in the lead single “Bored In The USA.” The song served as a strange introduction for many people last month as he played the orchestral number on Letterman, starting the performance on a piano that continued to play on its own after he got up. If lines like “When I was young I dreamt of a passionate obligation to a roommate” didn’t tip listeners off to tongue-in-cheek nature of the song, the inclusion of sitcom laugh tracks surely did.
The sincerely romantic, confessional side of Father John Misty, on the other hand, is magnified to a similar degree in the album’s closer, “I Went To The Store One Day.” Possibly his most straight-forward narrative yet, it blurs the distinction between Misty and Tillman by telling the true story of how he met and fell in love with his wife—just in time for Valentine’s Day. The declarations of eternal love followed by plans for seven children and a house in the country seem uncharacteristically cliché.
Then, just before uttering the first words he ever said to her (“Seen you around, what’s your name?”), he comes out with one of the best lines on the album: “Insert here a sentiment re:our golden years”. It’s the perfect ending to a love record about the absurdity of love. There are moments like this scattered throughout I Love you Honeybear, in which it almost feels like he has revealed too much. He then quickly asserts his detachment and acknowledges that everything he is feeling and saying has been felt and said before—just never quite like this.

With a perfect 6-0 record to start the season, the No. 3-ranked USC women’s water polo team looks to continue its hot start this weekend when it heads out to Riverside for the Lancer Invitational.
To kick off the tournament hosted by Cal Baptist University, USC will play against the host Lancers at 4 p.m. on Friday. The game against the Lancers (2-6) will be a rematch of their meeting at the UCLA Invite on Jan. 17, which USC won by a score of 24-3. The Women of Troy jumped out to a 20-1 lead in the third period and never looked back. Eleven different players scored, led by senior Monica Vavic’s six goals.
Immediately following their match against Cal Baptist, the Women of Troy will take on the University of Redlands at 5:15 p.m. The Bulldogs    (0-3) last played against USC in this same tournament last year. The Women of Troy were victorious with a 24-1 win against the Division III school. Seniors Eike Daube and Jennifer Stiefel both scored three goals to lead the Trojans to victory, while sophomores Ioanna Haralabidis and Stephania Haralabidis each scored twice.
On Saturday, Feb. 14, USC will play against Pomona-Pitzer (2-2) in an 11:30 a.m. match. The last time these two teams met was at Harvard University for the 2013 NCAA Championship quarterfinals, where USC thrashed Pomona-Pitzer by a score of 27-1. USC eventually went on to win the national championship that year in a thrilling sudden-death win over Stanford.
Finally, the Women of Troy will face Occidental College (0-2) at   2 p.m. to end the tournament. In what will be just their third match of the season, the Division III Tigers will look to put up a fight against USC, one of the nation’s best teams.
Though the competition may not be at the level USC will face in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, head coach Jovan Vavic and the Women of Troy will look to ride the momentum of last weekend’s successful showing at the Triton Invitational. In fact, two young Trojan players were rewarded for their contributions, with Stephania Haralabidis being named MPSF Player of the Week for the first time in her career, while freshman goalie Victória Chamorro racked up the first award in her young career as MPSF Newcomer of the Week. Stephania Haralabidis led the Women of Troy offensively in La Jolla last weekend, scoring 14 goals to lead USC to four big wins. Chamorro provided a steady force in the cage for USC at the Triton Invitational, racking up a career-high 15 saves in the championship game against No. 6-ranked UC Irvine. Overall, Chamorro finished with a total of 27 saves in just 13 periods of work, while allowing only 11 goals during the tournament.
After the first six games of 2015, USC leads the MPSF in offense and defense, as the Women of Troy are outscoring their opponents by a lofty 123-21 margin. Vavic is USC’s leading scorer with 28 goals this season, while Stephania Haralabidis is second on the team with 22 goals, followed by twin sister Ioanna Haralabidis with 15. Defensively, Chamorro averages 7.2 saves per game and just 3.4 goals-against per game.
Furthermore, it could be a big weekend for Vavic, who will look to climb the ladder in USC’s record books. After a big scoring output to start the season, Vavic leaped up to No. 3 all-time in career scoring at USC with 219 career goals. With only five goals needed to reach No. 2 all-time, Vavic will almost certainly pass former Olympian Sofia Konoukh (224 career goals) this weekend.

The USC men’s tennis squad is heading to Chicago this weekend for the ITA National Team Indoor Championships. The tournament begins today and will continue until a champion is declared on Feb. 16. The tournament will feature 16 of the top 22 ITA Division 1 teams, with USC holding the No. 1 rank. The Trojans have performed well in this tournament over the past several years, winning in 2012 and finishing as runners-up the last two years.
The Trojans are a perfect 6-0 this season, including four victories in which they didn’t give up a singles match point to their opponent.
Senior Yannick Hanfmann holds a 12-2 overall record on the season and has won his last five singles matches. Senior Roberto Quiroz has notched 10 singles victories, including seven victories in a row.
Sophomores Nick Crystal and Rob Bellamy have combined for 27 singles victories, and both of them are currently riding a winning streak in singles matches. Additionally, senior Jonny Wang and junior Max de Vroome have 25 singles wins combined on the season.
Other notable teams competing in this year’s tournament include Pac-12 rivals No. 10 UCLA and No. 13 California. No. 3 Virginia and No. 8 Ohio State have caused problems for the Trojans the past two years, as each of them beat the Trojans in the tournament championship in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
The tournament also includes No. 4 Georgia, a team that the Trojans beat 4-0 earlier this month.
The Trojans will open their tournament play against                No. 16 -seed Penn State on Friday. Penn State holds a 3-2 record, but has lost two of its last three games. Some of Penn State’s key players include Matt Barry, Roman Trkulja and Aws Laaribi.
Barry is 8-3 overall and is riding a five-game singles winning streak. Trkulja is 8-5 overall but has three losses in his last five singles matches. Laaribi has a 7-4 record overall and has won five of his last six singles matches.
Depending on the outcome of the match against Penn State, the Trojans will face either Ohio State or No. 9 Texas. Meanwhile, No. 7 North Carolina will play UCLA in its opening game and then face either No. 2 Oklahoma or No. 15 Ole Miss. No. 5 Illinois will face California in the first round and then play against Georgia or No. 13 Columbia. Virginia will begin their tournament against No. 14 TCU and then face No. 6 Duke or No. 11 Baylor.
Assistant head coach Krzysztof Kwinta says the team has been working hard and should be able to adapt to the indoor playing conditions in Chicago. “We’ve been focusing [on the tournament] the past two weeks,” said Kwinta. “We’ve learned a little bit more aggressive style of game. You know, coming in, taking the ball early and shortening up the points, which you have to do playing indoors. We also played indoors at Georgia, so we’re kind of familiar with the indoor facility at the moment. So, I think the guys are excited for that type of play.”
Kwinta also said that he isn’t worried about the other teams that are competing. “I’m not that concerned about any team in particular,”  Kwinta said.
“I’m just concerned about our guys being ready to play 100 percent [and] stepping up to the game”, Kwinta added. “I believe when we do that, we are the toughest team to beat in the country, so that’s our main goal.”

The “Behavioral Science and Policy Conference: Health and Wellbeing” was held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center yesterday in celebration of Dr. Verna and Peter Dauterive Hall, which opened in September 2014 and is the university’s first interdisciplinary social sciences building.
“This conference is in recognition of the opening of Dauterive Hall. We have a group of interdisciplinary social scientists who are all working in this new building,” said Wendy Wood, one of the main organizers of the event.
Dauterive Hall currently houses several multidisciplinary centers focused on developing solutions to pressing social challenges.
The conference highlighted the work of top USC social and behavioral scientists along with their counterparts at Brookings Institution, a private nonprofit organization devoted to independent research and innovative policy solutions.
“This is an opportunity for us to find out what everyone is doing and [to] identify common interests, and perhaps projects that we can all move forward together on,” said Wood.
Arie Kapteyn, the executive director of Dornsife center for economic and social research, agrees with Wood on the importance of this conference.
“What it shows is the power of interdisciplinary work that we do in the building, both between the Schaeffer Center for health policy and economics and the center for socioeconomics research,” said Kapteyn. “It’s a policy in health, in genetics, and in behavioral economics. Nowadays, interdisciplinary research is very powerful and fruitful. It’s just great to have people together.”
This all-day conference aimed to illustrate how basic health research provides an empirical foundation informing health policy. Throughout the conference, attendees were able to gain insights into health and wellbeing research through panel presentations, discussions, and a graduate poster competition.
Wood, also the vice dean for the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and provost professor of psychology and business, gave a presentation on changing health behavior. During her presentation, she discussed why it is so difficult to change health behavior and how to form new habits that will be followed over time.
Wood mentioned several key research studies throughout her presentation. One of the case studies she talked about was the triangle pattern study, where subjects relapsed to old habits of the lack of exercising after intervention with payments to exercise for a month.
Wood said that effective self-control is crucial in forming good health habits and ultimately, health behavior.
Kapteyn, who also presented his views on the health and wellbeing in an aging population, said this conference is just the beginning and he wants the attendees to be excited to go to conferences in future.
“There are two things that are important during conferences. One is that you have to have the feeling that something exciting is going on. Something that triggers your interest and that you want to learn more,” Kapteyn said. “What you also hope from going to conferences is one or two snips of information you learned. Sounds like fairly little but if you remember one or two things that you hadn’t realized before, then that’s plenty.”
Kelsey O’Conner, a doctoral student in economics, said lunch was his favorite part of the event because he was able to have casual conversation with the attendees.
“It was an opportunity to meet other people and having a chance to interact with likeminded people,” said O’Conner. “Sometimes the best part of a conference is the informal activities in between sessions, because the sessions generate ideas and you have other people to bounce those ideas off of during the informal periods.”
Wood said she hopes to foster interdisciplinary connections for the attendees.
“Hopefully the conference will build interdisciplinary connections for faculty and students to follow up with and allow people to work together on topics of common interests,” Wood said. “If they’re speakers, I hope they figure out how to align with other researchers. If they’re in the audience, I hope they hear some topics that are of interest to them and they can collaborate with the speakers.”

Listen: The Last Five Years has come unstuck in time.
The film shrugs off any and all expectations for a romantic musical, but its non-linear timeline might be one of the most impenetrable aspects for those in the audience coming into the film unfamiliar with the 2001 stage production. The musical follows the arc of the five-year relationship between Cathy Hiatt, played by the always exceptional Anna Kendrick, and Jamie Wellerstein, played by relatively fresh face Jeremy Jordan. The film does not go at this in a straightforward matter.
The Last Five Years follows two timelines: Jamie’s, starting at the beginning going forward, and Cathy’s, starting at the end going backward. This structure allows for some powerful juxtaposition between the rose-colored moments at the beginning of a relationship and the starker ones near its end. If someone is going into the film with no prior knowledge, however, the benefits of this juxtaposition might well be lost. There are no explanations between time jumps. While it is obvious when a jump has happened — there is a jump after every scene — the structure of opposite but linear timelines might be too difficult to pick up. It is easy to mistake the jumps as random.
Director Richard LaGravenese weighed the inclusion of subtitles showing which year it was every time there was a jump, but test audiences reacted against them.
“After each screening, I’d ask them, ‘Do you want subtitles?’ … At every screening 99 percent of the audience said, ‘No, don’t spoon-feed us the story,’” LaGravenese said. “Every audience responded the same, ‘Yes [we were confused] at times, but it didn’t matter. We always knew where we were emotionally.’”
Timelines from his and her perspectives is nothing new. Just last year, The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby and The Affair, works released within months of each other, were two examples with similar structures. But The Last Five Years is a different animal. As a romantic musical being released on Valentine’s Day weekend, audiences will likely flock to the theater expecting a light celebration of love and instead find themselves confronted with a hard look at the complex nature of relationships. So it goes. But it is only difficult when it needs to be. Where Rigby and The Affair are both saddled with a somber tone throughout, The Last Five Years is not shy to celebrate the good times as well. This is probably what leads to the whiplash that the temporal jumps cause. The tonal shifts are so dramatic from joyous to melancholy that they can be bewildering. Yes, the point is made that relationships can change people, but the test audiences’ concerns about being spoon-fed are slightly comical.
The original musical was sung as a series of soliloquies, so perhaps with the lack of a realized world around the numbers, the emotional highs and lows might need to be more extreme so that the film would not run the risk of being ambiguous, like a silent film actress who exaggerates her facial expressions to compensate for a lack of dialogue.
The film is not subtle, but musicals never are. As a musical, the film is actually quite good. Kendrick is a delight and Jordan is a revelation — at least for those who are not very familiar with the current landscape of musical theater. Kendrick, coming off of the much larger production Into the Woods and the uber-playful Pitch Perfect, is becoming a go-to star for Hollywood musicals. It is difficult to find fault in this strategy. She has an easy, relatable charm combined with impressive vocal ability. The vocals in The Last Five Years were, for the most part, sung live to incorporate the emotions of the actors. Recent history suggests that this strategy runs the risk of ending up with an angry singing Russell Crowe, but here we get another great performance by Kendrick instead. In the opening number “Still Hurting,” in which Kendrick sets the tone for her unsuspecting Valentine’s Day audience by crying and singing alone in her apartment, the live performance allows Kendrick to start the film on an emotional note. The ever humble Kendrick expressed fears of “sounding like a chipmunk,” but her vocal performance proved to be much more Adele than Alvin. In “I Can Do Better Than That,” a much happier song featured in the trailers to further mislead audiences, she hits a fiery high note that makes the whole song.
Jordan, the very capable leading man, more than holds his own. Stemming from a more traditional musical theater background, Jordan knocks his numbers out of the park. Despite LaGravanese’s efforts to keep the characters on equal footing in terms of likeability, Jordan’s character comes up short in this regard. He is by far the less sympathetic of the two characters. But Jordan manages to overcome this and remain quite likable throughout the film. He has amazing ability as a singer and a performer, and he plays off of Kendrick as if he were on equal footing with her in fame.
The film’s structure might be a hindrance to any who go into it without foreknowledge, and this is always a red flag. Any film — unless it is a sequel — should be able to stand on its own without prior knowledge. Despite this, the film overall is quite strong. The performances are impressive and the juxtaposition of the two timelines is a powerful device, when the audience understands what is happening. If The Last Five Years proves difficult to decipher, a second viewing with an understanding of the structure is highly recommended.

In 2002, a young state senator from the 13th district of Illinois had this to say about former President George W. Bush’s proposed war in Iraq: “I don’t oppose all wars. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war.”
As he spoke, the nation hurdled towards war in Iraq and was already fighting in Afghanistan. Bush would justify both wars with the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force, a law passed just seven days after 9/11.
This week, that same state senator, now the president, has asked Congress for a new AUMF, this time to wage war against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, despite having ordered against fighting ISIS for the last six months. The politics of “act now, and ask permission later” must end, but for Congress to pass such an authorization would be a dangerous reversion to the state of the dumb and rash Middle East war that has defined the 21st century. Political realities necessitate that leaders look strong amid the beheadings and chaos wrought upon the Middle East by ISIS, but to authorize further force would exude remarkable closed-mindedness and signify another careless cession of war powers to the executive branch.
Like Obama, I also don’t oppose all wars. My grandfather captained a landing craft in the Pacific theater of World War II, and from Iwo Jima to Okinawa, he would run his ship onto the beach and deploy up soldiers. In combat, the average lifespan of a captain like him, standing on the bridge, was 18 minutes.
That war was against a well-defined enemy on a well-defined battlefield. The target of the latest AUMF is neither. If enacted, it would give Obama authority to use the Armed Forces against ISIS and “associated forces,” defined as “individuals and organizations fighting for, on behalf of, or alongside ISIS or any closely-related successor entity in hostilities against the [United States] or its coalition partners.”
Such a nebulously defined target is problematic: consider the case of the 2001 AUMF, which authorized force against “nations, organizations, or persons he [the president] determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 9/11, or harbored such organizations or persons.” This seemed like a reasonable restriction, until Obama justified the current air strikes against ISIS under the 2001 AUMF, despite very little evidence (including their complete disownment by Al Qaeda) that they are related to the terrorist attacks of 9/11.
The lack of a clearly defined enemy is compounded by the lack of any geographical limitation on executive power under the new AUMF. It makes the entire world — including the United States — a battlefield over which the executive branch would be legally able to use force, despite international law that prevents the use of force in another sovereign nation without that nation’s consent. The new AUMF merely repeats and entrenches the idea that the United States must serve as the world’s unlawful police force. In short, it is the same ideology that led us into Iraq.
Adding to the mess is a “sunset” provision within the draft, which states that the AUMF will expire three years after its enactment. If passed tomorrow, the AUMF’s power would extend for over a year into the term of the next president, a frightening possibility. While Obama might be trusted to use continued limited force, such an AUMF in the hands of a Marco Rubio or other extremist war hawk is too large a price to pay.
A new AUMF also begs the question: why will a fresh round of military power do anything to prevent ISIS from cropping up elsewhere, or another just as radical organization from taking its place? When Al Qaeda was defeated in Afghanistan, they cropped up in Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula. A decade later, they still haven’t been defeated. The flaw of Middle East policy is the mistaken belief that dropping bombs can quash radical ideologies. In six months, according to the Pentagon, coalition-led airstrikes have gained just one percent of ISIS’s territory.
The real solution to defeating ISIS is to reform the fundamental political exclusion of Sunni minorities by Shiite governments across the Middle East. In Iraq, for example, many Sunnis radicalized and joined ISIS because they were ostracized by Iraq’s Shiite-led government. It is Obama’s duty to restart efforts to encourage political reform in Iraq’s government and condemn the exclusion of Shiite groups by other governments like Saudi Arabia, even if they are our allies. While repairing the Sunni-Shiite political divide is undoubtedly more difficult than ordering airstrikes, it is a far more comprehensive solution.
In 2009, Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his vision of “international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.” Those values should be supported — but not selectively. If the president signs a new AUMF, especially under the rosy and shamefully misleading banner of “inherent resolve,” he should send his Nobel Prize back to Oslo.

Community colleges are defined by their commitment to being open-access educational institutions, providing a wide range of academic, training and service functions. Because community colleges were created to serve the public directly, they are often changing in response to the needs of the community. Until now, California’s community colleges have offered only associate degrees. The recent need for workers that require more than two years of training has allowed for the tentative release of four-year, career-oriented degree programs at 15 California community colleges. Another venture aimed at accommodating the rising need for higher education is President Barack Obama’s national free community college plan. Given California’s faulty education system, implementing four-year bachelor degree programs in community colleges would have a more positive outcome for the state than the implementation of Obama’s community college plan.
Community colleges are the point of entry for many students into higher education. More than 1,100 community colleges in the United States serve nearly half of the U.S. undergraduate enrollment. Community college bachelor’s degrees are already in place in 21 other states, and their addition to California’s education system makes California “no longer behind the curve,” as Sen. Marty Block, who authored Senate Bill 850 allowing the 15 pilot degrees, put it. The schools were picked on the basis of location and their capacity to create a high-quality program in a short amount of time. Advocates of community college bachelor’s degrees have pushed for their introduction in California to generate up to 1 million degrees for the state workforce by 2025. The 15 pilot degrees in California community colleges are ones not offered by the University of California or California State University systems, including airframe manufacturing, industrial automation, automotive technology, dental hygiene and more. These career-oriented additions contribute to the aim of meeting demand for highly trained workers in technical fields who may not have the means to receive a “fancy” education.
California’s 112 community colleges charge the lowest average tuition and fees in the nation at $1,429 per year, which is less than half the national average. The system began to charge tuition in 1984 and then introduced the Board of Governors’ fee waiver, which waives tuition for qualified low-income students. According to the Washington Post, nearly two thirds of all high-school graduates enrolled full-time at a California community college receive a full-tuition waiver. These reductions in prices have heightened levels of participation in higher education in California. High participation rates, however, have not translated into high levels of post-secondary success. The majority of California community college students never earn a degree or certificate. If community college becomes completely free, it might decrease post-secondary success rates even further, since free tuition and fees can lead to a reduction in the cost of leaving school.
Given the variable nature of the skills needed in the workplace, the education system has to take on the responsibility of accommodating the workplace’s variability. Adding four-year bachelor’s degrees to community colleges is a good start in this direction, as are structural alterations in community colleges and exploring competency-based education over time-based education. While free community college education is well-intentioned, it could negatively impact California’s community college system, given its already low cost and multitude of opportunities to gain free education with the appropriate qualifications.
I’m not sure what Yasmeen means by “California’s faulty education system” since she gives no examples or support for that point of view.  California’s colleges and universities are the envy of the world.

After scrolling through my newsfeed and reading countless articles raving about the new ABC series Fresh Off the Boat, I felt it was my social obligation as an Asian American to check it out myself. But I’m ashamed to admit, it wasn’t at the top of my priorities, or even at the top of my TV show priorities. To be truthful, it was only after my roommate likened me to the chubby, preteen protagonist with a love for gangsta rap that I felt I had to watch it.
I consumed the show in a state of giddiness and suspense. I’ve watched hundreds and hundreds of movies, thousands of TV show episodes, but never had I seen my personal, racial experiences shown on screen like that. The dimly lit, chaotic Chinese food markets and the mother taking all of the free tortilla chip samples — that was my life on the screen. During the course of my childhood, words could not describe the excitement that my sister and I felt for Costco samples. Reason could not justify why my mom would get mad at me for not taking a sample if it was food I didn’t like. If it’s free food, you take it. And it’s a sentiment that’s clearly shared by other Asian-American parents.
Though this is a significant breakthrough in the TV industry, Fresh Off the Boat only marks the beginning of an era in which Asian Americans will have an increasingly resonant voice on screen; and as with all beginnings, it can often be rough and shaky. The show is only two episodes deep, but I can already gauge the caricature-like tone of the show. The blatant distinction of “you white people” and “us Asians” definitely exists, but its portrayal in the show is exaggerated and lacks nuance. Of course, this is the style of the show, and it should be taken for its value as a milestone — the long-awaited platform for Asian-Americans to vocalize and share their experiences to the American audience.

Along with program planned trips and “survival Japanese” lessons, my time in Tokyo so far has been divided between getting to know the Keio University students joining us for the Keio Future Leaders Program (KFLP) and learning about how to immerse oneself in deep culture.
Without much consideration, “deep culture” can seem like a wishy-washy, gimicky phrase, but as Professor Shaules explained, deep culture is what allows travelers to have complex and immersive experiences during their time of travel. Culture is a concept that describes a society, and to truly appreciate new cultures, it is not enough to simply observe and marvel at the novel practices, sights, and sounds of the new environment. If you imagine culture as an onion, getting to deep culture involves peeling back the layers of the onion until you reach the center of the onion — the point where you come to an understanding of cultural practices because you are able to get behind the thought process of the culture’s underlying values.
Throughout three days of discussing deep culture and comparing (mostly) Western culture with Japanese culture, one of the most memorable moments was seeing the shock on the faces of the Keio University students when they learned how nonchalant the exchange of business cards can be in America and the U.K. The American students (myself included) and British students were equally surprised to learn that exchanging business cards in Japan is a serious ritual, mainly characterized by a two-handed presentation of one’s card to the other person.
The takeaway for the lectures I had on deep culture was to dissect why such contrasts exist between one’s own culture and that of another society. In the case of the business cards, prominent differences exist between America and Japan partly due to differences in the way the two societies show respect. While a single blog post is far from being enough space to adequately discuss deep culture and how to experience it, a starting point to deeply understanding culture is keeping in mind that different societies can have conflicting methods of achieving the same goals.

This month, in honor of the Asian Pacific American Heritage Festival, the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly is highlighting student leaders who have made a notable impact in the APA community at USC.
So far, two students have been announced:  Hannah Nguyen, a junior majoring in sociology, and Zachary Chaco, a junior majoring in computer science.
APASA is recognizing two students each week, who are nominated by other students based on their roles as APA leaders in the community. There have been more than 20 nominations to date.
Chaco currently serves as the President of Troy Philippines, USC’s Filipino culture club. He shared that being a part of the APA community is an important source of pride.
“Being a APA means I have found a culture that I have consciously decided I want to be a part of and is something I am proud to declare,” Chaco wrote in a APASA online questionnaire.
Nguyen is also an active voice on campus; she is a director at EdMonth, assistant director of Academic Culture Assembly and student worker at Asian Pacific American Student Services.
APASA, the umbrella organization for 21 different APA member organizations on campus, is one of eight assemblies under USC Program Board.
The APA leader recognition event is just one of 18 events held by APASA from February through April.  Other events will include a Asian Pacific Film Week as well as a luau hosted by the Hawaii Club.
Hahney Yo, internal community chair for APASA, said that considering the high number of APA students at USC, the APA leader event allows their voices to be heard when they otherwise might be drowned out.
“At USC, 20 percent of students here identify as [Asian Pacific American],” she said. “A lot of people don’t really understand what that means and what that identify holds, so we want to identify those people who live out that identity and share what they know about the struggle in the community.”

U.S. Olympic gold medalist Greg Louganis visited USC to talk to students and faculty about sports, diplomacy and LGBT rights.
Jian (Jay) Wang, the director of USC’s Center on Public Diplomacy, began the presentation introducing Greg Louganis as “the greatest athlete of our time and one of the greatest divers in history.”
Louganis is known for his outstanding performance in both the 1984 and 1988 Olympic Games, where he took home gold medals in both the springboard and platform diving competitions. During his presentation, he shared his experience as an Olympic gold medalist, as a member of the LGBT community and as a survivor of HIV.
Louganis described the 1988 Olympic Games.
“I was 28 and it was an Olympic year. About six months earlier I was tested for HIV. I’m a serial monogamous, so I thought I was pretty safe,” Louganis said. “It came back that I was HIV positive. That was kind of the tipping point for me.”
He said it was difficult to be training for the Olympics while simultaneously living with HIV.
“I had to take two pills every four hours,” Louganis said. “So I’m training all day while constantly being reminded that I had a compromised immune system.”
During the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Louganis cracked his head on a diving board. He remembers this incident as the day he thought the secret of being HIV positive would be revealed.
“I was paralyzed by fear,” Louganis said. “There was a stigma attached to HIV at the time. Gays, IV drug users and prostitutes were grouped together.”
It was through acting that Louganis found the strength to open up about his sexuality and condition. In Larry Kramer’s play “The Normal Heart,” Louganis played Darius, a character who “had HIV and was out and proud on TV.”  The play follows an organization’s fight to raise money and awareness for HIV and AIDS in New York City in the early 1980s. At this time the disease was shrouded in mystery and thus the fight for formal recognition at this time was controversial.
Louganis said that the role helped him springboard other aspects of his career.
“I’m on stage night after night playing this role thinking, what’s my next goal? I knew I wanted to write a book,” Louganis said. “It was really raw and honest. It forced me to really look at the aspects of my life.”
Since coming out to the public in 1994 and releasing his book “Breaking the Surface” in 1995, Louganis has become an advocate for inclusion in sports and supporter of individuality.
“Breaking the Surface” follows Louganis’s struggles from a young age with accepting his homosexuality, depression and domestic abuse.
Robert Zubiate, a first-year graduate student studying public administration, said he was inspired by the courage Louganis exhibited in his fight against HIV.
“What resonated with me was really how strong he is. I enjoyed hearing about people openly telling others that they [has] HIV positive or that they identify as LGBT, acknowledging that that takes a lot of strength, determination, and acceptance,” Zubiate said.
Louganis has experienced moments of triumph, during which progress for the LGBT community has been made. Nonetheless, Louganis admitted he has also experienced hardship.
Louganis opened up about the LGBT Open Games held in Moscow, where he and only one other athlete represented the U.S. The treatment received at the games was testament to the stigma that exists around sexual orientation.
“We were supposed to have an LGBT panel but when the host found out what the group was they shut off the lights and told us to leave,” Louganis said.
He talked about a figure skating workshop Konstantin Yablotskiy, a professional skater held for the group.
“We were just a group of people doing what we do but within 20 minutes we were shepherded off the ice,” Louganis said.
An audience member asked about the reaction of Louganis’s teammates to his sexuality.
“There were some incidences where there were signs saying, ‘beat the fag,’” he said. “Once my book came out the coach’s son came up to me and said, ‘I’m so sorry. I didn’t put the signs up, but I also didn’t take them down.’”
Louganis said self-confidence is a key component of success.
“The biggest thing anyone can do I think is be true to themselves. Having the confidence to be who I am is empowering. I was diagnosed at 28, I didn’t expect to see 30. Here I am at 55, and it’s really amazing. The best thing I can do is just be myself.”
Lypheng Kim, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, felt a personal connection to Louganis’ story, having experienced similar hardships.
“What he said about allowing athletes to come out at their own time … caused me to think about my own experience,” Kim continued. “People are afraid that there is no one there to support them. When I came out I realized there are family members who aren’t blood-related who consider you as your family and they are there to support you.”
Louganis concluded by reiterating the importance of continuing the progress being made for the LGBT community.
“When I have the opportunity to make a positive impact I always say yes,” Louganis said. “Everyone should understand, we have made tremendous progress in this country, but we still have a long way to go.”

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics continued its Students Talk Back event in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Wednesday afternoon with a discussion entitled, “The Cost of Higher Education: The Community College Debate, Student Loans and Rising Tuition,” which focused on issues of community college tuition in the wake of President Barack Obama’s proposal to make tuition free for community college students.
The panel featured Larry Gordon, higher education reporter for the Los Angeles Times; Dr. Bill Scroggins, President of Mt. San Antonio College, the largest community college in California; Samantha Archie, involvement director of USC College Democrats; and Brian Burley; a member of the USC College Republicans.
Co-moderators included Kerstyn Olsen, director of the Unruh Institute, and Sarah Dhanaphatana, news editor of the Daily Trojan.
The panel opened with a question about the current state of community college in California and how the attraction of free tuition might dissuade students from completing their degree.
Dhanaphatana began by listing statistical information released by the L.A. Times to inform the audience on numerical issues regarding community college enrollment.
“About half the students enrolled in California community colleges take more than four years to graduate,” Dhanaphatana quoted. “Among full time students who entered community college in 2007, over 35,000 had not earned their degrees within three years and most were not currently enrolled in college”.
However, Gordon did not view the discouraging statistics as a product of poor financial aid.
“Tuition in California for community colleges is the lowest in the country by far,” Gordon said.
Instead, he argued that the reason why so many people drop out of community college is because kids are not adequately prepared by their high school education. Therefore, difficult college courses discourage kids from continuing their education.
The conversation then shifted over to the criticism that Obama’s free college tuition initiative would encourage students to attend community college for free even if they were admitted to an accredited four year institution.
Scroggins disagreed, referring to how completion for transfer requirements do take significantly longer.
“Of [students who attend community college full time despite being admitted to a four year institution], within three years 70 percent of them complete the requirements for transfer, so I don’t think the criticism that [community colleges] are not a good avenue to transfer is a valid criticism of Obama’s proposal,” Scroggins said.
Olsen then asked how Obama’s proposal might affect overall student debt.
“Some of [Obama’s] opponents have criticized this proposal saying that it doesn’t have a lot of details on how it would be financed,” Olsen said.
Both Burley and Gordon agreed that the financial aid programs the country uses currently such as, Pell and Cal grants, need to be augmented in addition to Obama’s programs.
“Investment has not kept up with the cost of education,” Gordon said.
Burley expanded on the idea by suggesting that the country should reinvest in high school education when it connects to higher education.
According to Burley this would better prepare students for what to expect from the college experience.
“It would enhance our high school education and would give people the opportunity to know what they want to major in,” Burley said.
The conversation then shifted topics to the correlation between Obama’s community college initiative and the supposed “skills gap” between California workers.
Scroggins explained that the community college initiative does not fix the issue of the skills barrier.
“I think that providing a free avenue to access community colleges doesn’t address the main issue of a skills gap,” Scroggins said. “What we need are incentives for colleges to align their curriculum with the needs of employers, and for employers to be part of the education system.”
The final question of the event discussed the idea of 15 California community colleges starting to offer bachelor’s degrees.
Burley was in favor of the idea and explained that offering bachelor’s degrees in community colleges will result in higher skilled workers and wages.
“I think Obama’s pushing this so much, and as a result the work force will be more skilled,” Burley said. “I think Any time you do that you have higher skilled workers, higher wages. I think that’s the big positive.”
Scroggins agreed, but explained that the 21 states that offer bachelor’s degrees through community colleges fail to recognize that technical majors require a longer period of training.
“So 21 states around the nation — a lot of community colleges offer bachelor’s degrees, but they’re not in philosophy,” Scroggins said. “They’re in technical and applied fields, and those fields really require more and more training. To be a computer technician, or to be a medical lab technician, or to be a registered nurse, two years isn’t enough anymore.”

The Muslim Student Union hosted a candlelight vigil Wednesday evening outside the University Religious Center to honor three Muslims killed in a shooting near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Tuesday night.
On Tuesday evening, 3 Chapel Hill residents, Muslims of Arab descent, were shot and killed by their apartment neighbor.
At the vigil, participants gathered around lit candles placed on the ground in a peace sign. Attendees voluntarily spoke to the crowd about remaining strong for the Muslim community in a time of sadness. After the demonstration, a group of students huddled closer to the candles and prayed.
Muslim Student Union President Mushfiqur Chowdhury said the vigil was focused on remembering how precious each life is.
“The vigil served [the] purpose to show how fragile and innocent life can be, and at the same time to protect that and to sustain that and to remember that that’s our duty as neighbors, fellow Americans and people who are proud to be in this nation,” Chowdhury said.
Varun Soni, dean of Religious Life of USC, recognized the loss of the students’ futures at the event.
“We come together to ask ourselves, ‘can there be a loss greater than this?’” Soni said. “These student had big dreams, hopes and aspirations. They represented what was best about Islam and what was best about America.”
USC Humanist Chaplain Bart Campolo said that the shooting made him aware of how Muslim students feel about peers misunderstanding their culture.
“I was very shocked and deeply outraged by the news when I received it this morning,” Campolo said. “As the Humanist Chaplain however … I was also suddenly aware of how it feels to have your people and your way of life misunderstood and maligned because of the actions of people far away from you that are completely outside of your control and every Muslim on this campus knows exactly how that feels.”
Hishaam Siddiqi, a senior majoring in business administration, said comfort on college campuses is necessary for the Muslim community
“USC is a diverse campus, but there is only so many Muslims that this campus [has] and if I don’t go out of my way to join clubs like the Muslim Student Union it can quickly become a very, very lonely place,” Siddiqi said. “When you’re lonely and the entire country has an anti-Muslim sentiment you quickly become vulnerable no matter how liberal of an environment you might be in.”
Siddiq said he hoped the event brought security to his fellow Trojans.
“[For years] a lot of Muslim have been very afraid,” Siddiqi said. “Since 9/11, obvious tension in the country has been bad, but to have young people dying by being shot in the head is really bad. A big portion of the night tonight was so that Muslim students know that there is a sense of support and community and that USC supports religious life on campus and that it’s a place where we can find solidarity and comfort.”
The Muslim Student Community is committed to giving all students a safe space, according to Chowdhury.
“We’re here to provide a forum — a safe space — and fortunately the Office of Religious Life and Dean Varun Soni has helped us with that and provided us with the space and we’re servant leaders so we’re just trying to serve that to the other Muslim students,” Chowdhury said.
Saaliha Khan, communication and project manager at NewGround: A Muslim-Jewish Partnership for Change, who was at the event, said the candlelit demonstration will brighten the community.
“Today at USC, the Muslim Student Union and people of all backgrounds coming together was a demonstration to me of people transforming communities through the power of relationships, because it is these relationships and this sense of community that will continue to carry us forward through times of darkness.”
Chowdhury reminded students that everyone must remain hopeful through tough times.
“It’s in our darkest days that make the other days shine,” Chowdhury said. “We’re going to make sure that we don’t faint out. We’re going to be a strong flame in the sense that we’re here. We’re here to stay and we’re here to contribute.”
And what of this I ask the Muslim students?  Why do you not hold vigils for these people too?  Is it because the Qur’an teaches you that only Muslim lives matter?
