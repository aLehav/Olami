Free Wi-Fi could soon become a permanent feature on certain USC buses. USC Transit has begun testing the service on three of its buses on the Union Station route and said they plan to add Wi-Fi to more buses.
Bus · Wi-Fi is now available on busses traveling to and from Union Station. USC said it is looking into expanding the service to all buses. - Yasamin Yeganeh | Daily Trojan
Michelle Garcia, the associate director of USC Transit, said plans took off in a November 2011 meeting with Verizon Wireless.
Once Transit got assurance from Verizon that wireless Internet service was possible, they began the testing phase and installed the Wi-Fi on three Union Station buses, Garcia said.
Now, Garcia said, “it’s just not a matter of testing the service, but rather the whole package.”
Factors such as the reliability of the Internet connection, and the popularity of the service will be most important in determining the scope of the program.
“We’ve got to see how many people are using it, if it is working for them, if there are any service problems that make it not very useful,” Garcia said. “For instance, if there’s a spot that interrupts the Wi-Fi, it might not be worth it for somebody on a 20-minute bus route.”
The cost of the Wi-Fi will also be under scrutiny in the testing phase. According to Garcia, USC Transit is still exploring its options.
“We are not necessarily in a contract with Verizon at this point, so we could change vendors down the line if someone else has a better service option for us,” Garcia said. “We need to know if people are streaming videos on the trip because that helps us choose the kind of Wi-Fi.”
If testing goes well, however, Garcia said students could see Wi-Fi on more than just Union Station buses.
“It’s probably a couple months until we finalize the service, but then we will have to make a decision about putting Wi-Fi on shorter routes, like Route A and B,” Garcia said. “We need to see how many people would use it on a 10-minute ride to their apartment.”
Students said they would support free Wi-Fi, whether on only a few buses or on all USC buses.
“I take the bus to Union Station at least two times a semester and Wi-Fi would make it a lot better,” Sean Lawlor, a junior majoring in biochemistry, said. “I usually listen to music the whole way, but it would be nice to be able to use my laptop.”
As well as making the ride more enjoyable, students said they would appreciate being able to complete homework on their commute.
“It sounds like a really good idea because students could do their work and be productive while they are just sitting on the bus,” said Dorna Moini, a graduate student studying law. “I know I would use it.”

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety crime summary between Tuesday, Feb. 7 and Wednesday, Feb. 8.
Crimes against a person
At 12:55 a.m. on Feb. 8, DPS officers responded to Birnkrant Residence Hall and detained a student after witnesses reported that he punched another student in the face without provocation. The student who was struck did not desire criminal prosecution of the matter. In lieu of arrest, the second student was cited to Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 9:13 p.m. on Feb. 7, DPS officers questioned and released a non-USC male on 30th and Figueroa streets who matched the description of a kidnapping suspect from the previous day.
at 4:24 p.m. on Feb. 7, a staff member reported that a non-USC male, who occasionally visits the USC University Church, has made multiple statements, which she interpreted to be threats, and she fears for her safety because of the subject’s criminal and psychiatric history.
at 1:22 p.m. on Feb. 7, a security guard on Hill Street contacted the DPS office and reported that he was approached by a non-USC female outside of USC who appeared to be lost. DPS officers responded to the location and found the female to be very confused about her whereabouts and where she lived. LAPD officers were then requested and responded to take custody of the female.
at 9:47 a.m. on Feb. 7, Transportation Services personnel immobilized a student’s vehicle and a second vehicle that was displaying a forged copy of the student’s USC parking permit in Parking Structure C. The student contacted the Transportation Services office, agreed to pay all fees and fines, and her vehicle was released. The student was advised that the matter would be referred to Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards.

Theo Offei and Julia Riley are running for Undergraduate Student Government’s president and vice president, respectively, with the goal of making university life more inclusive for all students.
Election 2012 · Julia Riley, a junior majoring in political science and art history, and Theo Offei, a junior majoring in political science, are one of the USG presidential tickets. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
Offei, a junior majoring in political science, served as student body president at Cabrillo College in Santa Cruz before transferring to USC. Riley, a junior majoring in political science and art history, is the vice president of the Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Fraternity.
“We decided to run because of the disconnection between USG and the student body at large,” Offei said. “We believe we have a greater opportunity to build a greater connection and stronger relationship between these groups.”
Offei and Riley said one of their main goals is to represent student groups who are usually not recognized. Their platform also includes plans to implement two-unit courses to help prepare students for graduate admissions tests, such as the LSAT, GMAT, MCAT and GRE; extending the hours at Doheny Memorial Library and the Lyon Center; and extending the benefits of the USCard so students can receive discounts from local businesses, a goal Offei accomplished at Cabrillo.
“Our platform goals are really aligned with this high achieving academic success President [C. L. Max] Nikias has been advocating for,” Riley said. “These two-unit courses and extended hours at Doheny are two things that will really aid this message.”
Offei and Riley said they plan to stay connected with the student body by increasing the transparency of USG and making themselves more available to students by holding round-table discussions and attending group meetings.
“It’s imperative we reach out to the student body,” Offei said. “We’ve got to put USG out there and make sure they know it’s a government for the students, of the students and by the students. We want USG to be very visible by the end of our term, and hopefully it’ll continue from there.”
Offei and Riley said their ticket is unique because they have the leadership experience to accomplish their platform goals.
“[At Cabrillo] I worked with legislators in Santa Cruz county, I worked with a lot of business and community leaders and visited Sacramento to lobby with legislators,” Offei said. “If I can lobby the workers of Sacramento, I’m pretty sure I can go through with our goals at USC.”
Offei and Riley identify with groups of students they consider traditionally underrepresented within USG, so their ticket aims to diversify and make USG more accessible to transfer students, international students and various groups typically ignored.
“We’ve already started this idea of inclusion by specifically targeting those groups who have not really had their voices heard,” Riley said. “These groups need to be heard. The basis of USC is these diverse groups that provide so much for USC culture [and are], a lot of the time, overlooked because they do not hold as much power.”
It is currently Offei’s first year at USC, but during his term as student body president at Cabrillo College, he worked with legislators in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., advocating on behalf of students.
He is a member of the Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Fraternity and a recipient of the Jack Kent Cooke Scholarship, awarded to him in recognition of his academic success and leadership.
Riley is the co-founder of the USC chapter of the American Red Cross, and he served as director for two years. She also volunteers with Women and Youth Serving Each Other to mentor local junior high school girls.
“We bring a new perspective to USG,” Offei said. “We’re running to change USC so that it works for the students. We’ll bring real changes that will affect the lives of students.”

Candidates for Undergraduate Student Government president emphasized differences in their platforms and biographies in an hourlong debate Wednesday night to an audience of about 150 students in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Forum.
Talking points · USG presidential candidates Jared Ginsburg, Mikey Geragos and Theo Offei squared off in the USG debate Tuesday. - Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
The debate was moderated by Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Director Dan Schnur, Daily Trojan News Editor Rachel Bracker and Annenberg Television News Multimedia Director Robbie Heeger.
“All three candidates were tremendous,” Schnur said. “They were prepared for all the substantive questions, they all found a way to articulate their priorities and they all showed a sense of humor when we threw a curveball at them.”
Candidates were asked which platform point mattered the most to them. Jared Ginsburg, current USG director of campus affairs, said he would want a fall break. Theo Offei, said he would advocate for a two-unit class to prepare students for graduate school entrance exams, such as the LSAT and MCAT. Mikey Geragos, current USG director of university affairs, said he wanted to improve the quality of food in residential dining facilities.
Vice presidential candidates posed one question each to a president on another ticket.
Samantha Coxe, who is running with Ginsburg, asked whether Geragos’ decision to designate a line for Troy Camp on the USG budget was because the sister of Geragos’ running mate, Vinnie Prasad, serves on the organization’s board.
Geragos said his rationale for placing Troy Camp in the line-item budget was because Troy Camp had always run out of money, and it would also leave more funding available for other organizations.
“It’s not that we are playing favorites,” Geragos said. “They have shown in the past that they have maxed out their funding.”
For his question, Prasad asked Ginsburg how he would represent all constituencies, because Ginsburg and Coxe make the only all-Greek ticket.
Ginsburg said his and Coxe’s experience with other organizations showed their diversity and he would actively work to reach out to all Trojans.
“If you look on our website, you will see details for every kind of constituency,” Ginsburg said.
Still, some students like Jennifer Lemus, a sophomore majoring in astronautical engineering, expressed concerns about Ginsburg and Coxe’s membership in the Greek community.
“The only thing that stood out to me was Jared and Sam being Greek,” Lemus said. “I feel they might give preference to Greek organizations despite what they say. I do want [a president] who represents all USC.”
Schnur said that in the four years he has been moderating the debate he had never seen a higher turnout. USG President Monish Tyagi noted a larger attendance than usual.
“The turnout was absolutely amazing,” Tyagi said. “I think this shows how people care about USG; and people are getting more invested in it.”
When asked about how some of their platform priorities would be funded, such as extending campus center hours, Offei proposed that USG fundraise rather than raise student fees. He said when he was student body president at Cabrillo College, before transferring to USC, his administration had raised $16,000 to aid Japan after the earthquake.
“USG should start putting effort into fundraising,” Offei said. “It doesn’t hurt to fundraise.”
The candidates also pointed out their differences on the addition of a fall break. Ginsburg said he would push for a fall break in October but would be open to other options, and Offei said students would prefer an extended Thanksgiving break because international students could not afford two trips home.
“I do not think giving students a fall break in October, as Mr. Ginsburg has proposed, is a good idea because some students do not live in this vicinity,” Offei said. “I think extending it during Thanksgiving break could make more sense.”
Jerry Ting, a sophomore majoring in political science, said a fall break in October would not allow students to travel home. Instead, he favors an extended winter break.
“I have friends who live in China, and it is not feasible to go back for that time,” Ting said. “Extending winter break would make more sense to me.”

I thought that Mikey came off extremely unlikable and insecure. I thought it was really funny when he gave a smart ass to Jared and was shut down by the moderator. Jared may not be the most eloquent, but his desire to win is evident. None of the candidates are particularly charmers, but Jared is cute in a goofy way. Mikey just seems sad. He seems reliant on gimmicks like, “Robert Woods is wearing my button, check that out.” It just seems kind of desperate. I think it is clear that Theo is not a contender. And I think Jared went up in the “polls” after this debate.
For anyone who actually attended the event or takes the time to listen to the video, would know that is not true at all. If anything, Jared spoke more eloquently and knew what he was actually talking about. They have MY vote as well as anyone who cares about this school! 
But yes, I hope a lot of people come out and vote.
This is not accurate of what actually occurred at the debate. Learn how to report.
I disagree. Rothberg did a good job of summarizing the key events of the debate.
On a different note, I thought Mikey nailed it! Jared came off really unlikable. Mikey and Vinnie definetly have my vote! But regardless of who you support, I encourage all Trojans to participate in the election and show that the student voice does matter.

Though the Women of Troy have lost four of their last six games, USC is poised to pull the upset against the Bay Area schools.
No sentiments of worry or concern were expressed this week as the Women of Troy travel north for their toughest, most pivotal road trip of the season.

“It’s another game, another chance to get two wins on the road,”  senior forward Briana Gilbreath said. “You can’t think about the past, any losses that you’ve had. You have to go in with a certain kind of confidence.”
That the Women of Troy approach this game as a challenge and not a lost cause is encouraging. Stanford is a national powerhouse that has appeared in each of the past four Final Fours and has not lost a game at Maples Pavilion since February 2007.
But USC has been road-tested plenty this season. Perhaps the biggest win of the year came at Gonzaga. USC has lost close games in tough environments, including a devastating one-point loss in December at Texas A&M, who is the defending national champions.
“We’ve played against big crowds and hostile environments,” senior guard Ashley Corral said.  “We know what they feel like so that’s not going to be an intimidation factor.”
Another source for confidence comes from these two teams’ first meeting this season. On Dec. 29, USC gave Stanford all it could handle in a 61-53 loss at the Galen Center, giving the No. 4 Cardinal one of their biggest scares of the season.
“That’s one of those games we feel like we let slip away,” Corral said of the first matchup.  “We did a good job against the Ogwumikes. I think it comes down to heart and will this time.”
“The Ogwumikes” is a phrase used around women’s college basketball to describe the nation’s most lethal duo: The sister act of forwards Nnemkadi and Chiney Ogwumike has taken the country by storm since they both arrived on campus. Now, the pair averages a combined total of 38 points and 22 rebounds per game.
“I don’t really take it as a personal challenge,” Gilbreath said of going against Stanford’s star combo. “I just have to go out and play hard for my team. If we all do that, then we’ll be OK.”
A victory on Thursday would elevate the Women of Troy out of their current three-way tie for fourth place in the Pac-12 with Arizona State and Oregon State. It would also give the team its signature win and build strong momentum for the stretch run of the season leading up to the Pac-12 Tournament.
Tip-off is scheduled for 6 p.m. and the game will be televised on Fox Sports Net.
GO STANFORD!
Next victim at Maples:  u$c
The team needs to worry about Cal first and foremost. Chances against Stanford is totally slim and none. You can’t hold a seventeen pt. lead vs. Utah on the road who is a poor team and expect to compete with the #4 team in the country at their home court. Let’s be honest this team has once again under achieved .

The last time the USC men’s basketball team faced California, in the Pac-12 opener for both teams, it served as a competitive, back-and-forth contest that nearly went into overtime.
The Trojans outscored the hosting Golden Bears by eight points in the second half, nearly pulling off the upset win before guard Allen Crabbe sank three free throws in the waning seconds to seal their fate. The Trojans lost 53-49.
But much has changed — at least for USC — since late December.
Gone are redshirt sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon and redshirt junior forward Aaron Fuller, who have been sidelined for the remainder of the season because of a torn medial collateral ligament and a torn labrum, respectively.
That has left USC (6-18, 1-10) with a shortened eight-man rotation, including two walk-ons, as it prepares to host Cal (18-6, 8-3) for the second time this season on Thursday at the Galen Center.
“I went through every roster in the league,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “Take out all their juniors and seniors, take out four of their five starters, we’d have the best team. That’s our plate. Nobody wants to hear or admit. It’s just the way it is.”
O’Neill and company have known their latest predicament for a couple of weeks now.
Fuller has been out of the lineup since mid-January. Dedmon was injured on Jan. 26 against Colorado. And senior guard Jio Fontan, who is among five USC players sidelined for the remainder of the season, hasn’t suited up all year.
“It’s how it is,” O’Neill said following the team’s practice on Tuesday. “Hopefully guys take advantage of this opportunity.”
One of those players happens to be sophomore forward Garrett Jackson, who has averaged 15.3 points per game since Dedmon went down with an injury last month.
But it hasn’t exactly been easy for Jackson. The six-foot-six Oregon native has been forced to play power forward and center because of the Trojans’ glaring lack of height, often defending players at least two or three inches taller and several pounds heavier.
“It’s just something that comes with the territory,” Jackson said. “With our numbers down, there is nothing else we can really do. We have to make do with what we have.”
Junior center James Blasczyk, who is listed at seven-foot-one, remains the only player taller than Jackson. But because of a stress injury in his right foot sustained earlier this season, he has been unable to practice and has been limited during games.
With a smaller lineup, USC’s offensive attack has slightly adjusted and has become more predicated on 3-point shooting and perimeter play. Last weekend against Washington and Washington State, the Trojans hoisted a combined 41 attempts from beyond the arc over the course of two games.
Despite their efforts, they converted 10 of those attempts — 24 percent. This season, they’re shooting 28 percent from 3-point range.
“We had great shots,” O’Neill said. “If you’re open, shoot the ball. It’s not like we have an inside presence right now. So what we’re trying to do is spread the floor, dribble, drive and shoot shots.”
There has, however, been a small glimpse of hope in junior guard Greg Allen. Allen, who transferred to USC from Navarro College, has shown promise in recent weeks, going 3-for-4 and 5-for-11 from beyond the arc against Utah and Washington State, respectively.
But against Washington, he made one of 10.
“All my shots feel like they’re going to go in,” Allen said. “It’s just a matter of me keeping my follow-through up and watching the ball go in. Sometimes I get fatigued and start shooting the ball differently. That’s when it doesn’t go in. I just have to be more consistent.”
The Trojans will need that consistency against the Golden Bears, who are currently second overall in the Pac-12 standings, just one game behind Washington.
But Cal has struggled away from Haas Pavilion this season, holding just a 2-4 mark on the road.
“We’re at home,” O’Neill said. “Hopefully we play better at home.”
Tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The game will not be televised but will be broadcasted live on USCTrojans.com.

As the completion of the John McKay Center nears, Trojan players and fans alike have a lot to be happy about. The new three-story athletic facility features 110,000 square feet of space which includes weight rooms, football offices and even an indoor practice field. Such facilities are vital in this era of college football, where flash and glamor are often selling points for recruits.
Quite the character · John McKay coached USC from 1960-1975. He won four national titles, but was known just as much for his wit. - Photo courtesy of USC Athletics
As USC fans, however, we should not only celebrate this historic building as a tool to make players better, but must see it in its historical context, for the man it was named for: John McKay. For without the legendary coach, USC football would not be where it is today.
McKay took the coaching job at USC in 1960 after being an assistant for both Oregon and, later, USC. His tenure hardly started well; the Trojans finished with eight total wins in his first two seasons. It did not look like the McKay era was going to be anything special.
The tide turned, however, in 1962. McKay’s squad finished the season 11-0 and capped off the season with a Rose Bowl victory over Wisconsin. The Trojans would win three more national championships under McKay in 1967, 1972 and 1974. They won the Pac-8 Conference nine times in his 16 seasons.
Though the wins and losses are crucial to McKay’s legacy, he was much more than just a 127-40-8 record. He was a character. He was a man that changed football in Los Angeles for good.
McKay saw two Heisman Trophy winners walk through campus in Mike Garrett (1965) and OJ Simpson (1968). He coached quarterback Pat Haden, NFL Hall of Fame receiver Lynn Swann, “Notre Dame Killer” Anthony Davis and Sam Cunningham — the runningback who, for all intents and purposes, caused the South Eastern Conference to integrate in 1970, forever changing the landscape of college football.
McKay might be most noted for his wit and his quotations, many of which Trojan fans remember to this day.
When asked why Simpson had 47 carries in a game, he replied, “He doesn’t belong to a union. Anyway, the ball doesn’t weigh that much.”
When asked about his team’s less-than-stellar performance, he retorted with, “We didn’t tackle well today, but we made up for it by not blocking.”
Perhaps his most famous line came while he was the coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and was asked what he thought of his team’s execution in a loss. His response? “I’m all for it.”
John McKay changed football at USC. Yes, the Trojans had success in prior years, winning championships under legendary coach Howard Jones, but McKay created a culture of winning.
Pete Carroll brought USC football back; McKay made the tradition a legend. The legacy of “Tailback U” would not exist if McKay hadn’t installed the I-Formation into his offenses. The Trojans would have four less banners to show in Heritage Hall were it not for McKay. There would be two less Heisman Trophies.
But most of all, there is a good chance that USC football would have been stuck in mediocrity. Sure, a great coach could have come in and won many games. But McKay didn’t just win games; he won students and fans with his success and character.
The next time you walk by the McKay Center, which is expected to be finished in the fall, admire it for more than its impressive exterior. Admire it for more than the fact that it gives the Trojans another edge in recruiting the best players in the country.
Instead, admire it for the man it is named after. The man who made USC football what it is today. The man who changed college football for the entire country.

Coach John McKay.  Man, I  love the way those words just seem to fall into place….
Good story Michael…..

“Wait … USC has a hockey team?” is the typical response people have upon learning of one of the oldest club sports teams at the university. Such a reaction is understandable, as a successful college team in the middle of Downtown Los Angeles is not quite expected.
Proven commodity · Although hockey is not a varsity sport at USC, the Trojans have found success over the years since their establishment in 1926. They defeated UCLA to win the Crosstown Cup last Friday. - Photo courtesy of USC Men’s Ice Hockey
Founded in 1925, the team is now part of the American Collegiate Hockey Association as a Division-II team. The 1930s were a time of great popularity for the unique team when its archrival was Loyola Marymount. Southern Californians, who had essentially no exposure to this on-ice game, came out in droves to attend these infamous matches. According to Sports Illustrated, one match drew 8,000 fans — a record-breaking occasion.
After its heyday in the 1930s, the team went in and out of existence. Recently, the team’s popularity has soared once more as it won the PAC-8 championship in 2010. According to assistant general manager, Johnny Nguyen, “The team is the most prevalent it has been since the 1930s.”
This season’s popularity surge is understandable as the team has had a winning season and will play in the PAC-8 playoffs in Seattle this weekend. Only the top four teams of the conference qualify and the Trojans had a tough  fight to contend in the playoffs. Winning seasons are not easy to come by with schools such as UC Berkeley, UCLA, Oregon, Stanford, Utah, Washington and Washington State in the same conference.
With players hailing from all over the United States and Canada, the team provides them the opportunity to surround themselves with friends who all share the unique love of hockey. Luke Walker, a graduate student studying mechanical engineering, is grateful for the wonderful opportunity he has been given playing for USC. “Playing on the hockey team has been a blast. I have met hard-working friends through this great experience […] I feel that being a part of the team has increased my overall experience here at USC,” Walker said.
Though the season got off to a rocky start, the team eventually found their chemistry on the ice and success soon followed. “We had a rocky start with so many new players and lack of chemistry, but we finished stronger in the second half of the season, which is why we’re headed to Seattle this weekend.”
During their unsteady beginnings, they lost to UCLA twice, jeopardizing the chance to keep the Crosstown Cup — the trophy awarded to the team that wins the annual best-of-five series between the two Los Angeles schools.
The resilient Trojans bounced back from this two-game deficit to annihilate the Bruins in their next two match-ups, forcing the series into a game five.
A moment of panic swept the UCLA and USC campuses when UCLA’s team was put on probation for missing a paperwork deadline. Their punishment was to forfeit the series against the Trojans and not play the final game.
Discomfited fans of both teams united together to protest this decision. Thankfully, the ruling was overturned and the Bruins and Trojans were able to play another game. The game also happened to be senior night, where the team said goodbye to five seniors and two graduate students.
A force to be reckoned with until the absolute end, the USC Trojans decimated the Bruins 8-3 that night. In addition to a glorious season-ending game on home ice at The Rinks Anaheim ICE — the practice facility of the NHL Anaheim Ducks — there were food trucks and two special appearances: the USC Kazan Taiko Japanese Drum Players and the Trojan Knights with the Victory Bell in tow.
This weekend the Trojans look to play Utah in their first-round matchup with the hopes of winning their ninth PAC-8 Championship.
Build them an ice rink on campus,,,,the fans will come!
Trojans rule!  Bring home the Championship.  Let’s support this club more, they deserve it.
What a great way to end the season.  I look forward to hear the results from Seattle this weekend.  GO TROJANS!!!  FIGHT ON!!!  Oh……. and I like that we resurrected the Bruins out of detention so we could clobber them!!!
I love the hockey team at USC!  Wonderful to see this write up on them.  Hopefully this will give awareness to the Trogan Family to have them come out to support this amazing team!  FIGHT ON!!!  Best of luck in Seattle!  We all know you will take them down…
Great article! Good luck in Seattle! Hope we win!
Glad to see an article covering this important CLUB Sport. I hope to make some of next years games.
Final Four in Pac- 8 is cool.
Fight ON!
The ICEMEN COMETH to Seattle,
Tommy Trojanelli

First came the cupcake. Bakeries frosted, filled, topped, decorated and supersized the individual treats until there wasn’t much left  to be done.
Following suit as the next hot trend was the macaron -— the petite French meringue sandwich cookie that had people going crazy for more. Neither has become extinct, but another pastry is joining   their ranks. Far from a novel creation, the humble pie is being infused with new life.
Forget basic cherry and blueberry: To stay on the cutting edge of culinary trends, L.A. bakeries have to dish out some majorly inventive pies and turn up the cuteness factor at their storefronts.
Here are some of the best slices in the city.
 
The Pie Hole
This newcomer to the Downtown scene plays off an urban hole-in-the wall setting, and it works. Situated on the eastern side of Downtown near the popular Zip Fusion and Wurstküche restaurants, the bakery looks like an old classic with its brick façade and iron chairs. Inside, the menu is rolled out on brown paper, giving its somewhat pricy items a casual feel.
The décor may be minimal, but the food packs quite a punch. All sweet pies are available by the slice, and several savory options, such as tomato-basil, come in pocket-pie form.
The variety depends on which ingredients are in season, but all of the current selections have been around for more than a month thanks to their impressive popularity.
The most unique selection is a pie made of a flaky croissant-like crust and a filling similar to rich chocolate soufflé. Top that all off with some caramel and sea salt and you have what The Pie Hole calls its “crostada.”
This is for the foodie with a serious sweet tooth. Though it’s almost overwhelmingly sugary, the lightness of the crust and whipped filling offset the possibility of a richness overload. The salt sprinkled on top is perfect and makes each bite pop with so much flavor that the slice will disappear in no time.
 
Short Cake 
Though its name would indicate that it’s known more for cakes, this Original Farmer’s Market bakery can do a pretty great personal pie. The little desserts come in fun flavors like brown-butter pear and buttermilk custard. But as with The Pie Hole, they are not all available at once.
If you love a good crust, Short Cake may be your place. Because the pies are made individually, they are surrounded by plenty of flaky, homemade crust. The apple version is a standout, livened with a tangy hint of lemon and enveloped in a perfectly browned pastry that melts in the mouth.
The bakery’s location makes it the perfect place to grab a dessert or snack after shopping at The Grove. The only downside is the area’s busy parking lots, but for a little bundle of goodness, it could be worth a trip.
 
Simplethings Sandwich and Pie Shop
Generally, dessert is the star of a meal as the sweetness of a treat lingers entrancingly at the end. This is true of Simplethings, a shop that serves a wide variety of sandwiches and a selection of miniature or regular-sized pies.
Guests order at the front of the simplistic, Southern-inspired eatery and can choose a pie from the case to pick up after finishing a sandwich. If you ask for your pie first, the waiters will happily oblige.
The pie flavor schedule can be viewed online before making the trek to West Hollywood. Everyone has their favorite pie flavors, but the selection at Simplethings will delight any day of the week. Traditional flavors rotate constantly while seasonal ones come and go.
Following the salty-sweet trend, the salted caramel pie is a standout, with its graham-cracker tart crust and gooey filling as rich as that of a candy bar.
 
Magnolia Bakery
New York’s bakery of “Sex and the City” fame opened its doors here in the summer of 2010 and has been bringing its dessert charm to West Hollywood with a variety of classic baked goods.
Sitting beside its pretty pastel-frosted cupcakes are pies that could win at any state fair. All of the pies — including the black bottom pecan, a chocolatey twist on the original — are sold by the slice.  That particular pie has got it all: perfectly toasted nuts and a luscious sweetness that binds the intriguing richness of the cookie crust.
Magnolia may be one of the more traditional bakeries in town, but it has proven that fresh, quality ingredients can speak volumes. While others may come and go with varying trends, this one will never get old. Let’s face it: Everyone gets a craving for an old family recipe now and then.
Whether you are looking for a different choice at a favorite sweet spot or want to try the cream of the crop, great pies are everywhere around the city, waiting to be searched out and sliced up for your indulgent pleasure.
Nice info ….all the knowledge about bakery .Thanks for posting…

Moon Juice, a new juice shop in Venice, conjures the same feeling as Alex Trebek’s pronunciation of French words on Jeopardy!: mild admiration, moderate apprehension and, mostly, annoyance.
Nature’s recipe · Almond milk, raw granola and bananas offer an organic option for patrons looking for a healthy breakfast choice. - Photo courtesy of Emily Hart Photography
While juices and smoothies from Moon Juice hit the palate in a thoughtful and provocative manner, the prices also hit one’s wallet hard. Justifying $9 for a bottle of juice, no matter how gourmet, is too heavy a task for any student.
The storefront physically embodies Moon Juice’s postmodern bent. A small patio, with a bench, shaded by a large tree, rests on concrete and stones.
The interior is primarily refrigerated to keep the juices chilled and the shelves cold enough for organic nuts and dried fruits to be displayed. Most significantly, seating is scarce — if you want to sit in the shop with three friends, one of them will be stuck in a child’s chair.
As amusing as it is to see a six-foot-tall man squatting on a short wooden stool, it’s disappointing, as even lesser franchise juice shops generally provide space for patrons to enjoy their drinks.
The setup would make sense if Moon Juice were closer to the Venice boardwalk — in that scenario, customers could get their fix and stroll along the sand while sipping.
The shop, however, is seven blocks from the shoreline. By the time you walk to the beach, you’ll probably be halfway done with your beverage.
Additionally, though workers are able to speak at length about the health benefits of the shop’s juices and smoothies, which have no sugar added and are made naturally from organic produce, Moon Juice has no printed materials detailing nutritional information.
The cashier’s explanation of “not having a laboratory” is an unfortunate excuse for a store that seems to pride itself on offering tangible nutritional benefits.
And though a new eatery needs time to develop its details, an eatery that advertises its food as being healthy should have more than vague health benefits like “fat-flushing, virus-fighting and body-strengthening,” for the  carrot, lime & coconut beverage on its menu.
When shelling out around $10 for a non-alcoholic drink, customers ought to know what they’re getting.
Despite these shortcomings, Moon Juice’s products are wonderful. All of the concoctions sampled touch different areas of the flavor palate in the most delectable ways possible. To top it all off, the cold-pressed juices do not get heated or oxidized in the process, making all of the products safe for raw vegan foodies.
One deliciously orange drink, Spiced Yam, surrounds the taste of garnet yams with tart red apple and wholesome carrot, and punctuates it all with a hint of ginger root and a touch of sharp cinnamon. Gingered Lemon, from the $12 section of the juice menu, impressively brings out the sweetness in lemon and green apple, and again applies a gentle prickle of ginger.
The best selections, however, seem to be the Moon Milk options. These shake-like beverages offer more familiar flavors with perfectly executed twists.
The Banana Walnut is as thick as a McFlurry without the added sugar or animal products, and miraculously tastes like a liquefied piece of your grandmother’s banana bread.
The option to make your own concoction would be more appreciated if it were not so out of place in a shop with such a high standard for flavor combinations — it’s like seeing Spago let diners concoct their own entrées.
The option is nice, but considering that Moon Juice charges around $10 for a drink, the store shouldn’t be afraid to take charge and maintain high recipe standards all the time.
Despite complex and scrumptious blends, the execution of Moon Juice often comes off as pretentious.
Serving raw and mostly vegan foods of the highest quality is an admirable trend to follow, especially when a restaurant pays such close attention to taste and mouthfeel.
But the exorbitant prices seem unnecessary, especially when you can replicate much of the experience by buying your own apples, ginger and lemons and sticking them in a juicer.
Because of these flaws, Moon Juice is not worth the trek from campus to Venice; if you happen to be spending the day at the beach, you’re probably better off getting an apple at a supermarket.
And though following sustainability, organic food and other trends toward an eco-friendly, healthful world is admirable, it’s not enough to do so at an unreasonable price.
Moon Juice is 100% organic…and others claim organic, but when asked , they say they try to be organic when possible. BIG difference. Yea and it costs more to always be 100%.  I’ll gladly pay for that!
“THE REAL DEAL”
Its worth every penny 3lbs of veggies in a bottle and they are organic.
Goodness Greens and the Cilantro Celery Punch is a must and the
E3 a shot is a WoW!!!
Beverly Hills Juice Club is a fraction of the price and does not have all the bells and whistles that they are probably making up for in cost with the zillion dollar shake.
I don’t see how anyone can affords going to these juice places. amazingly how costly it is!

Last week, DC Comics dropped a bombshell by announcing the Before Watchmen line, a set of miniseries designed to serve as a prequel to the landmark 1986 series. The seven titles, plus a stand-alone wrap-up issue, are set for release this year and the announcement set off a flurry of heated discussion among comic book readers.
Before Watchmen is a huge deal because Watchmen is considered by many to be an essentially sacred title — but not this columnist.
Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ series is the only comic book to make it on Time’s list of 100 Best Novels. It inspired books on philosophy, influenced shows such as Lost and, to this day, fans continue debating the book’s ending.
Many of the comments against Before Watchmen argue that it’s just DC exploiting a classic series without the approval of Moore and that the company is using a loophole to keep ownership of the series.  Disapproving fans are treating this as if it’s a defilement that is cheapening the series. And Alan Moore himself has said that the story is finished and no more can or should be done with it.
But let’s think about it from a purely practical sense. For one thing, the argument saying that Moore was cheated out of ownership of the series is wrong — the deal stated that rights would revert back to Moore and Gibbons a year after Watchmen went out of print. Watchmen, however, was such a hit that it’s been in print constantly since it’s release in 1986.
And, Before Watchmen offers the comic book industry a way to get fresh blood in the market. Watchmen is one of the biggest names in comics, and one of the few comics free of heavy continuity brought on by the nature of ongoing titles. It’s a gateway series for the world of comics. Before Watchmen is a way for people with the occasional interest in comics to pick up a book and join in.
And not only that, DC put together an amazing set of creative teams for the prequel books. It’s clear that the company didn’t attach the Watchmen logo to a series it hastily put together to make some quick cash. These are creators who might not match the tone of Moore and Gibbons’ work, but each creative team lends itself to a certain style that work with the narrowed focus on individual characters.
Darwyn Cooke, the creator whose retro style made him perfect for the recent adaptations of Donald Westlake’s Parker series, is helming two books, while Watchmen’s original editor — and long-time comic writer — Len Wein is writing the Ozymandias title, coupled with artist Jae Lee, who spent the last few years adapting Stephen King books to the comics medium.
Add to this the other creators — including Lee Bermejo, Adam Hughes and J. Michael Straczynski — and it’s really easy to get excited for this line of books, even for someone who doesn’t like Watchmen.
Granted, there are some problems with the idea behind Before Watchmen. Dr. Manhattan aside, the Watchmen universe is entirely devoid of superpowers, and on top of that, it presents the struggle between superheroes and villains as a dull, colorless world. Moore and Gibbons made an effort to play up the banality of it all.
Unless the creative teams want to alter the world they’re setting their stories in— which is unlikely, considering Watchmen’s revered status and the amount of effort being put into these prequels by DC — there’s a strong chance these series will find themselves constrained and unable to offer a truly strong story.
At the same time, there’s the fear these might serve solely to offer jokes about Watchmen itself. Much of the characters’ backgrounds were already explained in the main series, so could these just be four to six issues focusing on asking readers if they caught that foreshadowing of Rorschach’s absolutist lunacy or Ozymandias’s idealism?
It will take a lot of creativity to find fresh stories inWatchmen’s established history. The creators are capable, but it’s still a daunting challenge.
But even if Before Watchmen falls into those pitfalls, it’s still a good thing for the industry. Watchmen is a milestone for comic books, and this is a way to draw readers in. Yet, these series, going off of the quality and talent of those involved, could be good and enhance the Watchmen universe. If it isn’t, Watchmen will still stand on its own, and not be dragged down by these prequels.

The causes might have changed, but the spirit remains the same.
Iconic jazz instrumentalist Hugh Masekela is no longer fighting against apartheid or the incarceration of Nelson Mandela in his native home of South Africa, but the 72-year-old trumpeter is still far from satisfied.
In fact, it’s social issues that still seem to occupy his mind the most.
“Until we realize that we are the same people, as long as we recognize the colonial borders, really nothing else changes much,” Masekela said, his infectious energy evident in his words.
His dedication is obvious: One of Masekela’s biggest hits is called “Bring Him Home (Nelson Mandela),” so it’s clear his drive to call out injustice is not new.
“It is incumbent upon every human being to oppose injustice. I am not into music because I am taking a political stance — I am a human being and injustice is rife all over the world,” Masekela said. “If we don’t talk about it, and we think that it is just the duty of certain people in society, or [that] it is a duty of an artist to object against injustice, then there is something wrong with us as a society.”
Masekela can’t emphasize this enough. He considers his status as a musician secondary to the awareness he tries to raise about social issues across the world.
Masekela always seems ready to speak out about the issues he sees, especially those affecting his home continent Africa.
“Africans need to internationally realize that they are the same people. Freedom is just a word, because all we get [are] the votes and maybe the end of police harassment — it doesn’t necessarily empower us economically,” he said.
Masekela sees this passion for social justice as something he has to do as a person and is only enhanced by his being an artist.
His career as an acclaimed musician cannot be downplayed, however, as Masekela is now going on tour throughout the United States with a newly revamped band to promote his newest album, Jabulani.
He’s stopping in Los Angeles to play on Feb. 10 at UCLA’s Royce Hall and Masekela plans to feature his newest songs, though playing his most famous hits will still be mandatory if only out of a concern for personal safety.
“You know there are certain songs that if we don’t do then the audience will throw rotten tomatoes and eggs at us,” Masekela said.
Masekela is also full of praise about his new band members.
“They are outstanding players more than anything else. Together we make an unbelievable group. We play the old and the new, but I think we add a lot of teamwork and virtuosity to it,” he said.
His glowing review of his bandmates becomes more complimentary when put in the context of the artists Masekela has played with over the course of his career.
The names of his collaborators are impressive, including Bob Marley, Louis Armstrong and Paul Simon, among others.
Masekela has worked with legends, becoming an icon himself in the process. But he said he was attracted to these seminal artists for more than just their music. Again, he references the importance of having a social cause.
“I was tight with all those kinds of musicians because they objected openly to injustice. I became friends with and worked with those people because we had something in common, and also because we respected and admired each other musically,” Masekela said. “I admire people who don’t embrace injustice as [just the] duty of other people. I’m not into people who pass the buck.”
Masekela is also currently working on two albums: the first is an extensive box set of 40 American music standards done with legendary jazz pianist Larry Willis. The second is an album with his current group. Both projects should be released in April or May.
Even with all of Masekela’s efforts as a musician, however, it remains clear what is most important to him.
“The fact that I object to injustice is just coincidental [with my being] a musician,” Masekela said. “If I was a garbageman, I would still object to it.”

“Nobody’s perfect.” It’s a popular and common phrase, but it hasn’t stopped anyone from trying.
Someone who takes the SAT twice with the goal of scoring a 2300 might be called a high achiever, but someone who takes the SAT over and over with the goal of scoring a 2400 is on an entirely different level.
Is perfectionism healthy? The field of psychology has had trouble answering this question.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
According to the American Psychological Association, many psychologists make the distinction between good and bad perfectionism. They claim that while all perfectionists have impossibly high standards, plenty of perfectionists use those standards to motivate themselves — not everyone responds negatively to the inevitable failure to be perfect. As talented as Michael Phelps is, he probably wouldn’t have won 16 Olympic medals if he hadn’t felt the need to push for the impossible.
But Phelps directed his perfectionism toward one aspect of his life. General perfectionism, the need to be good at everything, isn’t just unrealistic. It’s boring. More than that, it stifles creativity.
There’s nothing wrong with trying to do your best, but you can’t try to do everyone else’s best too.
Remember college applications? To gain admission to USC, most of us probably exhibited some degree of general perfectionism. Forget being good at a few subjects — we had to join clubs, take on leadership roles and, for the sake of those admissions essays, find some time to have a quirky and enlightening life experience.
The strategy worked at the time, but it won’t work forever.
Now that we’re in college, we’re surrounded by overachievers. The accomplishment checklist has become more rigorous. Perhaps you have a high GPA, but where have you interned? Do you volunteer?
The glorification of the classic college experience puts even more items on the checklist. How many parties did you go to last weekend? When was the last time you worked out? Do you have Coachella Weekend 1 tickets?
The ideal college student doesn’t exist though. It’s merely a collection of standards, many of which have very little to do with one another. Human beings can’t be measured using an isolated set of criteria.
Your proficiency in one area is likely tied to your shortcomings in another. A student with a talent for seeing the big picture might write fantastic papers and score terribly on multiple choice exams. An extrovert might keep up with dozens of friends, yet lack trusted confidants. Trying to perfect every skill puts one at risk for upsetting this balance and undermining his or her unique abilities.
What’s more, many people downplay their own idiosyncrasies in an attempt to adhere to widely accepted criteria for success. But where would Facebook be if Mark Zuckerberg hadn’t decided to neglect his homework and start rating his classmates for attractiveness? Appropriately, The Economist titled its last article on Facebook “A fistful of dollars.”
In excess, all-encompassing perfectionism is literally deadly. The New York Presbyterian Hospital studied the relationship between perfectionism and anorexia in more than 300 women and found that the severity of the two factors is directly correlated. It’s unfortunate — but not surprising — that 40 percent of college women between the ages of 17 and 24 suffer from some form of disordered eating, according to OnlineUniversities.com.
Perfectionism is best in small doses. Practicing an instrument over and over makes sense. Taking the ideal of the well-rounded student and putting it on steroids is a recipe for misery.
It’s OK to fall off the wagon every once in a while. It’s OK to decide that some socially prescribed standards just aren’t that important to you.
In the immortal words of Ferris Bueller: “Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.”
 
Maya Itah is a senior majoring in communication. Her column “Tackling the ‘-Isms’” runs every other Thursday.
Pursuit of the truth, or finding and correcting falsehoods in our own received knowledge, is a form of perfectionism that affects many, and it isn’t always entirely conscious in the sufferer. We are all born into, and raised in, an ocean of lies, myths, and untruths, many of them conveyed to us by people who believe them, and many others by people who mean to benefit us with their lies. It’s around college age that some of us become aware of this, and an unfortunate few react to this by setting out to correct their information (see, Adam and Eve eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge).
Those pursuing careers in journalism/communication are especially susceptible to this threat, but the condition becomes literally lethal at the point where the inquirer sets about (again, often ignorant of the potential consequences) proclaiming, or even just admitting, his or her discoveries to others. The history of the Holocaust, of course, is a prime example, but there are many others.
Don’t get carried away with fact-checking, if you hope for a smoothly upward-trending career in journalism, or anything else. Pick the myths that are the most-rewarding and support them with all your might, if not your heart.
And as for the rest of the myths . . . go along with them. Or at least act as though you do.
By the way – NONE of the foregoing is meant to imply that our columnist Maya is guilty – or a victim – of any of this. But the advice is for her as well as anyone else.

Do you know anyone who has suffered from breast cancer? Are you at risk? It’s hard to find someone who hasn’t been affected by the disease.
Young women don’t tend to be concerned about getting breast cancer, as only about 7 percent of breast cancer cases involve women under the age of 40, according to the National Cancer Institute. Nevertheless, the institute estimates that one in eight women will develop it at some point in her life.
Jonathan Zhang | Daily Trojan
Breast cancer isn’t just an issue for survivors or activists handing out “Save the Ta-tas” shirts on Trousdale  Parkway — it’s an issue for everyone.
Early last week, the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation made a terrible mistake: They chose to cut its annual grant to Planned Parenthood for cancer screenings.
Fortunately, however, they managed to rectify it.
The Komen foundation announced Friday that it would honor its six-figure grants, totaling nearly $700,000, and ensure that a vital source of funding for the detection of breast cancer is not cut off because of an irrelevant political debate.
The political debate on the question of abortion is angry, complicated and endless. The pro-life movement has long condemned Planned Parenthood for providing free abortions. But the recent decision by conservatives in Congress to launch an investigation into whether or not the group had used federal funds to finance abortions dragged many other parties into the mess.
Subject to such an inquiry, Planned Parenthood no longer met Komen’s new grant eligibility criteria, which excludes groups under investigation by U.S. authorities. Komen cited this policy as the reason for its initial withdrawal of the funds.
An outraged public quickly pointed out that Komen was suspending funds for breast cancer screenings and mammogram referrals because of a battle in Washington over an entirely different women’s health issue — one in which Komen has no involvement.
New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg articulated the public’s indignation in a personal letter asking Komen to reconsider.
“Breast cancer screening saves lives, and hundreds of thousands of women rely on Planned Parenthood for access to care,” he said in the letter. “We should be helping women access that care, not placing barriers in their way.”
Political tiffs merit no place in preventing lives from being saved. Whether or not one agrees with abortion is beside the point; Komen-funded breast cancer screenings caught 177 incidences of breast cancer over a five-year period, according to the Washington Post. Those 177 terminally ill women got a better shot at survival because Planned Parenthood discovered their disease.
Komen’s reversal on the funding issue was no victory for the pro-choice movement, but those who are lamenting it as such are forgetting who this is really about: the women at risk of the disease.
As Dr. Kathy Plesser, a member of Komen’s medical advisory board in New York, pointed out to CNN, serving these communities is “a big part of what Komen does.”
Serving these communities is an even bigger part of what Planned Parenthood does. Seventy-one percent of Planned Parenthood services are geared specifically toward America’s underprivileged females. Another 15 percent consists of cancer screenings, including those, thankfully, still funded by the Komen foundation. Abortions account for a mere 3 percent.
This percentage is apparently enough for conservatives in Congress to see Planned Parenthood purely as a societal menace.
Ultimately, when the fiasco was settled, the joke was on the congressmen. Members of the outraged public raised more than $3 million in new donations in solidarity with Planned Parenthood last week. The surprising financial boost will now be joined by Komen’s promised grant, a victory for Planned Parenthood and for women everywhere.
 
Francesca Bessey is a freshman majoring in narrative studies.
This newspaper really needs another name to TRULY reflect what it is ALL about.
How About…. The Daily Democrat?
The Dumbed~Down Idealogues?
The Haters of God, Life, & anything that has to do with Religion?
This paper is the exact opposite of Fair & Balanced.
It is so predictable as to what stance it will take on virtually any topic.
PATHETIC.
RIGHT ON!!!!
NOW LET’S FIGHT ON!!!!
If Komen decided not to give Planned Parenthood $700,000, that money wouldn’t have disappeared – it would have gone to a different organization specializing in breast cancer.
Ms. Bessey’s argument (Do you know anyone who has suffered from breast cancer? Are you at risk?) is dishonestly portraying Komen and conservatives as angry women-haters, and politicizing this event in order to bully people into thinking twice before going against the pro-abortion machine in the future.
It seems evident that Ms. Bessey is doing exactly what she accuses others of doing: sacrificing women’s health – but she does it in order to defend abortion.
Suni Ellis
Komen’s decision was clearly a political one, sacrificing women’s health to make an anti-abortionist statement. Komen had pledged funding to Planned Parenthood, until anti-abortionist Karen Handel was appointed as senior vice president for policy at Komen. She persuaded Komen to withdraw funding. 
Contrary to what you said, the $700,000 can’t simply be transferred to another organization and still be expected to have the same impact because Planned Parenthood clinics operate in numerous areas where other health organizations have not expanded to.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is planning on climbing into the director’s chair this year.
The young actor has written, will star and also direct a feature film that will star Scarlett Johansson.
There’s little information on the film itself but it’s said to be a “sexy comedy” about a ladies man.
The former child star has been on the public’s radar in recent years. In 2010, he was seen in Christopher Nolan’s existential summer blockbuster Inception, but he has also concerned himself with a number of independent films, such as (500) Days of Summer and 50/50, for which he received Golden Globe nominations.
The decision to step behind the camera isn’t a stretch for the soon-to-be 31-year-old, who founded hitRECord, an “open-collaborative production company” that brings together creative artists. The actor has always been interested in telling stories, and so directing a feature film seems like an obvious choice for him.
The film has already secured financing and Ram Bergman Productions as well as hitRECord Films will produce. The film is scheduled to begin principal photography on April 16.
In addition to directing his own feature film this year, he will also be seen in The Dark Knight Rises, Premium Rush, Looper, Lincoln and is still trying to squeeze in a supporting role in Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained.

The Roski School of Fine Arts has established a professorship with a donation from USC trustee Robert A. Day, chairman and president of the W. M. Keck Foundation and a member of the Board of Overseers for the Keck School of Medicine of USC,  the university announced last week.
The professorship will be used to expand and retain Roski’s faculty. Provost Elizabeth Garrett and Dean of Roski Rochelle Steiner will determine the first recipient of this Robert Day Professorship.
President C. L. Nikias said the endowed professorship, the first in Roski’s history, will stand as a testament to Day’s commitment and support for the university and his understanding for the application of art in society.
“USC established this endowed professorship to honor Mr. Day’s stellar philanthropic legacy, not only at the university, but throughout southern California and the world,” Nikias said in a statement.
Steiner said the Robert A. Day Professorship in Fine Arts will help Roski rise as a leading art institution.
“The arts play an important role on USC’s campus, and in society at large,” Steiner said. “Roski’s faculty of artists, curators and critics are training the next creative generation that will impact visual culture in Los Angeles and beyond.”
