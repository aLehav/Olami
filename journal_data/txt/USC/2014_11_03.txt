El Centro Chicano and the Office for Residential Education are marking the 40th anniversary of the Latino Floor at Fluor Tower with a celebration to honor the impact the floor has had on residents over the years.

The floor, named “El Sol y La Luna,” was founded in 1974 and still exists as a place for those interested in Latino culture or seeking a close-knit community to live. The idea for the floor was conceived by Sal Godey, who also served as the first Residential Advisor on the men’s Latino floor.
“In 1972, when El Centro was founded, there was a huge need for a center and for more support at all universities for Chicano and Latino students. When [Godoy] was here in 1973, I think he saw the void and as a student he probably had an activist mentality and took the lead on it,” said William Vela, director of El Centro Chicano.
The anniversary will be celebrated by an event on Wednesday in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom. The celebration will include a performance by Trio Ellas, a Latin-American music group based in Los Angeles. There will also be numerous speakers at the event, including Mary Ann Pacheco, who co-founded El Centro Chicano as a student, and Vela.
El Centro Chicano, one of many Latino student organizations on campus, led the planning of the anniversary celebration.
“Our main goal is to make sure we support Latino students in every way possible — whether that be academically, personally or leadership-wise,” Vela said. “We want to help them in their transition to USC and give them all the support necessary ultimately to graduate and be successful and connected just like any other student would be.”
El Centro and Residential Education also partnered with the Latino Student Assembly and Hermanas Unidas to plan and coordinate the event.
The Latino Floor strives to be more than just be a place where students live. It attempts to create a community and give residents a home away from home. Olivia Ceja, the current RA for the Latino Floor this year, returned after living as a resident on the floor last year.
“I wanted to give back to what I had been a part of last year,” she said.
One of the traditions of the Latino Floor is an annual beach trip to Santa Monica.
“It’s so funny to look back at the pictures because everybody didn’t know each other and now I see them going into the cafeteria as a big group,” Ceja said. “I’ve seen them progress as a family.”
Other residents said that that the closeness among floor residents have eased the transition to college.
“I felt like I needed that sense of familia because I come from a really close family,” said Carolina Lopez, a freshman majoring in biological sciences and a current resident of the floor. “Even though I don’t live far away from home I always want to have someone I can connect with.”
Relationships, including two alumni marriages, have formed between residents and often last long past college.  Fabiola Bermudez and Al Bermudez, two USC alumni who lived on the Latino Floor from 2002 to 2003, met each other while living on the floor and eventually married. They also still keep in contact with other floormates.
“Of course with social media it’s easy to stay in touch with people, but I still have contact with people who I met while living on the floor, including my best man,” Al Bermudez said.
Among those involved in the Latino Floor was an overwhelming sentiment that the floor has created a presence on campus and impacted the USC community at large.
“We’ve had more students who aren’t Latino live on the floor. The floor is not only supporting new freshman Latino students, it’s supporting students who want to find out more about the Latino community and personally want to build relationships, practice their Spanish or know more details about our community,” Vela said. “The program has been able to support these students and many of the results have been our strongest leaders.”

Yiqing Sun, a first-year student in the Master’s of Science in Entrepreneurship and Innovation program, has become the city ambassador for the Beijing organization GirlsUp. As campus ambassador, she hopes to encourage young women to get out of their comfort zones and start their own businesses.
GirlsUp, which is known as GirlUp in Beijing and is also where the organization was founded, serves as an incubator for young female entrepreneurs by connecting them to investors. The organization, which operates under the three themes of empowerment, communication and lifestyle, helps young women to develop their business models and strengthen their pitches. GirlsUp also hopes to provide an environment where young women can meet mentors and form connections.
Sun said that in her classes she does not necessarily feel outnumbered by men. She said, however, that she felt that there were not a lot of women in USC taking positions of power.

“Leadership is a real issue,” Sun said.
With GirlsUp, she hopes to change that. Her sentiment is shared by other students at USC.
“I agree that there’s a disparity between female entrepreneurs and male entrepreneurs at USC,” said Rani Tiruveedhula, an alumna who graduated in 2014 in an email. “When I was an undergrad, I would take trips with the entrepreneur club members to Northern California to meet with companies. There was one trip in which I was the only woman.”
Other students felt that men also tended to have an advantage in terms of business resources.
“I feel like there is not enough resources, especially for women who want to become entrepreneurs in comparison to men,” said Karishma Nagar, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering and co-founder and president of her own startup, Pixeom, in an email.
The Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies is taking measures to encourage young women to become entrepreneurs.
“The Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies encourages female entrepreneurship by bringing in successful women entrepreneurs as faculty, guest speakers, and mentors into the entrepreneurship program,” said Helena Yli-Renko, director of the Greif Center in an email.
In January 2014, the Greif Center and the Marshall MBA Career Center organized the first Marshall Women’s Pitch Competition. Forty female entrepreneurs competed for the grand prize of $40,000.
In the spring, the Greif Center also held the Venture Seed Competition where participants took part in workshops to refine their business concepts. At the end of the competition, students presented their businesses to a panel of judges and received cash prizes. Two of the groups that won $5,000 were composed of primarily women.
Through GirlsUp, Sun hopes to further promote the entrepreneurial spirit of young women at USC. She hopes to maintain the brand spirit of the GirlsUp in Beijing, while also customizing it for the United States.
“Instead of setting up traditional career fairs, I hope to create events where people can just talk,” Sun said. “Once a month, I also hope to create fun outings so members can meet.”
Sun wants to expand to other campuses nearby.
“I am also planning a pitch competition with other universities in the area like UCLA and Santa Barbara, so that students can meet each other and bounce ideas back and forth,” Sun said.
Sun believes that the biggest reason women decide not to follow through with their ideas is because they don’t know how to carry them out.
“They have a brilliant idea and they know their goal, they just do not know how to achieve it,” she said. “With GirlsUp, we hope to teach young women how to carry out their goals.”
Yli-Renko encourages all aspiring entrepreneurs take action and start their businesses.
“I must say I’ve never felt that being a woman is a disadvantage or would somehow have made starting the business more challenging” Yli-Renko said. “If anything, it might help — you stand out in the crowd and people remember you.”
GirlsUp will be holding its first event on Wednesday and Thursday in TCC 302. The organization is inviting people to come for tea in the afternoon so that they can get to know the organization better and meet other aspiring female entrepreneurs.
“I don’t want women to sit back and wait for their ideas to unfold,” Sun said. “I want them to take action. I want women to create something beautiful.”

The Gould School of Law held a panel discussion on civil rights on Monday featuring actress and alumna Daniele Watts, who was involved in a controversy after she was arrested for lewd conduct in a September encounter with police. Watts, who graduated in 2007 with a degree in theatre, is known for her cinematic roles in Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained and the Weeds television series.
Gray area · Watts, pictured, said that she and her boyfriend have often been unfairly targeted by police because she is black and he is white. – Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
On Sept. 11, Watts and her boyfriend Brian Lucas were mired in controversy after Watts was arrested. Watts and Lucas were in a parked vehicle near CBS Studios in Studio City, California, when the Los Angeles Police Department received a call reporting lewd acts, specifically that a black woman in floral shorts and a white man were “having sex in the vehicle with the door open.” The police officer who responded to the call asked the couple to provide him with identification to which Watts responded, based on a tape released by TMZ, “Do you know how many times the cops have been called … just because I’m black and he’s white?”
In the aftermath of the arrest, Watts alleged that she was only “making out” with her partner and claimed that the police had targeted her because of her race.
During the discussion, Shana Redmond, associate professor of American studies and ethnicity, described how black women’s sexuality has been criminalized. Redmond revealed that the NAACP told Watts to apologize to the LAPD.
Assistant professor of history Diana Williams asked the panel about what kinds of sex society deems offensive. She said that socially accepted couples face less scrutiny when engaging in public display of affection.
Watts’ talk revolved around empathy. As a theatre major, she described how during her undergraduate studies, one of her main objectives was to “put herself in someone else’s shoes” and try to feel what it’s like to be somebody else.
Watts said that on a previous encounter with the police in the city of Loma Linda, she and her partner were approached by officers because of a report of a “suspicious black and white couple.” After the incident, she and her partner had agreed to deal with such interactions in a graceful and respectful manner.
Watts also said, however, that the Sept. 11 incident was the fourth time she was forced to deal with the police since she shaved her head. She admitted that during the past interactions with the police, she had attempted to be as calm and polite as possible.
Watts also stated during the discussion that the police sergeant on the scene told her boyfriend that “[Watts] needs to learn she doesn’t get to dictate what happens.”
Jacob Bradley, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said that he was trying to be as objective as possible and that attending the discussion provided him with a more fair view of the events.
“When I listened to the audio recordings, she sounded blameworthy, but I didn’t know that the police had edited the recordings before it was given to TMZ. Now I feel I have more of a balanced view on the incident,” Bradley said.
The panel discussion received a significant amount of media attention and reporters from local networks, including CBS and KCAL9, were present for the event.
Watts thanked the panel and the guests for coming, as she said discussions like these help raise awareness of racial issues in America.
Since she, and others, have been racially profiled in the past, that gives her the right to slander people now and not apologize when she is wrong?
Assuming the author aspires to be a decent writer/reporter, at least get the facts straight. Watts was NOT arrested.
Get a room next time.
Stupid racist hypocrite, you were caught in a lewd act, gee, why didn’t Bill or Monica get away with it?  Because they were white, maybe if they were not they could have behaved like you…
Ms. Watts was very disrespectful and offensive to the police officer, who was calm and nother offensive. Listen to the entire tape and you’ll understand why she is a racist nerself, and uses the race card so much that he t accusations now, haver become meaningless. Because of the content of her character, I would not want my son to date her.

The Trojans clinched a bowl-game berth behind a career performance from redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler in their 44-17 rout over Washington State on Saturday.
With the win, USC (6-3, 5-2 Pac-12) avenged last year’s 10-7 home loss to the Cougars (2-7, 1-5), while also staying alive in the Pac-12 South race.
Win the day · Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler recorded yet another impressive performance during Saturday’s 44-17 win over Washington State, putting up a career-high 400 yards through the air. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Offensive Outburst 
Kessler broke his previous single-game passing record — 394 yards against  Fresno State in this year’s season-opener — with 400 yards through the air against the Cougars’ defense. The Bakersfield, California, native found the end zone on five different occasions during the game, three times to true freshman wideout JuJu Smith. Kessler has now thrown for 25 touchdowns and only two interceptions on the season.
More than half of Kessler’s yardage went to junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor, who picked up a career-high 220 receiving yards. Agholor also added two touchdowns, one through the air and the other on a punt return.
The young USC offensive line, which played its first game without redshirt sophomore left tackle Chad Wheeler, drew praise for its impressive play against the Cougars.
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian specifically pointed to true freshman Toa Lobehdahn, who shifted over to Wheeler’s spot at left tackle, and redshirt freshman Khaliel Rodgers, who started at left guard. Overall, Sarkisian said he was proud of the three freshman on the offensive line, including true freshman guard Damien Mama.
Taking the Week Off 
After taking care of business in Pullman, Washington, the Trojans now enter a bye week, which will give the team some extra time to rest and prepare for a Thursday night tilt with Cal on Nov. 13.
After the Golden Bears, the Trojans will finish their season with two big rivalry games against UCLA at the Rose Bowl and then Notre Dame at home.
Sarkisian is rewarding his team by giving them the entire week off, meaning the Trojans won’t be back on the field until Saturday.
“We need a chance to regroup, reenergize and come out and play three really good football games coming out of the bye,” Sarkisian said.
The first-year coach acknowledged that this will not be a traditional bye week, which usually includes at least two days of practice, and that his players needed a break. Still, the team’s focus during the week will be shifted to rehabilitating and weight training in order to get ready for the end of the season.
“Being a USC football player is not a sometimes thing, it is an all-the-time thing,” Sarkisian said.
Injury Report 
The team got some good news over the weekend, as none of USC’s injuries from the Washington State game seemed to be serious.
After undergoing an MRI exam, there appeared to be nothing structurally wrong with the right knee of sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens, which he injured during the second quarter of Saturday’s game.
There is still no timetable, though, on when Cravens will be able to return to the field.
“We’ll see how quickly he can come back from this,” Sarkisian said.
Sarkisian also gave an update on the status of senior defensive back Josh Shaw during his Sunday night teleconference, saying that it was still a difficult process, though he was hopeful that the cornerback would be able to return to the field this season.
Shaw was suspended from the team in late August after he admitted to lying about how he suffered sprains to both ankles.

For the second weekend in a row, the USC women’s soccer team returned from an out-of-state road trip with a vital two-game sweep of the opposition. Two weeks ago, the Women of Troy (12-5-2, 6-4-0 Pac-12) emerged victorious in two overtime games against Oregon (W 1-0, 2OT) and Oregon State (W 2-1, OT). This past weekend, facing two top-25 ranked opponents in No. 17 Washington and No. 22 Washington State, and with their NCAA tournament hopes likely on the line, the Women of Troy delivered two postseason-worthy performances. On Halloween night, they muzzled the Huskies 2-1 before shutting out the Cougars two days later in yet another dramatic ending.

Friday’s victory over No. 17 Washington was powered by two first-half goals that proved to be the difference in the match. Junior forward Katie Johnson kicked off the scoring early in the game for USC with an 6th minute headed goal, served up on a cross from freshman midfielder Sydney Sladek. The goal was the fifth on the season for Johnson, who is an imposing figure in the box for USC at 5-foot-9. The score held 1-0 until the 27th minute, when senior Washington forward Chelsea Archer was able to capitalize on a loose ball in the box, equalizing the game at 1-1.
Just nine minutes later, however, USC junior midfielder and team captain Jamie Fink put the Women of Troy in front on a penalty kick for her 6th score of the season. The penalty came as a result of a foul by Huskies’ midfielder Amanda Perez in the box. The score would remain 2-1 until the final whistle thanks to a strong defensive second half for USC, who withstood six second-half shots by the Huskies en route to the Halloween upset.
Sunday’s matchup with Washington State was one that had been circled on the calendar all year: it marked the return of USC head coach Keidane McAlpine and his staff to Pullman, Washington, where they coached for two seasons before moving to Southern California late last year.
“I am proud of that [Washington State] team,” McAlpine said. “I know they are going to do great things in the NCAAs. Coming back was a little difficult.”
The matchup with Washington State proved to be a defensive battle for much of the first half, with the Cougars outshooting USC 3-2 in a scoreless first period. Things picked up in the second half, however, as Washington State made a strong push with nine corner kicks and nine total shots, three of which were on goal. Though it seemed as though the Cougars were destined to claw out a victory in the Sunday matinee, the Women of Troy stood relentlessly firm defensively in the back, anchored by senior captain and goalkeeper Caroline Stanley. Stanley made multiple acrobatic stops as part of a five-save outing.
With Stanley and company preserving a shutout, the door was left open for another spectacular ending for USC. In the final minute of the game, Johnson once again found paydirt for the Women of Troy. After winning a 50-50 ball against her defender on a lofted pass into the box, Johnson beat Cougar goalkeeper Gurveen Clair to take the lead with just 38 seconds left in the match. USC would hold off any last second heroics from Wazzu, thus earning a fourth consecutive victory in critical contests.
“I am extremely happy for our team,” McAlpine said. “On a day where we weren’t great, we found a way to win.”
The momentous weekend sweep did not go unnoticed, as two USC players were recognized for their exceptional play. Johnson, with her early go-ahead Friday goal and game-winning score Sunday, earned the Pac-12 Conference Offensive Player of the Week award. Stanley, thanks to three saves Friday and her crucial, shutout-preserving stops Sunday, earned the Pac-12 Conference Goalkeeper of the Week honor for the second time this season. Earlier this year, she became the first USC goalie to win the award since its creation, tallying seven saves during the Aug. 29-31 Notre Dame adidas Invitational tournament, where the Women of Troy won both of their matchups including a 2-1 victory over tournament host and then-No. 9 ranked Notre Dame.
With four consecutive victories on the road, including the two over ranked opponents this weekend, USC appears to be peaking at the right time. Though their postseason fate is still undetermined, the team has been doing all the right things heading into the final week of the regular season.
“At this point in the season, finding a way to win is all that matters,” McAlpine said. “We have been seeing the determination and consistency we have been looking for at the right time of year.”
Now back in Los Angeles for good, the Women of Troy face one final test — their biggest of the season: hosting crosstown rival UCLA, the No. 1 team in the nation. The Bruins (17-0-2, 9-0-1) will visit Troy this Friday night at the Coliseum to conclude the regular season.
Friday will also be senior day for USC players Stanley, forward Jessica Musmanno, defender Heather Davis  and midfielder Alex Quincey, who undoubtedly hope that this will not be the final game of their distinguished careers. The crosstown matchup kicks off at 7:30 p.m. PST and should provide a thrilling end to the regular season.

There are few sports more commonly misunderstood by Americans than rugby. Like cricket, Formula One racing and, to a lesser degree, tennis, rugby has escaped the perennial American spotlight perhaps because it lacks the intrinsic “American” qualities invoked by games invented by Americans themselves: football, baseball and basketball. But football as Americans know it owes much of its basic tenets to rugby. Just ask any member of USC’s rugby club, which kicked off preseason play this weekend. Former USC football player and current rugby club president Joey Krassenstein is helming the rugby team this season, and he hopes to continue recruiting more players as the team plays its final season under the stewardship of current head coach David Lytle, who plans to retire after 26 years of coaching.
Rugby itself could be described, for the most part, by comparing it to a single college football play: The Play from 1982 Cal-Stanford game, where Cal’s team took a kick off and proceeded to throw multiple backward laterals after tackles to continue advancing the ball to score a game-winning touchdown on a single kickoff return. A rugby offense at its highest level can be summarized in that one play, with one difference: The players don’t wear pads.
“Rugby is fluid, free moving, meaning it never stops,” Krassenstein said. “It only stops for penalties.” Krassenstein insists that despite the fact that rugby players wear virtually no protective gear, the game carries a far lower risk of injury.
“There’s actually a lot less injuries, and definitely fewer career-ending injuries in rugby than in American football,” Krassenstein said. “If you asked me which sport is tougher, I’d say football. Because the play is shorter and guys are using protective gear such as shoulder pads and helmets, players go full steam ahead. In rugby if you’re going to hit someone, you have to wrap up and go down with them.”
It doesn’t make much sense in words, but when actually demonstrated, it makes sense: There’s much less to hit with, so to speak, so there isn’t as much room for high impact injuries. Rugby players tackle by lowering their shoulders, grabbing an opposing player around the waist and pulling them down. There are no “helmet-to-helmet” tackles, no “dipping the shoulder” and no players getting clocked on a hit. Because the objective in rugby is to retrieve the ball from the opposing offensive player, not to end the play by putting a player on the ground, rugby requires a more nuanced technique of tackling.
Regardless of these differences with American football, rugby is not for the faint of heart. It shares with football all of the same connotations of warriors entering into battle. At one practice, a player from USC’s rugby team emerges from a pre-practice scrimmage with a blackening eye and open wound on the side of his face, looking more suited for a Halloween party than athletic activity.
“That’s a rugby player for you,” Lytle says, chuckling. The assistant coaches advise that the player get his wound dressed immediately and bar him from practicing.
Speaking of practice, it begins promptly at 6 p.m. in Cromwell Track & Field Stadium on Tuesdays and Thursdays. A small contingent of the USC marching band’s drum line stays behind to practice on the sidelines, the hollow skittering of their snare drums ringing out into the cold air. The team files into five lines, stretching and running uniformly. The proceedings have a militaristic air about them.
After stretches, the players line up at four corners and begin to run with a ball, engaging in drills where they pass the ball — always a lateral or backward lateral — and continue to run. Lytle observes his troops fondly, like a proud, silent general, with a cup of coffee in hand. After drills, players break up into two groups: forwards and backs. Forwards practice engaging in the scrum, a large, ring-like lock between players similar to the trenches in American football — the players in this group come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from a stout, bowling-ball like student to a tall, muscular fellow who looks more like a football wide receiver than a lineman. All the players seem to have one thing in common: really strong legs that will help propel them in the scrum and push the “line of scrimmage,” so to speak, further back in their team’s favor.
Backs continue running in single file lines while simultaneously practicing their lateral passes. These distinctions are largely cosmetic; though there are players “preferred” as backs or forwards, every player contributes to the overall goal in the same way. There are no ineligible receivers in rugby, so even the largest player can carry the ball. Lytle admits this was what made him so interested in rugby.
“In football, maybe five or six guys will touch the ball,” Lytle said. “In rugby, anyone can carry the ball. Anyone can score.”
This aspect of the game is perhaps most fascinating. In rugby, a “touchdown” is actually called a “try.” Whereas in American football the ball only needs to cross the plane, in rugby football the ball needs to touch both the player and the ground — which is, ironically, where the term “touchdown” actually originated. The subsequent kick after the “try” is referred to as a “conversion.” The try is worth differing amounts of points depending on the code of play, but the kick is always worth two points. There is very little individual glory in rugby —no chest-thumping running backs celebrating in the end zone, no exuberant soccer forwards sliding across the pitch on their knees swallowing up all the commercial endorsements.
In Lytle’s team, each player is equally accountable for their team’s success in a strategic way, and all are equally capable of scoring in a given situation. Teams play with respect for one another and out of respect for the game, like in some sort of twisted fantasy world where sportsmanship still exists. Krassenstein sums up the feeling of this camaraderie in rugby with an old axiom.
“I always say that soccer is a gentleman’s game played by hooligans, and that rugby is a hooligan’s game played by gentlemen,” Krassenstein said. “We might tackle each other and hit each other, but we don’t flop for a call or play dishonestly, because there’s no room for that in rugby. At the end of the game, we shake each other’s hands like men, and we can go out for a pint.”

The USC-UCLA rivalry’s latest chapter was written Sunday when the No. 3 Trojans (18-4) hosted No. 1 UCLA (22-2). It was a battle, as neither team had more than a one-score lead until the fourth frame, but the Bruins eventually overpowered the Trojans in a 10-8 win.
It was an electric scene at Uytengsu Aquatics Center as the stands were packed with boisterous Trojan and Bruin fans. USC freshman goalie McQuin Baron enjoyed the atmosphere.
“It’s awesome,” Baron said. “Definitely a blessing to play at USC and especially in a new stadium like this … It’s awesome playing under the lights, night game with a big crowd, definitely brings a different vibe to the game.”
Senior driver Rex Butler also enjoyed Sunday’s scene.
“It was definitely exciting,” Butler said. “Emotions were running high and it was good to get a packed house for the first time in the new pool complex for a big rivalry game. It was a fun experience.”

Not even thirty seconds into the game, the Bruins struck first. Butler scored less than a minute after that with 6:59 left in the first, setting the pace for an up-tempo match. The crosstown rivals went back and forth during first quarter and the score was tied 3-3 going into the second.
USC freshman utility James Walters scored a goal not even a minute into the second frame to give the Trojans their first lead of the game at 4-3. The Trojans and Bruins exchanged two goals before USC freshman driver Lazar Pasuljevic ripped one in the back of the net with 2:51 remaining in the half to give USC a 6-5 lead. UCLA’s Ryder Roberts would have a chance to tie the game up with a penalty shot late in the second, but Baron blocked it. Baron believes this save helped keep his team in the game.
“It was a big momentum builder for our team because if they would have scored that it would have been tied 6-6 and would have brought it back into their hands,” Baron said.
Baron would hold UCLA scoreless from that point until halftime. However, the second half was a much different story.
Roberts, who is one of UCLA’s leading scorers, scored two straight goals in the beginning of the third. Butler broke a USC scoring drought with 3:20 left in the quarter to tie the game at 7-7. UCLA and USC then traded goals, and it seemed the game would be tied going into the fourth. But, with under a minute left in the third quarter, UCLA’s Paul Roberts avenged his brother’s earlier missed penalty shot by shooting a laser past Baron on another penalty to give UCLA a 9-8 lead going into the final quarter.
Roberts’ late score was a turning point for the Bruins, and they capitalized on the momentum when Cristiano Mirarchi gave the Bruins the first two-goal lead for either team at 10-8. The Bruins buckled down on defense, and the Trojans were unable to mount a comeback. After taking a 6-5 lead into the half, the Trojans were outscored 5-2 in the second half and held scoreless in the fourth quarter.
Butler, who had two key goals, talked about the Trojans’ struggles in the second half.
“We had the momentum and then a few defensive lapses,” Butler said. “We weren’t getting guys quite quick enough and they strung together a couple goals, and we just couldn’t fight our way back into it … We were just trying to stay composed, and stay level-headed throughout that whole game. UCLA wouldn’t just go away.”
Baron believes that another key to UCLA’s offensive success was having multiple previous experiences facing him.
“It was our third time playing them,” Baron said. “They’ve learned my tendencies. They know how I play as a goalie and where to beat me.”
Nonetheless, Baron believes that when it comes to this crosstown rivalry, any team can come away with a victory.
“They came out strong,” Baron said. “They really wanted it, just as bad as we did, of course, but with two teams like this on any given day, one can beat the other.”
Despite having lost two of their last four games, Butler believes his team is in fine position right now.
“It doesn’t really change a whole lot for us,” Butler said. “We are still gonna have the same mindset, and we just want to go out and bounce back from these games and correct our mistakes … I think, if anything, it’s just going to motivate us to train a little harder, be a little bit more focused. We didn’t lose a championship here today.”
Despite the Trojans’ struggles, Butler said an earlier loss to Stanford motivated him to improve.
“This whole week of practice, I was trying to focus on getting my shots to go early,” Butler said. “In the Stanford game, I was zero for five and didn’t really get anything going until the end, so I was really trying to stay focused and I was getting great passes and great looks from my teammates, so they made it pretty easy on me.”
USC will go on the road next weekend to face Long Beach State on Saturday, Nov. 8, and UC Irvine Sunday, Nov. 9, with both games starting at noon.

Throughout my childhood, my family and I gathered around the kitchen table for dinner every evening. Coming together for a homemade meal allowed us to reflect and slow down amid the hustle and bustle of our everyday lives. During my first semester of college, cooking out of necessity and eating hastily in between classes, I missed the feeling of community that those nightly dinners provided. So, I began preparing food for my two roommates and inviting them to sit at the counter with me. Even though one roommate complained jokingly about my fondness for salad, these casual gatherings became great bonding experiences. I also discovered that sharing food with others brought incredible joy and satisfaction to the process of cooking.
Fall flavor · Preparing the apple crumble, a classic fall treat, is both simple and fun. It is a hearty dish and ideal for sharing with friends where it can be enjoyed with ice cream or Greek yogurt. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
Busy balancing academics and extracurricular activities, many college students perceive hosting as time-consuming and impractical. Through my own experience, I have learned that entertaining need not be complicated and expensive. The food can be as simple as tomato sauce pasta or peanut butter sandwiches; it is the gesture of inviting friends over for a shared meal that will be appreciated.
In his cookbook, The Kinfolk Table: Recipes for Small Gatherings, Nathan Williams showcases unique cultural approaches to entertaining, illuminating the connections that emerge from intimate gatherings.
“Entertaining looks different for each of us, but as long as we’re cooking and inviting people into our homes with a genuine interest in connecting, conversing, and eating together, then the way we do these things becomes insignificant and ultimately comes naturally,” Williams writes.
This week’s recipes are hearty, comforting and ideal for sharing. I designed them in preparation for the online video tutorial I shot with Daily Trojan Editor-in-Chief Euno Lee and Online Director Razan Al Marzouqi. After filming the video on a dreary, cold morning, we savored warm bowls of vegetable and sausage soup and ate seconds of cinnamon-scented apple crumble.
Both dishes are straightforward in ingredients and preparation, allowing seasonal produce to shine. A convenient one-pot recipe, the soup cooks for less than an hour but tastes as though it simmered on the stove all afternoon. For the apple crumble, a quintessential fall dessert, slightly sweet, tender apples lay nestled beneath a buttery crumb topping. While we enjoyed the crumble with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it is just as delicious the next morning with Greek yogurt. I hope these recipes inspire you to host your own small gathering, discovering the joy and benefits of cooking for yourself and others.
Seasonal Vegetable and Sausage Soup
• 3 tablespoons olive oil
• 1 garlic clove, minced
• 1 medium white onion, diced
• 2 celery stalks, diced
• 2 medium carrots, peeled and diced
• 1 medium sweet potato, peeled and cubed
• ½ of a small butternut squash, peeled and cubed
• 1 tablespoon tomato paste or 2 tablespoons tomato puree
• 2 chicken sausages, casings removed
• One 15-ounce can white beans, drained and rinsed
• 1 quart low-sodium chicken broth
• 2 cups water
• 5 sprigs thyme
• 1 teaspoon salt
• ½ teaspoon pepper
• 2 cups roughly chopped kale
Active: 15 min; Total: 40 min. Serves 6-8.
1. Heat the olive oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, onion, celery and carrots and cook until the onions are softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. You do not want to brown any of the ingredients, just sweat them.
2. Mix in sweet potato, squash, tomato paste or puree and sausage. Break up sausage into chunks using a wooden spoon. Cook for another 3-4 minutes. Add beans, chicken broth, water, thyme, salt and pepper. Stir to combine and bring the entire mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer, cover the pot and allow the soup to cook for 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are fork-tender but not mushy. Serve.
Apple Crumble
A combination of sweet and tart apples, such as Granny Smith and Gala, orange juice and dried apricots give this dessert vibrant flavor.
Recipe adapted from Sinfully Easy Delicious Desserts by Alice Medrich.
For the filling:
• Zest and juice of one orange
• ½ cup coarsely chopped dried apricots
• ¼ cup granulated sugar
• 1 teaspoon cinnamon
• 6 medium apples, mixed varieties
For the crumb topping:
• ¾ cup all-purpose flour
• ¼ cup granulated sugar
• ½ cup rolled oats
• ¾ teaspoon salt
• 1 scant cup chopped walnuts
• 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature and cut into small pieces
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease a 2-quart, 9 by 13-inch baking dish. Place the apricots, orange juice and zest in a small bowl; allow the apricots to soften while you prepare the apples.
2. Core and dice the apples into ½-inch chunks. Place apples, cinnamon and sugar in a large bowl and toss until all the apples are evenly coated.
3. To prepare the crumb topping, mix flour, sugar, rolled oats, salt and walnuts together in a medium bowl. Add butter, breaking it up with a fork or your fingertips until the mixture sticks together in clumps. The mixture should be the texture of coarse sand.
4. Combine the dried apricot mixture with the apples. Pour apples into dish and top evenly with crumb topping. Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, or until the crumb is golden brown and the apple juices are thick and bubbling. Serve warm or at room temperature with ice cream or Greek yogurt.

With a student’s constant struggle of balancing a million things at once, a sudden and life-changing medical diagnosis can be hard to grasp. But, for author Sierra Ann Hill, it was exactly this kind of diagnosis that not only altered her life but also inspired her novel, Guitars and Gardenias.
Write what you know · Sierra Ann Hill drew from her experience with brain stimulation therapy for the story of Guitars and Gardenias. – Photo courtesy of Sierra Ann Hill
“When I was first diagnosed, I was kind of a spoiled brat, disabled people were invisible to me … but Parkinson’s wakes you up real fast,” Hill said.
Though Hill has been writing in various forms since she was a young girl, writing this book was an opportunity to control the heroine’s story, and, through this, become more in control of her own life. After she was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, her boyfriend of three years left her because he couldn’t handle the prospect of becoming a caretaker.
“My first instinct was to write a song like Taylor Swift, but instead, I wrote this book,” she said. “I decided I would create the heroine’s story to be happy and inspiring.”
The novel follows Leah Hayes and her romance with country-western star Matson Daley. Leah not only has to struggle with whether or not to tell Matson about her own battle with Parkinson’s, she must also face a crazy, murderous fan. The plot twists and suspense that fill the story ensure that only a small part of the book focuses on the Parkinson’s. Leah had given up on life having been paralyzed for years and then suddenly came out of it after undergoing brain stimulation therapy.
Hill was inspired to write the book by brain stimulation therapy, a surgery that involves implanting wires in the brain that are connected to pace makers in the chest that suppress symptoms of Parkinson’s. She underwent the surgery herself in 2013.
“It’s like a light switch, it’s that dramatic,” said Hill of the therapy.
The novel contains an inspiring message about being a fighter, and after talking to Hill, it is easy to see that the influence came from the writer herself. Though the act of speaking can be difficult for Hill at times, she still converses with a humble strength. When she describes her setbacks and battles, she also maintains levity with jokes and laughter. It is this attitude that allows the book to appeal to more than just those who have the same disease.
“There’s a general knowledge to the story that could be adapted to any disease,” Hill said. “I come from a family of fighters -— before I’d even come home, they’d already looked up treatments. The way to survive is to be proactive, it’s your disease and it’s your assignment to overcome it, that’s the spirit I had.”
It is not only her spirit that readers can relate to, however, as Hill is also a USC alumna. She attended both the Master of Professional Writing Program and the School of Cinematic Arts. Hill described USC as a dreamland for a creative person and reminisced fondly on her time there. She said that the lessons she learned in the Professional Writing program have stuck with her, specifically that for writing to be high quality, your character has to have an epiphany and that when characters are in a difficult situation, the writer should make it worse.
“So when they get to the point where [Matson’s] accepted [Leah’s] condition, a jealous fan is out to get her,” Hill said on how the latter lesson from USC came into play in her novel.
Even with the educational experience she gained at USC, Hill still struggled with writing Guitars and Gardenias. It took her eight years, and, due to her condition, she dictated it. Finally, the publisher had to wrestle it away from her.
“There is a point where you correct it too much and it gets worse,” Hill said. “I miss my characters. They sat me down, and they come alive to me, like your friends.”
It is easy to assume that Guitars and Gardenias is just another romance novel meant to feed off the loneliness of the reader, but Hill writes a novel that goes much further that. The beauty in the novel comes from Hill’s ability to combine a wide variety of issues and conflicts without over complication.  The book is rife with authenticity and rawness that establishes the book as not just a story of love, but also a story of finding the fighter within.

For the better part of the last century, Neil Young has maintained one of the most reliably diverse outputs in popular music. With varying degrees of success, he’s tried his hand at folk, blues, rockabilly, grunge and country. He even had a brief — and most would say ill-advised — foray into the realm of electronic music.  This knack for experimentation, which once led his own record company to sue him for making music “unrepresentative of Neil Young,” also makes it nearly impossible for him to do anything that will surprise his audience anymore. With his new two-disc LP Storytone, it seems that he hasn’t stopped trying.
Heart of Gold · Nearing his 70th birthday, Neil Young has not slowed down in terms of the strong messages in his music. Though his criticisms of the government and oil companies is nothing new, they still have an impact. – Photo courtesy of John Davisson
Young, who is creeping up on 70, is busier than ever. This fall alone, he released a new car-themed memoir titled Special Deluxe, re-released a new cut of his 1982 post-apocalyptic comedy Human Highway, premiered his new digital music service Pono and has now released Storytone. On top of all of these projects, he also recently divorced his wife and musical collaborator, Pegi, after 36 years of marriage. Though he addresses the split for the first time on the album, the references are brief and indirect. The record seems to be a reflection of his current state of mind- — the hyperactive structure of the album sees Young going from an environmentally conscious maestro to a jive-talking jazzman, occasionally dropping some of his classic lyrical turns of phrase in through its transition.
Storytone consists of two discs — one that features Young singing over a 92-piece orchestra and one with the same tracks stripped down and played solo acoustically. Though the latter format obviously comes more naturally, Young is no stranger to writing for an orchestra, either. He was dabbling in orchestral composition as far back as tracks like “A Man Needs A Maid” and “There’s a World” from his seminal 1972 album Harvest. With help from arrangers and conductors Chris Walden and Michael Bearden, Young’s newest album returns to these grand ambitions.
Ever since his return to prominence in the ’90s with his Pearl Jam collaborations, Young has all but abandoned any early thematic ambiguity present in his lyrics. During what can only be considered the twilight of his career, he prefers to cut directly to the chase. On his 2006 release Living With War, he blatantly criticized the Bush administration, even going so far as to call for the president’s impeachment. Three years later, he released Fork In The Road, which was less of a concept album and more like 38 minutes of him singing about how much he loves cars. So, it’s no surprise that the lead single “Who’s Gonna Stand Up? (and Save the Earth)” is full of heavy-handed warnings about the dangers of fracking and the greed of mankind. Though it’s by no means a new sentiment for the Canadian singer, hearing Young’s signature shaky tone over swells of strings and winds lends it a new quality.
Even newer and stranger is “Say Hello To Chicago,” which features Young reminiscing about the eponymous city backed up by a swinging big band playing syncopated runs in the style of Buddy Rich and Benny Goodman. Though he toyed with jazzy chords and solos in his lo-fi masterpiece Tonight’s The Night, he has never gone this far into the jazz lexicon. The result is perplexing; his understated, spoken-word style of delivery juxtaposes with the raucous background and makes for an uncomfortable listen.
These days, it seems like the eco-friendly rocker can’t put out anything without mentioning cars. Storytone is no exception — “I Want to Drive My Car” fills the quota of automobile-related material. Though it’s far from groundbreaking, the simple blues number is catchy and much easier to appreciate than some of his other recent material on the subject.
A good portion of the record is made up of this sort of bluesy shuffle. “Like You Used To Do” sounds like a more polished On The Beach-era Neil Young blues with the addition of large horn sections. The lyrics seem to be directed at his ex-wife Pegi; the chorus repeats “Couldn’t satisfy you, couldn’t show you my love. / But I kept on trying” before cynically stating, “I’ve got my problems, but they mostly show up with you.” Both Neil and Pegi have kept quiet about the terms of the break-up, but if this track is any indication, there may have been some bad blood.
That being said, Storytone has its tender moments, particularly on the solo versions of each track. “When I Watch You Sleeping” and “Tumbleweed” both celebrate their simplicity of a blossoming love with lyrics like “I’m baring my soul to you” in “Tumbleweed” and “There’s a sweetness from inside / when I feel you stirring” in “When I Watch You Sleeping.” Many have been quick to point out that these may be references to actress Daryl Hannah, with whom Young has been seen at a number of recent events. Regardless of their real-life inspiration, these simple numbers are a return to classic Neil form, complete with tremolo harmonica breaks reminiscent of standards like “I Am A Child” and “Long May You Run.”
At this point in his career, Neil Young’s status as a legendary performer and songwriter has been solidified for years. There is virtually nothing he could do musically to lose this status, which gives him the freedom to make something like Storytone. This freedom comes with the territory of being a rock god. One need look no further than Bob Dylan’s Christmas In The Heart or Lou Reed’s Metal Machine Music for evidence of other aging (or deceased) icons’ questionable 21st-century experiments. Storytone has a few laughable clunkers of this caliber, but is overall a satisfying journey to take. When it is all said and done, Young’s 35th studio album will probably not be remembered among his better efforts. Despite this, for those diehards who have patiently tolerated his less-than-spectacular recent efforts like Le Noise and A Letter Home, Storytone will be a pleasant surprise.

Academic advisers across the country have become acutely aware of a phenomenon they are calling the “Summer Melt.” An increasing number of high schoolers are graduating with the intention of entering college the following fall but end up never completing the transition. More often than not, students either decide to stay home and work due to financial difficulty or do not have the time or expertise required to navigate the bureaucracy of college enrollment. We live in a time when America likes to think it has become more progressive on social issues because education reform has gained political momentum. This phenomenon, however, is a reminder that financial and bureaucratic barriers to college continue to significantly hinder low-income students from accessing higher education.
Linda Xu | Daily Trojan
Between graduation and the first day on a college campus, there are many forms to complete, financial aid intricacies to work out and deadlines to meet. For low-income students or students responsible for their own livelihood, this obstacle course adds to a long list of hindrances. Students with college-educated parents often have an advantage in navigating bureaucracy that first-generation college students do not.
Recently, a national outreach effort has cropped up in an effort to give these students extra advisement and provide them with services like text message reminders for deadlines. Among the nonprofits that orchestrate these services is the Southern California College Advising Corps, which is run by USC. The fact that these students are not only noticed, but also helped is undoubtedly a positive thing, but the situation still calls for a long-term solution for how colleges communicate with incoming students.
One of the primary reasons that college bureaucracy can be so overwhelming and redundant can be attributed to privacy concerns. Much of the information colleges ask for — personal, social and financial — is sensitive and needs to be protected. Not to mention, the huge paradox with financial aid services, considering that low-income students who require more financial aid are less likely to have the expertise to navigate the system.
Ideally, the matriculation process would address issues of accessibility and navigability. Online platforms could certainly be given more user-friendly interfaces, and financial forms could be simplified or condensed to eliminate redundancies.
On a more general note, this trend also denotes a sentiment among students today that higher education is less of an investment in the future than a privilege for those who don’t have immediate financial concerns.
The most important thing to remember about the “Summer Melt” is that low-income students are by no means any less capable of completing college paperwork and getting themselves there. Rather, the headache of figuring it all out might lead them to think that entering the workforce right away has more tangible and readily available benefits. This has to do with how many might not see what they would learn in college to be applicable to the real world. For those who grew up during the 2001 and 2008 recessions, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to prefer starting out at a minimum wage job as opposed to entering a minimum wage job four years later with the added burden of college debt accruing interest at increasingly deplorable rates.
In the end, not only does higher education need to become less bureaucratic and more financially accessible, but education in general must also become a system students can believe in.

These days, it’s no secret that U.S-Israeli relations are on thin ice. Yet, as strained as the situation might be,​ ​tension doesn’t make ​name-calling​ ​appropriate. Several government officials don’t seem to understand that. Published last Tuesday, a column by The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg revealed that the White House is privately making negative remarks about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One official was quoted as saying, “The thing about Bibi is, he’s a chickensh-t.”
Lili Sedano | Daily Trojan
A crude yet seemingly harmless comment that has now exploded into an online firestorm, the official’s remark refers to what the White House sees as Netanyahu’s reluctance to make bold moves for peace.
There are so many other words that could have passed with at least some decency. Goldberg himself keeps a running list — “recalcitrant, myopic, reactionary, obtuse, blustering, pompous,” and so on. But “chickensh-t” is a new one — and not in a good way. As David Rothkopf, CEO and editor of Foreign Policy magazine, told the Daily Beast, “You have to question whether it’s a constructive policy to talk to reporters and use language like that about an ally, or frankly use language like that about anyone.”
Though the “chickensh-t” comment seems to have been made off the record, chances are, this official knew where his or her words would land. After all, Goldberg isn’t just any reporter. One of the most renowned journalists in Washington, he’s a notable Middle East correspondent and a National Magazine Award recipient. Lanny Davis, a former Clinton White House special counsel, said on radio station WMAL-AM that Goldberg “really knows what’s going on inside the White House.” He’s even been known to win access to the president and his inner circle.
Considering Goldberg’s background, it’s safe to say that this isn’t a case of an accidental leak of colorful candor. The dysfunctional character of the Obama administration’s national security team seems to have been revealed in a deliberate move. Perhaps the speaker wanted to send a provocative message and found this the best way to do so. Using an anonymous quote to call someone else a coward, however, is a situation that drips with irony.
Yet again, government officials forget that they’re not just speaking for themselves, but for the people of the United States. Trash talking Israeli leadership only expounds upon the obvious — the two nations are at odds on policy. The comment, however, was a far cry from advancing the national interests of the United States, something every word of utterance from the government should strive to achieve.
Tough language can be overlooked but poor diplomacy and management — particularly during strained times — can’t be.
Profanity and disrespect is unacceptable, especially at the highest level of government in America — and especially when it comes to talking about an ally of democracy in the Middle East. The region is still broiling in volatility even after the end of the Gaza war in August, and insults only serve to exacerbate conditions. In spite of such consequences, people still chose to make comments that reflect the recklessness and immaturity of current government officials. Error in judgment is a big theme here.
If officials don’t have anything to say that will advance national interests, they need to think twice before they open their mouths. Sometimes, when it comes to words, less is more — that’s a lesson the Obama administration needs to learn.

Valerie,
The corrupt administration in Washington caters to the extremist groups like Hamas and the Palestinians.  The Palestinians are an invented people and did not exist many moons ago though they will try and tell you otherwise.  Obumma, as I like to call him, tries to always side the enemy instead of our allies.  Israel is a long-standing ally but Obumma likes to kiss the butt of the Muslim extremists and give the finger to our allies. Obumma will never call anything terrorist though that is exactly what it is and downplays every incident.  Why ask the government of Israel to give up land to idiots that say they will never recognize them and have no intention of living peacefully next to one another. The person who is “chickenshit” is Obumma for trying to force an ally to place itself in a precarious position when they are already surrounded by other nations that hate them. Its funny that so many people hate the Jews? It is no coincidence and the Jews will be a stumbling block to any nation that tries to eliminate its existence.
Are you safer from the global jihad and Islamic supremacism
than you were four years ago? Over the last four years, Barack Obama has:
•Warmly supported the “Arab Spring” revolutions in Egypt,
Tunisia, and Libya (the latter with military aid) that heralded the
installation of pro-Sharia Islamic supremacist regimes in each. These regimes
are already oppressing women and non-Muslims and striving to outdo their
predecessors in anti-Americanism. The Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt,
meanwhile, is giving out strong and repeated hints that the Camp David Accords,
and Egypt’s uneasy but 30-year-old peace with Israel, are not long for this world.
•Refused to say a single positive word about the uprising
against the bloody Islamic regime in Iran, ostensibly on the grounds that
American support would doom the uprising to failure – a possibility that never
gave him pause in his rush to praise the Egyptian, Libyan, and Tunisian
uprisings. He thus missed an opportunity to weaken and destabilize, at the very
least, a rogue regime that is relentlessly pursuing development of nuclear
weapons and has made no secret of its genocidal intentions toward Israel.
•Displayed repeated contempt for Israel and its prime
minister, thereby drastically weakening the U.S.’s relationship with its only
ally in the Middle East and encouraging jihadists who have vowed to destroy the
Jewish state – not least in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
•Readily acquiesced to the demands of Muslim groups tied to
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood that training material for the FBI and
Department of Homeland Security be purged of all accurate information about how
jihadists use the texts and teachings of Islam to recruit and motivate
terrorists. This has led to a government-wide willful ignorance about the
motives and goals of those who have vowed to destroy us, which in turn leads to
disastrous policy mistakes based on false assumptions about the outlook and
aspirations of Muslim “insurgents.” The most obvious recent consequence of this
analytical failure was the murder of Ambassador Stevens and three other
Americans at the Benghazi consulate by revolutionaries Obama and Stevens had
backed on the assumption that they were benign democratic pluralists.
•Kept American troops in Afghanistan without a clearly
defined mission, fighting against a foe, the Taliban, that have so thoroughly
infiltrated the government and police force that our troops are murdered by
their putative allies in ever-increasing numbers. Our ostensible allies have
responded to this infiltration by inviting Taliban members to run for offices
in the upcoming elections, making it more unclear than ever what is the purpose
of the continuing American presence there, except perhaps to demonstrate that
Barack Obama is not weak on defense or soft on jihad terror.
•Aided and abetted the ever more prevalent idea that when
Muslims riot and murder over something a non-Muslim has said or done, the
fault, and the responsibility to change his behavior, lies with the non-Muslim.
He has done this by blaming the Muhammad video for the Benghazi consulate
attack for a considerable period after he knew that it was a jihad attack that
had been planned for some time beforehand and had nothing to do with the video.
By proclaiming that “the future does not belong to those who slander the
prophet of Islam,” he has thrown in his lot with those who are demanding curbs
on the First Amendment to criminalize the criticism of Islam.
•Lent the prestige and power of his Justice Department to
court cases involving Muslims demanding special accommodation not accorded to
non-Muslims. One notorious example was the case of Safoorah Khan, the
first-year teacher that Obama’s DOJ forced the Chicago-area Berkeley School
District to pay $75,000 in back pay, damages, and attorney fees. The district’s
crime was refusing Khan’s request for three weeks off during the school year so
she could make the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, and dismissing her when she
went anyway. Such cases are increasing in number nationwide, with the Obama
Justice Department’s active involvement.
•Utterly failed, despite his many attempts to accommodate
Muslims domestically and internationally, to stop jihadists from plotting
attacks on U.S. soil. In recent years there was Rezwan Ferdaus, who was just
sentenced last week to seventeen years in prison for his jihad plot to blow up
the Pentagon and the Capitol building; Amine Mohamed El-Khalifi, a would-be
jihad/martyrdom suicide bomber who also targeted the Capitol; Naser Abdo, the
would-be second Fort Hood jihad mass murderer; Khalid Aldawsari, the would-be
jihad mass murderer in Lubbock, Texas; Muhammad Hussain, the would-be jihad
bomber in Baltimore; Mohamed Mohamud, the would-be jihad bomber in Portland;
Faisal Shahzad, the would-be Times Square jihad mass-murderer; Abdulhakim
Mujahid Muhammad, the Arkansas military recruiting station jihad murderer;
Ahmed Ferhani and Mohamed Mamdouh, who hatched a jihad plot to blow up a
Manhattan synagogue; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the would-be Christmas airplane
jihad bomber; and many others like them who have plotted and/or committed mass
murder in the name of Islam. The days when liberal pundits confidently predicted
that all this would end with the election of Barack Obama seem very long ago
indeed.

The thing about Bibi is, he’s a chickensh-t.”
These were the words The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg attributed to an anonymous senior Obama administration official, made in reference to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, often called Bibi. This inflammatory statement triggered strong reactions from both U.S. and Israeli officials, with many dubbing the incident “Chickensh-t-Gate.”
Lili Sedano | Daily Trojan
“The good thing about Netanyahu is that he’s scared to launch wars,” the official was quoted as saying in Goldberg’s Oct. 28 column. “The bad thing about him is that he won’t do anything to reach an accommodation with the Palestinians or with the Sunni Arab states. The only thing he’s interested in is protecting himself from political defeat … He’s got no guts.”
Though the controversy sparked from Goldberg’s revelation was problematic (and admittedly humorous), it is indicative of a much greater problem than simple name-calling — a trend of perpetual Israeli intransigence and the U.S. leadership’s failure to tell Netanyahu exactly what it thinks.
In fact, this isn’t the first time that top U.S. officials have been caught bashing Netanyahu. In 2011, then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called Netanyahu an “ungrateful ally.” After his first meeting with Netanyahu in 1996, then-President Bill Clinton reportedly said, “Who the f-ck does he think he is? Who’s the f-cking superpower here?” When then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy vented to President Barack Obama about his disdain for the Israeli prime minister, Obama was reported to have responded by saying, “You are fed up with him, but I have to deal with him even more often than you do.”
The White House was quick to distance itself from this most recent round of comments, characterizing them as inappropriate and counterproductive. Though the response is right in that such comments are not indicative of how one would expect allies to interact, it fails to acknowledge that being a serious ally means much more than refraining from embarrassing name-calling — it also means having respect for one another.
It means that Netanyahu shouldn’t be firing back against U.S. opposition to new settlement blocs in East Jerusalem by telling President Obama that his views are “un-American.” It means not continually and unapologetically undermining U.S. efforts to broker peace talks by issuing damaging settlement tenders on occupied territory. It means not ignoring the United States’ foreign policy goal of achieving a two-state solution based on 1967 borders by openly emphasizing your opposition to such an agreement ever occurring.
Netanyahu’s disdain for U.S. policy and leadership is nothing new — yet it has time and again been met with American silence, inaction and, at most, bitter and anonymous name-calling. Even in the face of Netanyahu’s decision to illegally annex approximately 1,000 acres of Palestinian land — the largest West Bank land grab of its kind in more than 30 years — American leaders offered nothing more than minor rebuke.
Though U.S. frustration with Netanyahu is certainly justified, such actions warrant more than childish name-calling. As a strong ally who supports Israel both militarily and financially to the tune of $3.1 billion per year, the United States has both a duty and an obligation to keep its alliance in check. This means meeting Netanyahu’s defiance with more than toothless condemnation — it means finally telling Netanyahu exactly what the United States thinks.

This is Israel’s real problem:
As long as the Muslim population remains around 1% of any given country they
will be regarded as a peace-loving minority and not as a threat to anyone. In
fact, they may be featured in articles and films, stereotyped for their
colorful uniqueness:
United States — Muslim 1.0%
Australia — Muslim 1.5%
Canada — Muslim 1.9%
China — Muslim 1%-2%
Italy — Muslim 1.5%
Norway — Muslim 1.8% 
At 2% and 3% they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and
disaffected groups with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs:
Denmark — Muslim 2%
Germany — Muslim 3.7%
United Kingdom — Muslim 2.7%
Spain — Muslim 4%
Thailand — Muslim 4.6% 
From 5% on they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their
percentage of the population. They will push for the introduction of halal
(clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for
Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature it on
their shelves — along with threats for failure to comply.
France — Muslim 8%
Philippines — Muslim 5%
Sweden — Muslim 5%
Switzerland — Muslim 4.3%
The Netherlands — Muslim 5.5%
Trinidad & Tobago — Muslim 5.8%
At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to
rule themselves under Sharia, the Islamic Law. The ultimate goal of Islam is
not to convert the world but to establish Sharia law over the entire world. 
When Muslims reach 10% of the population, they will increase lawlessness as
a means of complaint about their conditions (Paris — car burnings, etc.). Any
non-Muslim action that offends Islam will result in uprisings and threats
(Amsterdam — Mohammed cartoons).
Guyana — Muslim 10%
India — Muslim 13.4%
Israel — Muslim 16%
Kenya — Muslim 10%
Russia — Muslim 10-15% 
After reaching 20% expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations,
sporadic killings and church and synagogue burning:
Ethiopia — Muslim 32.8%
At 40% you will find widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks and ongoing
militia warfare:
Bosnia — Muslim 40%
Chad — Muslim 53.1%
Lebanon — Muslim 59.7% 
From 60% you may expect unfettered persecution of non-believers and other
religions, sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon
and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels:
Albania — Muslim 70%
Malaysia — Muslim 60.4%
Qatar — Muslim 77.5%
Sudan — Muslim 70% 
After 80% expect State run ethnic cleansing and genocide:
Bangladesh — Muslim 83%
Egypt — Muslim 90%
Gaza — Muslim 98.7%
Indonesia — Muslim 86.1%
Iran — Muslim 98%
Iraq — Muslim 97%
Jordan — Muslim 92%
Morocco — Muslim 98.7%
Pakistan — Muslim 97%
Syria — Muslim 90%
Tajikistan — Muslim 90%
Turkey — Muslim 99.8%
United Arab Emirates — Muslim 96% 
100% will usher in the peace of “Dar-es-Salaam” — the Islamic House of Peace
— there’s supposed to be peace because everybody is a Muslim:
Afghanistan — Muslim 100%
Saudi Arabia — Muslim 100%
Somalia — Muslim 100%
Yemen — Muslim 99.9% 
Of course, that’s not the case. To satisfy their blood lust, Muslims then
start killing each other for a variety of reasons.
