A crash between a car and a train left at least six people injured Monday afternoon at approximately 2:45 p.m.
The accident was several blocks west of campus, near the Vermont station at Raymond Avenue and Exposition Boulevard. No USC students were involved, according to the Dept. of Public Safety.
The driver of the car struck by the Expo line train sped away before police arrived at the scene and has not yet been identified.
Two of the victims were transported to hospitals for minor injuries while four others were treated by paramedics at the scene, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson Erik Scott.
The crash halted train activity for 15 minutes as passengers switched trains, but the line’s service reverted back to normal more than an hour later at about 4:15 p.m., Paul Gonzalez, the senior media relations officer for Metro, told CBS Los Angeles.  The train sustained little damage except for on its undercarriage.
DPS did not respond to the incident or submit a report as no students were part of the crash.

On Monday, Aug. 19, the Undergraduate Student Government hosted its annual Campus Partners Dinner at Town-and- Gown to introduce USG members to key administrators who will help them with various projects later in the year.
“The Campus Partners Dinner is kind of the kick-off to the school year that we have for USG members and members of the administration,” said USG Senior Director of Communications Olivia Diamond.
USG members and administrators were able to meet and talk about upcoming projects being considered by USG during the reception and following dinner.
“For me, since I’m brand new to the university, I’m curious to see how student government works at USC since it’s a very large body for a very large campus,” Christina Davis, director of residential education, said. “I’m curious to see how it breaks down and how everybody works collaboratively.”
Christopher Carpenter, marketing videographer assistant director for USG’s Program Board, found the Campus Partners Dinner useful for his work in advertising for the various assembly committees.
“I work intimately with each assembly committee to basically brand them and convey a message to the student body,” Carpenter said. “I feel like Campus Partners Dinner, which is to kind of bring us around a full circle, is prime time for those sorts of messages to be laid.”
At a table assigned specifically for USG members with public relations and communications positions, students spoke with Assistant Provost for Support and Advocacy Lynette Merriman about possible projects, such as the creation of a smoke-free campus.
The USG communications officers are working to brand both USG and Program Board together, rather than separately as had been previously done, to emphasize the unity of USG.
“All the tables are strategically set up so that they have certain individuals that students will be working with in the future,” USG Vice President Ryan Park said.
Ainsley Carry, the recently appointed vice provost of student affairs, gave the keynote address after a brief speech by USG President Christian Kurth.  Carry explained the three reasons he chose to be a part of the USC administration, including the fact that USC is ranked number one in diverse campus environment and that USC’s president and provost are committed to staying number one.
“I wanted to be a part of a community that [is] willing to struggle with our differences and [is] willing to realize that there is no one best way to do it, and we need to be [struggling to get] to the best place,” Carry said.
While Carry admired USC’s commitment to being number one in everything from engineering to the arts, he believes there are many issues on campus that need to be addressed, including sexual assault and the Los Angeles Police Department’s intervention in an off-campus party last year. Carry encouraged USC students in the audience to work on solving a social inequity that they are passionate about.
“I’m really excited to see what Carry can do. He said something really cool, that he wants to be victorious in both the classrooms and on the playing field, and I think he showed that he wants to be victorious in more than just those two things,” said USG Assistant Director of Community Affairs Caroline Smith.

After 18 years under the control of Michael L. Jackson, the USC’s Student Affairs division has a new leader: Ainsley Carry.
New start · Ainsley Carry sits down with the Daily Trojan’s Annalise Mantz to discuss his new position as vice provost of Student Affairs. The semester is Carry’s first, both as Vice Provost and at USC. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
At USC, Carry steps into the brand-new role of vice provost for Student Affairs. Though his predecessor, Jackson, held the title of Vice President and reported to President C. L. Max Nikias, Carry will work directly with Provost Elizabeth Garrett.
Carry explained that his new title reflects a realignment in the priorities of Student Affairs. He said Garrett spearheaded a reorganization of the department to direct its focus to “a laser degree on student health, student safety and student engagement.”
The third of four brothers, Carry grew up in Miami. He earned a bachelor’s degree in food and resource economics, a master’s in counselor education and a doctorate in higher education at the University of Florida.
His career in higher education has included stints at Southern Methodist University, the University of Arkansas, Temple University and, most recently, Auburn University.
In the past, Student Affairs oversaw everything from on-campus dining and housing, to student engagement programs. The recent reorganization moved several departments, including orientation programs and university publications, out of Student Affairs.
“Those things were part of a portfolio that included a number of other things,” Carry said. “Now we’re saying, let’s drill down and focus on those things that are really most important to students.”
He explained that moving several offices out of Student Affairs’ jurisdiction shouldn’t reflect negatively on their importance.
“At the end of the day, I think the USC freshman, sophomore, graduate student isn’t sitting around saying, ‘that used to report to Student Affairs, but now it doesn’t so now I can’t use it anymore,’” he said. “That’s not their reality.”
The reality of attending USC, Carry said, is being a part of a hyper-involved and highly motivated student body. He said he hopes to meet as many students as he can and make himself as available as possible to the student body. He said students could connect with him on Twitter at @DrAinsleyCarry.
“To me, USC is like the best of all worlds — great athletics, great academics, the most diverse student environment, not to mention the city of Los Angeles,” he said. “I’ve worked at a number of schools, but the potential for world-changing opportunities? I’ve never seen it more expressed in a campus than here.”
Though Carry seemed excited to start the fall semester, he also expressed concerns about the allegations of sexual assault that led the U.S. Department of Education to launch an investigation of USC’s compliance with Title IX standards. He said he hoped to handle the situation by treating the students involved the way he would want his own six-year old daughter to be treated by her university when she attends college.
“The concerns that some students have expressed about our approach and response to claims of sexual assault are important to me, that we get to the truth, that we figure out a way to move forward,” Carry said. “And I know it’s important to the president and provost because these are people’s kids.”
He also saw USC’s relationship with the Los Angeles Police Department as a hot-button issue, in light of the incident last spring when more than 70 LAPD officers broke up a student party and arrested several students.
Carry said the protests that the USChangeMovement and other students organized in the wake of the incident made an important point, but the university needs to take stronger action.
“I get it,” he said of students’ anger over the incident. “But how do we facilitate an intelligent conversation in light of that context. It’s easy to protest and rally and get angry, but it’s harder to sit down and look at both sides of the story and ask how do we find a middle ground.”
Even as he acknowledged the potential difficulties the university will face handling these issues, Carry emphasized his excitement to work with students and faculty to better USC.
He cited the university’s focus on constant improvement as  tremendous motivation. He said the fact that administrators want to improve USC’s graduation rate, already high at 90 percent, shows the university’s determination to keep improving.
“[USC focuses] not just on how can we be the best on the west coast or how can we be the best in the United States, but how can we be the best in the world. That’s exciting,” he said.
While Carry mentioned so many over arching goals for the university, he said he hasn’t lost sight of accomplishing a few of his own – including learning the fight song.
“I’m excited about learning USC traditions. I’m still waiting for somebody to teach me the fight song,” Carry said. “I know how to “Fight On” right now, but they haven’t taught me the fight song yet.”
Fight On!

Saturday Night Live cast member Jay Pharoah headlined the annual Welcome Back Comedy Show, hosted by the USC Special Events Committee on Sunday night at McCarthy Quad. The free event, which more than 3,000 students attended, was held in McCarthy Quad.
Laugh Out Loud· SNL comedian Jay Pharoah gets laughs from the crowd with his impression of Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. – Anna Schwartz Daily Trojan
Hosted by USC alumnus Jack Michelman, the show featured performances by comedians Jay Pharoah, Brent Morin and Dillon Garcia. Students sat in the quad in a picnic-style setting to view the three-hour comedy event.
SComedy, Popchips, Jarritos, Hubert’s Lemonade and Diablo Beverages sponsored free snacks and promotional items, including plush cats and eye masks, for attendees. Though many might have attended for the free lemonade, the goal of the event from the perspective of Special Events Director Kim Chu was simple — to excite new, transfer and returning Trojans about being  on campus.
“I knew [Pharoah] from SNL so I thought this was great, the students would be excited about it, especially the freshman who had just come here,” Chu said. “I wanted someone people would recognize this year.”
Based on the positive reactions from the crowd, Chu’s strategy appeared to have worked.
“I didn’t know Jay [Pharoah] was performing. I walked in and it was the greatest surprise of my life,” Jeff Levine, a freshman majoring in environmental studies, said. ”It was the greatest hours I’ve ever encountered.” Pharoah, who will be returning to his fourth season on SNL this year, said he was surprised by the size of the audience. Pharoah started in theater at the age of eight and was doing stand-up comedy by the age of 15, but the experienced performer said he still gets surprised.
“I don’t know how I got here in front of 3,000 students. Three thousand people is crazy. I kept thinking, ‘Is Kendrick Lamar here? Who’re they clapping at?’” Pharoah said.
Known best for his impressions of notable celebrities such as Denzel Washington, Jay-Z, Will Smith and even President Barack Obama, Pharoah’s comedic set included audience involvement and invited audience members on stage to take part in the show. Most notably, while doing a Will Smith impression, he led the audience in the theme song from Smith’s show, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
“Characters are never hard for me. Doing voices is never hard, that’s pretty much second nature. It’s kind of like Prince having a hit song. You wouldn’t expect Prince not to do ‘Purple Rain’ or Drake not to do ‘Marvin’s Room’ or ‘Best I Ever Had.’ I like when people appreciate it all, not just the voices,” Pharoah told the Daily Trojan.
The newest addition to the NBC television franchise Undateable, Brent Morin also took the stage Sunday with comedy that focused on familiar high school anecdotes, pre-pubescent crushes and the importance of perspective.
For his USC performance, Morin drew upon his own life experiences during his stand-up routine.
“That voice we all have, I’m able to call out. For me, stand-up works best when you’re coming from a real place. Then I don’t fake that confidence. This happened to me. When I talk about high school, everybody did think it was the end of the world,” Morin said.
For Dillon Garcia, comedy is a job in entertainment where aging is encouraged, because life experience brings laughs.
“I talk about college-relatable things, empowering the people of our age. I’m talking to my friends, basically. Most of the stuff I’m going to, they relate to the most,” Garcia said.
Though Garcia might not be as famous as Justin Bieber, he has already made up a slogan for himself.
“I’m the Justin Bieber of comedy but I don’t give them the Bieber fever, I give them the ‘Dill Chills,’” Garcia said.
Performers were not the only ones who were enthusiastic about the show. Students were also excited by the comedy.
“I’ve been a fan of [Jay Pharoah] ever since SNL. His skit at the ESPYS of Jay-Z, that was insane,” Alex Budde, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, said. “I love his impressions. He’s hilarious.”

The student body packed McCarthy Quad Saturday night for the annual Welcome Back Concert put on by the USC Concerts Committee and USC Program Board. This year, the bands Carlton and Mora Mora kicked off the night and set the stage for EDM DJ and headliner R3HAB.
Rocking out · Students start off the school year with a bang at the Welcome Back Concert held at McCarthy Quad on Sunday night. – Matt Zheng | Daily Trojan
 
Carlton, a pop band from Washington D.C. founded in 2012, originally got together in the summer of 2009 under the name Mercury in Summer before relocating to the West Coast. The constantly improvising Carlton will return to USC on Aug. 30 for a show at Tommy’s Place.
Mora Mora, who took the stage soon after Carlton, is a rock quintet from Los Angeles founded in October 2012. Mora Mora is a five-piece band who began jamming in their garage before they became successful.
Both bands have played at USC before, garnering a local fan base.
The headliner, R3hab, who won the 2012 IDMA Best Breakthrough Artist Award and plays a weekly show on SiriusXM, dropped the first beats just past 9 p.m., and played until he was pulled off the stage at 10:45 p.m.
“It felt like everyone was really excited for R3hab. People were jumping up and down and going crazy,” said Will Lichtenger, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “People were packed into the quad and kept cheering for an encore, even after he already played one.”
R3hab heard about the encore and responded to the enthusiastic crowd.
“I really want to keep playing for you all, but they are telling me I have to stop!” R3hab told the crowd.
R3hab, whose real name is Fadil El Ghoul, combined fog machines, confetti cannons and a giant inflatable whale to deliver a performance that might have even cleared Leavey Library and surely kept anyone still in Birnkrant Residence Hall wide awake.
Those who helped to make the concert happen were proud of their efforts.
“The opening bands were amazing. I was impressed with the crowd we had for them given that it was so early in the night,” said Anna Romanoff, Director of Public Relations for Program Board’s Concert Committee. “Everyone was a pleasure to work with and R3hab gave an amazing show … production was really impressive and all went smoothly.”
This year’s concert was considered a success by many students.
“I fondly remember my first Welcome Back concert, and this one seemed a lot more energetic,” said Ross Lindly, a junior majoring in music industry. “What I liked about the show this year was the diversity among the three acts; Carlton and Mora Mora’s distinctly unique styles played nicely with R3hab’s climactic hour-and-a-half electronic set. From start to finish, I really enjoyed myself, and it looked like everyone else did too.”
The leading reaction to the concert came from the headliner himself.
“USC USC USC!!!,” R3hab posted to his twitter page. “I been to a lot of parties but this was definitely one of the wildest crowds ever!!”

The first day of the 2013 school year in the books, and USC head coach Lane Kiffin appears optimistic about the team as they prepare for the season opener against Hawai’i on Thursday.
REDD OUT
Senior tailback Silas Redd announced on his Twitter account after Monday’s practice that he would not travel with the team to Hawaii as he is not yet recovered from a knee injury that kept him limited during fall camp.
“Gonna hurt to not travel with my squad tomorrow but I know y’all gonna handle business in a few day[s]! I’m working to get back to 100%. Fight on!” Redd tweeted.
With Redd out, freshmen tailbacks Justin Davis and Ty Isaac, along with redshirt sophomores Tre Madden and Javorius “Buck” Allen, are expected to receive the bulk of the carries on Thursday against Hawai’i.
 
CAPTAINS NAMED
After all four 2012 captains headed to the NFL, a new group of team leaders has been established. The players voted redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard and senior defensive end Devon Kennard as defensive captains and junior wide receiver Marqise Lee and junior center Marcus Martin as offensive captains, making this only the second year since 2003 that the Trojans have not had a quarterback as a captain
Last season, Pullard was second only to since-departed safety T.J. McDonald in tackles on the team. Kennard missed the entire 2012 season due to a torn pectoral muscle, but has been a vocal leader during camp this year. Lee, the reigning Biletnikoff award winner, has established himself as a clear leader on an offense that has yet to delegate a starting quarterback, while Martin has demonstrated flexibility in his transition from offensive guard to center this season.
“All four of those guys are on our leadership council that we have,” Kiffin said. “There’s 13 guys on that, so this is really kind of just the next step of leaders above that.”
Though Redd has seen limited playing time throughout camp because of injury, he also received a number of votes.
 
QUARTERBACK RACE CONTINUES
After announcing both redshirt sophomore quarterbacks Max Wittek and Cody Kessler would see playing time in the season opener on Thursday against Hawai’i, Kiffin insists that they are still neck-and-neck and that he hasn’t yet decided how he will alternate between the two.
“They’ve really taken the weaknesses out of their game,” Kiffin said. “With Max, shorter passes and touch were an issue a year ago coming into this camp, throwing the ball too hard at times, and he’s really worked on that and gotten better”
He also noted that Kessler’s deep ball accuracy has improved over the offseason.
 
FINALIZING THE ROSTER
Kiffin awarded four scholarships today to senior wide receiver Cody Skene, senior linebacker Kyle Yatabe, senior tailback John Akiba and senior safety Jack Auran, all of whom have graduated or will graduate at the end of the fall semester.
“Finally something good came of the sanctions,” Kiffin said. “It was the first thing we’ve been able to do that we wouldn’t have done otherwise because we wouldn’t have had the scholarships.”
As happy as Kiffin was to award the remaining scholarships, he was equally apprehensive about deciding which 80 players to take to the season opener, as the current roster stands at 107. He said that injuries play a huge part in that decision, as the team has suffered a high number of injuries over the past few months of practice, leaving certain positions like right guard in a state of uncertainty. Senior John Martinez and junior Aundrey Walker are listed as co-starters, but neither is fully healthy, which Kiffin says is one of his biggest areas of concern.
Uncertainty abounds, but Kiffin appears ready to test the waters with this group of players, hopefully with better results than last year.

Maryland transfer Pe’Shon Howard has officially been added to the 2013-2014 USC men’s basketball roster,  head coach Andy Enfield announced Monday.
The senior point guard was given legislative relief waiver to return home to his hometown in order to be closer to his ailing grandmother.
The 6’3, 190 pound guard adds a great amount of experience to Enfield’s roster after playing in 83 games, including 44 starts for Maryland over three seasons.
“We are happy that Pe’Shon will be able to spend time with his grandmother who helped raise him here in Los Angeles,” Enfield said. “On the court, Pe’Shon will provide leadership and we expect him to have a terrific senior season.”
Last season as co-captain of the Terrapins, Howard averaged 3.3 points, 2.4 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game while leading his team to the NIT semifinals.
Although originally from Los Angeles, Howard played his high school basketball at the prestigious Oak Hill Academy in Virginia.

The 2013 USC defense will look quite different than it did a season ago, and that’s the whole point: to improve upon a forgettable performance and, eventually, do just that-—forget it.
Great expectations · Junior linebacker Lamar Dawson (55) will be expected to play a key role in USC’s new 5-2 defensive system. – Daily Trojan file photo
Though an overhaul of sorts has already been implemented, familiar faces will comprise its front seven, which will undoubtedly be the strength of the defense.
The scheme might be different, but six of the seven faces are the same on USC’s front seven, as is their goal—improvement. Drastic improvement.
USC ranked 71st nationally in run defense, 53rd in passing defense and 61st overall in yards allowed per game in 2012, leaving this year’s unit with much to improve upon.
After the Trojans lost five of their last six games to finish the season with a record of 7-6, defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin departed and became the defensive coordinator of the Dallas Cowboys, while linebackers coach Scottie Hazelton left for a job as defensive coordinator at the University of Nevada.
Clancy Pendergast was hired from California to replace the elder Kiffin, while Mike Ekeler was hired from Indiana University to replace Hazelton. Immediately after his hiring, excitement began to build within the program for Pendergast’s 5-2 defensive scheme, which sometimes places five defenders on the defensive line, and features two linebackers instead of the usual three.
“He had a great interview,” said assistant head coach Ed Orgeron, who coaches the defensive line. “He’s playing five different linemen, and I get to coach all of them. It’s awesome.”
The players are also excited for the increased opportunities the new system will afford them to make big plays in opposing backfields.
“[The new system] has re-energized our defense, and we’re bringing the kind of energy you should bring on defense at USC,” said redshirt senior defensive end Devon Kennard.
Though Pendergast’s schemes are designed to ignite the USC defense, they can also spark the Trojans’ offense.
“Big plays keep the fire lit and make the offense even better,” redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard said. “It makes our offense excited when we can get them the ball, and it gets their fire lit too.”
The five-man front has allowed multiple players to move back to positions of comfort, both on and off the line. Kennard and senior Morgan Breslin are among the primary benefactors, as they are set to become the primary pass rushers on the edges of the line.
Though he was a virtual unknown upon transferring to USC from Diablo Valley Junior College, Breslin was one of the few positive surprises of 2012. He had 13 sacks last season, good for a tie for third in the nation, after beginning the season as a backup.
Kennard missed all of last season because of a torn pectoral muscle, but is still the most experienced lineman of the five, and has impressed Kiffin so far.
“I think so,” Kiffin said when asked if Kennard has benefitted the most from the move to the 5-2. “It’s his natural position. We’re pretty fortunate we changed to a scheme that fits our personnel. A lot of times it takes a year or two in recruiting to match the guys [to a new system], and because of Morgan and Devon, it’s a really good fit.”
The position change also means both will be standing before the snap rather than crouched in a three-point stance, bettering their vision of the field and keeping opponents guessing whether they’ll be penetrating the backfield or dropping back into coverage.
The three men in the middle, the defensive tackles, are sophomore Leonard Williams, redshirt sophomore Antwaun Woods and senior George Uko.
Williams was named Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year after starting nine games and finishing with 13.5 tackles for loss and eight sacks. A highly touted recruit coming out of Florida, Williams has done little to dispel the notion that he’ll be anchoring an NFL defensive line down the road.
“He’s a physical specimen and he works hard,” Kennard said. “When you combine [those two factors], the sky’s the limit on what he can do.”
Uko and Woods fly under the radar in comparison, but Uko earns praise for his raw skills, handwork and intensity, while Woods is the biggest player (315 lbs.) on the defense and will be relied upon heavily as a run stopper up the middle.
The linebacker corps will have to adjust to life without one of its core members from the past two seasons; last year’s strong side linebacker, junior Dion Bailey, is now at safety. The two starters remaining, Pullard and junior Lamar Dawson, both expressed that while they’ll miss having Bailey at their side, his move back to his natural position is for the better.
“I keep peeking in the back and saying ‘I see you back there,’ and [Bailey] still comes up a lot to help,” Pullard said. “If a guy gets past me, I know Dion will always have my back.”
As the middle linebacker, Pullard relays the play call from the sideline, and should emerge as the de facto defensive leader and captain as fall camp progresses.
Dawson struggled at times to wrap up tacklers last fall, and acknowledged that Bailey’s move will put even more pressure on him to make stops in the open field. With junior Anthony Sarao pushing him for playing time, Dawson has little margin for error in his transition with the new defense.
The adjustment to the system will have its inevitable hiccups, but the coaching staff is confident that improved results from last season’s unit will come quickly.
“There will be some things throughout the season we’ll have to fix because we haven’t played [the 5-2] before,” Orgeron said. “But it seems like we were built for it.”

When USC head coach Lane Kiffin announced on Saturday that, after months of evaluating redshirt sophomore quarterbacks Cody Kessler and Max Wittek, he was still unable to name a starter for the season opener, my initial reaction was to brace myself for the immediate, Twitter-induced backlash that predictably followed.
Fans and media members alike were quite unanimous in their disapproval of the embattled coach’s great indecision, feeling that someone already on the perceived hot seat did not need this kind of start to an apparently make-it-or-break-it season.
The criticism surrounding the extended quarterback competition has mostly come from those who believe that Kessler has outplayed Wittek for the better part of the offseason. The media’s coverage of Kessler’s perceived edge over Wittek has created a wave of fan support for a quarterback that most have never seen play a meaningful college snap.
As someone who has watched a handful of practices this offseason (say, between five and 10), I would have to agree with the masses that yes, Kessler appears to play better than Wittek most of the time. Based on what relatively little football knowledge I possess, he seems to make fewer mistakes and deliver accurate passes more consistently than Wittek, both in practice and during the team’s scrimmages.
But here’s the problem with that line of thinking: I don’t know anything about football compared to USC’s coaches, and I’d be willing to bet that neither does the rest of the media or fans weighing in on the Trojans’ quarterback battle.
Kiffin and the rest of the staff spend an enormous amount of time around their players, so the brief window that us outsiders have to watch the competition unfold for ourselves pales in comparison to the wealth of information Kiffin has to evaluate which player is best for the job. Who knows if Wittek stands out in team meetings, or if Kessler works harder in the weight room, or even if either actually had a better practice on a given day. Because it’s the preseason, and each player has little to no game experience, we have a very small amount of evidence on which to base our opinions.
When it comes to these types of decisions, it’s great fun for everyone to throw in their two cents, but the reality of the situation is that all of us are virtually just guessing. We don’t see what goes on behind the scenes (and now that in-season practices have been closed, everything will go on behind the scenes), and frankly, we are  ill-equipped to decide for ourselves which player deserves to start against Hawaii. But fans who read how much better Kessler has played than Wittek use that knowledge as more ammo against a coach who they are already looking for reasons to dislike.
Kiffin’s refusal to name a starter has irritated USC fans everywhere, and I admit that I was initially perplexed when I heard the news. But after giving it some thought, his decision to hold off should be encouraging to the Trojan fan base.
The easy thing for him to do would be to simply name Kessler the starter and see what happens, as he would have the public’s opinion on his side. But when college coaches or professional sports team owners begin making decisions to appease the fans rather than to help the team win, that’s when you know the team is in trouble.
Kiffin could have gone with Kessler and made everyone happy, but he didn’t. Some believe his supposed favoring of Wittek is because of Wittek’s NFL body type: he’s 6-foot-4, 235 lbs. and has perhaps the strongest arm in the Pac-12. Kessler is 6-foot-1, 215 lbs., sturdy by normal means but small by NFL standards.
Maybe Kiffin really thinks that Wittek’s best attributes are his height and arm strength rather than his performance, but the point is that he has not named Kessler the starter because he does not yet believe that Kessler gives the team the best chance to win.
That is what’s so heartening about Kiffin’s decision. Though nearly everyone who follows the team believes his job is in jeopardy this season, Kiffin isn’t letting all the chirping get to him. If he were, Kessler would be the team’s starter already. The fact that Kiffin has the ability to not let speculation about his job security affect his decision-making should be applauded, not condemned.
Kiffin’s detractors are aplenty, and they all have their reasons. But among them should not be that USC’s head coach is a slave to popular opinion, for he has proven that clamoring from outsiders merely falls on deaf ears.

Great article! Steve B.- you are one of those fans he talks about in this article…who really has no idea…just like the rest of us. Everyone thinks they have the answer.
Oh, boy!  Kiffin is reminding me more and more of that guy from ucla named Neuheisel.  If this season becomes a train wreck, he and his enabler, Haden, should follow Neuheisel to the unemployment line.
Sorry to say you have no idea what you are talking about. Kiffin’s indecision is one of his problems
along with a few others. He is getting paid $2.4 million to make the right choice. Talk about all the supposed brain trust on the staff, and they can’t figure out who seems best fitted for the position. Kiffin’s immaturity is showing
once again trying to gain an edge by keeping the opponent off balance trying to prepare to defend two qb’s.

After fielding a passing defense that ranked No. 68 in the FBS last year in yards per game allowed, USC has started anew in its secondary — both in terms of personnel on the field and the ones coaching them.
All secondary coaches will enter their first year with the program, including defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast, who came over from California to replace Monte Kiffin. Graduate assistants Jon Farmerie and Kyle Williams join the team and will assist Pendergast as he juggles his duties as defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach.
On the field, the secondary will also have to deal with the losses of three major players from last year’s roster. Safety T.J. McDonald was selected in the third round (No. 71 overall) of the NFL Draft by the St. Louis Rams, cornerback Nickell Robey signed as an undrafted free agent with the Buffalo Bills and safety Jawanza Starling signed as an undrafted free agent with the Houston Texans.
McDonald, Robey and Starling accounted for a combined 206 tackles (eight for loss) and six interceptions in the 2012 season, with McDonald named to the second-team All-Pac-12.
Though replacing them will be difficult, USC was able to recruit some strong options to shore up the back third of the defense.
Safeties Su’a Cravens and Leon McQuay III, who ranked as the No. 1 and No. 3 safeties in the Class of 2013 by ESPN, respectively, will look to make an immediate impact on the program, along with No. 11 cornerback Chris Hawkins.
“We installed [the defense] over the spring,“ McQuay said. “Starting from the first day of summer, we just started going over it and putting it in slowly again so everybody got it. It’s been going pretty smoothly so far.”
Last year’s returnees in the secondary combined for 111 tackles and three interceptions. Redshirt senior cornerback Torin Harris and redshirt junior safety Josh Shaw return as the secondary’s leaders in tackles with 30 each last season, and Shaw led all returning defensive backs with two interceptions.
Redshirt junior Dion Bailey, who collected 80 tackles and a team-best four interceptions last year, is also moving to safety after playing linebacker the previous two seasons.
None of the starting spots in the defensive backfield are secured, though Shaw, Bailey and senior Demetrius Wright seem to be the frontrunners in the race for the two safety slots after Cravens missed significant time in fall camp due to an undisclosed injury.
“[Shaw] probably knows our defense better than anybody, which is a positive,” Pendergast said. “He gives us flexibility because he’s got cover ability and the ability to play within the box.”
Harris, redshirt junior Anthony Brown and sophomores Devian Shelton and Kevon Seymour are all vying for the two cornerback spots.
“We’re not naming anybody yet, just letting 11 guys line up out there,” Pendergast said. “There’s good competition, and the guys are doing good work.”
Shaw and Bailey aren’t the only two players with versatility in the secondary; Cravens and McQuay can play as nickel cornerbacks, giving Pendergast a variety of looks for opposing offenses to prepare for.
“With some of the guys we have, it will give us flexibility based on the style of offense we’re gonna play [against],” Pendergast said. “We’ve got safeties that have cover ability, so we have some packages where we play three safeties and some where we play three corners.”
The new-look secondary will have a slightly easier schedule to deal with than last season’s, avoiding both Oregon and Washington, which means missing a pair of dangerous dual-threat quarterbacks in Oregon’s Marcus Mariota and Washington’s Keith Price. Last season, those two combined for 502 passing yards, 130 rushing yards and six touchdowns while completing 78.4 percent of their passes against the Trojans.
Though Washington State’s “Air Raid” offense and Oregon State’s two capable quarterbacks in Sean Mannion and Cody Vaz could be problematic for the Trojan defense, neither school’s gunslinger has the running skill of Mariota or Price.
The Trojans, however, still close their season against some strong quarterbacks, such as Stanford’s Kevin Hogan and UCLA’s Brett Hundley, the leading returning passer (3,740 yards) in the conference. And if USC can some how make it to the Pac-12 Championship game, they’ll likely have to face off against Hogan (again) or Mariota, anyway.
But for now, the Trojans aren’t concerned about who they’re playing against; they’re still figuring out who’s going to play for them.
In the past, head coach Lane Kiffin has minimized contact in practices and scrimmages to protect his players, as each healthy body is a precious commodity due to the scholarship restrictions affecting the team’s depth.
But with muddled position battles making it hard to distinguish between the team’s plethora of options in the secondary, the team’s first scrimmage of the fall in the Coliseum was full-contact.
“We’ve had parts of practice live, did the whole [scrimmage] live on purpose so we could evaluate what’s going on,” Kiffin said. “That’s why we wanted to play a bunch of snaps, probably more snaps than we’d normally play at this time of year. Because we want to see them play.”
Robey was also second team all Pac-12

The USC women’s soccer team opened the 2013 season in outstanding form this weekend, defeating No. 11 San Diego State and host San Diego in the USD Tournament. The Women of Troy finished the season opening tourney as its only unbeaten team, and never trailed in their two matches.
Off on the right foot · USC senior forward Elizabeth Eddy got off to a sizzling start over the weekend, netting three goals in the team’s first two games of the 2013 season. Eddy scored just one goal all of last year. – Daily Trojan file photo
 
The squad’s dominating weekend began Friday, with a decisive 4-1 victory over an Aztec team that advanced to the NCAA tournament in 2012.
The Women of Troy struck early and often. Just six minutes into the game, senior forward Elizabeth Eddy fired a shot that deflected off of the San Diego State goalkeeper Melanie Vaughn and found its way into the net.
Not satisfied with a one-goal lead, USC continued to dominate possession to open the second half.
After her teammates nearly converted multiple corner kick opportunities in the opening minutes, freshman forward Kayla Mills took control of the game. In her first collegiate match, the rookie showed great skill and experience beyond her years, weaving through the SDSU defense for a beautiful goal in the 56th minute.
Minutes later, Mills was at it again with an excellent cross that set up sophomore midfielder Jamie Fink, who put the Trojans up 3-0.
In the 70th minute, the Aztecs avoided a shutout with a long-distance goal from Hannah Keane. It was the only blemish on a stellar day for the USC back line.
Sophomore Marlee Carrillo, redshirt junior Mia Bruno, freshman Mandy Freeman and senior Autumn Altamirano held down the back line for USC’s defense, only allowing four Aztec shots on goal. The Women of Troy finished the match with a 16-9 shot advantage.
“It’s totally different than last year. I think our chemistry is really helping us out,” Fink said about her team’s offensive and defensive balance. “It is very enjoyable. We’re playing proper soccer now.”
Eddy netted her second goal in the 89th minute, putting the icing on the cake for an outstanding victory to begin the 2013 season.
“Team effort, team win, lot of great teammates supporting me,” Eddy said. “It was awesome. All team.”
Sunday’s matchup pitted the Women of Troy against host San Diego, and the team again looked ready to assert themselves as one of the top teams in the region. The USC attack took a backseat to an excellent defensive performance in the opening minutes of the match, as the back line halted several early scoring threats.
The Women of Troy got on the board in the 23rd minute, when a corner kick from Eddy once again found its way to Fink, who deposited the ball in the back of the net.
Freshman forward Tanya Samarzich then took the game by storm. In the 29th minute, Samarzich launched a rocket from long range that cleared USD goalkeeper Michelle Craft’s reach for her first collegiate goal. Two minutes later, she received a nice pass from Altamirano in the box and converted for a second goal.
The Women of Troy refused to let up in the second half. Freshman forward Rachel Smith assisted Eddy for the USC’s eighth and final goal of the weekend in the 70th minute. The Toreros scored a pair of goals in the game’s waning minutes, but it was too little, too late.
“We were just focusing on our gameplan and what we needed to do,” Fink said. “We played as a unit, we played as a team. We did what each other needed, and it really paid off.”
Fink attributed her strong offensive showing to the hard work of her teammates.
“I couldn’t have done it without Kayla Mills’ cross or Elizabeth’s cross,” she said. “They’ve been giving me perfect silver platters to put away.”
After scoring in both contests, Fink and Eddy were named to the All-Tournament Team.
The Women of Troy will play their home opener on Friday at 3 p.m. vs. Cal State Northridge at McAlister Field.

Coming this fall: all new reality TV series Long Island Landscapers and Meet the Tanners, giving you a glimpse into the lives of the hottest men and women around. No, these won’t actually premiere this fall, they’re part of a PBS ad campaign poking fun at reality TV. But for many network executives, finding a way to counter declining viewership on some of the longest-running reality TV shows is anything but funny.
Just two years ago, reality TV was popping up everywhere, whether it was the newest Bachelor gracing the cover of People Magazine, or the College Board asking about the genre on the SAT. In the past year, ratings for shows such as American Idol and Dancing with the Stars might have fallen sharply, but the genre itself might be here to stay.
“On most shows, ratings will decline after 10-plus years,” said Ron Simon, curator at the Paley Center for Media. “What networks are working on now is the idea of rejuvenating reality concepts.”
Simon warns that when producers like those of American Idol start to multitask and produce multiple other shows, it can lead to a decline in quality. American Idol’s season 12 finale in May drew 14.3 million viewers, down 33 percent from the previous year’s finale according to Nielsen, a global information and measurement company that tabulates TV ratings. It was the first time an Idol finale had fewer than 20 million viewers.
One possible reason for this decline is simply that viewers have matured and unlike scripted shows, which can mature with their audience, long running reality TV shows remain more stagnant. Julianna Paul, a sophomore majoring in Spanish, admits she watched numerous reality TV shows throughout middle school and earlier in high school, but says the novelty of reality TV has begun to wear off.
“My peers and I became completely entranced by those shows,” Paul said. “In middle school, or even elementary school, it was fascinating and new to witness certain celebrities ‘behind the scenes’ or to see Heidi Montag and Lauren Conrad fight for the thousandth time. But then we started to have our own real experiences and not many of us had relationships and experiences that were as ridiculous as the ones presented to us through reality TV shows.”
Still, Simon says that reality TV defied the expectations of early critics — many of whom saw it simply as a “flash in the pan” — and that it has proven itself as a viable genre.
“There’s an immediate identification with the idea of seeing someone like yourself on television as opposed to seeing someone trained deliver lines,” Simon said about the appeal of reality TV, adding that many up-and-coming cable networks have established themselves as legitimate competitors by producing reality series such as A&E’s Duck Dynasty.
According to Simon, the plethora of subjects covered by reality TV is part of what makes it so entertaining. Reality shows seem to cover every topic, from 20-somethings partying on the Jersey Shore to sassy housewives.
This year, channels such as USA and TNT that have produced successful drama series also began breaking into the reality TV market with shows such as The Moment, Summer Camp and The Hero.
And despite the drop in ratings, people are still watching: in the last week of July, for example, two reality shows, The Challenge: Rivals II and Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, were the top rated cable originals.
Audrey Chai, a sophomore majoring in psychology, said she still enjoys watching reality TV and has noticed a shift in the subject matter of the shows themselves.
“A lot of new reality TV shows highlight this theme of grand scale living and like to give their audience a glimpse into the very tiny portion of the population that gets to live extremely rich lives,” Chai said.
One such show, E!’s Keeping Up With the Kardashians, launched its eighth season in June, averaging 3 million viewers, a 6 percent improvement from last summer’s opener as well as making it the most-watched premiere in three years.
Simon notes that scripted comedies have recently adapted the documentary style of reality TV shows such as Kardashians, creating the mockumentary format popular with shows such as The Office and Modern Family.
Brittany Fleck, a freshman majoring in human development and aging, said she prefers the dramatic depth of scripted shows that allow her to invest in characters and story lines.
“The more continuous plots give me something to look forward to when I watch the show each week,” Fleck said.
Simon says people often see reality TV as a guilty pleasure, yet networks see it as a way to counterprogram and balance their various scripted shows. Furthermore, the advent of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have presented shows with new ways to engage the audience and promote online discussion. And perhaps most importantly, the various subcategories of reality TV broaden its appeal — something that would be integral to sustaining the genre into the future.
“It’s something almost the whole family can talk about,” Simon said. “You probably can’t get the whole family involved in Breaking Bad but reality TV can appeal to different demographics.”

No one, not even the late Steve Jobs, can say that they know everything about technology. Jobs might have come the closest to possessing knowledge about all things tech, but even he did not know every single programming language nor every startup in Silicon Valley.
The simple life · Your Extra Life gives users a false sense of accomplishment by rewarding users for incredibly simple tasks. – Sara Clayton | Daily Trojan
As a college student, tech is unavoidable. Apps such as Snapchat and Instagram play a significant role in today’s culture, and as a millennial, it’s fascinating to observe how tech is coming to shape our wired, Buzzfeed-loving society. In particular, gamification, which recreates the feeling of seeing your hard work pay off or being recognized, is a concept that is becoming normalized as our love affair with instant gratification continues.
Gamification is nothing new. In elementary school, it’s common for children to make games out of otherwise tedious tasks. Even in college, students are perhaps all too familiar with games such as king’s cup and beer pong, which add a gamified element to social drinking. In other words, “gamification” is an updated and digital-friendly version of such phrases as “positive reinforcement” and “extrinsic motivation.”
But these days, gamification stands out from these other ways of making tasks easier to complete because it is both simple to incorporate into non-gaming platforms and, best of all, cheap if not free to implement.
One example of gamification in action is Khan Academy. Khan Academy was founded by MIT graduate Salman Khan back in 2006, this nonprofit organization started out as a website featuring a collection of math lessons broadcasted through YouTube. But as the website continued to grow, so did Khan’s ambitions for his brainchild. After adding more topics to the site, in 2010, the Khan Academy team introduced six types of badges that users could earn by watching videos and solving problems. The more videos a user watches, the more objectives and badges he or she will achieve and, as a result, the more the user will learn.
There’s also YourExtraLife, an iOS app that gamifies — yes — your life. The app isn’t as daunting as it sounds. Rather, it’s another way to keep you entertained and encourage you to break out of your comfort zone. In this app, there are several categories to choose from including “Geek,” “Culture” and “Romance.” Within these categories, there are challenges pertaining to each respective theme that must be completed in order to unlock more new challenges. With every challenge that gets completed, users move onto higher levels and are rewarded a variety of in-game nicknames.
For the most part, when various apps are interlaced with elements of gamification, the results are fairly successful (when executed well, that is). With 15 million registered users, Khan Academy boasts six million active monthly users — 40 percent of its overall user base. Apple’s Game Center, which serves as the archetype of gamification, has more than 240 million people connected. In addition to the previous examples, popular apps such as Nike Training Club also use this type of user retention model, pushing users to train harder in order to unlock extra workouts and badges.
Reaping real-life results from free and virtual rewards is effective in terms of cost and productivity. This all might sound too good to be true, though. And maybe it is.
Rewards in gamified apps and websites tend to be easier to achieve. While the reward after writing a 10-page essay tends to be a feeling of accomplishment or relief, when it comes to YourExtraLife, sometimes all one needs to do is take a photo or a screenshot to complete a challenge.
Though we’re not lab rats, it’s the exposure to these kinds of low-effort, high-reward scenarios that notoriously earned Generation Y the labels “lazy, entitled, selfish and shallow” by Joel Stein in a May issue of Time.
But as a member of this generation, this push towards gamifying just about everything might not be so much a reflection of millennials as it is a reflection of what has become of society in this day and age.
Because tech continues to get newer, faster and more advanced, our generation is becoming more difficult to satisfy. We never had to deal with massive computers or giant game consoles. We’re in an age where more than half of all adult Americans own smartphones and, on average, smartphone-users check their phones every 6.5 minutes.
While millennials are surrounded by so many other distractions, gamification is one way of capturing their attention. Call it entitlement, but it’s more like keeping up with the times.
It is sad, however, to think that the next generation of young people might always need something to keep them going. Be it Google Glass applications or robots that can encourage us based on what we’re doing, the next level of gamification is due – and it’s more than possible if it isn’t already underway.

At first I thought I found an article which criticizes gamification, which I would highly welcome in the current hype stage gamification is in. However, I miss the lack of understanding of the concept in this article: Even though I like that you highlight that gamification and its psychological origins from games is not new, restraining gamification to “positive reinforcement” and “extrinsic motivation” is simply a superficial act. 
The concept of (proper) gamification goes far beyond feedback and extrinsic rewards, which may be overshadowed by the abundance of news articles and gamification implementations focusing solely on points, badges and leaderboards (PBL). Reinforcing intrinsic motivation, creating meaning through bigger goals or collaboration as well as designing a positive flow experience are just a few examples.
However, maybe this article can have a good influence on people by getting them thinking more deeply about the topic in order to design proper gamification. This means not to fall for the “quick and dirty” but predominant way of gamifying (PBL), which you described as the current stage.
Would love to discuss further:

Of all the things Sean Anderson  — a.k.a. “Big Sean” — was known for as a rapper, it certainly wasn’t his skills as an emcee. After all, this was the man whose most successful single has a hook that repeats the word “a–” 15 times  and calls it a day, and the same man who could be held at least 33 percent liable for “Marvin & Chardonnay” and 100 percent responsible for the word “swerve.”
Mixed messages · Big Sean performs at USC Springfest last spring. The artist’s latest album shows his range, but also his shortcomings. The albums’ highlights are strong, but the lesser tracks prove unlistenable. – Ralf Cheung| Daily Trojan
So it comes as a surprise that one of rap’s guiltiest pleasures has recently been producing work that could surprise even the most purist — and judgmental — rap fan. Earlier this month, Big Sean outshone 2 Chainz and Drake on the latter’s track “All Me,” and was then responsible for releasing the seismic Kendrick Lamar-carried track “Control.” Between his myriad of guest appearances, his relationship with Glee star Naya Rivera and the constant grind of being on tour, Big Sean seems to have drastically improved his mic skills since Finally Famous — and these skills are put to the test in his sophomore effort Hall of Fame.
Hall of Fame is a far more artistically credible effort than Sean’s solo debut, and while Sean risks alienating fans of Finally Famous, his willingness to stay true to his personal vision for the album results in a flawed but inspirational work.
The album begins on a high note with “Nothing is Stopping You,”  where Sean recounts his humble beginnings, including the time he famously rapped for mentor and boss Kanye West outside a Detroit radio station in an effort to secure a record deal.  The track then jumps to when Sean finds himself on the other side of the encounter at an airport as a young emcee begs Sean’s ear for an opportunity to rap a verse. The track reveals Sean’s uncanny gift for storytelling — it’s an incredible story that’s only made more impressive by Sean’s knack for peeling away the plot with his trademark laidback delivery.
The single “Fire” received attention for its music video, which starred Miley Cyrus. What might get lost behind the legs of an uncomfortably grown-up Cyrus, however, is an exuberant beat consisting of looped tribal shouts punctuated by stomping bass kicks and soulful piano chord melodies. Producer DJ Camper manages to unify these elements into a warm, genuinely uplifting track. Sean is no slouch on the mic, either, employing some slick wordplay: “Not everybody got a dad but they got an Uncle Sam/ and he ain’t come around ‘til I made a hundred grand.” His verses are a marked departure from his former asinine fascination with female posteriors.
Unfortunately, the album then starts to go downhill from its (admittedly high) peak. Much of Big Sean’s lyrical content in the middle tracks like “10 2 10” and “Beware” consist of espousing the virtues of his work ethic or angsty treatises on women and unhealthy relationships.
The flagging quality of the middle tracks reveals Hall of Fame’s biggest weakness: it’s too damn long. Hall of Fame runs 14 full-length tracks  with completely useless skits  fused at the end of a handful of them.
The downward progression of the album’s quality bottoms out with the track “MILF,” a woozy, unlistenable plate of garbage that invokes Sean’s old demons of hypersexual lyrics as they pertain to — you guessed it — the daytime soap demographic. Nicki Minaj makes an especially annoying cameo and Juicy J sounds extremely uninspired as he masterfully rhymes the words “mind,” “nine” and “mine.”
One thing that could be salvaged from the guest appearances on the album is how much Sean’s verses stand out on these tracks this time around. On songs like last year’s “Clique,” Sean’s lyrically amateurish verses paled in comparison to the likes of Jay-Z and Kanye West. The result of that ill-fated appearance was the hip-hop equivalent of hammering a four year-old’s finger paintings on the walls of the Louvre. On Hall of Fame, though, Sean comfortably holds his own against veteran Nas on “First Chain”  and completely outclasses Lil Wayne on “Beware.”
Sean shines brightest as an emcee when the subject matter tends towards more sensitive topics. Against a somber wave of pianos and boom-bap drums on “World Ablaze,” Sean encapsulates the emotional aporia of reassuring the people he cares about in times of tragedy despite his personal belief that things won’t get better. Speaking about a friend whose mother is dying of breast cancer, he raps “what’s a girl to do, a girl to do, / when her world’s a pool? / and she comes up for air, and it’s walls of flame / and all the stress is all propane.” The poignant, slice-of-life verses practically run into the arms of a chorus sung by Sean and James Fauntleroy.
Despite the emotional richness of tracks like “World Ablaze” and “Ashley” (a song dedicated to his ex-girlfriend), Sean manages to sidestep the schmaltz by the self-assured quality of his lyrics paired with deep, relaxed vocal deliveries. Hall of Fame is at its best when Sean broaches topics of emotional depth, which give him an opportunity to showcase wisdom beyond his years while not sounding overtly dramatic or preachy.  And while the album certainly has its weak spots, Hall of Fame is a dramatic improvement in subject matter and execution over his debut album Finally Famous.

A new school year means a fresh start, fresh faces, and this year at USC, fresh food. USC Hospitality is introducing some new and affordable places to eat on campus that are sure to be a hit with students of all different tastes.
Bon appetit · New dining options on campus explore the diverse array of cultures represented by the student body at USC, with options such as No Tomatoes, an Indian restaurant with on-the-go convenience. – Alegra Hueso | Daily Trojan
Returning students already know and love the popular restaurants at the Tutor Campus Center (TCC) such as Lemonade, Seeds, Panda Express and California Pizza Kitchen. Joining them is the newest member of the TCC family, Verde, a “Chipotle-esque restaurant,” according to Ron Baker, senior manager of USC Hospitality. “But we’re not Chipotle,” he said. “We’re better.” Such a forthright statement isn’t just talk; after all, there’s a USC reputation to uphold.
“What sets us apart from the rest is that we are fresh, and we pride ourselves on freshness,” said kitchen manager and chef Edward Rodriguez. “We make everything that day. We bring fresh ingredients from local places, and everything is grown here in California. For example, our tortillas are from a Los Angeles tortillería (tortilla factory) called La Fortaleza.”
The bold flavors of ancho chiles, lime, chipotle, adobo, garlic and oregano infuse the Verde menu, which includes burritos, burrito bowls, tacos and nachos, along with an abundance of fresh pico de gallo and guacamole. A variety of aguas frescas (“fresh waters” in Spanish) are also offered. “We plan on switching up the flavors every month or so,”  Rodriguez said. “Right now we’re serving cantaloupe, strawberry guava and watermelon.”
Verde can be found in the old Wahoo’s Fish Tacos location and is already a hit with students. Rachel Latterich, a sophomore majoring in Public Relations is pleased with one difference. “I love refried beans and that was the reason why I never went to Chipotle, because they didn’t have refried beans, but Verde does,” Latterich said.
Neeraj Patel, or “Raj,” as most people call him, is a USC Viterbi School of Engineering graduate who followed his passion for food. He created a name for himself as the owner of the No Tomatoes! Indian Cafe near the Beverly Center as well as the popular No Tomatoes! food truck, which serves fresh Indian food in an American to-go style. Patel has partnered with USC Hospitality to open a second No Tomatoes!, fittingly located within his old stomping grounds, the Viterbi School of Engineering’s Ronald Tutor Hall.
“USC has given me a great opportunity and a great education,” Patel said. “I’m following my passion while still doing my regular job [as an engineer], and I think that this is a great opportunity for me to give back to the community and to the school that has given me so much.”
The No Tomatoes! Cafe will offer such classic Indian dishes as spinach chana, crunchy potato and pea samosas, and savory chicken vindaloo.
Director of USC Hospitality Kris Klinger said the new food options are also a reflection of the cultural diversity of its student body.
“Ultimately, the goal of USC Hospitality is to provide for the students no matter what their ethnicity or background,” Klinger said. “Bringing the foods to USC that students would normally eat at home creates a safer and familiar environment for students as well as benefitting the school.”
Aiming to please the customer and serve up the most authentic cuisine on campus, Tutor Hall Cafe has introduced a Southeast Asian-inspired bistro, adjacent to No Tomatoes! This part of the cafe serves up five types of ramen, such as vegetable, shrimp and Thai beef as well as Southeast Asian inspired salads. Executive Chef Eric Ernest and his team will also be rolling out a Los Angeles-area favorite: the bahn mi.
“[Bahn mi] are cuts of chicken, pork or beef on a baguette, mostly inspired from Vietnam and Morocco because of all the French outposts there,” Ernest said. “It’s kind of like a French-meets-Southeast Asian sandwich that is nice and flat, with thin cut meat and vegetables.”
USC Hospitality doesn’t stop there. In order to put the icing on the cake and add a cherry on top, Traditions and Tommy’s Place, the designated “pubs” on campus, according to USC Hospitality, have undergone renovations and are about to be the most happening spots for student nightlife on campus. Traditions or “Traddies,” has always been perfect for fun date nights, guys’ or girls’ nights out, and especially music performances and USC football.
Traditions’ menu now serves Big Country barbecue, a southern inspired classic barbecue joint with all the fixings. The restaurant promises to provide the best barbecue in the West with a signature sriracha-lime aioli sauce, perfect for the hand-breaded chicken tenders, and the Korean BBQ sauce made for the tender half-rack crispy spare ribs called “The Sidekick.” Make sure to plan ahead for the designated daily specials, like the campus favorite chicken and waffles sandwich that is available on Thursdays, and the 50-cent Wing Nights perfect for Monday Night Football. Wednesday is also Trivia Night at Tommy’s Place on Wednesdays from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.
Students will be pleased with the vast array of new on-campus dining options, and should take the opportunity afforded to them to try something new and exciting.
This sounds great!
Hello,
As a Vietnamese American growing up in the Little Saigon area of Orange County, I just wanted to comment on the misspelling of the term “bahn mi” which is supposed to be “banh mi” and hope that the Tutor Café does not use the incorrect spelling.  Also, as it is served on a baguette, I don’t know why it is called flat.  If you’ve seen one, it is not served on a slice of bread so it is not flat…
Thanks for the great news!
-Kim

The shortage of doctors is a real dilemma nowadays, especially under the Affordable Care Act. And in the coming years, this dearth of doctors will only be exacerbated.
Matthew Torres | Daily Trojan
Though there will be 30 million more citizens insured for healthcare, there will not be enough professionals ready to give that care. This is a critical misstep for the newly implemented system.
According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the United States is currently short of an estimated 20,000 doctors, a number that could nearly quintuple over the next decade.
One solution to the physician shortage in California is new legislation that would allow physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists and optometrists more authority and autonomy in medical treatment. Another promising idea is to facilitate the path for foreign doctors to become licensed in the United States.
Unbeknownst to many Americans, there are thousands of immigrant physicians in the U.S. whose life-saving skills go unused. It’s nearly impossible for immigrant doctors to practice in the United States. Current circumstances demand that it shouldn’t be this difficult. For the majority of immigrant doctors, the process will consume more than a decade. The process requires doctors to prove they speak English, pass three separate steps of the United States Medical Licensing Examination, get American recommendation letters and be a permanent resident or receive a work visa, after they apply to a private nonprofit organization that verifies medical school transcripts and diplomas.
And yet, the biggest challenge, according to The New York Times. is winning a slot in America’s medical residency system.
It doesn’t help that Congress effectively froze residency funding in 1997, according to The Times.
The residency match rate for immigrants is projected to decrease more steeply, a consequence of the substantial increase in the number of accredited American medical schools and the fixed number of residency slots.
To make things more complicated, test scores of immigrant doctors do not fairly reflect their talents and skills. Sajith Abeyawickrama, a Sri Lankan anesthesiologist, said that he failed to pass three years in a row but blames it on the new program. “I had the knowledge, but I did not know the art of the exams here,” he said to The New York Times.
And yet, as a testament to his talents, he was recently offered a two-year research fellowship at Cleveland Clinic.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of elderly Americans will double by 2050, increasing the demand for medical services. Plus, according to Hospital and Health Networks magazine, more than 250,000 of 700,000 active physicians were over age 55 in 2009, indicating many impending retirements in the next decade. A report published in the Annals of Family Medicine projected a physician shortfall of 52,000 by 2025. The Motley Fool, however, states that “research data indicated this need for more doctors is 18 percent higher than it would have been without implementation of Obamacare.”
Balancing supply and demand for doctors in America could definitely be helped by “passive recruitment,” a policy that advocates an increase in the number of funded slots at U.S. residency programs and goes hand-in-hand with relaxation of current restrictions and bureaucratic regulations.
Some might argue that by simplifying this process, Americans are lowering the standards of care and allowing less proficiently trained physicians to practice, jeopardizing patient safety. This, however, is a description of “active recruitment,” not the passive path proposed above. “Active recruitment,” as termed by Remapping Debate, entails completely lifting the requirement that foreign physicians pursuing a U.S. license must complete a residency program here. Canada and the United Kingdom have embraced this method.
Complete residency training in America, however, should still be seen as the foremost safeguard for ensuring quality of care. Other creative solutions to easing the residency slot shortage without comprising quality of care are out there as well. For instance, the UCLA International Medical Graduate Program offers foreign-born physicians a stipend along with board prep classes, mentorship and references to help them find a residency in primary care medicine. Enrollees must agree to work in an underserved  area of the state two to three years after receiving a license.
According to California Healthline, the program has placed 54 hispanic physicians into family medicine training programs, a step in the right direction considering the fact that 40 percent of California residents are hispanic or latino, but only 5 percent of licensed doctors here are hispanic or latino, according to Kaiser Health News.
There’s still a long way to go, but implementing these programs could create a promising outlook for the doctor dilemma.

THANK YOU FOR THIS ARTICLE! Wish there are more who would help us have a voice in the press and media.
We have a shortage because the AMA wants it that way. Fewer doctors means more money for the remaining few and no need to advertise. 
With health care freedom and privacy slated for termination in 2014-15, I predict that there will be a great many new clinics outside of the USA that will allow privacy, accept cash payments and make appointments with short waiting periods. Look for new legislation to try to stop people from leaving the country for medical care and “advisory” warnings from the federal government about foreign clinics.
I thought English was a pre-med class de facto? besides o-chem, chem, bio, physics and calculus. Doesn’t the MCAT have a verbal/English section?
Believe it or not, communication is very crucial between patient and physician. A nuance in miscommunication could change the outcome dramatically.

After the suicide of Hannah Smith, a 14-year-old teenager from Leicestershire, England, it is time to step in and regulate websites such as Ask.fm that allow hateful, anonymous postings.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
 
Smith was a regular user of this social network  according to CNN, as she was allegedly using it to seek advice on the skin condition, eczema. Smith’s innocent intentions were met by cruel responses: On Aug. 2, Smith’s 16-year-old sister Jo reportedly discovered that Smith had hanged herself. In order to protect our youth from a similar fate, government intervention is needed to stop Ask.fm.
In today’s world where advanced technology has become the center of everyday life, traditional school hallway bullying has manifested itself in a new niche within the Internet.
Social networking websites are online hubs crawling with countless teens interacting with each other freely, and user rates skyrocketing by the minute.
Ask.fm is a website on which users create profiles for themselves and accept anonymous questions and comments to their profile. It has 70 million users worldwide, half of whom are under 18, and gains nearly 200,000 new users daily.
The Q-and-A-style site allows users to anonymously ask other users questions, which can then be publicly posted to the profile. While the site was probably founded with intentions of being a fun and easygoing medium, this is rarely the experiences of teen Ask.fm users.
Ask.fm promotes hateful, psychologically scarring interactions with its anonymous asker feature, which self-conscious adolescents find themselves hooked on in search of confidence. These fragile teens are more often than not met with shallow questions and comments ranging from, “Are you a virgin?” to “You are ugly and annoying,” to “You are fat.” They will sign on to their accounts to find their question inboxes flooded with posts such as “Everyone hates you.”
Smith’s death has fueled mounting calls in Britain for preventative action against abuse through social media that started when widespread reports of women receiving rape and bomb threats via Twitter began piling up. An online petition urging the government to act following the despondent teen’s death has now reached more than 10,000 signatures, and Prime Minister David Cameron has even called for the establishment of a commission to review the responsibilities of social networking site managers and draft a range of preventative action possibilities.
But even with these increasing pressures, cyberbullying continues to plague the Internet. The truth of the matter is that it is too difficult for emotionally unstable teens to stay away from these hateful words or even turn off their computers. As teen users choose to publicly post these questions and their answers to their profiles, either responding in agreement or retaliating with some sort of witty comeback, they unintentionally propagate self-hate and further injure themselves. Many teens even continue to publicize their Ask.fm accounts on their other social networking profiles in search of more opinions, spurring an endless cycle. Abuse through social networking sites is threatening our youth, and it is urgent that government action is taken to shut down Ask.fm and similar sites in order to put an end to the hatred circulating online.
According to The Guardian, Ask.fm has pledged cyberbullying reform through increased user protection following Smith’s death. The company has planned to modify policies regarding reporting and moderation, registration and corporate visibility. Unless the site decides to remove its anonymous user feature completely, however, mere reporting reforms will be ultimately useless in putting a stop to cyberbullying.
Though considerations like Cameron’s commission to investigate possibilities such as adding a “red button” to social networking sites, which flags out experiencers of cyberbullying to guidance counselors, are steps in the right direction, the fact that the Internet lacks transparency makes such approaches futile in the war against online abuse.
With endless opportunities for bullying through anonymity, if the Internet does not see any kind of serious government intervention in the near future, cyberbullies will continue to sit behind their keyboards trolling social network sites and posting the cruelest and nastiest comments left and right. According to the Pew Research Center, 93 percent of teens ages 12 to 17 are active on the Internet several times a day. Since the most fragile age group is also the most frequently online, today’s adolescents are at an even more grave risk than ever of experiencing severe psychological scarring with the imminent possibility of consequent physical harm.
The sooner Ask.fm and similar sites are eradicated, and stringent regulation of other social network sites occurs, the sooner our youth are protected from the swarm of cyberbullies driving fragile teens into an abyss of trauma.

It’s really sad that young teens are committing suicide due to bullying, but this website is not to blame. Users can block IP addresses from sending them questions, and if bullying continues and users are not getting anything positive from the site, they can close their accounts. I find it quite odd that people are blaming ask.fm for suicides when users have the full capability of pressing the “deactivate my account” button.
Shame on you for promoting censorship and political control over private business, you might want to try Saudi arabia or Cuba if you want to live in a society that supports your train of thought.
Frankly, this suggestion is rediculous. It’s a simple question and answer site where the purpose is anonymity. Hanna make an account knowing perfectly well that people could say what they wanted. Is it horrible she committed suicide? Yes! Does that mean we need to shut down a site just because of an anonymous button? I think not.
Give me a break. Fragile teens? A bunch of teens killed a man in Washington. Teens live in the same reality as adults. For most people life is a brutal contact sport. Training teens to expect a world of asspats for life is doing them the biggest possible disservice.
Regulate the site for 18+, myself and everyfriend I have, have Ask.fm many of us have gotten abuse, but it’s anonymous it doesn’t bother me. If my site was filled with it i’d just refrain from using it. It’s actually ridiculous trying to put the blame onto a site, the real problem is the lack of control and regular checks made on minors their parents should be monitoring their internet activities and if anything comes up as a problem? Block the webpage, easily done. Bullying in school is far worse than insults from the nameless.
What a poorly written opinion piece. Rojine’s claims are unfounded and overly simplified. Just like my comment.
There just needs to be more done to stop the excessive amount of bullying. Libel, bullying, defamation, and stalking are not censorship. They are not even protected speech. That needs to change. I have to say in the United States, the worst offender is Topix though. They don’t even make their users register. It is pure filth.
I can’t believe that companies like (T.D. FORD – SCOTIA BANK – COTTONELLE – EXPRESS etc…) all support this web-site. How you as large companies support this, is beyond comprehension. Your advertising on a web-site will not increase your company sales. These are “KIDS”   not people who buy a cars, get a mortgage etc… They are kids who are hiding behind this anonymous they are allowed to hide behind by ASK.fm – ASK.fm needs to remove allowing to be anonymous and I think they’ll see a good part of the bullying go away. This is empowering these kids to bullying other kids, to the point of sometimes being a part of a young person taking their lives. This so called net work is suppose to be the way of our future – instead sites like ASK.fm  are causing lives of our young people to taken way! The government needs to step in and start controlling these sites with regulations. You can be charged if you assist a person dying of cancer in taking their life – so why aren’t people be charged for bullying people into taking their lives?
i dont think thay should shut askfm down but thay defenetly should have a report button and should stop the anon questions
I wish they would get rid of this website.  My daughter was bullied this weekend and it broke my heart, after she saw what they said about her she wanted to move schools and said she wanted to sleep forever.  It’s a terrible site because anybody can put nasty things about you and it doesn’t have to be from someone you know it can be from someone anonymous.
Do not support any form of censorship!
