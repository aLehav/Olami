Three Keck Medicine of USC hospitals — Keck Hospital of USC, USC Norris Cancer Hospital and USC Verdugo Hills Hospital — and USC Student Health received the designation of “LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader” Tuesday. The Human Rights Campaign Foundation awarded Keck the highest-possible score of 100 from its 15th annual Healthcare Equality Index. 
Keck is one of 496 healthcare facilities to earn this distinction, with 906 participating in the survey. This is the sixth recent time that Keck hospitals earned the title and the first year that Student Health participated. The application process included taking part in a series of training sessions and updating policies and procedures.
“We know that it’s really important that all students are able to get the care that they need, including students who are LGBTQIA or seeking care for a variety of conditions,” said Dr. Sarah Van Orman during a student media health briefing Tuesday. “We’ve done a lot of work in this area.”
Over the past two years, Keck’s LGBTQIA initiatives focused on staff development training and included the creation of a trans-affirming workgroup, Keck Medicine Gender-Affirming Care Program, which provides transgender, non-binary and gender-diverse patients supportive care. In 2015, Keck established the Keck Pride Committee as a sounding board for the development of inclusive healthcare practices to foster a welcoming environment for LGBTQIA patients and families. Keck also actively sponsors local LGBTQIA events.
The HEI evaluates healthcare facilities based on performance in four criteria — foundational policies and training in LGBTQIA patient-centered care, LGBTQIA patient services and support, employee benefits and policies, and patient and community engagement. 
The California Office of Emergency Services awarded Student Health’s Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Services a grant that the program has used to expand services for LGBTQIA students and survivors of sexual and partner abuse through a partnership with Young Women’s Christian Association of Greater Los Angeles. 
“We’re really trying to look at this holistically, both in terms of medical care, mental health care, survivor care, our communications materials, our training,” Van Orman said. “We know we still have a lot of work to do.”

Six individuals will receive honorary degrees at the 2022 commencement ceremony, USC announced in a press release Tuesday. This year’s recipients include USC Trustee David C. Bohnett, five-time Olympian Allyson Felix, filmmakers Brian Grazer, Ron Howard and Frank Price and journalist Bina Venkataraman.
“In an age-old commencement tradition, honorary degrees chosen by a committee of students and faculty are conferred on remarkable individuals who have made exceptional contributions to the university and industry, education, philanthropy, athletics, leadership and other fields,” the announcement read.
David C. Bohnett, a USC alumnus, co-founded the widely successful web hosting service GeoCities with John Rezner in 1994. The site hosted at least 38 million web pages before ending its United States service 10 years later. Bohnett is openly gay and has been active in gay rights activism throughout his life; the David Bohnett Foundation continues to donate to LGBTQIA causes, as well as AIDS services and research. In 2020, he established the David C. Bohnett Residential College at USC Village.
Allyson Felix is the most decorated track-and-field athlete in American history. Felix earned her first Olympic medal — a silver in the 200-meter dash at the 2004 Athens games — while attending USC. She brought home 10 more after graduating in 2008, including seven gold, for a total of 11 Olympic medals — beating the previous record held by Carl Lewis. In 2019, Felix called for better treatment of working mothers. Now retired,  she runs her own women’s lifestyle brand, Saysh. Felix will also speak at this year’s commencement ceremony.
Brian Grazer, who graduated from USC in 1974, is the multi-award-winning producer of “A Beautiful Mind” (2001), which won Best Picture at the 2002 Academy Awards. Grazer’s works have received 47 Academy Award nominations and 202 Emmy nominations. Grazer also co-founded Impact, a content accelerator that has connected over 60,000 writers, and founded Imagine Entertainment with his long-time business partner and fellow recipient Ron Howard.
Ron Howard is the award-winning director of “A Beautiful Mind” (2001), “Apollo 13” (1995), “Solo: A Star Wars Story” (2018), “The Beatles: Eight Days a Week — The Touring Years” (2016), “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” (2000) and “The DaVinci Code” (2006) — among others. He also produced films including “tick, tick…BOOM!” (2021) and the Emmy-winning series “Arrested Development” (2003-2019). 
Frank Price is an influential former producer and studio executive, widely credited as having helped develop the “made-for-TV” movie and miniseries television formats. Price was also credited in films including “Gandhi” (1982), “Ghostbusters” (1984) and “Back to the Future” (1985). He has also served as head of Universal TV. In 1987, he founded his own studio, Price Entertainment, which later merged with Columbia Pictures in 1991. Price is the founding chair of the USC School of Cinematic Arts’ Board of Councilors and has served on the USC Board of Trustees for more than 25 years.
Bina Venkataraman is a journalist, author and policy expert who has written for the New York Times and the Boston Globe, where she now serves as editor-at-large. Under the Obama administration, she served as senior advisor for climate change and advised the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology during the Ebola epidemic. NPR named her 2019 bestselling book, “The Optimist’s Telescope: Thinking Ahead in a Reckless Age,” as a best book of the year. Venkataraman spoke at USC’s 2021 commencement ceremony.

USC Student Health will make a second booster dose for the coronavirus vaccine available for members of the community who are eligible, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said at a student media briefing Tuesday. This comes after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation for people who are 65 and older and those over 50 with underlying health conditions to receive the additional dose. Student Health will not require the shot as of now, but it will likely be made available for students in the near future, Van Orman said. 
“It’s about making it available, making sure everyone in our community is aware that, if they fall into those categories, that they can and should access the vaccine,” Van Orman said. 
Current booster shot rates for students still remain around 85%. Van Orman said Student Health hopes to see this number reach close to 100% and continues to urge eligible students to get boosted. 
The University has received results from nearly 18,000 post-spring break coronavirus tests, with 90 students self-reporting after antigen testing or testing outside of USC. About 140 individuals tested positive, yielding a student positivity rate of 0.7%, up slightly from last week’s rate of 0.5%
“Cases are actually remaining very low in L.A. County and in the rest of the U.S.,” Van Orman said. “So that number is again what we anticipated and reflects the students who may have picked it up during travel.“
The University continues to offer tests this week and has already received results from around 10,000 additional tests. Student Health is encouraging anyone with symptoms to stay home and get tested right away. 
The University has seen an increase in BA.2 variant cases, according to Van Orman. Currently, around 25% of the positive tests received are of the BA.2 variant, compared to around 5% in January. Van Orman said this data is similar to that of the rest of the country. However, the majority of cases within the USC community are still BA.1 along with a few cases of the Delta variant. 
“We’re concerned just like everyone else, because the BA.2 is, we believe, more transmissible, but the strategies remain the same as we would handle BA.1,” Van Orman said.
The vaccine appears to have the same amount of protection against severe disease and hospitalization for BA.1, the first detected omicron variant, and BA.2. symptoms of the variants are also similar. Van Orman said there is currently very little re-infection within the University community, particularly because most students are vaccinated or had coronavirus in December or January. 
If outbreaks did occur within the community, Student Health would increase surveillance testing again for fully vaccinated students.
“We’re not seeing rising cases in the county, we’re not seeing a rise in hospitalizations and we’re not seeing a rise in deaths,” Van Orman said. “Right now, within the county, things look very stable.”

Undergraduate Student Government senator and vice president-elect Nivea Krishnan presented a resolution to establish a framework by which USC administration would recognize petitions at the senate meeting Tuesday. If approved, USG would recognize student petitions that meet the criteria as formal resolutions and present them to University administration.
The resolution recognized various student petitions successful in the past, such as implementing and extending Pass/No Pass class options since Fall 2020. It also mentioned various student petitions overlooked by the University, such as the petition demanding justice for Kayla Love, who spoke out about an “unethical” wellness check conducted against her by Department of Public Safety officers in June 2021. To create the infrastructure to implement this resolution, a new bylaw was introduced for the 2022-23 school year. 
Another bylaw amendment shifts funds away from the USG Operation Department within the Communications Office, which currently remains inoperative, and allocated it to other purposes, such as stipends for elections commissioners, who are currently not reimbursed for their labor. The amendment would also reduce the number of commissioners to four from at least five.
“It’s something [Woodworth] and I actually campaigned on,” said Krishnan in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I’m glad that we’re taking those steps to make those changes so that we’re [giving stipends to] the Elections Commission because they deserve it. I don’t know why they did any unpaid work, honestly. Stipends are a big thing. It’s what motivates people to work.”
An additional bylaw amendment included modifications to the USG election structure, such as the implementation of ranked choice voting. This change comes after the recent elections caused controversy by only including one ticket on the ballot and excluding write-in candidates.
Senator Hunter Hinson also presented a funding proposal to create the USC History Fund, which would allocate $10,000 to the University’s history department to “study USC histories that have been forgotten, overlooked, subordinated, or suppressed,” such as the mistreatment of Japanese American students during World War II. The fund would support student research proposals for a one-year trial period, after which Hinson said he hopes the University will help fund it so that it may continue in the future.
Given that the proposal’s creation was driven by the fact that parts of USC history have been hidden, Hinson said he is not certain about how enthusiastic University administration would be to help sustain the project. However, Hinson said he hopes the trial period, and the fact that other prestigious universities, such as Princeton, have similar programs, will work to encourage the University’s recognition of the fund’s importance.
“I’m hopeful, but also, I want to be realistic and say that it’s kind of a toss-up to see in the future, but we’re definitely gonna work on the sustainability of the program in the future,” Hinson said.
Senators unanimously approved the resolution in Support of Faculty Calls for Higher Salaries. The resolution supports members of the University chapter of the American Association of University Professors who wrote an open letter calling for higher salaries that reflect the rise in cost of living in Los Angeles during the past years. 
President-elect Hannah Woodworth presented the 2022-23 cabinet. If approved, the cabinet wouvld include chief of staff Diego Andrades, chief diversity officer Zaid Diaz-Arias, chief programming officer Rianna Rios, chief financial officer Brian Stowe and chief communications officer Paul Yi.
Woodworth and Krishnan selected the roster with the help of current cabinet members. Applications and interviews were reviewed based on a grading scale through which Woodworth and Krishnan ranked applicants. Students who applied for multiple positions were asked questions regarding each position and ranked accordingly. 
“Hannah and I are really happy with the way the cabinet turned out and we think everyone is really qualified,” Krishnan said.
The senate will approve the cabinet at next week’s meeting.

In research, it can be difficult to conduct a longitudinal study, one that repeatedly gathers data from participants over a prolonged period of time. Their continuous participation can’t be guaranteed, and a great deal of funding is needed to manage collecting data at a large scale. Still, when Yun-Ju (Claire) Chen began work on her dissertation, she joined a six-year study of infants to analyze the distinction between the sensory patterns of children with autism spectrum disorder and children with other or no diagnosis. The group’s findings present a potential new form of ASD screening, allowing for early intervention and support of children with ASD.
Chen joined the study in its third year of data collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, as a doctoral student under the guidance of USC Chan Division Associate Dean Grace Baranek and Director of Instrument Development and Psychometric/Statistical Analysis John Sideris. The study analyzed the correlation between the developmental trajectories of sensory patterns in infants and later ASD diagnosis. The study, co-written by Baranek and Sideris, was published March 2 as an empirical article in scientific journal “Child Development.”
When Baranek moved from UNC to USC to serve as associate dean and chair of the Chan Division, Chen made the decision to follow and continue her dissertation work in Los Angeles. 
Having worked with Sideris for close to a decade in North Carolina, Baranek hired him shortly after she assumed her new role at USC to fulfill the need for another methodologist on the team. Baranek also brought the Program for Early Autism Research, Leadership and Service — a group that continues as a collaboration between UNC and USC — and created the insp!re lab.
The study followed a cohort of 1,517 infants born in 2013 to further examine the sensory patterns of developing children identified by other researchers. The researchers first identified the infants’ risk of a later ASD diagnosis, then tracked their sensory patterns at three time-points: infancy, pre-school years and school years through parent reporting. 
In her dissertation, Chen described the three major sensory patterns analyzed in this study: hyperresponsiveness, “an exaggerated or avoidant response to sensory stimuli;” hyporesponsiveness, “a lack of or delayed response to sensory stimuli” and sensory interests, repetitions and seeking behaviors, “a fascination with or craving of sensory stimulation that is intense and may be repetitive in nature.” 
The study found that the sensory patterns of children with ASD were characterized by higher hyperresponsiveness and hyporesponsiveness at infancy that increased as the children grew older, which contrasts the sensory patterns of children not diagnosed with ASD, which began with lower sensory trait scores that decreased or remained stable over time.
This difference in developmental trajectory suggests that the measuring of sensory patterns in infants could be used to detect ASD early on and provide children the support necessary from a young age.
In addition to the clinical outcome, the study recorded three demographic variables to determine if variability of sensory trajectory could be further accounted for by a child’s sex, race or their parents’ education levels. 
The greatest variability of sensory pattern trajectory between groups was by their parents’ education level. Children of parents with higher education levels tended to have more stable or improving trajectories for hyporesponsiveness and hyperresponsiveness than children of parents with lower education levels. As parents with higher education levels may be more enabled to intervene early and utilize different resources, the finding could be an indication of the effect of caregivers on children’s development and highlight the importance of parent responsiveness.
Sideris said that what he found exciting about the study was its innovative use of latent growth analysis. While there was existing literature on this aspect of child development, Baranek said that it relied on cross-sectional analysis of different children of various ages, while this study followed a cohort of infants and recorded data from the same children at different ages.
“You can’t compare one child at one year to a different child at two years,” Baranek said. “It’s apples to oranges.”
Baranek explained that the variability between individuals with the same demographics and their clinical outcome highlighted the importance of tracking long-term trajectory, rather than comparing the averages of different age groups in a cross sectional study.
“There’s so much variation within the group of autism that it actually overlaps with the variation we see in normal development,” Baranek said. “You can’t just isolate one trajectory and say, ‘That’s the definitive marker of autism.’”
To expedite implementation of the study’s findings, Baranek said the group involved the “people who [they’re] trying to impact with the work” from the beginning, including parents and clinicians. While more research is needed about the effect of intervention treatment, Baranek said the study immediately supports clinicians because “sometimes they need studies to back up why what they’re doing is important and that what they’re doing is a real phenomenon.”
Chen postulates that given more time and research to validate its findings, researchers may use the study to revise current autism diagnostic standards.
“Social communication deficits are probably still kind of the mass standard for ASD diagnosis,” Chen said, but this study shows that sensory behavior “could be another behavioral domain that needs to be paid attention to during early childhood.”
“The general consensus is that early intervention is usually associated with better outcomes. The earlier you introduce the intervention to the child, they’ll have more opportunities to acquire the skills they need,” Chen said on the importance of early intervention for children at a high risk of ASD. “We could identify their needs early on and provide timely and/or targeted interventions to them.”
Since the parent questionnaire used to evaluate the risk of later ASD diagnosis in infants, the First Year Inventory, had not yet been translated and validated in Spanish, Hispanic and Latinx families were not included in the study. The Innovations in Neurodevelopmental Sensory Processing Research lab team has since worked on translating the FYI to be “culturally and linguistically appropriate” for Spanish-speaking families. The researchers at insp!re lab are now collecting norms from families to calibrate the scores and cut-offs of the screener so that it can be used in a follow-up study focusing on Spanish-speaking families in L.A.
“We’re able to contact families and have them fill out the FYI on their infant, and we’ll be able to now do that in Spanish and English,” Baranek said.

“I’m about to disrupt a football match, and I’m terrified.” 
Those were the words of 21-year-old Louis McKechnie minutes before he hopped the fence at St. James’ Park and zip tied his own neck to a soccer goal post during a matchup between Everton and Newcastle United March 17. 
Wearing a bright orange shirt and wired aviator-style glasses, McKechnie managed to secure his neck to the goal post before the security guards caught him. An angry fan handed one of the guards a knife, which was a little strange considering knives are likely not allowed at the stadium, but McKechnie wouldn’t budge even after his neck was freed. Going limp, the security guards had to drag the young engineering student off of the pitch. 
Although McKechnie was only on the field for a few minutes, his impact was made. Pictures of the protestor went viral on social media, prominently featuring McKechnie’s shirt, which read: “Just Stop Oil,” and both above and below a link to the organization’s Facebook website. 
Like everything that goes viral, responses to McKechnie’s protest varied. Plenty of soccer fans expressed their disapproval of the method by which the climate activist decided to spread his message. U.K. radio station TalkRadio had McKechnie on their station after the event, and did not pull any punches. 
“I’ve gotta be honest with you, I’d have just left you there and let the players take shots at you,” TalkRadio host Julia Hartley-Brewer said. 
“Our government wants more oil and gas,” McKechnie said in response to Hartley-Brewer’s question about his motives for his demonstration. “Oil is killing people now, fueling war and destroying our future.” 
Whether you agree with his methods of protest or not, McKechnie is right. Fossil fuels are causing a world of problems for our planet. 
Our consumption of fossil fuels, which are used for 80% of America’s energy needs, is becoming increasingly problematic. Obtaining oil from the earth and processing it damages the surrounding land, which hurts surrounding wildlife and communities of people. 
Burning fossil fuels releases chemicals that, when inhaled, can cause cancer and other deadly diseases. Additionally, burning fossil fuels contributes to the ongoing climate crisis, one that has already devastated communities around the world and will only continue to put people in danger. 
A move to cleaner, renewable energy is essential to reverse the damages to the environment and climate that have already been caused by fossil fuel consumption. 
JSO, a U.K.-based organization, believes in nonviolent civil resistance as the best way to spread their message of concern for the climate. According to their website, JSO has sent representatives to other English Premier League matches to pull off similar stunts as McKechnie. 
JSO demands that the British government “halt all future licensing and consents for the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels in the UK,” according to their website. The campaign is completely funded by donations.
Sports has a long history of being used as a mechanism for political expression. The spectacle of a soccer match or basketball demands attention, and that stage can be taken advantage of. McKechnie and the JSO knew they would capture an entire stadium, not to mention the millions of followers of ESPN and other sports media outlets that posted about the protest. 
Interrupting sporting events is a slippery slope. It can be dangerous for both the protestor and the players if anything goes awry. However, McKechnie putting his neck on the line for climate justice still remains admirable. We should continue to use sports as an outlet to discuss serious issues, issues that are truly bigger than any sport, stadium or athlete.

USC baseball is preparing for its upcoming game against Seattle University after dropping its previous series to conference foe Oregon. The Trojans currently sit at 14-8 on the season and will play a stand-alone game against the Redhawks on Wednesday.
The team is recovering after their away series against the Ducks. The Trojans lost on Friday 9-7, won Saturday’s game 6-5 and finally suffered a heartbreaking loss Sunday’s game 7-6. 
USC was up 6-1 until the seventh inning Sunday with key offensive contributions from sophomore catcher Garett Guillemette, redshirt senior outfielder Trevor Halsema and junior first baseman Nick Lopez. Batting in the fifth spot in the lineup, Guillemette hit a single RBI that brought in D’Andre Smith. Halsema’s single in the first inning brought in Guillemette and Tyresse Turner. In the same inning, Lopez hit a two-run homer to right field.
The Ducks sparked a rally in the seventh inning after outfielder Colby Shade hit a 2-run home run. Following Shade was a 3-run homer from catcher Josiah Cromwick in the eighth inning to tie the game, and finally outfielder Tanner Smith hit one out of the park for the go-ahead run. 
Head Coach Jason Gill said he recognizes that USC can’t afford to throw away innings.
“On Sunday, we basically lost two of nine innings, and unfortunately in our sport, sometimes when you do that, you lose the game,” Gill said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I think walking away from there, as hard as it was to feel like we were a good team and we got better, we certainly did.”
Gill said the team agrees this loss is not reflective of their progress thus far in the season. 
“Our season isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon. We still have well over half of our conference games left, so I feel like we got better in a lot of areas,” Gill said.
On the season, redshirt sophomore outfielder Adrian Colon-Rosado leads the board with a .360 batting average and 27 hits. Close behind are redshirt sophomore infielder/outfielder Tyresse Turner and redshirt sophomore outfielder Rhylan Thomas, averaging .346 and .330, respectively. Turner has 28 hits and Thomas has 30 hits. 
Colon-Rosado, Turner and Thomas have all significantly contributed offensively for the Trojans this season so far, but Gill saids there is no single player that leads this team.
“One of our strengths is that we play together as a team, and we have a different hero pretty much every day,” Gill said. “We’re going to do our best to continue to throw strikes at a high level and compete in the strike zone. Offensively, when we play together and we don’t take individual at-bats — we take team at-bats, I think that’s our strength.”
Gill’s Trojans remain optimistic as they look forward to their match against the Redhawks. The first pitch is set for Wednesday at 6 p.m.

Content warning: This article contains references to war, death and violence.
As I sat with my 30-pound suitcase wedged between my ribs and lap in a ride-gone-wrong back from the airport, I fretted about the minuscule chance its inertia would slaughter us all in a car crash. I scrolled to the bottom of my Uber app to start typing driver feedback, but above the “HELP” button, a flag — blue then yellow stripes — averted my gaze. 
While my privilege allowed me to squat in Parisian cafés and try authentic Dim Sum for the first time over spring break, Russia continued to terrorize Ukraine. As Ukrainians fled their homes, I left a Southwest terminal and encountered Uber’s donation page for Ukrainian relief, a recent partnership with the International Rescue Committee.  
First and foremost, my heart goes out to the people and their families impacted by Russia’s war on Ukraine. We must condemn Putin’s senseless imposition of violence upon the innocent people of Ukraine. 
With that being said, the outpouring of support for Ukraine has also raised issues. News reporters, such as ITV News Correspondent Lucy Watson, summarized the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine in an all-too-racist and disturbing way: “The unthinkable has happened … this is not a developing, third-world nation; this is Europe!” 
These “third-world” nations experiencing humanitarian crises, such as Palestine and Yemen, warrant the same support as Ukraine. Unfortunately, as evidenced by the world’s disproportionate attitudes toward violence against Europeans and white people, equitable support, sadly, is not a reality.
Ukraine’s Deputy Chief Prosecutor David Sakvarelidze even expressed this attitude by stating, “It’s very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed.” These racist attitudes toward violence against Middle Eastern and African countries make this request for equitable support seem impossible.  
The double standard of crises that “deserve our attention” manifested at the University of Chicago, which offered scholarships to students impacted by the Russian war on Ukraine. 
In another — dare I say, strange — example, President Carol Folt conflated the Ukrainian crisis with a post about International Women’s Day wrting, “On this International Women’s Day, the women of Ukraine are in my heart. Many have had to leave their homes, their loved ones, literally carrying their children on their backs to find safety. Others are joining in the fight to defend their families and their homeland desperate for peace and freedom.”  
Folt has never voiced this kind of support for Syrian or Palestinian women before, so this gesture, despite its good intentions, comes off as yet another Eurocentric perspective that pits the lives of white people above the lives of others. Of course, the women of Ukraine are in my heart — but where is this same energy for Palestinians defending their homeland?  
These superficial institutional cries of support overshadow Ukraine’s refugee crisis and the reality of its military. When we donate to Ukraine’s military, we think of helping innocent Ukrainian citizens. We don’t think of Ukraine’s military ties with a volunteer group called the Azov battalion, which contains members with close ties to neo-Nazi groups. We don’t think of Ukrainian border guards blocking Africans and other immigrants from crossing into Poland.  
We should, however, denounce imperial nations’ colonial patterns and NATO’s role as a “war machine of imperialism.” It is not mutually exclusive to denounce Russia’s actions and call attention to military intervention’s historical harm, undermined by its supposed protection. For instance, Viet Thanh Nguyen, author of Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “The Sympathizer” and professor at USC, shared his thoughts regarding the conflict on his Instagram account. 
“I fled from Viet Nam as a refugee in 1975 and came to the United States. While I’m grateful for American aid, I wouldn’t have needed American aid if the United States hadn’t invaded Viet Nam in the first place,” Nguyen wrote. “As a refugee, I am aware that wars kill more civilians than soldiers, and that wars always produce refugees.” 
Not to mention the fact that, according to a The Economist poll, 42% of Americans still believe that Russia is a communist state, which speaks to our knowledge gap still prompted by the Red Scare. Although that fact doesn’t invalidate Russia’s invasion or Ukrainians’ suffering by any means, millions of Americans’ collective attitude toward violent intervention still follows the “Communism is bad, so we must protect democracy” rhetoric. We must question the nationalist narratives we spread among each other and what these narratives imply about the value of non-Western and non-European countries. 
Particularly and ironically, we falsely label Russia as an authoritarian communist state, yet NATO sanctions Russian oil. As a result, the U.S. must look to Saudi Arabia to replace its oil import. Saudi Arabian military intervention in Yemen, however, has killed more than 370,000 civilians and put millions at risk of famine. Yemen has not received the attention we bestow to Ukraine, which further pushes the narrative of Middle Eastern countries as inferior.  
War will tear us apart, and those of us fortunate enough to have never witnessed such violence must maintain compassion for all innocent civilians in all countries, including the marginalized communities at home who suffer trauma from living in environments with elevated violence. Our hearts must go out to all of them, not just Ukraine.
Please consider donating to these organizations that provide humanitarian aid to civilians in Ukraine, Palestine and Yemen, respectively:

The first time I had a French baguette, my imagination ran wild and was instantly transported to Paris. I was no longer sitting at a table inside a coffee shop in Los Angeles but instead gazing at the Mona Lisa at the Louvre, window shopping at Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior and walking in Jardins du Trocadéro next to the Eiffel Tower. Afterward, I rode the subway through the Paris Arrondissements from St. Germain to Marais and soaked in the Parisian culture by eating bouillabaisse, coq au vin, Paris-Brest and drinking a glass of delicious champagne.  
In an attempt to replicate this magical feeling, I went to Camphor. Walking into the contemporary French bistro’s modern, open, white interior with natural accents elicits a sense of freedom and plays like an artist’s blank canvas. The restaurant is a welcomed addition to the food scene in L.A.’s Arts District. Led by co-executive chefs Max Boonthanakit and Lijo George, bar stools line the open kitchen, known as the “chef’s counter” seating, giving diners a full view of the kitchen’s activities.
The wine program, led by Kalani Lau, is adorned predominantly by French wines and global gems from California and Italy. After selecting a beautiful White Burgundy from a small vineyard in the Cote d’Or called Santenay Clos de Malte, the chefs sent a glass of rose sparkling wine and the first bite to begin the evening. While the cuisine is French, there were South Asian influences found in the amuse-bouche, a small dome cracker topped with white bean hummus, harissa and chives, decorated by a bed of dried, colorful lentils.  
I sat in a blue velvet banquette seat, which provided a great view of the restaurant and the slowly filling dining room. The first section of the menu was titled “snacks,” and the warm sourdough bread option caught my eye. It was thickly sliced and served with a cloud of Époisses butter, a perfect mixture of French butter and the classical creamy and pungent fragrant cheese hailing from Burgundy in France.
The design of the menu was clean and clear, mirroring the elegance of the dining room. Following the snack section were a selection of starters, sides, salads, mains and desserts, all mouthwatering and easy to navigate. The beef tartare was exceptionally executed and served with herb tempuras, whose crunchy texture was an unexpected match to the finely minced and elevated beef. Barbajuan Dungeness crab was a playful pastry pillow served with a white sauce and small sweet peppadew red peppers.
The perfectly cooked lobster was drizzled tableside with a delicious curry coral jus, and a separate plate of its innards was served with a creamy sauce and garnished with chives. The glazed vegetables with truffle added to the lightness of the meal.
For dessert, the kiwi with a hint of mint made for an impressive end to the night. The presentation was a delightful feast for your senses; visually, the delectable treat was topped with a frozen green sorbet decorated as if it were a real kiwi and below were decadent textures of kiwi and lime gelee. As mignardise, two cute mini macaroons with lime ganache were served at the end of the meal. From start to finish, the meal was expertly executed from the front of the house to the back of the house.  
As a busy student balancing a full-time job, it’s not easy to travel to Paris on a Friday night, but with a little bit of imagination, it is always possible to bring Paris here. Camphor is the perfect destination for a Parisian date night out where you can experience an abundance of art, culture, food and wine, all while being in the comfort of our home in L.A.

Rick Caruso played on home turf at USC’s Bovard Auditorium for the Los Angeles mayoral debate March 22. While the Chair of the USC Board of Trustees’ ideological platform and debate might have seemed less rigorous than those of other candidates, particularly frontrunner Karen Bass, Caruso still walked away from the night as its biggest winner. 
Elex Michaelson, an anchor for FOX 11 News and one of the debate’s two moderators alongside Erika D. Smith, a columnist for the L.A. Times, began the event by introducing some of the candidates’ many ties to USC, including Michaelson’s own alumni status. Later in the night, some USC students directly asked the candidates questions. This affinity towards the University posed a stark contrast to last month’s debate, where fellow candidate Mike Feuer dubbed Caruso responsible for the evident lack of safety for women at USC. On Tuesday, comparatively, Caruso’s long stint at USC was hardly mentioned. 
The reality that attacking our beloved “University of Scandals and Corruption” was somewhat off limits last Tuesday was one that likely benefited Caruso. Even as the guy that brought in both Lincoln Riley and former Wharton School Dean Geoffrey Garrett, Caruso still faces criticism at USC, as his record isn’t exactly squeaky clean. 
A long time former Republican who officially registered as a Democrat in January, Caruso is, to many, an obvious “Democrat in Name Only.” Back in February, he missed the race’s first debate due to a “scheduling conflict.” And, ultimately, he is an old, white billionaire famous for building luxury real estate in a city defined by diversity, progressive policies and an ever-growing homelessness problem. 
Caruso was addressed repeatedly, sustaining attacks all night. Feuer challenged him on his refusal to show his tax returns. Kevin De Leon and Joe Buscaino similarly painted Caruso as a corrupt and greedy rule-breaker who is out of touch with Angelenos. Even Bass, who spent most of the night exasperatedly trying to return to the actual issues at hand, eventually sparred with Caruso, taking issue with him “denigrating” those who have “devoted their lives to public service.” 
So, while it’s debatable whether Caruso seemed at all sympathetic in what he said was “obviously a three against one,” it’s undeniable that he got the most exposure. Right now, that means more.
To borrow wordplay from Lakers fans, the debate quickly became a “Carushow.” No matter how much they tried to antagonize him, Caruso came out smelling relatively like a rose. And, even when he didn’t completely stick the landing, there was no “gotcha” moment near damning enough to outweigh the value of the publicity itself. 
From the perspective of voters, the critique of Caruso’s wealth simply isn’t as effective or compelling as his counter criticism of L.A. politicians and their abundant incompetence. Between endless opportunities to speak and equally endless funding for his advertisements, Caruso has now made up for lost time. Better yet, he’s done it all with a winning smile on his face.
Caruso’s opponents, in comparison, seemed much less charismatic throughout the night. Bass, staying above the petty back and forths, certainly seemed composed and experienced, but she did not get the attention or screen time worthy of a true frontrunner. Nor is her apparent optimism doing her any favors: saying she personally felt completely safe in L.A. was a massive miss. 
Ultimately, Caruso’s status as an outsider is the X-factor of his campaign. His opponents could have exploited it as a weakness if they properly challenged him on specifics. Instead, they attacked his character, a strategy which felt flat as they strayed away from their expertise: policymaking itself. The sniveling bombast of his opponents, besides the taciturn Bass, ended up giving Caruso all the ammunition he needed to successfully paint them as roundly inept bureaucrats. 
As a result of the personal nature of this debate, voters weren’t given much insight as to any major differences between the candidates’ policies themselves. In fact, the platforms seemed relatively similar in many ways: to make some sort of formal declaration about the homelessness crisis and then build some amount of temporary housing, and to “treat mental health issues” although no one really explained how. All candidates wanted to increase LAPD’s budget, save for De Leon who wants to keep it the same. It seemed the sole point of truly major contention was over the recall effort for District Attorney George Gascon, but even there the candidates all agreed about the nature of his wrongdoing. Their dispute was rather over the effectiveness of recalls themselves.
While it is still early, the buzz from Tuesday’s debate was huge for Caruso. He might not have yet  won over the voters nor has he dominated by the virtue of groundbreaking policy. But, ultimately, he generated all the momentum needed to consider himself the night’s biggest winner. If Caruso makes the right bet to support Gascon’s recall, I predict L.A. will end up with the closest thing to a Republican mayor since Richard Riordan.

Spring has come again, but sadly, for us Trojans, our break has already passed. You may feel down, but with the arrival of spring, a season of optimism and new beginnings, there is so much to look forward to including the blooming of the flowers and the imminent ending of the long school year. 
Even though Los Angeles seems to always be in a state of eternal spring, the season’s arrival also poses a perfect opportunity to sit back, relax and indulge in some visually delectable entertainment when you’re not out frolicking in a meadow of tulips or when the April showers shut you inside. No matter what spring means to you, here are seven films sure to get you into the spirit of the season.
“Emma.” (2020)
One of many screen adaptations of Jane Austen’s classic slow burn romance novel “Emma,” director Autumn de Wilde’s film has a posh and pastel regency aesthetic that will raise your spirits. The shots of blooming gardens, colorful costumes and dollhouse sets are like a delicate cake that you want to devour — except the film’s complex storyline gives you no choice but to pace yourself. Anya Taylor-Joy and Johnny Flynn star as pining lovers Emma Woodhouse and Mr. Knightley, two lifelong friends who gradually develop feelings for one another.
“Mary Poppins” (1964)
Set in 1910’s London, this Disney musical masterpiece imagines life as an enchanted stroll through the park. The story follows the adventures of the Banks children as they learn important life lessons from their magical nanny, Mary Poppins. It’s impossible not to feel cheerful while  watching talented Hollywood legends Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke dazzle the screen as they perform iconic numbers such as “A Spoonful of Sugar” and “Step in Time.” These are complemented by beautiful animated Technicolor visuals which add to the whimsical, joyous and timeless classic. The whimsy, joyful feeling the movie elicits will make you want to break into song and, perhaps, whip out a choreographed dance on Trousdale to celebrate spring.  
“Crazy Rich Asians” (2018)
If you want to re-experience the feeling of being on vacation, then USC alumnus Jon M. Chu’s contemporary rom-com is the pick for you. “Crazy Rich Asians” follows the whirlwind adventure of Rachel (Constance Wu), a Chinese American professor who finds herself in a world of fame, wealth and high society when she accompanies her boyfriend (Henry Golding) on a trip to Singapore for his friend’s wedding. The story is enhanced by vibrant, colorful couture, grand locations and, of course, luxury goods. Viewing this film is a getaway in itself and will have you back in the spring break mindset in no time.
“Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” (1986)
Even though midterms are over, it seems that the work only gets more intense as the semester goes on. A little advice from Ferris Bueller (Matthew Brederick): “Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once and a while, you could miss it.”
In this John Hughes classic, high school senior and teenage warrior Ferris Bueller does what every student wishes they could do: Ditch school to spend the day doing whatever he wants. The film proves that you can in fact find some relaxation on a weekday — as long as you don’t get caught. So take a lesson from Bueller and let yourself relax (even if that means skipping class). 
“Big Fish” (2003)
Tim Burton substitutes his trademark gothic aesthetic for one of cotton candy colors and fields of yellow daffodils in this whimsical spring-themed and heartwarming adventure. Edward Bloom has always told stories about his life that his son, William, believes to border on complete fiction. As Edward nears the end of his life, his son works towards uncovering the truth and wonder of his father’s great travels and tales. Through the flashback adventures of the young Edward (Ewan McGregor), Burton tells a touching story about the capacity of the human imagination and the truth that lies within it.
“Marie Antoinette” (2006)
Sofia Coppola’s visual masterpiece reimagine’s the story of Marie Antoinette and her rise to power and fame. Coppola serves her tour-de-force film on a silver platter, treating you to stunning visuals of the magnificent interiors of the Palace of Versailles, presentations of decadent French desserts and drinks and a glamorous Academy Award-winning ensemble of costumes. If you are into cottagecore escapism, you’ll get to escape to the countryside following the young queen through her custom built hamlet and the Palace of Versailles’ spectacular gardens.

Although Women’s History Month is close to an end, the celebration of women should continue past the 31 days of the month. What better way to celebrate than listening to music and recognizing the talented women that grace your favorite Spotify playlists. While it’s totally understandable to stay within the comforts of the songs you know, you may find joy in discovering a new tune to put on repeat.  
If you’re scrolling through your songs and notice that you listen to mostly male artists or want to dive deeper into hidden gems, these are the recommendations for you. Here are seven underrated songs by women for you to listen to right now. 
“First Train Home” by Imogen Heap
While you may be a stranger to this song and Imogen Heap, you have likely heard Heap’s most listened to song on Spotify, “Hide and Seek,” or at least recognize the iconic line “Mm, what’d you say?” which is used in both her song and Jason Derulo’s 2010 hit “Whatcha Say.” Heap’s unique voice and vivid lyrics are present in “First Train Home,” the first track on her third album, “Ellipse.” This song shows storytelling at its finest, and it perfectly captures the sentiment of feeling out of place and wanting to go back to somewhere you understand. 
If you’re a fan of Harry Potter, Heap also composed the music for the play “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” which is a combination of new music and her older songs reworked for the score. In fact, the opening track includes elements from “First Train Home.” 
“Drop The Pilot” by Joan Armatrading 
If you are a fan of 80s’ rock, give Joan Armatrading’s song “Drop the Pilot” a listen. Released as the third track off of her eighth studio album “The Key,” “Drop the Pilot” is a true treasure and testament to the electric feel of 80s’ music. This repeat-worthy song will have you for your crush to ditch their partner and recognize that you’re clearly the better option for them. 
Armatrading has paved the way for many in the music industry as a Black women guitarist after she got her start in rock ‘n’ roll in the 70s’. Now at 71 years old, she has released 20 studio albums and even engineered and played all of the instruments on her most recent album “Consequences.” “Drop the Pilot” is a great song to start with if you haven’t heard her music. Who knows? She may be your new favorite artist.
“I’m Dreamin’ a Dream” by Norma Tanega 
Norma Tangea’s sweet and mesmerizing song “I’m Dreamin’ a Dream” is quite different from “Walkin’ My Cat Named Dog,” the song that got her famous. This is the eighth track on her first album, “Walkin’ My Cat Named Dog.” The song that shares this album’s title was the only song that became a hit during Tangea’s life, featuring oddball lyrics and Tangea playing the harmonica. 
“I’m Dreamin’ a Dream” shows Tangea’s range and talent to write a peaceful romantic song while maintaining her distinctive take on songwriting that she displays her other songs. What better way to celebrate women than by listening to a truly unique and very special artist.
“Someday We’ll Linger in the Sun” by Gaelynn Lea 
If you like folk music, you will love Gaelynn Lea’s heartbreaking song “Someday We’ll Linger in the Sun.” Unfortunately, even though this is her number one song on Spotify, it isn’t getting nearly as much recognition as it deserves. Lea is truly a marvelous lyricist/violinist, and this song shows off her talents to the fullest extent. Out of more than 6,000 entries, Lea won NPR’s Tiny Desk Contest in 2016 for her performance of this song, which eventually became track seven on her 2018 album “Learning How to Stay.”
Outside of music, Lea advocates for disability rights for artists and the arts as a whole. For all of the theater fans out there, Lea is also currently composing the music for Broadway’s revival of “Macbeth,” which opens this year and will have a limited run of 15 weeks. Lea’s talent is finally being recognized, and you certainly don’t want to miss her making her mark on the music industry.  
“Jungle” by H.E.R.
If you are looking for a song to blast with your headphones on, look no further than H.E.R.’s song “Jungle.” This song is 5 minutes of perfection, making you feel like time is slowing down as you are completely absorbed in the sound. “Jungle” is track 12 on the 21 track album titled “H.E.R.” released in 2017. 
At 23 years old, H.E.R. had already won an Oscar for her original song “Fight For You,” which she sang and co-wrote for the 2021 film “Judas and the Black Messiah.” H.E.R.’s accomplishments continue to grow and impress, receiving 21 Grammy Nominations and 4 wins at just 24 years old. 
It’s no secret that women are powerful and talented musicians changing the music industry for the better. So add these songs to your queue or your next playlist and jam out to these underappreciated, should-have-been-hit songs as you celebrate during the final week of Women’s History Month.
