The No. 3 seeded women’s soccer team kicked off its postseason last Friday with a 2-1 victory against a familiar foe — Eastern Washington University. Last season, the Women of Troy dominated the Eagles 3-1 to kick off the 2016 NCAA tournament. 
“At least it’s a team we know, we’ve played them,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said before the match. “The hard part is they know us and they’ve played us. They have had another good year and we are going to have to be prepared to play them.”
Despite the Trojans’ preparation, the Eagles stole the early lead. In the sixth minute, the Eagles drove the ball into the USC zone and placed a shot on target. Redshirt freshman goalkeeper Kaylie Collins made the save but was unable to secure the ball. Senior forward Chloe Williams found the rebound and delivered a shot to the back of the Trojans’ net to grant the Eagles the lead. 
“When you get scored on early, it wakes you up and the urgency had to pick up,” Collins said. “It was more of everyone getting on each other at that point and asking more from each other.” 
After the score, USC played lockdown defense and generated a couple scoring opportunities but was unable to convert the equalizer. The score held at 1-0 going into the half. Even though Eastern Washington held the momentum for the majority of the first half, the Trojans outshot the Eagles 14-3. Something needed to change for the Trojans in the second half if they wanted to extend their season another day. 
“We [the coaching staff] asked them what they wanted the end of their season to look like,” McAlpine said. “We changed a few things [with our formation]. But more importantly, [the coaching staff] just challenged them to really think about what they wanted the end to look like and if they wanted today to be it.” 
McAlpine’s words must have hit home with the Women of Troy because the Trojans came out flying. In the second half, the Trojans tallied 14 shots and 10 corner kicks. An early Eagle scoring opportunity almost put a damper on the Trojans’ hope of tying the match, but Collins denied the attempt and the USC offense went to work. Senior forward Alex Anthony found the equalizer off of the pass from junior forward Hailey Hite in just five minutes. The Trojans applied pressure for the entire second half, spending most of the time in the offensive zone.
In the 73rd minute, USC nearly found the go-ahead goal thanks to a rifling shot from freshman midfielder Savannah DeMelo. The ball was just wide of the post and the score remained knotted at one.
Neither team could settle the match in regulation and the game went to overtime for the first time this season at McAlister Field. 
USC produced a few scoring opportunities in the first 10-minute period with chances from both senior forward Alex Anthony and Savannah DeMelo. Once again, neither squad could best the other and the game was forced into a second overtime.
The fourth period would be short-lived, as the Trojans found the golden goal in just 18 seconds. Deep into the offensive zone, sophomore midfielder Ashleigh Plumptre lofted a cross over Eagles goalkeeper Emily Busselman toward the far post where junior forward Erika Okuma was stationed. Okuma finished the play by pounding the ball into the open net to secure the 2-1 win for the Trojans.
“We found a way to win on a day where it wasn’t our best performance and far from it,” McAlpine said. “But this team has some resolve, and it showed today. Kaylie [Collins] kept us in it in the first half and then between Alex [Anthony] and Erika [Okuma] we found a way to win it in the end.”
With the victory, the Trojans advance to the second round of NCAA Tournament where they will travel to College Station, Tex. to take on the Baylor Bears Friday at 1:30 p.m.

Eric He | Daily Trojan
If you bet on Clay Helton using the phrase “control our own destiny” after USC’s win over Colorado on Saturday, you were wrong.
Maybe it’s because the Trojans have achieved their destiny, in Helton’s eyes.
Ever since Pac-12 Media Days, Helton has stressed playing for a Pac-12 Championship as the goal for this season. Never mind that USC came into the season ranked fourth as a national championship contender, or that redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold entered the campaign as the Heisman favorite. The Pac-12 Championship was the goal stated by Helton and by Athletic Director Lynn Swann.
So now they’re here. By beating Colorado in front of 49,337 fans in frigid temperatures in Boulder, the Trojans clinched the Pac-12 South, punching their ticket to Santa Clara on Dec. 1. 
By all accounts, USC played well. Darnold was incredible, throwing for 329 yards on 21-of-34 passing and two touchdowns and scampering for another. The wide receivers were stellar, from the veteran junior Deontay Burnett hauling in six catches to freshman Tyler Vaughns amassing 90 yards. Redshirt senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. was a consistent target, and sophomore wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. recorded his first career touchdown.
On the other side of the ball, the defense pitched a shutout for the first half and redshirt junior cornerback Ajene Harris came up huge with two interceptions, including one late that helped end hopes of a late Colorado comeback. 
“I think each year you try to improve,” Helton said after the game. “We weren’t in this position last year, and now we are.” 
This statement, while true, comes with a lot of caveats. Sure, USC will likely beat UCLA next week and finish the regular season with two losses, one fewer than last season. And sure, USC may very well win the Pac-12 Championship, a game it wasn’t even invited to last year. The Trojans could also end up in the Fiesta Bowl, a bowl game that may not be as pompous as the Rose Bowl, but would be just as quality a bowl win as they achieved last season. 
And honestly, even if all of this comes to fruition, the season would still seem underwhelming.
Regardless of what Helton’s objectives were, let’s be clear here: USC was expected to compete for a national championship this season. Considering the history of the program, the success we saw last season and the preseason hype surrounding Darnold as the best quarterback in college football, we would expect nothing less. 
So when USC lost to Washington State, when USC was drubbed by Notre Dame, they were more than just losses. The difference between good and great teams, the difference between being Pac-12 champions and national champions, is that national champions find a way to pull out a win on short rest, and they find a way to not get embarrassed on primetime in South Bend.
USC has not passed the test or lived up to the hype as a national championship contender, assuming its slim chance of sneaking into the College Football Playoff doesn’t occur. This is the conundrum of the Trojans’ season, the reason why a good win over Colorado — which clinched the Pac-12 South and gave USC a chance to win the first conference title since 2008 — doesn’t feel like a big victory. 
Perhaps we’ve become numb to success at USC, which is strange considering the Trojans haven’t truly contended for national championship since more than a decade ago, and haven’t even won a conference title in almost a decade. Regardless, there lies an expectation — realistic or not — that casts a shadow over every season where those expectations are not met, and this season is no exception.
Well after the sun had set on Folsom Stadium on Saturday night and the temperature had dropped below 50 degrees, Ronald Jones II stepped outside the USC locker room in a T-shirt and shorts, draped in Beats headphones and carrying a sign that read “RoJo got da Mojo.” 
He was in a good mood, and understably so, just having run for 146 yards and passed both Mike Garrett and Reggie Bush on USC’s all-time rushing list. 
But even as he gushed about the accomplishment, he was asked about what he thought of the Trojans’ slim chances of making the playoff.
“I think it’s looking pretty good,” Jones said. “I feel like we’re just getting back in there.” 
He said the team was looking at the scores from the day, and he saw that No. 1 Georgia had lost earlier on Saturday to Auburn. But 10th-ranked Auburn winning didn’t help USC. Neither did No. 7 Miami routing No. 3 Notre Dame, or No. 8 Wisconsin beating Iowa.
Regardless of the results, there was no amount of help on Saturday that could have increased USC’s hopes of sneaking into the playoff. Those hopes died in South Bend. And while clinching a Pac-12 South title on Saturday was cool, it really didn’t change much.

In an interdisciplinary event that merged dance, spoken word and foreign policy, Dance Diplomacy with Battery Dance NYC delivered captivating performances and a riveting discussion on the role of art in public diplomacy, specifically with regard to the Middle East and Islamophobia in America. The event took place in the Wallis Annenberg Auditorium last Friday and featured dancer Hussein Smko, journalist Riyadh Mohammed, Battery Dance founder and artistic director Jonathan Hollander and Annenberg professor of public diplomacy Nick Cull. 
Hollander and Cull, who is also the director of Annenberg’s Master of Public Diplomacy Program, gave opening remarks and explained their shared goal of bringing people and culture into the foreign policy process. Since founding Battery Dance in Lower Manhattan 41 years ago, Hollander has promoted the company’s double mission of artistic excellence and social relevance. In 2006, he launched Dancing to Connect, a program that uses dance to build international relationships and is on track to send dance teachers to a total of 60 countries by the end of 2017. 
Hollander’s focus on Islamophobia and the Muslim experience began in 2012 when the program expanded to Iraq, and a longtime Baghdad-based student who took lessons over Skype was killed in a bombing. From this student, a network of dancers in the Middle East began to expand.
“Each one of our stories has to do with meeting people who then introduce us to other people,” Hollander said. “The whole process is organic; none of it is strategic. It’s why we have the ambition and passion to keep pursuing this wonderful dream.”
Following Hollander’s introduction, Smko performed a piece he had choreographed titled “Echoes of Erbil,” a tribute to his home city of Erbil, Iraq. He opened by singing a Kurdish song about the motherland and loss before launching into a deeply personal routine that expressed his often polarizing experiences of living in both Erbil and New York City. Treating his own hands as foreign objects, Smko engaged in a physical banter that represented his own internal dialogue as a Muslim immigrant. 
“The thought behind the choreography is about life in Erbil and the person I was there versus the person I am here,” Smko said. “With my hands and gestures, it’s like talking to yourself, in a sense.” 
Mohammed took the stage next and shared three spoken word memoirs about growing up in a war-torn Iraq, from how he nurtured his love for film to how his high school was shut down amid the contentious political climate. He also spoke on his personal struggles in moving to America and coming to terms with the discriminatory implications of his foreign-sounding name. 
Smko then returned for a second performance that conveyed what a person goes through during wartime — Smko himself said h has been through five wars — and how one copes with trauma. The piece was rife with aggressive movements that imparted a sense of urgency and angst. 
“There are all these ways in which a dance company can activate a relationship and communication with different audiences,” Hollander said in the subsequent panel discussion. “Being so involved in Arab countries, we feel very comfortable with the Muslim world. But we don’t think about [our differences]. For us, the communication is very fluent through dance.”
Finally, Cull led a panel discussion with Hollander about the nature of the global political environment and his personal involvement in fighting discrimnation against Muslims. 
“I felt the need to speak out against certain values,” Hollander said. “As someone who travels the world as an ambassador of America … I think my role is more in the country, to speak to Americans about the truth that I know about human beings.”

Taylor Swift’s reputation may precede her, but the songstress’ musical aptitude has never been more evident. Reputation, Swift’s sixth LP, may be her biggest release yet; with over 700,000 first-day sales, it is on track to sell well over 1 million units in one week, breaking her own record and making Swift the only artist to sell a million copies each of four different albums. In addition, reputation is Swift’s most explicit work yet — it’s an album that successfully tells an introspective story, one about letting life run its course in the aftermath of a reputational crisis.
Reputation follows a linear progression in its storytelling. From “…Ready For It?” to “Don’t Blame Me,” the first four tracks deal with a more bombastic, outspoken Swift following the public criticism she endured over the past few years. “End Game,” the only collaboration on the LP, includes polished verses from Future and Ed Sheeran — a languid hybrid of pop and R&B that takes Swift in a new direction as she makes the chants about having a “big reputation.”
“I Did Something Bad” may be her most rebellious record yet — and my personal favorite — as she takes multiple jabs against her enemies and exes, with deep cuts like “If a man talks sh-t, then I owe him nothing” and “This is how the world works / You gotta leave before you get left.” Swift is more unapologetic and spiteful than ever on this record, serving up her best slice of revenge through masterful, punchy songwriting.
“Delicate,” as Swift noted in an interview with iHeartRadio, is the first moment of vulnerability in the album. This thread continues throughout the rest of the record, representing what happens when Swift starts letting go of her reputation and starts living life on her own terms, leading up to closing ballads “Call It What You Want” and “New Year’s Day.” Much of the second half of the album is about exploring adult romance, as well as the personal effects of being in the public eye.
“Getaway Car” and “New Year’s Day” are two highlights from the second half of the album, which swerves into much more intimate territory. “Dress,” however, is arguably Swift’s sexiest song to date, hitting a jarring climax with the lyrics, “Only bought this dress so you could take it off.”

I admit — prior to its release, I was secretly skeptical of what reputation would be like. Judging from her singles “Look What You Made Me Do” and “… Ready For It?” (which were both great, don’t get me wrong), I was afraid that the album would be all punch but no knockout. But as a Swiftie of 11 years, I knew I had to be more hopeful — after all, everyone who attended the Reputation Secret Sessions said this would be Swift’s sharpest, most mature record yet. 
And it is. After listening to the album on repeat the entire weekend, I can still stand by my belief that Taylor Swift is undoubtedly one of the best songwriters and artists of our generation. There’s not a single person who can do what Swift does: pen some of the most revealing lyrics about her own life but still make it relatable to her listeners. Swift has a style and flair that separates her from other artists — her penchant for narrative storytelling, catchy hooks and melodrama are still the same, yet she somehow never makes the same album twice. 
Even though reputation and 1989 are both classified as pop albums, Swift took them in completely different directions. Reputation is a further deviation of pop, as Swift successfully explores harsher sounds, but still retains her songwriting prowess. If there’s anything Swift has proven thus far, it’s that she’s much wiser — and doing better than she ever was. With reputation, Swift wasn’t afraid to take risks: diving deep into R&B and electronic sounds with close collaborators Max Martin and Shellback in the first half, and going into softer, ’80s synth-pop influences with Jack Antonoff in the second half. And it works here, as Swift is as honest as ever in her songwriting.
Yes, Taylor Swift played me like a violin. But I have no regrets about buying four copies of her album, including the two special edition magazines at Target. She’s an artist who’s mastered her craft, and she’s the only one in the current music industry who can shatter both her own records and people’s expectations of who she is or should be. And yes, Swift does have a “big reputation,” but it’s really nobody else’s business but her own. And despite intense speculation over her songwriting subjects, Swift is making it a point that this time, her music will be the sole focus of the conversation: “There will be no further explanation. There will just be reputation.”
Taylor Swift’s out in the spotlight again. This time, she’s reclaiming her own narrative in the most grandiose fashion possible. Make your statement, Taylor.
Allen Pham is a junior majoring in public relations. He is also the associate managing editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “The A Game,” runs every other Monday. 
She has mastered her craft, yes. Her craft of regurgitating music and remaining hot and relevant in the industry. She claims that “the old Taylor” is dead, yet has done nothing significantly different from her past eras. Her music is still very standard pop and very Taylor Swift. While I appreciate her dive into a few new areas, this record is by no means groundbreaking or experimental or even daring.
She has also not shattered expectations of who she is–only said that she has, herself. And no, it’s not her music that’s the sole focus of the conversation. It’s the bling that surrounds Taylor Swift that has people going crazy right now. Case in point: LWYMMD’s rapid decline on the charts. It wasn’t the music but the bling and that’s why it didn’t have longevity.

Four master’s students from the Marshall School of Business brought home $10,000 as part of USC’s second consecutive victory at a weeklong case competition co-sponsored by Deloitte Consulting in October. 
The Deloitte National MBA Human Capital Case Competition is open to teams from the nation’s top MBA university programs, and the USC team received the top prize of $10,000. 
Brian Han, Stephanie Tandean, Sonali Vasa and George Wu are all graduate students pursuing master’s degrees in business administration who represented USC this year. They competed against teams from 11 other business schools in a case challenge that required them to utilize human resources techniques to tackle company scenarios on hiring, staffing and performance challenges. 
“We pretty much worked around 10 to 12 hours each day by setting end-day goals to accomplish so that we were always on track,” Wu said in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
The case was focused on the corporate growth of BrightStar Care, a national company that provides home care for the elderly, and challenged the teams to pitch solutions in a resourceful and timely manner.
The USC team approached the case with a strategy to create a visual narrative on its business recommendation, which will hypothetically be presented to the client interested in BrightStar Care.
“People tend to visualize a response, so painting that picture from the perspective of the CEO or the employees was [our team’s] main priority when coming up with a recommendation,” Wu said. 
According to Tandean, what distinguished the USC team from others was the members’ ability to convey a story, one that allowed the case judges to easily follow. 
“Delivery matters,” Tandean said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “A story also worked really well because it appeals to emotions. Other groups lacked this emotional appeal because they were only facts-spitting [sic] during their presentation.” 
The biggest challenges the team faced were time pressure and unexpected twists of the presented case.
“The biggest challenge was the fact that we had to make the whole presentation not just fact-based but rather flow really well as a story,” Tandean said. “It is important because with all the time we put into researching the case, we definitely found and came up with a lot of facts that can be presented.” 
Wu also formerly competed in last year’s Deloitte case competition and took part in this year’s participant selection, helping build chemistry among team members.
“It is during those twists where most teams would start arguing and falling apart,” Wu said on his case experience. 
Yet, since students were allowed to be an integral part of the participant selection process, the team’s relationship helped them mount those challenges.
“Gaining input and having someone play devil’s advocate is crucial because you need to understand all the angles before you create your story, otherwise you will have holes and the image you were trying to create will definitely fall apart,” Wu said. 
The team attributed its success to the Marshall Business Competition Program, which devotes resources and training opportunities for business students to encourage participation in national case competitions.
Introduced in 2012, the program was intended to implement case competitions into master’s students’ academic experiences.
“By creating this program we’re saying that as a school we recognize the strong value add of case competition preparation and experience,” said Tonisha Jester, associate director of USC MBA student programs. “It’s not enough to be competent — you have to show mastery.”
Students partake in a series of eight intensive workshops, meticulously parsing through the elements of a case competition through coaching by faculty, senior students and even alumni members, according to the Marshall Business Competition Program website.
“By connecting our competition teams to alumni, professors and functional and industry experts in the student clubs, we create a culture of collaboration and shared success,” said the program’s head coach Michael Kohl. “These early results prove that by fully leveraging the power of the Trojan Family, our case competition teams can deliver superior results.”
Marshall students have completed seven events as of Nov. 1, and the Deloitte competition was the most recent. 
Although the team was required to go through rigorous training and put under constant pressure, the members said they were proud of what they have learned from participating in case competitions like this one. 
“The biggest takeaway [from the competition] is understanding your team and … [working] together to really keep the team excited and motivated while working toward our goal,” Wu said.

Professor Jeremy Goldbach hopes his toolkit will be used by schools and workplaces to create supportive, diverse environments. Photo courtesy of Jeremy Goldbach.
Jeremy Goldbach, a professor at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, has a mission to spark conversations about race, gender and class — which is why he created a “diversity toolkit” for businesses, educators and other organizations to use.
“I haven’t met anyone that wouldn’t say we have problems in the U.S.,” Goldbach said. 
The toolkit is a social activity that addresses those concerns, consisting of an icebreaker, five collaborate activities and a closing activity that promotes discourse applicable to a wide variety of environments. 
“It tends to be spaces in social work and education who are the people who are reaching out more to use the toolkit,” Goldbach said. “My hope is that places like the bank and legal offices want to appreciate diversity in deeper ways. I think a lot of people have this sense of, ‘We need more diversity.’ But, I don’t think they know what it actually means to be an environment that welcomes diversity and see diversity as a strength as opposed to seeing it as something to put on a list.”
Goldbach has been working at USC for six years and conducts research on how discrimination affects young adults. He said the creation of the toolkit was a major step in his career. 
Goldbach said he was inspired to create the kit by his observation that society struggles to have productive conversations surrounding diversity. 
“We live in a world where people are very aware of the fact that there’s a lot of systems around power, oppression and discrimination,” Goldbach said. “A lot of the time it dissolves really quickly into, ‘You have power and I’m oppressed,’ and that’s not the best way for people to make reparations for these kinds of experiences.”
Goldbach has dedicated his work to promoting diversity and creating a healthy environment for young adults to discover their identities. In light of the current political climate, such as the white nationalist protests in Charlottesville in August, Goldbach believes that policy is a big part of change. 
“The government plays an important role of ensuring the safety of the people, and not just the federal government,” Goldbach said. “We can also look at state governments, county governments, city governments — even neighborhood council. All of these different systems play a role and need to be thinking about the ways they’re ensuring safety and equity.”
He hopes that these institutions can implement ideas from the toolkit into how they craft policy and address citizens. 
While Goldbach sees the importance of the role of government in encouraging the right conversations about diversity, he also recognizes the significance of the First Amendment and free speech. 
“Just as we want a space to speak freely about issues of diversity, we want to be careful about how we limit other people’s free speech,” Goldbach said. “That said, if speech has an impact on other people’s safety, it becomes a different category. It’s not just speaking your mind; it’s actually putting other people in danger.”
Goldbach hopes to continue to work on promoting diversity and helping young adults celebrate their differences. He says his next step would be finding common ground among individuals who are oppressed in unique ways. 
Throughout his time at USC, he has seen a shared experience among the people he works with and hopes to create an environment that allows these individuals to feel comfortable and safe.

Sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton will be held out of play indefinitely from the men’s basketball team due to concerns surrounding his eligibility. The news broke just before tip-off of the team’s season opener last Friday. 
“USC is working diligently to independently investigate this matter in order to confirm that De’Anthony meets the NCAA eligibility requirements,” USC said in a statement minutes before tip-off of the game against Cal State Fullerton.
Melton’s suspension comes as an investigation into associate head coach Tony Bland. Bland is involved in a nationwide FBI investigation into bribery and corruption in college basketball recruiting. He was indicted last Tuesday by a federal grand jury for charges including bribery and wire fraud. 
Bland allegedly facilitated $9,000 in total to two families of USC basketball players or recruits, one a rising freshman and the other a rising sophomore in August, according to court documents. The two athletes have not been named. All other players on the Trojans’ roster suited up and played in the team’s 84-42 season opening victory.
Melton’s attorney, Vicki I. Podberesky, told the Los Angeles Times that “multiple investigations” found no evidence that would deem Melton ineligible.
“He hopes that USC will demonstrate the same level of loyalty and commitment to him that he has given to the school and the USC basketball program,” Podberesky said to the Times. 
Melton broke out last year in his first season as a Trojan, starting in the final 25 games of the season. The 6-foot-4, 200-pound guard averaged 8.3 points, 3.5 assists, 1.9 steals and 1.0 blocks per game. He led the Pac-12 with 69 steals on the season, and led the team’s comeback victory over Texas A&M to keep the Trojans dancing during March Madness.

President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality stood in front of the Senate Environmental Committee on Wednesday for her hearing. In line with Trump’s policies and public condemnation of environmentally regulatory policies, Kathleen Hartnett White is a climate change denier and does not believe that carbon emissions are harmful to the environment. Along with Scott Pruitt, director of the Environmental Protection Agency, the two most powerful officials in charge of environmental regulatory agencies are both fervently opposed to regulations to combat climate change. These choices are irresponsible and short-sighted, but of course, not unexpected. 
But federal appointments and policymaking aren’t the only ways to enact meaningful change — for better or for worse — regarding the environment and climate change. The president and U.S. senators aren’t the only ones who have a voice in this fight.
Millennials, ranging from college students to young professionals in the work force, have a responsibility to set a precedent for our generation moving forward. College students have the power to pressure their universities to invest in sustainable development research as well as improve college campus policies, like recycling programs, to ensure environmental responsibility. 
For example, USC students can urge the University to divest from fossil fuels, not only affecting the economics of these companies that produce them but also taking a symbolic stance against them. In the workforce, millennials can push their individual workplaces to take action, but also attempt to shift industries in a different direction. Sustainability and economic development are not mutually exclusive, and it is a pity that our current presidential administration paints this relationship as such. 
Therefore, millennials have the power and responsibility to encourage funding and new development to funnel into green technology, renewable energy and sustainability research. If millennials cement this as the future of our economy, we have the ability to dismantle the idea that sustainability comes at the cost of the economy. There is a possibility for cooperation, but having a climate change denier leading the EPA is certainly not the way to go.

Having officials such as Pruitt and White who are “unsure” about whether climate change is a reality or not is detrimental to the progress made under the previous presidential administration and threatens the future of our planet, and our futures as young people. Once again, corporate interests are prioritized above long-term protections and development in the environmental sector. Some of these corporations put up facades of sustainability initiatives and PR campaigns to promote “environmentally friendly” corporate policies. But, the truth of the matter is that having people like Pruitt and White in these roles makes it exponentially easier to profit — especially if it comes at the cost of the environment. When scientific facts are tossed aside to further political agendas and benefit corporate donors, regulatory agencies like the EPA and the CEQ become dangerously ineffective and counterproductive to their established mission. 
As the most sustainability-conscious generation, millennials have more information and accessibility to environmentally friendly products and practices and overall have a greater sense of urgency when it comes to such problems. But these attitudes often do not carry into activism or policy changes the same way that millennials organize for reproductive rights or immigration. Environmental policy and regulation are incredibly important, but have not been considered a hot-button issue. 
As the next generation of leaders, policymakers, environmental engineers and researchers, millennials must decide that environmentalism is a priority and mobilize in that direction. While funding and manpower in this sector have increased and more and more students are studying in this field, this administration has the potential to create irreversible damage. Potentially motivating other countries to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement, for example, would stunt international environmental movements in a significantly harmful way. Therefore, millennials must participate in civic engagement with the same rigor and force that they have for other issues. 
Time is running out for the millennial generation to tackle environmental issues proactively instead of retroactively. The consequences of our actions are here and visible — floods, droughts, an increase in extreme weather conditions and, in poorer parts of the country, lack of access to clean air and water. 
If the administration and its corresponding agencies will not take responsibility for pushing our country in a positive direction, then it is up to this generation to shoulder the burden. The power is in the people, like it has been with several other issues, and it is time to tackle this issue head-on, rather than waiting until it is too late.

With a few quick clicks you can send meals across continents through the World Food Programme, and here at USC, a short Lyft ride will take you to Skid Row, where you can join organizations like Share a Meal in passing out food and hygiene kits to thousands of homeless Angelenos.
But homelessness and hunger hit much closer to home than around the world, or across our city.
The most recent data from the Free Application for Federal Student Aid revealed that there are 58,000 homeless students on campuses nationwide. And according to the College and University Food Bank Alliance and other campus-based organizations, nearly half of U.S. college students have trouble putting food on the table. In our own state, about one in 10 of California State University’s 460,000 students are homeless, and one in five do not have steady access to food.
Although USC and most private universities have not released their own data, we know that our campus is not an outlier. While tents line the street just blocks away, within our own gates an untold number of students seek refuge in the 24-hour Leavey Library, couch surf and attempt to make do without a place to return home. And the recent expansion of USC’s Virtual Food Pantry, which provides $25 Trader Joe’s gift cards to food insecure students, reflects a persistent, if not growing, need for greater food affordability and accessibility.
With rising tuition and costs of living in Los Angeles, it’s never been harder to put food on the table and to find keys to a home. Zumper, a housing rental website, noted in 2015 that the average rent increased by over 15 percent in the area surrounding USC between 2006 and 2013, and Rentcafe lists 90007, USC’s regional ZIP code, as the second-most expensive ZIP code for rentals in Los Angeles County in 2015. And as USC’s student body continues to diversify economically, these financial strains will only grow larger. In fact, among the top 25 private universities, USC enrolls disproportionately more low-income students, with 23 percent of Trojans eligible for Pell grants.
And although USC Village has made headway in alleviating the burden of housing on some students, new and expensive restaurants, which do not accept dining or discretionary dollars, exclude many socioeconomic demographics of students.
The 2013 National College Health Assessment found about one-third of U.S. college students struggling to function over the course of a year due to depression, and almost half of participants reported feeling overwhelming anxiety. Psychologists, counselors, administrators, parents and students often pore over studies such as these, isolating competitiveness, student loans and other factors as those which contribute to this epidemic of anxiety and depression. But how often do we consider the physiological and psychological toll of going to class on an empty stomach and ending the day without a home?
In fact, several studies link students grappling with food insecurity to higher likelihoods of experiencing stress, lower grade point averages and almost a 10 percent reduction in the likelihood of graduating.
Admissions brochures emphasize how the college experience facilitates students’ ability to thrive, but these rose-tinted glasses fall flat when it becomes a daily struggle to simply survive for many students. In light of increasing anxiety, competitiveness and financial burdens before and after college, the least the University can do for students is provide them with a safety net to ensure that no one goes hungry and everyone can return to a home at night.
Ensuring that basic needs are met should not be a foreign concept to schools. While public schools offer free or subsidized lunches to students, over 100 universities operate food pantries and many, such as USC, provide voucher programs. And though USC recently launched the USC Initiative to Eliminate Homelessness, emergency housing, food subsidies and Food Stamp navigators, for example, represent bold and desperately needed programs and policies to alleviate what amounts to a campus and national crisis.
With these issues emerging out of the shadows and into the light, the impetus falls on us, students, to guarantee housing and food not only as a privilege, but also as a right.
