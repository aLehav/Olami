Without the advantage of going to an arts school but with hopes of an introduction into the world of fashion, five USC students from varying backgrounds in business, art and technology and differing levels of expertise were awarded the Fashion Scholarship Fund in January. 
Each year, the organization invites young talent to become new contributors to the industry, providing career-building, mentorship and networking events in addition to financial assistance. This year’s scholarship applicants designed and presented products such as clothes and handbags for the collaboration of two major brands of their choosing, one fashion-affiliated and one unaffiliated. 
The five scholarship recipients, coming from Iovine and Young Academy and the Marshall School of Business, brainstormed ideas for products that told the story of unconventional collaborations between companies such as major fashion houses and museums, or apparel brands and potato chips.
Sydney Loew, a sophomore in IYA, said she had an appreciation for fashion even before she was introduced to the scholarship opportunity by IYA assistant professor Steve Barth. She proposed a design partnership between Gucci and Google and said it was because of the alliteration between the brand names and the shared values of each of the companies. 
“After further research, I found that Google wants to bolster their hardware product lines, and Gucci wants to become a more accessible brand to more people without lowering their price,” Loew said.
Although she has experience in different aspects of the fashion world, including serving as fashion ambassador in the Office of Admission and as visual director for Haute Magazine, a fashion- and design-oriented magazine on campus, she said the Fashion Scholarship Fund exposed her to more of the industry. 
“I noticed how much business and thought and strategy goes behind visual design, which opened my eyes to new possibilities of how to monetize design and where I might want to go with it,” Loew said. “There’s a lot that happens in one industry. There’s so many details that only fashion people know.” 
According to Barth, who coaches the student contestants, the scholarship looks for innovators in the fashion world. 
“The organization looks to the competition to bring new people and new ideas into the industry to keep it innovating and to keep it alive,” Barth said. 
For some of the winners, it was their first experience in the fashion industry. Irene Chen, a sophomore in IYA, had never done anything related to fashion before but said she learned a lot from the experience.
“I think I definitely became more interested in fashion and what it means to me afterward,” Chen said. 
In her application, Chen proposed a collaboration between Louis Vuitton and the Smithsonian Institution because of Louis Vuitton’s previous artistic collaborations and her experiences with the Smithsonian museums from living near Washington. 
For his submission, Gbenga Komolafe designed a collaboration between Tommy Hilfiger and “Better Angels,” a nonprofit geared toward reducing partisan rhetoric in politics through organized debate events. According to Komolafe, applying to the fund was a way to continue paving his way in the fashion industry. 
“I have my own clothing brand and I’ve been making clothes for four or five years now,” Komolafe said. “So I just thought it would be a good opportunity to get more insight into the industry and make connections.”
Mark Veksler, a sophomore in IYA, said because of the high demand from the competition, many students don’t complete their work in time for submission. However, he said Barth and Marshall School of Business associate professor Dennis Schorr helped students with the process by providing information sessions on marketing techniques and collaborative workshops with professors from other universities.
“I think they really helped us, and they really motivated us because they didn’t want the 60% of us to drop before submitting,” Veksler said. “I think that they were successful with retaining [students].”
Even without a dedicated fashion design program at USC, Loew said the skills they gained in IYA courses gave them enough foundation to build a successful submission of detailed technical designs and marketing strategies.
“[We’ve been taught] how to communicate new ideas,” Loew said. “We have this whole vocabulary to do it and this whole methodology to do it.” 
Despite competing against students from schools with specialized fashion programs, Barth said USC students had no trouble finding success because of their hard work and dedication. 
“It’s the diligence of the students who are willing to compensate for that huge advantage the fashion school has over a non-fashion school,” Barth said.
Yuanyi Ma, a sophomore majoring in business administration, focused her collaboration between Urban Outfitters and Lays potato chips, two brands where she found an overlap in a targeted youth demographic and values. 
Ma said she wants to keep learning and exploring the intersection between business and design in the world of fashion. With the feedback and notes she received on her recent submission, she wants to improve her work in time for next year’s scholarship competition. 
“I feel like there’s always something I could improve on,” Ma said. “So I want to know the score and hopefully make some changes next year.”
Barth said he hopes to see even more students apply for the scholarship next year. 
“I hope that USC’s strong performance this year will encourage more students to learn about and enter next year’s case competition,” Barth said.

Gould School of Law was ranked No. 10 last week among the top 50 most difficult U.S. law schools to get into by USA Today. The ranking used an index made by 24/7 Wall Street based on information from the American Bar Association, taking into consideration the schools’ acceptance rates as well as the median GPA and LSAT scores of the incoming Fall 2019 class. 
Gould received 5,648 applications for Fall 2019 and had a 17.7% acceptance rate, a median undergraduate GPA of 3.8 and median LSAT score of 166 out of 180 for the incoming class. Gould has an 86% passage rate for the bar exam. 
“Obviously, a low acceptance rate is reflective of the strong desire there is for an education [at Gould],” said David Kirschner, associate dean of admissions at Gould. “It requires an ability to kind of try and discern from that huge pool, including far too many who are admissible.”
Barry Croxen, a first-year Gould student, said he believes the ranking demonstrates Gould’s status as a top law school due to the merit of the students.
“A lot of us work really hard to get here, so it’s good to get some national recognition on that scale,” Croxen said. “Everybody works really hard to get into law school so I think it’s an accomplishment just to be here.” 
Kirschner said that the acceptance rate has dropped nearly in half in the last few years from a 34% admittance in 2016. The 2019 entering J.D. class comprises 40% students of color and 57% women. 
“We’re really proud of that commitment to diversity, so selectivity has definitely not come at the expense of diversity in any sense of the word,” Kirschner said. “I think that’s a testament — we wouldn’t be able to get those students to choose to enroll [at Gould] if we didn’t offer both the educational opportunities they’re looking for and the outcomes that they’re looking for.” 
Kirschner said Gould has consistently brought in more students with work experience and varied backgrounds. Of the 204 first-year students in the Class of 2022, 40% came from outside California, and 17% identify as having low socioeconomic status. 
“I don’t necessarily celebrate the acceptance rate [in being] the 10th most difficult law school to get into,” Kirschner said. “It is nice being mentioned in the same breath as [the other schools listed in the USA Today article]. But more than that, I think it’s reflective of the understanding of the quality and strength of a legal education here.”  
Kirshner said Gould is constantly evolving and redoubling the commitment to public service and public interest. Kirschner also added that Gould’s location in Los Angeles has been particularly advantageous in recent years, with its proximity to the entertainment industry and technological advances that are reflected in the school’s courses. 
“On the curricular front, there are tremendous options,” Kirschner said. “Our business law curriculum has added even more depth to it. Our media entertainment and technology program has grown even stronger with the advent of all the creative content that’s now produced for the internet.” 
Samantha Dyar, a first-year Gould student, said she chose the school because of the strong community and alumni network. She said the alumni mentorship programs are one of the resources that make Gould a top law school.
“[Gould alumni] have mentor lunches that they offer,” Dyar said. “Our first-generation professionals are also set up with a mentor to help them navigate the legal profession, and then a bunch of us just had mock interviews with [alumni].”
First-year law student Erin Joslin said that the ranking is well deserved because of Gould’s strong curriculum and invested professors.
“I really liked the clinics that are offered here, like the Post-Conviction Justice Project,” Joslin said. “The professors here are truly top-notch. Every single teacher is so invested in us learning and is really at the top of their field, which is super impressive.” 
Madeleine Messinger, a second-year Gould student, said she was surprised by the selective ranking because it is significantly higher than Gould’s No. 17 national law school ranking from the U.S. News & World Report. However, she agreed the school’s excellence is exemplified by its student body. 
“[Gould has] really high quality students,” Messinger said. “It doesn’t surprise me that it’s a really hard school to get into — who wouldn’t want to go here?”

Four presidential tickets discussed efforts to increase the availability of mental health resources, the need for administrative transparency and plans to improve campus sustainability during Wednesday’s Undergraduate Student Government presidential debate. 
The debate, which was hosted in partnership with Annenberg Media, drew more than 100 students to Wallis Annenberg Hall to hear candidates Truman Fritz and Rose Ritch; Christopher McMorran and Trinity Lee; Sara Khoshniyati and Rohit Bolla; and Christine Nguyen and Miles Kay before the voting period opens Tuesday. 
Discussion began with the candidates’ positions on mental health and wellness in light of frustrations with Engemann Student Health Center over the last few years regarding the student-to-counselor ratio and counselor diversity and availability. Candidates acknowledged the student-led push for more mental health resources on campus despite larger changes within USC Student Health such as the implementation of the new mental health floor in Engemann, which is expected to be fully staffed by Fall 2020. 
Nguyen, who currently serves as USG marketing assistant director, called mental health a systemic issue that affects all communities at USC and said Student Health has implemented insufficient strategies to resolve this issue. To ameliorate this, Nguyen and Kay, who has not held a position in USG, said they plan to incorporate mental health programming into all aspects on campus through the implementation of school-specific wellness initiatives.  
“The reality of the matter is that although we push Engemann to do better, it’s simply not working,” Nguyen said. “So our strategy is to make sure we integrate mental health into as many areas of student life as possible.”
Fritz, who currently serves as USG senior director of communications, said there is a need to increase mental health resources by allocating more funding toward mental health services and a need to reduce the surrounding stigma through initiatives such as Seize the Awkward, a campaign that gives students the means to facilitate conversations among peers regarding mental health. 
“[USC] does not put money into student health, that is what has created longer wait lines, restricted hours, off-campus referrals,” Fritz said. “All these things that we face on a daily basis go back to where the money is. If administrators are focused on the student-first mentality, they should focus on putting money where students are.”
Candidate also addressed the need for more accountability and stronger transparency between administration and students. Sen. McMorran said the recent failures of the University are due to the lack of connection between the student body and the Board of Trustees. Several tickets, including his and Lee’s, referenced plans to incorporate student representation on the Board. 
“The key to getting all of them done is having more student representation in the highest levels of University decision-making,” McMorran said. “By having a student there, that will allow us to really reach out and make sure that trustees … are actually aware of how these issues like mental health, sustainability and accountability, can be solved.” 
Fritz and Sen. Ritch agreed it was necessary to place a student on the Board, recommending the creation of advisory councils made up of students that would directly work with administration. 
“We need to have representation in every single aspect of this administration,” Ritch said. “We deserve to have a voice in all of these big changes that are being made. We deserve to know what’s going on, and I think this begins with implementing these advisory councils and [having] students working directly with the administration.” 
Nguyen said she wants campus leaders to have the opportunity to attend Board meetings with President Carol Folt and other senior administrators to enhance student representation on the Board.
“We think that it would be so beneficial to increase transparency, increase student representation and to prevent communication dilution by implementing a way to personally extend an invitation to campus leaders to come to these meetings,” Nguyen said. 
Fritz and Ritch said they will continue their ongoing plan to eliminate nonessential single-use plastics in on-campus restaurants and dining facilities by directly working with campus stores to stop selling plastic products. 
“USG needs to act as a flagship for sustainable education, whether it’s in programming, whether it’s putting money toward funding resources and restarting the Green Engagement Fund or whether it’s creating resources around sustainable practices and programming for recognized student organizations on campus,” Fritz said.
Following the Investment Office’s release of fossil fuel investment numbers last week, Sen. Khoshniyati and Bolla, who currently serves as the USG philanthropy fund assistant director, emphasized the importance of fossil fuel divestment and improving sustainability within dining halls. Currently, 5% of the University’s endowment, or $277 million, is invested in fossil fuels. 
The Sara & Rohit ticket said it plans on implementing an online learning module for sustainability education similar to the AlcoholEdu course all incoming first-year students are required to take before completing their first semester on campus.
“We agree that we should get rid of single-use plastic cups and increase compost bins on campus, but we believe that the future of sustainability is focused on divesting away from fossil fuels,” Khoshniyati said. “These are conversations that we need to have with administrators and this is the future of USC actually being green.” 
Nguyen and Kay extended their platform emphasis of sustainability to education, saying they plan to teach sustainability to students and organizations throughout the USC community. 
“The platform that Miles and I are running on is making sure that each individual, down to their very core, knows what sustainability looks like in their own life,” Nguyen said.
Khoshniyati reiterated the intention of engaging student voters in the electoral process of determining the next leaders of the student body. 
“Where we see problems, we’ve identified feasible solutions we can implement next year,” Khoshniyati said. “The legacy of this institution has been at stake and students really have the most important role in shaping that. The University of Southern California has never been in a more exciting position for change.”

The USC men’s volleyball team is gearing up to take on another ranked opponent in No. 15 UC San Diego at 7 p.m. Thursday. The Trojans, who are now 2-7 on the season, are looking for a bounceback after a close four-set loss to No. 4 UC Irvine last week.
This game is a departure from Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference play and the team’s second west coast road game following a 3-2 set win at California State Northridge. The young team had to face high-level competition early in the season on the east coast with losses against No. 11 George Mason, No. 9 Penn State and No. 15 Ohio State and is now hungry to regain its ranked status from the preseason.
“I still think that we’re a top-three team in the nation,” redshirt sophomore outside hitter Billy Fauntleroy said. “We’re a young team, we’re just still learning how to play together. These young guys are learning how to play at a much higher level than they were half a year ago.”
USC isn’t the only one coming in with a tough pre-conference schedule. The Tritons have had big wins against Loyola-Chicago, No. 12 Princeton and most recently No. 14 Concordia and improved to 8-3 overall. 
A five-underclassmen lineup will have to hone in on in-game adjustments and anticipate UCSD’s offensive plays. The Trojans were outblocked 13-6 by Irvine with USC junior setter Chris Hall logging more successful blocks than all pin hitters combined.
While middle blockers junior Sam Lewis and senior Vecas Lewin were able to cover ground and stop five Irvine hits, outside hitters have to recognize the setter’s move on the other side of the net and anticipate where the opposing hitter will be in time to block shots.
In the week’s practices leading up to the San Diego trip, head coach Jeff Nygaard focused on the front row’s footwork and across-the-court reading.
“That’s a space that I think we definitely have to put some time and energy into so that [we can say] ‘Hey, this guy’s going to hit this hit. We’ve got to get four hands in this space across the net to shut it down,’” Nygaard said. “If we can execute that well, then our defense is going to all of a sudden have these big open spaces that they know exactly where to be.”
The Trojans’ net coverage will continue to be a necessity in stopping point runs. In UCSD’s three-set sweep over Concordia, junior outside hitter Kyle McCauley had 11 kills, followed by junior opposite hitter Collin Shannon’s nine kills that contributed to the offense’s .258 efficiency. 
Of the Tritons’ eight wins, four have been three-set sweeps with multi-point leads perpetuated by winning the blocking game, something that USC is looking to accomplish this weekend.
On USC’s side of the net, look out for offensive production from true freshman outside hitter Adam Flood, who led the team with 13 kills in his third game as a Trojan. Hall continues to prove his value as a key asset beyond his setting skills by leading the team in digs and making an impressionable impact in serving.
Overall, the Trojans are looking to kickstart conference play with a win that would turn around their road struggles and build positive in-game experience to look back on in order to further improve their season record.
“To me, it has nothing to do with the school or the ranking,” Nygaard said. “It’s what are we going to come in as, so I expect us to go in there with the effort that we can win a match, with the mentality, with the game plan, with the energy, with passion — everything you want that we can go down there and compete for the W.”

Many times, football sense and common sense are aligned. In these moments, fans, coaches and players alike are unified in rational thinking around the game of football. From Marshawn Lynch running the ball on the 2-yard line to USC firing head coach Clay Helton, there is often something beautiful about rational observers unifying in agreement over events that should have happened.
In many of these situations — such as the latter described above — the decision makers in the locker room and front office disagree with, if not outright defy, the whims and wishes of the common fan in favor of what makes sense for football operations. Such moments of cognitive dissonance between supporters and staff are often confusing and only work to sow further discontent between these two parties. USC’s 2020 recruiting class is the perfect example of this concept.
These are not happy times to be a part of the Trojan faithful. From the corruption of Heritage Hall to the calamity at the Coliseum, fans have been vocal in their displeasure with players, coaches, trainers, administrators and now, finally, recruiters.
With National Signing Day and the 2020 recruiting season now officially in the rearview, USC is in distinctly unprecedented territory. According to 247Sports Composite ratings, the Trojans’ class ranks No. 55 in the nation. This is good for 10th in the Pac-12 and places USC behind mediocre programs such as Oregon State, Georgia Tech and — possibly most damning of all — crosstown rival UCLA. Let that sink in: The Trojans are worse off in appealing to the next generation of talent than a team that has gone 7-17 over the last two seasons and publicly requires a campus bailout to recoup the millions of dollars they have lost over that time span.
In short, USC’s brand appears to be in freefall with no ground in sight.
From another view, such as that of the battered coach Helton, this class was purely about filling on-field needs. As much as it may pain me to admit, his point may be valid.
In a season filled with nearly as much good as bad, one of the bright spots for USC was a resurgent offensive line under the tutelage of Tim Drevno. Assuming full-time offensive line duties after the dismissal of Neil Callaway, Drevno helped USC return to form, clocking in as the 31st best offensive line in the nation according to Pro Football Focus. While the presence of veterans such as the now-departed Austin Jackson and Drew Richmond aided the line’s play in 2019, Drevno has earned the reputation as an effective guide for developing linemen. 
To this end, USC did as much to help bolster that line by going out and picking up six linemen, all clocking in at above 6-foot-5, 280 pounds and giving Drevno even more raw talent to develop over the coming seasons. Despite only signing one four-star recruit in the bunch, the physical dominance and geographic diversity of these new Trojans will aid USC on the field and on the recruiting trail.
Due credit to Helton and his original aims, the average fan will not understand or excuse this strategy, and neither will the average recruit — or the elite recruit, for that matter.
USC has, over the past year, become one of the easiest schools to recruit against in college football. It was once said that USC, Helton and all, could recruit itself, but now it seems like that brand only works to push recruits away. Each passing day, Trojan football looks more like a toxic program with toxic leadership, and a passionate fanbase turned toxic by the immobility and incompetence of those at the wheel in Heritage Hall.
Reggie Bush put it squarely: Recruits aren’t getting fooled anymore.
He was proven right dozens of times this season as blue chip locals such as Bryce Young, Justin Flowe and Jalen McMillan fled southern California for Alabama, Oregon and Washington.
It is by the wise words and instant recognition of Reggie Bush that I propose a solution; a dastardly, unspeakable fix for the embattled Trojan program.
Bring Reggie back.
Certainly Bush has enjoyed his time working for Fox Sports, but with his NCAA ban set to expire this June, the ball will be in USC’s court to bring him back to campus. 
I say: Why stop there? 
With Ed Reed getting hired to be the chief of staff at his alma mater in Miami, why can’t the Trojans give a needed shot in the arm to their brand and put Reggie back on top? What recruit in Southern California could honestly say no when Reggie hands them a chance to play in cardinal and gold?
If Helton has any sense to return USC’s brand back to anything near blue chip, he will bet the house on the return of Bush.
Every kingdom needs a crown jewel. Troy needs Reggie.

Coming off a tough home loss against No. 20 Colorado, the USC men’s basketball team, which has won 11 of its last 14, will look to rebound against No. 23 Arizona in Tucson Thursday. The Wildcats will challenge USC defensively after sweeping their two-game Washington road trip against Washington and Washington State.
Although the Trojans have lost nine straight games in Tucson, the squad is 7-2 away from Galen Center this season and has seemed to be largely unaffected by hostile environments.
“We feel very comfortable on the road,” head coach Andy Enfield said after practice Monday, per the Orange County Register. “It’s hard to explain. This team is different than some previous teams. But you can say that if you go into Arizona and you don’t play well, it’s going to be a long night.”
Led by elite freshmen such as guards Nico Mannion and Josh Green and forward Zeke Nnaji, the Wildcats play at a high pace, leading the Pac-12 in scoring and coming in at third in 3-point shooting. USC will need a big scoring night from senior guard Jonah Mathews and sophomore guard Elijah Weaver to match that production. 
The Trojans are at their best when these two start to heat up. The duo combined for 29 points on 70.6% shooting from the field in a 20-point win at Oregon State a couple of weeks ago. 
They also scored a combined 18 points on 30.4% shooting from the field in the 21-point loss to Colorado. If they can’t get going Thursday, keeping up with the Wildcats won’t be easy. 
Freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu will be tested early and will try to stop Nnaji, who leads the Wildcats in scoring, rebounds, blocked shots and field goal percentage. The two have eerily similar stats, with both hovering at around 16.5 points per game on 61% shooting to go along with nine rebounds per game. Nnaji has a few inches on Okongwu, but the Trojan has proved his defensive prowess all season. Expect this matchup to be competitive and one that could heavily alter the course of the game.
For the offense to be at full strength, Okongwu needs to be involved early and often. As teams focus their defensive efforts on stopping him from getting the ball down low, ball movement and outside shooting will be pivotal.
“We’re not going to be able to just get the ball to [Okongwu] in the post,” freshman guard Ethan Anderson said. “No team’s going to just sit there and let that happen. So we’re going to have to [make] five to six passes around, make somebody else attack and they’ll have to leave [Okongwu to defend] a layup and then get it to [Okongwu].”
Crashing the boards hard will also be pivotal, as USC and Arizona rank first and second respectively in the Pac-12 in rebounds per game. Arizona struggled mightily with rebounding earlier in the season but has since turned it into a strength during conference play. 
The 56-52 win against Utah showed that the Trojans can win low-scoring games thanks to their top-tier defense, which ranks third in the conference in blocked shots and top-five in points allowed per game, opposing rebounding totals and opposing field goal percentage. USC will need to continue to win gritty games to boost its resume for the Pac-12 and NCAA tournaments that are fast approaching.
USC and Arizona will tip off Thursday at 6 p.m. at McKale Center.

Swipe left, swipe right. Super Like and start a chat. Why not, am I right? 
Online dating apps — Bumble, Christian Mingle, FarmersOnly, if you will — have monopolized the dating frontier, with 75% of young adults using Tinder. Digitized dating has grown so rapidly in popularity, not only because of its quick accessibility but because of its methodical approach to finding a partner. 
Think about it — these dating apps are categorization mechanisms. When swiping, we have access to such little information that we are forced to look to a mere 10 pictures and a 500-character biography to sort our interests and form an opinion about someone else. 
Thus, our modern idea of romance is a swipe-fest that promotes superficiality and undermines inner beauty, and it only contradicts the prominent trope that love has no labels or boundaries. We must consider this paradox of looking for authenticity through superficial means and what it says about our perception of the meet-cute, an almost too-good-to-be-true first encounter between two people.
In these apps, artificiality manifests in the form of labels. Swiping through my own Tinder — that’s right, I have credentials — they pop up left and right, literally. And height is one of the most common characteristics I come across. 
A particular line resonated with me recently: “6-foot-1, because I guess that matters.” 
This line acknowledges the shallow nature of a culture that heavily glamorizes height but simultaneously feeds into it. We have a love-hate relationship with this kind of cosmeticity. Height may be a physical feature that disregards personality, and we know it is unhealthy to prioritize it so much. Yet we succumb to the cultural toxicity and use physicality to make ourselves more desirable and swipeable. 
Don’t even get me started on Grindr. While the app is primarily meant for spawning gay hookups, it also has the overwhelming effect of dichotomizing in nearly every way possible — tops and bottoms, mascs versus fems, twinks or otters. These binaries are all hallmarks of the gay community, so they will naturally be inflated. At times, though, these labels are yet another way of limiting oneself to surface-level pursuits. 
Part of this labeling obsession is rather simple — we love convenient intimacy exactly the way we want it. But at the end of the day, these superficial tendencies have negative consequences. This trend of popularizing labels reinforces toxic body standards, such as magnifying a nearly unattainable golden physique.   
Moving beyond the surface, perhaps there are other reasons we keep coming back for more. This ease of swiping, combined with the attention we receive on these apps, is addictive. This could be just a matter of boredom, but what if it reflected a different part of us that subconsciously enjoys this acrimony? 
Perhaps some of us never moved past our teenage angst phases and we actually use these apps as methods of self-destruction. We continually reinforce the labeling system because we are innate masochists, stuck in our nihilistic ways. This dependency is not necessarily enjoyable, but it renders us unavailable emotionally — just the way some of us like it. 
Nonetheless, this obsession with labeling is not going anywhere. Our generation is drifting in the direction of a new meet-cute that swaps old-fashioned spontaneity for a contemporary, systematic match-and-dash.
On the plus side, this can be very beneficial for the LGBTQ community, which actually uses these dating apps nearly twice as often as straight single people. This makes sense, considering that the LGBTQ community comprises only about 4.5% of the United States population. To put this into perspective, one is statistically more likely to randomly meet a partner on the street as straight than they are to meet one as an LGBT identifying individual. These apps are a utility, an innovation that has changed the dating realm regardless of sexuality. 
However, we should still work to alleviate the emphasis on labels. Why do we always have to label everything? For a moment, we could forget about it all and disregard our labeling system to move beyond the shallow. With great power comes great responsibility, and we should not let this technology eradicate whatever authenticity we have left. 
After all, meeting your significant other at Trader Joe’s is a pretty good meet-cute if you ask me.

It’s no secret that while USC has continued to grow, it has had an increasingly insular institutional culture grow with it as well in recent years. President Carol Folt’s appointment in the Fall speaks volumes in changing this, but one person can only do so much, especially in the face of the Board of Trustees.
Last semester, the Board adopted sweeping changes that Chair Rick Caruso described in an article in the Los Angeles Times as “really big and meaningful.” Since taking charge of the Board in 2018, Caruso had pledged to shift the Board to a culture of “open-mindedness, being inclusive and being open to learning.” 
Last semester’s changes, which includes term limits and a 40% decrease of the number of seats, seemed like a step — albeit a small one — in the right direction, especially in what has been seen as stasis and difficulty in oversight by the Board. However, it is evident that Caruso’s reforms are not institutional in nature, especially as what matters most is the content of the work carried out by the Board, not its structure.
If Caruso does want the Board to be “more engaged, more authentic, …  and really be more connected to the campus,” then much more needs to be done. Students and faculty should be given seats on the governing board and committees to bridge an institutional disconnect. Giving students, faculty and staff — true University stakeholders — power to observe and vote would allow for longstanding concerns to advance more quickly to the Board.
The Board of Trustees must be transparent so that student concerns are directly amplified to those in control of USC. Student representation must be a key part of the University’s decision-making, especially with what seems to be a diverging moral and ethical priority between administration and students.
Last week, more than 100 students rallied at Tommy Trojan, calling for further transparency regarding University fossil fuel investments. The Investment Office subsequently released that 5% of the University’s endowment — nearly $277 million — funds fossil fuel investments. Historically, endowment spending has been kept a mystery to the public, but when these priorities diverge, it is important for the University to be transparent. A student seat on the Board of Trustees would be a step in this direction.
Filling this position through popular vote by graduate and undergraduate students would provide quite a different perspective to the Board, bridging the gap between the lived experiences of students and the small group of wealthy and powerful people that make up the Board.
In the past decade, USC pushed tremendously to rebrand and cement itself as a top-tier university. In academics, research, donations, athletics and the like, everything seems to follow this push to become even better, but to truly lead the way forward, USC must advocate for its own stakeholders — students, faculty and staff — and establish at least one seat for each on the governing board and committees.
Cornell University leads the way in this administrative transparency, seating two elected students on its Board of Trustees — it is the only Ivy League university to do so. Rutgers and Penn State also employ similar policies.
Moving forward, USC must ensure that students, faculty and staff are in the conversation of key decisions and at the forefront of how decisions are made. Provost task forces, campus culture sessions and town halls are small steps forward, but what needs to occur is lasting change.
This idea of codetermination can give students, faculty and staff a tangible stake and voice in the involvement of USC. Establishing this seat is a continuation of the small changes in USC’s insular culture that we have already begun to see, and in reality, this proposal fundamentally reassesses the nature of who — and what — the Board of Trustees is meant to serve. 
Last November in the same Los Angeles Times article, Caruso said that the discussion of adding faculty and student representation to the Board was “going to come down the road.” He added that the Board was “still taking this [process] in pieces.” 
USC cannot be incremental in change. It is Folt and the Board of Trustees’ responsibility to be bold in change, substantively reversing the direction in which USC has been heading.
USC’s mission statement contains a phrase that particularly stands out in this discussion: “USC is pluralistic.” Codetermination by way of student, faculty and staff representation on the Board of Trustees extends this pluralism and serves as a necessary starting point for change on our campus.

It seems like no one will shut up about political correctness. In particular, comedians won’t shut up about political correctness, especially those who have been defined by a transgressive sense of humor. But rightfully so — for many of them, this phenomenon affects the very core of what Comedy with a capital C is all about.
You likely already have an idea of what I mean by the term “political correctness.” You might think of the general discomfort you feel when people start talking loosely about ideas involving race, gender, sexuality or other topics of social debate. The ideas themselves might not make you uncomfortable, but the feeling of saying something the wrong way might. You might think of a bunch of eager college kids trying to “cancel” someone they deem problematic. You might think it’s a term invented by uncreative jerks who get bitter when people rightfully criticize them for being, well, uncreative jerks. 
In fact, it’s all of the above. There’s no exact definition, but, as far as it relates to Comedy, I would broadly define “political correctness” as the avoidance to discuss, joke about or laugh at the use of certain words, subjects or ideas that public opinion deems offensive. If it sounds broad, don’t worry — that’s by design. 
Still, what’s missing from the conversation is that this idea of political correctness has existed long before the election of President Donald Trump. There are some topics you can talk loosely about, and there are some you shouldn’t discuss or joke about. Thirty years ago, joking about religion was considered taboo; now, it’s become the norm for our increasingly secular society. Standards change as our culture changes — this is not exactly the most radical concept. So, this begs the question: Why does this seem to be such a recent phenomenon?
As significant as the 2016 presidential election was, it’s my observation that we haven’t quite come to terms with just how much our culture has changed in its wake. For Trump’s detractors, there’s a rush to prove to the world who we are and what we stand for. We aren’t “them” — aka the people who want to watch the world burn — and we want to show we’re allies every step of the way.
Do people go overboard sometimes? Absolutely. I don’t think there’s a single reasonably-minded person who hasn’t felt that way at some point. The race to be the most “woke” is littered with a lot of un-woke ideas, but they usually don’t gain any sustained traction. The marketplace of ideas succeeds, and the pendulum eventually swings back the other way.
But what does this mean for Comedy? Many traditional comics have railed about political correctness in interviews and in their sets (think Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, Ricky Gervais among many, many others). It really boils down to one thing: Crowds are harder to please than ever. People seem to laugh a lot less and are cautious toward more subjects, and individual styles of Comedy that were the norm a decade ago now seem dated.
Many comics embrace this so-called “woke culture” and have incorporated it into their Comedy in a variety of ways, but it’s a mixed bag overall. The explosion of political Comedy since the election has uplifted some pretty tired and gutless humor designed more for applause breaks than laughs. As charming as Trevor Noah can be, the Daily Show hasn’t exactly been the bastion of humor that it once was. Late-night hosts’ monologues barely rouse a chuckle out of me these days, and Netflix has seemingly handed out specials to anyone with 60 minutes of half-baked Trump jokes. It’s a cesspool of toothless Comedy meant more to reinforce one’s own identity as “us” rather than provoke insight or laughter.
This isn’t to say that there isn’t any genuinely great Comedy that’s embraced this movement. The most ambitious and successful of the bunch, at least in my opinion, is Anthony Jeselnik. Jeselnik has been a household name in stand-up for over a decade for his irreverent and creative style of dark Comedy. His brash and arrogant stage persona is all a part of the gag. On stage, he plays a horrible guy that says awful things, but there’s an underlying understanding that he doesn’t mean it for anything other than a chuckle — it’s just a persona. Sure, his humor might sound transgressive, but those with reasonable minds know that it’s not an endorsement of being a bad person. What kind of person doesn’t laugh at jokes, especially when they’re as concise, smart and well-written as Jeselnik’s?
With this in mind, I find it kind of ridiculous when people act like shock or edginess in Comedy is dead. Comedy clubs still book comics with a transgressive sense of humor all the time. Howard Stern is still on the air every single day. Burr and Chappelle are more popular than ever. Hell, Chappelle just won a Grammy for a special that was literally titled “Sticks & Stones,” and he was this year’s recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor — if that’s any indication of where our collective tastes still lie. 
There are still spaces in popular Comedy for transgressive humor, but it requires more talent and nuance to pull it off successfully. If that’s what it takes, is it really such a bad thing to raise our standards?

The tents of Smorgasburg L.A. seem, at first, to stretch on for miles. A lap of the lot will make the place seem a lot more manageable, but will inevitably bring a new set of problems. The event, held every Sunday on Alameda Street, brings in vendors from across Los Angeles, offering attendees a chance to sample an impressively diverse range of cuisines. 
But when all these sights and smells are competing for your attention, options quickly start to fade into a haze of chalkboard menus and faux rustic signage. Without a few destinations in mind, Smorgasburg will suck you in and, before you know it, you’ll find that you’re $80 down and it’s only been an hour. Quality, at least in this case, does not come cheap.
Sadly, neither did even the most mediocre of the dishes I tried: Brothecary, where I spent $10 on four dumplings, wasn’t bad, just bad value. It’s a perfect example of what can happen when you arrive without a plan and go straight to the first place you see. It’s a costly mistake — a waste of money as well as precious stomach space. So, here are a few recommendations to help you navigate the sprawl. If you’re looking for something more, I usually just try the place with the longest line. It’s not a very adventurous method for choosing where to eat, but it’s almost always a safe bet.
TACOS 1986
Price: $ 
I can’t incorporate $10 dumplings into my everyday diet, but at $3.25 for a generously stuffed taco, I could certainly afford another meal from Tacos 1986. I tried the adobada (pork marinated in a smoky chile sauce) and the carne asada. Both were more than worth the money, but the carne asada was my personal favorite. If you’re looking to visit during the week, Tacos 1986 also has a permanent spot in Downtown L.A.
CHINESE LAUNDRY 
Price: $$
Chinese Laundry only offers a few noodle dishes at its Smorgasburg location, which, at an event overflowing with options, is a blessing. The noodles are homemade throughout the day behind the stall, so they’re always fresh, and the spicy Sichuan broth isn’t so hot that it sacrifices flavor. The chef also operates Live Noodz, a stand on York Boulevard in Highland Park, which serves the same hand-pulled noodles (hence the name). One word of warning though: Avoid the roast duck. I could still feel the grease on my hands when I got home.
MOO’S CRAFT BARBECUE
Price: $$$
Far and away the best item of the trip, Moo’s Craft Barbecue’s beef ribs more than justified the $28 per pound price tag. It also offer a variety of other smoked meats, all sliced and weighed while you watch. Accordingly, the line is much longer and moves much more slowly — the crowd gathered around the stall is enough to make even the most determined foodie hesitate. But since Moo’s Craft Barbecue has no permanent location, Smorgasburg L.A. is one of the few places in the city you’ll be able to find ribs this good.
WANDERLUST CREAMERY
Price: $$
If you are looking for a more complex and impressive dessert, try Wanderlust Creamery next door. Each flavor takes inspiration from a notable world city or unique cuisine. While the theme is almost aggressively Instagram-friendly, it isn’t just a gimmick. The ube malted crunch is a great spin on a common flavor, and the sticky rice with mango is an admirable attempt to capture the original dish.
