Correction: A previous version of this article said “You and I” is a hit song by Sugarland. The song is from Lady Gaga’s album Born this Way.
 
To celebrate the end of the semester, my friends and I treated ourselves to attending the 2012 Grammy Nominations Concert at Nokia Theatre. The purpose of the hour-long show is to announce next year’s Grammy nominations, with performances interwoven throughout the program. The show, while entertaining overall, had its share of both hits and misses.
Best Performance: Lady Gaga and Sugarland, “You and I” duet
Who knew that the pop legend could rock it with the American country music duo? In a creative collaboration, the two acts teamed together to perform Lady Gaga’s hit, “You and I.” Sugarland’s lead singer, Jennifer Nettles, was absolutely excellent live, and her strong, clear vocals meshed well with Lady Gaga’s passionate singing. The pop star used her piano chops and flair for performance to add extra flavor to the song.
Worst Performance: Rihanna, “We Found Love” in London
My friends and I went into the concert thinking that Rihanna was actually performing at the Nokia Theatre, due to the advertising done for the show featuring her name as a headliner. As it turned out, the show lamely broadcasted a clip of her performing her hit “We Found Love” in London. Apparently we weren’t the only ones who were disappointed, as the mood in the audience significantly dipped as her clip was played.
Best Presenter: Bruno Mars
Bruno Mars, who was nominated for six awards, announced the nominees for Best New Artist. His delivery was smooth and playful, as he joked that winning a Grammy was a great feeling, followed by a wink (Bruno won his first Grammy last year for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for “Just the Way You Are”).
Worst Presenter: Katy Perry
The pop star, who has ruled the radio airwaves this past year, stumbled over several of her lines and simply looked awkward onstage as she announced the nominees for “Album of the Year.”
The Band Perry and Usher also performed, in addition to Jason Aldean and Ludaris and a large collaboration featuring Grandmaster Flash, LL Cool J, Common, and Lupe Fiasco.
Top nominees for next year’s Grammys include Kanye West, who led the pack with 7 nominations, followed by Adele, the Foo Fighters, and Bruno Mars, who racked up six nods each. For a full list of the 2012 Grammy Nominees, click here.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt has become a leader of collaboration with his production company hitRECord, which is set to release its new book, The Tiny Book of Tiny Stories: Volume 1, on Dec. 6.
hitRECord, established in 2005, has continued to grow as a collaborative community where writers, musicians, filmmakers, video editors, animators, photographers and illustrators create things together, all on the company’s website.
Thousands of collaborators were encouraged by Gordon-Levitt, known online as RegularJOE, to tell tiny stories through words and art. Tiny is the correct way to describe the few lined tales — short stories would be a huge exaggeration.
More than 8,500 contributions were brought together and edited to create the collection of original art. A total of 67 contributors from around the world are the masterminds behind each tiny illustration.
This is not the first time this project has popped up. An artist who goes by the username of Wirrow started the “Tiny Stories” collaboration back in 2010. A book of tiny stories already exists, but has less stories and contributors.
The upcoming Volume 1 release has about 45 illustrated stories. It is currently up for pre-sale and will be available next week on hitRECord’s website and at Barnes & Noble.
On Amazon.com, the book is already on the Best Sellers in Pop Culture Art list.

Abel Tesfaye’s musical experiment The Weeknd is due for another mix tape any time now. And while the world waits for the follow-up to the critically acclaimed and sonically brilliant Thursday, Tesfaye has indulged his fans with something that will definitely hold them over until the mix tape’s release date.
As musically striking as his records are, the music video to “The Knowing,” off of his first recorded mix tape House of Balloons, is similarly visually captivating — and even thought-provoking.
At an astounding eight minutes, the video is more of a fantasy epic, set to Tesfaye’s ironically severe production and lyrics. Mikael Colombu, the director of the work, combined startling, seemingly incoherent imagery and special effects shot in “2D Jankyvision” to create a piece of art that is moving — but you’re not really sure why.
And while its hard to make out most of the video, it seems to be loosely based on Ethiopian history. Stress the “loosely.” Between the random images of planets, medusa-like women and beating hearts the real message of this video is veiled heavily behind some hard-core modern art.
A look at the lyrics makes it even harder to figure out:
Take a look at what you did / You probably thought that you’d break my heart / You probably thought that you’d make me cry / But baby it’s okay / I swear it’s okay / I know everything
Here’s to wishing we knew everything about this video.
