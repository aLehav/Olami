Senior opposite hitter Katie Fuller led the Women of Troy to victory with a career-high 21 kills. Named the tournament’s MVP, Fuller showed her prowess all night, whether she was playing defense in the back row or hitting in the front. She came up just one dig shy of her fourth double-double of the season, recording nine digs in the match.
Facing set point at 22-24 in the first set, USC rallied behind two kills by freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio and some strong net play by freshman Alicia Ogoms to secure a 26-24 win.
The Women of Troy came out flat in the second set, falling behind 10-4 early. A block by Sara Shaw and strong serving by sophomore setter Hayley Crone knotted the match up at 11.
Despite being down 15-19 late in the set, USC powered through with Fuller and Bricio, who anchored both ends of the floor. In the end, Fuller notched two kills to break the tie before the women of Troy won the set, 25-22.
The Fuller show continued in the third and final set, as the captain continued dominating. Though the Irish came as close as 10-9, Bricio put together a string of three consecutive kills before a block by fellow freshman Ogoms stretched the lead to 18-13.
Crone, who had 43 assists on the match — not to mention 12 digs — took the third set to get her middle hitters involved, especially junior Alexis Olgard, who ended the match with eight kills.
The Women of Troy rounded out the tournament with three all-tournament selections, including Fuller, Bricio and junior libero Natalie Hagglund.
Prior to their Saturday final against the Irish, the Women of Troy took down No. 17 San Diego (3-2) on Friday night in a five-set thriller. Playing against their SoCal rivals, coach Mick Haley’s group seemed to be just a bit off.
“We made too many errors. We played a good first game, but our legs got rubbery. We have to relax and reduce our errors. Our three main hitters contributed 23 points to the opponent,” Haley said. “The setting was inconsistent because the passing was a problem. I think you have to give San Diego credit because they served us very tough and we didn’t handle it as well as I would have liked.”
Despite a subpar performance, the Women of Troy pulled through against a talented Toreros squad behind the play of Fuller, who not only had 17 kills but also set a career high with 18 digs on the night.
Before USC played Notre Dame on Saturday, the Trojans first knocked off Cal Poly (0-3) in three straight sets that afternoon. Led by Bricio and Ogoms, the Women of Troy easily took down the Mustangs to make the finals.
Now 9-0, the Women of Troy have put together a great start to the season. Such momentum will benefit them greatly as Pac-12 play nears.

Though not with the sheer dominance it has grown accustomed to, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team managed to remain undefeated Saturday with a 13-4 victory over Cal Baptist.
Scoring big · Junior driver Nikola Vavic scored four goals against Cal-Baptist on Saturday. He has helped lead the Trojans to a 4-0 record. record. – Daily Trojan file photo
 
In the Trojans’ home opener at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, senior two-meter Matt Burton scored 29 seconds into the match. From start to finish, the Trojans never trailed the Lancers (0-3), and the win improved the the Trojans’ record to 4-0.
Junior driver Nikola Vavic led the way with four goals while Burton notched his first hat trick of the season with three goals of his own.
Despite the lopsided score, USC struggled offensively in comparison to its first three games of the season, in which the team scored 20 or more goals in each.
Errant passes and mistimed shots littered the match, allowing the Division II Lancers to keep the score much closer than the 14-3 score from when the two teams played last year.
“We just have to be a little more patient offensively,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “We rushed things, so we need to do a better job finishing on our high-percentage opportunities.”
Burton added another perspective.
“With our training this week, guys are a little bit tired,” he said. “You start seeing guys shoot when they’re low in the water and the ball starts shooting really high [over the net].”
The performances from both of the Trojans’ goalies kept the score a lot lower than it could have been. Sophomore Ely Bonilla made eight saves, deflecting away many a shot from the Lancers’ primary offensive weapon, Scott Gleason.
Gleason finished with a hat trick, but the swarming Trojan defense limited the rest of the Lancers to just one goal.
Cal Baptist keeper Austen Ramer finished with six saves of his own between the pipes.
A slow start saw the Trojans leading just 2-1 until the final minute of the first quarter, where a goal by sophomore driver Jack Plaga gave USC a 3-1 lead. A flurry of three goals in less than two minutes in the second quarter extended the lead to 6-1. Two goals in a row by the Lancers cut the lead to 8-4 toward the end of the third quarter, but the Trojans scored the final five goals to close out the match.
The Trojans travel north next weekend for the NorCal Tournament, hosted by Stanford. The Trojans took home the tournament title last year with a 10-8 victory over UCLA in the final game.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Severe weather at MetLife Stadium on Saturday suspended the start of the second half between No. 2 USC and Syracuse by 69 minutes.
No sunshine · USC’s game against Syracuse on Saturday was stopped for nearly 70 minutes because of rain, wind and lightning. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The Trojans, leading 14-3 at halftime, came out of the locker room to warm up for the third quarter but were quickly ushered back as thunderstorms rumbled throughout the vicinity. A tornado warning had been in effect for the Tri-State area for most of the afternoon.
During the delay, stadium officials also forced spectators sitting in exposed seating areas to evacuate and find cover on the concourses as lightning hit the area.
The weather contributed to the strangeness of a game in which MetLife Stadium was filled to less than half-capacity and senior quarterback Matt Barkley threw for six touchdowns, but just 187 yards.
“It wasn’t an easy situation to come play in,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “That’s why, when NFL teams look at their schedule at the beginning of the year, they count their East Coast trips. Credit our players. They did a good job in a game that’s not really easy to play.”
Though he didn’t want to distract his team, Kiffin was informed of the likelihood of a delay before the game started. Barkley was the only player aware of the possibility after asking the officiating crew about the weather beforehand.
“The stadium [officials] did a great job,” Kiffin said. “They informed me — we didn’t tell our players — [the delay] was probably going to happen at some point during the game. ”
USC’s 35-26 victory against Ohio State at Ohio Stadium in 1990 was the last time before Saturday that the Trojans experienced a game delayed by thunderstorms.
Given the information in advance, Kiffin and his staff put a contingency plan in place.
“We knew what we were going to do,” Kiffin said. “We were going to take the pads off. We were going to go to dry shirts. We were really going to let our guys sit around and really coach our guys schematically and not waste a lot of energy.”
Barkley indicated that his team responded as well as could be expected.
“We don’t typically get delays from thunderstorms in Southern California,” Barkley said. “Our guys responded well, though. We came out in the second half and made some adjustments on offense and defense and made it right.”
Sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey, who snared two interceptions in the game, described the locker room atmosphere as calm but focused.
“It’s something we are not used to, but we handled it well,” Bailey said. “We came out hot in the second half.”
In retrospect, Kiffin said he was proud of his players for overcoming a set of circumstances that could have led to a lackadaisical, sloppy second half.
“They did a good job coming out with energy in the third quarter,” Kiffin said.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — If Saturday’s contest against Syracuse taught us anything, it’s this: Not even rain delays and thunderstorms can slow down USC’s dynamic passing attack.
Senior quarterback Matt Barkley failed to finish with his typical 300 passing yards, but he did manage to throw six touchdowns against the Orange. Three of those scoring tosses went to sophomore receiver Marqise Lee, while two went to junior receiver Robert Woods.
Though Lee might have stolen the spotlight in the season opener against Hawai’i with his 297 all-purpose yards, it was Woods’ show back east. And this, Trojan fans, is the best sign you could hope for.
I will say this: Robert Woods, I was a fool to think you would take a backseat to anybody.
Woods was unable to practice during the spring because of surgery on his injured right ankle, and even after he returned to practice, he sported a brace the size of a Mini Cooper.
Then the game against the Warriors happened. Woods was in single coverage the majority of the day, and though cornerbacks were holding him on a few occasions, he seemed just a little off. He wasn’t getting open. He was dropping passes. And strangest of all, he looked like a No. 2 receiver, with Lee being the star.
“He’ll be the best ever when it’s all said and done,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said of Lee afterward.
Was it finally Lee’s team? Some speculated that though Woods was the polished one, Lee was the explosive one who, as Kiffin suggested, could be the best receiver in school history. After the Hawai’i game, it hardly looked like an impossible prophecy.
But when Woods landed in Newark, N.J., and stepped onto the MetLife Stadium turf, the day belonged to him. Woods, donning his signature wry smile, could hardly be stopped.
He carved up the Syracuse defense in every  way imaginable: screens, deep sideline passes, slants. We saw the entire repertoire. But the main reason this apology is being written is because of his 76-yard run on a reverse in the fourth quarter.
He took the toss up the north sideline and was sprung forward by Marqise Lee’s block. Then, Woods showed why he is one of the best players in the country. He cut across the entire field, leaving several Syracuse players on the ground in the process, and raced down the south sideline before running out of gas near the end zone.
Those moves he made and the playmaking ability with the ball in his hands reminded us why Woods was a first-team All-American last season while breaking the Pac-12 mark for receptions in a single season.
It’s true that Lee is more of a burner than No. 2 is, and he is almost always open because of blinding speed. Even when Lee isn’t open, he’ll out-jump almost any cornerback in the country, as we saw on a pair of touchdown catches against Syracuse.
But Woods, polished as they come, and is a savvy veteran who just knows football. Sure-handed, he makes great adjustments on passes and runs to every open spot on the field. He just knows how to get open, no matter the circumstances.
Marqise Lee might be the future, but Woods is the present and, until proven otherwise, will continue to be the alpha dog of the USC receiving corps.
He isn’t always as fun to watch as Lee is, but when it comes down to it, there is no more reliable receiver in college football than Robert Woods. And for a team with national championship aspirations, a safety blanket for Barkley will be important in tight games.
In fact, if a game is close in the waning minutes, there is no other player I want catching passes other than Woods. That is no offense to Lee, a great player in his own right. But this is Woods’ receiving unit. He is the one who can get the ball when things look bleak and turn a 10-yard play into a long touchdown because of precision footwork — just like he did Saturday against the Orange.
So, I guess what I’m trying to say is this: I’m sorry, Robert.
I shouldn’t have doubted you. You taught us something, and it’s a lesson we won’t soon forget: Though USC boasts a pair of top receivers in its arsenal, Woods’ proverbial torch has not been passed.
And after Saturday’s contest, it’s clear he doesn’t want to give that up anytime soon.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Perhaps a weather delay was just what No. 2 USC needed in order to get its stagnant offense going.
In front of an announced crowd of 39,507, Syracuse held USC (2-0) to 71 yards in the first quarter, with Barkley throwing for just 27 passing yards. The Trojans also attempted three fourth-down conversions in the first, converting only one on a sweep by sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee.
No. 2 and No. 9 · For the second straight week, a USC wide receiver registered over 200 all-purpose yards. Junior Robert Woods ran wild against Syracuse, amassing 93 receiving yards and a 76-yard run. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“A lot of praise for [Syracuse],” Kiffin said. “This is a good team that we were coming to play today … Give those guys a lot of credit for playing really hard.”
But after Saturday’s 69-minute weather delay, the Trojans exploded for 28 points in the second half. Behind six touchdown passes, which tied his career high, senior quarterback Matt Barkley led the Trojans to a 42-29 win over Syracuse at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.
Though Lee shined brightest in the season opener against Hawai’i, junior wide receiver Robert Woods upstaged him against Syracuse, hauling in 10 receptions for 93 yards and adding a 76-yard run.
Kiffin also made reference to the fact that playing in an NFL stadium on the other side of the country made things difficult.
After a slow first quarter, USC’s luck turned in the second quarter when the senior signal caller hit sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee for a 13-yard touchdown. Barkley also found junior wide receiver Robert Woods down the sideline with a little more than a minute to go in the half. Barkley finished with 187 yards passing on 23 completions.
“[Barkley] played really well,” Kiffin said. “Once again, weird environment today, weather issues, wind issues, and I thought he took care of the ball really well.”
The Orange put their first points on the board as time expired in the half, and USC was leading 14-3 — but then the clouds came.
Fans were forced to stand inside the stadium while the players and coaches left the field for more than an hour as intense rain and storms passed overhead. During the delay, Barkley said the team was calm and relaxed.
“I put my feet up, put my headphones on,” Barkley said. “I took my pads off. I knew it was going to be longer than five or 10 minutes.”
After the delay, Barkley found Woods for a four-yard touchdown with 11:38 left in the third. With quarterback Ryan Nassib at the helm, Syracuse pulled to within five points after Barkley threw his first interception of the season.
Entering the fourth with the game close at 21-16, Barkley threw a touchdown to sophomore tight end Xavier Grimble, who bounced off four would-be tacklers to get into the end zone.
Through two games, the Heisman hopeful has thrown 10 touchdowns to only one interception. Barkley’s six scoring tosses Saturday matched USC’s single-game record and put him at a career total of 90 touchdowns — just nine shy of Matt Leinart’s school record.
Despite Barkley’s touchdowns, it was a Robert Woods run in the fourth quarter that got everyone in the stands on their feet.
Woods took a reverse up the left sideline and cut all the way across to the right before being tackled by a Syracuse player after a 76-yard gain.
“Coach Kiffin called a reverse, [we had] been practicing it the whole week,” Woods said. “[I] hit the edge — great block from Marqise [Lee] — two cuts, and I just tried to race down the sideline.”
He finished with 76 rushing yards, 93 yards receiving and a pair of touchdowns. Lee had 66 yards receiving and three touchdowns.
Barkley capped off his night with a scoring toss to Lee with 5:45 left in the game to put the game at 42-22. The Orange would score late to make the final tally 42-29.
The defense held up its end of the bargain Saturday night, forcing Nassib, the nation’s leading passer, to throw two interceptions, both of which were caught by sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey. Bailey took charge of the defense when the game got close and finished the game with eight tackles.
“I am one of the leaders of our defense,” Bailey said. “We huddled up and got the message across that we had to come up with a stop and put the ball back into our offense’s hands. We have one of the most explosive offenses in the country, and they exploded in the second half like we thought.”
The Trojans head back to the West Coast for next week’s game against Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif. on Sept. 15. The contest will be USC’s Pac-12 opener.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Astrobiology Institute announced last week that it will fund a center at USC for the first time.
During the next five years, a team of eight researchers will look at life in the Earth’s subsurface, micro-organisms that live in the ground, so that NASA might eventually use this project’s procedures on other planets and moons to determine if there is life outside Earth.
Jan Amend, a professor of earth and biological sciences, will lead the team of eight, including researchers from USC, CalTech, the Desert Research Institute and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Amend said the idea for researching life in the subsurface partially stems from other research going on at another USC center, the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations, funded by the National Science Foundation, which looks at life underneath the ocean floor. Also C-DEBI’s associate director, Amend said that researchers are just starting to understand subsurface life.
“It’s unlikely that we’ll find bunny rabbits running across the surface of Mars, or even bacteria or microbial life,” Amend said. “Any life we would find would be in subsurface, but the subsurface is incredibly difficult to work in.”
Research into subsurface life is relatively new — it started in the ’90s. Amend said learning about these micro-organisms, which are incredibly slow-moving and get their energy from non-solar sources like volcanic heat, can be difficult because they move and metabolize much more slowly than life on Earth’s surface.
“Organisms have the ability to grow at conditions that are much more extreme than we previously believed,” Amend said. “They can exist in places with a very low pH or a very high pH, places that have extremely high temperatures or low temperatures or even places with very high pressure.”
This versatility means that the kinds of life found in Earth’s subsurface are more likely to exist on other planets than the kinds of life found on Earth’s surface.
The research project intends to identify subsurface organisms, learn about how they get and use energy and determine their effects on the environment. In the long run, this will also help NASA figure out ways to measure subsurface life.
“We’re not planning on going into Earth and then immediately translating what we find to space missions,” Amend said. “Whatever we do find in the next five years may help us develop a Mars mission or find the best way to look at the subsurface of other planets.”
The tests will be done at several diverse sites around the western United States and one in the mid-Atlantic ridge. Several of the sites will be former boreholes or mines, but each site’s tested areas will have a very different temperature range, acidity, chemical composition and pressure. The rock, sediments and water samples will help the team paint a picture of life far underneath the ground.
The research project will also include an interactive media component from Holly Willis, the Institute for Multimedia Literacy’s director of academic programs. Willis will create a game aimed at middle schoolers, in which players, as micro-organisms, must make decisions about where to go, what to eat and how to survive in a harsh environment. The eight-person science team will provide realistic constraints, such as composition of rocks and water, temperature, radiation and pressure.
Amend said he and Kenneth Nealson, a professor of biological and earth sciences and director of the Wrigley Institute, spent long hours concocting the idea for the project over cups of coffee in LiteraTea last year.
After submitting the 179-page proposal in February, Amend said he assumed he wouldn’t get funded because so few projects do.
USC was one of five institutions to receive a five-year grant from the NAI. Of those five institutions, three were current centers renewing their grants. Thirty-seven of the proposals were for new projects.
“The odds are against you in a big way,” Amend said. “They’re incredible teams that are proposing projects … You’re competing against really powerful teams from schools with big names and big research departments.”
USC’s center is set to open Jan. 1 and to receive between $6 and $7 million from NASA, as well as some funding from USC. The NAI teams tend to have around 10 or 12 researchers and average an $8 million budget.
“It’s a great opportunity for students and postdocs to get into a pretty exciting field,” Amend said. “When these NASA centers are formed, they bring a lot of attention to exciting research. This is going to be great for USC.”
This is going to be huge for USC

Medical marijuana supporters collected 50,000 signatures to overturn a ban to shut down most of the medical marijuana storefront dispensaries in Los Angeles last Thursday.
Green doctors · Students for Sensible Drug Policy pushed against a potential ban on marijuana dispensaries, like this one in Venice Beach. – Lisa Parker | Daily Trojan
 
They submitted the petition to the City Clerk’s Office to call for a referendum on the March municipal election ballot, halting the ban from going into effect last Thursday. The City Attorney’s Office notified 1,046 suspected dispensary locations to shut down by the Sept. 6 deadline or face a fine when the ban was approved in July. Los Angeles city officials are not currently enforcing the ban because of their ongoing verification of the 50,000 signatures submitted on the petition.
When the council passed the ban in July, a total of 762 dispensaries were registered within the city of Los Angeles. The new regulation does not permit the sale of medical marijuana in stores but does allow licensed patients and caregivers to grow their own marijuana under the Compassionate Care Act.
Steven Hwang, a USC alumnus who majored in human performance, co-founded Students for Sensible Drug Policy in January to push for drug policy reform. He said his organization did not help with directly gathering signatures for the petition but helped spread information about the ban.
“It’s not a sensible policy whatsoever,” Hwang said. “We always want to ease patient access. We always want to provide them with the best quality for them to enjoy and medicate on their own from the safety of their homes. This ban is really out of touch with what the citizens are asking for.”
If the petition to eliminate the ban is verified, the L.A. City Council will decide whether to repeal the ordinance, call for a special election within the next 140 days or put it on the ballot March 5.
Sarah Lovering, development officer for the Marijuana Policy Project, said the ban will likely be overturned. She is also unsure, however, what it will mean for medical marijuana policy overall as the ban also bars the city from enforcing a 2010 ordinance to regulate dispensaries.
“If the ban is repealed, then I guess we go to a situation where there is no ordinance, which could be good for patients,” she said. “It means that patients will be able to shop at dispensaries. But dispensary owners will be at risk because there won’t be any clear guidelines about who’s allowed to operate and where.”
She said the alternative to dispensaries is generally the black market, where there is no guarantee of quality or consistency of the product.
“The benefits [of dispensaries] are things like patients who need medical marijuana will be able to find it much more easily and be able to have a lot more in its quality,” she said. “A lot of dispensaries do test their products and even those who don’t … it would be very easy to tell others about that and report it.”
Junior business major Cynthia Bardon said she supports the use of medical marijuana but sees potential dangers in a lack of regulation.
“There should be more control to avoid illegal trafficking,” Bardon said. “If people are going to try to obtain it illegally through street vendors, it will be more dangerous.”
Hwang said part of the initial goal of SSDP was to put a legalization initiative on the November ballot. Though there is no initiative on the ballot, Hwang said that SSDP will continue working for new policies.
“We’re going to be rallying everyone to overturn this ban in March and elect more officials who have more sensible policies,” he said. “This ban … really makes no sense on how we can continue to ease access for the patients instead of putting up barriers and putting our patients in very dangerous situations.”

Video testimonies of genocide survivors in the USC Shoah Foundation’s digital archives are now being used for educational purposes by institutions of higher learning worldwide. Shoah also now offers tours of the facilities to enhance the learning experience.
The foundation is located on the first floor of Leavey Library. The next public tour is scheduled for Tuesday at 10 a.m.
The foundation was founded in 1994 by film director Steven Spielberg. Krystal Szabo, Shoah Foundation coordinator of external relations, said while he was working on Schindler’s List, Spielberg recognized a need to document the testimonies of Holocaust survivors and allow them to articulate their experiences.
Currently, the foundation has more than 52,000 video testimonies in its archives, with an average length of 2 hours. Though most of the testimonies are from Holocaust survivors, there are also testimonies from those who have survived the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda, the Armenian genocide and the Cambodian genocide, Szabo said. The foundation’s archive includes testimonies from 56 countries in 32 languages and is the largest of its kind in the world.
Anne Marie Stein, Shoah Foundation director of communications, said that the focus of the foundation is currently shifting from collecting testimonies to using the testimonies already gathered for educational purposes.
“There are over 70 classes at USC alone that integrate the testimonies into their curriculum,” Stein said.
Szabo affirmed this expansion of the foundation’s mission and said the shift was the reason the name of the foundation was changed from the “Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation” to the “USC Shoah Foundation —The Institute for Visual History and Education.”
“Today the institute strives to understand and share the insights contained with the Visual History Archive via a multitude of programs with educators, students, researchers and scholars on every continent,” Szabo said.
Making the thousands of digital testimonies in the Visual History Archive easier to navigate, as well as launching new educational programs that use the testimonies, has been a major focus of the foundation.
Among these programs are IWitness, which gives secondary school teachers and students access to more than 1,000 testimonies of Holocaust survivors and witnesses, and Echoes and Reflection, a Holocaust curriculum designed to help students understand the Holocaust and their own life stories in a personal way.
Allowing the Visual History Archive to be used in the development of curriculum at various academic institutions remains a priority for the Shoah Foundation. Currently more than 300 courses in 25 disciplines at 35 universities draw from the foundation’s archive of testimonies, Stein said.
One of these courses is IML 340, “The Praxis of New Media: Digital Argument,” at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Taught by Professor DJ Johnson, the course gives students the opportunity to take excerpts from the testimonials in the Visual History Archive and create their own short films or “digital arguments.”
“This class is very much like directed research projects,” Johnson said. “Our goal is to contemporize issues like the Holocaust and show how history and memory have been reshaped by testimony.”
Chris Rowe, a senior majoring in writing for screen and television, said that his experience in IML 340 was a profound, personal one.
“We were required to incorporate personal narrative with the testimonies we saw,” Rowe said. “I wanted my work to express how the testimonies really invaded the space in which I lived.”
Maddie Renov, a senior majoring in communication, said that working on her digital argument as part of the class and watching the testimonials from the Visual History Archive transformed her understanding of the Holocaust.
“I’ve been learning about the Holocaust my whole life, but being able to experience the testimonies is completely different,” Renov said. “The three women I featured had stories that really spoke to me. I felt like I knew them.”
Even students who haven’t been exposed to the foundation through class recognize the importance and significance of the archives.
“This is the only foundation I know of that does something like this, and I’m glad USC is a part of it,” said Freddie Archer, a freshman majoring in communication. “We definitely can’t forget such an important part of history.”
Katina Mitchell, a graduate student studying early music performance, had not heard of the foundation before but said it was something she would be interested in learning more about.
“It seems like a really great resource for research,” she said.
In addition to making the Visual History Archive available to schools and educational institutions, the Shoah Foundation began giving public tours of the institute last July. Monthly tours are free and open to the public and allow guests to explore the testimonies in the archive.

USC announced a $35 million renovation to Heritage Hall last Thursday as part of its $300 million Heritage Initiative.
Initiative · The $35 million renovation to Heritage Hall could attract more recruits, as well as improve the facilities for current student athletes. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
 
The initiative was announced in late August in order to “provide the best athletic and academic facilities for the nation’s best collegiate athletes,” according to USC Athletics’ website. The initiative will be co-chaired by former football coach John Robinson and Barbara Hedges, who helped create the USC women’s athletics program while serving as a Trojan athletics administrator.
The groundbreaking for the $35 million facelift to Heritage Hall is slated for January 2013, according to the website.
The renovations will only redesign some 80,000 square feet of the interior of Heritage Hall, Senior Associate Athletic Director Mark Jackson said.
“This will be a period of transition for student athletes and staff, but it shouldn’t affect how we practice,” Jackson said.
Caesar Aguilar, a student manager of the football team, said the renovations are much-needed and could even attract more recruits.
“The renovations to Heritage Hall have been much-awaited,” Aguilar said. “Some of the football players used to say to me that they were grossed out by the stains on the floor when they walked through. I think that the renovations will encourage recruits to come to USC, because Heritage needs the upgrade. It’s a huge reason a lot of football players choose another school.”
Another feature of the Heritage Initiative is the construction of a new aquatics center, partially funded by former USC swim team captain Fred Uytengsu. The center will house a new diving dry-land training area, dive tower and locker and team meeting rooms. It will also include coaches’ offices, a multi-purpose room, a larger stadium and a new scoreboard with video visuals, according to the website.
Upgrades to Marks Tennis Stadium and the construction of a sand volleyball court, as well as the completion of suites at the Galen Center are also part of the initiative.
Jake Balentine, a freshman majoring in computer science, said he believes the improvements will work to bolster USC’s athletic standing.
“After the Olympics, our reputation of athletics went up more, and along with our historical presence in the Olympics, our renovations just add to the reputation we have,” he said.

The wait is over: The Book of Mormon is here.
With an astounding 14 2011 Tony nominations and 9 wins, including for best musical, best direction and best book, and a trail of sold out shows from New York City to Denver, the national tour of The Book of Mormon is making its stop in Los Angeles at the Pantages Theatre, open now until Nov. 25.

Jared Gertner, who acted as a standby for lead actor Josh Gad and eventually overtook the role on Broadway, steps into the role of Elder Cunningham but not without an honest appreciation of the transition.
“You never really know when you’re a standby — you’re jumping into someone else’s shoes hoping that you don’t rock the boat too much, but can still make it your own,” Gertner said. “When they offered me the opportunity to take over the role on Broadway and come do the tour it felt like total validation, like they were happy with what I’d done.”
Gad, who originally played the role and was nominated for the best performance Tony for his work, serves as inspiration for Gertner as he embarks on making the role uniquely his own on the tour.
“Josh is this unbelievable genius comedian and when he created the role, it was so distinctly him, and he has his own individual brand of comedy,” Gertner said. “I knew very quickly that I would never try to imitate that, because I would fail.”
In shifting from Broadway to the national tour platform, Gertner notices and appreciates the opportunity to get to know different areas of the country and see how people respond differently to the comedic aspects of the show. He calls it a “sociological experiment” since the process gives him a creative challenge.
“With a show like this that’s so funny, the audience plays a major part in the experience of the show,” Gertner said. “So the way they respond to things changes how we experience the show and, ultimately, how we do the show.”
When talking about his start with Mormon, Gertner remembers the passion from the production team. A collaboration of South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone as well as Robert Lopez of Avenue Q, the show was a long time coming for Gertner — he grew up with South Park and boasts Avenue Q as one of his favorite musicals.
“I just wanted to get in the room, and so I auditioned,” he said. “When I got it, I felt so lucky because I got to watch the most brilliant people creating this mega-hit musical and eventually step in and do it. In the beginning I just learned so much by watching these people work.”
The hype following the show around the country has a surprising effect on how audiences have perceived the musical. The affiliation with Trey Parker and Matt Stone — coupled with the shock-factor of openly mocking religion — has led critics to describe the show as “lewd,” “crude” and “blasphemous.” To that, Gertner issues a challenge.
“I just don’t think it’s all that controversial,” he said. “I challenge people who think they’re going to be offended to watch the whole show all the way through and see what we’re actually trying to say. Because it’s not just funny or offensive, it’s kind of beautiful.”
The Book of Mormon represents a paradigm shift in musical theater that is bringing in a different crowd: audiences of all ages, races and genders.
“Matt and Trey’s involvement has certainly brought in a newer audience,” Gertner said. “People that don’t necessarily want to go to musicals, but want to come see their musical.”
With The Book of Mormon’s nearly sold out shows throughout its stay here in Los Angeles, tickets to the show aren’t exactly a dime a dozen. What Gertner appreciates about Mormon audiences, though, isn’t that they’re willing to pay through the roof for tickets — it’s that even with the waiting and the expense, audiences are genuinely excited for the experience.
“People are coming in so excited for us and it’s like they’ve been waiting a year for us to arrive here … and they’re ready to party,” Gertner said. “That’s the most exciting thing, bringing this show to the country, full of people who couldn’t wait for us to get there. That is a real honor.”
This show is apparently the crudest, most expletive-ridden and blasphemous production ever offered on Broadway.  If that does not discourage you from attending, consider that it mercilessly  lampoons and outrageously dishonors the religion of over 14 million people worldwide.  You may not be a believer, but I hope that if you are a decent person you will not support and approve such smut and slander by your attendance.
SandeeM:  You just convinced me to go.  If you’re that offended, then it MUST be good.

There is a delicate art to passing a class while putting in the bare minimum effort. This isn’t necessarily borne out of laziness, but sometimes our schedules are just too full and there are other priorities besides required classes or general education.
Not every course you take will catch your interest, but for the sake of grade point averages and parental wrath, there’s still an obligation to do well. A common question asked by students at the beginning of every year is, “How much work do I actually have to do in order to get by?”
This doesn’t mean you’re a bad student, it’s merely a desire to make the most out of your time here — there is, after all, more to college than just going to class.
Certain practices, however, must be avoided so that you don’t seem like a student who doesn’t care, because hopefully that’s not the case.
Despite popular belief, sitting in the back row does not make you any less noticeable to those in charge. In a way, you’re drawing just as much attention to yourself as those who promptly sit in the front of the class, backs straight and eyes wide open.
The prime real estate of a normal classroom is right in the middle. This area allows for flexibility depending on your mood that day. If you have something you’d like to contribute to class, sit within the professor’s line of vision. But if you’re not feeling active, there are also the sides of the middle rows, which are easy to overlook from the head of the classroom — perfect for when you’ve had a rough night or you’re “just not feelin’ it.”
Participation is also a tricky subject. When you’re looking to merely skate by, chances are you’re probably not up to date with every reading assignment. No worries — all you have to do is pick a section, analyze it carefully and be prepared to offer an ambiguous yet thought-provoking observation. Questions are even better because they’ll make it sound like you actually gave the text some consideration.
Now, for one of the biggest concerns when attending a class that you have little interest in: falling asleep. We’ve all experienced that terrifying moment when your eyes droop, the drool drips and your elbow slips. Suddenly you’re jerked awake right before you hit the desk face-first.
Falling asleep in class is seriously dangerous business. Besides the obvious risk of incurring the red-penned wrath of professors on your future assignments, dozing off could lead to sleep talk, useless notes, a possible concussion and — worst of all — snoring.
Finding ways to occupy your mind and body ensures maximum attention and prevents a narcoleptic disaster.
Doodling creates a tried and true method of at least staying occupied enough to not fall asleep. You can attempt to use your phone or laptop for texting or games, but this is the rudest option. Professors of a prestigious university deserve more respect than that.
Try writing down humorous quotes from your professor if he or she is of the quirky variety, or practice your writing skills by drafting a hand-written letter. You can also eye that cute classmate who caught your interest on the first day. Optical footsie presents an interesting way to make sure you aren’t tempted to retreat into a deep slumber.
For the studious kids out there, participating in class is also a viable option. Believe it or not, raising your hand and contributing to the discussions at hand will keep you awake and cause you to learn a thing or two. By making a conscious effort to engage yourself with the course, you might actually discover that it’s not so bad.
Speaking in class isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, though, and a simple solution to this is to jot down your own questions on a notepad and then speak to the professor during office hours.
As for attendance, though your dedication might be questionable, avoid skipping unless it’s absolutely necessary. Being absent will only draw attention to yourself, and if your efforts have been less-than-satisfactory, this attention will definitely be unwanted.
Also, don’t show up late. It’s impolite and, again, will only earn you negative attention.
Though you might not be invested in a class, it doesn’t mean you can’t fake it till you make it. I mean, let’s be real here. I wrote this column slightly before my deadline. Pretty good though, eh? Just follow my example and you’ll be flying by with little to no effort.
 
Nick Cimarusti is a junior majoring in English and Spanish. His column “Get Schooled” runs Mondays.
This is pure, factory-created excellence.
And…there’s still something to be said about leaving an apple for the teacher…or, maybe now a hefty Starbucks card in a colorful envelope as a token of your “appreciation”.  Is that kissing up? Of course it is. Get used to it.

The modern-Victorian wallpaper at The Parish, executive chef Casey Lane’s new Downtown gastropub, might cause you to have flashbacks of your grandmother’s living room. Then again, Grandma didn’t play the Wu-Tang Clan during dinner.
[Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Casey Lane was a former chef at the Tasting Kitchen. Lane is currently the executive chef at the Tasting Kitchen and The Parish.]
Buttermilk bliss · Smoky peaches and juicy tomatoes enhance fried buttermilk chicken, just one of many of The Parish’s delicious dishes. – Bernard Leed | Daily Trojan
The discordant atmosphere plays off the quirkiness of the menu, which can be described as comfort food with a kick. Deviled eggs arrive with Indian spices topping the fluffy swirls of yolk. These are two-bite deviled eggs, and the second of the two bites should mop up the warm, paprika-like sauce on the plate.
Cherubic breakfast radishes — pink and chubby, long green stems still attached — arrive with an equally chubby sphere of butter, thick squares of salt and pepper on top. Cute as they may be, their flavor bites back.
These small plates possess just a hint of edge, as they should at any Spring Street restaurant worth its weight in fried chickpeas and craft cocktails.
Those chickpeas, paired in a silver bowl with fried olives, elevate the ubiquitous bar-menu options of Downtown. The olives are — there’s no other word — transcendent. As you pop them like savory, briny Gushers, you’ll wish you had another bowl on the way.
Daal Mahkani, an Indian lentil dish, exemplifies the British-Indian fusion at which Lane excels. A bowl of spicy, starchy lentils, in their own thick broth, tastes familiar without being boring. Credit must also go to the slab of toast, generously slicked with cherry chutney. wedged into the lentils.
Porter sausage atop parsnip puree brings the meal into more traditionally British territory, a sort of variation on the pub favorite bangers and mash. A perfectly cooked and delightfully fatty sausage patty leans against the sweet puree, and the addition of pickled cherries takes the dish to new heights. As with those sidekick fried olives, cherries prepared any other way suddenly seem unimportant.
Fish and chips — which should arrive in a paper cone, but doesn’t — is a mixed bag. The tender, buttery fish is technically perfect, but set atop flavorless slices of spud, the combination falls flat. Pairing these fried morsels, though, with a tiny dice of vinegary geleé is a pleasant and unusual way to accent the fish. And the Johnny Cash and Cold War Kids playing through the sound system will still keep a smile on your face.
Still, any British pub incapable of knocking “chips” out of the park needs to rethink the dish they are serving.
A pile of fried chicken is a true success story, though, crunchy and peppery as fried chicken should be. But what even the best coating often lacks is a means of sticking to the poultry once bitten or cut. This is not an issue here, however, with the juicy meat and a sticky currant vinaigrette keeping it all intact.
But, again, there is an underdog that steals the spotlight: sliced peaches with smoky juices that wash down heavy bites of chicken. You won’t be able to get these peaches off of your mind.
Dessert might be sticky toffee pudding, a more loyal and tasty adaptation of a British staple than those fish and chips — a dense, syrupy cake redolent of burnt sugar with thick cream and plum slices floating beside it.
For an Indian dessert, one could do worse than the Indian fried dough balls known as gulab jamun. They come soaked in a honey-sweet sauce of rose water, with bits of apple and pistachio adding crunch.
When your waitress arrives with dessert menus, quite possibly to the sounds of Ray Charles belting “I’ve Got a Woman,” order both the “pudding” and the dough balls. Like the gold digger of Charles’ song, it’ll be easy to justify your greediness.
And, giving in to greed once more, here’s a request to Lane and company: a dish consisting only of smoky peaches, pickled cherries and fried olives. Please. The combination, after all, is as improbably perfect as the Parish’s music and decor.
I actually remember going there…. it was pretty good, I guess it couldn’t be British if the food was a 10 out of 10… it reminded me of  WD 50 in NYC  actually…

For the kind of person who doesn’t mind curling up with Faulkner instead of going out on a Friday night, The Words creates an intriguing world of complex themes and heartbreaking characters that deserve careful analysis.
But for everyone else, the film might seem like a bit of a literary snoozer.
The Words, which opened Sept. 7 to decidedly negative reviews, doesn’t have much in the way of plot. Starring Bradley Cooper and Zoë Saldana as Rory and Dora Jansen, a pair of college sweethearts in the early years of marriage, the film toys with questions of guilt and love and discusses the boundaries of fiction and reality.
Rory, a young writer struggling to get his first book published, discovers a manuscript from the 1940s and decides to pass off the work as his own — an act that leads to his immediate celebrity status in the literary world. When an old man (Jeremy Irons) approaches Rory and claims to be the author of the stolen manuscript, Rory must deal with his own increasing guilt and the loss of what he values most: his wife and his self-respect.
Outside of this emotionally driven narrative is the story of the older, bestselling author Clay Hammond, whom the audience soon discovers is reading the story of Rory and Dora from his own novel The Words. When Daniella (Olivia Wilde), an intellectual with a sensual streak, approaches Hammond with curiosities about his new book, he comes to grips with a dark past similar to that of his character’s. With the layered plot revolving around three major characters — Rory, the old man and Clay — the film takes the idea of “a story within a story” to a whole new level.
The problem lies not in the film’s incorporation of three major storylines but in the lengthy exposition given to each. Instead of taking an approach akin to that of L.A. Confidential or Crazy, Stupid, Love, in which pieces of each character’s story are slowly revealed as the films progress, The Words lumps its plot into three large segments; the audience first witnesses Rory’s story, then the old man’s, then Clay’s, a belabored technique which slows the pace of the film.
The film also fails to answer all of the questions it poses. Though there’s nothing wrong with incorporating heavy themes into a film, The Words gets bogged down in them. Among the film’s many topics are the necessity of suffering for art, the importance of valuing loved ones and the life-long consequences of our mistakes — heady topics that, while intriguing, seem cramped in a 96-minute film with so little action. Just as Rory struggles with the moral implications of stealing another man’s work, the audience is forced to carefully weigh each theme in order to gain anything from the film.
And when The Words attempts to leave audiences guessing with its ambiguous ending, it’s hard to muster up enough energy to care.
Still, The Words is not without its high points. The film is ripe with stunning performances from each of its principal actors.
Cooper tugs at audiences’ heartstrings with his ability to create a character that is alternately loveable and pitiable. As Rory switches from happily adoring his wife to painfully seeking forgiveness from her and the old man, Cooper delivers a character who is believable, demonstrating that he has talent outside of his crass Hangover persona.
Saldana, with her emotive facial expressions and on-screen charisma, perfectly embodies the role of the supportive homebody taken for granted. And though Quaid doesn’t occupy much screen time, his portrayal of Clay is appropriately tortured and cynical.
In addition, The Word’s incorporation of beautiful European scenery and detailed apartments make the film pleasant to watch. As the couple wanders through the streets of Paris on their honeymoon, the viewer gets a glimpse into a world of cobblestoned streets and cozy bookshops full of relics from the past.
Rory and Dora’s cozy New York City apartment is both charming and bohemian with bright colors and handmade gadgets that hint at the couple’s financial distress. Conversely, Clay’s apartment is distinctively cold and colorless, full of unpacked boxes and glaringly empty white walls.
The imagery in The Words, underscored by Marcelo Zarvos’ romantic orchestral score, at least makes the film easy on the eyes and ears.
The Words also has a way with language. The elegant writing of the film’s fictional novels leaves little question as to whether these characters are good writers, and the tense dialogue exchanged between Dora and Rory and between Daniella and Clay is both appropriate and relatable. And with Quaid as Clay narrating the events of the story, the film refreshingly combines standard voiceover with literary prose.
Ultimately when Hammond reads, “He had been confronted by everything he had aspired to be and by everything he would never become,” the audience can’t help but agree.
Much like Rory, The Words unfortunately doesn’t live up to its potential.

End racial profiling
The term racial profiling includes targeting individuals based on their actual or perceived race, ethnicity, religion, national origin or immigration or citizenship status. The practice stems from the misconception that certain groups are more likely to be involved in criminal activity, identified solely by their appearance.
The United States has a history of racial discrimination that continues unchecked through the use of racial profiling, from African-Americans being stopped because their presence is “suspicious,” to the profiling of individuals of Middle Eastern appearance, often near airports. Currently there is no federal law in place to protect people from racial profiling.
This form of institutionalized discrimination infringes upon the lives of many Americans and creates a distrust of law enforcement within communities.
On a personal level, it is important to be aware of facts, as opposed to socially constructed stereotypes. On a more formal level, contact your state senators and local Representative and urge them to cosponsor the End Racial Profiling Act of 2011 (S. 1670 and H.R. 3618, respectively).
The proposed legislation prohibits law enforcement agents or agencies from engaging in racial profiling and grants the United States or an individual injured by racial profiling the right to obtain declaratory or injunctive relief. This bill requires agencies that apply for federal grants to certify that they maintain adequate policies for eliminating racial profiling. The act provides funds to educate law enforcement agents on racial profiling issues, and for data collection measures to monitor the implantation of the bill.

Open letter to USC students
 
This letter is in response to the “party behavior,” i.e. out-of-control screaming and roaming the streets while drunk on Labor Day Weekend.
Students: What has happened to you?  We, who are your neighbors, we, who share your living spaces, grocery stores, restaurants, parking lots, streets and sidewalks cannot understand why you have become examples of the most disgusting trailer trash we have ever seen.
When did your parents teach you that urinating in public on private lawns and having sexual intercourse in private backyards was acceptable behavior?  From what recesses of your Neanderthal minds did you dredge up the idea that roaming the streets in packs, yelling and screaming at each other at 1 a.m. was a mark of person on their way to becoming a part of the greater business, intellectual or cultural community?
We are saddened by whatever calamity may have befallen you, and we are amazed that you have chosen to respond to it by embracing behavior that is both gross and repellant to most civilized persons. We even pity your fellow students who have to live with you and see you every day on campus and in classrooms.
USC has gone to great lengths to ensure your safety, meeting with landlords and homeowners in the USC area, asking for our help in protecting you from predatory individuals.  They did not, unfortunately, tell us how we can protect ourselves from you.  We do not want to think of USC students as hostile invaders trampling our civil and personal rights.  But, you may yet persuade us that you are indeed not to be tolerated.
We, as permanent residents of this area are not leaving, and we will not put up with rude, crude, drunken bums careening around our neighborhoods. We live here, we pay taxes and we have LAPD and DPS in our smart phones.  It is time for some serious behavior modification on the part of students who seem unable to differentiate between getting an education and alcohol-fueled, swinish behavior.
Shelley Adler
Resident of North University Park
@ Fact Check:
North University Park is a legally defined Planning area North of campus. It is defined as 30th Street to Adams Blvd. and Vermont to Hoover.  West of campus is a different neighborhood. For decades USC students would not live West of campus because it was considered unsafe. That attitude encouraged a concentration of USC students in North University Park and the consequent displacement of working people in rental units. There are almost none left.
Within the past few years as USC has grown and the need for student housing has expanded, students are beginning to move into areas West of campus. As a neighborhood in transition there may be some resentment to this. However, North University Park has already changed. It is now almost all campus serving student housing. In recognition of this fact the City of Los Angeles has enacted NSO ordinance number 180218. The NSO (Neighborhood Stabilization Ordinance) addresses the impact of parking in campus serving housing areas. These are facts that can be verified, not mere speculation and opinion. 
Thank you at least for recognizing that the word “Ghetto” is perjorative and inappropriate.
@ Jack
Well. I see it in print again. The “G” word: You called the North University Park area a “Ghetto”. I have known for decades that that is how USC students see us. Perhaps that accounts for the rude behavior and alcohol fueled parties. After all, decent standards don’t apply in the Ghetto, do they?
Your calumnious assertion that criminal offenders mentioned in the D T’s roundup section actually live in North University Park are based on speculation, not fact.. I don’t see them in the ‘hood. All of my neighbors are USC students. Your opinions are not facts. USC students have indeed displaced the working class element of North University Park. And they are not coming back. Rents are too high.
And yes, year round North University Park permanent residents are also occasionally victims of crime. But we don’t blame our neighbors. We know that criminals come from far afield to prey on the easy pickings of unaware (and sometimes drunk) USC students.  Wise up!
Although I disagree with Jack’s use of the word ‘ghetto’ (unfortunately among students it seems to have become a synonym for a working class neighborhood), your response is ridiculous.
The criminals who affect students’ lives daily aren’t local residents?  Even criminals have to live somewhere.  I could use the same logic to claim that your assertion that USC students have been loud and disruptive is mere speculation.  Perhaps they are imposters from UCLA.
Your claim that you have no working class neighbors is also either a deliberate lie, or a simple gap in your knowledge, similar to your outdated assumptions about USC’s alcohol policy.  Even if the residents who live near you are primarily students, the University area as a whole is still dominated by working class folk.  One need only walk west of campus to realize this.
Yes, by definition, opinions are not facts.  But facts are facts.  And these are the facts.
“Working people no longer have a foothold in this area so your information and biases are out of date.”   ‘North University Park’, the “working class people” you’re talking about certainly still have a foothold in this area–as University Park so astutely pointed out, “I think that USC students find it similarly disruptive that 300 or 400 of your fellow residents have the annoying habit of stealing our bikes, breaking into our residences, snatching our cell phones, sexually assaulting us, (all of which occupy the Daily Trojan’s Roundup section at least weekly) and occasionally shooting us.”
Shelley, you’re a disgrace. USC makes this decrepit ghetto a much better place to live for everyone around us, and the least you could do is show some gratitude. Sure, we drink–we’re college students, it’s what college students do. Our drinking is far less problematic than your community’s rampant criminality, theft, and violence.
@ Fact Check:
FYI :
I don’t have any lower income neighbors, unless you mean the students. I used to but the working class neighbors  have all been displaced by student housing. Ignoring and circumventing L A’s rent control ordinances, all the so called lower income residents have been displaced by greedy developers who can rent the same units to students at triple the rate. Working people no longer have a foothold in this area so your information and biases are out of date.
I take no pleasure in other’s suffering and I have not opined on whether USC is a nuisance or blessing to the community. However, facts are facts. The lack of available street parking affects everyone, All residents and visitors jockey for position for limited free street parking spots. 
The current trend is to convert 2 BR 4 plexes into 4 BR 4 plexes without providing any extra off street parking. So where once there had been a need for 8 (at a minumum) parking spaces there is now a need for 16. Free street parking also benefits USC Commuter students who avoid paying a premium for sky high USC parking structure fees.
You are right about one thing. I may have been out of date about the ROW alcohol policy. That was once the case.
But the cat is out of the bag. Alcohol fueled revelries in North University Park are out of control and USC and DPS turn a blind eye to them.
There is no ban on alcohol on the Row!  Please, you people are so stupid it is scary….
To “University Park:”
I had to cringe a little when I read that “opening your driveways and charging $20” was seen as a community benefit. Think about it. That means that no other street parking is available because it is all taken up by game fans parking for free. For years year round residents have had to plan their own events around game day schedules. It is not much better on non game days. One can’t even have a dinner party any more because there is no place for guests to park.
The real problem is USC’s hypocritical attitude regarding alcohol. When USC banned alcohol on the row decades ago the fraternities simply moved their alchohol fuled revelries into the surrounding community and the USC administration turned a blind eye. No alcohol on the row, problem solved. Now the practice is so entrenced that it is impossible to change it.
I would like to see alcohol back on the row and out of the community.
I think many of your lower-income neighbors would disagree with your point that being able to charge $20 per car on gameday is not a benefit to them.
All California residents pay taxes that contribute to the maintenance of public streets, and as such, have the right to park on them where legal.  Residents with houses on particular streets have no special privileges there.  Maybe it sounds unfair to you, but it’s the way it is.  You have the same right to park on streets adjacent to student apartments if you wish, and then watch them struggle to find parking near their residences.  Perhaps their suffering would bring you peace.
I have to point out, though, that unlike many of your neighbors, you seem more concerned about having dinner parties than having dinner, so you might not be the best community representative to speak to whether USC is a nuisance or blessing to the community.  The $400 million in economic output per year to the local community that otherwise wouldn’t be there is hard to argue with.
To clarify your point about alcohol on the row, it is not banned there.  I’m not sure where you’re getting your information.
Shelley: please stop acting as if your proximity to USC provides you nothing but hardship.
In fact, your proximity to USC increases the value of your property, provides you with an increased level of security (as you said, DPS is ‘in your smart phone’), and serves as an economic boon for the surrounding area.
USC students patronize local small businesses and participate in community service projects to help improve the lives of local citizens.  The Joint Educational Project, for example, allows USC students to provide academic help to students in local schools.
Students, too, pay taxes (sales tax is 8.75%) and provide LAPD with a preying ground to collect fines for minor infractions such as riding bikes through intersections.  This money flows back into the surrounding community to fund public works projects and other services.
It is because USC is here that residents in the surrounding area can open up their driveways on gamedays and charge $20 per car for parking.
Without USC students in your area, you would not have DPS in your smart phone, because DPS would not be in your area either.  And without DPS’s ever-watchful eye, you’d likely have much more serious and annoying issues than a small subset of USC’s 37,000 students acting inconsiderately every once in a while.
Before characterizing USC students as ‘swinish’ and ‘disgusting trailer trash,’ perhaps you should consider whether you would rather live in this area without USC’s presence.  If we really are swine, then swine have been getting a bad rap.
Nobody is trying to excuse the inappropriate behavior of tens of our tens of thousands of students, but USC certainly provides more benefits to its surrounding community than drawbacks.  Hopefully this is a fact that you recognize.
Shelley, on behalf of my fellow students, I apologize for any inconveniences we may occasionally cause you and other local residents.  We look forward to continuing to make University Park a better place to live through our affiliation with USC, which has been proud to call South Los Angeles home since its founding in 1880.
I am so glad to find that there are some USC students (such as you) who actually take pride in responsible behavior and are put on the defensive when it is pointed out that some of your co-students do not live up to the standards that are usually integral to any civilized society.  
Whether or not the area is better or worse off because of USC has been debated for years.
Regardless of the answer to that question, the drunken and disruptive behavior of about 300 or 400 your fellow students in a residential neighborhood was unacceptable by any standard that propounds that everyone benefits if we all have some consideration for the needs of others.  Public drunkenness and disorderly conduct are not condoned; they are, in fact, illegal.  Even you do not condone it…since you apologized on behalf of your fellow students.  We would love to have USC students make this a more pleasant neighborhood.  You may well be a student who could help do that and I hope that you will.
I think that USC students find it similarly disruptive that 300 or 400 of your fellow residents have the annoying habit of stealing our bikes, breaking into our residences, snatching our cell phones, sexually assaulting us, (all of which occupy the Daily Trojan’s Roundup section at least weekly) and occasionally shooting us.  These types of behaviors, like disorderly conduct, have no place in civilized society.
Yet, no USC students are writing open letters to all local residents, blaming them for this ‘swinish’ behavior.  We do not claim that all local residents have ‘Neanderthal minds.’  We understand that this kind of behavior is limited to a minuscule subset of the surrounding community, and does not represent the community as a whole.
This is the root of my frustration about your letter.  You do not give USC students the same courtesy.
I can’t believe that you would even suggest that there is a legitimate debate regarding whether the community is better or worse because of USC’s presence.  The facts speak for themselves.
The rowdy behavior has been observed and documented for years. Unfortunately, despite USC administration assurances, it is not getting any better.
When they banned alcohol on the Row and the alcohol fueled parties moved into the neighborhood, that’s when it started.

Two stories have dominated the news cycle over the last couple months: the upcoming presidential election and multiple shocking instances of gun violence.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
The mass shooting in an Aurora, Colo. movie theater in July, the murder of Sikhs in a Wisconsin temple in August and the shooting at the Empire State Building a few weeks ago have rendered the fight over the Second Amendment one of the most important civil liberties struggles of our generation.
Though these recent gun-related instances of violence were nothing short of appalling, our shock — personally and nationally over what seems to be an increase in mass shootings — must not cloud our understanding of the importance that the right to bear arms holds in our free society.
Rather than restricting access to firearms for everyone, we need to remind policymakers that we will not allow the inexcusable actions of a few crazed and evil individuals to curb upstanding citizens’ constitutional right to protect themselves. In fact, what these events should make clear to us is that these rights must extend outside of the home so that law-abiding citizens can protect themselves in public — should any similar events happen in the future.
The passage of the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011 (H.R. 822) in the House of Representatives last November constituted a step in the right direction. If passed in the Senate, the bill would allow non-resident citizens with valid concealed carry permits issued by their home states to carry their weapon in other states where concealed carry is legal, essentially streamlining concealed carry standards nationwide and allowing qualified citizens to defend themselves more easily.
Unfortunately, it is unlikely to pass in the Senate, especially in light of the recent tragedies.
According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, about 70 percent of all homicides throughout the United States in 2007 were committed with a firearm. Gun control advocates constantly cite disturbing statistics such as this figure, but what they fail to consider is how much lower this number could have been had more victims and bystanders had a weapon to protect themselves.
According to the FBI’s Annual Uniform Crime Report, states that widely allow concealed carry — “right-to-carry” states — have 22 percent lower total violent crime rates and 30 percent lower homicide rates than the country as a whole. Evidently, the presence of law-abiding citizens who carry firearms can serve as a significant deterrent to violent crime.
Passing laws restricting access to guns will do nothing to stop the violence perpetrated by the James Holmeses of the world. Criminals commit reprehensible, illegal acts exactly because they have no respect for the law.
Why would they have any more respect for stricter gun laws? If the prohibition of drugs has not reduced drug use and drug-related violence, what reason is there to believe that the prohibition of guns will stop criminals from getting and doing what they want?
This is not to say that anyone should be able to buy guns from their local street corner. Detailed background checks should continue to be regularly conducted upon any and every gun purchase. But there should also be a system implemented that raises red flags whenever an individual purchases large quantities of ammunition and multiple weapons. With a system such as this in place, people like James Holmes would no longer fly under the radar in mass ammunitions acquisitions.
There is no clear-cut way to predict gun violence. Violence unfortunately forms a part of human nature, and when coupled with the presence of mental infirmities, it is near impossible to pinpoint if or when a person will endanger his or her own, or other’s lives. Continuing to throw restrictive legislation at the problem, therefore, is ineffective.
The recent incidents of gun-related violence render it increasingly clear that citizens cannot rely solely on the government for protection from harm. Law enforcement officials cannot be everywhere at all times, and citizens need to have the means to defend themselves should a threat to their lives arise.
The unspeakable events of the last few months should serve as reminders of the necessity to defend, not spurn, our Second Amendment rights more than ever before.
The right to bear arms essentially equates the right to protect one’s own life, and restricting this would not bode well for Americans and their most basic civil liberties.

In most states, one must undergo a very lengthy training (sometimes over a two-day period), with a range test as well. Then, it is up to the local police/sheriff to conduct a thorough background check on each person requesting the LTC, and the Police can select which level to grant, if at all. For example, an LTC to carry to and from the range only, or an LTC ‘for all lawful purposes.’ 
It is up to the individual to maintain integrity, to practice shooting, but also to train on being disciplined with regard to the firearm. We take a lot of training and have much respect for the firearms we carry, as well as knowing and understanding our responsibilities while having that firearm in our possession. We take this responsibility very seriously.
This is how the law-abiding, licensed citizen lives.
Anyone using firearms to commit their crimes would likely have committed them with or without firearm, certainly not legal, and therefore, no law could ever stop them.  Laws are made only for those who will not break them – for those who will break them, the law is of no consequence.
BTW, a friend, who carries, was in his car in a parking lot when a man jumped into the passenger seat and said “I’m going to Springfield!”  Friend pulls his pistol out, points it at the guy and says, “Not in this car.” and the man got out of that car and ran off. If friend hadn’t done that, he could have been car-jacked and worse…
Why do we have to become a victim to someone who would likely have gotten off with no punishment?
Have a nice day!
1. First of all, the argument that if we all had guns the world would be safer because we could shoot criminals is absurd. I do not want to live in a society where I have to have a gun to feel safe. When we are all armed that is the end of civilian life as it is currently understood. We have the social contract for a reason. 
2. No one is arguing that we should “restrict firearm access for everyone.” This is the classic straw man argument. Those of us in favor of more guns laws, think that this belief is warranted by the fact that people like Erik Harris, James Holmes, and others can get so much weaponry, so easily. We are not arguing about the second amendment; we are identifying a problem (maniacs acquire firearms so easily and kill inoccent people with them) and are searching for solutions.
3. Finally, your argument that “The recent incidents of gun-related violence render it increasingly clear that citizens cannot rely solely on the government for protection from harm” is self fulfilling. Of course a government that has so little gun-control laws and a hegemonic political platform that any gun control is sacrilege cannot deter violent crime effectively. But that is a reflection of the government as it is current constituted, not government itself. Do not deal in platitudes.
Finally a respectable opinion. As someone very familiar with the Aurora shootings, let me ask you this, Sarah: if people would have all started opening fire in that crowded theatre, do you honestly believe it would have helped? No. More chaos would have erupted, and we may be looking at something even worse. 1990 called – it wants your tired “theyre gonna take our guns away” nonsense.
Fake George above
I am reminded of the writtings of one of our republics founding fathers  (he helped write the 2nd amendment):
“A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I
advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives
boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no
character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion
of your walks.”
Thomas Jefferson, August 19, 1785
As a former police officer in California, I never came across a person who carried a concealed weapon, who had a right to carry it, to be other than an upstanding law-abiding citizen.  I was never afraid of a citizen who was licensed.   Finally, the point is well made that if our republic is unable to stop the flow of illegal drugs today, or alcohol during prohibition, how do you intend to stop firearms which are legally owned today?  It is a fools errand, that will never be accomplished.
The Govt should also have the responsibility of tracking who they have rendered this privilege to. Similar to how no 16+ year old Tom, Jane and Harry are permitted to drive a vehicle without a driver’s license (which may be suspended or revoked based on behavior), no Dick, Sarah and John should be permitted to use a weapon. There should be regular tests and license/weapon should be suspended based on behavior.  Also type of firearms should be restricted, mass murder weapons capable of shooting hundreds of rounds automatically should be barred. To say that a criminal would do whatever they want regardless of regulation is right, but the opportunity to become a mass murderer is just significantly easier with an unchecked 2nd amendment. This is the only condition I am willing to support the 2nd amendment. It is an old and antiquated “right” and needs to be amended for the modern world.
Everyone is entitled to their opininon, no matter how ignorant and misinformed it might be as it is in your case.  The first amendment gives you the right to express that opinion and the second one protects it.  People who are willing to give up rights for the “modern world” are doomed to have no rights whatsoever.  Your fears about every Dick, Jane, and Henry owning mass murder weapons are completely unfounded.  Go to a local gun shop and try to but an automatic weapon and see what they tell you.
Great article!
