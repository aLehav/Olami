Who will play in the secondary?
After Saturday’s game against Utah, USC coach Lane Kiffin intimated that changes would occur in the secondary. One thing is certain: sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey and junior safety T.J. McDonald have played well and are guaranteed to remain regulars. The other two spots in the secondary appear open to new faces. Thursday, Kiffin said junior safety Drew McAllister would see action on the third or fourth series.
Will USC be able to throw the ball effectively?
A year ago, Syracuse ranked seventh in total defense and pass defense. Through the first two games of the season, the Orange have surrendered 248 yards per game, good for 44th best in the nation. But they have already forced three interceptions. With sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods expected to draw double teams, junior quarterback Matt Barkley will be charged with spreading the ball around. Freshman tight end Xavier Grimble reeled in 5 catches for 66 yards against Utah, and he will likely play an important role against the Orange.
Is the Syracuse offense going to be one-dimensional?
With 78.5 rushing yards per game, Syracuse ranks 107th in the nation out of 120 teams. The Orange haven’t been able to create a plethora of holes for the running backs or protect the quarterback. To make matters worse, USC has done an admirable job combating the run and pressuring the quarterback. “They are playing really well,” Kiffin told reporters during the week. “They have done a good job against the run and knocking people back.”
Can the offense break out in the second half?
Through two games, the offense has scored seven points in the second half, and they have failed to score in the fourth quarter. USC had several chances to put Utah away, but they could not consistently pick up first downs and sustain drives. Additionally, Barkley’s performance has declined dramatically in the fourth quarter throughout his career. The junior quarterback has only completed 48.7 percent of his passes in the final period, compared to 65.3 percent in the first three quarters.

Despite two lackluster performances, the Trojans are off to a 2-0 start for the 10th year in a row. Only unbeaten Syracuse stands in the way of USC opening the season with a perfect 3-0 homestand. Both Minnesota and Utah were unable to find an answer for sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods and junior quarterback Matt Barkley as the dynamic duo have accounted for 279 yards and three touchdowns through the two games.
The Orange, however, might have the answer for the Trojans prolific passing attack.
In 2010, the Syracuse pass defense ranked sixth nationally, allowing just over 157 yards a game through the air. They yielded just 13 passing touchdowns all year long. Both safetys return from this unit from a year ago, Phillip Thomas and Shamarko Thomas (no relation).
Gone are steady cornerbacks Da’Mon Merkerson and Mike Holmes, but the trio of Kevyn Scott, Keon Lyn, and Ri’Shard Anderson appear to be capable replacements. Both Scott and Anderson played roles last year despite being hampered by injuries. Lyn played in nine games in 2010 and had a great spring.
If defensive coordinator, Scott Shafer, can mix his blitzes effectively and frustrate Barkley, the Trojans mightbe forced to turn to the ground game to carry them yet again. Coming off an 8-5 campaign, Syracuse is off to a 2-0 start. If itsdefense can return to its 2010 form, it could be yet another battle that goes right down to the wire at the Coliseum.
USC must be ready to handle the experienced secondary and find ways to utilize many targets to maximize Barkley’s effectiveness.
