Every GRAMMY show is as much about the awards as it is about the personalities of the stars that sit in their seats, awaiting the award announcements.
This year’s award show congregated a variety of artists from Muse to Justin Bieber and included strange sights including hip-hop gal Nicki Minaj in a completely leopard-print outfit and a Frankensteinian hairdo to Lady Gaga arriving in an egg carried by supermodels.
The real surprises came in a few important categories, namely the Best New Artist category.

The nominees included obvious favorites like Drake and Justin Bieber, but the award went to a figure many pop fans may not be familiar with: jazz bassist Esperanza Spalding. The 26-year-old from Oregon may not boast of Bieber’s fame, but the votes might prove she is making a name in the music world. She will be performing at Bovard on Feb. 26.
The pop and hip-hop genres received another blow in the Song of the Year category. Cee Lo Green’s highly infectious and playful track “F*** You,” along with Eminem and Rihannah’s raw and emotional collaboration in “Love the Way You Lie” missed snagging the honor.The award went to country band Lady Antebellum for “Need You Now,” which also took home Record of the Year. In the end “F*** You,” ended up snagging Best Urban Vocal Performance.
Arcade Fire’s success was officially cemented with their win for Album of the Year. The band’s The Suburbs beat out major contenders, including Eminem, Katy Perry and even Lady Gaga.
Not surprisingly, some of the most popular songs on the radio airwaves still took major awards. Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance” gave her Best Pop Female Performance and The Fame Monster snatched up Best Pop Vocal Album, leaving Bieber defeated once again.
Bruno Mars took away the Best Male Pop Vocal Performance and John Legend & the Roots went home with Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performnance.
Eminem’s “Not Afraid” received Best Rap Solo Performance, beating out fellow rappers Drake, T.I., Ludacris and the ever-controversial Kanye West in the only category West’s name was under.
Another year has come and gone for the GRAMMY awards and now that Lady Gaga has once again left her print on the music world and Kanye West most likely feels snubbed yet again, all a music fan can do is wait for next year’s award show and see what new Biebers crop in the meantime.

A group of Grammy winners and nominees gathered at the Key Club in West Hollywood on Saturday to discuss songwriting at BMI’s ‘How I Wrote That Song’ panel. The panel consisted of Cee-Lo Green, Claude Kelly, Seal, Chad Hugo, Bonnie McKee and BC Jean.
Catherine Brewton, vice president of BMI, moderated the show with co-host Dallas Austin, a famous producer, songwriter and musician.
Cee-Lo Green, who is now well-known for his fun and bitter hit song “F*ck You,” first discussed the writing process for “Crazy,” a song performed with Gnarls Barkley. At the time, in addition to not having a record deal, Green was also going through a divorce.
“[Crazy] resembled this inner chaos,” Green said.
Not surprisingly, “F*ck You” was a song written by a very fed-up Green. He wrote it during the long period he spent working on Lady Killer, when he was sick of recording songs and having ideas shot down.
“I did it to be ridiculous,” Green said. “It was meant to be spiteful.”
Such spite produced a hit song that has been nominated for four Grammys, not including Best Short Form Video.
Green also discussed writing from a female perspective for “Don’t Cha,” which is performed by the Pussycat Dolls.
“You either have to be in touch with your feminine side or be a lady’s man. I’m a lady’s man,” Green said.
Claude Kelly, who has written hit songs “Party in the USA” and “Circus,” discussed writing Kelly Clarkson’s “My Life Would Suck Without You,” Bruno Mars’ “Grenade” and Fantasia’s “Bittersweet.” He also shared his experience with writing from a female perspective as a man.
“You can’t write from a female perspective and think like a dude,” Kelly said.
However, there’s more work involved than simply writing from a generalized female perspective. When Kelly is in the recording studio, he channels the specific artist for whom he’s writing, making a clear distinction between the aesthetics of artists like Fantasia and Kelly Clarkson.
“You have to be kind of selfless to be a songwriter,” Kelly said.
Seal, an acclaimed, award-winning artist, talked a little about his start in the music business, but mostly discussed his famed song “Kiss from a Rose,” after being convinced to sing part of it for the audience. He almost didn’t include it on his 1994 album Seal II, because he didn’t think it was “edgy” enough, but complied after numerous people involved with the album were impressed by the song. Although “Kiss from a Rose” is now part of his identity as an artist, Seal admitted to being eternally embarrassed by the music video.
Chad Hugo of N.E.R.D. and the writing and producing duo, The Neptunes, didn’t speak very much, but discussed the process of writing “Rock Your Body” for Justin Timberlake.
“We wanted it to be disco without being too disco,” Hugo said.
Out of all the panel members, Bonnie McKee has written the most recent hit songs. Her portfolio includes Taio Cruz’s “Dynamite,” Britney Spears’ “Hold It Against Me” and collaborations with Katy Perry for “California Gurls” and “Teenage Dream.”
She described “Dynamite” as a song that practically wrote itself while “California Gurls” was supposed to have lighthearted, ‘90s summer feel to it.
McKee has been in Los Angeles writing songs for ten years and found the process of songwriting others a nice breath of air from being an artist. She believes that there will be a backlash to today’s overproduced sounds, leading to pop music becoming more organic.
Last but not least was BC Jean, who has written songs for artists like Miley Cyrus, or rather Hannah Montana, and has had to alter some of those songs in order to make them appropriate for PG and PG-13 audiences.
“I write a lot songs that I’m not going to use for myself, so I have to find new homes for them,” Jean said.
BC Jean may be most famous as the original singer of “If I Were a Boy.” Jean had been going through a bad breakup, which turned out to be the best thing in her life because it compelled her to write the hit song, which was later recorded by Beyoncé for her album I Am…Sasha Fierce.
The songwriters also offered advice to those aspiring to make it in the music industry.
“The only way you can make it is if you get addicted to music and chase that ‘chill’ factor,” Kelly said.
Panel members encouraged aspiring artists to not be deterred by negative responses.
“Every ‘no’ is one step closer to a ‘yes’,” Jean said.

The Graduate and Professional Student Senate is implementing a subsidized transit program for Fall 2011 that will reduce the cost of Metro passes for graduate students.
The program will allow graduate students to receive a discounted price for public transportation. Previously, students paid $32 per month, but now it will be $8.63 per semester.
Waiting ·A student waits at the bus stop at the intersection of 32nd and Hoover streets. Metro will now give graduate students a discounted pass. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan 
The idea for this program first began in Fall 2009 at a Campus Affairs committee meeting, where GPSS discussed the difficulty students had receiving passes from Metro.
In February 2010, GPSS representatives met with UCLA’s transportation committee to discuss ideas for a subsidized transit program.
“UCLA has a program like this that has been working for them. We wanted to talk to them and see how they had done it,” said Jenny Novak, president of GPSS.
The transportation committee learned through a survey of 987 graduate students and 12 undergraduate students, that 33.43 percent drive alone to campus, 18.95 percent use public transportation, 3.55 percent carpool, 21.48 percent ride bikes, 18.14 percent walk and 3.44 percent find other means of transportation.
Of the students surveyed, 73.96 percent said they would purchase a discounted Metro card at USC.
Based on the ridership at USC, Metro agreed to lower the student rate for graduate students because it is a profit-neutral number for them. With this new program, graduate students will only need to verify their enrollment at certain on-campus locations, the specifics of which have not been announced yet.
Not only will this new program make the process of receiving a Metro pass more efficient, it will also give students another option for transportation.
“Hopefully people not thinking about using buses before will start thinking of public transportation as a new and better option,” said Mary Kuhn, a graduate student studying urban planning and development who worked on the committee that met with Metro.
Keith Henkel, a graduate student studying biomedical engineering, said he wishes the Metro pass had become available earlier.
“I live right by a bus stop, and I have to pay a lot driving back and forth to campus, plus parking is always hard to find,” Henkel said. “For $8 a semester, I would have been on the bus all the time.”
This program, however, is only available for the graduate students at USC and not the undergraduate population.
Undergraduates will still have to pay $32 per month for a Metro card if they choose to buy one and will have to send their applications to Metro to be approved for a pass.
Although there have been no formal plans to continue the subsidized transit program with the undergraduate population, Kuhn said USG is looking into the possibility to expanding the program to include undergraduates.
“We want to roll the [Metro] program out to the whole school eventually,” Kuhn said. “USG has been supportive of our program and is interested in implementing it for the undergraduate students at some point.”
USG President Chris Cheng, said USG is busy working on other programs that are costly, and a subsidized transit program is not as essential for undergraduate students who tend to live on or near campus.
“If we were to implement the subsidized transit program, that money would go out of the mandatory fees that everyone pays,” Cheng said. “We want to make sure that the money students pay gets back to them and they get what they’re paying for. If not all the students are using public transportation, then we want to use the money for something that is useful to them.”
I would like it on the record that I do not ride buses.
I ride the Metro almost weekly to get off campus.  I wish I could pay $1.60 per month (versus the undergraduate alternative of $32 per month, in which case a pass may cost more than not having a pass.)

The university has begun searching for a senior vice president for health, a new position that will involve overseeing the clinical aspects of USC’s academic medical center, ensuring the quality of treatment at the hospitals and helping to recruit more exceptional doctors.
In short, the senior vice president for health will work to increase the capacity of the university’s clinical operations, which include the Doctors of USC, USC CARE ­— an 800 number that allows patients to make appointments with USC doctors, the Norris Cancer Hospital and the USC University Hospital.
“There are a lot of pieces that need to be put together in order to make this enterprise successful, so having someone in charge is necessary,” said Dr. Peter Conti, president of faculty for the Keck School of Medicine.
The senior vice president for health will report directly to President C. L. Max Nikias, and work closely with Provost Elizabeth Garrett and Carmen Puliafito, dean of the Keck School of Medicine. The chief executive officer of USC Hospitals will report to the new senior vice president.
Nikias has formed a search committee for the position that includes Garrett, Senior Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Robert Abeles, department chairs at the Keck School of Medicine and others. Nikias has also requested that Conti and representatives of the Keck faculty review the final candidates.
The committee is searching for candidates who are entrepreneurial, will establish connections, will work to make USC more attractive for research and are familiar with health care and biomedical sciences, according to Conti.
“This person needs to have a sense that everything we do is driven by academics,” Garrett said.
Nikias is also creating the Medical Enterprise Oversight Committee, which will be in charge of making decisions that will advance USC’s academic, clinical and research priorities.
The committee will be chaired by Garrett and will include the new senior vice president for health. The committee will seek to improve the university’s medical enterprise by training the future generation of doctors and medical professors, providing care in hospitals and providing top-notch research in translational sciences.
“Translational sciences are when you bring research out of the lab and into the bed of the patient,” Garrett said. “You bring the research out into the community.”
To allow the committee to do those things, the senior vice president for health will need to help bring in more revenue.
“We’re trying to increase the overall revenue available for the medical enterprise so we can provide more support for better facilities, research and for more medical students,” Abeles said.
Though the committee and the senior vice president for health won’t have a huge impact on the daily lives of the student body, there are positive opinions.
“I feel this initiative will make it good to stick with USC for graduate school if it brings about more research, connections and opportunities,” said Kunal Bhan, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience. “It would definitely make me want to stay at USC for medical school.”
Garrett, Abeles and Conti all hope to have a final candidate chosen by this summer.
The first new rule says you HAVE to have insurance. Both my husband and I have pre-existing conditions, and although the new bill says we can’t be denied coverage because of it. So far, the cheapest health insurance we’ve been able to find is called “Wise Health Insurance” search for it online if you are pre-existing conditions.

A common goal on the platforms of Undergraduate Student Government presidential tickets has been to extend the use of USCard to local businesses. But despite the interest of students and off-campus restaurants in using USCard discretionary money for off-campus purchases, the USC Auxiliary Services staff said this change seems unlikely.
Coffee · Chenu Jayewickrem, a junior majoring in biology, uses cash to pay for his drink at Seattle’s Best Coffee, a coffee shop in Gateway apartments. Many students wish off-campus businesses accepted USCard. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
“The underlying assumption for parents is that the money is going to be used on campus,” said Mark Ewalt, director of operations of Auxiliary Services. “Not on alcohol, not on any restaurant. It’s been on campus for a long time, and there are many credit cards that serve that purpose.”
Many students say using USCard off campus would make purchasing easier.
“It would be more convenient for the university and the entire community if we were on the same system,” said Laura Lindeen, a sophomore majoring in psychology and linguistics.
Ewalt said even though the underlying notion is that discretionary money is to be used on-campus, he does understand why students would find it convenient to be able to use their cards at off-campus locations.
“I totally get the convenience side, but USC has got to ask, is this a compelling enough reason to extend the service beyond the confines of the campus,” Ewalt said. “We get it, we understand it, but is that USC’s responsibility? That’s kind of where the line is drawn.”
According to Bernie Moreno, assistant director of operations for USCard Services, it would be relatively easy to enable restaurants off-campus to accept USCcard for purchases.
“From a technology standpoint it’s doable,” Moreno said. “A lot of this comes down to whether USC wants us to do this or not.”
Moreno said despite the relatively easy transition, USC still needs to think about its place in the wider L.A. community.
“The questions are how the university sees our role and how the university sees its role,” Moreno said. “How does USC see itself in the community and does the extension of discretionary change that idea and affect that idea?”
A representative from Seattle’s Best Coffee said it would be interested in this method of payment if USC gave it the opportunity.
“If it was a possibility, this is something we would be interested in, but I don’t have the authority to say yes or no,” said Katie Watkins, assistant manager of Seattle’s Best Coffee.
George Kim, manager, director and co-owner of Soy Japanese Grill and Roll, said he believes USC should poll student opinion on using discretionary money at off-campus locations.
“I’d love the opportunity to join USC and be a part of discretionary funds,” Kim said. “On campus, there might be some resistance. But I think the students should take a vote because I’ve heard the interest level on that is very positive.”
Moreno said he’s worried about selectivity of the businesses where students can use USCard.
“If you decide to do Subway but not Quiznos, you can go into an unfair legal business practice,” Moreno said.
Aside from restaurants off-campus showing interest in expanding the USCard services, many students are equally interested.
Christen Lazarcheck, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism, said she doesn’t like carrying her wallet with her off-campus, so the option of using discretionary funds would simplify the problem.
“Students just need to question whether they feel more comfortable going off campus with their wallets or with just their discresh cards,” Lazarcheck said.
Other students however, said they wouldn’t use their USCards even if they could because they don’t use discretionary.
“I don’t use mine because I can’t load [discretionary dollars] with foreign cards, so it would be worthless for me to use off-campus,” said Katie Maslechko, a sophomore majoring in policy, planning, and development.
Ultimately, Ewalt said, it is much easier to manage the system when the boundaries are specifically drawn to only include USC establishments.
“It makes sense to have it on campus, that’s what it was designed for,” Ewalt said.
Just a quick correction regarding discretionary deposits via credit cards – any Visa, Mastercard or Discover credit card is accepted by USCard regardless of the Bank of origin.  Many international students and parents use credit cards from their countries.  Students may also charge their deposits to their University Bill (within limits set by USCard).

After consecutive losses, the USC women’s swimming and diving team bounced back in a big way, winning its final dual meet of the season.
USC qualified two swimmers for the NCAA Championships and managed to break several pool and dual meet records, on its way to a 176-124 victory over UCLA.
Record setter · Senior co-captain Lyndsay DePaul had arguably her best performance of the year, breaking a personal best in the 200-yard fly. - Anna Wierzbowska | Daily Trojan 
The temperature reached a high of 79 degrees in McDonald’s Swim Stadium on Saturday afternoon as the USC swimmers took on their crosstown rivals.
No. 6 USC (9-2, 4-2) was coming off losses against Cal and Stanford, but managed to make a statement against No. 21 UCLA (9-4, 3-4).
The last time the Women of Troy had nine wins in their dual meet season was in 1997, when they won the only NCAA title in team history.
“[This win] really bodes well for the rest of the season,” said USC coach Dave Salo. “We did well, we put up some really good times and were in control of the meet the whole time.”
Although the Bruins were successful in breaking a couple of pool records and posted fast times in several races, the Women of Troy won all but three of the day’s events.
Senior Lyndsay DePaul broke her own pool record and set a new personal best in the 200-yard fly, while freshman Stina Gardell and junior Katinka Hosszu broke pool records previously held by DePaul in the 400-yard IM and 100-yard free, respectively.
Gardell’s time in the 400-yard IM was recorded as third-best in the country.
Sophomores Jessica Schmitt and Haley Anderson and freshman Kasey Carlson also set dual meet records in the 200-yard breaststroke, 100-yard freestyle and 100-yard breaststroke, respectively.
DePaul, one of the team’s co-captains, was pleased with the results.
“After our losses against Cal and Stanford the team morale was kind of low,” she said. “After seeing those times we set, we had no idea we could post those up. They definitely made a statement to us and to those who were watching.”
According to Salo, the pivotal moment of the meet was not a certain record broken, but when three USC swimmers placed first, second and third in one event.
“The turning point of the meet was when we went 1-2-3 in the 100 backstroke,” Salo said. “Any time you can go 1-2 [or] 1-2-3, it is a significant change of events. That really set the tone for the rest of the meet.”
Overall, the team found the records set and goals that it reached in its final dual meet of the season pleasing and a bit unexpected.
“We are all pretty surprised with the results,” DePaul said. “Very few of us were rested, but we worked really hard. It was exciting, it was fun and we did much better than we anticipated.”

In a game marked by scoring bursts, the USC women’s basketball team had the biggest — and last — run.
Deadlocked at 53-53 midway through the second half, the Women of Troy (15-8, 7-5) scored 19 straight points to secure an 85-63 victory over Oregon. The win gave USC a season sweep of the Oregon schools and moved the team back into sole possession of third place in the Pac-10.
Dual threat · Junior guard Briana Gilbreath not only recorded 14 points on Saturday against Oregon, but also finished with 10 rebounds. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
In a back-and-forth first half, the Women of Troy countered an 11-0 run by Oregon with a 7-0 run of their own. USC took a 38-35 lead into the break before turning in another dominant second half.
Picking up where they left off against Oregon State, the Women of Troy shot 45 percent for the game, including a torrid 51 percent in the second half. USC held Oregon to 33 percent shooting in the second half and outscored the Ducks 47-28 in the second half.
Once again, the difference for the Women of Troy came on the backboards.  USC outrebounded the Ducks 53-34 for the game. During their 19-0 burst, the Women of Troy outrebounded Oregon 13-4.
Four players scored in double-digits for the Women of Troy, led by redshirt senior guard Jacki Gemelos’ 18 points. Junior guard Ashley Corral, already the career leader in three-pointers, added four more threes on the night and finished with 16 points. Freshman forward Cassie Harberts added 15 points, and junior guard Briana Gilbreath picked up another double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds.
Gemelos, Corral and Gilbreath all handed out five assists on the night. As a team, the Women of Troy collected 21 assists.
Three players scored at least 15 points for the Ducks, although USC held the rest of the team in check.  No other Oregon player scored more than six points. Ten players scored for the Women of Troy.
Earlier this season, USC coach Michael Cooper said his team would need 20 wins to make it to the NCAA tournament. With the pair of wins in Oregon, the Women of Troy have six games remaining and the Pac-10 tournament to add more wins.
First up for USC is a home date against No. 3 Stanford Friday.  The Cardinal beat USC 95-51 last month in Palo Alto, Calif.  The Women of Troy have another opportunity to exact revenge when they host California Saturday. The Bears beat USC 82-71 earlier this season.
Must beat Cal this weekend at home, and at least give Stanford a game for the 1st half or longer. Hopefully someone will step up big time to close out the regular season to make a difference.

To begin, a brief public service announcement: The 2010-2011 USC men’s basketball team is not very good. You might have noticed this, particularly if you ventured to the corner of Jefferson and Figueroa Saturday night.
USC has lost six of its last nine games. In the current calendar year, it has yet to win back-to-back games. And presently, it ranks eighth in a conference, which has an RPI rating just a notch above that of Conference USA.
In short, it’s tough to mention USC and the NCAA Tournament in the same breath without uttering the word “out.”
Despite early postseason aspirations, it has become increasingly difficult to envision a scenario in which the Trojans secure a berth in the Big Dance without winning next month’s Pac-10 tournament. And doing so won’t be easy.
If Saturday’s 61-51 loss at the hands of Oregon provided any lessons to the cardinal-clad fans in attendance, it served as a stark reminder of how inefficient USC has become, namely on offense.
Through the first 20 minutes of the contest, the Trojans amassed a mere 19 points, shooting a combined 25 percent while simultaneously setting offensive basketball back 25 years.
“I don’t drink coffee, but I might as well start now,” remarked an NBA scout sitting near press row.
To put it plainly: There wasn’t much production from USC. Outside of junior forward Nikola Vucevc’s 22 points, the next highest figure came from freshman guard Maurice Jones and senior guard Donte Smith, who each finished with nine. Collectively, they shot 36 percent from the field, in addition to an assist-to-turnover ratio of 5:4. Impressive, huh?
“We’re not going to win many games scoring 50,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “That’s all I can say about that.”
Safe to say, USC’s offensive problems have become glaringly obvious in recent weeks. Too many missed 3-point attempts from a group that faces sagging 2-3 zone defenses night after night. Too many possessions in which swinging the ball on the perimeter takes the better part of the 35-second shot clock. Too many missed layups from players who are said to have “NBA potential.”
When the Trojans nearly upset then-No. 3 Kansas in mid-December, when they looked like a team that could possibly finish in the upper-echelon of the Pac-10, they saw multiple players scoring in double figures. They appeared capable of putting points on the scoreboard at least somewhat consistently.
Nowadays, they just seem gassed. Of USC’s 12 losses this season, seven have come on Saturdays, typically two days removed from a Thursday night Pac-10 game. As has been well-documented, USC utilizes a seven-man rotation, and now it seems the lack of depth has caught up with O’Neill’s bunch.
The second-year headman, however, has nonetheless resisted the urge to cite the team’s shortage of bodies as an excuse for the recent downward trend.
“To me, fatigue shouldn’t be a factor,” O’Neill said. “I’d like to make that excuse. But to me, there’s no excuse to be made. If you don’t get the job done, you don’t get the job done.”
But where O’Neill wishes to point his finger is his prerogative.
Depth is a serious issue, and that has become plainly evident during the team’s most recent slide. Not necessarily just in terms of players playing too many minutes, but in terms of lineup options.
The roster, as currently constructed, doesn’t have any wing players who can score on a consistent basis. Senior forward Marcus Simmons averages 4.8 points per game. Freshman forward Garrett Jackson, who is already playing more minutes than anticipated, averages 4.1 points per game. Neither is, by Pac-10 standards, a consistent scoring threat.
There isn’t a backup center or power forward to alleviate some of the pressure placed on Vucevic or senior center Alex Stepheson. And there really isn’t a pass-first point guard on the roster either.
This isn’t meant as a knock on the current group.
If there were another player or two, maybe they’d be in contention for the Big Dance. Heck, maybe even if freshman guard Bryce Jones were still on the roster, they’d be closing in on 20 wins.
But that’s not the case. This is essentially a seven-man team, and based on what transpired Saturday night, it’s missing quite a few pieces.
Through 25 games, this team’s identity is more than evident: It’s a middle-of-the-road Pac-10 basketball team, if that, and it has a long way to go before it goes dancing in March.

Sophomore forward Donte Smith?
The Trojans put their own sanction on being in the tournament this season with their inept play. The Head Coach needs to take half the blame at least for all this debacle. Some thing is amiss when you beat Texas real good, lose by two at Kansas, beat Tennessee on the road, beat ucla at home by double digits, and go overtime with UW then have major breakdowns.

The USC men’s volleyball team lost its first match of the season to the No. 11 Pepperdine Waves with scores 25-23, 20-25, 23-25, 25-16, 17-15.
The loss snapped a six-game winning streak, the best the program has had since 1994.
Carrying the weight · Despite the loss, senior opposite Murphy Troy recorded yet another impressive outing with 29 kills Friday night. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“To oversimplify it, we’re 6-1,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “We’re fine, we’re still the same team, nothing to freak out about. We just need to come in and play better.”
The Trojans played the Waves and traded blows like prizefighters in each set, finishing with a deuce game in the fifth set.
“It was a tough loss,” said senior setter Riley McKibbin. “We just have to bounce back. We have a 25 game season and anything can happen in this league — you can’t expect to go undefeated.”
The parity in the MPSF wasn’t limited to the tough loss in Malibu. UC San Diego, which the Trojans systematically swept, took down No. 2 Stanford on Friday evening. No. 3 BYU also lost to unranked Loyola.
“Pepperdine always seem to figure it out against us when they’re at home,” McKibbin said. “Being No. 1, everybody wants to take us down. Everyone gets amped up to play against a No. 1 team and we’re USC, so everybody hates us anyway.”
Senior opposite Murphy Troy led the way with 29 kills earned at a .435 clip, including big kills at the end of the match to push the Waves to a deuce in the fifth set and a team-high eight digs. In the process, he broke the USC scoring record in the rally-scoring era.
Senior outside hitter Tri Bourne and junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli also chipped in with 15 and 11 kills, respectively.
“Murphy played a good match,” Ferguson said. “He had some big kills to keep the game close when we needed him too.”
The Trojans dug 34 balls Friday evening, far below their 10-dig-per-set average this season.
“The story of that game is that we didn’t serve them out of system,” Ferguson said. “They ran their offense out of the middle and they got a lot of free looks.”
The Waves exhibited a balanced attack, with four hitters earning more than 10 kills. Sophomore opposite Maurice Torres led the way with 17 kills, followed by redshirt sophomore Beau Vandeweghe’s 15 kills and junior middle blocker Matt Pollock’s 12 kills.
Pepperdine also managed to hit an astronomical .550 and .706 in the fourth and fifth sets respectively.
“They kept siding out and we eventually made an attack error,” Ferguson said. “When it keeps going that long into the fifth, anything can happen.”
The Trojans have relied on a consistent and efficient middle attack this season, but only managed to get junior middle blocker Steven Shandrick only five attempts while senior middle blocker Austin Zahn sat the game out with a sprained ankle. Redshirt junior middle blocker Ian Wright filled in with seven kills.
“They weren’t paying attention to Ian,” Ferguson said. “They were jumping all over Shandrick and really set up to stop him.”
Pepperdine’s size and physicality helped them match USC point for point, finishing with 23 blocks and forcing the Trojans into hitting an uncharacteristically low .292.
“They played very well tonight —hats off to them,” Ferguson said.  “We didn’t play as well as we could have for sure, but we had a lot of chances to put the game away.”

When the Oregon men’s basketball team came to the Galen Center on Saturday, neither the Ducks nor the Trojans could generate many points.
USC started the game cold, only scoring 19 points and shooting just under 26 percent in the first half.
Oregon (13-12, 6-7) did not shoot much better, accumulating 25 points in the opening half on 33 percent shooting.
Main threat · USC junior forward Nikola Vucevic shouldered the offensive load once again, scoring 22 points and grabbing 16 rebounds, his 14th double-double of the season. The next-closest scorers, Maurice Jones and Donte Smith, had nine points each. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Both teams shot 50 percent in the second half, but Oregon came out on top, 61-51.
For the game, the Trojans (13-12, 5-7) made three of 19 three-point attempts and missed half of their 12 free throws.
“You are not going to win many games shooting like we did,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill.
After defeating Oregon State on Thursday, the Trojans had hoped to earn their first Pac-10 Conference weekend sweep.
“It is tough when we try to win two games in a row and get a streak going, and we cannot do it,” said junior forward Nikola Vucevic. “It is frustrating, but the only thing we can do is keep playing.”
Vucevic scored USC’s first six points, and 10 of the Trojans’ first 15 points. He led the Trojans with 22 points and 16 rebounds, although he missed 11 of his 22 field goal attempts.
“[Vucevic] missed seven or eight lay-ups,” O’Neill said. “As he gets older, he has to dunk [the ball].”
No other USC player scored more than nine points. Three players — Vucevic, freshman guard Maurice Jones and senior guard Donte Smith — combined to score 40 of the Trojans’ 51 points.
“Basketball is a team game,” Vucevic said. “I would rather have 10 points and have the rest of the guys get 10 points too if we win than me getting 30 points and we keep losing.”
Jones contributed nine points and six assists for the Trojans. Junior guard Jio Fontan also had six assists.
Smith started the game wearing tape on his right thumb as a result of an injury suffered Thursday against Oregon State.
Midway through the first half, Smith ripped off the tape.
He missed his first four three-point attempts, and finished with nine points on 1-of-8 shooting from beyond the arc.
The Ducks were paced by guard Malcolm Armstead, who had 14 points and five assists off the bench.
“Armstead killed us,” O’Neill said. “Not one guy stayed in front of Armstead all night long.”
From the end of the first half through the beginning of the second half, the Ducks went on a 10-0 run.
The Trojans responded, going on a 11-2 run of their own to cut Oregon’s lead to 34-30.
The Ducks then went on another run, scoring 11 of the game’s next 16 points to extend their lead.
USC went on a 9-2 run late to cut Oregon’s lead to eight, but it was too little, too late.

The Trojans will play their first game outside of Los Angeles in the month of February when they travel to Berkeley to play at California on Feb. 17.
The Trojans fell to the Golden Bears (13-12, 6-7) on Jan. 22, 68-66, despite a career-high 24 points from Smith, who made eight three-pointers.
Cal, which has lost its last three games, is led by forward Harper Kamp, who averages 14.8 points and 5.5 rebounds per game.

Friday night, as most of West Los Angeles threw back shots of Smirnoff and waited in queues for expensive pre-Grammy parties, a little theater in East Hollywood had a different bill to offer. 
The Canadian indie rock demigods of Arcade Fire had arrived in town to perform at the Sunday night awards show, but managed to swing by the Ukrainian Cultural Arts Center for a cheap, all-ages show.
After selling out The Shrine Auditorium for two nights last October and now headlining 2011’s Coachella, Arcade Fire’s decision to bring its live show to an intimate, 500-person venue sent shockwaves through the Twitter universe.
Thursday night saw hundreds of hipsters camped outside Origami Records, the El Rey and Long Beach’s Fingerprints in hopes of snagging the hottest ticket of the weekend.
No doubt sleep-deprived, the prosperous crowd that packed the bare confines of the arts center on Friday night looked weary upon entry.
Thankfully, event promoters FYF and Goldenvoice provided free cotton candy and sodas, which attendees inhaled gladly.
Moments after 9 p.m., the lights darkened to gladiatorial roars and all eight members of Arcade Fire emerged from backstage, led by a dancing Regine Chassagne. Front man Win Butler, still sporting a half-shaved head, wordlessly shouldered a guitar and led the band into a scorching rendition of “Month of May.”
The audience members ate it up, whipping their heads and swapping looks of stunned disbelief.
“It was 30 below when we left Montreal to come here,” a grinning Butler told the crowd, shedding his jacket to reveal an already sweat soaked T-shirt. “So L.A., let me tell you that we are really, really happy to be here.”
The band continued onward with a set list that drew heavily from its 2004 debut LP Funeral.
The timelessly anthemic “Rebellion (Lies)” came early, but drew the crowd to a euphoric, fist-pumping finish. “Wake Up” remained luminescent as ever from the opening chorus to its shuffle-inducing breakdown.
Neon Bible’s “No Cars Go,” also played early in the set, was pure thunder, with the entire audience joining in on the song’s closing chants.
Despite a murky sound arrangement, the band played exquisitely, frequently swapping instruments.
Each number was perfectly timed, but, more importantly, played with enrapturing enthusiasm. Butler’s younger brother, Will, was particularly kinetic, moving about like a metronome, leaping from an organ and, at one point, thrusting a drum into his brother’s chest while pounding it.
From the perspective of another band, such a display of vigor might seem forced and pandering but somehow, Arcade Fire manages it effortlessly.
The band also reminded fans that one can remain cool while championing a political cause. Before launching into “Haiti,” Butler appealed to the crowd to encourage the Haitian government to “sue the fucking shit” out of former dictator Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier, whose murderous reign forced Chassagne to flee Haiti for Montreal with her parents as a child.
The high point of the show came during the encore performance of the synth-filled “Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)”. As Chassagne cried, “I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights,” the entire auditorium was immersed in darkness, with the technicians killing the lighting rig at Butler’s impassioned request.
It was as honest and as unglamorous a move as any Grammy-nominated act could muster.
Given Arcade Fire’s admirable history of resisting popular live convention, the concert was a powerful gesture.
After all, this is the same band who was famous for playing secondary sets in the lobbies of venues after performing.
In recent years, the ballooning of Arcade Fire’s catalog and prestige has made such bursts of spontaneity rare.
This is a natural, if melancholic, transition for rock stars which, whether they like it or not, Butler and Co. have become. Friday’s show was a brief cry of rebellion.
Those who braved the dynamics of late-night Los Angeles and packed the arts center witnessed the band in its best form, in a setting that it will likely not revisit anytime soon.
As the crowd spilled out of the arts center at 10:45 p.m., a hopeful throng lingered by the doors for one more lobby encore or perhaps the sight of Butler openly getting a drink at the bar. Sadly, moments like these are now few and far between.
Even the few fans still inside the venue seemed to realize this, and finally wandered off into the night, ready to dance and cry at once.

Last Wednesday, Professor of Polymathy Sidney Harman boldly proclaimed that he would “contaminate the entire university” at the inaugural event for the Academy of Polymathic Study.
The event marked the creation of one of the few institutions of polymathic study across the United States.
Cindy Lee | Daily Trojan
Polymaths are people who live the Renaissance ideal; They are proficient in many different fields, be it music, science, engineering, art, English, etc.
USC’s Academy seeks to bring together a collection of faculty and students to form a library-centered series of discussions “anchored in and structured by four Quadrants of Polymathic Inquiry, critical and integrative thinking, study of the great polymaths, tapestry, and communication.”
Students must apply to become Academy Fellows, and accepted students who successfully complete 10 meetings during their undergraduate study at USC are eligible for an Academy Certificate of Recognition.
Hopefully, by the program’s completion, students will be able to illuminate one field of study with the perspective of another.
“Our process of the metacognitive is essential to our successes,” Harman said Wednesday.
Academy Fellows will “review the manner, product, and thinking of the great polymaths.”
Polymaths such as Leonardo DaVinci, Albert Einstein and Johann Goethe were not only considered great within the specialties they originally pursued, but as Harman said, “the magic of their work was the way they synthesized and integrated [their] disciplines.”
The Academy is dedicated to engaging both the faculty and the students in an interactive activity to question orthodoxy through the integration of technology, art and philosophy.
Future events include a luncheon series on polymathy in research and conversations about “multiple realities through digital technology, theoretic physics and a polymathic approach to literature, cinema and cultural history.”
The events are open to all USC students, not just Academy Fellows, but, the task of improving outreach to students remains.
The news of the new Academy is currently spreading through the honors student circles through e-mails from the academic recognition program, Thematic Option, etc, and bypassing the majority of the university.
The awareness of the growing importance of integrated interdisciplinary studies is understood by all USC students, and the Academy should publicize its events with that in mind.
One avenue to advertise would be the interdisciplinary studies major.
Traditionally viewed as a piece-meal major with minimal career potential, it might prove relevant to solving current problems, as increased globalization has led to a need for expertise in more than one field alone.
USC has also pioneered several new majors that integrate several disciplines into a more coherent track of study.
Global health incorporates international relations, economics and health promotion and disease prevention.
Politics, law and society melds public policy, philosophy and political science. Health and humanity, narrative studies  and bioethics all recognize the need for a broader view toward solving modern-day problems.
The Renaissance ideal receives special emphasis at USC through the Renaissance Scholar program, which recognizes USC students who have double majored or minored in disparate areas of study, such as chemical engineering and comparative literature.
USC also highly encourages picking up an extra minor or two, double majoring, double majoring with a minor, triple majoring or whatever ambitious derivative a student might desire.
This supportive atmosphere actually played a major role in my decision to attend USC, and, from conversations with other students, apparently it held influence over other people’s choices as well.
The new Academy just serves as another piece of evidence that the USC student should be a well-rounded scholar whose explorations and interests ignore the arbitrary boundaries of academic fields of study.

Mark Emmert has only been the NCAA president for four months, yet he is already making strides to improve communication with the media and the public.
Emmert discussed some of his ideas at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis on Saturday night before a number of Associated Press sports editors.
He spoke to the journalists about how he wants the media and NCAA to work together “so that we can raise the level of understanding on our side and on your side about what these process[es] are and what they aren’t.”
So what exactly are some of these policies he is referring to? One in particular is the idea of pay-for-play, dealing with the NCAA’s policy of ensuring that players receive no form of compensation as an incentive to play for a specific university.
This past season, there was a lot of discussion about Auburn quarterback, and Heisman Trophy winner, Cam Newton. Newton’s father, Cecil, was believed by the NCAA to have sought money from Mississippi State. The NCAA determined his son had no involvement, and he thus remained eligible throughout the season. He later led Auburn to a national championship.
“We try to get it right every time,” Emmert said. “The cases we saw this fall were highly controversial and highly debatable. I understand that, and some of them were even enormously frustrating to me.”
When Emmert was asked about college athletes being paid, he replied with, “No, it will not happen- not while I’m president of the NCAA.”
Emmert is considering holding a mock hearing and allowing media members to participate to further help them understand NCAA processes.
Emmert is the NCAA’s fifth president after previously serving as the president at the University of Washington.

Try mentioning the word ‘run,’ and most people are sent running, though not for the treadmills.
Over time, people have misconstrued running as a sport designed solely for those blessed with superior lung functions and shiny, strong calves.
But such assumptions shouldn’t be an excuse for avoiding participation in one of the most exciting community events: races.
Yes, most people don’t classify themselves as hardcore runners, but local races aren’t confined to the running elite.
In fact, most participants are your everyday moms, dads and teenagers.
Local races aren’t as boring as they sound either, especially when they’re promoted during particularly festive times.
This past weekend featured an array of Valentine’s Day-inspired races. In California, nearly every major city hosted a run/walk benefit.
On Saturday, Sacramento held its 8th Annual Valentine Run and San Francisco hosted the San Francisco Valentine’s Run.
And let’s not forget the Chinese New Year. To celebrate, Los Angeles held a joint 5K and 10K race yesterday called the Chinatown Firecracker. Both courses began on North Broadway with the 10K path winding through the beautiful Elysian Park hills. The 5K route finished at Dodger Stadium.
Some of you might be thinking, “So what? What’s the allure of stomping away and gasping for air like a fish out of water?”
To start, you don’t need to be a runner to register for a race.
These aren’t full-fledged marathons we are talking about. Anybody can participate as long as they can walk at least a few miles continuously.
There’s not only Valentine’s Day to get excited for.
Almost every major holiday is accompanied by an array of celebratory races, during which people can show their holiday spirit.
Themed races are some of the most popular races among young adults today. These races are usually less competitive and more carefree than big events like the Boston Marathon.
On Halloween, for example, racers don costumes and makeup, whereas at Christmas time runners wear Santa hats and reindeer antlers.
Themed races also tend to have unique sets of rules and requirements.
San Luis Obispo’s Chains of Love event this past Saturday included a couples division for those running in the spirit of St. Valentine, and yesterday’s Puppy Love 5K Run/Walk in San Diego allowed participants to race with their dogs.
And what’s better than getting free food and treats after a fulfilling workout? The majority of races guarantee water and food after a hard day’s run.
But let’s be honest. Most non-runners aren’t good at running, so what’s the point of entering a race if you have no chance of winning it?
Even if your running is poor, many races reward their participants with participation medals upon completion.
The point of these races is not necessarily to win, but rather to enjoy the feeling that comes from personal accomplishment and communal celebration.
Many races, both themed and not themed, are designed to encourage the participation of whole families too.
Several of the California races this last weekend, such as Monterey’s Together with Love event, included separate, shorter courses for children.
If neither holiday cheer nor free food is enticing enough, at least consider registering for a race in the spirit of charity.
Nearly all proceeds from fundraising and registration fees go toward the specific charity that is sponsoring the race.
For Valentine’s Day weekend, several of the races in California capitalized on the holiday with love-themed races that raised money for heart disease research.
Fresno hosted a large charity run/walk for the It’s My Heart foundation to raise awareness for congenital heart defects, and Ventura hosted the 21st Annual Ojai Classic Heart and Sole Run to benefit the American Heart Association.
Even if you’re not a runner or haven’t quite warmed up to the idea of entering races yet, at least use the holidays each season as an excuse to try something new.
Now is a great time to register and start preparing for next month’s St. Patrick’s Day and Mardi Gras races. Consider celebrating these holidays in a healthy, fun and charitable way.

With a myriad of exemplary feature animation films emerging in the last few years, the bar was set high for Gnomeo and Juliet.
But instead, the cheesy pun for a title was backed up by an equally cheesy flick without much merit.
Along the same lines of Toy Story, these gnomes, along with the other garden fixtures, come alive as soon as their owners turn their backs.
The film is a remake of William Shakespeare’s classic tragedy Romeo and Juliet, something that has been done hundreds of times before, but  never before with garden gnomes.
The film strays far from the original Shakespeare tale, but it is packed with allusions to Shakespeare’s work to validate its name and storyline.
The Bard himself even makes an awkward and out-of-place cameo as a statue to discuss with Gnomeo whether or not the movie should stay true to the play. Of course, Gnomeo thinks it should not.
The animation is a little behind our time with lackluster 3-D effects. The effects do enough to keep young children on the edge of their seats, but they do not match up to those 3-D giants Avatar, How to Train Your Dragon or even Up.
If this movie is still on your agenda, save your money and go for the 2-D showing, since there is not much of a difference.
Despite these flaws, the star-studded cast is a delight to hear. Actors James McAvoy (Gnomeo) and Emily Blunt (Juliet) are able to use their familiar voices and charm to draw the audience in. From Jason Statham and Ozzy Osbourne to Michael Caine and Patrick Stewart, the voices deliver and, though suprising, it is nonetheless refreshing to have these names attached to the project.
The music, however, reminded me too much of the oh-so-popular and memorable Lion King.
With Elton John serving as the producer as well as music director, one would hope to hear something more interesting.
Instead, the music is mostly John’s old songs reworked to fit with gnomes. There are a few new songs that are enjoyable, but not particularly noteworthy.
The film even showcases a star-shaped, glasses-wearing gnome to stress John’s appearance even further.
The film is somewhat entertaining. It was fun, but received few laughs from the young audience.
Mainly directed toward that younger audience, the film is packed with forced humor and reference to pop culture to appease teenagers and adults.
Line after line and reference after reference, this technique wears thin quickly and made the second half of the film not as good as the first.
For those animation junkies out there, the movie is still undoubtedly cute.
Expectations should be lower than  they would be when seeing the next new Pixar film. Just go in thinking you are going to see a happy-go-lucky children’s film and the night will not go to waste.

Every spring, the candidates for Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president make the same promises.
To some extent, that’s not a bad thing. These promises, for the most part, reflect student concerns.
But there is value, too, in looking at the long-term development of the university and student life.
Small, achievable goals are important, but it is just as critical to acknowledge that many of USG’s goals cannot be accomplished in one year and to begin planning for the years to come.
That is why the Daily Trojan editorial board is endorsing Eric Burse and Andy Greos for USG president and vice president.
Burse and Greos intend to develop a 10-year plan outlining how USG should move forward in the long run.
They anticipate the plan will include goals such as adding a fall break to the calendar and introducing a Trojan Grounds to the west side of campus. Goals like these are traditionally passed from one USG administration to the next, but Burse and Greos don’t plan to just continue the conversation ­— they plan to lay out concrete steps for future administrations.
Burse and Greos also want to add a Community Service Assembly to Program Board, offer free LSAT and MCAT prep classes and guarantee funding annually for traditional events, like Dance Marathon. These goals are ambitious, but that ambition is refreshing.
The editorial board was also considerably impressed with the platform presented by Monish Tyagi and Logan Lachman. Tyagi and Lachman want to extend the hours of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and get the shops at Tuscany and Gateway to accept discretionary dollars, among other goals. These are important, immediate issues, and Tyagi and Lachman are qualified to address them.
But Burse and Greos are the only candidates who are daring to look far beyond the immediate changes, and we would rather see an administration aim too high than not aim high enough.
We believe Burse and Greos have the ambition and the personalities necessary to achieve their goals, and though the results might not be as immediately evident, the long-term rewards will be great.

Mark,
I agree with some of what you’ve said. I generalized my entire comment to everyone who responded (which is never a good idea), particularly people who blatantly wrote uninformed, hostile comments towards Eric/Andy and ended their fragmented tirade with FADIL/MEHRA! without including their name.
But you know, you mentioned students, faculty, administrators, and staff all depend on the Daily Trojan (written by undergraduates) for their information on the election. I disagree. First of all, the only people who can vote in this election are undergrads so grad students, faculty, administrators, and staff are helpless in this election and more importantly (if i can generalize) don’t care. Ask any of your professors if they can name ONE candidate running for USG office.
Also, let’s keep in mind that the endorsement was written for the “Opinion” section of the DT. Not the news, which is the neutral reporting. The definition of opinion, is OPINION. You don’t have to agree with the DT, after all it is just their opinion. You seem to be well informed on the election as well as other public and national issues. You’re in the minority. A majority of this campus does not read the DT, and most especially not cover to cover. If they weren’t going to vote, an endorsement from a newspaper they don’t read isn’t going to swing the vote for them. 
Not only that, I find it really difficult to believe that someone who is well-informed about how other national newspapers work can draw a distinction between the Daily Trojan’s endorsement of a candidate and multiple national newspaper’s BLATANT endorsement of Obama this past election. Yes the Daily Trojan is the main newspaper of USC, but it is NOT the only one. Give more credit to the students, just because the Daily Trojan says they like one candidate does not necessarily mean that’s who students are mindlessly going to vote for. I like to think voters are informed enough to make their own decisions based on what the candidates stand for. I think the DT has done a fine job of covering ALL of the candidates and presenting them in a good light (ON THE FRONT PAGE).
And by the way, I did fully read your comment. “A person who won’t read has no advantage over one who can’t read.” But it seems as though you didn’t read mine. Your comment does not address my argument of the unfair practice of this election through the sanctions Monish received, the right of ANY/EVERY newspaper to have an editorial section, and the irrelevancy of making anonymous hate comments on Daily Trojan articles.
Lauren, 
You are no better than those who ended with “FADIL/MEHRA!” They mentioned that Eric/Andy’s answers were “naive” and “contradictory”. You flung back with how “Monish blatanly violating election rules” and how Eric/Andy’s signs were torn down. You are biased by your own viewpoints and clearly are not trying to stand on neutral ground and thus are no better than them.
I’m so glad that you brought up the fact that administrators, staff, grad students can’t vote. You know what I have to say to that? Who cares? That is not the point. The point is that MOST people on campus, students or faculty, read the Daily Trojan. My point was to show its prevalence on campus and how integral it is to our community. 
You claim that, “Yes the Daily Trojan is the main newspaper of USC, but it is NOT the only one.” By all means, try your very best to come up with a school publication that can rival Daily Trojan’s influence as a information source on campus. Yes, there are other publications on campus but most of these focus on a certain part of the campus life and do not have the breadth that the Daily Trojan offers. So, no, an opinion article written in those publications will not reach the eyes of the majority of USC students. There is absolutely no comparison to be made regarding the readership of the Daily Trojan and any other publication we have. 
Next you make the assumption that, “A majority of this campus does not read the DT, and most especially not cover to cover.” I certainly hope you are not a writer for the Daily Trojan because that is a sad declaration on your part. Take your own advice and “Give more credit to the students” whom you now claim don’t even bother to read the article. So which is it? Are the students “informed enough to make their own decisions based on what the candidates stand for” or are they part of the majority that does not read the Daily Trojan’s coverage of the elections? How can you say the voters are informed when you already claimed they don’t read the Daily Trojan?
The fact that you use the excuse that most people don’t read the opinion section of the Daily Trojan and therefore, won’t even have the opportunity to be swayed by the endorsement is quite ridiculous. That is insulting to the Daily Trojan itself to claim that the majority of the student population don’t read what they write. You are just making uneducated assumptions about the student body and clearly underestimating us as well as the Daily Trojan. 
Once again, stop bringing in real newspaper publications into this argument. I have already told you that the Daily Trojan has more influence on the information flow on this campus than any real major newspaper can ever hope for over the general population in the country. For every “liberal” publications that may have endorsed Obama, there are many “conservative” publications that would have vehemently denounced him. The fact of the matter is, USC does not have the same opportunities of a diverse display of opinions as the real world does. 
And lastly, I DID read your comment about the “unfair practice of this election through the sanctions Monish received” and disregarded it completely. That is why my comment did not address it. I am arguing for impartiality in the USG election coverage by the Daily Trojan because of its undeniable influence it has on our campus and on its voters. Whether or not Monish should have received a harsher punishment from USG is of no significance in this argument. 
Please take the time to actually think about the issue being discussed. Let me give you a clue, it is not about which candidate is better or who torn down whose poster or who wore his campaign shirt where. It’s a little bigger than that. 
“Get your facts first, then you can distort them as you please.” Mark Twain
Why its so hard to carry a neutral, intelligent discussion? Discussion here going to have no bearings on the current campaign. Its sort of lesson learned, or the observations from current election and discussing how it should be in future. But, like always some one who cant even understand the topic of discussion jumps in and try to mud the waters. Before you write (Lauren), try to read and more try to understand what some one is saying and what is the intent.
Mark, I think this discussion need to be continued even after elections, hopefully that would help next year and future election candidates. Daily Trojan is not in position of endorsing a campus student… period. If they do so, they are unduly influencing uninformed students.
Lauren, 
I am FULLY aware that major newspapers such as New York Times, Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle, etc. all endorse candidates. But as I said, “I realize that REAL newspapers do it too; however, in the real world, there are a multitude of news sources so we can seek a balanced viewpoint. At USC, we just have YOU, Daily Trojan.” 
Students, faculty, administrators and staff all rely on the Daily Trojan as the main, and oftentimes ONLY, comprehensive source of information on the happenings of our campus. This monopoly means that it cannot be compared to that of a real publication in the real world. I can read the editorial of the New York Times and the San Francisco Chronicle and get two opposing viewpoints. However, at USC, I can only read the Daily Trojan. 
By endorsing a candidate ticket, I feel as though Daily Trojan is playing a significant role in shifting the votes of the student body. I believe it should only serve as another medium through which candidates can reach out to their voters. I am not claiming that the Daily Trojan has not done a good job reporting on the election. However, but now that I know it endorsed Eric/Andy, I cannot help but think about what the Daily Trojan is choosing to focus on and what it is choosing to leave out. 
My comments do not have anything to do with the actions of the candidates, but rather, the actions of Daily Trojan. I actually have read all of the candidates’ platforms and the question/ answer portion for each ticket posted on the Daily Trojan website before posting my viewpoint. But once again, what the candidates stand for is  completely irrelevant when it comes to this issue of Daily Trojan’s endorsement of any candidate. Please, Lauren, don’t confuse the two. 
Lauren, did you even bother to read my comments? I understand that you are very passionate about the Eric/Andy ticket and rightfully so. I am part of USG and Program Board and understand the benefit of having experience in these two organizations for a presidential candidate. However, before you accuse me of being a “upset, biased Monish & Fahill supporter”, do realize I actually support Eric/Andy. Please, when you are making an argument, read through the other person’s words before you attack her. It only allows people to not take your comments seriously and makes ” it really hard not to laugh while reading”.
“A person who won’t read has no advantage over one who can’t read.” Mark Twain
It seems pretty clear to me that all of these screams about bias are comments are from upset, biased Monish & Fahill supporters. 
It is not just the Daily Trojan, but all major newspapers that have editorial sections that comment on a newspaper’s official opinion about any subject. Don’t believe me? Open the New York Times and read the Editorial section. (Is there a name next to that piece “Mark Twain”? Or do you need to look up what an “Editorial” is? Just reiterating, one person writes it and it is representative of the whole newspaper’s opinion.)
Please don’t undercut the Daily Trojan’s ability to gauge candidates. After all, I’m sure they’re the only one out of all of us who have done extensive interviews with all the candidates.
And if we want to talk about a change in a corrupt system, why don’t we talk about how all of Burse/Greos’s signs were ripped down by the 3rd day of campaigning while Monish & Fadil’s signs stayed pristine? Or why don’t we talk about the “punishment” for Monish blatanly violating election rules? 
I wish I could take these comments seriously, but it’s really hard not to laugh while reading about how the only two candidates who have experience on Program Board and directly in student life are “naive” and “contradictory”. Why don’t you re-read platforms and comment back with your real name?
First of all, learn how to spell the candidates names if you want anyone to take you seriously. Alex FADIL is running, not Fahill. And Monish & Logan’s signs were also destroyed last week, in case you were unaware. They had to come to campus early to salvage what was left. It’s a fact that Burse/Greos actually cheated by beginning their online campaign before midnight when the election period began, and the times were POSTED in the DT, but no one filed against them. 
No one is undermining DT’s ability to gauge candidates; people are just disappointed in the biased nature of the election coverage.
Oh, Lauren, I can’t forget the quote for you…
“A person who won’t read has no advantage over one who can’t read.” Mark Twain
I completely agree Mark’s comments. USC need to reconsider this practice of Daily Trojan endorsing election candidates. To a normal USC student, Daily Trojan is the voice of USC. Now for that student, if Daily Trojan endorses a candidate, then what is the point of having an election? Why even bother to vote?
Is this what USC wants to practice? Remember this is the single news place where a student turns to learn about the campus activities.
Besides endorsing, wish Daily Trojan could had stayed more neutral while reporting about the election events. But like i said at other place, in reporting Mehra’s complaint against Tyagi, Daily Trojan failed to keep its neutral stand…. (Just read the first paragraph)…
A sad moment for the USC Press !!
The Daily Trojan is supposed to be the main source of information about the USG Elections. It makes no sense to me that they would even endorse a candidate ticket. How can I trust that the Daily Trojan’s coverage of the debate and election happenings won’t be slated? How can you claim to fairly give all sides of the candidates’ goals and platforms to the student body for us to decide on one page but then publicly endorse a ticket on the next?  I realize that there are tons of other endorsements flying around by many student organizations. However, Daily Trojan is not just ANY student organization. It is the only organization that has the power to influence the knowledge of the ENTIRE student body. If it were just an opinion article with a writer’s name signed to it, it could be recognized as just one person’s point of view. But since it is published as an official endorsement by Daily Trojan, does it not equate as political propaganda? I realize that REAL newspapers do it too; however, in the real world, there are a multitude of news sources so we can seek a balanced viewpoint. At USC, we just have YOU, Daily Trojan. I also realize that this is in the opinion section. However, this was still written by the editors of Daily Trojan and implies that everyone beneath them (even the people reporting the news) agrees with this endorsement. At the end of the day, I feel that this unnecessarily undermines Daily Trojan’s credibility. 
“If you do not read the paper, you are not informed. If you do read the paper you will be misinformed.” Mark Twain
After thinking about thi even further, I now realize that this is exactly the type of internal bureaucracy that Fadil and Mehra are working against. It has become obvious to me that USG needs a change and that will come with the external ticket.
Fadil/ Mehra 2011!!!
Really? Andy and Eric are by far the least appropriate candidates. Their presentation at the debate was unprepared and contradictory and their platform points are essentially unachieveable. He promised subway taking USCard, but didn’t even talk to subway about making that happen? Fadil and Tyagi’s platforms are based on extensive research and planning while Eric’s is nothing more than the result of a simple brainstorming session based on naive assumptions.  I used to trust the DT’s endorsement, but this discredits a normally reliable source of information for me so much. I’m extremely disappointed.
