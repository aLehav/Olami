Finishing games strong is much more vital than starting games strong. 
USC lived by this narrative as it bested BYU, 91-84, in front of a crowd of approximately 8,000 at Staples Center Saturday as part of the Hoophall LA basketball showcase.  With the victory, the Trojans improved their regular season record to 8-0 — the best start to a season for the men’s basketball program since the 2000-2001 campaign. 
USC overcame a slow start against the Cougars (5-3) in the victory. Over the first six minutes of regulation, BYU jumped out to a 12-2 lead over the Trojans. USC opened the game by missing 16 of its first 17 field goal attempts shot 5.8 percent from field during BYU’s opening run. 
Following this opening stretch, USC finished the first half shooting 14-of-22 (63.6 percent) from the field. 
Overall, from when 14:01 remained in the first half all the way through the conclusion of regulation, the Trojans shot 29-of-49 (59.2 percent) from the floor as a team. 
The final three minutes of the first half saw USC go on a 16-5 run to enter the halftime break. That momentum carried over into the second half for the Trojans, as they opened the second period of play on a 14-5 run that lasted over four minutes. 
USC junior guard Jordan McLaughlin was named the Hoophall LA MVP of the game against the Cougars. 
McLaughlin — who recorded six rebounds and four assists Saturday — finished the contest with 24 points scored on 8-of-12 shooting from the field. 
“I just go with the flow of the game,” said McLaughlin, who scored 16 of his points in the second half against BYU. “If I’m open, I have the confidence to take that shot … we have confidence in all the guys on our team, and if I can make that shot it could get all of our guys going.”
Shaqquan Aaron, a redshirt sophomore guard for USC, totaled a career-high 19 points against BYU. USC’s scoring run in the first half was sparked by Aaron’s four three-point field goals made during the opening period of play. 
A total of five players scored in double-figures for USC Saturday: McLaughlin, Aaron, junior guard Elijah Stewart (scored 16 points), sophomore forward Chimezie Metu (12) and freshman guard De’Anthony Melton (12). 
Melton’s well-rounded performance against BYU saw him score 12 points, pull in a team-high eight rebounds and record a game-high six assists. He also blocked a shot and made two steals on defense against the Cougars. 
“For a freshman to come in like [Melton], he’s just college-ready,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “He’s just a good basketball player, he can do everything … what you’re seeing is a young man who is preparing himself mentally and physically to play well every night.”
With just over a minute remaining in regulation, USC had possession of the ball with BYU closing in on the Trojans’ 80-75 lead. That crucial possession concluded with a three-pointer from Melton that gave USC an 83-75 lead with 1:10 remaining in regulation — putting a serious dent in any comeback hopes which BYU may have had. 
In the first half, USC was 5-of-10 shooting from beyond the three-point arc; the Trojans finished the game 9-of-21 (42.9 percent) from three-point range. 
Throughout the game, USC made the most of its opportunities in transition. The Trojans outscored BYU on fast break opportunities, 12-6. USC also capitalized on the Cougars’ mistakes offensively, scoring 19 points off of BYU turnovers. 
A high-scoring second half saw USC and BYU match one another in points, 52-52. USC was 15-of-27 (55.6 percent) from the field in the second half; BYU shot 17-of-33 (51.5 percent) to finish the contest. 
BYU’s offensive presence down low (scored 48 points in the paint) put USC in foul trouble Saturday — both Metu and freshman forward Nick Rakocevic fouled out of the game.
“BYU challenged us because their perimeter players are so good and they have [forward Erik] Mika (who scored 29 points) inside who we couldn’t stop — he was getting fouls, scoring points,” Enfield said. “It wasn’t like we were perfect on defense   tonight … we have some things to work on, just like every other team does. ”
USC will return to the Galen Center on Dec. 11 to host Pepperdine (4-4) in its next non-conference matchup this season. With a win over the Waves, USC could clinch the best start to a season in program history since 1971, when the team started 16-0.

It took two minutes of Saturday’s semifinal game against Harvard for the Trojans to prove that they had come into this championship with one goal in mind — an NCAA trophy.
With the band booming and a crowd of fans decked out in crimson and gold, the Spieker Aquatics Complex in Berkeley, Calif. felt like a home game environment. And from the start, it wasn’t a question which team was dominant in the pool. 
After shutting out the Crimson in the first half, the Trojans earned a spot in their 12th-straight championship game with a 19-4 demolition of the less-experienced Harvard squad. The victory brought the Trojans to the game they’ve been preparing for since before this season even began.
“This was just a warm-up for tomorrow,” freshman driver Marin Dasic said. “Actually, the whole season was just warm-up for the game that is tomorrow.”
The game highlighted all of the Trojans’ strengths — stalwart defense anchored by junior McQuin Baron, a balanced, patient attack and aggressive performance in one-on-one situations.

For all four quarters, the Trojan defense smothered the Harvard attack, preventing the Crimson from creating any offensive rhythm. Each drive fell apart after several passes, and the Trojans excelled in snatching steals and forcing sloppy turnovers. 
When the Crimson did sneak in a shot, Baron was there to make the save, a persistent presence on the end-line that kept Harvard scoreless for the first half of play. 
Freshman Simon Wu subbed in for Baron in the second half, getting valuable minutes in a semifinal game and holding Harvard to four goals. His defense remained aggressive in their coverage, forcing passes to fly high and swatting down shots.
The Trojans were just as aggressive on the offense, offering a well-balanced attack that saw 11 players find the back of the net. The first three goals came from freshmen, showing the strength of the team’s freshman unit, with freshman driver Thomas Dunstan notching three goals.
For head coach Jovan Vavic, the ability of players of any age or position to score is the backbone of this year’s success.
“That’s been our strength all season,” Vavic said. “We really don’t have just one player who a team can say, ‘If we stop this guy we beat them.’ It’s nice to see that. It’s good for our team, for our chemistry.”

After the semifinal win, the build up to the championship game on Sunday is a familiar position for the Trojans. But though the program has seen eight national titles over the past 11 years, the last two years have ended in losses to UCLA. 
Senior Nick Bell is the only player remaining on the team who holds the status of an NCAA champion. But two back-to-back championship losses to the team’s biggest rival won’t slow down this Trojan squad. It’s only making them hungrier for a win on Sunday.
“We’ve come into this whole tournament for the past two weeks thinking that we just want to play our best water polo for two games,” junior utility James Walters said. “The excitement is crazy right now. The whole team, we’re incredibly excited. We’re just ready to play this last game.”

The suspect in the killing of USC professor Bosco Tjan has been identified as 28-year-old David Jonathan Brown, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. 
Brown, a graduate student earning his doctorate in neuroscience at USC, was taken into custody after police responded to the 10th floor of the Seeley G. Mudd building at approximately 4:35 p.m. Friday night. Tjan, a psychology professor and the co-director of the Dornsife Cognitive Neuroscience Imaging Center, was stabbed multiple times, according to police. 
LAPD officials have not yet released a motive for the attack, though they said it was not random and resulted from a “personal dispute.” Brown, a Los Angeles resident, is being held on $1 million bail. It is unclear what relationship he had to Tjan, though records show Brown was also a teaching assistant in the department of biological sciences at USC. 
My condolences to Dr. Tjan’s family and the USC community.

As both teams trudged off the field after the first half of the NCAA semifinal in Avaya Stadium on Friday, the Trojans looked as if they might be facing the end of their run in the tourney.
From the start, Georgetown possessed. In the first seconds of the game, a forward took a hard shot that barely went wide and into the side netting. The tone was set from there. With well-structured attacks and an uptempo pace, the Hoyas put the Trojans back on their heels. 
The stat card reflected the frustration of the half — the Trojans earned six fouls and took only one shot. Georgetown, meanwhile, leveled five shots at goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme, forcing her to make sliding saves off her line to keep the Trojans alive.
But in the locker room, head coach Keidane McAlpine told his players to do one thing — breathe.
“We were on our back foot for most of the first half,” McAlpine said. “Second half, we caught our breath and found a way to get back in the game.”
Maybe it was a rousing halftime speech, or endurance, or just the sheer chemistry of the team. But in the second half, the Trojans exploded with their typical intensity, spreading the field wide and carving up the Georgetown defense. 
The increase in energy made the difference as USC went on to win 1-0, advancing to the College Cup final for the first time since the program won it all in 2007. The Trojans will face West Virginia for the championship on Sunday. 
It wasn’t a dominant second half for either team. But the Trojans began to string together set pieces and thoughtful attacks, maintaining long chunks of possession that provided movement and allowed flank players to stretch the field. All that USC needed was one moment to change the course of the game.
That spark came in the 59th minute, when senior midfielder Morgan Andrews passed a ball from the right flank to Johnson, who had backed her defender up only feet away from the goal. Redshirt senior forward Johnson took a touch to her right, turned and slotted a shot into the left corner. The ball flew too wide and low for the keeper to ever have a chance at making the save.
It happened so fast that Johnson, laughing, admitted afterwards that she couldn’t remember much of the play herself. But with 20 minutes left in the game, the Trojans took a lead that they held steadily until the final whistle.
The lead put the Trojans back in control, a position they’ve become comfortable in throughout this season. This USC squad isn’t used to losing — after dropping its first two games of the season, the Trojans made a decision as a team to relentlessly refuse to accept anything besides victory.
Since then, they lost only two and tied two more, with Prudhomme setting the school record for shutouts on her way to becoming Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Year. In most of those games, the front line crafted a dominant style of play that kept defenses on their heels and the ball far from Prudhomme’s line.
That wasn’t the case with Georgetown. Even after scoring their goal, the game remained back and forth at a brutal pace that forced both defenses to remain constantly on edge. But that brought out another edge of the USC team that has quietly aided this year’s high-scoring success — the wealth of talent in the backline.
The defense-focused game showcased Prudhomme and senior Pac-12 Defender of the Year Mandy Freeman. The pair slowed a Georgetown attack carrying all of the game’s momentum into the second half, disrupting passes and minimizing time spent in the goal box. And even into the final seconds, the senior leaders made sure their voices were heard as they rallied their defense to maintain the shut out.
“We played all the way to the last second,” Prudhomme said. “We didn’t want anyone losing their head for a minute, so for me I’m just constantly reassuring them that I’m behind them. You get caught up in a game, you just gotta keep talking.”
If past games are anything to go by, Sunday’s championship game against West Virginia will be similarly focused. The last six games of the tourney have ended in 1-0 scoresheets, including West Virginia’s late win over North Carolina earlier on Friday.
But if Sunday comes down to a battle of defenses, the Trojans can be confident in one thing — they’ll bring one of the best in the country to the field.
