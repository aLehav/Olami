Alicia Lu, a member of the Steering Committee of What Matters to Me and Why, a program that fosters dialogue of beliefs and principles,  led a discussion in Taper Hall last night about the issues raised from the viral Kappa Sigma email, which has sparked controversy because it defined women in derogatory terms.
More than 20 undergraduate and graduate students attended the meeting to discuss ways to start a broader dialogue about sexual violence, misogyny and the university’s handling of the situation.
Corey Arterian, a senior majoring in English, said she was very happy with the turn out at the discussion.
“It was an equal mix of men and women,” Arterian said. “It makes me so happy as a woman on this campus to see so many men supporting this.”
Arterian said the group that met is still in its early stages, and students are deciding if the group should have a name and when the next meeting will be.
“This is about starting the conversation to facilitate more conversation and change on campus,” Arterian said. “We really just talked about how this email made us feel, what problems it indicates and how we can potentially help fix this problem.”
Kappa Sigma Fraternity released an official press statement Tuesday, denying that Mitchell Wilson, Kappa Sigma International Headquarter’s Executive Director, or any member of the Kappa Sigma Headquarters staff met with an anonymous female blogger, who insists she was ordered by Mitchell and others from Kappa Sigma not to speak to the Daily Trojan.
The blogger claims in the email to Jezebel that she was present when her roommate edited the viral Kappa Sigma email that has stirred controversy around campus.
The statement also said that Kappa Sigma would never tamper with an ongoing investigation.
“We would never allow any of our members to conceal any truths or impede the investigation, which we are conducting as expeditiously as possible,” Mitchell said. “Anyone who would believe otherwise is misguided and understands nothing about the nature of our organization.”
Mitchell also promised to continue the investigation into the origin of the email, and ensured that the writer of the email would be held accountable when discovered.
yeah, its not about being Greek. Get over yourselves. It’s about being sexist (also, get over yourselves).
sorry for partying
It is shameful to see a petition signed by so many students and faculty regarding a rumor.  An anonymous blog post on a feminist site sparked a revolution?  If she was so certain about her knowledge, why did she not also give her full name?  Since when did Jezebel and blogging become a credible source for information? 
And seriously, what do you expect the University to do?  Last time I checked, we have rights in our constitution which allow for freedom of speech.  This blogger however has libeled an individual on the internet, which I see as a much bigger issue.  Why are we not investigating this blogger?  For she is actually committing a crime.  
Go hold your meetings, I encourage healthy discussion.  However, I must say I feel extremely comfortable being a woman at USC.  I have never felt pressured sexually or socially as a USC female at this school.  I don’t know many who have.    Please stop the allegations towards our University, it is embarrassing.  Stop bring USC’s community down.  120 vs. 40,000.
No one is currently in jail for libel sweetie!
Libel is not a crime!  It’s a civil matter you stupid sorority ho!
Time to let this go people.  The conspiracy theories out there make you guys and gals sound like nut bags!  USC has already determined not was wrong here but poor control of email lists.  Last time I looked that isn’t a crime yet.
I was there and the meeting boasted more than 20 participants from all stripes — not just grad students, though a handful of grad students were in attendance. The students were articulate and maturely discussed the email and greater safety issues on campus. The biggest theme is the lack of transparency in the school’s investigation thus far, which needs to change for this issue to “go away” as it seems some administration officials would like. This email represents a good opportunity for USC to have a broader dialogue about rape and USC’s often misogynistic Greek culture. And the group does have a name: The Coalition for a Safer Campus and Community will next meet on Tuesday, March 29 at 8 p.m. in THH 113. Join the dialogue!
‘Only’ twenty people showed up because it was a meeting only for people most dedicated to taking leadership on this issue. It was a first action planning meeting, not a general forum–which we should have and which I am sure many more people will attend.
Hum, except the meeting was widely advertised in advance in the DT.  
In any event, did you also discuss due process during that meeting, or only how to create a hostile environment for greeks in the classroom by having activist TAs assert the guilt of people whose “guilt” is only “proved” by an anonymous blogger alleging that her roommate told her that…
After all this fuss, only 20 people showed up.  This goes to show that this buzz was organized by a tiny minority of grad students (from english, gender, american studies and comm in particular) who blew things completely out of proportion when they claimed that their students got traumatized by the email.  What the university now really needs to investigate is whether it was proper for these grad students to file complaints against kappa sig with the sexual harassment office (which they did) and go on a witch-hunt, as they did.
signed: “anonymous female blogger” — see irony as you see fit
You should be ashamed!
I just want people to know I attended last night’s meeting because my girlfriend made me go.  I would have never gone on my own.  Nevertheless I felt I learned something despite the threat of her withholding sex if I didn’t go.
Thite, dude, you’ve got to stop letting your girlfriend treat you like an object.  next thing you know, she’ll be emailing all her friends about her exploits!
Thite:  I hope you got a piece of pie that night

Graduate students Evan Jones and Charles Rubinoff created USC for Japan in an effort to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami.
Jones and Rubinoff were at lunch when the earthquake hit Japan, and their Japanese American cashier overheard their conversation about the earthquake. He interjected saying that he was worried about his family in Japan because he was unsure if they were safe. The two told him about the Google Person Finder, which is an application that helps people report and find missing people because of national disasters. They realized others might need help finding resources.
Soon after, Jones and Rubinoff set up uscforjapan.com and a related Twitter account and Facebook page to link people to informational and aid websites about the earthquake and tsunami.
“USC for Japan is trying to galvanize the USC community to action with regard to helping disaster victims,” Jones wrote in an email. “We’re dedicated to letting people know about how they can aid earthquake victims. We want to let our community be aware that we can do something besides just worrying.”
Though USC for Japan is not collecting any donations itself, it hopes to point potential donors to reputable charities and trusted organizations such as Doctors Without Borders, Relief International and AmeriCares.
In addition, the sites also post news updates and provide links to pertinent tools such as the YouTube CitizenTube site, where several Japanese citizens have uploaded footage of their own experiences in the earthquake or tsunami.
“If you have family in Japan, there are great tools that you can use to find or contact people. In fact, a lot of companies are even letting people call Japan for free now,” Jones wrote.
USC for Japan also encourages students and members of the Trojan family to post pertinent fundraising events and opportunities on their Facebook page.
In addition to the efforts of USC for Japan, the USC Office of Religious Life and the Japanese Student Association will be accepting donations on behalf of the Red Cross and Oxfam International.
Christina Zdawczyk, a freshman majoring in neuroscience and secretary of JSA, said JSA will be tabling on Trousdale Parkway this week and next week to collect donations on behalf of the Red Cross Los Angeles Region.
“We’ll be taking donations and having people sign messages of hope on origami paper that will be made into paper cranes,” Zdawczyk said. “Our goal is 1,000 paper cranes, and if you fold 1,000 paper cranes, you get one wish granted. We’re hoping that we’ll get our wish granted that Japan gets through this disaster.”
The USC Global Health Student Club will also be holding a fundraiser with 100 percent of the proceeds going toward disaster relief.
Chelsea Messinger, a freshman majoring in global health and the public relations chair of the Global Health Student Club, said the club will be tabling on Trousdale next week with red and white ribbons. Students who donate money will receive a ribbon to raise awareness of the help Japan needs.

Perhaps no one put it better than USC baseball’s interim coach, Frank Cruz: “The better team won today,” Cruz said, following the Trojans’ 5-2 loss to UC Santa Barbara.
Daily Trojan
It was the Trojans’ first chance to avenge a midweek loss, as the Gauchos beat the Trojans 3-2 in Santa Barbara previously this month.
The Gauchos got on top right away. With two on and one down in the first, cleanup hitter Mark Haddow ripped a two-RBI double into the gap in left center.
USC got a run back in the second. Sophomore right fielder Alex Glenn was hit by a pitch with one out and went to third on a single to right by sophomore third baseman Adam Landecker.
With two down, junior catcher Kevin Roundtree delivered the clutch knock through the right side to plate Glenn for his first RBI of the year.
Junior starter Ben Mount got tagged with another pair in the third, again by Haddow.
It was another shot to left center, but this one went over the fence for a two-run homer to put the Gauchos up 4-1, and Mount was lifted from the game after going just two and two-thirds innings, allowing four earned runs, and raising his season ERA from 1.10 to 2.84.
Junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa led off with a double in the fourth.
He advanced to third on a groundout and scored on a single by junior designated hitter Brandon Garcia, but that was it for the Trojans in that inning.
All told, USC left seven runners on base in the first four innings, including runners in scoring position in the first, third and fourth.
The Trojans have left nearly eight men per game on base in their 21 games this season.
“We gotta start putting the bat on the ball with runners on,” Cruz said. “Maybe be a little more aggressive. But we gotta get that done.”
UCSB also made a pitching change after the third, and new pitcher Nick Capito delivered three scoreless innings.
He was matched by freshman reliever Kyle Richter, who retired the Gauchos in order in the fourth and fifth and got the first two in the sixth before he was pulled after three of his own shutout innings.
“Richter was a bright spot,” Cruz said. “One of the few.”
Back-to-back singles by freshman shortstop James Roberts and Oropesa put a pair on in the Trojans’ half of the seventh. A steal put runners at second and third with two down for Garcia.
After falling behind 0-2, he worked it to 2-2 before UCSB made a pitching change. Cruz countered with junior pinch hitter Mike Greco.
So brand new Gaucho pitcher Connor Whalen prepared to throw his first pitch of the game to Greco, the brand-new Trojan hitter, with a 2-2 count.
After taking a ball to work the count full, Greco took a fastball on the outside corner for strike three.
USC put two on again in both the eighth and ninth, but couldn’t get the runners home either time to finish with 13 left on for the game.
“We’re trying to do a little too much right now,” Oropesa said. “We just gotta drive it hard. As a hitter you just gotta get your pitch and hit it hard. That’s all you can do.”
The Trojans will begin a weekend series at home Friday when UCLA comes to Dedeaux Field for three games. USC most recently beat the Bruins 2-0 on March 13 in a nonconference game at Dodger Stadium as a part of the Dodgertown Classic.
Cruz forgot to mention that the UCSB  head coach managed better, also. Great strategy bringing in a pinch hitter having two strikes against him before he sees a pitch in a clutch situation. This coach over manages time and again.
The season could be over for all intent and purposes if the Trojans lose two of three or get swept this weekend by the ‘ruins.

The boys of fall are back.
Nearly four months removed from an 8-5 season, the program’s worst mark since 2001, USC returned to the field early Tuesday morning for the first of 15 spring practices. And by early, try 7:25 a.m.
Leadership · Starting with spring practice, junior quarterback Matt Barkley will look to get the Trojans headed in the right direction. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“Meetings were a little slow; guys were a little tired,” said junior quarterback Matt Barkley. “We’re just getting used to it. The tempo should be better in the days to come.”
Despite not practicing since early December, 19 players were sidelined from Tuesday’s session at Cromwell Field and listed for “no contact.” Many of them, such as junior linebacker Devon Kennard and redshirt freshman wide receiver Kyle Prater, were still recovering from offseason surgeries.
Combine various ailments with NCAA-levied sanctions, and the Trojans’ depth chart is thin, particularly on the offensive line, where there are just “six or seven” healthy linemen, according to USC coach Lane Kiffin.
“You probably noticed,” he said of the team’s nagging depth issues. “The scary thing is, we’re 19 short and we just started. Usually you’re short at the end of spring. Hopefully we don’t add to that list, and possibly get some guys back.”
With declining numbers, Kiffin and his staff resorted to more seven-on-seven drills as opposed to simply 11-on-11s.
But over the course of the two-hour practice, the Trojans’ injury issues worsened, as senior tailback Marc Tyler pulled his right hamstring while running a pass route, causing him to miss the remainder of the practice.

“He’s going to be treated day-to-day,” Kiffin said. “He just pulled his hamstring. We don’t know how severe it is yet.”
–
Many younger players also got reps Tuesday, even at the quarterback position where Barkley is a lock to start the team’s Sept. 3 season opener against Minnesota.
Three freshmen — Cody Kessler, Jesse Scroggins and Max Wittek, none of whom have taken a collegiate snap — all saw significant reps at quarterback as they vie to become the team’s No. 2 signal caller come fall. The winner of the competition, according to Kiffin, will be the one who makes the fewest mistakes.
“You’re not looking for the guy to have a 400-yard passing game,” Kiffin said. “He’s not going to get a lot of reps during the week in preparation, so he’s going to be a guy who approaches the game very seriously. He has to be a guy who can go in there at any time and run the offense.”
Additionally, redshirt freshman tailback D.J. Morgan, who missed all of last season following surgery to repair a torn ACL, showed flashes of the speed said to make him a candidate to crack the team’s backfield rotation.
“He’s a good player,” Barkley said with a grin. “He’s developing into a good running back. He’s just got to get the mental side of the game down like all the other guys do.”
–
The Trojans won’t be afforded much rest in the coming weeks, as Kiffin expects the team to partake in tackling drills, possibly as soon as Thursday, despite fewer bodies.
“We’re going to have to, especially in the spring, this far away from an actual game,” Kiffin said. “Obviously when you tackle you get some guys banged up. So even if that happens, hopefully we’ll get them back before we get into the fall.”
Defense, particularly tackling, has remained a primary concern for Kiffin’s staff. A season ago, the Trojans surrendered 400 yards and 26.7 points per contest and did not hold any tackling drills during the fall.
“We had so many missed tackles last year,” Kiffin said. “It cost us a lot, so that needs work.”
Lets Go Trojans! If we get a favorable decision from the NCAA of the appeal…GAME ON FOR ALL THE MARBLES!!
FIGHT ON!!

It took an impromptu conversation at an airport bar for me to discover what makes every March so magical for college students across the country when the NCAA tournament rolls around.
This weekend’s Florida-UCLA game was by no means compelling, jump-off-your-couch television, but its lead changes, hard-nosed defensive plays and tempo shifts had me entertained while waiting for my flight back to Los Angeles.
A deep three-pointer by the Gators’ junior guard Erving Walker put the game out of reach, and just as Billy Donovan was about to stamp his fourth career Sweet 16 ticket, I heard a dejected voice say, “I miss the days when this was my tournament.”
I turned back to find a man standing with a bittersweet grin on his face as the final moments of the game wound down.
I was intrigued, and posed a simple question: “What do you mean, ‘When this was your tournament?’”
Expecting him to be turned off by my rather brash inquiry, I remained silent for a few moments.
What ensued was a conversation that shed light on the juvenile yet magical allure of the Big Dance.
The man turned out to be a former player who was part of one of the largest upsets in college basketball history, when Coppin State, as the No. 15 seed, knocked off the No. 2 seeded South Carolina Gamecocks in 1997.
He told me that in the 14 years since the annual dance has slowly become someone else’s tournament.
The tournament, in his words, “is not as relatable to people my age, because it’s symbolic of the innocence and ambition of youth.”
This idea surprised me, given the widespread popularity of college’s postseason party. But after several more hours of watching the madness unfold this weekend, I came to realize his preposterous claim had substance.
I’ll admit, in terms of top-notch basketball, the NBA is the place to turn.
In an offensive-geared league that doesn’t rely on shortened three-point arcs, defensive schemes like the 2-3 zone or the full court trap would be laughed at.
Sure, it could work in small doses, but let’s see Jim Boeheim or Bob Huggins run a zone for 82 nights a year.
Outside of this, it makes complete sense that college basketball has a captivating power over college students.
Besides the fact the games are tailored to our shorter attention spans, the real excitement stems from our ability to directly relate with the jovial, yet at times heartbreaking, tone of the tournament.
It’s our peers and fellow bracket busters.
It’s our universities being showcased to a national audience, even if just for one night in Dayton, Ohio.
For one month, our struggles and unrealized journeys are played out metaphorically on the court.
And it’s this authentic representation of the college experience, one borne out of amateurish naivety and passion, that students connect with in a way others simply cannot.
One day, when you’re sitting in an airport bar waiting for your flight, an NCAA tournament game might come on, bringing you back to all of the memories you have of watching the unscripted drama unfold during your college years.
Do you really want to be the fan who looks back in regret for failing to recognize how beautiful it was to have an experience to call your own?
I sure hope not.

The USC women’s basketball team is enjoying unprecedented success in the Women’s National Invitation Tournament this postseason. The Women of Troy will be playing in the tournament’s third round for the first time in school history.
Consumate teammate · Despite starting almost all season, junior guard Ashley Corral has come off the bench the first two games of the WNIT. She has still provided a huge lift for USC, however, leading the team with a combined 35 points in the two games. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
To continue its successful run, USC (21-12) will need to defeat BYU, the regular season champions of the Mountain West conference.
Despite a strong 23-8 record during the regular season and a 12-game winning streak heading into the Mountain West tournament, the Cougars (25-8) were denied a spot in the NCAA tournament after losing in the semifinals of their conference tournament to in-state rival Utah.
Since then, BYU has gone on a tear through the WNIT.
The Cougars made quick work of their first two opponents, beating Denver 75-60 and ripping another in-state rival, Utah State, 102-63. The 39-point margin of victory in their second-round game is the largest of any game in the WNIT so far.
“They’re a good outside shooting team, and they execute well,” said senior guard Jacki Gemelos.
The Women of Troy, however, have reason to believe they can advance to the quarterfinals, and perhaps even further.
After junior guard Ashley Corral returned from a two-game suspension for violating team rules, USC coach Michael Cooper made a lineup change that moved the sharpshooter to a sixth man-type role. The adjustment seems to have sparked the team’s offense.
“[The lineup change] is what’s best for the team,” Corral said. “We’re winning and playing great basketball right now.”
Corral has settled nicely into her new role, converting 8-of-9 three-point attempts in the WNIT. She leads the team with 35 points in the two tournament games.
“I do think [the line-up change] has helped my shooting a lot, and hopefully that’ll keep going,” Corral said.
For the season, she is second on the team in scoring with 12.3 points per game and leads the team with 3.7 assists per contest.
Gemelos, who has taken over as the primary point guard, is close behind with 12 points and 2.6 assists per game.
“[Point guard] is where I’m most comfortable at,” Gemelos said. “I’ve played point guard my whole life. It’s different from last year and most of this year, but it’s definitely been a good transition for me.”
Junior guard Briana Gilbreath leads the Women of Troy in scoring and rebounding, averaging 14.7 points and 7.3 rebounds.
The Women of Troy will need Gilbreath and her teammates in the frontcourt to continue their success on the boards, as the Cougars will provide a formidable challenge down low.
“They rebound well, [especially] offensive rebounding,” Gemelos said. “I think our game plan, like it is every game, is to outrebound the other team.”
When USC does this, the team is 14-1.
Forward Coriann Fraughton is the Cougars’ main force on the boards with a team-high 7.4 rebounds per game, and is second in scoring with 11.7 points per contest. Guard Mindy Bonham leads BYU in points and assists, averaging 12.8 and 5.1, respectively.
But USC seems to be playing its best basketball of the season, and the team is coming off of arguably their best game of the season, a 78-59 romp over Nevada while overcoming a raucous pro-Nevada crowd.
“Everything just clicked,” Corral said. “We all played really well together and we played as a team. They might not have been cheering for us, but it’s always nice to show the crowd up.”
The Cougars will likely boast the advantage of a big home crowd, too.
“There have been some situations where we’ve played in front of a big crowd and we haven’t shown up,” Corral said. “But right now, we know what we have to do. We can’t focus [on the crowd]. We have to win games. [In the postseason], you win or you’re done.”

Looking back on the very drama-filled past of Dance Gavin Dance, it’s impressive to see the group managed to release a cohesive new album. But that’s exactly what Downtown Battle Mountain II is.
The lineup of the Sacramento, Calif. post-hardcore band has changed so many times it’s been difficult to keep up with who’s still part of the group.
Happily ever after · After a lot of lineup changes, it seems the guys of Dance Gavin Dance have finally settled on a solid team. The band’s newest album, Downtown Battle Mountain II, showcases the harmonious vocals of the two lead singers and the funkier side of the instrumentalists. - Photo courtesy of Earshot Media  
When vocalist Jonny Craig left the group in 2007 and Jon Mess, the scream vocalist, left in 2008, DGD’s sound was slightly altered.
The band’s third album, Happiness, featured fewer screaming vocals and sounded more like experimental rock than pure post-hardcore music.
After the departure of singer Kurt Travis and guitarist Zac Garren, Mess and Eric Lodge, a former bassist, rejoined.
Craig had initially been turned away when he asked to rejoin in 2007, but he was welcomed back to the band in 2010.
The reunion of the original members, minus Sean O’ Sullivan, called for a sequel to Downtown Battle Mountain, DGD’s 2007 full-length release.
Its latest, Downtown Battle Mountain II, unites the sounds of some of the band’s previous albums.
“Spooks,” the opening track, is classic DGD. It begins with a clear-cut guitar melody, and Craig’s vocals float along with it.
Suddenly it jumps into a more aggressive mode and Mess’ distressed screams take the song in a completely different direction.
Fortunately, his technique isn’t overwhelming.
He is screaming, but not to the point where it is the type of high-pitched screeching or deep growling commonly heard from other hardcore bands.
The screaming sounds hectic, yet Mess also show control over his voice.
In songs like “Pounce Bounce,” “Need Money” and “The Robot With Human Hair Pt. 2 1/2,” the lyrics are, surprisingly, fairly audible.
There are moments when the average listener might ask if Mess is actually saying anything or just making loud noises, but only a few.
Craig’s style is very different. When Craig’s heard singing alone, he could almost be mistaken for an R&B singer, not a member of a hardcore band.
He has a smooth, soulful tone, which is especially evident in the song “Blue Dream.”
The way his voice soars and then fades adds a fresh level of depth to tracks including “Swan Soup” and “Purple Reign.”
Mess and Craig do a great job of balancing their vocal harmonies. Their yin-and-yang essences complement each other, providing a nice texture for the arrangements.
Downtown Battle Mountain II does have rapid movement and the traditional gut-wrenching metal chords, but also contains a refreshing grooviness.
The guitar riffs played by Will Swan display his diverse musicality and knowledge of various genres and techniques.
In “Blue Dream” and “Privilously Poncheesied,” Swan, bassist Eric Lodge and drummer Matt Mingus even slip in a few bars of dance-worthy funk.
There is no doubt Swan, who has been in DGD since day one, is a skilled guitarist.
The volume level of his guitar on Downtown II is almost at the same level as Craig and Mess’ vocals, as if his guitar is a third vocalist.
Usually, that could get annoying or overbearing, but the tone and intricacy of his riffs are too interesting to ignore.
When Craig is belting out harmonies and Mess is screaming in the background, it’s nice to sit back and listen to Swan take over for a bit.
There is no denying DGD’s ability to shape a very distinct sound that dabbles in metal and R&B.
It is unfortunate the drama surrounding the band has in a way overshadowed its music. But Downtown II is far from disappointing and deserves to be given a chance. Hopefully this energy will keep up as the band tours the United States and Europe this spring, including a performance in this summer’s Warped Tour.

By now you’ve probably heard about Rebecca Black, the new teen pop singer who’s been terrorizing the Internet with her auto-tuned, android-like voice on the relentlessly mocked viral video for her song “Friday.”
I’ve been doing my best to refrain from chiming in with my own opinion on the singer, mainly, since my opinion greatly differs from the resounding negative criticism the singer has received.
Yes, I’m somewhat ashamed to admit it, but Rebecca Black is not that bad. Relatively, at least.
If for some reason you haven’t heard of Rebecca Black, she’s a young teen pop singer who suddenly rose to internet fame after the release of her video “Friday,” in which she sings what many have criticized as dumb, senseless lyrics over a simple pop beat.
Some initially thought the song was a joke or parody, but further investigation revealed the video was released by Ark Music Factory, a company that produces videos for similar, unknown teen pop artists.
It’s true, Rebecca Black is terrible. Her voice and lyrics like Yesterday was Thursday, today it is Friday / We so excited we’re gonna have a ball today / Tomorrow is Saturday and Sunday comes afterwards are cringe-inducing and sadly hilarious.
Needless to say, Rebecca Black hasn’t exactly written the next “Imagine.”
She has, however, written a modern pop song. Admittedly, her chorus of It’s Friday, it’s Friday and Fun, fun, fun, fun isn’t what most would consider lyrical poeticism, but it’s not far from the mainstream pop songs being produced.
Singers like Ke$ha, Miley Cyrus and the elder crew (Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, etc.) have been crafting pop songs with simple yet catchy lyrics for years, and, although they’re not necessarily music snobs’ artists of choice, they haven’t caused the same uproar as Rebecca Black.
I found myself laughing and shaking my head at some of the lines in the song, but I couldn’t help but realize many songs on Top 40 radio are not that different.
Black’s lyrics aren’t even that far from older, more respected pop songs. Fun, fun, fun, ’til her daddy takes the T-bird away is not that different from It’s Friday, it’s Friday … Fun, fun, fun.
If it’s Black’s lack of guitars and heavy use of auto-tune and simple electronic pop beats that’s making her such a mockery, that’s one thing.
But why choose Black to mock when others are doing the same thing and have been for more than a decade?
It’s hard to understand why there’s such a fuss over this particular video. Yes, the lyrics are horrible and her voice is awful, but it’s no more ridiculous than any other teen pop song. It’s simple and over-worked, yet catchy in its own, strange way.
There are actually some people on the Internet who are standing up for Black. On Rolling Stone’s website, Matthew Perpetua wrote an article entitled “Why Rebecca Black’s Much-Mocked Viral Hit ‘Friday’ Is Actually Good.”
Perpetua makes statements such as, “[Black] sounds like anything else in pop music,” and “[the lyrics] may not seem as ridiculous if, say, Katy Perry was singing instead.”
Though Perpetua generally pans the song in the rest of the article, he still maintains that it’s fairly similar to many other songs that proved popular.
Perpetua also makes a good point of calling into question the nature of pop, saying “Black and Ark Music Factory have made a video that forces its audience to reckon with a particular formula for pop music.”
Hopefully he’s right, and Black’s song will change the public’s opinion of pop’s simplistic, over-effected formula.
It’s more likely, however, the song will simply entertain Internet meme followers and then fade out of public consciousness.
But the amount of negative attention given to the video is undeserved. Black is dealing with it well, as she largely shrugged off the negative comments on her appearance on Good Morning America, and didn’t do so bad on an a capella rendition of the national anthem and an acoustic version of “Friday” during the segment.
If “Friday” has caused such an uproar, people need to start looking at the pop genre as a whole.

Rebecca Black is an awesome roll model for young girls. The public took a single negative connotation and ran with it. I love this girl!! She is sweet as can be in her interviews. Jealously reigns with all these young adults out there looking for youtube fame themselves by posting a terrible cover performance of some song from of there PC cameras.
“….. is an awesome roll model for young girls.”—- role*
Roll = directional mobility
Role = status or social position
I disagree with you chastising other youth for attempting cover songs. Especially since, Rebecca, couldn’t even cover her own song on the Tonight Show…….
Rebecca is a 13 year old girl, who, it turns out, has a voice on her that’s as passable as any other teen artist on a major label today. The problem is with the song…which she didn’t write. Along with the video, the writing and production was the work of Ark Music factory, a couple of guys, who, if they were honest, have not had the kind of career in the music business that they would have hoped for…and simply became very lazy in the songwriting department. Super-lazy, in fact. Have a go at them, leave Rebecca alone.
umm I disagree …
In my opinion the backlash is more focused on the idea that if you want something bad enough you only need to do it once and then you’re a star, right? It’s the whole American Idol culture that has pervaded our society that you don’t have to be good at something–you just *gulp* have ta want it bad enough!!!
Wanting it badly is NOT enough and people who have money to throw at projects like this often haven’t invested the time it takes to become, uhhh, actually GOOD. The stars she emulates get just as much criticism, but unfortunately for us (and fortunately for her) they pander to the lowest common denominator of taste.
We’re as sick of people like Rebecca and the stars she emulates as we are of advertising. It’s invasive and it’s trash. It demands to be loved and paid attention and we’re tired of it. We being people who care what goes in their ears, eyes and mouth. Sick of crappy music, food and aggressive advertising.
Bottom line is you’re talking about/to the people who are already aggressively against the pop genre as a whole. We’re already doing what we should–being vocal, not buying/listening. But just like people who love good TV but haven’t been assigned a Nielson Box–we have NO say in this. This is the fault of the masses who will buy this crap in droves.

French film director and screenwriter François Ozon proffers a satirically hilarious look at the life of a “potiche” (trophy wife) in his adaptation of the hit comic play of that same name.
Ozon’s Potiche takes Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Grédy’s original play and turns it into his own modern work of art while successfully maintaining the verve of the story’s originial 1970s location.
Happy family · Potiche presents a unique family, relying on the complicated relationships of the eccentric characters. Though it is not a musical, the songs the film includes help develop the characters  and plot. - Photo courtesy of Music Box Films 
Set in 1977 in a provincial town of France, Potiche depicts the story of Suzanne Pujol (Catherine Deneuve) and her rise from potiche to head of an umbrella factory to a feminist politician. Though Suzanne enjoys success, Ozon also details the love triangle between Suzanne, Suzanne’s unfaithful, despotic husband Robert (Fabrice Luchini) and Robert’s vying unionist rival, Babin (Gérard Depardieu).
The film starts with a quasi-showgirl intro that depicts Suzanne running through a park, decked out in fancy exercise clothes and strutting what she’s got, or at least what she thinks she’s got. The opening scene introduces two of the main problems presented in the film: individual identity and the insecurities of aging love.
The themes help Ozon interweave his characters, forming a web of multiple sub-plots and vacillating relationships. Ozon’s characters each struggle with their successful careers and independent identities, creating an ongoing strife between the different sexes and classes portrayed in the film.
Ozon makes excellent use of his talented cast, drawing fine lines between the male and female characters.
Perhaps the most important inter-female relationship in the film is the one between Suzanne and her daughter, Joëlle (Judith Godrèche). Joëlle serves as her mother’s foil during the film’s course, representing liberalism as an independent single mother.
By the end of the film, however, Ozon drastically swaps their roles as Suzanne develops a political career and Joëlle submits to the bonds of marriage and conservatism.
When it comes to the men, Robert serves as Ozon’s most accessible figure of male ridicule and stereotype. Robert is a tyrannical husband, master and father tri-figure who morphs into quite the opposite by the end of the film.
Robert’s role is central to the plot of the film, but Suzanne’s son Laurent (Jérémie Renier) is arguably Ozon’s most shocking vehicle for social and sexual commentary, posing as a potential candidate for incest.
The film presents a questionable relationship between Paul and a “girlfriend.” Ozon reveals throughout the film’s progression that the purported “girlfriend” is most likely male, and possibly one of Suzanne’s bastard sons, raising one of Ozon’s classic yet notorious questions: Is it incest if there is no chance of having a child?

Donald Sterling, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, is arguably one of the worst owners in professional sports.
He has been (and still is) involved in countless discrimination lawsuits. He heckles his own players on the court and refused to pay for one of his longest-tenured assistant coach’s cancer treatments because they “didn’t fall under the healthcare plan” (according to a story in the Journal Times).
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Yet NBA commissioner David Stern continues to support Sterling’s tenure as owner.
That support is not necessarily explicit, but Stern’s refusal to hold Sterling to the same personal conduct policy to which he holds players and coaches indicates clear favoritism toward Sterling and owners generally.
NBA legend Elgin Baylor worked for Sterling as the Clippers’ general manager from 1986 until he was fired in 2008. Soon after, the 11-time all-star filed a wrongful termination suit on the basis that he was fired because of his race and his age.
This case is just one in a long line of civil suits against Sterling.
In 2005, Latino and black tenants in Sterling’s Koreatown apartment complex accused Sterling of trying to drive them out because of their race. Sterling lost the suit. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a similar suit against Sterling because of his refusal to lease apartments to black people in Beverly Hills.
Take these numerous incidents, combine them with the multitude of sexual harassment lawsuits Sterling has had to take on and it’s clear the man is a liability to the NBA’s image.
If any player faced the number of lawsuits and legal issues Sterling has, Stern would have already given him a swift warning and perhaps even a suspension, in keeping with the league’s stringent conduct policy.
Let’s take Stern’s most recent comments about Orlando Magic head coach Stan Van Gundy. Van Gundy’s star player, Dwight Howard, has been fouled a league-high 593 times, but not one has been called a flagrant foul. In his frustration, Howard has been called for 16 technical fouls.
Van Gundy then voiced his disgust and disappointment, claiming Stern doesn’t allow dissenting opinions. Stern responded, saying “we won’t be hearing from [Van Gundy] for the rest of the season.”
Meanwhile, Stern has turned a blind eye to Sterling’s actions.
For Stern, money trumps all misdeeds, and the Clippers play in the second-largest media market in the United States, minimize expenses and maximize profit, meaning Sterling is an ideal owner from Stern’s spreadsheet-based point of view.
Sterling also blames everyone but himself for the on-court failure the Clippers have experienced since he became the owner. His immature antics, such as heckling former Clippers point guard and resident pastry taster Baron Davis in the middle of the game, make that clear.
It is those antics that often keep marquee players from ever signing with the Clippers despite the team’s ability to offer them more money.
Although Sterling is quick to fault everyone else, he has yet to realize that he is the problem.
Stern has coddled him and permitted him to live in a bubble. That bubble allows him to carry on with his misanthropic behavior, destroy the Clippers’ image and make a profit while doing so.
Stern’s silence signifies a level of tacit approval of Sterling’s actions.
While the players are held to a golden standard, Stern and his billionaire owners’ club, led by Sterling, stick together until the end.

This house can learn, too
Service learning is the foundation that the Joint Educational Project House is built on.
To say that extra credit is “handed out” to volunteers would be a severe understatement.
JEP volunteers must earn whatever credit they receive, and the tasks JEP volunteers undertake vary based on which courses they participate through.
JEP staff works closely with USC professors and students to make the JEP program reflect the USC courses.
Whereas oceanography students teach geology concepts in Los Angeles classrooms, sociology students volunteer as mentors in classrooms or battered women’s shelters, applying concepts from their course to their experiences at their site in their weekly essay assignments.
Of course there has to be some instruction on how to teach, but this does not discount the benefits students receive academically.
The underlying idea is that in order to teach something, you must learn it completely.
By teaching college-level concepts in Los Angeles classrooms, our volunteers are consistently reinforcing the material they learn in their USC courses.
JEP is not built to assist desperate students in comprehending the intricacies of Chemistry 105bL, but it does provide a mechanism for more abstract concepts to become grounded in reality.
We hope and expect that our volunteers take away more from our program than the extra credit they receive or the knowledge about teaching. At the end of the semester, JEP asks for feedback on the program.
Most commonly students report that participating in JEP increased their performance in their course throughout the semester outside of the extra credit.
This goes to show that service learning is still alive and strong on USC’s campus.

Students need more alert
On March 4, I was skateboarding from my apartment on 27th Street and Magnolia Avenue to a house near the corner of 29th and Hoover streets where I had left my phone earlier in the day. As I approached 29th on Orchard Avenue, I began to notice a steady stream of people heading in the opposite direction and a general feeling of unease among them. As I turned onto 29th I saw police cars speeding down from both Hoover and Vermont Avenue. More and more people were fleeing from an apartment complex and it wasn’t until I passed the scene on the other side of the street that I saw DPS leaning over a man lying on the sidewalk. 
Of course, this shooting was the incident that has now been widely covered by the Daily Trojan, ATVN, and even the local news. Over the course of the next few hours, however, the university sent no warning, notice or alert to the USC community. I am a senior, and during the last three years I have seen the number of crime report emails wane. They used to come almost weekly, usually describing a robbery or assault “in an effort to better communicate with the campus community about public safety issues.” I was talking just the other week about how I don’t receive these emails anymore. 
Perhaps crime in the area has truly decreased. I do believe that the presence of the yellow-jacketed CSC officers has made the North University Park area safer at night. 
I am skeptical, though, that crime has decreased as much as USC would like us to believe. The lack of notice about crimes like the one that occurred that night is the result of a calculated plan to buck the historically dangerous reputation of the USC area. I believe the attempt to make USC a more attractive place for applicants and to boost our position in national university rankings has been the university’s first priority under President C. L. Max Nikias, even at the expense of student safety.
The USC emergency email and text message system has been utilized over the last few years to alert students of incidents such as suspicious packages (from Leavey Library to as far away as 35th Street and Budlong Avenue), gas leaks and loss of power and internet services at the Health Sciences Campus. The last use of this system was Jan. 14, according to the Trojans Alert website. 
To me, the use of this emergency system in a situation like the shooting should have been obvious. 29th Street is heavily populated by USC students and the shooting occurred at a time of night when many students would be returning home from parties or the 901 Bar and Grill. It is astounding to me that not one notification was sent when several shots were fired in the middle of the street and the assailants were not apprehended. 
If the university or President Nikias has a response to why no such notice was sent, I, and I’m sure many other students and parents, would be interested to hear it.
Although a positive public image is clearly a valuable thing for a top-tier university like ours, protecting this image while endangering the student population is absolutely unacceptable.

Earthquake preparedness is an integral part of Japanese culture. Earthquake procedure pamphlets are a staple at elementary schools. Every year on Sept. 1, the country’s Disaster Prevention Day, many public and private facilities dutifully perform earthquake and fire drills.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Japan also spent hundreds of millions of dollars and more than a decade constructing an earthquake early warning system, which, when a 9.0-magnitude earthquake hit March 11, sent out millions of warning messages via cellphone, email, television networks, radio stations, schools and factories.
Japan is in the midst of dealing with the aftermath of a tragic, domino-like sequence of events — an earthquake followed by a tsunami that damaged a nuclear power plant — that it was, in fact, extremely well prepared for.
The disaster in Japan could have been even worse had the Japanese lacked their well -established system and culture of safety.
As students who live in an area long overdue for a major earthquake, we are in the perfect position — not only as a part of a well-connected campus environment, but also as part of a university with an award-winning emergency response plan.
Moreover, we have a multitude of earthquake preparedness resources.
Clearly, we can further our own culture of safety and preparedness in California.
Steve Goldfarb, fire safety and emergency planning specialist with USC Career and Protective Services, said in an email there is a 99 percent probability of a large (magnitude 6.7 or greater) earthquake occurring in California within the next 20 to 30 years.
Goldfarb argued, therefore, the annual ShakeOut drill demands participation from all students.
Researchers have found that major earthquakes occur, on average, every 88 years in the southern section of the San Andreas Fault, located near the San Bernardino mountains. The last massive earthquake (magnitude 7.9) was in 1857.
USC is well equipped to handle a future earthquake. When an earthquake hits, response begins with the Dept. of Public Safety activating the university’s response and recovery plan, according to Goldfarb. Officers then patrol campus to look for damage or injuries. The Emergency Operations Center, which is in charge of coordinating emergency response and recovery,  handles any problems that might follow.
Similar to Japan’s emergency communication system, but on a much smaller scale, USC uses TrojansAlert, an instant notification system, to send a message to your email or cell phone in the case of an emergency.
“USC has an excellent emergency preparedness program,” Goldfarb wrote. “The more people are made aware of what to do and how to prepare and the more people actually take the time to get themselves prepared, the better off we will be.”
Still, it’s one thing to have an emergency response and recovery system with trained officials in place.
It’s another thing for students and faculty to be aware of proper earthquake procedure — in other words, for the Trojan community to engage in creating a culture of preparedness.
Disaster education is integral to learning how to prepare for the unthinkable.
Students can get educated and stay informed by taking advantage of the multitude of resources on campus, such as an earthquake preparedness workshop taught by Goldfarb scheduled for April 12.
Emergency preparedness is more than the ubiquitous fire phrase, “stop, drop and roll,” many of us probably memorized in elementary school.
“Stop, drop and roll,” isn’t even accurate in the case of an earthquake — it’s actually “Drop, cover and hold on.”
Such details might seem inane, but an ingrained knowledge of preparedness basics coupled with Japan’s earthquake early-warning system saved thousands of lives  March 11.
It’s highly likely an earthquake will hit California in our lifetime. And it will happen sooner rather than later.
Students are the ideal jumping off point for increasing safety awareness and boosting California preparedness culture before that earthquake hits.

Reality TV star and popular figure Kim Kardashian released her dance infused single “Jam (Turn It Up)” on March 2, 2011. Since its debut on Ryan Seacrest’s morning show, on 102.7 KIIS FM, critics and the public alike have given it mixed reviews.
Kardashian has yet to experiment with music as she told Seacrest, “I’ve never sang before, this is definitely something that I don’t do…for me to step out of my comfort zone and do this…is like a really big deal.”
Kardashian put herself in a very vulnerable position in which to be scrutinized and judged by listeners, but found herself reaping the benefits as the infamous blogger, Perez Hilton stated, “Nice going, gurl!!  We are VERY impressed!! We were expecting Heidi Montag music awfulness!”
Many stars have tried and failed to break into the music industry, like Montag of The Hills, simply because of their celebrity status, yet Hilton serves as a testament to the warm reception many have given Kardashian.
Kardashian is donating part of the sale’s proceeds to St. Jude Children’s Hospital, proving that this isn’t just some stunt for fame; she genuinely cares about her charity.
The public has been much more critical. ITunes listeners rated Kardashian with an average of two out of five stars. The general consensus is that she has no talent and only got to her position because of her wealth. Some defended her due to the fact that it will benefit her charity and because it is simply a fun, electric dance number.
Clearly there is a divide amongst listeners, but there is only one way to find out.  Check out this hot (or cold) new commodity and decide for yourself.
“Kardashian is donating part of the sale’s proceeds to St. Jude Children’s Hospital, proving that this isn’t just some stunt for fame; she genuinely cares about her charity.”
I just spit my drink out all over the keyboard due to laughing so hard.

Lionsgate has officially announced that Jennifer Lawrence will be playing the much-coveted role of Katniss Everdeen in the upcoming film adaptation of the popular series, The Hunger Games.  Written by Suzanne Collins, the New York Times bestseller is a science fiction trilogy about a post-apocalyptic world with a little bit of a Twilight-esque twist that has sent thousands of teens and adults into a craze.  Since the release of the last book Mockingjay in 2010, fans have been planning their dream cast for the film adaptation.
Jennifer Lawrence, who has drawn a decent amount of media attention since her Oscar nomination for Winter’s Bone, is  a sure shot for director Gary Ross. But many of the fans are not as impressed for a couple reasons.
First, although this wouldn’t be the first time an older actress is cast for a younger role, Katniss is supposed to be only sixteen while Lawrence is 20 and most likely will be around 24 when the series ends.
Second, Lawrence does not posses the physical attributes of Katniss, having neither the olive skin nor the dark brown hair that mark her as a girl from “the Seam,” a town in the novel. These can both be fixed, though, with the help of a good hair salon and makeup artists.
One thing the fans need not worry about is Lawrence’s dedication to her role and the books. In a statement to fans she said, “I will give everything I have to these movies and to this role to make it worthy of Suzanne Collin’s masterpiece.”
While the game is up for the role of Katniss, actors to play fellow game constant Peeta and her childhood friend Gale are still not confirmed. It’ll be interesting to see if Lawrence has any say in the role of Peeta, as she revealed to Entertainment Weekly in an interview that he is her favorite character, that is besides Katniss of course.  “He’s good and nice in a world that’s harsh and unkind,” she said.
With filming set to begin later this spring, fans won’t have to wait much longer.  Who do you think should play Peeta?

The trailer for Larry Crowne, a film that is written, directed, produced and stars Tom Hanks, has finally arrived.
The romantic comedy pairs Hanks and Julia Roberts, two famous faces who had a significant impact on the genre in the 1990s. The film focuses on Larry Crowne (Hanks), a middle-aged man who decides to enroll in college after being laid off. Roberts stars as a passionless and unenthusiastic professor, who ends up in a mixed romance with her student.
Larry Crowne seems like harmless fun in a genre that has long needed a revival. The question remains whether Hanks can pull off the job, both as the authorial force of the film as well as its star.
The film is the sophomore directorial effort from Hanks, who previously directed That Thing You Do!
Larry Crowne is scheduled for release on July 1, 2011.

During World War II, an estimated 120 Japanese American students attended USC. But in the wake of Pearl Harbor, thousands of Japanese Americans were forcefully relocated to Japanese internment camps across the country.
Recognition · USC Nisei Alumni were honored before a crowd of thousands at the Trojan football game against Arizona in the Coliseum on Oct. 11, 2008. They were awarded “alumni status” at halftime of the game. -   Daily Trojan file photo 
Like all other colleges and universities on the West coast, USC withdrew its Nisei, Japanese American, students from the university and sent them to internment camps, according to From Concentration Camp to Campus: Japanese American Students and World War II by Allan W. Austin, a book written about Japanese students experiences during World War II.
Today, eight USC students have come together in hopes of making up for this injustice.
Starting last year, an entirely student-run coalition was formed to complete the Nisei Diploma Project at USC.
“It is long overdue to give recognition to students affected from Nisei camps,” said Tracy Yen, a sophomore majoring in international relations and one of the project’s organizers.
The project’s goal is to have USC issue honorary degrees to Japanese Americans who were forced to terminate their education at USC and relocate to internment camps.
In 2008, Assemblyman Warren Furutani (D-South Los Angeles County) passed Assembly Bill 37, calling for public institutions to issue degrees to those Japanese American students who were forced to abandon their college education in 1942.
Many University of Californias, California State Universities and community colleges have already issued these honorary diplomas, but USC is yet to do so.
“By issuing these honorary degrees, USC can take the final step in recognizing our fellow Trojans’ education,” said Sally Kikuchi, a first year master student studying public administration and a project organizer.
Yen said she believes this is her opportunity to aid former Trojans.
“These people were college students like us who saw the importance of education,” Yen said. “Taking it from them was wrong and I feel that as a student that can be involved in this, I should help out as much as I can.”
The student group is currently asking members of the USC community to sign a petition stating they “support the initiative to grant honorary degrees to our fellow Trojans.” The petition started in late February and is expected to remain open until midnight Thursday, March 24.
As of March 21, more than 1,136 USC alumni, students, faculty and staff had already signed the petition.
The organization is not searching for a specific number of signatures, but instead hopes to obtain as many signatures as possible, according to Kikuchi.
The petition was established mainly to show that diverse groups within the USC community support the effort proposed by the student group.
“The petition is taking place to show President C. L. Max Nikias and the Board of Trustees that there is a heavy desire to want to recognize students who were unable to receive their education during World War II,” said Kevin Cheung, a senior majoring in business administration, who is in charge of the Nisei Diploma Project. “It shows that as members of the Trojan family we take of each other.”
The student group plans to deliver the petition, a personal letter expressing the importance of providing these diplomas and several letters from on campus organizations supporting the cause, to Nikias’ʼ office Friday.
The project’s organizers have not spoken to President Nikias directly, but Cheung says the group is willing to speak with him on the matter if he allows it.
“There have been previous attempts, but with our current depth of knowledge about the issue, the new bill and a fresh start with newly inaugurated President Nikias, it is the perfect time to start the project,” Cheung said.
If the project is successful, more than 120 Japanese American USC students who were affected will receive their honorary diplomas.
“The success of this project will demonstrate USC’s commitment to validating every student’s education,” Kikuchi said. “It will demonstrate to those outside of USC that our school truly takes the steps to address important issues that have a lasting impact on past, current and future generations.”
It has been nearly 70 years since the Japanese American internment camps, but the projects’ organizers feel the issue is as important now as it was then.
“We can show that even if it takes this long we will do the right thing and support each other,” Cheung said.
So VKC is a hall of shame rather than an “international” building. They were Japanese-AMERICANS and were not treated like Americans. One has to even recall at that time anything west of the Harbor Freeway was off limits to non-white people as far as residing. The country has changed but looks like USC has not. Shame on Sample. Living in San Marino seems the old bugger is probably looking out his windows wondering where all the Chinese people are doing around his ‘hood.
They all deserve an honorary diploma. These are JA’s who were forced to leave school because of Executive Order 9066, even those who were close to graduating from school. There are SO MANY university and high schools giving honorary degrees and USC should follow in their footsteps. It’s something they deserve and we need to stand up!!!!! It’s the RIGHT thing to do…..
Dear DT:
As the former President of the USC Asian Pacific Alumni Association, our Board first raised the issue and brought it to the attention of then-President Steven Sample.
For the record, USC President Rufus Von Kleinsmid and the Board of Trustees refused to release the academic transcripts of the Nisei USC students, who hoped to continue their university studies at schools outside of the West Coast.
For this reason, USC’s punitive actions set it apart from all of the other West Coast universities.  USC remains unapologetic for the academic, professional and emotional damage inflicted upon the students.  The Nisei students who paid the tuition, took the classes,  and sat for examinations discovered that USC erased their academic records based soley upon racial discrimination and wartime hysteria.
Following President Sample’s rejection of issuing honorary degrees, I presented the issue to Assemblymember Warren Furutani, who introduced Assembly Bill 37.
I wrote a personal letter to President Nikias, asking him to reconsider the University’s position.  On March 9, 2011, Provost Elizabeth Garrett responded by stating that, “President Nikias and I agree, therefore, that awarding Honorary Degree Status to our former Japanese-American Nisei students was an appropriate and significant way for USC to acknowledge the injustice they sustained.”
I applaud the students for their efforts in speaking up for their fellow students. “Justice delayed is justice denied.”  It’s time for USC to fully-acknowledge the wrong that was committed and to stop covering-up and denying the past, no matter how much time has elapsed.
Kudos to you. We all need to write letters to President Nikias about this issue. Stand up for what’s right, stand up for justice.

On Friday March 11, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake hit Japan, setting off a tsunami with waves upwards of 12 feet. The epicenter of the earthquake was some 80 miles east of the city of Sendai. By Saturday morning, most northern areas of Japan were scenes of devastation and destruction.

The official death toll in Japan has exceeded 9,000 people, according to the Kyodo news agency, but domestic media has reported that over 20,000 people are dead or missing, according to Reuters. Japanese citizens are facing the loss of their homes and businesses, as well as food shortages, lack of clean water and power outages.
According to USC’s Office of International Services, there are 143 students from Japan enrolled at USC as of Fall 2010.
Ryusuke Kondo, a junior studying psychology is one of these students. Kondo explained he was not initially worried when he heard the news about the earthquake.
“I didn’t think it was such a big problem since we have so very many earthquakes in Japan,” Kondo said. “It wasn’t until I watched the news that I realized the extent of the damage and the seriousness of the situation.”
Another student from Japan, Shih Lee Tsai, first heard about the earthquake when a friend’s mother called from Japan to inform them about the situation. Tsai said it is the resulting blackouts from the failing nuclear reactors that are concerning his family the most.
“I wasn’t able to get through to them until the next day and that was only through Skype,“ Tsai said. “They tell me that the blackouts are very frequent, it’s impossible to do anything.”
Christine Tai, a senior majoring in linguistics and sociology, was able to get in touch with her family immediately after the earthquake hit Friday.
“Tokyo wasn’t hit as hard as the media portrayed it to be. The aftershocks really scare my family and food is scarce,” Tai said. “My mom told me that they’re leaving Japan for a while until things settle down. My grandfather’s going to Shanghai, and my mother to Hong Kong.”
This is Tai’s last semester at USC; she had been looking for employment at home after graduation.
“I’m looking for jobs in Japan right now, but now I’m not sure how that’s going to turn out,” Tai said.
Despite witnessing the terrible effects of the earthquake and tsunami, several students said their families have decided to remain in Japan and attempt to return to a state of normalcy. Sakurako Mori, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said her hometown and house were spared any serious damage.
“A few books fell down, but my house is intact,” Mori said. “But there are several power outages. My mom told me that she has to start cooking dinner earlier, before the power goes out. They’re slightly inconvenienced, but other than that, they’re fine.”
All international students from Japan received an email from OIS the day the earthquake hit, expressing concern about the disaster.
“We are available to talk to Japanese students who may need help with any matter related to this crisis, and there are numerous other campus resources available, including Student Counseling Services, and Student Support and Advocacy,” Tony Tambascia, executive director of the OIS, wrote in an email.

All 17 students who were registered for programs in Japan this spring semester have been contacted by the Office of Overseas Studies in USC’s College Letters, Arts & Sciences following the 9.0 magnitude earthquake that shook the country, triggering a tsunami.
Tony Tambascia, executive director of the Office of International Services, wrote in an email that eight of the students’ programs have been cancelled by their host institution. They are now returning home.
The remaining nine students are on a semester break from their Japanese universities.
Most of the students reported they were traveling outside of Japan at the time of the tsunami, and a few remained in Tokyo.
Their host universities are still considering their immediate plans, but USC has advised its students to withdraw from their local programs and leave Japan as soon as possible.
“USC will assist them in any way possible with issues such as refunds of tuition costs, developing alternate academic plans, and even assistance with making travel arrangements for departing Japan if they have trouble doing so,” Tambascia wrote.
Tambascia encourages any students who are experiencing academic issues to contact their academic advisor or OIS to discuss the situation directly.
OIS has also been in contact with the USC Japanese Student Association and has asked the organization to remind its members about the support services available to students, whether they require help now or in the future.
These services include counseling services from Trojans Care for Trojans, Students Support and Advocacy and the Crisis Response Team.
