President Donald Trump’s public outrage was most recently channelled toward Central America, this time specifically targeting a “migrant caravan” that started in Honduras with the intent of reaching the United States. Currently traveling through the southern states of Mexico, this group of approximately 7,000 people is fleeing the violence and economic instability (to which the U.S. has contributed) that has made many regions uninhabitable. 
Of course, the president and much of his administration have refused to acknowledge the realities that are pushing people to make the incredibly difficult choice to migrate. Instead, Trump took to Twitter to chastise Central American governments, claiming that they were “unable to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S.” As punishment, foreign aid to the countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras will now be “substantially reduced,” and he’s labeling the group of migrants as a threat to national security due to the presence of “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners.”
While Trump’s statements regarding who the caravan consists of are flat out untrue, the more coherent arguments against allowing the caravan’s entry into the U.S. need to take a few key perspectives into consideration. 
First, with regard to the numbers: Putting aside the question of general immigration policy, this specific incidence relates to 7,000 people. While this is undeniably a large group of people, we must contextualize this number with the existing population of the United States. At 325.7 million people strong, an additional 7,000 people would represent a mere 0.002 percent of society. This would equate to seven migrants for every 325,700 Americans. Even on the smaller scale of American border states that the migrants would either pass through or settle in, such as California, Arizona and Texas, the group would make up 0.017 percent, 0.09 percent and 0.025 percent of the populations, respectively. These numbers also assume that all 7,000 people would stay together in one place, which is highly unlikely. 
The fear regarding migrants’ impact on America may therefore be overinflated. The more plausible reality is that this group would be seamlessly absorbed into the workforce and into communities without creating any negative change. 
Of course, there are many arguments being made as to why allowing undocumented entry is unjust, regardless of the proposed lack of societal impact. The morality of allowing people to break the law, from what I’ve observed, is a top concern. To this, I urge that we try our best to understand these migrants’ circumstances, and how they were left with no other option but to attempt to move to the U.S. without papers. 
There are two main elements that have contributed to this lack of choice: the violent environment and unstable economy from which escape is necessary, and the extremely slow process of obtaining legal status in the U.S. by seeking asylum.

In Honduras, for example, 60.9 percent of the population is living in poverty due to high levels of unemployment. To worsen the burden of this economic crisis, widespread gang violence exacerbates instability by means of threats and extortion. For many, the meager income earned is frequently lost to organized crime as a form of “payment” for being left alone. 
However, due to actions taken by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the workings of U.S. case law, U.S. courts rarely recognize gang threats as a viable reason for seeking asylum. As such, winning asylum status is not an easy task; for those who must flee in order to protect their lives, waiting for this process (which does not guarantee the granting of asylum status) is a privilege that they cannot afford. 
Florence Weinberg, an immigration lawyer based in Oaxaca, Mexico, offered me an example of how the U.S. legal system fails to take many migrants’ circumstances into consideration. 
“I represented a young woman from El Salvador who was stalked by a gang leader, and the immigration judge did not believe this was threatening– the man probably just wanted to be her boyfriend, according to him,” Weinberg told me. “This man was, in fact, a murderer with ties to the MS-13. And what proof did she have that this man was a murderer and a gang member? She had her word and the word of those who lived in her town. But this was not enough for the judge, and she was denied asylum.”
Taking this woman’s situation into consideration –– one that parallels thousands of others who are trying to flee –– suggests why migrating the “fair” or “right” way is not an option for many. If it’s probable that you won’t be able to legally prove your experiences in a way that satisfies the judge, is it worth waiting through the process while your life and the lives of your loved ones continue to be threatened? In response to arguments referencing the lack of legality surrounding the entry of the caravan, I therefore ask for the consideration of situations to which our laws have failed to provide justice in the first place. 
Finally, while there are many who deem allowing entry the moral choice for the U.S. to make, they may not see this as a politically viable option. Concern over the message that this action would send to opposing political parties (especially in light of the upcoming midterm elections), coupled with the signal it may send to prospective migrants, may discourage support. A large part of the former is rooted in the hyper-politicization of a humanitarian issue; the caravan is viewed as another pawn with which political parties can seize power. With this in mind, it’s important to be reminded of the humanity of this crisis. These are decisions that impact thousands of vulnerable families, and the ability to see past politicization that we’re being confronted with is essential. 
Speaking to the potential encouragement of more migration, it’s worth noting that Trump’s reduction of foreign aid sent to Central American countries is more likely to increase migration rates than anything else. The further erosion of these countries ability to invest in social services and the reduction of violence will only worsen living conditions, potentially inspiring more movement north. Since the population of undocumented migrants has remained stagnant at 11.3 million for the last years, Trump’s diminishment of foreign aid has a higher likelihood of changing these numbers than anything else. 
As this group of migrants continues to travel toward the U.S. border, we must try our best to stress their humanity, which is often lost in a sea of legality, politics and media coverage. Having just visited the Suchiate River that separates Guatemala from Mexico and seeing the migrant shelters that many will pass through in the sweltering heat, the intensity of their journey has made it clear that the choice to migrate is not one taken lightly. Unimaginable sacrifices have been made in an attempt to reach safety, and we share the responsibility of ensuring their stories are heard.

Coffee has hit its lowest price per pound in years, and the only direction for prices to go is up. Coffee prices are increasing — to this statement, Ray-Ban- sporting, salted-caramel-latte-sipping Angelenos and Central American coffee farmers both vigorously nod in agreement. 
We pay more per cup, and more per pound — though the former is due to inflation and the upsurge in charging for aesthetic, and the latter is due to a resurgence of a debilitating disease that affects worldwide coffee production of which that most coffee drinkers are ignorant.
The largest stunt in the growth of the coffee industry and cause of failure for many farms is coffee rust. This disease is caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix, a species found almost anywhere coffee is grown. Another form of coffee rust, Hemileia coffeicola, is confined to central and western Africa, but can be just as damaging as its more widespread cousin. 
Coffee rust is easily identifiable by the large yellow lesions it causes on coffee leaves; it spreads throughout infected plants and to new ones, causing plants to die prematurely. 
The next generation of coffee plants grow from the fallen fruit, but rust prevents the plants from reaching their fruit-bearing stages. Its origins are uncertain, but this fungus had not appeared in Central America or Southeast Asia — both major suppliers for the planet’s coffee production — before the late 1800s.
Coffee dates back well before the 1500s, and it is said to have first been discovered in Arabia and Ethiopia. When the Dutch realized the industry’s potential, they began setting up farms in their colonies, including Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka). Sri Lanka became one of the largest coffee producers, exporting over 100 million pounds per year by the 1870s. 
But in that same time period, farmers began noticing yellow splotches on their plants — coffee rust had arrived from overseas, and from there it continued to spread.
The fungus slowly wiped out farms and plants — the major exporters of coffee at the time were soon unable to continue growing the plant at the same volume. Today Sri Lanka is known for its tea, as the region turned to another commodified beverage. The country’s coffee industry never returned to the size of its former glory. 
The fungus hit Brazil, now the largest exporter of coffee, in the late 1900s. 2013 saw another breakout of coffee rust in Colombia and Central America, and the U.S. Agency for International Development reported that nearly half a million people from the affected areas who relied on the crop to survive lost their food security and means of living.
In 2014, under the Obama administration, the U.S. Agency for International Development and Texas A&M University’s World Coffee Research partnered to study coffee rust and eliminate it. Researchers are still uncertain about how to eliminate rust completely, but we do know of some relation between the ways coffee is grown and its susceptibility to rust. 
The World Coffee Research reports a correlation between shade and rust — coffee that is grown in full sunlight has less rust, but is stressed under sun exposure and less able to fight the fungus. But in creating open fields with maximum sun exposure, deforestation is inevitable, and thus continues the clearing of rainforests and the decimation of hundreds of species (not to mention our protective ozone layer and fresh air, for that matter).
Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora are two major species of coffee. The former is responsible for most third wave brews — it is more valuable because of its better flavor. The latter, however, is cheaper to grow and has more resistant leaves. 
Colombia’s National Federation of Coffee Growers set up a laboratory called Cenicafe to conduct research on growing species of coffee that are rust resistant without sacrificing flavor. One of the researchers’ main targets is to increase the genetic diversity among beans for increased resistance to illness, climate change, insects and other harmful effects. 
Growing coffee is a struggle on countless fronts — environmental protection, farmer protection, even biological preservation of species and the creation of hybrid ones — these are all issues that the coffee industry contributes to. 
Coffee keeps you awake, and at the very least, you ought to stay woke — supporting research and spreading awareness are the simplest things we can do to protect farmers, the environment and everyone’s beloved crop.

In “Weed the People,” director Abby Epstein makes a case for increased research on medical marijuana by observing several families that resort to it for their children’s treatment. (Photo from IMDb)
Documentaries have a two-fold function — to provide information and to keep their audiences engaged. Abby Epstein’s “Weed the People” fulfills both of these requirements. 
The documentary follows the lives of several families resorting to the use of medical marijuana for treatment as they desperately attempt to save their children’s lives. In relaying its core message, that marijuana use can alleviate the pain of life-threatening diseases, “Weed the People” is masterful. 
Epstein uses the lives of several children, ranging from infants to high school seniors, to vilify the federal government and pharmaceutical corporations for hindering the progress made with cancer treatment. 
At one point, the documentary appeared trite, comparable to YouTube conspiracy binge content, as a cast of accredited doctors and concerned parents question the disappearance of educational cannabis articles from government websites. The scene follows the same people raising suspicion over the United States’ hypocrisy of holding a patent over marijuana’s medical value. 
One of the documentary’s main subjects is an infant named Sophie, whose parents chose cannabis-related treatments over traditional chemotherapy. Each of her health updates serves as dramatic high points that can either validate or invalidate the drug’s medical efficacy. As in real life, the children’s health updates generate the warmest of smiles and teariest of eyes, as modern medicine paired with the unknown power of cannabis both helps and fails some of the film’s young subjects. 
The most thought-provoking moment in the documentary comes when a patient’s mother points out how “billions of dollars go into cancer research and here we are relying on medicine made in somebody’s kitchen.” Her statement forces viewers to consider why people are still questioning the medical efficacy of cannabis, while also introducing a major problem with the drug — its lack of regulation. Epstein stresses this problem by including a revealing scene that shows a young boy who has been consuming mostly isopropyl alcohol diluted with a fraction of the $3,000 medicinal cannabis his mother paid for.
There were some scenes, however, that seemed extraneous and forced. For instance, a fight between a “home pharmacist” and “momcologist” adds no value to the conversation surrounding cannabis use by cancer patients.
From a family traveling over 2,000 miles to medicate their child to a teen miraculously losing 20 tumors, “Weed the People” is filled with elements that, although click-baity, measured to keep the audience engaged. When a storyline of a mother choosing to form her own competing medical marijuana business against the people that helped save her daughter’s life arises an hour into the documentary, it seems as if Epstein forgot the film’s purpose and instead opted for theatrics. Much like the rubbing alcohol and the $3,000 cannabis, the incident dilutes the documentary’s main message.
The documentary is ultimately a 97-minute ad campaign for the government to declassify marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug. 
Despite a late storyline’s attempt to sabotage a well-rounded documentary, Epstein accomplishes her main goal of forcing viewers to wonder: “Why isn’t medical marijuana helping to save lives yet?”

After Tuesday’s screening, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi (second from left), Jimmy Chin (third from left) and Alex Honnold (far right) spoke with students about the making of “Free Solo.” (Keala Rusher | Daily Trojan)
On Tuesday night, the School of Cinematic Arts hosted thrillseekers at a screening of “Free Solo,” a documentary following professional rock climber Alex Honnold as he became the first person to free solo El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. Originally, the post-screening Q&A only included directors Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin but, in a surprise to the audience, Honnold also attended.
Free soloing is rock climbing without ropes or any device to catch a falling climber, meaning the stakes for each move are incredibly high. The film attempts to capture the risk analysis and training involved in Honnold’s record-breaking journey, a process involving months of preparation and training. 
The film opens with an aerial shot of gray granite, then shifts to reveal Honnold in a bright red shirt standing on the edge of an enormous cliff overlooking a dense forest. 
Beyond its compelling narrative, the film highlights many breathtaking views of the crew’s rock climbing expeditions, including Yosemite and Zion national parks, as well as Todra Gorge in Morocco. 
The audience develops an intimate understanding of Honnold, and soon learns that he has a unique outlook on the work he does. 
“Anyone could die on any given day, soloing just makes it feel more immediate,” Honnold said in the film. 
Honnold makes it clear that he does not fear death so much as he fears not living up to his own expectations. Honnold’s friend and fellow professional climber Tommy Caldwell helped him prepare for the climb, and delivers an honest, if morbid, take on the sport in the film.
“Imagine any gold medal sport but if you don’t get the gold, you die,” Caldwell said in the film. “That’s free soloing.”
Honnold attributes his practical and sometimes detached demeanor as what makes him so successful at climbing, especially soloing — it’s his unique ability to separate each movement from its potentially dire consequence. During the Q&A, Vasarhelyi commented on Honnold’s first attempt to free solo El Capitan, where he ascended to 500 feet before deciding to turn around. Honnold then trained for six more months before successfully completing the climb. 
“The turnaround in the fall actually gave us a lot of confidence; it was very clear that we made the right decision in trusting Alex’s judgment,” Vasarhelyi said. “It gave us a very special dress rehearsal where we understood [how to] manage emotions.” 
By the day of the climb, the crew and Honnold had made considerable adjustments from the initial attempt. Everyone felt more fit and well prepared, and the whole team compromised to ensure Hannold was comfortable and alleviated the pressures of climbing on camera while still capturing the necessary shots to make the film one of the most critically acclaimed films to date. 
“Free Solo” was released on Sept. 28 and is playing in most major theaters in the U.S.

Dariel Filomeno | Daily Trojan
Whether they are an ideological minority in their state or they feel insignificant in a country of millions, many students believe their votes are close to worthless in a time when voting is more valuable than ever. 
Allegations of voter suppression in the states of Georgia and North Dakota amid the 2018 midterm election season prove that the right to vote is, unfortunately, a privilege that some are granted and others are barred from. Those who have access to this privilege must take advantage of it for their own sakes and also on behalf of disenfranchised citizens. 
A 2017 Georgia state law allowed Gov. Brian Kemp to invoke the exact match law while running for re-election against Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams — who would be the first black female governor ever elected in U.S. history. The law requires a voter registration application to be left pending, or even suspended, if information on the form does not exactly match records kept by Georgia’s Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration. 
While the piece of legislation may seem fair to those who suspect voter fraud in the country, its’ fine print points to some inaccuracies — and suspicions of targeting minorities. The law led to 53,000 suspended voter registration applications, some even rejected for minor infractions such as a missing hyphen from a surname. And while African Americans comprise 32 percent of Georgia’s population, they represent about 70 percent of suspended applications, according to The New Yorker.
Georgia is not the only state with suspicious activity occurring during midterm elections. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to overturn a voter ID law in North Dakota requiring residents to show identification with a current street address. Some accuse the law of targeting Native Americans, who do not have physical addresses on reservations and are overrepresented in the homeless population, according to the Urban Institute. Polling stations accepted Native American IDs for the primary, but are now declaring their identification invalid less than a month before Election Day.
These laws may seem innocent on the surface, but they are slippery slopes, with flaws hidden in the blind spot of every turn. Verification services can be vulnerable to biases, or potentially reject applications for minute errors. 
These services unfairly disenfranchise historically marginalized populations, and perpetuate the systemic oppression which has and continues to silence those not granted the privilege to use their political voice. Essentially, the laws intended to exclude those deemed undeserving of a voice in our political system may actually be turning against us by disenfranchising those who eligible to participate in our democracy. 
Thirteen states continue this trend of disenfranchisement by either considering a felon’s potential right to vote in relation to their convicted crime, or by requiring a governor pardon to restore voting rights. These laws unfairly target marginalized populations, who are convicted of crimes at disproportionate rates compared to their privileged counterparts.  
Florida, a state with particularly tough criminal laws, only allows those convicted with felonies to receive restored voting rights by a governor pardon. In five years, Florida Gov. Rick Scott restored voting rights to less than 2,000 Floridians statewide — and 20,000 applications remain pending. The disenfranchised population in Florida has grown from 150,000 to about 1,686,000 in a matter of just six years.
This legislation, which can easily be argued as targeting marginalized demographics in our country, is emblematic of the fact that a simple check in a box is unfortunately and unfairly exacted as a privilege. It is a privilege to have a voice in a system that can either allow further oppression to continue or end it through a change of leadership. 
As instances of injustice pop up in headlines daily, there is yet another reason to proclaim that, yes, all votes matter. They matter because, in a chorus of assent and dissent, each voice is necessary to the melody of democracy. They matter because each vote counts for the individual and countless others. They matter because a vote is only worthless when thrown away. 
If USC students are among the privileged who are not targeted by voter suppression laws, then they must see their vote as an opportunity to advocate for the disenfranchised, and show up to vote — if not for themselves, then for the thousands who cannot.

Political parties often utilize social movements and the interest groups behind them to their advantage: A concrete movement entails a concrete audience, which parties can rely on to be included in their voter base. For example, the Republican Party has supported the National Rifle Association through policies and platform points, creating an inclination for NRA members to vote red. 
It’s a no-brainer: 77 percent of NRA members are registered Republicans because the party often acts in the group’s best interests. And as long as GOP politicians continue to support legislation in favor of the NRA’s objective, this symbiotic relationship will persist. 
This relationship between social movements and political parties is an ingrained component of the American political system. But it crosses the line when it involves the issue of sexual assault — an issue that should not be used as a political bargaining chip. Bargaining has occurred on both sides of the aisle, at the expense of sexual assault survivors. 
Democrats employed this technique to halt the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court by harnessing supporters of the #MeToo movement to discredit Kavanaugh. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein kept Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s story private for three months. Ford’s information about Kavanaugh became public knowledge six days into his confirmation process. This late revelation shows how Feinstein, along with other members of the Democratic Party, used the subject of sexual assault as a political strategy. It seemed they hoped to pressure senators to vote against Kavanaugh and demobilize Republicans until after the midterm elections.
Republicans lashed back against Democrats’ efforts, entirely ignoring the issue of Ford’s sexual assault. By racing to swear Kavanaugh in, the GOP blatantly ignored Ford’s testimony and the moral ineptitude that Kavanaugh could potentially represent as a Supreme Court justice. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham heard Ford’s heart-wrenching testimony and, hours later, proceeded to viciously attack her. 
The diabolical fight between these politicians completely threw a wrench in the political process, preventing a timely, bipartisan hearing and vote from happening properly. The Kavanaugh hearings showed the dark effects of political polarization and completely demeaned the #MeToo movement. 
The Democratic Party has also politicized the Black Lives Matter movement. The topic of police misconduct was raised nationally by Black Lives Matter leaders and activists, but has been adopted as part of the Democratic agenda. It’s positive that sexual assault and misconduct is receiving attention from the Democratic Party, but during such a time of political polarization, this could potentially hinder social change. 
Though the Black Lives Matter movement received commendable national attention, it’s crucial to note that pressure from political polarizations distracted politicians from the movement’s cause. Almost immediately after the Democrats began discussing it in the 2016 primary debates and featured the mothers of police brutality victims in their national convention, Republicans quickly aligned themselves with the (falsely equivalent) Blue Lives Matter movement. Despite the awareness the Democrats helped these activists gain, the party was hindered from fully supporting the movement because it was derailed by political adversity. Now, police officers are still acting out of aggression and both reformative efforts face serious hostility and opposition — despite sharing the common goal of achieving improved relationships between citizens and police. 
While the #MeToo movement is publicly associated with liberal values, but sexual assault must remain a bipartisan issue. Sexual assault cannot become partisan; it is an issue that affects everyone, regardless of age and gender. As a nation, we must unite and confront sexual violence, and not repeat the mistakes that political parties have made by aligning themselves with social movements.

Freshman setter Raquel Lázaro tallied just four digs against Stanford, at the end of September, compared to her average 10.3 per match. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Coming off a loss last weekend, the women’s volleyball team is looking to get back on track and finish with two strong victories this weekend. With their 7-1 home record, the No. 15 Trojans will face No. 2 Stanford on Friday and Cal on Sunday. 
Entering the second half of conference play, USC will be facing both opponents for the second time, but going in with a plan on how it can improve. 
“We’ve played everybody, so we can do some stat work and see where we stack up against everybody else,” head coach Brent Crouch said. “We did all of that homework and the two areas we need to get better in are serve receive and … killing balls off the serve receive.”
While the Trojans know what they need to improve, individual players like freshman setter Raquel Lázaro has her own goals for this weekend. After playing Stanford once before this season, Lázaro knows how she can help the team come away with a victory.
“Stanford is a very good team and they are very tall, so hitting hard and putting the sets high enough so the swingers can hit the ball hard and high [will be key],” Lázaro said. “For me, it’s finishing high on my pass. I know this. Then, if my hitters are low, they are not going to be able to do anything against the block because the [blockers’ hands] are very high.”
 At practice this week, the team has focused on its game plan for Stanford. The players know the Cardinal are tall, with nine players over six feet, the tallest being 6-foot-6. USC’s hitters have to figure out ways to hit around the block and get their opponent out of system. 
One of the biggest concerns is Stanford’s size, especially junior outside hitter Kathryn Plummer. Plummer is touted as one of the best outside hitters in the country with the seventh-most points per set in the NCAA . 
“They are huge everywhere,” Crouch said. “If you can shut down left sides you’re going to win most of the time. We didn’t have an answer for her last time. If we can at least knock one of [Stanford’s top players] down that will help a ton.”
The Trojans are also looking for the crowd to keep up the same energy it has had all season, especially against Stanford.
“It will be great to have the energy of the crowd carry us a little bit,” Crouch said. “It’s hard enough to play a really good team and then to have a bunch of people rooting for you to lose doesn’t help … Stanford will have to deal with our fans.”
Crouch noted the benefit of having already played the Cardinal earlier this season.
“We’ve got a really clear idea about what they want do against us, so we can gameplan a little bit more,” Crouch said. “But all these games are, for the most part, serve, pass and who can win that battle. They won last time.”
First serve against Stanford Friday will be at 7 p.m. and Cal Sunday at 1 p.m. Both games will be played at Galen Center.

Los Angeles has too many sports teams. 
It’s probably the only city to offer two options for every sport — Rams or Chargers, Lakers or Clippers, Dodgers or Angels. In a city this stuffed with superstars and national championship bids, it’s nearly impossible to carve out the space for a new team.
This couldn’t be more true when it comes to soccer, the fourth-tier sport city’s (or perhaps even fifth or sixth, behind college football and basketball). Los Angeles has seen its fair share of failed soccer ventures — read up on Chivas USA if you need proof of this — and until this year, the hold of the Galaxy and its legion of edge-of-retirement headliners seemed too strong to break.
But this season, all of that was proven wrong with the introduction of LAFC. The fledgling club was forced to take on a behemoth of the MLS in rooting itself into the Los Angeles sports culture. It was a David and Goliath story, one that the new team never won on the pitch when the two crosstown rivals met three times throughout the season.
And yet, at the end of this season — as LAFC sits in second in the Western Conference, 9 points ahead of a Galaxy team that won’t make the playoffs — it feels as if the new kids won this round. It might be a little early to say this, but I’m going to go ahead and do it. LAFC is soccer in Los Angeles.
It’s hard to pinpoint exactly what LAFC did right, but one scene from every home game stands out to me for some reason. In the moments leading up to kickoff, the team flaunts its mascot, Olly, a Red Naped Shaheen that zips around the stadium at 210 miles per hour. 
Each game, a different celebrity or member of the community holds Olly to begin this ceremony. Last week, it was Meghan Trainor. In weeks past, it was Sophia Bush, Ty Burrell. On the home opener, co-owner Will Ferrell emerged with the bird held high on his fist, screwing up his face in his notorious stank face while lifting his arm in a triumphant stance. And then, while Olly swoops along the stands, the Jumbotron features one of those video of the team, complete with aggressively epic music, to set the rhythm for the bird’s dips and drops.
It’s stupid. I don’t mean to sound judgmental, but this ritual is stupid, and it’s exactly the reason that LAFC works so well. A lot of what makes sports great is also what makes it dumb — body paint, cheeseheads, ass slapping, turnover chains — you name it. Sports are silly and dumb and fun, and that’s the point. 
LAFC captured this spirit of fun, with all its silly excitement and boisterous chants. Perhaps it was best equipped to do so with Ferrell at the helm, attending games and offering support in his unique, witty way. 
The team leans firmly into the fun of the sport. It invites celebrity guests left and right, hosts fan events on a weekly basis to spur community interaction between players and fans. This team is tangible, accessible. 
If you wanted to this season, you could meet one of the the team’s leading goal-scorers, Adama Diomande, at an event at a dollar store. Walker Zimmerman, the heart of the team’s defense, regularly daylights as a cook at Pink’s Hot Dogs and Randy’s Donuts. LAFC might be made up of a deep roster of soon-to-be stars, but its emphasis on community involvement has allowed that stardom to feel human. 
In the end, it’s hard to break down every single thing that LAFC did right. On the field, it assembled a deep team led by two stars — Carlos Vela, a Mexican international player who drew wide support from the majority Latino population of downtown Los Angeles, and Diego Rossi, a 20-year-old who has already become the face of the club’s future.
Off the field, the club invested in its people. This simple concept of approaching the community — “street by street, block by block” as one of the team’s slogans reads — shouldn’t feel groundbreaking, yet it was both refreshing and effective.
After one last road game against Sporting KC on Sunday, LAFC will head into its first-.ever MLS playoffs. It will bring a fearsome attack, bolstered by Rossi, Vela and Diomande. But more importantly, the team will bring a fierce fanbase, one that will prepare for victory and remain loyal through defeat.
No matter the outcome of the postseason, LAFC has won something greater than a championship in its inaugural season. The team has won over Los Angeles.

Freshman quarterback JT Daniels may not start for the Trojans this Saturday due to a concussion. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
On the Wednesday after another road loss for the Trojans, third-string quarterback redshirt freshman Jack Sears took all of the starting snaps at quarterback.
Freshman quarterback JT Daniels had failed his concussion test, again. Wednesday marked his third day sitting out, and his third-to-last opportunity to pass protocol and in order to be cleared for Saturday’s home game against ASU. 
With backup redshirt sophomore Matt Fink still sidelined with broken ribs, the sprawling list of injuries has left Sears playing catch up all week. Unless Daniel’s situation improves quickly, Sears will also take his first starting snaps at the Coliseum on Saturday.
“We’re keeping with what we know,” head coach Clay Helton said. “We’re not reinventing the wheel.”
Up until this week, Sears took maybe 10 to 15 percent of snaps in practice, ceding most of his time to Fink and Daniels. He made up for that lack of repetition by studying the playbook, attempting to ready himself in case he was called in for an emergency. It was hard to imagine a situation where the third-string could be called up; but this season, it appears, the impossible happens on a regular basis.
If Daniels does not clear protocol, Sears’ debut will be in a home game against Arizona State that is high-pressure due to circumstance, not necessarily competition. With losses to Stanford and Utah, the Trojans must win out the season of Pac-12 play in order to still vie for a spot in the conference championship in December.
“This is an ultra-important game for our season,” Helton said. 
Preparing for the game has been a week-long process of finding the team’s balance. On the opposite side of the ball, the team has been equally rocked by the loss of linebacker and captain Cam Smith, who Helton confirmed will not play against Arizona State on Saturday. 
On Tuesday, Smith had his knee drained, and he received a pair of injections to help his recovery process. However, when asked about his return, Helton said that it “does not look favorable.”
Smith’s injury was added to a laundry list of injuries weakening the team on both sides of the ball. Senior tight end Tyler Petite spent most of practice holding a pack of ice against his shoulder. Senior offensive tackle Chuma Edoga saw some action, but took off several periods of practice with soreness in his knee and sat out the end of the day. Senior safety Marvel Tell remained limited. Freshman cornerback Olaijah Griffin took the day off because of a shoulder injury.
With the team limited, Helton is turning to his reserves for new firepower. Wednesday’s practice saw the group beginning to grow more comfortable as it adjusted to the loss of key players. With Tell out, senior cornerback Iman Marshall stepped up on Wednesday, snagging a pair of interceptions in scrimmage and excelling in one-on-one situations.
Still, Helton emphasized that the defense has a long way to go in correcting for one-on-one reads and coverage, especially against the run game. After spending more time in the film room — and less on the practice field — on Monday, the team is looking to adjust for an Arizona State team that has only won a single conference game this season.

On Tuesday, the Undergraduate Student Government shared a document of their 2018 Elections Code on their website, allowing students to edit and make comments. 
The USG Elections Code, which was shared via Google Docs, is an extensive set of guidelines. The 15 articles inform the entire student body of aspects surrounding the election process, including campaign periods, conflicts of interest and candidate eligibility.
“It works as an outline for candidates to know what is going on, but also for the general student body to know what to expect,” said Nillani Anandakugan, USG’s co-director of elections and recruitment. “It goes further into detail about what a fair election looks like.” 
The edit access allows students to comment on inconsistencies or unclear language present in the guidelines without permanently changing the document, according to Anandakugan. 
“We realized that there was a lot of stuff that we overlooked,” Anandakugan said. “There were inconsistencies within the old code. In order to cover all of our bases, we wanted to make sure that everyone who is affected by the code has access to it and can give suggestions.” 
Anandakugan said sharing the document is also a way to pursue transparency between USG and the student body.
“Because USG is an organization that serves the student body, the only way to truly serve [them] is to make sure that there is that type of access to electing the individuals who will affect students overall,” Anandakugan said. “We have to be open in all parts of this organization.” 
The document will be available to edit until Nov. 6, the day in which the day the code will be brought in front of the USG Senate to be ratified. After the deadline, the only changes that can be made to the code will be decided by the Senate. 
“We will take all of [the edits] into consideration and present them accordingly,” Anandakugan said.

Los Angeles County Public Health, USC Student Health and Undergraduate Student Government sponsored the annual free flu shot clinic in Hahn Plaza on Wednesday.
Students were invited to line up in front of Tommy Trojan, complete paperwork and receive a free vaccination with no appointment. 
The annual clinic is in its 12th year at USC, and L.A. County Public Health staff estimates that it vaccinated over 400 students this year. 
“College students are very communicable,” said Sharon Sylvers-Sydney, a public health nurse who led the flu clinic. “So that you don’t have an epidemic on campus, it’s good to become vaccinated.”
Sylvers-Sydney said that it is important that students get their flu shots to prevent more serious conditions such as pneumonia and death. She also believes that the free service drew many students to get vaccinated.
“I think it is very important that [the vaccinations] are free,” Sylvers-Sydney said. “I feel that the school should offer them for free. They’re getting the vaccine for free, so they’re  charging to administer it, Which is ridiculous.”
The New York Times reported in January that the flu is “moderately severe” this year and the vaccine appears to be especially ineffective. 
Despite reports, Sylvers-Sydney said she is certain of the importance of L.A. County Public Health initiative. 
“If we vaccinate 500 students here, then that’s 500 less students who are getting the flu, hopefully,” Sylvers-Sydney said. 
The clinic had to close early due to a limited supply of vaccinations, but Sylvers-Sydney said she and the rest of the staff were pleased with the student turnout. 
Nathan Sweeney, a freshman majoring in international relations global business, said that the central location of the clinic made it easily accessible and reminded him to get vaccinated. 
“It’s important to get the flu shot every year, because the flu is not something that you want to catch,” Sweeney said. “I had forgotten about [the clinic], but I was just walking down here and saw that it was going on, so I decided to stop by.”
Lance Good, a senior majoring in communication, said that although she is skeptical as to whether or not vaccinations actually prevents the flu, she does not want to risk getting sick. 
“For my insurance [plan], I have to go to  my doctor to get my shot because I tried to go to CVS but there’s a $40 copay,” Good said. “I probably would not have gotten it if it wasn’t for [the clinic].”

For twin sisters Carmen and Lucero Noyola, there is no denying the importance of education in their lives. Juggling packed schedules as single moms, workers and USC students, the pair is on a mission to make higher education more accessible to foster youth like themselves. 
Working with Jesse Aguiar, the director of the Beyond Foster Care program of Journey House, Carmen and Lucero have passed two bills to assist foster youth throughout the college process.
In Fall 2016, Lucero and Aguiar were on the forefront of advocating for their first California bill, the Higher Education Outreach and Assistance Act for Foster Youth. This bill called for California state universities and community colleges to provide a box that applicants can check to self-identify as foster youth on applications, which then would automatically notify them of available on-campus resources, including scholarships and grants. 
“I had my daughter and then I decided I needed to do something, and education is the path I took,” Lucero said. “Things get in the way of work and education … real-need struggles are definitely barriers that foster youth face once they’re no longer a part of the child welfare system, and education is usually not the priority.”
The following year, Aguilar and the Noyola twins passed a second bill, the Chafee Educational Training Voucher. Aguiar said this bill was significantly more ambitious than the first; it requested the extension of the eligible age limit from 22 to 26 years old and added an additional $4 million to its annual budget. The grant will provide $5,000 to former foster youth each year. 
Aguiar said the grant was unique because it goes directly to the student rather than through the student’s school. This process allows money to go toward other needs of former foster youth. 
“We really just had in mind telling and elevating the stories of the older foster youth population and really trying to raise awareness around what happens when you’re a former foster youth and you age out of the foster care system,” Aguiar said. “We wanted to advocate for more resources for the older foster youth and this really accomplishes that mission.”
Carmen said the successful passing of this bill has opened doors for former foster youth to pursue opportunities that were previously unavailable.
“It doesn’t specifically or deliberately help students get into universities like USC,” she said. “But it gives them that option when they’re able to see, ‘I’m going to apply to USC,’ and they get all these acceptance letters, and they start looking at their financial aid, USC looks horrifying. We can all attest to that, but then when they start counting all their scholarships and the Chafee, they see it more feasible so it makes them take a second look at privates and universities in general like USC.” 
To also help those on campus, Lucero connected Aguiar’s work at the Journey House to USC, through the Trojan Guardian Scholars program, a program, which provides services for former foster, homeless and at-risk students. 
“We’re not used to seeing people … that come from our backgrounds,” said Christina Maricic, a member of TGS. “For me, it was the first time ever seeing somebody, and it still shakes me and I still cry about it because when I first met them, I was in tears and I couldn’t stop crying, and I didn’t want to let them go because it was my first time seeing people doing what I wanted to do.” 
Maricic is now Chafee eligible with the age extension and has switched her major from psychology and sociology to public policy because she was inspired by the Noyola sisters. Maricic said she wants to give back to her community in a similar way. 
“I think that’s the biggest thing, now knowing that,” Maricic said. “That space is no longer limited to me. It’s my biggest thing, as a USC student, it’s crazy to think how that cycle happened here on campus. They created an impact, and it impacted another USC student and a whole bunch of USC students, actually.”

USC’s Young Americans for Freedom chapter set up a table on Trousdale Parkway Wednesday. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The USC chapter of Young Americans for Freedom set up a table on Trousdale Parkway Wednesday, displaying a poster that read, “It’s a Dangerous Time for Men — Change My Mind.” 
The poster spurred a discussion regarding survivors and those accused of sexual assault. 
“We’re not denying that it’s not a dangerous time for women either,” YAF chairman Maxwell Brandon said. “If I had a sign up that said ‘It’s a dangerous time for women,’ no one would come argue with me, but if we put a sign up that says ‘It’s a dangerous time for men,’ it’s all of a sudden a very heated political conversation.”
Throughout the day, various students approached the table and attempted to explain why the poster was problematic, saying that women face greater dangers. Over 90 percent of victims of sexual assault are women and only between 2 and 10 percent of sexual assault reports are deemed false, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.
Brandon, however, said the purpose of the poster was to bring attention to not only how treating the accused as guilty is unreasonable, but also how women must speak out when sexual assaults take place. 
“It’s really difficult to come forward and I understand that,” Brandon said. “But if you really want to change, men not only need to man up and start acting like men … Women need to step forward when it happens too.” 
One USC student, who wished to remain anonymous due to concerns for her safety, approached the table and explained her own experience with sexual assault and why she didn’t initially report it.
“I didn’t report to the police because I was afraid, mostly because I was afraid of the [perpetrator’s] reputation, because I know he has lots of friends and he has a lot of people that could back him up,” she said. “I did not want to go into a trial in something that I felt I could personally get over myself.”
During the disagreement, the student said that YAF Treasurer Tyler Tornetta was repeatedly interrupting her and yelling at her rather than engaging in a debate.
“I just felt really disrespected. I did go over with a hot head and I could’ve probably approached the situation in a calmer manner, but I was trying to at least explain my story … and he just cut me off immediately,” she said. “[I] just felt like my story didn’t mean anything.”
Tornetta said that along with creating dialogue, the organization wants to elevate conservative voices, especially on a campus that he deems predominantly liberal.
“Whether it’s inviting a speaker here, setting up a table such as this where we’re asking people to come actually talk to us and help to try to at least change our minds or setting up a table just to discuss our club,” Tornetta said. “It’s all for the same purpose, which is to introduce the students of USC to our conservative values and to start a conversation.” 
 Jason Williams, a second-year doctoral student in physics, criticized YAF and the poster, stating that it was meant to intimidate students.   
“I just think it is bullshit, honestly,” Williams said. “I don’t think they are actually here to listen. I think they are just here to intimidate.” 
This tabling followed campus controversy regarding sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh and a student-led petition against professor James Moore, who sent a controversial email response about sexual assault accusers to the Price School of Public Policy.
Brandon said YAF wanted to discuss current issues that people were passionate about and that he believed it was important to bring up men’s rights in sexual assault conversations. 
The Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment declined to comment.

Aria Cataño | Daily Trojan
The fence stretches as far as the eye can see. It twists along the edges of the desert rocks, unnaturally clinging to the mountains that rise in the horizon like a bristling spine.
These are the dusty, southern border deserts that I’ll be studying for the next months as I move through Mexico to research migration. And while I never doubted the harshness of these borders, there was something more sinister about the physical presence of the iron bars that loomed over me. Already, I’d encountered what the media could never sufficiently communicate: how intensely America asserts its dominance and recklessly divides the haves and have-nots.
It’s this divide that has shaped the deserts of which four presidential administrations have vehemently warned for decades. The deserts that Bill Clinton “secured” by means of Operation Gatekeeper in 1994, that George W. Bush fortified with the Secure Fence Act in 2006 to “protect the American people” and that Barack Obama bolstered with nearly $20 billion worth of immigration enforcement spending in 2016. With years of tightening immigration policies that have been justified by the need to keep American citizens safe, an implicit message has been sent to the public: The United States-Mexico border is becoming increasingly dangerous. 
It’s easy to be swept up in this narrative of peril. One simply has to look at the media’s presentation of statistics regarding assault and crime along the border in order to conjure up images of the cartels and gangs that President Donald Trump so fervently tweets about. Similarly, government organizations that we’ve been taught to trust warn against unimaginable crimes that seem to be bleeding across territorial lines into the United States. A recent video disseminated by the FBI called “Crime on the Southwest Border” opens with the following claim: 
“The U.S. border with Mexico extends nearly 2,000 miles. And it’s along this expansive stretch of territory that drug cartels and their street gang enforcers play a dangerous and costly trade.
Drug trafficking. Human smuggling. Extortion. Murder. Corrupt public officials. All these crimes represent a multi-billion dollar industry and they pose a threat not only to communities on both sides of the border, but to our national security as well.”
Aria Cataño | Daily Trojan
Fear and trepidation about the border, based on government-issued messages like these, would therefore be justified. And if one looks to assault rates presented by the Department of Homeland Security, the national narrative is upheld: After hitting a low in fiscal year 2013 at 373 assaults, the number has steadily climbed to a high of 847 assaults in fiscal year 2017. If not a direct consequence of the purported violence on the border, what else could explain this increase? 
And yet, the reality behind these growing numbers is rather anticlimactic in comparison to what the media and federal agencies would lead the public to believe. What counts as an “assault” is broadly defined by Customs and Border Protection. If a person throws a non-lethal object, such as a rock, at a Border Patrol Agent, that is recorded as an assault. If three people are throwing two types of non-lethal items at two Border Patrol Agents, the counts of assault multiply. In one minor incident, 12 counts of assault can be recorded following this model.
A recent report from the Office of the Inspector General found that 50 percent of assaults recorded between FY 2010 to FY 2017 were from a “Projectile (Rock and Other).” Taking this into consideration, the number of assaults that are lethal in nature drastically declines, portraying a very different image of border safety than the original statistics did. 
The disconnect between the commonly accepted image of danger and the comparatively tranquil reality is captured by Chris Montoya, a former Border Patrol Agent who now works to dismantle misconceptions regarding border safety. 
“The Border Patrol is trapped between myth and reality,” he told me. “By this I mean that there are two competing ideas about border enforcement. On the one hand there are state actors who offer rhetoric that gives the impression that Border Patrol agents are constantly being attacked by criminal migrants. On the other hand, my experience and enforcement data suggest the opposite: that the job of immigration enforcement on the border is one of the safest law enforcement professions that currently exists.”
Montoya uses data to compare state and local agency assault rates to those of the Border Patrol to illustrate his point. When contrasting total assaults, he said: “Border Patrol Agents are about four times less likely to be assaulted when compared to local and state agencies. However, when one excludes projectiles, agents are about seven times less likely to suffer a direct, personal attack than police officers, deputy sheriff’s, and state troopers.” 
The border, then, may not be the bloody and lawless place that the current narrative would lead us to believe. The vast majority of people crossing through patrolled areas are simply looking for a better future and to be reunited with family, according to research by the International Migration Review published earlier this year. Not murderers, not drug traffickers, not extortionists. Just people, like the rest of us, hoping to live stable lives with their loved ones in a way that would not threaten American communities or American federal agents.
As the proposed Border Patrol budget for 2019 increases to $46 billion for the Department of Homeland Security and $16.7 billion for CBP, we must ask what that money is really going toward. If Border Patrol Agents are not constantly struggling against violence, like the administration has stated in order to justify even more funding, what is there to fear? Why is this potential threat prioritized over evidenced threats to American society, such as unaffordable healthcare and a lack of access to clean water, amongst other ailments? And lastly, what is it that drives America’s need to throw dollars toward increasing border militarization –– of which a need has not been proven –– when the majority of people detained will be migrants who carry hope, not drugs? 
It’s time to lift the mirage that has been created to cloak racism and bias toward our southern neighbors. We can’t continue to accept the excuse of danger near the borders as reason to enable their militarization, and as a result, allow documented abuse committed against migrants by Border Patrol, as reported this year by the ACLU, to be overlooked. 
If we look at real, objective evidence, who are the most vulnerable players in this situation? The Border Patrol Agents and American citizens, who have full protection under the law, or the undocumented migrants, who live under the shadow of deportation threats should they choose to speak out against any injustice? 
Maybe the border is dangerous — just not to those we’re made to believe.
