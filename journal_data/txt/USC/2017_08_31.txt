Four years after its inception, the highly touted Iovine and Young Academy will officially become its own school at USC in Spring 2018. This secession from the Roski School of Art and Design will have its own major repercussions, as Dean Erica Muhl’s decision to transfer her leadership to the Academy will leave a vacuum in the art school’s much-needed leadership.
After being the subject of the “USC Seven” scandal — in which all seven MFA students withdrew from the University — and having its Master of Fine Art rankings plummet from No. 36 to No. 69 between 2012 and 2016, Muhl’s departure represents a brand new opportunity for the school to transform its current approach to contemporary arts education. In the past four years during Muhl’s tenure as both the dean of Roski and executive director of Iovine and Young, members of the USC community have observed the disparity between the exclusive cohort of Academy students and other Roski students. 
While the Academy has been cultivated to grow and expand from a 31-person inaugural class in Fall 2014 to its own school and facility on campus, little change or growth has been observed on the west side of campus where Roski resides. The Iovine and Young Academy was created to fuse technology and innovation with the arts to prepare students for a constantly changing contemporary arts scene. They gain practical knowledge in areas like business, engineering and computer science to supplement their fine arts and design experience, allowing them to take their creativity and apply it in the real world. 
On the other hand, Roski students are denied this experience, and the University has made no substantive moves to both address past problems and bring the school into the 21st century. In recent years, Roski students have been forced to pursue their own vocational opportunities outside of Roski through other institutions like the Viterbi School of Engineering, the Marshall School of Business or the School of Cinematic Arts. However, the Academy represented the most comprehensive effort to meld Roski into a program that fits the needs of a changing arts profession. 
Despite efforts to revamp its art program through the recruitment of renowned artists into its faculty and introduction of new Bachelor of Fine Arts and Masters of Fine Arts programs in design, USC administrators and the incoming Roski leadership have a responsibility to transform its current structure through a more holistic approach to arts education. 
The demand for interdisciplinary skills in the workforce is now more prevalent than ever. 
In 2016, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism revamped its journalism major to incorporate the digital and multimedia elements that have revolutionized the field. And in 2017, the School of Dramatic Arts introduced a new bachelor’s degree in musical theatre to accommodate its rising popularity. These schools have shown a dedication to not only their students’ educational pursuits, but also their employability in a constantly changing job market. If other schools at USC are meeting these demands, then so too must the Roski School of Art and Design. 
If it does not modernize, Roski will not be USC that gets left behind in the arts scene — after all, it has the burgeoning Iovine and Young Academy, with the money, technology and resources to succeed. Instead it will be the Roski students. If a significant change does not take place, these same students will be left with broken promises, abandoned by the University that agreed to foster their arts education and prepare them for a modern career in the arts.
USC must capitalize on Iovine and Young’s newfound autonomy to recalibrate Roski’s academic focus. In the months leading up to the appointment of Roski’s new dean, the senior administration and dean selection committee must take into account the unique circumstances that the Roski students will face when they take their first steps in the professional world. 
The new dean of Roski should embody the forward-thinking values that USC applies to every other branch of the arts and humanities. Allowing a subpar program to continue is unacceptable for an educational institution of the caliber that the University aims to be, and meaningful reforms must be made if USC hopes to become a world-class institution in more than just name. 
Daily Trojan Fall 2017 Editorial Board
How about the renowned faculty that fled Roski when Dean Muhl and company gutted the MFA program in 2015? The wanton spending to make up,  quantitatively, for the lack of equal qualitative teaching resources is indicative of the train wreck USC has become under Max Nikias. See Keck School and USC Village for other examples.

Namaste in bed no more. 
This September, CorePower Yoga — one of America’s largest yoga brands — is adding to its 170-plus locations by opening its doors at USC Village. Rooting an intensely physical workout in the mindfulness of yoga, CorePower Yoga is helping college students change their bodies as well as their lives.
Open seven days a week and on holidays from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., CorePower Yoga offers a wide variety of classes, including CorePower Yoga levels 1, 2 and 3 for yogis of varying experience, Hot Yoga for those who want to work up a sweat in classrooms that range from 100-103 degrees, Core Restore for those who need a moment of reflection and many more. 
Each yoga class is designed to work every muscle and emotion.There are classes that suit every student’s needs, no matter their mental and physical states. In addition to the daily class schedule, CorePower Yoga offers a renowned Yoga Teacher Training program, along with special programs including boot camps, retreats and wellness cleanses. Overall, the studio is a one-stop shop, with classes, locker rooms and a yoga shop featuring a selection of men’s and women’s activewear all housed within the unit.
“CorePower Yoga is thrilled to open the USC studio and bring our unique style of yoga to the community here,” said Sophronia Caicedo, studio manager for CorePower Yoga USC Village. “CorePower delivers a workout that is physical and mindful — all in one efficient hour, the perfect combination for people in and around USC who are always on the go.”
Caicedo elaborated on the “community” aspect of CorePower Yoga, saying that patrons can walk in and see both someone who is a complete beginner and someone who has been doing yoga for 10 years, truly making CorePower Yoga a place for yogis of all backgrounds and experiences. 
CorePower Yoga aims to offer classes at an affordable price for college students and USC students are encouraged to take advantage of the studio’s limited-time founding rate on Black Tag Memberships; those who sign up prior to the studio’s opening will receive 25 percent off of a lifetime of yoga classes. The membership also includes unlimited yoga, special workshops, exclusive retail discounts, 20 percent off teacher training and BootCamp and no long-term contract. 
According to Caceido, the rate is the most affordable and advantageous in Los Angeles because of the discount and amenities.
Following the grand opening of the new studio, Black Tag Memberships will begin at $155 a month for standard members. For full-time students, seniors and active military, Black Tag Memberships will cost $129 a month. Otherwise, a single class will cost $25 ($22 with a student discount), five classes will cost $114, 10 classes will cost $209 ($174 with a student discount) and 20 classes will cost $379.
For those unsure about CorePower Yoga or inexperienced in yoga, there’s no reason to bend over backwards (at least not financially) because CorePower Yoga is offering the first week free for new students. 
With its welcoming community and tranquil atmosphere, patrons will find themselves saying “namaste” at CorePower Yoga. 
Does anyone know when they are expected to open?

After working for Universal Music Group for the better part of the past decade, Paul Young, the Thornton School of Music’s new music industry chair, had an epiphany.
“I wasn’t chasing my own passions anymore, even though I had previously defined them,” Young said. “I met every objective I set for myself, but they weren’t necessarily the passions driving me.”
Young walked away from his corporate job in the licensing department at UMG at a point in his career that many of his peers would view as the pinnacle. For him, it was time to chase those passions once more and redefine his future.
“I walked away from it all because I felt disconnected as a musician,” Young said. “I came to USC to get a master’s and doctorate degree in music [by] choice. If you follow your passion, you’re going to wake up every morning with a smile on your face, even if you’re fighting uphill.”
It is this passion and empathy for music that Young instills into his students each and every day. Since being named department chair of Thornton’s music industry program this semester, Young thoroughly emphasizes the interconnectivity of each major within Thornton’s Division of Contemporary Music.
“We have four different degrees within the program, but I fundamentally believe that we all have the same passion for music and it is this that drives us,” Young said. “It is my goal to create a shared experience, because we are all working toward a common outcome. It comes back to the same foundation again and again and again — this industry is based on not only who you know, but who you connect with.”
Young understands the importance of collaborating with likeminded and passionate peers, looking to past relationships for guidance and solitude throughout his career within numerous facets of the music industry.
“I was responsible for millions of dollars every year [while working at UMG], but it always boiled down to what kinds of relationships and what kinds of trusts I built,” Young said. “There should be no hierarchies within relationships, because even when careers are on the line, [the industry] will still lean toward relationships.”
 As for the future of Thornton’s music industry, or MUIN, program, Young looks to build a network of inspired leaders of all ages within the Trojan community. Integrating esteemed USC alumni with current MUIN students, Young hopes to generate the next wave of industry heavyweights.
“It’s important for Music Industry students to understand that they are part of something — the MUIN Trojan community,” Young said. “We have a beautiful alumni network already in place, and it’s really important that these connections are made the right way. We’re going to give the industry that extraordinary candidate who can go into a job with humility and contribute; we’re going to own this town.”
Apart from cultivating the knowledge of MUIN students on a four-year Bachelor of Science track, Young has recently crafted the curriculum for a Master of Science Music Industry degree at USC that will launch in Fall 2018. As a three-semester program, this path is designed for students who did not previously receive a BS degree through Thornton’s music industry program.
“I’m looking forward to building a program apart from our four-year music industry track that has an entirely independent set of goals,” Young said. “It’s not a continuation degree, rather a completely differing experience that will ultimately enable growth at USC and be of value to a lot of people. USC, Thornton and Music Industry are all brands of excellence to me, and I expect my students to be the same — excellent.”
Without knowing what I am talking about, do you guys have a commercial recording studio right there on campus, inside of your teaching facility, with possibilities of going more or less 24 hours a day?

The finale of The Bold Type’s first season will air this upcoming Tuesday on Freeform, marking the end of the first chapter of a series that has changed the game for television aimed at millennial women. The Bold Type, starring the fresh faces of Katie Stevens, Aisha Dee and Meghan Fayh as its leading ladies, is inspired by the life of former Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Joanna Coles, also one of the show’s executive producers. The series tackles a wide array of everyday struggles and triumphs that are universally relatable among today’s young women. 
The summer-chic series has material that appeals broadly to high school students, college students and career women alike. Its storylines and conflicts have involved everything from defining relationships born of spontaneous hook-ups, to negotiating for a higher wage and more appealing responsibilities, to confronting vicious online trolls. But more than anything, the show teaches young, aspiring female journalists the value of their interests and passions, as well as the challenges they’ll face.
Last year in the wake of the election, Teen Vogue, a publication produced for young women, rose to the occasion to produce ambitious, eye-opening political content challenging then-President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Congress enabling him to attack poor people, women, undocumented people and people of color. 
In turn, in December last year, Fox News host Tucker Carlson told Teen Vogue reporter Lauren Duca on air to “stick to the thigh-high boots” instead of covering politics. 
Carlson seemed to be telling Duca that a woman’s work is covering “women’s issues,” and further, that “women’s issues” are exclusively fashion and appearance-related. His words also dealt a grave warning to women that if they write about sex trends and outfits, then going forward, no work they produce on politics, human rights or current events will ever be credible or respectable. 
At a time when female journalists are still encountering overt sexism in their field, The Bold Type offers crucial, much-needed affirmation. 
The show’s three leads include Jane Sloan, an intern-turned-staff writer at Scarlet, a women’s magazine comparable to the real-life Cosmopolitan; Kat Edison, Scarlet’s social media director who uses the magazine’s platform to promote a 21st-century, “stealth” feminist agenda; and Sutton Brady, an editorial-turned-fashion assistant at the fictional magazine. 
The experiences of Sutton’s character highlight the wins and losses of a young woman struggling with college loans, New York City living costs and the demands of a job as tough as it is low-paying. Kat’s character is busy trying to build the magazine’s feminist brand — one that rallies for Muslim and LGBTQ women, tells women their bodies aren’t sex objects and affirms their right to public toplessness. But, perhaps most relevant to today’s modern young female journalists, there’s Jane’s story arc. 
Jane faces it all as a new writer in today’s age of listicles and I-Tried-It-So-You-Don’t-Have-Tos. She reconciles herself with embarrassing and personally challenging pieces she didn’t want, watches her pitches continually denied or given to others, has door after door shut in her face as she chases stories and is forced to fight tooth and nail just to get sources to talk to her. Her work isn’t glamorous — but the show never fails to emphasize in creative and heartwarming ways just how rewarding it is.
By the end of the season, Jane has written about everything from trying new dating apps and the debate about whether to wax or not to wax one’s buttocks, to breast cancer screenings and women in politics. Jane becomes the face of Scarlet’s new political vertical and her prior and subsequent work writing about fashion and dating in no way hamper her news judgment and political acumen. Just as the show aims to destigmatize female sexuality with glimpses into the young women’s nuanced dating lives, it also attacks a media culture that pigeon holes female journalists and narrowly defines and trivializes the umbrella of “women’s issues.” 
Different women are interested in writing about different topics, ranging from sports and business to entertainment and political issues. Writing about one of these issues should not disqualify a woman from sharing her voice and input about another issue. Women should be able to write about sex and fashion one day, and write about how a new federal budget proposal will affect low-income elderly Americans’ living standards the next, just as male journalists and columnists can write about sports games one day and politics the next without being told to “stick to the ol’ pigskin.”
What young women are interested in writing about and reporting on is up to them, and they shouldn’t be sidelined and silenced for being feminine. Their interests, voices and ideas matter and are worthy of respect, and shouldn’t be shut down. This is all part of The Bold Type’s brand of what Kat Edison dubbed “stealth feminism” in the show’s pilot — women reclaiming and redefining small things to make a huge difference.

Los Angeles launders often. Or rather, we launder Los Angeles often. You and I. It’s not a utilitarian thing; LA is always in a ceaselessly perfect summer. We have no reason for our seasoned, seasonal wardrobes. Yet, each day, as sure as seventy degree weather, as sure as rush hour gridlock, we dress and redress with the rest of the city. The whole city does its laundry.
Moving to LA trained me to pay much more attention to what people wear. Superficial might be your description; I think that’s only half true. Maybe we’re materialistic because clothes are just things. But here’s my revelation: things are choices, and we’re made of all the things we choose. Playlists, subscriptions, groceries, bookmarks. Colors, shapes, and patterns we gravitate toward. We’re collages of opinions, portraits of pickiness. Part of this art, our laundry is a canvas too. Clothes are things as well as the literal fabric of our stories.

“Los Angeles has a year-round painting season.” Judy Baca, a renowned local muralist, is talking specifically about LA’s art community, but I argue that you and I and all of the city are our own art and artists. As we dress, we paint. We choose certain lengths, movements, textures, and colors when we put on a blouse. This week, welcome to the Arts District. Here are the coolest walking, talking murals I found.
Mina and Mina
Mina and Mina are best friends from Orange County. They have been sharing names, patterns, and colors for two years. Mina in the black is in around exhibiting her artwork locally (peep her Instagram @minada_design). Naturally, Mina in the white supports her. Yin and yang featuring scarves and smiles. Mina and Mina bought their neckerchiefs together earlier that day from Zara.
Jay and Jeon

I saw Jay’s outfit from across the street. I’m a child, so I knew I had to talk to Jay about his bright colors. 
“I like bright colors,” he says. “And I like t-shirts. And these pink sunglasses. Old-fashioned, but I love it. I bought them in South America—Peru. Only a dollar. Old-school.”

Jay was doing his own photoshoot of Jeon when cross Traction Ave to talk to them. Jeon is wearing a Korean hanbok top, but it’s definitely not traditional. “The traditional ones have long sleeves. This is a fashion hanbok.” Bought in America. New-school.
Meekah, Lost Angeles, Britney the Astronomer, and Sam the Web Developer

Can you guess who’s who? I chatted up this family of outfit misfits after their musical performances at a local gallery show. Meekah (in the cool pants) is a singer, and her music inspires her look. “I have a concept album, Faux Real. It’s a split album. The first half of the album is the ‘fake’ side of me, where I put on this front for everybody. The real side is me being honest. I play on a garden theme where I have both dead flowers and real flowers. Contrast. A lot of contrast.” Find her @meekahmusic.
Lost Angeles, on the left, makes queer synthpop. “I’m Inspired by Lady Gaga and drag queens in general. This is my stab at getting a little political, having fun. I like putting shit on my face.” Lost tweets found @lostangelescity!

Britney and Sam didn’t perform that day, but they still partake in art. Britney is an astronomer who does theater, and Sam plays guitar and develops websites. Coordination was not intended, and neither was the mural behind them. But sometimes, God is good in the city of angels.

Clothes are a portent to their wearer. Fashion has art, craft, and personal branding opportunity. If you don’t care, here’s a thought: though the world loves music and food, it’s a rather special occasion for a musician to play a concert or chef to prepare a full-course dinner. You and I are luckier artists than them. The world loves murals, too, and we’ve got a year-round painting season. We can all be daily special occasions, if we like. Walking, talking murals, if we care.
 

Take care and do your laundry. You’ll hear from me next next Friday.

On Wednesday afternoon, USC unveiled 18 new additions to the USC Athletic Hall of Fame as part of its 2018 class. The group, which includes Trojan legends ranging from football players to a mascot, will be formally announced on Nov. 4 during the Arizona football game at the Coliseum. 
Five former Trojan football players were featured in the 2018 Hall of Fame class, including future NFL Hall of Famer Troy Polamalu, All-American and Butkus Award-winning linebacker Chris Claiborne, along with Trojan legends of the 1960s Rod Sherman and Charlie Weaver. Joining them is J.K. McKay (son of John McKay) who will be inducted for his contributions as a wide receiver on two national championship teams and as a leader of the team’s athletic department from 2010 to 2016. 
Two inductees, Barry Zito and Mike Gillespie, enter the Hall for their contributions to the baseball program, while Sam Clancy is the sole alumnus in the class from the men’s basketball team. Hurdler Felix Sanchez and water polo player Lauren Wenger Trapani both won gold at the 2012 London Olympics before retiring. Meanwhile, volleyball player April Ross and swimmer Ous Mellouli are the only current athletes in the class, both having also medaled in previous Olympic games. 
Former tennis athlete Wayne Black, two-sport star Kim Clark Jennings (soccer and basketball), and golfers Mikaela Parmlid and Kevin Sadler round out the class from the athletics side. Current sports information director Tim Tessalone also joins the class, having served as an SID for the school for over 30 years, working 12 Rose Bowls and over 400 total games in his illustrious career. 
Finally, one non-human joins the 2018 Hall of Fame Class. It is none other than Traveler, USC’s horse mascot who has graced the sidelines of the Coliseum since 1961.

After coming close to taking the NCAA Championship game last season, the men’s water polo team — which opens this season ranked at No. 2 — set its sights on winning it all. Even though they ended last season with a 24-2 record, with only one loss during the regular season, the Trojans hope to win the final game this year, with the national title game at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center in December.
“We are going to try to put everything through the whole year preparing for the one game at the end,” sophomore driver Marin Dasic said. “It definitely is going to be a big motivation because it is going to be our people, our crowd — like Cal had [in the championship game] last year — and at the end they beat us. We didn’t win the last three years, but I think this is the time with our people, with our pool.”
While the Trojans have their end goal in mind already, they have many games to play before achieving it. They will face Cal, perennial championship contender Stanford and many more quality programs throughout the season. But the team has confidence in head coach Jovan Vavic, who is returning for his 23rd season after leading USC to the NCAA title match for the past 12 years.
“Our coaches are unique, and they pick the right people, the right captains, and they know what we have to do,” Dasic said. “They are dedicated, and they are doing everything they can to make us better. I think they have a huge impact on our game and on everything we do.”
With 10 returning seniors, seven of whom are All-Americans, USC is heading into the season with a veteran roster. Along with the seniors, the team also sees the return of all its goalies as well as sophomores like Olympian driver Thomas Dunstan and the 2016 MPSF Newcomer of the Year, 2-meter Matt Maier. This experience allows the team to learn from its mistakes and continue to build upon the foundations already established.
“I think we want to keep the same sort of energy and the same passion that we brought to last season,” senior driver Blake Edwards said.
The returning captain also said the team had to make adjustments after coming up short last year.
“Just a bit of composure when we’re in front and learning how to close out games,” Edwards said. “We had a fantastic record last season, and it just fell apart for us in the last quarter due to some defensive errors, which was really just us switching off.”
USC will hold an edge if the team manages to make another deep postseason run this year. The NCAA Tournament will be held at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center in December, and the Trojans will have their home crowd to help them keep their energy at a high level.
For the seniors, this fall is their last chance to bring home the championship — but more than that, it is a chance to defend their home pool.
“I don’t think I really need to motivate the team,” Edwards said. “I think everyone is hurting from last year’s loss, and I think there’s just a whole lot of excitement within the playing group. There has been a whole lot of hard work put in over the summer, and we are just really looking forward to putting it all together.”
The Trojans will play in the UCLA Mini Invitational this weekend for their season opener. They will be taking on Claremont-Mudd-Scripps at 10:20 a.m. and Pomona-Pitzer at 11:40 a.m. on Saturday.

Brian Chin | Daily Trojan
The Trojans have been fine-tuning in order to stay sharp against Western Michigan for the game on Saturday. With the clock winding down on time, head coach Clay Helton emphasized defensive readiness to prevent the Trojans from falling behind the tempo of the Broncos.
Locking In Third Down
In order to stall Western Michigan’s fast-paced offense, the Trojans practiced situationally, looking to get their opponents off the field as soon as possible.
“We’re really reemphasizing our third downs, which I think are going to be critical, especially defensively,” Helton said. “Looking at tape, obviously this is a team that can be a no-huddle team … being able to get off the field defensively where those plays don’t climb up.”
The defense set up at the 50-yard line and worked on third down situations with varying yardage. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold took shots down the field and threw short passes to keep the defense guessing. 
Special Teams 
Special teams had ample opportunity to work on defending punt returns in order to better defend Western Michigan wideout Darius Phillips on Saturday. 
“Continue watching tapes, [and] you see how dangerous Darius Phillips is and why he was the Special Teams Player of the Year last year,” Helton said. “He is not only one that can make you miss, but if he gets behind coverage, he’s gone.”
In order to be ready, USC spent a portion of practice kicking the ball to both hashes and attempting to run it back through heavy coverage.
Well-Oiled Offense
In order to get in the right mindset, the team worked on dealing with pressure in the pocket. Darnold spent time working on quick releases backed up within the 10-yard line, forcing him to think on his feet and improvise when necessary. 
The offense also worked on tightening up its short passes on different down and yardage situations. Darnold dumped the ball off through well-timed short distance passes, keeping the defense on its toes. The running backs also had an opportunity to make plays by creating space in the coverage.
Smith suspension confirmed
Due to his targeting ejection in the second half of the Penn State game, junior linebacker Cameron Smith will be suspended for the first half of Saturday’s opener.
“By rule he’s allowed to be a part of pre-game warm up,” Helton said. “After we go in, he’s not allowed to come out until the second half.”
As a result, the bench will have to step up and fill the position. Helton feels confident that the Trojans will be able to hold their own despite Smith’s absence. 
“Obviously, [sophomore] Jordan [Iosefa] will play Mike linebacker, and [redshirt sophomore] John [Houston Jr.] will be the Will linebacker for that first half,” Helton said. “We’ll have [freshman] Levi [Jones] ready if needed, along with [redshirt junior] Grant Moore.”
Smith was upset by the decision, but he ultimately feels his teammates are prepared enough to hold the position until he can return.
“I’ll probably pace around a little bit [and] stress out,” Smith said. “Hopefully, someone will be there to calm me down.”
Injury Update
Senior right guard Viane Talamaivao played a full practice on Wednesday. According to Helton, he is in good shape for Saturday’s game.

At first glance, it appears as though Pac-12 football lags far behind fellow Power Five conferences. Over the past ten years, the league has struggled to produce as many draft picks as the SEC, ACC and Big Ten. In terms of television deals, the struggling Pac-12 Network is projected to make less revenue than the SEC, Big Ten and Big 12 Networks in 2017 according to a report by The Mercury News. Meanwhile, the Pac-12 has not won a national championship since USC in 2004 — the longest drought among major conferences (and even that title was vacated due to NCAA violations). 
But despite the conference’s period of downturn, 2017 is setting up to be a pivotal turnaround year (let’s conveniently ignore Oregon State’s embarrassing loss to Colorado State last week). The Pac-12 enters this football season with a bevy of talented quarterbacks, a collection of the nation’s brightest coaches and a solid group of teams that gives the league more depth than it has ever seen in this decade. Come bowl season, the conference will finally end up joining the discussion about the nation’s best. 
It is no secret that college football success starts with superb coaching. Star players may come and go in three- to four-year increments, but with a solid system in place, programs can win consistently, even during rebuilding seasons. Just look at the sudden difference head coach Jim Harbaugh made at Michigan.
This year, the Pac-12 features an excellent lineup of head coaches. Kyle Whittingham (Utah), Mike Leach (Washington State) and Rich Rodriguez (Arizona) all bring immense experience and a level of stability to historically mediocre programs. USC head coach Clay Helton and Colorado’s Mike MacIntyre both enjoyed breakout years in 2016 and will look to carry over their momentum into this season. In the North Division, Stanford’s David Shaw has had five 10-win seasons in six years, while Chris Peterson took just three years to transform Washington into a College Football Playoff team. Joining them is Willie Taggert, who replaces Mark Helfrich at Oregon. The Harbaugh disciple promised to dumb down the team’s over-the-top uniform combinations and  — more importantly — rehabilitate the program just like he did at Western Kentucky and South Florida. Aside from a downward-trending Jim Mora at UCLA and Cal’s questionable hire of Justin Wilcox, the Pac-12 possesses perhaps the best coaching in all of college football. 
If good coaching is the most important ingredient for college football success, possessing a solid signal caller behind center is a close second. Luckily for the Pac-12, its teams’ rosters feature a number of elite quarterbacks. In Walter Football’s 2018 NFL Draft rankings, four of its top 15 quarterback prospects compete out West, the most of any conference.
Those four — UCLA’s Josh Rosen, Washington State’s Luke Falk, Washington’s Jake Browning and, of course, the Trojans’ redshirt sophomore signal caller Sam Darnold — all have a chance to contend for the Heisman Trophy and start on Sundays in the near future. Outside of that quartet, Arizona quarterback Brandon Dawkins is poised for a 2,000-yard passing, 1,000-yard rushing season, and Oregon’s Justin Herbert is likely to improve upon a quietly excellent freshman year. When it comes to quarterback play, one thing is clear: No conference comes close to the Pac-12.
Since the Pac-12 held its first championship game in 2011, the conference has been dominated by elite teams from three schools in the North Division (the North is 6-0 in the championship game). It is no longer so top-heavy. No. 8 Washington, the defending conference champ, and No. 14 Stanford remain national contenders, but No. 4 USC appears more than capable of ending the North’s streak.
At the same time, No. 24 Washington State, Utah, UCLA and Colorado all bring talented rosters to the conversation. At the Pac-12 Media Days in July, commissioner Larry Scott said that this year’s eventual conference champion “is going to be tested like no other.”
He could not be more correct. The Pac-12 will be a bloodbath this year, and whoever ends up winning the title in Levi’s Stadium will have an impressive resume worthy of College Football Playoff consideration. Last bowl season was supposed to be the Pac-12’s coming out party, showcasing how deep the league had become. It didn’t exactly unfold that way (the conference finished 3-3 in bowls), but now, a year later, with more experienced rosters and players, it’s finally time for the conference to break out. 
It will not take long to see if the Pac-12 is indeed for real this season. In Week 1, UCLA hosts the SEC’s Texas A&M. In Week 2, Oregon plays Nebraska from the Big Ten. And in Week 3, the Trojans host Big 12 powerhouse Texas. It’s a make-or-break year for a conference that has fallen short for over a decade. The difference now is that it can no longer afford to break.

The Office for Residential Education released the “USC Residential Experience” smartphone app this semester to further inform students of events and updates throughout the academic year. The app allows students living in residential colleges to keep track of upcoming events such as Cardinal and Gold events and compete with other students in their residential college to win monthly prizes, such as August’s prize of a $25 gift card to the USC Bookstore. 
Residential Education Director Emily Sandoval said that the creators were looking to create a gamification of the residential experience, when developing the app.
Students can earn points by attending residential education events, which contribute to their level on the app, and those with the most points within their residential college win the monthly prizes. Students can also earn badges by attending certain types of events — for example, the “Urban Explorer” badge can be earned by attending five off-campus events. 
“When I look at some of our counterparts regionally, there are residential education departments [with] more resource-based apps,” Sandoval said. “I have not found one that is the gamification of the residential experience, so I like to think we’re at the forefront and we’re being innovative with that.”
Noah Gladden, a freshman majoring in astronautical engineering, enjoys the gamified aspects of the app. 
“I’ve looked at [the] levels and badges a lot and the leaderboard probably the most,” Gladden said. “I liked the levels and badges, the way it’s set up — it’s cool and nice. I also like that you can make an avatar in the app.” 
Students living in the first-year residential colleges can also view the Residential College Cup Leaderboard in the app to track their college’s standing in the cup instead of relying only on the mounted screens at the entrances to their residential colleges. 
Residential Education worked with developer Urban Insight throughout the 2016-2017 school year to create the app, Sandoval said. 
“We developed all the content. Urban Insight designed the look,” Sandoval said. “We had a group of students that were our focus group, so we met with the students and our staff about four times throughout the year, and they were giving us direct input [on how it should look].” 
Although the app was released a few weeks ago, Residential Education is still working with Urban Insight to solve bugs that students have reported in the app. 
“[There’s] some latency between when you go to an event and when you get points for it,” Gladden said. “Also, I think the biggest problem, it says ‘unknown housing’ at the top [when I open the app], so I don’t really know if my points are going to the right place.”
Sandoval said that with any app, bugs are to be expected when it’s first released, but that it will keep improving in the weeks to come as they solve problems that arise during use. 
Residential Education also has a “wish list” for a second version of the app, which the organization hopes to develop in early 2018 and release next fall. 
Assistant Director for North and South Residential Colleges Derek Murakami has worked closely on the app since he joined the Office of Residential Education in March. 
“A pretty big wish list item would be GPS, so if you are on campus, maybe near an event … you get a GPS notification [telling you that] an event is happening near you and if you would like to go,” Murakami said. 
One of the features that students find useful about the app is its informational abilities to help them see upcoming events easily. 
“I really like the app because it’s a great way to motivate people to actually go to the events and meet new people,” said Athira Pratap, a freshman majoring in neuroscience. “It’s cool because it shows which activities are coming up, so it’s an easy way to check.” 
In the past, Residential Education has used Facebook, fliers and weekly emails to inform students about events. 
“The app makes it more instantaneous,” Sandoval said. “You have it at the press of a button.” 
According to Sandoval, 1,359 students have already downloaded the app as of Monday, but Residential Education is planning an advertising campaign in the coming weeks to raise awareness about the app’s features. 
Ultimately, Murakami and Sandoval hope that the app can keep students engaged and involved with their residential community. 
“What we would love to hear from students is that it helped them connect to USC as a whole, as well as their smaller residential community that they’re a part of, “Murakami said.  “That they found students who would attend programs or events with them, that it helped them feel like they were a part of something bigger than just the room that they live in on campus.”

In the wake of terror attacks in Europe this summer, tensions have risen in the international community as countries around the world face a daunting task : counteracting violent acts organized by terrorist groups. 
On Wednesday, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted an event to discuss how social networks have become platforms for extremist organizations to spread their agenda, and what can be done to counter this shift. 
“The number of people espousing hate on social media is rising,” said Todd Helmus, a senior behavioral scientist from the Research and Development Corporation.
Helmus and Erroll Southers, a professor in the practice of governance at the Price School of Public Policy, led the conversation.
Helmus, who specializes in Countering Violent Extremism, or CVE, defined it as a field that focuses on proactive actions to counter efforts by extremists to recruit, radicalize and mobilize followers to violence. He explained that observing the rise and fall of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria can allow researchers to understand the challenges of countering extremism online. 
ISIS, Helmus said, is the first extremist group to use new media technologies on such a grand scale. He explained that the group’s use of Twitter, among other factors, was instrumental in allowing it to reach out to the public in ways that no other terrorist group previously had.
A major turning point, Helmus said, was when Twitter began to remove pro-ISIS accounts. This significantly reduced the flow of pro-ISIS content on social media. Several groups and organizations are also working to eradicate ISIS’ ideology, from anti-extremist production companies to community outreach programs.
“Having a local approach means that culture is always baked in,” Helmus said. 
Helmus added that a problem with some earlier attempts to counter extremism was that organizations and the U.S. government did not have an approach that was sufficiently refined. Southers noted that program workers were not attached to the communities and therefore could not reach their audience as effectively. 
“The Somali-American community in Minneapolis is very different than the one in Columbus, Ohio,” Southers said.
Helmus cited movement to private messaging apps, which is much more difficult, if not impossible, to intercept. He added that many have also voiced concerns about the anti-extremist programs, saying that they are too focused on Muslims.
Helmus added that both  right-wing and left-wing extremists in the United States are growing bolder online.
This issue, Helmus explained, has not received enough attention and funding. 
Technology companies, however, are beginning to help address these new issues. Twitter, for example, is moving toward removing racist content on its platform, according to Helmus.
Ultimately, Southers said, the bigger modern threat might be white nationalists. 
“They are now outperforming ISIS in every social metric online, both in Twitter follower accounts and tweets per day,” Southers said.

With the end of construction at USC Village, the University’s next changes are taking place from the palms of students’ hands.
USC is issuing updated USCards to new and returning students this fall as it looks to replace traditional magnetic strips, according to Student Account Services.
“[This new technology] requires the cardholder to just wave or tap the ID card at the reader to gain entry to both the exterior doors of University buildings and the interior bedroom doors in apartments and dorms,” SAS Director Peter Tom said. 
Updated USCards will include both the magnetic strip and proximity chip. The built-in chip allows entry into remodeled buildings or rooms with new proximity card readers. 
Administrative staff can enter limited-access rooms or buildings after hours, such as the Engemann Student Health Center or Wallis Annenberg Hall. Students who require special access to designated rooms can be granted entry via the chip as well. 
There are over 50 buildings that have installed a full proximity card reader or a combination of both card readers, Tom said.
Ahead of the 2017-2018 school year, USCard proactively notified returning students assigned to USC Village last spring that they would need to change their card. This process alleviated the burden ahead of move-in day. 
“If an individual needs a new ID card because the building or facility requires the use of a proximity card, they can change out the current ID card,” Tom said. “However, they must bring in their current ID card to initiate the exchange.”
Students can find the official USCard app, which was launched in summer 2016, on the App Store and Google Play Store. After logging in their USCard account, they may use the app to add discretionary dollars, check their meal plan balance, present a digital copy of their ID or deactivate a lost or stolen card.
USCard issued just under 20,000 ID cards to students, faculty, staff, guests and visiting scholars last year, and Tom said he anticipates issuing about 15 percent more [cards] this year due to the higher use of proximity card readers.

Design@USC, the Iovine and Young Academy’s new interactive online Master of Science program aims to change the way students access online education.
The 38-unit program has already has enrolled 28 students for fall 2017. It is the first master’s program offered by the Iovine and Young Academy and is one of several online degree programs offered at USC.
Through its contemporary and interactive approach, students learn interdisciplinary skills in design, business and technology in a highly technological environment. 
“We wanted something different, something outside of the box and more applicable to the current industry and climate where it’s beneficial, if not crucial, to have more than one discipline and perspective,” said Patrick Dent, associate professor and chair of technology and engineering for the Iovine and Young Academy.
According to Dent, the goal of the online program is to take working professionals and make them more effective in the industry they’re already in by mastering additional disciplines, leading team-based projects and giving students the skills they need to create their own startup project and a team from scratch.
USC Roski School of Art and Design Dean Erica Muhl spearheaded the development of Design@USC along with music industry entrepreneurs Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young, otherwise known as Dr. Dre. 
After her deanship at Roski expires in early 2018, Muhl will transition to the Iovine and Young Academy as the school’s inaugural dean.
Dent describes the online structure of the curriculum as “Brady Brunch-type” screen pods or an advanced version of 18-to-30 person Skype sessions, with break-out rooms for team building exercises. 
In addition, the program also offers offline components of more traditional, pre-taped lectures with a few interactive elements such as polls and research.
“The idea is that the live is kind of a cross between a lecture, a lab and a discussion where you’re trying to leverage the advantages of having all of us together live at the same time, as opposed to the traditional lectures, which can be watched at whatever time is most convenient,” Dent said.
The program will enroll a mix of recent graduates and working professionals. Applicant qualifications for prospective students parallel the academic rigor of Iovine and Young’s undergraduate application, both of which require pitching an idea for a product, concept or project. If accepted into the program, students can work to bring their initial application pitch to fruition if they choose.
“The same way Dean Muhl had an innovative and disruptive approach to the Iovine and Young undergraduate program, she also wanted to create a graduate program that pushed the boundaries of what we think of as online education,” Dent said.

Provost Michael Quick pledged the University’s support to Hurricane Harvey victims in southeastern United States in a memorandum sent Wednesday morning to the USC community. 
Quick released the memo after nearly 30 people have died due to the flooding in Texas, Louisiana and other regions along the Gulf Coast, according to Texas officials. The Category Four hurricane has caused severe structural damage and limited access to clean water and electricity, according to the National Hurricane Center. 
The exact number of injuries and deaths remains unknown. 
In the memo, Quick noted the dedication of the first responders and emphasized the University’s efforts to support any students, alumni, faculty and staff affected by the hurricane as relief efforts continue. 
“We want you to know that we are here to support you during this difficult time and in the months to come as recovery efforts get underway,” he wrote.   
Quick invited USC community members to contact the University or the Student Support and Advocacy staff team if they are need of help. 
He also invited students to contact Student Counseling Services or the Center for Work & Family Life for emotional support.

Located in the heart of USC Village, SunLife Organics’ lotus logo entices passers-by with its wide-open doors and brightly lit interior filled with pop music, people and the whir of blenders at work. The store contains wooden, rustic-themed décor, complete with hanging plants and energy crystals that elicit a quintessential Southern California vibe, and boasts a menu of plant-based juices, protein shakes, acai bowls, smoothies and coffee.       
Despite the shop’s “be here now” beachy atmosphere, its drinks lack refreshing flavors and its overpriced bowls are disappointingly low in quality compared to local competitors Amazebowls and Nekter, which both offer cheaper, healthier options. Compared to organic competitors in Southern California such as Blue Bowls in Orange County, SunLife’s products — which range from $8 to $16 for bowls with specialty ingredients — are ridiculously overpriced for a college student’s budget, even with its organic, locally sourced branding. 
The shop’s customer service also needs improvement: Workers appear disorganized and uninterested, as a customer walks up to the glass barrier to inquire about her order, which was seemingly skipped over as others before her received their items. The cashier engaged in a long conversation with earlier customers, holding up the line, only to grant the rest of the waiting guests a snappy, 30-second interaction during which they merely recited orders. The wait time was around five to 12 minutes, depending on the time of day and the level of activity in the store.  
SunLife’s Brazilian-style and Trojan bowls are nothing out of the ordinary and arguably too simple to be priced at $10.95 and $14.95, respectively. The Brazilian consists of the most basic ingredients of an acai bowl: acai, banana, blueberry, almond milk and apple juice, topped with an overly generous half-cup scoop of regular granola to add dimension to a half-filled bowl.
Annalise Pasztor | Daily Trojan
Bananas and strawberries, coated with coconut and a dash of hemp seeds, are added on top of the granola – ingredients that are not Brazilian style (except the acai and banana), but rather basic. The acai blend should be rebranded as its own smoothie; underneath the impenetrable layer of granola is a goopy, dark purple, semi-solid liquid. 
The Trojan bowl, with coconut meat, coconut butter and mango in its blend, is redeemable with its more solid mixture, but the light sprinkle of goji berries and bee pollen are a half-hearted effort to make the bowl taste unique. Instead, the berries are an overwhelmingly sweet addition to the fruit blend and plentiful layer of granola.
The Goldie bowl, which references Goldilocks and her love for oatmeal, does not do the fairytale justice. The base is made of a pre-made, packaged oatmeal mix, evident from a worker visibly cutting open a packet while preparing the bowl, and is simply topped with blueberries, bananas and strawberries. The bowl does not even fill up to the top of the container and the amount of fruit given is easily finished before the oatmeal, leaving patrons with an uneven oatmeal-to-topping ratio toward the end of the bowl.
The protein shakes, all priced at $8.95, consist of basic ingredients like vegan protein, non-dairy milk and banana for loose shakes that are both protein-packed and pricey. The juices are decently priced compared to the L.A. juicery scene, and Sunlife’s customizable options allow for flexibility in choosing juice add-ons and bases.
SunLife Organics is receiving ill-deserved hype because of its strategic location, and its expensive menu falls out of the price range for most students living on a budget; ultimately, it is not worthy of a weekly spending splurge. Despite the owner’s healthful mission, SunLife Organics at USC Village compromises on the business’ commitment to quality and its marketed natural, healthy products can be easily replicated at home at a more affordable and sustainable price.

A mere two and a half months after its blistering debut studio album Saturation, hip-hop collective BROCKHAMPTON, dubbed “the internet’s first boy band,” is back with a stellar follow-up project Saturation II. The group, helmed by lead singer Kevin Abstract, features an incredibly skilled team of 15 in-house rappers, writers, producers and creative directors, as well as a seemingly endless supply of raw talent. Created online in a Kanye West fan forum, the group later relocated to a house in South Central Los Angeles, and has been churning out exhilarating and high quality music at an impressive pace ever since. 
Saturation II is supported by the four singles “Gummy,” “Swamp,” “Junky” and “Sweet,” all of which are accompanied by music videos directed by Abstract (each song title is exactly five letters long, with the exception of the closing track).
The album opens up with hard-hitting tracks “Gummy” and “Queer.” The latter track features a gritty, industrial instrumental with fantastic flows from members Matt Champion, Merlyn Wood and Dom McLennon. Champion and Abstract carry the chorus together, which comes up abruptly at a slower, yet still exciting pace: “Don’t go runnin’ your mouth, don’t go runnin’ your mouth,” Champion raps. 
“Teeth” serves as a short interlude with haunting falsettos looped behind a fiery verse from singer Ameer Vann: “I done been in trouble, ‘bout as long as I remember / My momma tried to help me, but I hardly ever listened / So she sent me to them white schools, I learned that I was different.” Throughout the project, Vann muses on topics of racial identity, specifically the struggle to fit in as an African American musician in a predominantly white, affluent community.

The track “Tokyo” opens up with singer Russell “JOBA” Boring rapping and singing in his signature biting falsetto, leading up to a chorus led by Abstract under the guise of pitched-up vocals.  Abstract and other members’ vocals are pitched up multiple times throughout the project, making the album’s track listing exciting, though unpredictable at times. 
“Jesus” is the first real slow jam on the album, featuring Abstract singing about a failed relationship, with Ciaran “bearface.” McDonald joining in to croon about a bygone relationship. Each of the singles on the album has a ridiculously catchy and sticky hook — all earworms that are extremely unique and high energy. 
In the standout single “Junky,” each member confronts his personal struggles. The song opens with an aggressive verse from Abstract about the challenges of being an openly gay figure in the hip-hop community: “I do the most for the culture, n—-, by just existing.” Singer William “Merlyn” Wood delivers the most thrilling verse of the song — and one of the best on the album — all from a bathtub full of Fruit Loops, as seen in the music video: “I just want to appeal to my dad and my cousins / So I forgive my mommy, daddy, auntie and my uncles or guilt-tripping feelings whenever they call my number.” Despite the seriousness of the subject matter, Merlyn’s flow is so infectiously bouncy that listeners can’t help but bob their heads. 
Production on the album is mainly controlled by immensely talented in-house producer Romil Hemnani, with additional help from production duo Q3 — consisting of producers Jabari Manwa and Isaiah Merriweather — and Brockhampton members bearface., Abstract and JOBA. However, tracks “Sweet,” “Swamp” and “Queer” all open with a four-count beat, paying homage to Hemnani’s admiration of Pharrell Williams. Throughout Saturation II, Hemnani utilizes pitch changes, lead synths and uncompromising drum beats.
The last couple of songs on the album mark a shift in tone. The song “Sunny” features a series of beautifully lazy guitar chords overlapping with Wood’s high-pitched yells and shouts: They perfectly contrast with the mood of the instrumentation, followed later by wonderfully melodic harmonizations. 
The track concludes with members bearface. and JOBA belting out high notes in synchronization, accompanied by beautiful strings in the background. The last track, “Summer” follows the summery theme created by “Sunny” — the song is a power ballad, spearheaded by vocals from bearface. and complemented by fantastic guitar work. 
Saturation II is a raw, personal and emotional album — at times overwhelmingly aggressive, at others somber and introspective. The heart that each and every Brockhampton member put into this album is real and palpable in every song. Brockhampton is uncompromising in every aspect of its vision, and in doing so, it has  emerged as one of the most exciting and unique forces in contemporary hip-hop.
