February marks the one year anniversary of the opening of USC’s London international office. Since its opening in February 2018, the USC London Office, located in Bedford Square, has been a hub for recruiting students and growing networks.
According to Paulo Rodrigues, associate vice provost for global engagement, the office has expanded its programming and engagement since its opening and has worked on establishing the University’s relationships with institutions in the United Kingdom and throughout the European Union. 
“We have been focused on expanding institutional relationships throughout the UK and EU
as well as supporting the efforts of various USC Schools,” Rodrigues wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Locally, we engage in regular meetings and discussions with universities, government agencies, private sector companies and NGO’s for different projects of interest to USC Schools and faculty.”
Rodrigues said part of the expansion of the London office includes increasing relationships with schools such as the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism to grow partnerships between the University Park Campus and prospective international students. 
“We consistently meet with many USC Schools to identify, support and grow projects and partnerships,” Rodrigues said. “The Office has also focused on initiatives to raise awareness about USC with an increasing presence on social media platforms and through a monthly newsletter that reaches thousands of prospective students, alumni and stakeholders for USC in the UK and Europe.”
Katy Kelly, assistant director of International Programs at Annenberg, said the office has helped send Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism students to London to study government and public affairs reporting under Wallis Annenberg Chair in Journalism and Communication Afua Hirsch, an award-winning British journalist and social critic. 
“The USC London office has become a valued partner in supporting these initiatives and the students during their time in London,” Kelly wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
The London Office has also supported a joint masters degree in global communication and global media offered by Annenberg and the London School of Economics.
Rodrigues said USC is becoming more recognized as a “top-tier” university by many European students and, for the past year, the office has been able to provide an effective touchpoint for European students. 
“The [office] supports undergraduate and graduate admissions in many ways, most notably by nurturing relationships with local institutions, participating in college fairs, and fielding regular requests for information,” Rodrigues said.
In a USC News release last year, former president C. L. Max Nikias said he hoped the London Office would act as a headquarters for all of USC’s European affairs.  
“[The office] will play a vital role in helping us achieve USC’s ambition of attracting the world’s most talented and creative students,” Nikias wrote. “The USC community is looking forward to continue building upon the already-established relationships and partnerships there.”
James Farrell, associate director of the London Office, said the office has been consistently expanding since its opening in February. 
“It is great to see the USC London Office go from strength to strength since its launch last year,” Farrell said. “We have received a warm welcome in the UK and are fast becoming part of the conversation in the UK’s higher education sector.”
The London Office regularly hosts “Introduction to USC” seminars for prospective students and parents. These events allow families in the UK to visit the office, learn about USC and ask questions. 
Rodrigues said the London Office has connected students with with current alumni. A new alumni mentorship initiative pairs visiting undergraduates with USC alumni living in the UK to strengthen the Trojan network and provide professional opportunities abroad. The office also partners with the USC Alumni Club of London for SCend Off events.

A camera crew sets up equipment in the middle of a rural village in India. They move swiftly around the area, recording as young women and girls walk excitedly away from a small industrial machine with newly made menstrual pads in hand. The crew was filming “Period. End of Sentence” — now an Oscar-winning short film.
School of Cinematic Arts alumna Rayka Zehtabchi directed the film and SCA alumna Melissa Berton and current graduate student Helen Yenser produced the film. They won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject Sunday night. “Period. End of Sentence” was produced in collaboration with the Pad Project, a nonprofit organization that sends pad-making machines to communities in underdeveloped countries. The organization was originally created by Yenser and supported by her mother, Berton. 
“I’m not crying because I am on my period or anything,” Zehtabchi said during her acceptance speech at the Oscars. “I can’t believe a film about menstruation just won an Oscar.”
The documentary follows the implementation of a pad-making machine in the rural village of Hapur District outside of Delhi, India. It depicts the stigma surrounding menstruation in the village and the negative effects it can have on young girls who don’t have access to menstrual products. 
According to Zehtabchi, the filmmakers wanted to highlight women’s struggles to survive in a culture where menstruation is a taboo subject.
“You really don’t realize how detrimental this taboo [is] and the shame around menstruation until you really start talking to women and seeing what they experience every single month,” Zehtabchi said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Zehtabchi attributes her success to the professors and fellows at SCA who supported her during the filmmaking process.
“My first phone call went out to Rachel Ward, who was my producing professor … and Rachel had just finished producing a film in India,” Zehtabchi said. “She was on the phone with me for a couple of hours just trying to help connect me with people in India and trying to give me the best word of advice that she possibly could.” 
During the Oscars ceremony, Berton told reporters backstage about its subjects’ reactions to the film.
“The women in the village were [one of] the first audiences to actually see the finished film … and they really felt proud of how they came across,” Berton said. “We’ve been talking to them all week because they’re here, and this has made a lot of change for them.”
Zehtabchi hopes the film will educate people about the lack of menstrual product accessibility and spark conversation about menstruation in developing countries.
“I’m very interested in [the] period movement now and … I really believe that we need to continue to spread awareness about this issue,” Zehtabchi said. “Our film focuses on a very specific small village in India, but there are millions of stories worldwide around menstruation and women’s experiences … that I still think need to be told.” 
Zehtabchi said winning the Oscar has drawn international attention to the issues depicted in the film.
“Because of the film’s release, we’ve installed two more pad machines in neighboring villages,” Zehtabchi said. “I know for a fact that since we released on Netflix and since the Oscar, there’s been an insane number of donations to the Pad Project.” 
Yenser, one of the film’s producers, is also celebrating the Oscar victory.
“I could never have pictured it seven years ago, when I started the movement as a high school student with my mom,” Yenser wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Now I’m in graduate school for writing in film and television. It’s been a wild journey, and I’m grateful for every minute of it.”

USC’s Inter-Health Council hosted its first-ever Student Health Town Hall at Doheny Memorial Library Wednesday, which featured topics like mental health resources, training for inclusive health care and sexual health resources. The event was a student-organized conversation between students and Engemann officials that drew nearly 100 students, faculty and staff. 
Chief health officer Sarah Van Orman, co-medical Director Mildred Wenger, gynecologist Deirdre Logan and staff psychologist Kelly Greco made up the panel. Political science professor Alison Dundes Renteln and health communication lecturer Nazli Senyuva moderated the discussion. 
Inter-Health Council Inter-Club Relations Chair Yannie Hoang introduced the panelists and explained that the event’s purpose was for student voices to be heard. She also thanked the event’s co-sponsors, which included the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly and the Academic Culture Assembly. 
Mai Mizuno, a senior and an alleged victim of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall’s alleged sexual abuse, opened the town hall by explaining that students like her have lost trust in USC Student Health because of sexual harassment allegations that have come out in the past year. 
“I am not here today to point fingers or rail on the University … but to help provide a richer picture for our panelists as to why students are unwilling to believe words that are not backed up by action,” said Mizuno, who is majoring in international relations and philosophy, politics and law.
During the discussion, panelists took questions from the audience and from an online form that students could submit to before and during the event. 
Students expressed concern with mental health services at the University, such as long wait times for appointments and a low counselor-to-student ratio. Because of this, students said they are often referred off campus to receive treatment. They said they have to find ways to pay for transportation and other fees, and they are sometimes referred to clinics that are fully booked or no longer in business. 
“We agree 100 percent, and I agree 100 percent,” Van Orman said. “The number of staff that we had in our counseling and mental health services was not adequate for our students and what it resulted in was long wait times … and many students being told to go off campus.”
Van Orman said USC Student Health will hire 12 new clinicians by Fall 2019, bringing Engemann’s total to 35 psychologists and therapists. She said the Student Health Center will build a fifth floor by Fall 2019 that will house mental health services for students, so they can receive counseling and treatment on campus. 
“We are hopeful that by some time next year, students won’t have to be referred out of the University, that they’ll be able to be referred to a Keck Department of Psychiatry clinic right on campus, right in the Engemann building,” Van Orman told the Daily Trojan. 
Logan discussed some of the changes implemented to gynecologic visits earlier this academic year, including that all students receiving sensitive exams must be accompanied by a chaperone. Students going into these exams will also be provided a laminated booklet, currently available in English and Chinese that explain the procedures, Logan said. 
Logan also said Engemann faculty will undergo training to learn to work with people from diverse communities  to ensure that all patients feel comfortable. 
“Many of us don’t have the right terminology,” Logan said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Many of us maybe don’t have the correct level of sensitivity, and we are working on bringing that training in for everyone.” 
Students also asked questions about submitting complaints regarding their Student Health experiences and transparency in seeing such concerns resolved. Wenger said that if students feel uncomfortable with their providers, they can leave anonymous feedback that will be reviewed and acted upon. 
“I feel really confident in the system we have, but we need to continue to look for ways to tell every patient how they can share a concern and then more importantly, continue to share what we do with those,” Van Orman said. 
Some students expressed that they were unaware of various services or new initiatives that the panelists discussed and suggested USC Student Health work to increase awareness among other departments, academic advisers and students. 
“There are many issues that students are having that we on the medical side are not aware of, and there are many things that we are doing on the medical side that students aren’t aware of,” Logan said. “Communication is key, and I think the more that we conversate and meet with one another, the better we’ll be able to move forward in a way that benefits everyone.”
Dundes Renteln took notes on students’ concerns during the meeting and said she and some of her colleagues plan to write a letter to University administration detailing urgent issues in the student community. 
“I think the faculty want to be like intermediaries or culture brokers,” Dundes Renteln said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We’re here to facilitate the conversation. It’s not for us to decide what should happen, but we want to help the students voice the concerns and help these new leaders handle this massive bureaucracy.”
Mizuno said she heard about many positive changes at Engemann that she didn’t know about before, but that more students need to be made aware of these changes. 
“Regardless of all these changes, what is the point … if students aren’t aware of them?” Mizuno told the Daily Trojan in an interview. “I think we need to continue to have these conversations so that students are aware of these different resources because ultimately … we have the most to gain and the most to lose from this.”

This Tuesday, Fox Home Entertainment invited viewers to a screening of “The Hate U Give,” a film adapted from a young adult novel of the same title, and a Q&A with actor Russell Hornsby, who played Maverick Carter in the film, at James Bridges Theater at UCLA. 
USC Center for the Political Future fellow Symone Sanders, who moderated the Q&A, spoke with Hornsby about the film and its cultural implications following the screening. 
The film follows Starr Carter, a high school girl whose world is turned upside down when her childhood best friend Khalil Harris is shot by the police. Hornsby plays Starr’s father, an ex-drug dealer who will stop at nothing to protect his family. 
Hornsby has a wealth of acting experience ranging from ABC’s “Lincoln Heights” to movies such as “Fences” and “Creed II.” His most recent venture is the television show “Proven Innocent,” whose pilot episode aired Feb. 15. 
During the Q&A, Hornsby said he felt his character represented black men in America and all of the individual male role models that helped shape him into who he is today. 
“Maverick Carter is a representation of the brothers who helped raise me,” Hornsby said. “You know, you’re talking about your coaches, [talking] about your uncles, teachers, all of those things … When you get older, you’re learning more about what is it to be black, what it is to be black in America, how we’re treated, how we’re mistreated and then that starts to take a toll on you.”
The conversation then shifted to the opening scene — a shot of everyone in the neighborhood playing outside and pans into the Carter family house in which Maverick, his wife and his three children are sitting around the kitchen table having “the talk” about what to do when a police car stops you. Hornsby said he remembered moments from his own childhood when his mother would remind him to exercise caution because he was a black boy. But in the film, Hornsby thought “the talk” was executed much more poetically. 
“I think it’s deeply profound that we have this black nuclear family, sitting at the table, the father at the helm with all of his transgressions behind him,” Hornsby said. “He can still be a man who’s been to prison, been to jail. You look at him, you can tell this brother got something with him, but he’s still so present and ready too, like [he cares] enough about his family to sit with them lovingly with some care and compassion to say to his children, ‘Let’s be mindful about what’s out there because I do love you.’”
Hornsby also said the film gives the audience the chance to feel again, as he believes people have become desensitized due to images of gun violence in the news. 
“The first step is coming here and being present in this theater tonight, right?” Hornsby said. “And taking a moment to feel again. That’s going to expand to everything else once we open this heart up, once we open our spirit, once we’re touched. That begins the opening of our minds to think differently. To consider different ideas and different thoughts and different kinds of conversation.”
Hornsby also discussed what “The Hate U Give” means for the future of filmmaking, specifically how more diverse and inclusive films can become the norm. He said the film industry has improved at producing more inclusive and diverse films and, most importantly, telling those authentic stories on screen. To him, the most important thing to remember is that audiences need to show their support by coming to the theater. 
“We work hard,” Hornsby said. “You want to be entertained, you want to see something that’s representative of who you are and what your beliefs are, you should take your hard-earned dollar and put it toward whatever movie you want to see at the movie theater, what you want to see on DVD, because commerce drives content. When you come see [a film], that lets everybody know, the people at the studios know, that there is an audience for this.” 
The event as a whole was a celebration of the release of “The Hate U Give” on digital, Blu-Ray and DVD. Hornsby encouraged the audience to support the film, which he believes is a “classic” that will accurately empathize with relevant issues for years to come.

Last Saturday, I found myself back in Leimert Park, this time attending an event at The Metaphor Club.
The club was packed with black people from all different professions mingling, drinking coffee and chatting as they waited for the main event to begin. Attorneys were speaking with film producers, and bankers were hanging out with journalists. I noticed there was a lack of tension in the room, resulting in an ease that I do not often see among black people. There were no eyes glaring when someone reached into their pockets, no verbal code-switching needed for communication and no focus on whether one was being too black or not black enough in the public space. In other words, we felt safe. 
“It was obvious from almost day one when we opened up that there was a desperate need … for a space like this,” said Lawrence Ross, co-owner of The Metaphor Club. “When you get here, you understand the possibilities and what happens when you have an unapologetically black space, what happens when everyone is really encouraging.” 
The Metaphor Club opened last August on Crenshaw Boulevard. It is owned by four men who were members of the same national fraternity in college: Lawrence Ross, Lawrence Gilliam, Jimar Wilson and Gerald Rawles. Most of them grew up in South L.A. and wanted to create a gathering space for people in their community.
“With the change in our neighborhood that we’re witnessing, we wanted to make sure that we could always have a stake in the ground for our culture on Crenshaw,” Gilliam said. “The way we wanted to manifest that was in a creative space — a place where people could … come in and be creative and work and be productive and not be afraid to say what they need to say.”
Now, six months later, the club’s membership has skyrocketed and it is already the largest black-owned coworking space in Los Angeles. There is a monthly fee of $79.99, with a discounted rate for students and teachers. The price is relatively inexpensive compared to other coworking spaces in L.A., where the monthly fee can be anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars. However, at The Metaphor Club, a membership is not even required to attend some events. Several of the events are free, like the one I attended; some have visitors pay at the door and, if someone wishes to spend the day there, they offer day passes. Their quest for inclusivity outweighs their exclusivity in order to create a thriving creative community. 
“A quarter percent of our membership is just independent business professionals,” Rawles said. “People who don’t want to work from home but find themselves not needing a full-blown office.” 
The Metaphor Club hosts many events throughout the month. Every second and fourth Friday, it hosts “Blacademics,” a networking opportunity for college students and faculty. The club also rents out its space next door for art shows and other events and even hosts panel discussions with working professionals from Hollywood.
“[It’s] the energy [and] being around people who look like you,” said Monique Judge, who moderated the event I attended. “When you come here, you are working with other black writers, and we just vibe. The energy helps gets your creativity flowing … [This] is a good place to get work done, and feel like you are a part of a community.” 
Saturday’s event was a panel discussion with a few staff writers and editors from Netflix’s new comedy “Family Reunion,” which is about an African American family attending their family reunion. The show is unique in that all the writers for the show are black, a rare find in Hollywood. The writers said Netflix asked them to create a black-centric family comedy and to not shy away from expressing themselves. 
“Although it’s an all-black show with black writers and black people, it’s still a family [show], and everyone can relate to it,” said Howard Jordan, one of the story editors for the show. 
Jordan also noted that many television shows create black characters for the sole intention of educating non-black audiences and a lot of the black characters today are not even written by black people, giving a lack of authenticity to many of the situations those characters find themselves in. 
“[For us,] it’s organic,” he said. “[They] argue in the writer’s room on what it means to be black but also … have days where they don’t mention blackness. It naturally comes out … [the writers aren’t] forcing it.” 
After the panel, people resumed mingling, this time over chocolate cake. Names and numbers were exchanged as people began to connect and share ideas. The artists spoke with the entrepreneurs and, it turns out, the attorney wanted to become a screenwriter. It felt like the the walls we had spent years building to protect ourselves from society had temporarily come down to let fresh air into our worlds. 
“We are highly encouraging of making you be the best person you can actually [be] while being in this space,” Ross said. “This is a space that is a nurturing space … this is a place where you can learn from other people.” 
The result is a modern-day, black Café Society, where no black person has to adjust their mannerisms to be presentable for white people. Immediately, I understood the importance of The Metaphor Club. In a world where black people are arrested for simply sitting down in a Starbucks, finally, there is a public space made just for us where, for a moment, we can simply exist. 
But then, as quickly as it all began, it ended. And we all had to leave. So, we walked back out onto a quiet Crenshaw Boulevard and put up our walls, at least until the next club encounter.

The Thornton School of Music held its Thornton Edge performance Tuesday in the Newman Concert Hall, featuring conductor Donald Crockett and visiting guest piano duo HOCKET. The evening program included inventive contemporary pieces and unconventional instruments, such as wine glasses, piano strings and melodicas. When combined with classical instruments, they blossomed into a flowing, evocative ensemble.
Crockett, who has directed Thornton Edge since 1984, as a new development in the history of music. For this performance, Crockett and his students began preparation in late January to blend the musicians’ talents and bring energy into the program. 
“There are various basic textures in music … one type of texture we use here is called heterophony, simultaneous unfolding of lines like a web,” Crockett said. “This is our specialty, [performing]  pieces with unusual sounds.”
Ariel Machell, an alumna who graduated in 2018, attended the concert. 
“I always think it’s particularly fascinating to come to things like this because I don’t particularly understand it,” Machell said. “A lot of it happens in the way that communication happens: without words, reacting to feelings and emotions … There’s definitely an artistry involved that to the layman, all you can do is just sit there in awe. ”
Thornton Edge brought life to Andy Akiho’s “Karakurenai,” a piece that features improvisation and distinct sounds from instruments like coat hangers and chopsticks. 
The ensemble also performed selections from “Duplicity,” a soundtrack by James Newton Howard. The piece features string instruments and incorporates subtle pizzicato tones, a trombone switching mutes multiple times and a setup of bronze gongs setting the mood for the concert. 
Piano duo HOCKET performed its original piece “Outsider.” In their performance, the group members  slammed their forearms down on the piano keys.
The night ended with USC alumnus Dan Visconti’s “Low Country Haze” as the finale. The concert’s use of unconventional instruments and modern music techniques created a sense of mysticism and innovation throughout.
“We treat our own instruments as strange instruments,” said Adam Karelin, a freshman trombone player in the ensemble. “We get to know our own classical instruments through different perspectives. It totally overthrows our perceptions of what a classical concert can be … It’s exciting, it’s fresh and it’s relevant. To me, it’s the music of our times.”
Theodore Haber, a sophomore violinist in the ensemble, said Thornton students have no qualms in exploring new methods to create innovative sounds. 
“Everyone is very down to do that,” Haber said. “Nobody is like, ‘A wine glass? I’m not going to touch a wine glass.’ It’s a very open-minded group.”
The next Thornton Edge performance takes place April 9 at Newman Recital Hall and will feature guest pianists HOCKET.
