After four years as head coach of the women’s basketball team, Cynthia Cooper-Dyke resigned on Friday following USC’s loss to Cal in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament. 
“We thank Cynthia for her dedication, hard work and service and we wish her the very best,” Athletic Director Lynn Swann said. “She is a great Trojan and will always be a valued member of the Trojan Family.”
Cooper-Dyke stepped down after four years coaching the women’s basketball team – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
Cooper-Dyke has a lengthy history at USC, starting from her time as a player from 1982-1986. In 1983 and 1984, she helped lead the team to back-to-back NCAA Championship victories, and she finished her career in USC’s history books as ninth all-time in points, eighth in assists and third in steals. Her legacy was recognized in 1999, when she was inducted into USC Athletic Hall of Fame.
With her accomplishments as a Trojan, along with winning an Olympic gold medal and four WNBA championships, Cooper-Dyke came into the USC program as a coach with expectations that she would bring the team back to the status it enjoyed during her playing career. Cooper-Dyke had already coached three other programs (Prairie View A&M, UNC Wilmington and Texas Southern) from subpar records to contention, and she won a conference championship with Prairie View A&M in 2006.
Then-Athletic Director Pat Haden praised Cooper-Dyke when he hired her in April 2013.
“In Cynthia Cooper, we have a proven winning coach who happens to be a USC basketball icon,” Haden said. “She was a part of the best basketball ever played here at USC, and she has seen success at so many levels of the game. As a coach, she has turned around several programs. We believe she can lead USC back to successful women’s basketball, and we welcome her back to the USC campus.”
During Cooper-Dyke’s debut campaign, her team played at a level that had not been seen at USC in quite a few years. The Trojans went from finishing the 2012 season at 11-20 to racing out to a 3-0 start with Cooper-Dyke at the helm, a feat that had not been accomplished since 1998. 
From there, USC defeated its first ranked team since 2011, taking down No. 12 Colorado in January 2014. Cooper-Dyke not only took her team to the Pac-12 Tournament that season but also ran the table, coaching the Trojans to a huge upset victory over Oregon State to clinch the championship trophy and a 22-13 overall record. 
Cooper-Dyke’s first year in charge was both a significant improvement for the program and an unqualified success, but her following years did not live up to that bar. In the 2015 season, USC went 7-11 in conference play; in 2016, it went 6-12; and this season, it finished 5-13. Based off of records, the Trojans have slowly drifted further away from the promising 2014 season. Cooper-Dyke lit a fire under USC early on, but it has since fizzled out.
“I absolutely love USC, and I always want what is best for this university,” Cooper-Dyke said.  “What is best right now is that I step aside as the women’s basketball coach and let someone else lead this team.”
Throughout her final season, Cooper-Dyke also had to deal with a plethora of injuries throughout the year, including losing redshirt senior guard Jordan Adams for the entire season and numerous others for multi-game stretches. However, junior forward Kristen Simon, senior guard Courtney Jaco and freshman guard Minyon Moore all enjoyed standout individual seasons; the team had the talent but was unable to put it all together for a winning season. Cooper-Dyke was initially able to bring life to the team, but the search is now on for someone else to make that same impact on the program for the long haul.
“The USC women’s basketball program has a tradition built on national championships, great players and outstanding coaches,” Swann said. “We look forward to bringing in a coach who will add to that legacy, one who will move our program forward while doing so in one of the world’s greatest cities, at one of the country’s finest academic institutions and in the nation’s premier women’s basketball conference.”
Cooper-Dyke will always be welcomed on campus thanks to her history as both a player and coach, but she relinquished her official role with the University on Friday, opening the door for another Trojan to build a legacy with the women’s basketball team.
“I appreciate the opportunity I was given to coach at my alma mater, a university that has meant so much to me since my days as a student-athlete,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I wish we had more success, but I am thankful for the effort given by the players, coaches and support staff and am fortunate to have worked alongside them.  I also want to thank our fans for their loyal support.
“I will always love USC and will be cheering on the Women of Troy in the future as they accomplish great things.”
 
 
A nice way of escorting her out the door. It was a shame she couldn’t produce to make the program competitive
in the conference and nationally being a true Trojan . Time to finally get a Coach who will recruit well locally, and
get players who can be productive in their roles to fit the team needs.

The women’s basketball team’s season ended on Thursday morning, as they lost 71-58 to Cal in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament at the KeyArena in Seattle. 
Cal forward Kristine Anigwe was the x-factor in a tightly contested game. She scored 34 points with 13 rebounds, dropping 11 points in the final quarter. 
“Just a hard-fought game for 40 minutes,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “Kristine [Anigwe] was tough to stop. I thought Cal made crucial baskets in the important moments of the game, and we couldn’t necessarily get the stops we needed.”
Before Anigwe’s impressive fourth quarter shifted the game’s momentum, USC was neck and neck with Cal. They led by 1 point after the first quarter and trailed 30-28 at halftime.
“We missed some defensive assignments when we were supposed to trap [Anigwe],” Cooper-Dyke said. “Then we allowed her to get too deep in the paint, whereas before we were very physical with her. There were some early fouls called that I thought made us tentative defensively against Kristine. And it was tough to stop her once she got into an offensive rhythm.”
Junior forward Kristen Simon came back strongly after playing only 11 minutes against Arizona due to injury. On Thursday, she played 22 minutes, scoring 17 points on an efficient 8-of-14 shooting. 
While Simon produced a solid outing for her team, the 3-point shooting struggles that plagued the Trojans against Arizona State and Arizona continued. USC shot under 30 percent from long range for the third game in a row, this time going 3-of-14. Over the last three games, senior sharpshooter Courtney Jaco has shot a surprising 4-of-18 from long distance. She is the second all-time 3-point scorer in school history. 
After trading blows in the first half, Cal went on a quick 7-0 run to start the third quarter. The Bears led by as many as nine in the third frame, but a few scores by freshman guard Minyon Moore lessened the deficit. She finished 10 points and 5 rebounds. 
“We knew we had to attack their pressure,” Jaco said. “And once we did that and drew the help, we could pass it easily to the open player, but I think we just didn’t have that mindset for 40 minutes.”
Entering the fourth quarter, the Trojans were down by just 3 points and within striking distance of the second round of the Pac-12 Tournament. However, they ran into a string of dominance by Anigwe and were unable to slow her down. She started off the quarter by scoring her team’s next 9 points, all on jump shots.
By the end of her scoring rampage, the Bears led by five and the Trojans were unable to mount one more comeback with such little time left. 
“I’m very proud of the effort that we gave for 40 minutes,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I want to first thank our seniors. Jaco has done a fantastic job, and really all of our seniors, all year long, all four years.”
For Jaco, the game was her final one on the court in a Trojan uniform. Despite the loss, she was positive in reflecting on her college basketball career.
“When you get out of college basketball, you kind of miss that camaraderie and stuff like that,” Jaco said. “My teammates this year were really special. Some of them, they’ll be long-time friends, so that’s going to mean the most to me.”
This team is lousy.  They have shown no progress for a few years now.  It starts with the head coach.  Cooper-Dyke be gone.
Coach Cooper-Dyke is always full of excuses. Hope this final loss puts an end to her position as leader of this program.
Losing 14 times in the conference with only 5 wins says more than enough about her coaching ability in a big time conference.
The way the team played in the last four minutes plus getting outscored 10 to 1 when down only three is proof enough of her
game management. Maybe she is a decent pro coach like predecessor Michael Cooper, but has pushed this program to the
near bottom of irrelevancy. Being a very good player like Magic Johnson doesn’t translate to being a good coach sometimes.

After picking up a strong home victory over Washington State on Wednesday, USC now looks to host another foe from the north this Saturday as it takes on Washington in its final contest of the regular season.  In order to pick up a win in what will be a crucial game against the Huskies, there are several areas of emphasis in which USC must excel to finish its season on a firm note.
Be Ready For Fultz
It’s no secret to anyone that Washington goes as its superstar freshman guard Markelle Fultz goes. Averaging 23.2 points per game, 5.9 rebounds and 5.7 assists per game this season, Fultz is a finalist for some of the most high-profile college basketball awards — including the John Wooden Award, which honors the top player in the nation. 
However, Fultz is currently listed as questionable for playing in Saturday’s game against the Trojans, as he is recovering from what has been announced as a sore right knee injury. 
When USC and Washington played on Feb. 1, Fultz finished with 20 points (7-for-17 shooting), six assists and five rebounds. 
“He’s a great player, and he’s able to score at all three levels offensively,” said junior guard Jordan McLaughlin, who could be pitted against Fultz in the backcourt Saturday. “He’s also able to get his teammates involved, so we’ve been practicing on keying in defensively.”
Should Fultz take the floor for Washington on Saturday, the Trojans need to be prepared to defend one of the most lethal offensive talents in the nation. 
Establish the defensive pressure
In its 87-64 victory over Washington State on Wednesday, USC was able to record nine steals and collect seven blocks on defense. 
In the first half alone, the Trojans were able to capitalize by scoring 17 points off of 11 Washington State turnovers to open the game. USC’s defensive play opened up large opportunities in transition for easy baskets. 
“When you get nine steals it means you’re getting out in transition a lot, too,” men’s basketball coach Andy Enfield said. “Then in transition we’re making good passes and hitting open shots.”
The Trojans have been scrappy on defense all season long, as they lead the Pac-12 in steals (averaging 6.9 per game). USC has also defended the paint, as it ranks third in the conference in blocked shots per game at 5.5. 
Freshman guard De’Anthony Melton is currently second in the conference in steals with 57 (he trails only UCLA’s Lonzo Ball and Washington’s Matisse Thybulle who have 58). 
The Trojans will need another solid effort defensively in their home arena Saturday to come away with a win over Washington. Not only has the Trojans defensive unit knocked opponents off-rhythm, but they also create opportunities in transition. 
Activate Boatwright
Since returning from an MCL injury on Feb. 1, sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright has averaged 18.3 PPG over the last eight games.
Boatwright’s first game returning from his injury came against the Huskies in Washington on Feb. 1. In his return, Boatwright immediately looked in the swing of things offensively, as he finished with a game-high 23 points. 
A 6-foot-10 forward with the ability to create his own shot in the paint, mid-range or from beyond 3-point range, Boatwright brings a unique dynamic to the Trojan offense. Another strong performance from Boatwright against Washington will be essential, as the Trojans would like to see their primary scorer heat up as the Pac-12 Tournament approaches in the coming week. 
Keep the hot hand
In their last two games against Washington State and Arizona State, USC is shooting a combined 66-for-121 (54.5 percent) from the field. From 3-point range the Trojans shot a combined 22-for-52 (42.3 percent) against the Cougars and Sun Devils. 
“It’s been nice to see our team shooting the ball better over the past couple of games. Even in the loss (to Arizona State) I thought we were shooting well,” Enfield said.
The last time that Washington and USC played, the Trojans finished the game by making 17 of their final 25 shot attempts (68 percent) in regulation. USC will look to replicate this showing on the floor Saturday. 
Play a complete game
This may be the most crucial point of focus for the Trojans, not just on Saturday, but for the remainder of their season. 
USC suffered a dramatic loss on Feb. 26 against Arizona State in which a 10-point lead for the Trojans with 3:57 remaining in play evaporated. The Trojans were unable to execute and play situational basketball and clinch the victory over the Sun Devils. 
The last thing the Trojans can afford to do is give away Saturday’s game in similarly-devastating fashion. Should Washington beat USC due to the Trojans’ inability to finish the game, it will do some serious damage to the Trojans’ Pac-12 and NCAA Tournament hopes going forward. 
“When you have a lead, you have to be able to play for 40 complete minutes,” Enfield said. “(Our players) know what’s at stake. We are playing a two-game season. Washington State was game one, and now we are on to Washington Saturday for game two. Our players need to come out with the same energy they did (on Wednesday).”

Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanHeads up · Junior guard Jordan McLaughlin looks to captain the Trojans to victory against Washington on Saturday to wrap up the regular season.
Two weeks ago, the men’s basketball team may have looked forward to Saturday’s matchup against Washington, hoping to use the game to build momentum heading into the postseason. With the Trojans stumbling to the finish line, however, their date with the Huskies is no longer an opportunity, but a mandatory assignment.
Once a foregone conclusion, USC’s spot in the NCAA tournament is now in jeopardy. ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi released his latest projections on Thursday, listing the Trojans as one of the last four teams into March Madness. The tipping point came last weekend, when USC squandered a double-digit lead to lose at Arizona State. The Trojans may need the victory over Washington — possibly more at the Pac-12 tournament next week — to secure a berth in the Big Dance.
Shelby Mast, who runs the website Bracket W.A.G. and works as USA Today’s bracketologist, weighed in on the Trojans postseason prospects.
“[The loss] affected them quite a bit,” she said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. “They better not lose [to the Huskies].”
Missing out on March Madness would spell disaster for head coach Andy Enfield and his squad. The program has made impressive strides since his arrival in 2013, making it into the tourney for the first time in his tenure last year. USC came into this season hoping to build on its first-round exit versus Providence in 2016, but it may not get the opportunity to do so if it fails to execute against Washington.
But amid the noise surrounding the team’s postseason prospects, the Trojans are keeping their heads down.
“We’ve all been playing basketball for a little while. We know the ins and outs, the politics behind everything,” junior guard Elijah Stewart told the Los Angeles Times. “We just know if you have a certain amount of wins, you don’t have to be concerned about the bubble. If we keep going and make strong strides in the Pac-12 tournament, I feel like we should be fine.”
USC may have caught a break, too, as the Huskies’ projected first-round NBA draft pick, freshman guard Markelle Fultz, is expected to miss Saturday’s game with a knee injury. Fultz led his team with 20 points and six assists against the Trojans when they visited Seattle last month, and Washington (2-15 in Pac-12 play) faces a tall challenge without its star. The team is already in the midst of an ugly 11-game losing streak, which USC will look to extend this weekend.
With the Trojans on the bubble for the NCAA tournament (and unlikely to earn an automatic bid by winning the Pac-12 championship), their postseason fate will ultimately be determined by the selection committee, and Enfield appealed to USC’s strength of schedule heading into the regular season’s final weekend.
“That decision is not up to us or me,” Enfield said. “I really have no idea. I think a lot depends on teams around the country. We have a good RPI: UCLA’s ranked third [in the AP top 25], and we beat them. SMU’s ranked 14th, and we beat them. So we have some really good wins.”
A strong victory over Washington would further strengthen the Trojans’ resume — and Enfield hopes his team can also add a few more wins next week in Las Vegas.
What are you talkin’ about Ollie? Agree If the Trojans would lose at home to UW playing w/o their star player USC doesn’t deserve an invite. Come on now, beating a better WSU team by 23 the other night think the Trojans could lose legit to this bottom feeder. Other forecasters have the Trojans anywhere from 7 to 9 seed so your article has no merit, and is just filling space.

The Trojans (6-2) get the Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic underway on Friday against San Diego (4-2) at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field. 
Historically the Trojans have had few problems against the Toreros, boasting a 20-4 record in past outings with the latest being a 3-2 Trojans win in 2008. 
Junior ace Mitch Hart will most likely take the mound Friday night, with junior pitcher Brad Wegman and sophomore pitcher Marrick Crouse to follow in the games against Michigan (6-2) on Saturday night and UCLA (4-3) on Sunday afternoon. 
“On the mound, whether it’s Mitch Hart or Brad Wegman or Marrick Crouse, we’re going to need those guys to really step up and be significant weekend starters in our league,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. 
The College Baseball Classic has been around since 2010 and has always involved the two hometown teams, USC and UCLA, as hosts. However, the other two teams featured in the tournament have been a revolving door of talent from across the country. 
This year the classic will feature Michigan and San Diego, while past classics have featured reputable teams such as Vanderbilt and TCU.
Michigan and San Diego are making their first appearances in the classic and will play the first game of the doubleheader at Dodger Stadium on Sunday morning after playing each of the other teams throughout the weekend. 
Historically, UCLA has had the upper hand, winning four of the six matchups. Last year, UCLA pulled out a victory in a 14-inning 5-3 win. 
Despite UCLA initially being ranked ahead of USC in preseason standings, the Trojans sit at No. 3 in the Pac-12, and UCLA stands at No. 8. USC is also currently ahead in team batting average (.293 to .250) and team fielding (.986 to .980). 
“The UCLA series is always fun since they’re our hometown rival,” senior outfielder Corey Dempster said on the two teams’ first matchup of the season. 
The Trojans are coming off a 2-0 win against Duke in North Carolina with a career-best performance from junior pitcher Mason Perryman. They have had a few days to recover from the cross-country road trip. 
Players to look out for are Dempster, redshirt junior Frankie Rios and sophomore slugger Lars Nootbaar. Nootbaar follows with an average of .462 in 26 at bats with a Pac-12-leading four home runs. 
He is also tied for second with 12 RBIs. In addition, freshman infielder John Thomas is No. 6 in Pac-12 batting average (minimum three plate appearances) with an average of .500.
Dempster recently returned to the starting lineup with a bang. He hit two home runs over the road trip to North Carolina. 
“Dempster had a really good year for us last year in the outfield and hit .290,” Hubbs said. “He is returning as one of our top home-run hitters.”
The Trojans have been wielding a hot bat and should have few issues with run production this weekend. USC will have to rely on its pitching to hold down the offenses of San Diego, Michigan and UCLA if it wants to find success this weekend.

Last year marked a season of firsts for the beach volleyball team. Not only did the Trojans capture the historic first-ever NCAA national championship and the inaugural Pac-12 Championship last May, but they also ended the season on a school-record 30-match winning streak, becoming the first program to ever win back-to-back national titles.
So while 2016 was all about making history, the 2017 season is an opportunity for USC to add onto its dynasty and cement itself as the premier beach volleyball program in the nation.
The preseason No. 1 Trojans are led by head coach Anna Collier, who enters her sixth season at the helm with a 108-17 overall record and a .864 winning percentage. After guiding her team to an undefeated 2015 season and the AVCA National Championship, Collier became the first head coach to reach the 100-win plateau after USC tacked on a program-best 34 wins in 2016. This season, she returns eight of her ten starters from last year, including five seniors, and is in prime position to make another big run in the postseason.
“What we’re trying to do this year is play really good, high quality, elite level volleyball,” Collier said. “We have a lot of good players coming back this season and I think we’re in a good spot, so if we can play the best volleyball we possibly can, then the byproduct will be another Pac-12 Championship and then another NCAA championship.”
Headlining the group of returnees is the pair of senior All-Americans Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes. The duo posted a perfect 48-0 record in 2016 and dropped just one set on the year, extending their remarkable winning streak to 73 matches in a row dating back to the 2015 season. Claes and Hughes, who were named the first-ever Pac-12 Pair of the Year last season, are the winningest pair in program history with a 92-3 combined record.
A new pair will make its debut at Court 2 this season as seniors Sophie Bukovec and Allie Wheeler team up together for the first time in their respective careers. Bukovec, an AVCA All-American and member of the Pac-12 All-Conference First Team, has played at the No. 2 position since she came to USC in 2015, but is now joined by the veteran Wheeler, who makes the jump up one flight from the
No. 3 spot.
Wheeler had played the last three seasons with fellow senior Nicolette Martin and compiled a 91-14 overall record, good for second most wins by a pair all-time in school history. Martin, however, will now join forces with junior Terese Cannon at the three spot. Cannon was used primarily as a reserve in 2016 but has come on strong during the offseason and earned her way to a top three position. Martin, a Pac-12
All-Academic First Team selection a year ago, will serve as a team captain in her final season at USC.
Coming in at the No. 4 position is a pair of young guns in sophomore Abril Bustamante and freshman Joy Dennis. Bustamante was a Pac-12 All-Freshman Team and All-Conference Second Team honoree a year ago and produced a 28-7 overall record. This season, however, she will pair with Dennis, a promising freshman who has significant international experience at the youth level.
Rounding out the fifth and final pair will be juniors Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer. Belton was named to the Pac-12
All-Academic Second Team last year and has been a serviceable option at USC’s lower flights since she arrived at USC. Playing behind Belton will be Kremer, who had an outstanding 2016 season at the five spot. Kremer went 32-6 overall and was named to the NCAA All-Tournament team, finishing the year on a 16-match winning streak.
The Trojans will be tested right out of the gates to open up their season this Saturday in Malibu, as they are scheduled to take on No. 3 UCLA and
No. 4 Pepperdine at Zuma Beach for the Pepperdine Kick-Off. USC has never lost to the Bruins, leading the all-time series 5-0, while the Trojans have also won their last three meetings against the Waves. In addition, USC has won 62 of its last 64 matches dating back to the beginning of 2015. 
“It will be great to see where we stack up because we’ve been training for so long, but only playing against each other,” Collier said. “I think we’re the best in the country, but that doesn’t mean anything, so I’m really excited to see how we match up. We’re looking to be challenged this weekend.”
Claes, the reigning Pac-12 Player of the Year, is also eager to get dual match play started and wants to see just how far along USC is to begin the season. 
“I can’t wait,” Claes said. “We’re obviously hoping for wins across the board, but because it’s our first tournament, we hope that if we do have any hiccups or kinks to work out, we see them early and take care of them so we don’t have any of those problems in the future. I know everybody is going to go out there and play their best this weekend, so I’m really excited to compete with these girls.”
USC will begin their title defense against UCLA on Saturday morning at 11:15 a.m., followed directly after by a 12:30 p.m. matchup against Pepperdine. Both dual matches will be streamed live on FloVolleyball.com.

After 30 games over four months, men’s basketball kisses goodnight to the regular season tomorrow afternoon at the Galen Center when they face the Washington Huskies (9-20, 2-15). The game is vital for the Trojans and inconsequential for the down-and-out Huskies. USC (22-8, 9-8) must win to finish above .500 in conference play for the first time in head coach Enfield’s four seasons. A loss puts their chances of postseason play at risk.
For Washington, a win or loss only matters with regard to star freshman guard Markelle Fultz. Fultz is projected by most to become the first pick in June’s NBA Draft despite playing for one of the worst teams in the Pac-12. He leads the conference in scoring with 23.2 points per game. He  also averages 5.9 assists and 5.7 rebounds per game. But Fultz is currently nursing a knee injury and might not even suit up on Saturday.
If he does, USC will aim to stop Fultz with their freshman standout, De’Anthony Melton. Other than Fultz, Melton is the only Pac-12 freshman to rank among the top-five Pac-12 freshmen in rebounding (fifth), steals (second), blocks (fourth) and assists (fifth).
Melton is not fazed by praiseworthy headlines swirling around the basketball world about Fultz and other freshman prodigies like Lonzo Ball.
“I just try to focus on myself and make sure I’m getting better mentally and physically,” Melton said. “By focusing on myself, I can lock-in [during games].”
Enfield had high praise for Melton. 
“He’s the best guard-rebounder on our team and leads in steals,” Enfield said. “We need his secondary ball-handling on the court.”
Melton kept his starting job through USC’s winless streak, but junior Elijah Stewart came off the bench on Wednesday night for the first time since his sophomore season. 
“Our rotation changed when Bennie came back,” Stewart said on Tuesday. “People who were playing a lot are starting to have to share minutes with another person. Any basketball player is a competitor, but we’re all friends with the same goals.”
It is uncertain whether redshirt sophomore Shaqquan Aaron will continue to start in Steweart’s place on Saturday. Enfield’s altered tactic worked effectively against Washington State, as the Trojans jumped out to an early and insurmountable lead. Aaron played 26 minutes and scored 8 points. Stewart played a season-low 17 and scored six. Both will have to contribute for USC to make a run in March.
So will  McLaughlin, who enjoyed a career-best game against Washington State: The junior guard had a
game-high 17 points and 10 assists, finishing one rebound shy of the second triple-double in program history. He will look to stay hot against Washington.
Oddly, while this game marks the end of the regular season, it could kick off a double-header between the two teams. With a win, USC will finish either fifth or sixth in the Pac-12 (depending on Utah and Cal’s results this weekend), and with a loss, Washington will be 11th, meaning the Trojans and Huskies could face off again soon, in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament next Wednesday.
“[The game] should be fun,” McLaughlin said. “We’re going to go out and compete, hopefully like we did [Wednesday night] against Washington State. It was one of our better games this year, all around. Hopefully we’ll do the same again.”

It’s funny how sports can sometimes work as a metaphor for life — in that everything seems to balance out. For the USC men’s basketball team, it’s the fact that they are neither as good as their 14-0 start nor as bad as their recent losses against three top-ranked teams followed by a debacle at Arizona State.
If those stretches of games were on polar ends of the spectrum, then Wednesday night’s 87-64 home shellacking of Washington State brought it all back down to earth. The Trojans, a team with a fair amount of talent and home-court advantage, played an opponent they should beat  — and they took care of business.
USC won’t sport a national championship contender anytime soon, but convincing wins such as this one indicate a leap out of the
bottom-dweller status the Trojans were relegated to a few years ago and a sign of what head coach Andy Enfield has accomplished thus far. This is where the team is at right now: in the middle of the pack of a conference that has teams placed all over the spectrum — college basketball purgatory, if you will.
Whether by design or just the way it worked out, Enfield’s slow-but-sure progression of the program could test the patience of a fan base that needs a lot more incentive than it’s getting now to fill the Galen Center seats on a regular basis. And following up on its most impressive season in years by winning just one more conference game (if they take care of Washington on Saturday) is by no means a negative, but it is an indication that the program has some work to do before it can compete nationally.
Nevertheless, as the Trojans look to lock up a spot in March Madness with a win over Washington and a decent showing in the Pac-12 Tournament next week, they’ll try to recapture the magic from their 14-0 start and shake off whatever demons may remain from the brutal stretch of four straight losses.
The 14-0 start — USC’s best since 1971 – is one that should be taken with a grain of salt, considering the lack of competitive opponents save for SMU and perhaps Texas A&M and BYU. It’s why the Trojans were able to remain on the select list of undefeated teams in the NCAA until the day before New Year’s Eve, and it’s why they floated around the AP Top 25 poll for a few weeks.
It’s Pac-12 play that has given us a real chance to watch how this program is developing, and it’s clear this team is not quite there yet. Their lone “unexpected” conference win came against UCLA on Jan. 25 at the Galen Center, a game that showed flashes of just how good USC can be.
Problem is, they have to do more than just beat UCLA. They have to take down other top-tier team such as Oregon and Arizona, both of whom beat USC twice this season. They can’t afford to drop winnable games such as Jan. 8 against Cal and last Sunday against ASU, games in which they had a late lead but wound up losing by one in each case. And even on the heels of their statement win over the Bruins in January, it was a considerable letdown for the Trojans to be run off the court in Pauley Pavilion on Feb. 18, giving up 102 points to UCLA in a 32-point beatdown.
That is what has made this season a tad frustrating; just when you think they have something special brewing by blowing through non-conference play and overcoming a 3-4 start in Pac-12 action by reeling off five straight wins, they hit a roadblock against three of the top teams in the country and then falter incredulously against ASU.
It’s the basketball version of the law of averages. And, like last season, they’ll head into Selection Sunday with a bit of uncertainty as to whether they’ll be going dancing later this month — ESPN’s Joe Lunardi has the Trojans as one of the last four teams in, needing to win a play-in game just to make the Round of 64. A quick and sound win over the lowly Huskies on Saturday should improve their chances. So will a strong showing in the Pac-12 Tournament next week, though if they don’t get far, they only have themselves to blame for throwing away the game against ASU that cost them a better seeding.
Roughly a year ago — as the team was in the midst of a season exceeding expectations — I interviewed Enfield for a feature, where he stressed to me not to mention that the team had “arrived” or “accomplished something” despite how well things were going. A year later, it’s safe to say there’s still work to be done before this team can sit at the same table with the big shots.

Photo courtesy of Justine KimRead my lips · Sophomore Justine Kim was originally wary of protests, but was inspired by the crowds she saw the Women’s March.
Like many women across Los Angeles, Justine Kim took a stand during the Women’s March on Jan. 21. Kim, a sophomore majoring in business administration and French, also brought Mogul, a platform for women worldwide to voice their opinions, to USC. To continue the momentum from the Women’s March, Kim introduced the #ReadMyLips campaign to USC in support of women’s rights and health issues. 
“[Mogul is] just a safe space to empower women, to share stories, acquire knowledge and ask questions,” Kim said. “Juli Hurme, director of operations and growth at Mogul, asked me if I wanted to be a part of their college initiative and they wanted to start one at USC. I said “Yes,” as I was really interested, and that’s how I started getting involved with it.”
#ReadMyLips was launched on Feb. 21 and initiated at over 24 schools across the United States, including USC. The campaign got its name from the phrase, “Read my lips: no new taxes,” used by the then-Republican presidential candidate George H. W. Bush at the 1988 Republican National Convention. Kim said the campaign allows people to address President Donald Trump directly by writing messages to him about the protection of women’s rights.
Kim said that before she decided to participate in the Women’s March, she viewed protests negatively. According to Kim, taking part in protests was out of her comfort zone. But when Kim’s roommate told her she was attending the Women’s March, Kim decided to join.
“Just being there in that crowd and seeing how many people were willing to come out and the diversity of people like fathers with their daughters, moms and their daughters and elderly women was amazing to see,” Kim said.
Arianna Wood, a sophomore majoring in business administration and French, overheard Kim speaking with one of her professors about Mogul’s campaign. As a woman in business, Wood was always interested in the perception of others like her, and decided to join Kim. 
“What inspired me to be a part of Mogul’s team here at USC was seeing the recent unrest regarding the presidency, seeing how a lot of women are feeling marginalized and unsafe within their communities,” Wood said.
Natasha Piñon, a sophomore majoring in communication and political science and another member of Kim’s team, said that this campaign is an innovative platform to make women’s voices heard.
“Because I knew there would be a lot of people posting about health-related issues, and I am half Latina, my message had to do more with intersectionality and growing up in Los Angeles,” Piñon said. “We are near the border, so [my message] touched more on that than anything unique to women’s health.”
Kim and her team have reached out to different clubs at USC such as Women SPEAK and Women and Youth Supporting Each Other regarding a collaboration.
The campaign has started to garner interest among students. Nitya Pydipati, a graduate student studying in data informatics, read about the campaign online and expressed her support for women’s rights.
“When I came across the #ReadMyLips campaign, I thought to myself that [this] was a great way for us to send our message across to President Trump about the rights that women deserve,” Pydipati said. “It is extremely important for women to have access to the right healthcare, and it is time that we all come together through such movements and make our voices heard loud and clear.”
To generate interest in the campaign, Kim has designed postcards and letter templates that people can print out and take pictures with, which can then be uploaded on Mogul’s website, along with #ReadMyLips. According to Kim, those who are not comfortable with writing letters to Trump take a picture with a sign that demonstrates their support for women’s sexual health and then share it on social media. 
“It’s a really important time for you to be using your voice, and there is this platform for you to post on,” Kim said. “There isn’t often the opportunity to do that. So I think it’s a really rare opportunity that we should take a hold of no matter what you think your political views are.”
All messages that will be posted on Mogul’s website will be printed out and placed in a floral sculpture. This sculpture will then be delivered to Trump at the White House in Washington, D.C. on April 5.
Please tell me at least 2 “rights” women are missing and demand.

USC alumnus and actor Will Ferrell will deliver the commencement speech on May 12, according to a press release from the University published on Thursday.
Ferrell, who graduated in 1990 from the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism with a degree in sports information, has forged a career in comedy, for which he has accepted numerous awards and accolades. 
After graduating from USC, Ferrell established his comedy beginnings by joining the Groundlings, an improvisational and sketch comedy troupe based in Los Angeles. His work with the Groundlings was noticed by a producer for Saturday Night Live, NBC’s late-night sketch comedy show. Ferrell would go on to lead the cast for seven seasons of the show. In 2001, Ferrell was nominated for an Emmy award for his work on SNL, where he first introduced his impression of George W. Bush. Capitalizing on the character’s popularity, Ferrell wrote and starred in a Broadway play titled You’re Welcome America: A Final Night with George W. Bush, for which he was nominated for a Tony award in 2009. 
Ferrell has also written and starred in multiple comedy movies such as Zoolander, The Other Guys, Elf, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Step Brothers. For his performances in The Producers and Stranger than Fiction, Ferrell received Golden Globe nominations in 2006 and 2007, respectively. 
In 2007, Ferrell, along with co-founder Adam McKay, founded comedy production company Funny or Die, which hosts exclusive material from a regular staff of writers, producers and directors and occasionally features celebrity contributors such as Judd Apatow and James Franco. The production company also supports TV shows such as Zach Galifianakis’ Emmy award-winning web series Between Two Ferns. 
Ferrell received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2011 for his contributions to American humor and was named GQ’s 2015 Comedian of the Year. In addition, Ferrell has made a name for himself with his philanthropy work, providing significant support to Cancer for College, an organization that awards college scholarships to cancer survivors. 
Since his time at the University, Ferrell remains involved with USC. He is an active alumnus of  the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. He has appeared as a guest drum major for the Trojan Marching Band and hosted the School of Cinematic Arts’ 75th Anniversary Gala. 
Is that the best USC can get for Commencement?  A comedian?  Yes, he’s great for stand up and prank tricks with the football team, but for Commencement USC should have a speaker that has a motivational effective speech; someone who has made a mark on the world, the community, the country in a positive manner, AND NOT A POLITICIAN.  Commencement should not be used as political rally, but to provide insight and wisdom to the departing college graduates as they leave their safe zones of the university, mommy, and actually will have to fend for themselves in the real world of life, jobs, their own families and relationships.  There are plenty of USC alumni who have done this…. but a comedian?  What does that say about the state of affairs for this graduating class?

A new hospital is coming to the Health Sciences Campus over the next few years, which the University hopes will expand medical care at the Keck School of Medicine.
President C. L. Max Nikias announced the construction of the hospital at his State of the University address on Feb. 14. According to Keck Dean Rohit Varma, the announcement could not have come at a more appropriate time.
“Our current hospital and facilities are very old,” Varma said. “We spend a fair amount of money fixing the infrastructure of the current hospital — tens of millions of dollars. The needs of the hospital have grown to the point where we need much more modernized space and equipment to provide care.”
Keck maintains three facilities: the Keck Hospital of USC, the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital and the USC Verdugo Hills Hospital. The largest one, Keck Hospital, opened in 1991 and serves as a research and teaching hospital with 401 licensed beds. Seven of the hospital’s medical specialties have earned a top 50 national ranking from U.S. News and World Report.
Varma is confident that the new hospital will also contribute specialized and complex services.
“This new building will primarily be for providing high-end, in-patient care,” Varma said. “This includes cancer care, care for patients with heart disease and stroke [and] patients who have undergone transplants.”
Thomas Jackiewicz, the CEO and senior vice president of Keck Medicine of USC, is optimistic that the new hospital will implement emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and nanotechnology. He envisions a hospital that will incorporate these technologies in treatments while making patients feel comfortable and at home.   
“The challenge is making sure we plan this hospital for the future,” Jackiewicz said. “[That means] taking in new technologies and really thinking about the totality of the experience of the patient coming in.”
Jackiewicz also believes that the hospital can increase access to health care for low-income groups who live near USC. One of his priorities is to ensure that Keck benefits the local community.
“Today, 20 percent of Keck patients are on the Medi-Cal program,” Jackiewicz said. “It’s not about insurance — it’s about being a resource and being committed to the community.”
However, construction on the hospital will likely not begin until 2020. According to the California Health Care Foundation, organizations must first go through a planning phase, including a needs assessment, blueprint and budget for the hospital. Then, the project will undergo a design phase, in which the organization will finalize designs and submit drawings and specifications for official approval and a building permit. Once the project has been approved by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development and the permit has been granted, bidding for the construction contract can start.
“Our first steps are to get a good idea of the site location, services that we want to give, modeling the impact [of the hospital] and looking at the projected demographic changes in Los Angeles,” Jackiewicz said. “We want to be a hospital that focuses on Los Angeles and the Southwest: We want to meet the needs of our community.”
Some aspiring doctors are excited about the learning opportunities a new hospital will bring. One such individual is Scott Valena, a sophomore majoring in human biology who is interested in applying to the Keck School of Medicine.
“I think that it’s very noteworthy that USC is continuing to improve the future of healthcare with the development of this new hospital,” Valena said. “With so many advances in medical and surgical techniques, it’s important to have facilities that are capable of providing the highest level of care for high priority patients.”
I’m excited about the continued growth of my alma mater, including great strides in medicine at our Health Sciences campus… But i’d really like to see USC expand it’s presence across the City.  I wish USC would consider building this new hospital elsewhere… perhaps somewhere mid-city, or the San Fernando Valley… or even the Westside.  I know this would require a potentially difficult search for land, but any of these locations would allow the University to serve communities that otherwise find their medical care at competing hospitals (including, sigh, UCLA).
