Non-fungible tokens have taken the world by storm in recent years, and Blake Asherian, a senior majoring in business administration, noticed. These NFTs are digital assets, such as artwork, that have become collectibles.
Asherian observed the most popular and sought after NFTs came with “crazy price tags.” After an expensive NFT caught his eye, he asked 10 of his roommates to split the cost. This birthed the idea for Moonlight, a platform aiming to be “the world’s simplest Fractional NFT marketplace.”
“Everyone just put their money together within 30 seconds,” Asherian said. “It’s pretty lucrative, the idea of splitting the cost of something to collectively purchase it.”
Using a GoFundMe-type model, Moonlight allows users to fundraise to purchase expensive NFTs. Those who donate become co-owners, each of whom own a part of the NFT equivalent to the portion of the total cost that they purchased.
“It’s really cool because people want to feel like they’re owning the cool stuff, but they’re not able to sometimes with the price barriers,” Asherian said. “We developed a crowdfunding technology to allow people to essentially crowdfund everything.”
Beyond crowdfunding, users will be able to sell shares of an NFT whenever they want to. In fact, the technology Moonlight has developed allows owners to give up ownership instantaneously. In all, users will be able to crowdfund, collect, trade and sell NFTs.
Moonlight’s website outlines the project’s mission of lowering the barriers of entry into the world of digital currency: “The digital future is reconstructing culture by putting the power in the hands of the many, not the few,” a blurb reads.
Moonlight’s current development is in website form. As the team is in its early startup stages, this is a way to “test the concept,” Asherian said, and once the idea gains traction, the project will transition into an app. 
Moonlight was created and marketed by Asherian, Gabriel Perez, Matt Hausman and Can Toraman, who all met through mutual friends. Perez, a junior majoring in economics, leads the team’s social media, publicity and outreach. Hausman, an alumnus who studied computer science, was tasked with building the website and Toraman, a senior majoring in computer science, is a technical advisor. 
“The four of us on the team have a really solid understanding of how blockchain technology works behind the scenes and what it can be used for in the future. I think that creates great communication opportunities between the four of us,” Perez said.
In the development phase, Asherian was influenced by his work with his cousin Sean Rad, a co-founder of dating app Tinder. Rad was also an angel investor in Web3 companies at the time, so while Asherian was working with Rad he became seriously interested in NFTs. 
“Sean was all about building very simple products that everyone would want to use, which is a huge inspiration to what I started doing,” Asherian said.
Both Asherian and Perez said it took a significant amount of time practicing and learning about the complex world of buying and selling NFTs to develop Moonlight. Their target audience is those who are interested in the space but lack the funds to get deeply involved.
“We’re delivering a product to NFT-passionate people who feel like they’re very early to the space but somehow can’t afford anything,” Perez said.
Beyond helping people raise funds, Moonlight hopes to increase the simplicity of the process for those who don’t understand how to buy and sell NFTs on their own.
“I didn’t really know what I was doing in the beginning when I got into NFTs, and I just wished there was a site like this where I was able to get the coolest stuff in a simple way,” Asherian said.
Moonlight also has a special feature called “liquidity providing,” through which people can lock their ownership in a certain token. By signing a pledge that they won’t sell their shares in an NFT, they earn a percentage of the trading fee that Moonlight collects. 
“We’re once again hitting the audience of people that would want to hold and then also hitting the audience of people that would want to sell immediately and liquidate their position,” Asherian said. 
The website is currently finishing its final phase of development to ensure security before entering beta, a testing phase to check for errors. Once it’s ready, the team plans to do a soft launch and get the first NFT crowdfunded successfully. 
While Moonlight is only going to be used for crowdfunding NFTs at its start, the team hopes the platform will be a place to crowdfund for everything involving cryptocurrency. 
“We see this as bigger than just NFTs; we see this as just allowing people to come together for a greater good,” Asherian said. “We’re targeting a very small audience, which is just the NFT audience. And once we have a proof of concept and we’re able to scale, we’re gonna be hitting each industry one by one.”

During a workshop led by USC student organization Architecture + Advocacy, high school students participated in an exercise to design spaces for their communities. Some thought up designs for soup kitchens and gardens — large structures that add value to the places where they live. A+A programming director and co-founder Lauren Jian was particularly struck by one student’s chief focus on designing an accessible public bathroom, which Jian said encompassed the organization’s vision: empowering students to create equitable communities and advocate for themselves.
Architecture + Advocacy provides cost-free design workshops for K-12 students aimed to encourage them to enter the architecture field and address design inequities in their local communities — to confront spatial injustice. 
Co-founder Erin Light said spatial injustice involves looking at how architects have designed and created inequitable spaces. Issues such as food deserts and unequal school funding are the result of inequitable design, she said, which is why the zip code into which someone is born heavily shapes their access to opportunity and social mobility. 
“We really want to empower people to take back a seat at the design table because for so long, excluding diverse voices from the position of architect has been used to disempower BIPOC and women and immigrant and LGBTQ — so many oppressed communities — and we really want to empower people with the design skills to change that,” Light, a fourth year architecture student, said.
The organization was initially started as part of the Comprehensive Diversity Initiative, a coalition of student leaders from the School of Architecture created in the aftermath of the 2020 protests against police brutality and racism. The coalition, which began as a discussion about actively combatting racism and discrimination against Black students, later submitted a statement to the school’s administration outlining demands and solutions to fostering diversity in the school. 
A survey administered through the CDI showed architecture students wanted to feel more connected to the surrounding community and felt the school needed to take a more active role in addressing issues of gentrification and food insecurity, among others. A+A was founded in Spring 2021 to fill this desire and as a way to bring architectural resources to South Los Angeles.
Architecture workshops for high school students who want to study the field in college can be expensive and therefore inaccessible, said Jian, a fourth year architecture student. The organization’s high school-specific workshops range from one day to over one month, depending on the age group, and aim to introduce students to architecture concepts and let them take part in projects that address inequity in South L.A. 
“I was very lucky in high school. I got scholarships in order to learn and then when I got to college, I wanted to make sure that other students like me would have access to this form of education,” Jian said. 
The team is in the process of developing a five-week course that merges technical knowledge and real-world application through design-build. A+A is working with an exclusive partner on the course, coined “Build the Block,” which will aim to involve grass-roots community partners to create a tangible design outcome. 
A+A typically partners with after-school programs — sometimes directly through schools and sometimes through other nonprofit programs. The organization has previously partnered with L.A. Commons, which develops community-based arts programming to engage cultural expression, and several L.A. Unified School District programs, including the GIFTED Network for African American Students and Families. 
The organization brings in guest lecturers for students to present to — preparing them for critiques similar to what they would have to face in a post-secondary architecture program and encouraging them to develop their presentation skills.  
“Architecture is so many things that make us feel powerful. Architecture is collaborative, reflective, narrative building, community building and a process for change, and we are at the forefront for that process to change,” said Cassius Palacio, a co-founder and second year architecture student.
The team hopes to expand its online curriculum and create more accessible material for people who may not be able to attend a workshop in person, and add fall programming. The organization also has a base in New York and looks to eventually expand to other cities on the East Coast.  
In addition to the technical architecture skills that students learn through the program, Palacio said, participants come away with soft skills such as social and emotional learning, sustainability, community empowerment and civic engagement. 
“We even had another 11th grader say that learning about architecture made me change my whole mentality,”  Palacio said. “I realized we could make not only South L.A. better, but also the whole world.”

Remnants of Amy Winehouse, Lana Del Rey and any other absolute killer vocalist can be heard through Lily Forte’s powerful voice that immediately fills any room in which she performs.
The singer, a senior majoring in music industry, released her second single of the year, “One Ways,” Aug. 25. It is simultaneously gritty yet feminine, like most of her discography. It reeks of unrequited love and beautifully captures the self-inflicted pain from leading with your heart — a brave feat that Forte has seemingly mastered.
“In this song, I talk about the sort of obsession that you can have with someone and it goes so far and you really can’t control your thoughts at some points,” Forte said. “I feel like I say things that people might be like, ‘Oh that’s so crazy.’ We might have not all thought the same thing, but the feeling is there when you’re really obsessed with someone.”
One of the opening lines, “I take my time learning about what you like hoping that I could be that too,” effortlessly encapsulates that exact feeling. 
A south Florida native, Forte transferred to USC as a junior and made the trek out to California for the first time in 2021. She has since developed her artistry and grown a devoted fan base that eagerly awaits each of her coming releases and, according to Forte, the move “whipped [her] into shape.”
“Everyone’s out here following their pursuit, so it kind of just forces you to really look inward for what you want to do,” she said. “I feel like I had to become fearless in a sense and just not care what anyone thought about me because everyone’s trying to do this thing and if I really want to get there, I got to focus in on it.”
However, those who have worked alongside Forte — who was once described as a “glitzy bar singer” by a friend — know that her noticeable drive is not something new. 
Dylan Thomas, who has produced all of Forte’s releases thus far, became friends with the singer through the School of Rock program in Florida before reconnecting after high school and beginning their collaborations. 
“She does it all. I feel like every single stream she’s gotten on those songs she’s earned,” Thomas said. “I know what she was like in Florida where she would spend like five or six hours a day just pushing her music constantly.”
Frequent songwriting collaborator Jamie Gelman also echoed similar sentiments about Forte’s self-discipline and ability.
“She lives and breathes her craft and her music and is constantly seeking to improve it and to discover more about herself and her artistry,” said Gelman, a senior majoring in music industry. “I find it so impressive and inspiring for me. I love feeding off of her confidence in herself and in her music.”
Gelman, who became friends with the singer after meeting in a “class about rocks,” said co-writing songs with the singer has allowed for space to process the flurry of feelings we all have.
“As a songwriter, it really is more so being the conduit for the artist or helping them translate thoughts or what’s going on in their head,” Gelman said. “You [want to] make something that’s super relatable that can also make people want to just tap their feet or dance, or get up and feel something.”
As a self-proclaimed romantic, Forte is game for wearing her heart on her sleeve and leaving everything on the floor. 
“Being an artist, you just kind of have to be okay with everyone knowing your secrets. It is what it is,” Forte said.
Though her discography only consists of nine songs now, Forte feels that her growth and undoubtable upward trajectory is noticeable.
“With my EP ‘Losing the Illusion,’ I still hold it very close to my heart, but now looking back, I think I was playing it safe a bit,” Forte said. “Since then, I kind of grew into my voice a little bit more. I think I’m just more confident now and I think I’ve established who I am more.”
As a producer, Thomas works to build a song from chords and a melody to a holistic, sophisticated arrangement, and said that Forte’s self-awareness has made for extremely productive sessions.
“It’s fun working with her because she’s open-minded, and she knows what she likes and she knows what she wants, but she also lets me do my thing as well,” Thomas said.
Without the backing of a label and distribution or publishing deal, Forte proves that if you got it, you got it. Her work and following speak for themselves.
“I know that at this stage, no one’s going to work as hard as I am going to work on this stuff so I’ve been having to stay strong in my mindset and goals,” Forte said. “Finding people and seeking out collaborations with people that believe in me and believe in the art has been really important and I found that.”

Four Pockets are, indeed, Full in “Untrapped: The Story of Lil Baby,” (2022) the new Amazon Prime Video documentary on Dominique Armani Jones, better known by his titular stage name.
The film, which premiered for streaming today after screening at Tribeca Film Festival in June, relays a brilliantly-crafted story of an artist who overcame doubt, oppression, poverty and racism to escape the “Trap” — an all-too-common suffocation by systemic and institutional racism in his home city of Atlanta.
On Wednesday night, Amazon held an early screening of the recut documentary in Los Angeles. The Cinemark of Baldwin Hills in Crenshaw lit up with lights and signs eager to persuade people to see the trials and tribulations that Jones  overcame to reach superstardom.
The decision to host a screening in L.A. followed a trend seen across the nation, as filmmakers and Amazon’s engagement directors sought to connect people of color in historically oppressive urban centers such as Houston, Philadelphia and Chicago with Jones’ story. As the Michigan Chronicle explained in their coverage of a screening in Detroit Wednesday, special efforts were made by producers in many cities to invite youth leaders and members of BIPOC organizations to view the film.
“We hope to encourage, uplift and motivate the young men attending this documentary screening,” said Ian Conyers, Amazon’s Head of Community Engagement for Detroit as quoted in the Chronicle’s coverage. “They will not only be filled with hope and aspiration but will also be able to share the experience among their own peers.”
The film, directed by Karam Gill and narrated by Jones himself, begins with a description of Jones’ youth. From these introductory scenes, Jones highlights a major theme of the work, that the lack of a father figure in his youth heavily influenced him to play an active role in his childrens’ lives. Throughout the film, it’s made evident that Jones cherishes the time he spends with his children. Towards the middle of the film, he explains that though his world has constantly changed since achieving fame, his children provide a priceless consistency to his new lifestyle.
Growing up, Jones found himself inspired by those in the West End neighborhood of Atlanta that were distributing and selling drugs. Jones goes on to explain that because most of the friends he made while gravitating toward the dealers in his neighborhood were older than him, he was viewed as the child or “Baby” of the group, hence his rap name, Lil Baby. 
It was at this point in the documentary that Jones reveals a bombshell: He never intended to rap in the first place. After seeing so many neighbors and peers struggle to make ends meet, Jones felt prepared to pursue an illicit lifestyle like the older dealers he had been socializing with. He explains that for him, “slow money was no money,” and the slow rise through the rap game would be long — and uncertain.
As the documentary masterfully portrays, Jones’ lifestyle did provide him with the luxuries he desired since he was a kid, but they came at a cost. 
Despite advice to distance himself from illegality from his childhood friend Jeffery Lamar Williams (better known by his stage name Young Thug) Jones’ drug involvement led to a two-year prison sentence in 2014. It was this time spent in prison, which he described as “meditative,” that allowed him to rethink his current lifestyle — to listen to those around him that encouraged Jones to rap. 
Fresh out of prison, Jones gave a childhood mentor, Pierre “P” Thomas, a call. It was during this time that P’s independent music label, “Quality Control,” was taking off thanks to the immense popularity of members like Migos. The audience is shown footage from Lil Baby’s first studio session in 2015, as five jumping fans in a tiny venue fill the screen, juxtaposing immediately with his sold-out stadium shows in the present day.
Later in the documentary, Jones discusses his first interview with the popular radio show “The Breakfast Club.” As Gill weaves in confessionals and behind-the-scenes clips with the radio interview, it’s made clear to the audience that Jones had difficulty becoming Lil Baby.
Amid shyness, insecurity in his writing ability, and uncertainty following his two-year separation from the spaces he’d known all his life, his biggest growing pain was an inability to find his own voice. In Atlanta, a city hallowed for its endlessly evolving rap sound, Jones was unsure how to separate himself from all the other innovators in town.
That was until he heard the beat for his breakout song “My Dawg.” The perfect breakout single, it not only solidified Lil Baby’s lyrical and vocal presence but painted him a unique persona as “Atlanta’s most wanted.” Lil Baby dropped hit after hit following “My Dawg,” which in 2018 landed him a feature from one of the most influential rappers of our generation, Drake. 
Following Drake’s feature on “Yes Indeed,” Lil Baby became one of the hottest rappers in recent years. As explored in the film, this rapid propulsion to the heights of rap fame was immensely turbulent for Jones, who in just two years had gone from incarceration to superstardom.
With this momentum from 2018, Lil Baby went on to drop the highest-selling album across all genres of music in 2020. However, as the filmmakers’ remark, 2020 was anything but consistent. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Jones was unable to fully experience his place at the top of the rap game. With tours and award shows postponed, Lil Baby couldn’t see the impact that his work had on the country and world — or even on his community in Atlanta.
Shifting to the present, the documentary lingers on a starkly emotional Jones, who elaborates that he spent his time in quarantine like many of us, inspired to make a difference. After witnessing the murder of George Floyd on national television, Jones said his artistic intentions began to shift. No longer would he aspire for wealth in his lyrics but for empowerment. As he summarizes in an intimate close-up, he realized he “has a voice that can inspire change.”
At the end of the film, this realization inspires him to create and release his grammy nominated song “The Bigger Picture.” Unlike anything he has released before, “The Bigger Picture” was a social commentary on police brutality and institutional racism in the United States.
With Jones’ artistic journey effectively captured, the audience is left with a closing sentiment to enjoy along with new footage of his Grammy performance. The performance, Jones explains, meant much more to him than any award or sold-out show. The performance, and further the documentary, serve as enduring video proof that a kid from the West End neighborhood of Atlanta could make it out of the trap.
“Untrapped: The Story of Lil Baby” is available for streaming now on Amazon Prime Video and is free to view with an Amazon Prime Subscription.

I sat in on the Undergraduate Student Government’s weekly Senate meeting Tuesday night, frozen in incredulous bemusement. I was transfixed by the sheer lack of self-awareness with which this assembly was conducted. It was as if I had stepped directly into the French Revolution, watching as aristocrats stuffed themselves with self-congratulatory cake. Why was I spending my evening listening to each senator rehashing their summer? Though attending this meeting was just a formality of mine to write this article, by golly gee was I glad I had been there to experience just how out of touch everyone seemed to be. 
Well, not everyone. In the midst of off-hand jokes that garnered not even the slightest sharp breath through the nose, someone in the back row asked a question I certainly had been thinking: “What efforts have you made to bring in people that don’t fit under the USG umbrella? Because everyone here, more or less, is a part of USG.” Imagine my shock when I found out I was the sole non-USG member in that room. All the speakers who had been speaking about outreach and connecting with the student body had been spouting off to … USG?
But does USG actually garner respect? Throughout the summer, I’ve had the opportunity to follow along on the trajectory of the reallocation of the Green Engagement Fund, and by the looks of it, they may not deserve it. On June 8, the Daily Trojan reported the Senate voted 7-5 to approve the budget for the coming year, effectively reallocating GEF funds to the Legislative budget, which is only available to senators and legislative committees. The bottom line? It’s going to be harder for students to get funds, especially in contrast to UCLA’s $200,000 The Green Initiative Fund for student-initiated projects. As a political science student, some of the processes that led up to this reallocation smelled of foul play, and I don’t mean the compost used by the SC Garden Club. 
I combed through hours of recordings to understand the full story, and I was shocked to find that the whole fund was cut in a mere two-week period. Valerie Kuo, a co-executive director of the Environmental Student Assembly, spoke with me about the lack of timely warning. “We were kind of blindsided because we are stakeholders in the situation, and we were never at the table when they were discussing about cutting Green Engagement Fund… a lot of the senators didn’t really know about that happening either. And we’re honestly not really informed about what they were voting for in terms of what they were cutting,” Kuo said. 
For a group that’s 142 years old, USG is certainly acting their age. With the lack of transparency and disconnect they have from their own student body, it makes me worried about other types of programs that are in line for the guillotine. As President Hannah Woodworth said herself, “There’s a reason why students aren’t reaching out to us and that means that we’re unapproachable, inaccessible. There’s an issue here, and that is our problem.”
If we were to look at the arguments against the reallocation of GEF funds, we see the desensitized nature of the leadership. The Executive Director of the Native American Student Assembly spoke of the intersectionality of environment and religion, a relationship rarely recognized by both the University and its USG. There are real, personal connections with these issues USG speak about.
Let’s get into the biggest issue of USG as we know it: The senators had also been blindsided by this information, which wouldn’t be the only time. Systematically, there is no standard or guarantee for how informed a senator must be to vote on crucial topics. Though many non-senators voiced their concern with time, three senators pointed out the importance of careful consideration, an idea seldom utilized within USG. 
Senator Aidan Feighery started, saying, “I think this Zoom chat is the epitome of the conversations that I believe should have happened to be before the budget or the creation of this budget.” Senator Paul Yi concurred, “Many of us have maybe touched this particular budget at a very recent light and haven’t had a full, holistic, broadened scope or understanding for it to be specifically geared towards the next year.” Though the fault might not be directly on them, senators are making decisions that are not informed, and this takes away from their roles in reflecting the student body.
Now, there were promises made to connect with the student body. Alvaro Florez, Speaker of the Senate, addressed this by saying, “When somebody’s drowning, I’m going to be ready to go out there and help them. And I think that’s what our Senate is going to try and do.”
I’d like to start seeing the USG take steps to be proactive in their processes, not reactive. To continue the metaphor presented, USG isn’t truly saving people, but rather placing them in vats of water for them to drown. When the problem-causers become problem-solvers, that’s not a solution. That’s Stockholm Syndrome.

With the national student debt count reaching a whopping $1.6 trillion, and debt for new graduates averaging $25,000, I was pleasantly surprised by the White House announcement on Wednesday. President Biden is promising up to $20,000 in loan forgiveness for Pell Grant recipients and $10,000 for non-Pell Grant recipients — a breath of fresh air for the 94% of Pell Grant recipients with incomes of $60,000 or less. 
Naturally — like everything else in politics — this announcement was met with immediate mixed reactions and inevitable disapproval. FOX News staff argued that education is indeed not a right, but an investment, stating “you expect to put money down because it’s going to pay off in the future.”
Suggesting that low-income individuals are making an “investment” that will actually burden them with thousands of dollars in debt for the rest of their lives is an ignorant statement that comes embarrassingly easy to white and affluent people such as FOX News guest professor Brian Brenberg.
As if this initial objection against loan forgiveness wasn’t unreasonable enough, NBC’s Instagram comments were flooded by users complaining how they didn’t get to benefit from the loan forgiveness under a post of Biden’s press conference. “The answer is YES, it is 100% unfair to those who paid off their student loans….This policy is a slap in the face to everyone who took responsibility for their debt. Unbelievable,” said Instagram user @charlitos305.
Although I understand that hearing this news after paying off one’s debt is unfortunate timing, I was disheartened to hear this “not fair” plea. No one ever said that life was fair, but that doesn’t mean one should get in the way of others avoiding unnecessary hardships in their life that have tangible, adverse effects.
What I get from statements like these is that you would rather see people suffocate in debt — likely for the rest of their lives — simply because you aren’t impoverished enough to benefit from something that is intended to pull people out of demoralizing circumstances? Give me a break. 
As Instagram user @joelswollsteen said under the same post, “Why are conservatives such haters, man? Stfu and let someone else catch a W.”
Even though this is certainly a “W” for many students such as myself, it is a step in the right direction more than anything.
In addition to the initial loan forgiveness, the White House Fact Sheet also promises discounted monthly loan payments for undergrads, forgiveness on loan balances after 10 years of payments and to cover a borrower’s monthly interest so long as monthly payments are made in a timely manner.
Even though I don’t get paid enough to solve the nation’s problems myself, I agree with Adam Looney, a Nonresident Senior Fellow with The Brookings Institution — responding with an equitable approach rather than a “one size fits all” would best benefit Americans with loans in a way that would also support our economy. 
Looney proposes that the most effective relief plan for those who need it would come in the form of IDR plans — otherwise known as “income-driven repayment plans” where monthly loan payments are calculated based on borrower’s income and all other debt is forgiven after 25 years of consistent payment. According to Looney, IDR plans could be the way to sustainably and fairly gain the favor and trust of American borrowers after decades of skepticism and resentment toward the student lending system. 
I’m sure that when the time comes, the logistics of the entire operation will be much more nuanced than what has been the case in the past because of the efforts and strong push for student loan forgiveness by activists. For now, I am happy in knowing that progress is being made for us students — regardless of age, profession or eventual graduation year. With the recent increase in tuition at USC, processing delays with financial aid and students receiving seemingly smaller and smaller aid packages, it is slightly less demoralizing that perhaps a lifetime of debt does not await us all.

Missed the rec sports fair? We’ve got you covered. Check out this quick list of USC club sports and some quick facts. 
None of these teams are officially affiliated with the University, and most will require club dues.
Note: This is not a comprehensive list of all club sports; there are over 50. Visit the club sports website for a full list and contact information.
Archery
No, you can’t shoot other people. And no, you can’t shoot other people from a mounted warhorse. But you can join a competitive archery club that accepts athletes of all skill levels. 
Practices run Wednesdays and Fridays, and most competition will happen at tournaments within California. Some archers will also compete in the collegiate national tournament.
IG: @trojanarchery
Baseball
The club baseball team’s looking for athletes who played at a competitive level in high school — pitchers are usually throwing somewhere in the low 80s — to join its roster. The team practices two to three times a week in the fall, and ramps it up to four or five times in the spring. 
On the weekends, the men play in the Southern Pacific West Conference of the National Club Baseball Association.
IG: @clubbaseballusc
Men’s basketball
These dudes are serious about their basketball. The A team consists of athletes who transferred from (or had offers from) DIII schools and those who played at a high level in high school; the B team is for players looking for a “balance of school and basketball”; the C team is a commitment level under that. There’s even a “development league,” too.
All teams have rosters of around twelve — though that can fluctuate. The A and B teams play in the National Club Basketball Association and practice two or three times a week. The C team scrimmages other club teams in the state and practices one or two times a week. 
IG: @uscmcbb
Women’s basketball
A handful of recent graduates have left several vacancies on the team, and club women’s basketball is looking for players to fill those spots. Athletes of a wide variety of skill levels — from no experience to former varsity high school athletes — are welcome to try out.
The team doesn’t play in any official leagues but will enter into scrimmages and tournaments against other club teams — and in fact, won a regional tournament in Texas last semester.
IG: @uscwclubball
Boxing
If you were bummed that you couldn’t shoot other people in the archery club, at least know that you can punch other people here. 
Practices run Tuesdays and Thursdays, and are open to all skill levels. In the past, the club has competed against UCLA, and a handful of club members even compete in amateur boxing. All genders are welcome.
IG: @trojanboxing
Cheer
Athletes of all skill levels are welcome here, though most have prior dance, gymnastics or cheer experience. The team holds practices on Tuesdays and Sundays, and competes in competitions in February and April. 
The roster is currently all women, but non-women are welcome to try out.
IG: @officialusccheer
Climbing
With some 150 people in the climbing club, there is plenty of space for those looking to traverse, belay and boulder. All are welcome. The club trains throughout the year — on Mondays and Wednesdays — for regional and national competitions in the spring.
IG: @trojanclimbing
Cricket
Try something different. Play cricket. You can either try out for the roughly 30-person competition team — which plays in the Southern California Cricket Association and practices Tuesdays and Thursdays — or just come out to more casual rec games on Friday nights.
IG: @usccricket
Ice hockey
Some players on the roster have played juniors and prep, and some are still learning the game. Practice runs on Monday nights at Lakewood, with one or two games a weekend during the season.
IG: @usctrojanshockey
Ping pong
Legit professionals. People who’ve never even played the game. All are welcome at the “Ping Pong Posse.” The club practices Tuesdays and Thursdays, and competes at three tournaments a year.
IG: @uscpingpong
Men’s rugby
The rugby team won the national championship last spring for sevens, and plays a mix of Division I and club opponents. Despite the team’s accolades, it’s not uncommon for beginners to join the squad. Practices run Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Competition happens roughly every weekend.
IG: @usctrojansrugby
Women’s rugby
Most girls try out with no prior experience. Practices run Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, and the team will play schools such as UC Davis and San Jose State. 
IG: @trojanswrugby
Men’s soccer
Due to the lack of a DI men’s soccer team, around 150 athletes come to tryouts — the final roster cuts down to about 30. Most club members have played soccer their whole lives and at a competitive club or high school level. Practices run Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, and the team competes in the West Coast Soccer Association. 
IG: @uscmenssoccer
Women’s soccer
Most on the team have played high school and club soccer, and the club strives to play at a relatively high level of competition while fostering a fun and social environment. There are cut tryouts. The team practices Mondays and Wednesdays, and, once the season starts, plays games about every weekend against in-state teams and at tournaments.
IG: @scwomensclubsoccer
Softball
This squad’s looking for players with prior experience but will take inexperienced players if they do well in tryouts. The athletes play other club teams on the weekends and practice on Mondays and Wednesdays.
IG: @trojanssoftball
Swimming
The team typically practices three or four days a week. There’s a huge range of skill levels, from former Olympic and DI swimmers to people who’ve never swam competitively. The team usually attends swim meets against other California schools.
IG: @uscswimclub
Track and field
There are no tryouts; the club’s seeking to build a social running community that’s also focused on competition. The club is registered with the National Intercollegiate Running Club Association and practice times will vary depending on event group. 
There is a varsity squad that competes in some more competitive meets, though everybody has the chance to compete against other club teams at schools such as UCLA.
IG: @uscclubtrack
Men’s volleyball
The men’s club volleyball team tends to make a fair number of cuts in tryouts, and its A and B teams have placed highly in their respective divisions in the national tournament in the past. Most play happens within the Southern California Collegiate Volleyball League. Practices run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
IG: @uscclubvball
Women’s volleyball
Like the men’s team, women’s club volleyball also has an A and B team — and most athletes played for high school and club teams. Practices are on Mondays and Wednesdays. All games take place in tournaments, most within driving distance.
IG: @uscwclubvball
Wrestling
The roster of around 20 is open to all skill levels and genders. Practices run Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, and competition occurs within the National Collegiate Wrestling Association.

Popular belief tells us that proximity and locality create fanbases for sports clubs and organizations. NFL, NBA and other professional sports franchises started in populated and culturally-rich regions. Although large markets attract fans nationwide, few sports teams embody a homogenous philosophy, economic background or political affiliation. 
Many soccer clubs, especially in Europe, symbolize their respective community’s psychographics due to their generally long and extensive history. FC St. Pauli, nestled in a working-class district, epitomizes that precise adherence to the fullest extent. The small club from Hamburg, Germany is arguably the zaniest yet endearing team that all new soccer fans should consider flocking to.
As an avid soccer fan myself, I’ve always found the sport’s fanbases peculiar and uniquely intrinsic to the sport itself. Not only do clubs reflect the distinctive identity of a specific community, but they also mirror class dynamics in individual cities. Rivalries also convey longstanding, hotly-contested tensions between different positions and societies. From the political derby between Barcelona and Real Madrid to the nationalistic vendetta between Celtic and Rangers, each rivalry is a microcosm of societal dynamics. In this column, I will not only introduce you to distinctive soccer clubs with equally differentiating fanbases, but I will also review rivalries with ties to historical affairs. 
Conception
Starting as a gymnastics club in 1907, FC St. Pauli became an official soccer club in 1910. However, in 1963 Bundesliga, the ruling German soccer association, denied FC St. Pauli permission to participate in league play due to their provision of allowing only one club from a particular city admission. Hamburg SV, their club neighbors and local rivals, were instead given acceptance. FC St. Pauli was eventually allowed admission in 1974. 
Through turbulent times oscillating between the premier division in Germany and lower-tier amateur leagues, FC St. Pauli has comfortably cemented their standing in 2. Bundesliga, the second-ranked soccer league in the country, and have remained there since. 
Transformation 
In the 1980s, FC St. Pauli fans revolted against the organization and formed their flag, which brandished a skull and crossbones symbol. Fans argued that they wanted to resist past perversion of the emblem tied to piracy and instead have it depict an anti-establishment rejection of the upper economic caste. 
In 2009, FC St. Pauli was the first professional German club to produce and release guiding principles that illustrated the organization’s effort to provide an inclusive and diverse environment for the surrounding community. The club’s philosophy, in essence, profoundly resists any type of discrimination based on race, religion, sexual orientation and other identities. 
European Football Hooliganism
FC St. Pauli’s swift transformation into a cult-like organization adamant against prejudices also reflects the growing popularity of violent, intolerant hooliganism running rampant across Europe. Football’s international governing body, FIFA, investigated Russia ahead of the 2018 World Cup due to their history of obscene chants directed at Black soccer players. Fans of Russian football outfit Zenit St. Petersburg protested against the signing of Brazilian winger Malcolm de Oliveira and stated that “the absence of black players is an important tradition.” 
Italy’s professional football associations have also struggled with racism. In 2019, Serie A, the highest ranked Italian division, responded to the growing number of racist chants involving the word ‘monkey’ against athletes of color in 2019 with a supposed anti-racist campaign that depicted apes of different “nationalities.” The artist, Simone Fugazzotto, claimed that he intended to “stop censoring the word monkey” and ultimately argue that “we are all monkeys.” Needless to say, the campaign, if you can call it that, was met with profound criticism. 
Hamburg isn’t a stranger to violent, ultra fan groups. During the early 1980s, right-wing extremist fans started attending Hamburg SV’s games and dissuaded alternative fans flocked to FC St. Pauli. At the turn of the century, the rivalry between the Hamburg clubs transitioned from a political difference to an economic contrast, as Hamburg SV now represents the upper class in Hamburg. 
FC St. Pauli’s continued effort to create a welcoming organization for individuals of diverse identities amid the harrowing occurrences of fan discrimination is one to marvel at. Whether an experienced soccer fan or a newcomer, I highly suggest following the small,   tight-knit club from Hamburg.
