Thanks for the podcast; as a Trojan fan who has followed the team for 60 years, I was shocked by the atrocious play calling Sat night.  If you don’t have balance in your offense it makes it very difficult to win.  Balance means a verticle passing game; I am not necessarily talking about 40 yd bombs; I about fell out of my seat when on 3 and 15 andfrom  midfield Kiffin tried a basic handoff up the middle for virtually no gain.  What in God’s name have the Trojans been doing since the debacle against Georgia Tech? I have seen better play calling at my local pop warner league.  Ok, Kessler is the starter; give him a fair chance to run the complete offense. If he isn’t performing after a reasonable try, then switch to Wittek or Browne.  Lane’s its now or never against a very soft schedule.  
FIGHT ON MEN OF TROY!!!!!  FIGHT ON!!!!!!!!!

The USC women’s basketball team released its regular-season schedule on Tuesday, and it features plenty of tough opponents as well as plenty of opportunities for new head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke to prove her program is headed back in the right direction.
Rough road ahead · Junior forward Alexyz Vaioletama faces a tough task in leading her team to the NCAA tournament in Nashville, Tenn. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy will have 18 of their 31 games televised, including all but one of their conference games (Jan. 12 at Arizona). Their game at Stanford on Jan. 27 will be televised on ESPN2, with all others available on the Pac-12 Network.
Coming off of an 11-20 season a year ago and a seventh-place finish in the Pac-12 with a 7-11 record, USC will begin its season on the road against UC Davis on Nov. 8 and Fresno State on Nov. 10. Last year, the Women of Troy suffered a 78-69 loss to the Aggies and 65-60 loss to the Bulldogs.
Their home opener will be on Nov. 13 against San Diego State at 4 p.m. After a trip to Stillwater, Okla. to take on Oklahoma State on Nov. 22, they will play their first televised game of the season against South Carolina on Nov. 25 at the Galen Center.
The team will then travel out of the country for the Mayan Tournament at the Cancun Challenge in Cancun, Mexico, from Nov. 28-30, where they will face Iowa, UNC Wilmington (where Cooper-Dyke coached from 2010-12) and Boston College.
USC will open its Pac-12 schedule with games at UCLA on Dec. 30 and home games against Colorado on Jan. 3 and Utah on Jan. 5. The team will face a tough final weekend of home games when it takes on Stanford on Feb. 21 and California on Feb. 23. The Women of Troy had a combined record of 0-5 against these two teams last season, losing by an average of 13.6 points per game.
They’ll close out the regular season on the road against Utah and Colorado on Feb. 27 and March 2, respectively.
USC will face eight teams that qualified for last year’s NCAA tournament — Stanford, California, UCLA, South Carolina, Colorado, Fresno State, San Diego State and Oklahoma State — along with eight that were either ranked or received votes in the final 2013 AP Poll. Stanford, California, UCLA, South Carolina, and Colorado all finished the season ranked, while Oklahoma State, Iowa, and San Diego State received votes. USC’s 23 opponents had a combined winning percentage of .573 in the 2012-13 season, meaning very little will come easily for the Women of Troy this season.
The Pac-12 Tournament will take place from March 6-9 in Seattle, Wash. for the second consecutive year. The Women of Troy will look to make it deeper into the tournament this season, after falling to California in the quarterfinals 78-59.
The NCAA Tournament, which USC last qualified for in the  2005-06 season, will start with the first and second rounds from March 22-25. The regionals will go from March 29 to April 1, and the Women’s Final Four will be held in Nashville, Tenn. on April 6 and 8.

After falling down to 10 strokes behind the leaders during day one of the Dale McNamara Fall Preview, the USC women’s golf team made up over half of that deficit in Tuesday’s second round with an impressive all-around showing.
The Women of Troy began their morning at Tulsa Country Club in a fairly distant eighth place, but benefited from strong individual performances and poor play by day one leader Oklahoma State to move into a fourth place tie by day’s end.
Sophomore Annie Park, the defending NCAA individual champion, returned to form in round two with a team-leading 2-under 68. After Monday’s error-filled 5-over performance, Park remains five strokes behind the two-day leaders.
One of those leaders is USC sophomore Kyung Kim, who stayed consistent with her second consecutive 1-under 69. Kim is tied atop the individual leaderboard after two rounds with Duke’s Laetitia Beck, Arizona State’s Noemi Jimenez and Tulane’s Emily Penttila.
It should not come as a surprise that Kim has started the fall season with two sub-70 rounds. The Arizona native racked up a team-high six rounds in the 60s during the Women of Troy’s national title run last spring. That same consistency could propel Kim and her team to a return trip to Tulsa, Okla. for the 2014 NCAA finals.
Though Kim may have had eight sub-70 rounds in her young career, the USC career record in that category belongs to her teammate, senior Sophia Popov. Unfortunately, Popov continued to struggle in her first event of the fall season, posting a 4-over 74 on Tuesday.
While Popov may be a daunting nine strokes off the lead, it is doubtful that this will be a precursor of a letdown year for one of the best golfers in USC history. In three events last fall, Popov never finished higher than fifth and fell outside the top 10 twice.
She then went on to a prolific spring season, winning once and finishing second twice, while setting several USC records along the way.
Freshman Gabriella Then continued to impress in her first collegiate event, posting a 3-over 73 to complement her 1-over performance in round one. Then is six strokes off the lead with Wednesday’s final round still to come.
Though the team’s improvement in round two is heartening, the Women of Troy still have a lot of work to do in Wednesday’s final round to come away with a victory. Each of the top four teams in the NCAA rankings remain in contention, including No. 3 Duke, the two-day leader. No. 4 Oklahoma is in second place, while round-one leader No. 16 Oklahoma State fell to third. USC, locked in a fourth place tie with No. 2 Alabama, might be just three strokes behind the Blue Devils, but competition will be fierce on the tournament’s last day.
If the Women of Troy’s 21-stroke victory over Duke in last season’s NCAA finals is any indication, they certainly have a real chance to capture a comeback victory. Also compelling will be the individual race, which will feature Kim and Park competing for their second and fifth career wins, respectively.

After another stalled drive against Washington State, USC’s star wide receiver, junior Marqise Lee, who will almost certainly be nabbing passes from an NFL quarterback a year from now, stormed off the field.
He yanked off his helmet and screamed in frustration in the direction of the stands that were once filled with cheers but were now rife with boos and chants of “Fire Kiffin.”
Two years removed from a 10-2 season in which the Trojans clobbered UCLA 50-0 to finish the year, the result for USC’s players, many of whom were on that 2011 team, on Saturday was a 10-7 loss at the hands of a Washington State team that couldn’t muster an offensive touchdown.
For Lee, who didn’t catch a pass longer than 10 yards for the first time since his first game at USC, talent will win out over statistics when it comes to his draft status next April. Regardless of how much his production drops this season, his athleticism and overall pedigree ensure that he will be a first round pick. Senior outside linebacker Morgan Breslin, who had two sacks and looked to be at full strength coming off of an injury, will still hear his name called in the early rounds.
This USC roster is brimming with elite talent, stockpiled by USC head coach Lane Kiffin and his predecessor Pete Carroll. And therein lies the real shame of the Trojans’ newfound ineptitude. How unfair is it for the Trojans that, despite a plethora of talent up and down the roster, the startling incompetence of two quarterbacks and their head coach can snowball into a loss to one of the Pac-12’s least talented squads?
The portion of blame between Kiffin and his two signal-callers is up for debate, but there is little doubt that the quarterback situation has become a hot mess.
It was USC’s biggest question coming into 2013 following the 21-7 loss to Georgia Tech in the Sun Bowl that left an unpalatable taste in the mouth of every Trojan supporter. After the quarterback duo struggled in an ugly 30-13 season-opening win over Hawai’i, the pair’s performance went up in flames on Saturday. Redshirt sophomores Cody Kessler and Max Wittek each played a half, and combined to throw for 54 yards with an interception each.
Kessler was named the starter for the foreseeable future on Monday, and with that announcement should come a system tailored to his strengths and set up to mask his weaknesses. The damage, however, has been done.
Many top recruits were in attendance for Saturday’s game. Expecting to see the supremely confident and talented Trojans wallop the Cougars back to Pullman, Wash., they instead were treated to a night full of bubble screens and redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Madden (admirably) punching the ball up the middle. Highly touted defensive ends Kylie Fitts and Eddie Vanderdoes decommitted last year after the 7-6 debacle, as did safety commit Max Redfield. Even with Kiffin’s reputation as a recruiting guru, games such as last Saturday’s, where the standout performance of the entire defense was wasted, are the type that make commits re-evaluate their prospects and move the Trojans down a notch on their wish lists.
The worst betrayal in all of this, though, is suffered by the players already on the Trojan roster. USC’s defense has been outstanding in 2013, allowing three points to a Cougar offense that put up 24 points against Auburn the week before. On Saturday night, it felt as if USC had a better chance of putting points on the board when the Cougars had the ball, rather than when the Trojans did. The level of frustration after constantly stopping your opponent only to see your offense sputter must have been unimaginable.
Sophomore defensive tackle Leonard Williams looked lost as he wandered around the far side of the field following the final whistle. A highly sought-after recruit in high school, Williams chose USC over football powerhouses in his home state of Florida. So far, he’s been treated to a 7-6 season and now, this. Sophomore wideout Nelson Agholor also made the cross-country trek from Florida, and the Trojans’        No. 2 wide receiver was targeted just once on Saturday and has only two receptions all season.
There’s no doubt the 2011 season was a feather in Kiffin’s cap, but USC has now lost six of its last eight games. The players won’t ever admit it, but if on-field emotions and body language were any indicator, they have to be wondering why they are at USC if the incompetence of one coach and two quarterbacks can torpedo their collective efforts.
Nearly all college football coaches lure talent with the promise of being part of a winning program. And though USC went 7-6 last season, there was at least some competence on offense until the Sun Bowl disaster — at least more than 54 passing yards’ worth.
Redshirt junior defensive end George Uko, who forced the fumble that led to USC’s only score of the game, was sobbing as he left the field Saturday night. He didn’t choose USC because he wanted to lose to Washington State at home. None of these Trojans did. Yet that’s the new reality. It’s not fair to the players, and it has to change.

Excellent, if sobering article.  Given the sorry performance of these QBs, writ large frankly throughout the Pac12, USC needs to wake up and smell the coffee: get a Texas quarterback.  That’s where they come from these days.  I know we all love the Mater Deis of the world and all the local “talent,” but the plain fact is that the best QBs are in Texas and USC would do well to finally go out there and get itself one.  Interestingly, after California, the most represented state in the student body is Texas.  it’s not as if USC doesn’t know how to recruit there!
Salvation = Texas QB

For the second week in a row the Trojans will match up against a less talented team they are expected to beat — this time, the Boston College Eagles. Unlike the Washington State Cougars and their air raid attack, however, the Eagles feature a power run offense, mirroring the tactics of traditional SEC squads. USC head coach Lane Kiffin, even among rampant cries for his dismissal, is excited for that challenge and believes it should be a good test for his squad, which is trying to rebound from its shocking loss to Washington State last weekend.
Ready to go · Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler said he is excited about the chance to seize the starting job. “It was very exciting for me,” Kessler said. “[Kiffin] gave me the keys to the car … the keys to the team.” – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“They have a great physical running back and the offensive line is well-coached,” Kiffin said about the Eagles. “They have a great playmaker at receiver and an extremely mobile defense. They’re heavy on the run and try to open it up with the play action. It’s a Stanford type of offense.”
The Trojan defense has played phenomenally up to this point under the direction of the new defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast, but this week, it will face its toughest test yet against Boston College tailback Andre Williams. The senior is averaging 5.5 yards a carry this season, but will most certainly be going up against the most talented defense he’s seen this season on Saturday.
Though the Eagles certainly have a number of playmakers on offense, most Trojan fans will have their eyes glued to the USC offense to see if it can rebound after an awful performance against Washington State.
“Lets Roll.”
That was the simple message delivered to quarterback Cody Kessler from Kiffin on Sunday night when he told the redshirt sophomore he would be Trojans’ starter going forward, ending the indecision that seemed to plague the offense in its first two games.
“I’m not trying to make excuses, but those first two weeks I would be lying if I said it wasn’t affecting me,” Kessler said. “It’s tough to focus on winning the game when you’re worrying about other things. [Being named the starter] instills a confidence I didn’t have in the first two weeks.”
The news is obviously a dream come true for Kessler, but he quickly needs to turn his attention to fixing up the anemic USC offense, which has mustered just 226 total passing yards during the Trojans’ first two games of the 2013 season against Hawai’i and Washington State.
“I don’t feel accomplished those last two games when [I didn’t] play like [I] wanted to,” Kessler said. “It’s great everyone’s behind me, and now we’re ready to go.”
Coach’s dream 
Possibly the most concerning number for the Trojans from the game against the Cougars is 27.
Twenty-seven is the number of yards that Heisman hopeful Marqise Lee had Saturday, far below his baseline productivity from last season. Questions and concerns have been swirling about the standout junior wideout and how Kiffin is wasting his talents calling screen after screen, picking up only a handful of yards at a time.
Lee, however, does not seem  at all flustered, either about his performance or Kiffin’s playcalling.
“I’ll keep running screens or doing whatever Kiffin and the coaches need me to do,” Lee said. “It’s not about [getting Lee the ball more often], it’s more about involving everyone else.”
Players only 
One thing Lee touched on after practice was how great the last two days have been for the Trojans and how focused everyone has seemed following the loss. Aiding in that cause, in Lee and Kiffin’s opinion, is a players-only meeting that was conducted Sunday.
“We had an open conversation and some guys said the things they haven’t been able to say,” Lee said.
When asked if the players were worried about the crowd chanting “Fire Kiffin” on Saturday, Lee did not seem phased.
“Kiffin’s gonna be there,” Lee said. “I don’t pay attention to it … As a team we’re going to continue to do what we’ve got to do.”

Dean of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Ernest J. Wilson III, will appoint Sarah Banet-Weiser as the new director of the School of Communication in summer 2014, Annenberg announced Monday.
Banet-Weiser will succeed Larry Gross, who has held the position since 2003. Though Gross will no longer hold this position, he will remain a vice dean and faculty member at Annenberg.
Banet-Weiser has worked as a professor at Annenberg in the School of Communication since 1999. She is also a professor at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in the American Studies and Ethnicity department. Banet-Weiser teaches courses in feminist theory, youth culture and gender and media, among other subjects. She has written four books and co-authored one, including The Most Beautiful Girl in the World: Beauty Pageants and National Identity.
“While my own scholarship emerges from the subfield of culture and communication, I’m looking forward to continuing to build the department in all areas of the field — from health communication to organizational communication to rhetoric to new and digital technologies and other subfields,” Banet-Weiser told USC Annenberg News. “We have great opportunities and resources here at USC Annenberg, and I am honored to be asked to help continue building our department in the years to come.”
Banet-Weiser has already received many accolades from the university, including a USC Mellon Mentoring Award, and is a fellow at the USC Center for Excellence in Teaching,  through which she participates in the Future Professoriate Program.
Gross said Banet-Weiser is well-equipped to take over as director next fall.
“She sees the academic mission as one that has wider social responsibilities that translate into what you teach, how you teach and how you think about working with students,” Gross told USC Annenberg News. “It’s not an ivory tower mentality, but one that understands that the university, as a privileged institution, must contribute to society.”

Tapingo, a food ordering app geared toward college students, has just launched at USC.
Takeout · Students can now order food from campus center eateries and neighborhood restaurants using the smartphone app Tapingo. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Tapingo, which calls itself an “Online & Mobile Food Directory,” allows students to place meal delivery and takeout orders either online or via their smartphones to eateries in the local area. The app is compatible with both the iPhone and the Android operating system.
Students can use Tapingo at USC to order and pick up food from eateries at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, Starbucks and Coffee Bean. The app accepts discretionary funds from school IDs, as well as credit or PayPal. Students can also use Tapingo to order food to be delivered from local restaurants, including Pizza Rustica and Viztango Cafe.
With the slogan “Great Food. Less Waiting,” the service advertises its ability to allow users to avoid long lines and wait times. Users have the option to either call ahead and pick up or have the food delivered right to their doorstep. Orders are customizable, and the app remembers preferences, such as specific restaurant favorites and topping choices.
In a press release, Tapingo CEO Daniel Almog expressed his excitement over joining the USC community.
“We are proud to have USC join the existing 25 universities to have successfully launched Tapingo on campus,” Almog said. “The deal brings us one step closer to our vision of Tapingo as a lifestyle app that transforms the everyday shopping experiences of the modern consumer.”
Dirk De Jong, associate director of operations for USC Hospitality, believes that Tapingo will benefit student life.
“Tapingo represents exactly the kind of tech-driven innovation USC seeks to deliver and inspire among its world-class student body,” De Jong said. “By streamlining the process of ordering and picking up food, students can spend more time working and socializing. In that sense, Tapingo is the perfect complement to USC’s brand and educational experience.”
Campus administrators said they considered other food ordering applications and tried to develop their own before they eventually decided to partner with Tapingo.
“We spoke to a few different companies that offered similar solutions,” USC Director of Hospitality Kris Klinger said. “Tapingo had the best depth and breadth, particularly in regard to the higher education space.”
According to Klinger, there are plans for Tapingo to expand to all the campus dining facilities, as well as more local quick service eateries in the near future.
For many students on campus, the new addition of Tapingo will ease the stress of lunchtime lines. On its Facebook page, Tapingo claims that students spend an average of eight days a year waiting in lines for food.
Darrin Jin, a junior majoring in psychology, is excited to use the app to cut down on the time it takes to get food.
“I absolutely hate waiting in lines during the midday rush. As a full time student balancing a job, this definitely could make life a little easier,” Jin said.
Many believe the app will simply make ordering food more convenient and enjoyable.
“I think it’s a cool concept,” said Jade Ponciano, a freshman majoring in neuroscience. “That’d definitely be nice to be able to order food right from my phone and not sit around in line.”
Caroline Heer, a senior majoring in fine art, finds the concept of Tapingo useful, even though she often eats at home.
“It sounds kind of tempting. I think a lot of people, especially those in dorms, could use this,” Heer said.
The administration is expecting positive responses to the partnership with this app.
“It’s about convenience more than anything else,” Klinger said. “It’s something the students have been asking for.”

USC Undergraduate Student Government held its first open house Tuesday night to recruit new members for the 2013-14 school year. Students who attended the event at the USG office in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center received pizza, Red Bull along with information about USG’s various programs and committees.
Representatives from USG’s Senate, Program Board and Executive Cabinet attended the event and met prospective members. USG Senior Director of Communications Olivia Diamond organized the event.
“It was exciting to see a lot of new faces out here … We want everyone to know that joining USG is a great opportunity; it lets you make what you want to happen at USC happen,” Diamond said.
Student applicants arrived with various ideas on improving on-campus events, such as concerts and social gatherings. Some students had already attended open meetings that USG’s Program Board held last year.
“I like the meetings the Program Board has, and I want to get more involved,” said Jesse Torres, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering. “Most of all, I want the student body to be entertained, and [for there to be] a good atmosphere around campus.”
Other students, particularly freshmen, said they were interested in USG because of previous experiences they had participating in high school student government.
“Student government was sort of the peak of my time in high school,” said April Sandoval, a freshman majoring in business administration. I learned a lot about myself as a leader, and I want leadership to be a part of my college experience as well.”
The open house is USG’s second major recruitment event this week, following a promotional event near Tommy Trojan on Tuesday afternoon.
“I’m really pleased with the overall turnout,” said USG President Christian Kurth. I think of all the recent years, this is the biggest turnout we’ve had, especially for the first night.”
USG officers will host a second open house Wednesday night for students who were not able to attend the first. USG officers are optimistic about the upcoming event.
“Tomorrow we’re expecting even more people. We’re looking for students who are involved and ambitious,” Kurth said. “I’m hoping to break some records with applications.”

USC ranked 23rd on the 2014 U.S. News and World Report National University Rankings, tying with Carnegie Mellon, UCLA, University of Virginia and Wake Forest University. Both USC and UCLA increased their rankings after tying for 24th place last year.
“Universities that tie for the same place can be alike in some ways. For instance, USC and UCLA are both fairly large, research universities,” said Jerome Lucido, research professor of education and executive director of the USC Center for Enrollment Research, Policy, and Practice. “But there are other universities that are not alike, such as Rochester and Caltech, that you find it hard to believe the same criteria can be used to rate its quality.”
U.S. News and World Report  altered its methodology for determining the rankings this year, putting less emphasis on freshman academics and more emphasis on graduation rates.
“Graduation rates are an important measure of commitment to student goals, an area where USC has excelled,” Lucido said. “This is one of the values of the rankings because universities commit to greater student success.”
Lucido noted that though the rankings might seem like an easy, objective comparison of a wide variety of schools, they can overlook important factors that define a particular university.
“The rankings are a statement of wealth and selectivity and less about quality,” Lucido said. “Frankly, you can’t tell if one institution is better than another. Students should look at the character and environment of the school as well. People use [the rankings] for reassurance and external validation.”
Some students agreed with Lucido that rankings are not the best way to determine a school’s quality.
“I do think rankings are a little important because a lot of students tend to make their decisions based on it even though they’re not the best predictor of a school,” said Achyuth Sriram, a junior majoring in neuroscience. “If we are tied with a good school, it can help us. I think the rankings are important -— but only for prospective students, not for students who already go here.”
Many students felt USC’s improvement in the rankings over the past few years reflects well on the school.
“Hopefully this increase in rank is only the beginning of USC’s rise to the top,” said Kevin Liu, a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering.

“Fag.” “Yeah, but she’s a slut anyway.” “Mexicans are lazy, though.” “Don’t Jew me.”
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
These are just a few of the phrases that the Women’s Student Assembly, an advocacy group that falls under Program Board, included on fliers leading up to an Wednesday event intended to explore discussions of race, class and gender. The posters, which sparked conversation among some and offended others, were meant to depict insensitive language that some students face regularly.
“We wanted to start a discussion around the way some people experience discrimination every day and bring awareness to that, because a lot of people hardly ever experience language that targets or offends their entire community,” said Kaya Masler, a director of WSA.
The advertisements were posted around campus, though many were taken down by Monday. Neither WSA nor Program Board was responsible for removing them, Masler said, though she speculated that it was possible that individuals had removed the signs.
The Division of Student Affairs oversees advertising at USC. According to the division’s regulations, as outlined in SCampus, content of printed material cannot contain “fighting words,” speech that, “considered objectively, is abusive and insulting rather than a communication of ideas.”
Several students said they felt the signs encouraged discussion and a dialogue about slurs. Jennifer Joseph, a senior majoring in human performance, said that though she never saw the signs, she heard about them from a group of friends who saw them.
“It gets people to talk for sure,” Joseph said. “We were all curious about what they were there for.”
The event, “PLUG IN: An Interactive Workshop on Race, Class and Gender,” will run Wednesday from 7 to 9 p.m. at Ground Zero Performance Cafe. Due to scheduling, the event falls on the 12th anniversary of the attacks on 9/11, which Masler said was not intentional but a fact not lost on the event’s planners.
“We’re going to do a moment of silence for the victims of 9/11 at the event, and it’s kind of about working past isolationist fears as a community and as a nation,” Masler said.
Masler recognizes that not all students took kindly to the insensitive language on the flyers.
“I think some people were [offended],” Masler said. “They should be. But, once again, this campaign is not intended at all to condone this language but rather to encourage people to get angry about it and respond to it.”
Emily He, a sophomore majoring in biology, was one of the students who said she was turned off by the language on the signs.
“It’s just uncomfortable,” He said. “I found some of the flyers a little bit offensive, so it didn’t make me interested in reading any further at what the fliers had to say.”
Even some supporters of the event worry that the inclusion of sensitive language could lead to misinterpretation.
“It was edgy, but I’m afraid it could be interpreted [in] the wrong way,” said Josh Fasky, a senior majoring in neuroscience. “Impact versus intent is a very fine line to navigate and should be approached carefully.”
The Political Student Assembly, the Black Student Assembly, the Latino/a Student Assembly, the Queer People of Color Club and Lambda Upsilon Lambda are all co-sponsoring the event.
The fliers for the Ground Zero event are not the only campaign that has attempted to draw attention to insensitive language. The LGBT Resource Center created fliers for resident advisors that list derogatory slurs and how they might hurt students. Some of these phrases include “b-tch,” “ghetto,” “whore” and “that’s so gay.”
“[It’s] to put it out there that people should rethink the language they use and how certain words can affect an individual negatively and how we should think before we speak,” said Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center.
Vigil said the fliers are part of a campaign called “Words that Hurt and Why,” which is part of the center’s Ally Project.
Masler ultimately hopes that, through group workshops at the event, students will gain tools and approaches to deal with discrimination based on race, class or gender.
“I don’t think the event is about political correctness as much as it is about being aware of what one another goes through and being better allies of one another’s experiences and struggles,” Masler said. “It’s not so much about policing each other as it is about helping each other be more culturally and racially sensitive.”

“Mexicans are not lazy” that’s for sure. Well, I’m looking forward to weekend home games, because I like watching all the hot white-girls on the row, get “whitegirl wasted”….bwahahahaaha.
I’m having Pres. Nikias investigate your
completely subjective Moderation Committee.
Be prepared.
Who is in charge of the Moderation Committee?
Why is my piece being suppressed?
I thought we students are supposed to be Open Minded
and Tolerant of EveryOne’s viewpoints ?
What a complete joke this is !!
Why did you leave out these phrases?:
“white CRACKER”  “whitey” “white BOY”
“she’s a white piece of meat” etc etc etc.
What kind of Racist Agenda is really being advanced here?
It’s pretty obvious who the REAL racists are…
white people do not experience racism.
if you, FarzI, really think that CRACKER or WHITEY is offensive, you need to take a class on race and colonization or some sort of crash course on white privilege.
RACISM does not equal hurt feelings.

There are certain dance moves that distinguish themselves as accomplishments of the human physique: the Charleston, the Twist, the moonwalk, and so on. Other styles remain well-kept secrets of their respective scenes until suddenly they are thrust into the mainstream and appropriated by the masses.
One such dance trend is twerking. The word “twerk” boasts a rich etymology. It is considered a mix of “twist” and “work,” “twitch” and “jerk” or any such combination. The exact origins of twerking are somewhat disputed — it bears resemblance to a West African dance called the mapouka, yet the most modern form of the enthusiastic dance probably originates from the New Orleans bounce music scene.
For those who have only heard of the word and not seen any sort of Internet video displaying someone twerking (what’s it like to live under a rock?), twerking is stylized booty popping. Depending on the situation and the dancer, it can be mesmerizing and even admirable, but in other cases it is alarming and downright appalling.
Though current pop culture might suggest that twerking is a new craze, in reality it has been around since 1993. This was the year that bounce artist DJ Jubilee told his crowd to “Twerk baby, twerk baby, twerk, twerk, twerk” in his booty-bumping anthem, “Do The Jubilee All.” Following DJ Jubilee, other bounce artists began to use the word and concept in their music, launching a style that would eventually dominate the airwaves, in one form or another.
Bounce is an up-tempo style of music that relies heavily on bass and is ideal for fast-paced, booty-popping moves. Mainstream artists such as The Ying Yang Twins, Justin Timberlake and Queen Bey herself took notice of twerking during the early half of the last decade. Each artist used the suggestive word in hits such as “Whistle While You Twurk,” “Sexyback” and “Check On It.” Returning the dance movement to its Southern roots, Fuse will be debuting a reality show in October about Queen Diva Big Freedia, a NoLa bounce rapper whose influence in the twerkosphere has been monumental.
Let’s face the facts: people have probably been shaking their lower halves as a form of dance since dance emerged as a means of expression. A rhythmically swaying, nicely shaped ass is more hypnotizing than a psychiatrist’s pendulum. That is just plain science.
Though the South might have been privy to the glory that is twerking longer than the rest of us, it is a dance craze that has recently spread throughout the rest of the country like wildfire, especially since this year’s MTV Video Music Awards. A certain tongue-baring singer definitely made a name for the dance move; if there was any doubt people had never heard of twerking before the awards show, that doubt has now been eradicated in a flurry of teddy bears.
On the other hand, there is so much more to this dance move than meets the eye. Twerking exists in multiple forms, each difficult and awe-inspiring in their own right. Some dancers twerk while bent over — an observer might refer to these as traditionalists. Others twerk against walls and still others assume a crouching position in which their moneymaker is thrust repeatedly to the tune of a thumping bass.
Twerking is actually an effective workout that will leave you breathless and toned. Wall-twerking not only works your lower back and other obvious parts of your body, but it requires arm strength to properly support your body as it defies gravity and possibly the manners your mama taught you.
Even just the squat and thrust position is akin to a wall sit since you are relying on the stability of your legs to support your body’s movement. If you’re really dedicated to making your dance session into a twerkout, you could probably infuse the dance with arm weights. Go crazy; it’s your twerk and you can do what you want.
Therein lies the beauty of twerking, as is the case with other dance styles and moves that have come before it. A general structure must be understood but once this technique is mastered, or at least marginally accomplished, the individual dancer can incorporate his or her own personality and quirks to make it their own.
Once you get more comfortable with moving your butt in time with whatever beat you’re following, leg movements are a common addition to twerking. When watching videos on YouTube, such as those of the Atlanta-based Twerk Team, this might appear to be easy but it actually requires some finesse.
Les danse des fesses are a subtle art that requires vigorous practice — practice that is best done in the privacy of your own room with a mirror. You might think you can twerk, but merely moving your butt up and down sort of fast will not cut it. The gluteus must almost be treated as a separate entity; consider it a limb, an arm or leg, and treat it as such. Move it independently of everything else and allow it to lead the rest of your body into the rhythm of the song.
Some take twerking seriously and others only twerk for a few laughs. No matter how you go about it, twerking has entered the public subconscious. Recently, twerking even caused a fair amount of academic outrage when it was reported that the term had been entered into the Oxford English Dictionary. Not to worry: these reports were false, but they are evidence that our current culture is enthralled by twerking.
Is our obsession with twerking an extension of the concept that “sex sells” or is it just another trend that is entertaining to sensationalize? The answer remains unclear but, in the meantime, keep twerking.

The opening lines of 2 Chainz’s new album B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time are “I had a dream … that rap wouldn’t work.” For Tauheed “2 Chainz” Epps the hip-hop lyricist, rap shouldn’t work. But his solo studio debut, 2012’s Based on a T.R.U. Story was certified Gold by the RIAA. His unforgettable ad-libs (“TRUUU”) crept into the urban lexicon, and his stunningly asinine one-liners (“She had a big booty so I call her big booty”) divided music critics and listeners alike. But 2 Chainz’s success begs the age-old question: How does rap this bad sell records?

2 Chainz goes about answering this question on Me Time the same way he did last year on Based on a T.R.U. Story — by being his usual energetic, hilarious self. There are few, if any, figures in hip hop who play the role of entertainer better than 2 Chainz. The primary concern was that 2 Chainz, like Waka Flocka Flame (Flockaveli followed by the pop-friendly, subpar Triple F Life) before him, would lose the novelty of his act after one studio album. Instead of attempting to pigeonhole his music to fit a wider demographic, 2 Chainz delivers a less inspired yet more polished clone of his studio debut on Me Time.
In an interview with MTV News, the artist formerly known as Tity Boi explained that his music was intended to serve as an escape.
“I feel like when people listen to me, they feel like they’re goin’ somewhere, taking time off; they’re relaxing, lettin’ their hair down,” 2 Chainz said.
Me Time serves that purpose quite well; those who feel burdened by the need to constantly analyze and employ mental faculties while listening to music (people like music reviewers) will certainly appreciate how little there is to think about here: Me Time is a treatise on the incredibly complex lyrical themes of having way too much money and the crippling, Prince Hamlet-esque moral quandary that comes with having to choose from too many potential sexual partners.
Those who grew accustomed to 2 Chainz’s lyrical mastery on Based on a T.R.U. Story will not go wanting on Me Time. On “Fork,” producer Mike WiLL Made It employs a menacing, ballgame-gone-ratchet organ line that glides over skittering drums and a pounding bass line. 2 Chainz is also in trademark lyrical form, bemoaning the fact that he has “so much money on [him] it won’t even fold,” and taking the time to acknowledge his household appliances (“My stove deserve a shout out / I’m like what up stove?”).
When 2 Chainz isn’t suggesting that he and a potential partner “make a sex tape and put it on Netflix” over the sparkling synths of the Fergie-featuring “Netflix,” he’s offering lessons on weight conversions on “36” (“That’s how many ounces in a briiiick”). The album’s highlights include the Shawty Redd-produced “I Do It,” where guests Lil Wayne and Drake are in fine form on the track. Wayne is especially impressive, weaving his verse into the end of Drake’s and sounding more engaged in one-and-a-half verses as a featuring artist than he has on any track off Dedication 5 or I Am Not a Human Being II.
The posse cut features the three artists attempting to outdo each other and interrupting one another’s verses over repetitive, high-pitched synths and breakneck bass drum kicks. The beat’s frenetic energy recalls Lex Luger’s work on Waka Flocka Flame’s Flockaveli, and the verses on “I Do It” match Flocka’s zest for violence bar-for-bar, with Wayne rapping “I just built a cemetery, n—-s dyyyying to get in.”
2 Chainz errs dangerously close to topical territory with the single “Feds Watching,” though any worries of a piercing lyrical analysis of NSA surveillance policies are quickly addressed when Mr. Chainz assures us that he’s “Smoking California weed with California h-es.”
Nobody seems to enjoy rapping about the same three things in a million different ways more than 2 Chainz. It’s a shame that Me Time doesn’t have the same club-banging potential of its predecessor; few of these tracks, if any, will come close to matching the impact of 2012’s “I’m Different” or “Birthday Song.”
In a bit of news that probably makes sense to no one, 2 Chainz is offering those who purchase a deluxe edition of Me Time a copy of #Mealtime, a mini-cookbook of healthy recipes developed by his tour chef, Chef Aleem. 2 Chainz, who suffers from acid reflux disease and ulcers, steers clear of red meat and pork in his diet and the recipes are for the specific foods he enjoys while on tour.
It takes a special kind of person to release a 28-page cookbook as a supplement to a rap album; then again, it would probably take the same person who got away with making people spend $15.99 on an album that contains the line “I hope you get testicular cancer in the brain.” There’s no need to worry, though — after listening through Me Time, there shouldn’t be too many brain cells left.

Though broadcast networks have almost 30 new shows debuting this fall, the most anticipated shows aren’t the ones with fresh young talent. There’s a resurgence of familiar faces this season, as older comedic actors such as Michael J. Fox and Robin Williams come back into the field and other beloved characters such as NCIS’ Ziva David and Grey’s Anatomy’s Dr. Christina Yang finish their final seasons.
With increased competition from cable networks and Netflix, major networks are changing their programming strategies. CBS is beefing up its Monday night comedy block and ABC is attempting to emulate their successful cable rivals by airing their shows in continuous twelve episode blocks and taking a long winter hiatus from December to February. Below is a mix of all-new shows and returning favorites that could make for appointment viewing:
How I Met Your Mother 
CBS, Monday, Sept. 23 at 8 p.m.
HIMYM begins its final season with the addition of new series regular Cristin Milioti as the Mother. Though the entirety of the season takes place in 56 hours during the weekend of Robin and Barney’s wedding, there will be — in typical How I Met Your Mother style — a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards. Though they won’t give away many clues, executive producers Craig Thomas and Carter Bays promise a slew of guest stars and, of course, two more slaps.
Hostages 
CBS, Monday, Sept. 23 at 10 p.m.
Toni Collette (The United States of Tara), Dylan McDermott (American Horror Story) and Tate Donovan (Damages, Argo) star in the new Jerry Bruckheimer-produced drama that centers around top Washington D.C. surgeon Ellen Sanders (Collette) who is due to operate on the president in 24 hours. The plot thickens when Sanders’ family is taken hostage by a rogue FBI agent (McDermott) who threatens their lives unless the president dies during surgery. One Tree Hill alum Hillarie Burton has booked a recurring role as an assistant to Sanders’ secretive husband (Donovan).
Castle 
ABC, Monday, Sept. 23 at 10 p.m.
The big “will-they-or-won’t-they” question plagues Castle fans once again as they anxiously await Beckett’s answer to Castle’s marriage proposal. When we last saw the couple, Beckett was contemplating a job offer in Washington D.C. Former House cast member Lisa Edelstein has also signed on for a three-episode arc as Rachel McCord, a savvy, streetwise federal investigator. Edelstein’s role leads us to believe that Beckett might just be moving to our nation’s capital for the time being. Prescreenings suggest the premiere will give an answer to the marriage question then jump ahead, and the first episode reportedly ends with a major character’s life in jeopardy.
Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
ABC, Tuesday, Sept. 24 at 8 p.m.
Directed by Joss Whedon (The Avengers, Doctor Horrible’s Sing Along Blog), this new small-screen follow-up to The Avengers and other Marvel franchise movies sees Clark Gregg reprise his role as the S.H.I.E.L.D. commanding agent, who in the wake of “The Battle of New York” is formulating an initiative team to investigate the bizarre and protect the ordinary people of the world from the extraordinary. Colbie Smulders (How I Met Your Mother) appears in the pilot, as does The Avengers’ Maria Hill.
NCIS
CBS, Tuesday, Sept. 24 at 8 p.m.
TV’s No. 1 show enters its 11th season and will be saying goodbye to beloved character Ziva David (Cote de Pablo). The first two episodes of the season will pick up where the finale left off and fill in the moments leading to the finale’s cliffhanger. This season will also address the events leading to de Pablo’s departure. Executive Producer Gary Glasberg promises Ziva David will not be leaving for good, and Micheal Weatherly said fans of Tony and Ziva will get everything they’ve been waiting for. After de Pablo’s departure, Gibbs’ team will experiment with rotating new members and a permanent new team member will reportedly be introduced sometime in January or February.
The Crazy Ones
CBS, Thursday, Sept. 26 at 9 p.m.
This new single-camera comedy stars Robin Williams and Sarah Michelle Gellar as a Chicago father-daughter advertising team. Williams plays unorthodox agency head Simon Ross, a stark contrast to his level-headed daughter. Though plot points remain somewhat unclear from show previews, executive producer Dean Lorey said, “We just feed [Williams] a few ideas, point him in a direction, sit back and enjoy.” Kelly Clarkson will appear as herself in the pilot, followed by Josh Groban in episode six.
The Michael J. Fox Show 
NBC, Thursday, September 26th at 9:30 p.m.
In a new comedy inspired by his real life, TV veteran Michael J. Fox promises to poke fun at his Parkinson’s Disease while playing a New York father and husband who returns to his job as a news anchor after five years in retirement. Candice Bergen (Murphy Brown, Miss Congeniality) and Charles Grodin (Beethoven) are on board for potentially recurring roles as Fox’s parents.
Glee
Fox, Thursday, Sept. 26 at 9 p.m.
The first episode of the season will be Beatles-themed. Then, in wake of the death of Cory Monteith, there will be a Finn tribute episode written by creator Ryan Murphy with heavy consultation from Monteith’s girlfriend and lead co-star Lea Michele. Michele’s Rachel Berry will reportedly not appear until the final act although the episode will explore how various characters deal with — or fail to deal with — Finn’s death. Heather Morris (Brittany), Mark Salling (Puck), Amber Riley (Mercedes) and Harry Shum Jr. (Mike) will not be returning to the Fox musical dramedy as series regulars this season.
Scandal 
ABC, Thursday, Oct. 3 at 10 p.m.
The buzzy political thriller returns for its third season and twitter is full of excited fans. The season opener picks up minutes after the finale and viewers will learn more about Olivia’s relationship with her father. Scott Foley was promoted to series regular which hopefully means he’ll get out of “the hole” and series creator Shonda Rhimes promises the Olivia/Fitz romance is not finished. Guest stars on tap for season three include Friends alum Lisa Kudrow and Private Practice’s Paul Adelstein, both slated for recurring roles. Kate Burton will also be reprising her role as Vice President Sally Langston.

New microparks in Los Angeles have important implications for the community. These small, green spaces provide oases from the concrete confines of the city; yet they also indicate a larger trend in the gentrification of L.A. County. Gentrification, which describes the shift in demographics when affluent people move into and modify a previously low-income area, might appear to be beneficial, but in reality, it magnifies the problem of homelessness and poverty in the county.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Councilman Jose Huizar most recently announced that Pershing Park might get a facelift. This park, located in the heart of Pershing Square, is rich in Los Angeles history.
According to the L.A. Parks website, Pershing Park, or “La Plaza Abaja,” was first dedicated in 1866; a full century and a half later, Pershing Park remains.
In its article, the Times hinted that the task force aiming to redesign the park has ulterior motives. Becky Dennison, of Community Action Network, labeled the task force as one-sided because it excluded park users, most commonly the poor, from the task force. Instead, the Times speculates that the task force will be a partnership between local businesses seeking to attract a wealthier crowd.
In addition to the Pershing Park task force’s lopsided membership, local parks are excluding the poor and homeless. Some of the newest green spaces downtown come with hefty regulations designed to discourage loitering and camping. Increased police presence, metal benches and bans on shopping carts all discourage the city’s indigent from taking up residence. Rick Coca, spokesman for Huizar, maintained that, the city “welcome[s] anybody from anywhere into any of our parks.” Instead, Skid Row activists have accused the city of intimidating the homeless, according to the Times.
On the opposite side of the spectrum, Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, D-San Francisco, and other advocates pushed for a Homeless Bill of Rights, or Assembly Bill 5, to address this injustice. The proposed bill would have granted homeless people the right to sleep, urinate, panhandle and collect recyclables in public places. Though the bill drew attention to the issue of homeless and indigent Angelenos, it neither addressed the underlying causes of homelessness nor provides a feasible solution. And even though homeless people should not be subject to undue police harassment, legalizing activities such as public sleeping and panhandling will only aggravate the problem. Condoning these activities sends the false message that it is okay to live in this manner. Focusing energy in creating long-term solutions to address the issue of homelessness is more important.
This bill had noble intentions, but it was ultimately no more realistic than the microparks’ stance on homelessness and poverty. The Assembly decided to vote against the proposed bill. As the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority’s statistics indicate, homelessness is a growing problem and these temporary fixes will not address the matter.
Furthermore, programs such as Esperanza Community’s Mercado La Paloma, which nurture locally operated small businesses, could be used as models for helping to end homelessness and poverty in Los Angeles. Mercado La Paloma manages to cater to both the interests of the new urbanites and the local residents. Similar solutions can and should be integrated into city planning in order to address the complications of gentrification.
Just as there is no single cause of homelessness or poverty, the approach to solving homelessness must be multifaceted. Unlike the previously proposed AB 5, it must include a reevaluation of services and focus on long-term solutions, not decriminalizing certain behaviors.
 
Correction: A published version of this incorrectly stated that Assembly Bill 5 was still up for vote in the Assembly. However, the bill has already been voted down. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Just can’t win with the liberals, can you? “Why are there ghettos in America? It is a travesty that businesses avoid these areas due to SHEER racism. Why aren’t the rich and eeeevil 1% doing more to address this unspeakable inequality!?” 
A year later: “Why is this unspeakable gentrification allowed to continue!? Look at the effect it is having on the homeless! The greed of corporations and the rich know no bounds! Progress…baaad. Ghettos…good.”
Ms. An should know that AB 5 is not under consideration in the Legislature, but that Mr. Ammiano does have plans to introduce another bill on decriminalization early in 2014. If the columnist would like to actually know how decriminalization works to reduce homelessness, she is welcome to contact me at Mr. Ammiano’s office. Studies from Los Angeles show that arresting people makes homelessness worse and is more costly than services. We need to stop arresting people for doing things like sleeping in public, if they have no other place to sleep.
In the end the solution for homeless people is not to provide them with either crappier parks that they can live in or better parks that they either can live in or be driven out of – but to find them housing, medical care, and jobs so that they don’t have to live in the street in the first place.  That is what people should be focusing on.  Not whether one park or another is being gentrified.

With the release of its revolutionary Galaxy Gear at an event in Berlin last Wednesday, Samsung Electronics Co. effectively began the race to conquer the evolving “smart watch” market. Though the innovative design is one of the first of its kind, Galaxy Gear has a long way to go in terms of functionality and practicality.
Alan Hung | Daily Trojan
The introduction of Galaxy Gear creates opportunities for the development of the market for wearable technology. The gadget, which wraps around users’ wrists in a typical wristwatch fashion, makes it easier than ever to stay connected while on the go and suggests that people will one day never be separated from mobile technology.
Similar to a smartphone, the Gear features a 1.63-inch touch screen interface with features such as a 1.9-megapixel camera, a built-in speaker and two microphones, allowing users to capture pictures and shoot short movies with a click of a button. The device can make phone calls and surf the web by syncing with tablets and smartphones using Google Inc.’s Android software.
According to Samsung, Galaxy Gear comes in a wide range of colors and is complete with a 4-gigabyte internal memory and 512 megabytes of RAM. The device features a fitness tracker and supposedly works with about 70 different applications, making it the “smartest” watch ever created in the opinion of many Samsung enthusiasts.
“Today, Samsung reinvents a centuries-old product,” Samsung research director Pranav Mistry said at the launch event in Berlin. “I can proudly say Galaxy Gear is a design statement, an engineering marvel and something that really redefines tomorrow.”
Despite Mistry’s confidence in Samsung’s newest creation, however, the Gear is ultimately flawed and falls very short of a smartphone replacement. For one thing, a Galaxy Gear user must own a Samsung Galaxy smartphone in order for the watch to connect to the internet via Bluetooth. Not only must a user own Samsung’s smartphone, but he must also have the smartphone with him at all times for the Gear to function properly. This dependence on a parent device limits the smart watch to existing only as a smartphone accessory, rather than a smartphone replacement.
The accompanying prices of the devices are another hindrance to the Gear’s success: The Samsung Galaxy smartphone currently markets at around $199, with the gear costing a hundred bucks more, so that’s a whopping $500 to shell out for the setup if users do not already own a Samsung Galaxy smartphone. This could certainly eliminate a large portion of Samsung’s target market if users are not willing to give up their iPhones or other smartphones in exchange for purchasing a Samsung phone.
Additionally, the design of the watch makes it rather difficult to utilize. The Gear lacks a headphone jack, forcing users to awkwardly hold the Gear to their ears when making calls and making it impossible to have a private conversation or make calls in noisy areas. Users must also charge the gadget every single day or else risk carrying around a battery-dead watch.
Samsung’s groundbreaking innovation certainly paves the way for other types of wearable mobile products, but Galaxy Gear is only the first addition to this unexplored product category. For example, Apple is rumored to be working on a similar product titled the “iWatch.” Apple’s device could have a higher degree of functionality due to its ability to seamlessly connect to other iOS devices that many potential users undoubtedly already own.
Samsung Galaxy Gear will go on sale in late September in most of the world and in the United States and Japan in October. But interested buyers should hold off on purchasing the Gear for now, until Apple and other mobile product developers release their versions of the device and prove that much more can be accomplished with the smart watch.
