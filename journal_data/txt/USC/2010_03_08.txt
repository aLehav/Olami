Usually on Tuesday afternoons, baseball starting pitcher and senior Kevin Couture would be the very last option for USC coach Chad Kreuter.

However, Couture also usually makes it through the first inning in his Sunday start. Since he didn’t last weekend, when USC faces the Pepperdine Waves today, Couture will get the rare opportunity to start consecutive games.
“We want him to go ahead and get back on the horse,” Kreuter said. “He needs to rebound and give us six strong [innings] similar to his first start [of the season].”
The Trojans (5-6) will take to the road to try to end their recent struggles, having lost five of the last seven games, including Sunday’s 16-7 blowout by New Mexico to give the Lobos the 2-1 series win.
But Sunday’s game, in which Couture pitched only two thirds of an inning, allowing seven hits and four runs, was an anomaly this season, as the starting pitching has usually kept USC close only to have the bullpen falter.
“We’ve not pitched well in spots, particularly the first couple of innings Sunday and throughout the year in the bullpen,” Kreuter said. “Our pitch selection has to be better; our location needs to improve, and our pitchers need to pitch around situations better.”
Kreuter also said that when relievers enter the game they need to either succeed or learn how to make the adjustments when they are struggling.
He noted junior Chris Mezger as a model of a pitcher that has learned from his mistakes in his first outing of the season (one-third of an inning, two hits, one run) to be productive since (seven innings, no earned runs).
The Trojans pitching staff could find reprieve in facing a Waves’            (4-7) lineup that is in a funk itself. Pepperdine is batting only .275. Instead of big boppers, the lineup features four partial or full-time starters batting at or below .200.
Joe Sever and Torrey Jacoby are the only two Waves that have produced consistently, batting .362 and .351, respectively.
USC’s bats will try to build on their last week of play. The Trojans averaged more than six runs in their four games led by Alex Sherrod’s six RBI and the play of sophomore first baseman Ricky Oropesa, who appears to be escaping his early-season struggles.
Oropesa scored seven runs last week and went 4-8 in Sunday’s doubleheader, knocking a pair of doubles and a line-drive home run that jetted out of the ballpark like a missile.
Dealing with some key injuries, Kreuter said he plans to continue to experiment with lineups in an attempt to find one that will maximize Oropesa’s production.
“When Mike Greco was hurt two days before the season started, it really changed the dynamics of the lineup,” Kreuter said. “We expected him to be a power bat that could protect Ricky in the middle of the lineup.”
In addition to Greco, Kreuter is currently without the services of his most productive hitter this season after junior infielder Matt Hart had to leave Sunday’s first game with what Kreuter described as impingement in his throwing shoulder. Hart, who had been one of Oropesa’s protectors, was evaluated by team physicians on Monday.
“I have to figure out some way to protect [Oropesa], whether that be with him leading off or batting third and us trying to stack the deck around him,” Kreuter said. “But the bottom line is that we need to pitch better. That’s the key to us winning.”
From a former Angeleno, Go SC, Go Couture! You hot baby!

With a dominant win last Friday at Oregon, the No. 12 USC women’s tennis team now returns home, ready for its rematch with the No. 9 Baylor Bears today.
The Women of Troy (8-4) have played high-quality opponents all season, and today’s dual meet will be no different. This is the fifth time in nearly three weeks that the Women of Troy will face a top-10 team.
Rematch · Junior Maria Sanchez and junior Lyndsay Kinstler were unable to top Baylor earlier this season, falling 8-4 in their match. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
The last time USC took on Baylor (9-2) was in February at the ITA National Team Indoor championships in Wisconsin, where USC fell to the Bears 5-2, but the Women of Troy will get to challenge the Bears at home again in this match.
When they competed against each other last month, the Women of Troy’s nationally ranked No. 3 singles player, junior Maria Sanchez, lost her only dual singles match of the season to Baylor’s No. 8 Lenka Broosova 2-6, 6-4, 6-1. Sanchez currently boasts a 10-1 singles record and hopes to defeat Broosova to avenge her only loss.
“The team morale is really good heading into this week. We’re all fired up to play Baylor again,” Sanchez said.
Meanwhile, Baylor is coming into the match having just beat Texas Tech 6-1 and Iowa State 7-0 last week. In addition to Broosova, Baylor has four other nationally ranked singles players: No. 41 Nina Secerbegovic, No. 53 Csilla Borsanyi, No. 82 Jelena Stanivuk and No. 98 Taylor Ormond.
Last time the two teams met, No. 21 sophomore Alison Ramos of USC was able to take down Borsanyi 7-5, 7-6, but Secerbegovic and Ormond posted wins over USC’s freshmen No. 22 Danielle Lao and No. 91 Valeria Pulido, 6-3, 6-3 and 6-4, 6-2, respectively.
In doubles, Baylor’s Broosova and Borsanyi team up as the No. 11 duo. They took down USC’s Sanchez and senior Lyndsay Kinstler 8-4 in the teams’ last meeting.
USC is 0-2 all-time against Baylor, falling 4-3 to the Bears in 2006 at Marks Stadium.
USC’s lineup for the match has not yet been determined. The match will start at 1:30 p.m. at Marks Stadium.

The countdown has officially begun.
Spring break is just days away, and many students have already mentally checked out of class and checked into vacation mode.
Whether you’re heading on a cruise to Ensenada, Mexico, or simply lounging around Los Angeles next week, remember one thing: Most spring athletes aren’t getting a break.
That’s right. The majority of athletes will still be practicing on a daily basis and putting their skills to the test against opponents next week.
Although athletes, like all other students, probably deserve a week completely away from class and work (in this case, the field, court or track), it’s an impossible task to accomplish because universities don’t share the same spring break schedules.
But just because athletes won’t be getting the spring break we all know and love doesn’t necessarily mean they will be stuck in Los Angeles.
As always, being an athlete has an upside.
Remember, half of athletes’ games and performances take place on the road, and this is no different during spring break. In fact, many USC teams are traveling away from Southern California next week, and some are headed to some pretty exciting places around the country.
So without further delay, here is my top-three list for travel destinations for USC athletes next week.
At the top is Hawaii, where the baseball and women’s water polo teams will be headed. After all, who wouldn’t like to be in Hawaii for spring break?
Yes, both teams will be headed to Honolulu, and, when they’re not competing in the most tropical state in the country, I’m sure many of the athletes will find time to lie out on the sand, surf, parasail or attend a luau, among other festivities.
Sounds pretty fun to me.
If I were a member of either of those teams, I wouldn’t be feeling too bad about having to travel with my team for spring break.
Coming in second place would be Las Vegas. Those partiers on the men’s golf team will be participating in the Southern Highlands Collegiate this weekend.
I think just about everyone would agree that whether you’re in Vegas for work, sports or just vacation time, you’re going to find a way to have fun. Something as simple as walking down the strip on a Friday evening in Vegas could end up being filled with an endless night of laughter and memories.
Well, laughter and blurry memories, at least.
Just like in Hawaii, a weekend in Vegas sounds like a pretty great way to spend spring break. The only reason it doesn’t top Hawaii on my list is because, if you’re attending USC and of age, you could drive to Vegas just about any weekend you want and enjoy everything Sin City has to offer.
After these top-two destinations, there’s a bit of a drop off, but I feel pretty confident in my third and final pick.
Rounding out the top three on my list would have to be Durham, N.C. The men’s tennis team is headed to take on Duke.
Although some might not understand this pick, I’ve heard absolutely great things about Durham. It’s a college town that has a fun nightlife, great music, and it’s only a few hours away from Atlanta or Washington, D.C. So there are other options if it ends up not living up to its potential. It’s just a couple hours away from the beaches and mountains as well.
So it provides many possibilities for fun and entertainment, weather permitting, and that’s why Durham squeezes into my top three, just ahead of Houston (sorry women’s swimming and diving team).
After seeing those destinations, you’re probably thinking that being an athlete during spring break isn’t so bad after all.
But it must be noted that some athletes will be stuck in Los Angeles next week, and others will be traveling to some not-so-thrilling places in the country (say hello to Provo, Utah, men’s volleyball team).
Either way, the bottom line is athletes still have work to do during spring break while the rest of us can simply relax for the most part.
It’s just that some athletes get to work in better places than others.

Inglewood, Calif., has always been a tale of two worlds. When the Los Angeles Lakers played at the Great Western Forum, the city was known for its lavish basketball arena. Many people who came to the arena, however, failed to realize that a significant number of Inglewood residents struggled to pay for necessities, with Lakers tickets being completely out of reach.

Now that former USC defensive end Lawrence Jackson is in the NFL, he is using his platform as a professional athlete to improve the conditions in his hometown.
“After living in both of those worlds, I want people to know what is really going on,” Jackson said in an interview at Heritage Hall. “I have seen hell and I have seen heaven, and I want to help make the whole situation paradise.”
Growing up, Jackson had friends that died or went to jail because of drugs or violence. In order to stay out of trouble, he had to make tough choices to avoid the pitfalls his friends fell into.
“There is no other city that could have produced me the way that I am today than Inglewood,” Jackson said. “Growing up in a situation like that taught me independence. The only way that I can explain it is like being a lion cub in a safari. When you are with your parents, it is cool, but when you are alone the hyenas can come get you.”
Playing football kept Jackson out of harm’s way after school. He had a decorated prep career at Inglewood High School before enrolling at USC. In college, Jackson redshirted his first year before becoming a four-year starter. He led the Trojans with 10.5 sacks as a senior and was drafted in the first round of the 2008 NFL draft by the Seattle Seahawks.
As a rookie, Jackson had 29 tackles and two sacks for the Seahawks. Last season, he had 32 tackles, 4.5 sacks and two forced fumbles.
“I think the transition was eased a little bit because of the publicity we had at this school,” Jackson said about going from USC to the NFL. “Being exposed to the circus early on and having [USC Sports Information Directors] Tim [Tessalone] and Paul [Goldberg] there to guide us really prepared us. Athletically, the transition was easier than for most because of the level of competition we had.”
Jackson also recognizes how important the skill level of those around him during his time at USC helped him prepare for his career in the NFL.
“[Mark Sanchez] was the quarterback we went against in scrimmages, so he got better, but we also got better,” Jackson said. “I am thankful that I was around the players I was around.”
Now that Pete Carroll has left USC to become the head coach of the Seahawks, Jackson will be reunited with his college mentor.
“Knowing what the [Seahawks] organization was all about internally and seeing it from that perspective, I felt that there was a good chance [Carroll] would come up because you could not turn down the offer that he had,” Jackson said. “The good thing for me is that I am experienced. [The new Seahawks coaching staff knows] who I am as a player.”
Jackson also knows that the new coaching staff has seen his maturation over the course of his career.
“I get to use the five years that I was coached [at USC] and the two years I was coached in the [National Football] League, and take all of that and move forward in this next decade,” Jackson said. “I have my chance to leave my mark on the NFL.”
Another one of Jackson’s former coaches at USC, Lane Kiffin, is now the university’s head football coach.
“I am not worried about it at all,” Jackson said about the hiring of Kiffin. “This was the best hire they could have made, in terms of having somebody from the program that helped build it and took the beatings of the real world and came back with that experience. I think he will do a great job.”
In the NFL offseason, Jackson enjoys coming back to USC and talking to the younger players.
“I received a lot of knowledge from the older guys,” Jackson said. “Me being who I am, independent of the football persona, and staying true to that, I remind the younger guys of little things that other athletes might not be telling them, so to see them go off and be successful is huge.”
When he is not training for football, Jackson enjoys photography. In addition, Jackson is working on a book that will document how he overcame obstacles living in Inglewood.
“I want to be a catalyst for change,” Jackson said. “I want to shift the paradigm on athletes. I want my voice to be heard because I have been blessed with a unique perspective on things, and I have experienced a lot personally that a lot of people don’t know.”

The USC men’s volleyball team is winning again.
And boy does it feel good.
Big performance · Junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy tied for the Trojans lead in both kills (16) and service aces (five) against Hawai’i last night at the Galen Center. USC has now won two straight matches. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
“We’re starting to play a little bit. We’re looser out there and starting to have fun,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “We got our mojo back, as one of my assistants said.”
For the first time since Jan. 22, when USC was 10-2 and No. 1 in the nation, the No. 7 Trojans won back-to-back games, as they avenged an earlier season loss to No. 8 Hawai’i 3-1 (16-30, 30-22, 30-19, 30-23).
“This is exactly what we needed,” junior setter Riley McKibbin said. “It feels good. We’re finally starting to click.”
The Trojans were led by a balanced passing attack from Riley McKibbin and his younger brother Maddison McKibbin. They kept the Warriors off balance all night, as three players had more than 20 kill attempts, not including both middle blockers, sophomore Steve Shandrick and senior Hunter Current, who had 16 attempts each.
“When we pass well, I can run the offense,” Riley McKibbin said. “We have some of the best attackers in the league. It’s just about being able to run the system. I’ve been focusing on running the middle a little more, and it worked out real well for us.”
It looked like the Trojans might be in for a long night after the first set. For the eighth time in their last nine matches, the Trojans lost the opening set.
The Warriors outplayed the Trojans in almost every aspect, outhitting them .473 to .081 and winning 94 percent of their sideout points, compared to just 51 percent for USC. Ferguson put in three substitutes in late in the set, but more to get them playing experience and give McKibbin and the middle blockers rest so they could be ready to start the second set.
“We were out of timeouts, so I just wanted to get them ready and gear up for the next three sets,” Ferguson said.
And what did he tell them after the usual first set loss?
“I told the team we had them right where we wanted them.”
After that first set, the match flipped on its head. It seemed USC could do nothing wrong. The attackers varied the offense with floaters over the top of the blockers and kills around the side of the blocking wall. The Warriors had no answers for the Trojans’ attack, as USC ended up with a .357 hitting percentage.
USC turned up the defensive pressure as well. After recording only one block in the first set, the Trojans finished with 15.
“We’ve been blocking better in the last two months, it’s just been overshadowed by some of the losses,” Ferguson said. “I thought our guys did the best job of executing the game plan tonight and our serving was much better, making it more unpredictable.”
Unlike in the match against UC Santa Barbara, USC built big leads early in the last three sets and didn’t let up. They jumped out to 16-9 leads in both the second and third sets and an early 4-0 lead in the fourth set.
“We saw they were flustered, so we knew if we kept playing consistent they would crumble,” Riley McKibbin said.
The Trojans hope they can repeat their performance tonight when they host Hawai’i again at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.

The City of Los Angeles may be shaving $2 million off its annual budget by terminating the department that oversees the neighborhood council networks.
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa plans to move the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment to the Community Development Department, which oversees grant funds. According to the Los Angeles Times this merger would eliminate 27 jobs, but put the neighborhood councils into a “more efficient agency.”
This merger is one of several in an effort to eliminate a $484 million gap starting July 1. Other departments, including the Environmental Affairs and Human Services are also being merged into other city departments.
“This could be a tremendous evolution of the sytem,” Al Abrams, a member of the city commission that oversees the neighborhood councils, told the L.A. Times.
He said he believes it is a good idea to put the neighborhood councils in an agency that works closely with non-profits, but the city might lack support from upcoming neighborhood council elections.
The article in the Los Angeles Times stated that this plan may bring challenges from backers of the neighborhood councils.
Head of neighborhood council BongHwan Kim said he will resign by June 30, and Richard Benbow will run the newly named Department of Community Development and Neighborhood Empowerment.

If you’ve ever suffered through one of MTV’s raucous spring break specials, you might conclude that all college students make a yearly pilgrimage to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, where they jiggle around in too-small bikinis and lick whipped cream off of strangers’ bodies.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
For throngs of young adults, spring break has become regrettably synonymous with sun, José Cuervo and the occasional sexually transmitted disease. Many students at USC, however, are breaking the stereotypical mold of a college spring break. They are investing in their own lives and the lives of others by volunteering during their vacation.
Whether traveling abroad to provide clean water for families in Honduras or simply lending some time to a local beach cleanup, USC students who volunteer have the unique opportunity to gain personal, professional and physical benefits that will last far beyond the end of the week.
College students should capitalize on volunteer positions, as volunteers often feel an increased sense of purpose after making a positive impact on the community they have served. Alyssa Odle, a senior majoring in public relations, will return to Australia this spring break for a second trip as a missionary with Campus Crusade for Christ.
Although the group’s main objective is to share the message of Christian faith and benefit the lives of college students in Melbourne, Australia, volunteers often find that their own lives are transformed in the process. These students agreed that serving in Australia gives them an increased sense of purpose as well as joy in their lives.
“I will come back more deeply in love with God, with a stronger tie to Australia [and] with more motivation to serve missionally in the future,” Odle said. “I have the knowledge that I was instrumental in changing hearts and lives for eternity.”
In addition to the relatively intangible emotional benefits that volunteers achieve — such as a renewed work ethic and a sense of compassion ­— from supporting those in need, student workers can even use volunteer experiences to further their career goals.
A precisely chosen service project can also boost a résumé and develop skills that students will need on the job. For Matt Tan, a junior majoring in biological sciences, the time spent providing medicine and health education to villagers in Honduras during his 2009 spring break ignited his desire to gain a better understanding of the individuals he will someday treat.
“Part of being a good doctor is getting experience and learning about different cultures so that in the future I can relate to my patients,” said Tan, who is the co-vice president of USC’s Global Water Brigades and helped organize another trip to Honduras for this year’s spring break.
This year the student workers will introduce a sanitary drinking water system for a village of about 120 families. Students on the trip will also spend time with local leaders in an effort  to encourage sustainability and healthy lifestyles in their own communities.
Some would-be volunteers argue that, although these community service projects are valuable and certainly admirable, spring break is reserved strictly for relaxation. They assert that all students need the time to clear their heads and should enjoy a week that is devoid of all responsibilities.
However, increasing amounts of medical research proves that volunteer work actually helps students relax and revitalize themselves for the final weeks of the semester.
Scientists from The Corporation for National and Community Service presented their findings in a report entitled “The Health Benefits of Volunteering,” indicating a relationship between community service and overall physical wellness.
Even three years after completing a significant volunteer project, those who served the community reported higher levels of happiness, self-esteem and a sense of control over their lives than non-volunteers. Other positive effects include evidence that volunteers experience lower rates of depression and live longer than their peers who do not volunteer, even when taking into account such factors as age, socioeconomic status and gender.
Overall, individuals who partake in volunteer projects can not only solve problems for communities in need but can also transform their own lives in the process. When making plans for spring break 2010, USC students would do well to commit their time and skills as a volunteer.
A diverse range of projects need support in Los Angeles as well as abroad. This need allows students to pursue their passions — whether they are leading a youth reading group or supporting individuals affected by HIV/AIDS in Africa. Each of these contributions is inherently valuable, since the seemingly small efforts of a team of purposeful individuals can make an impact far greater than the sum of their parts.

Don’t talk to strangers.
It’s a message instilled in us by our parents time and time again as the cardinal rule of safety. We listened carefully as children, mainly because this piece of advice was necessary for our everyday safety.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
However, for today’s college students and younger generations growing up in the age of technology, people are finding the rule harder to comply with. As digital interaction furiously expands, the Internet has completely changed the dynamic for this outdated, cautionary childhood lesson.
We might not talk to strangers in person, but it’s a different story in the virtual world.
But what’s so exciting about sharing computer screen time with a stranger?
Through the World Wide Web’s plethora of social media networks, forums, chat rooms, dating sites and online communities, communication among strangers has not just become a tool for business but a popular form of entertainment.
The thrill-seeking and fun is made possible through the Internet’s many unregulated platforms — a communicative free-for-all allowing online acquaintances to share all types of information, including messages of explicit content.
Coming off the heels of successful talkback sites like Twitter is a new craze with its own twist on online communication: Chatroulette. For those who have yet to discover this new addiction, Chatroulette is a website that pairs random strangers throughout the world for conversations via users’ webcams.
It’s an Internet creeper’s dream.
Following in the footsteps of the young minds behind social media giants like MySpace and Facebook, a 17-year-old Russian high school student launched Chatroulette in November of last year. The site somehow caught the eyes of the New York Times and Good Morning America, and since then Chatroulette has brought strangers together from all over the world via webcam.
Chatroulette’s increasing buzz is unusual: Most would agree that the unassuming masses are not really that interesting. Yet, in a single day, Chatroulette registers about half a million visitors with about 50,000 people chatting away at any given time.
Though services like Skype allow you to video chat with friends and loved ones, Chatroulette instead tests the public’s curiosity of the unknown.
Wondering why people used this voyeuristic talk service, I embarked on a series of conversations with happenstance chat mates encountering a wide variety of people on the Chatroulette spectrum.
Amused by the unpredictability of it all, a curly-haired, wide-eyed girl with Hello Kitty posters on her wall loves “seeing what people will do.” It appears some users log on to Chatroulette to observe people in their personal habitats and everyday spaces.
There are other reasons too. Looking to broaden his social scene, a balding middle-aged man in Kansas called Chatroulette “a community to meet people.” Though companionship might not always be an eventual goal, it’s not uncommon to find yourself talking to a complete stranger for several minutes without realizing the time has gone by. In this sense, Chatroulette offers a virtual place for conversations you already strike up with strangers in your day-to-day activities, at a coffee shop, airport or store.
Chatroulette is no stranger to controversy, as any conversation has the potential to dangerously transform into a risqué video chat, as evidenced by the countless number of shirtless young men and crude images that you would rather not see. In these cases, the reason for thrill is evident.
Celebrities have even started to jump on the trend. Paris Hilton, Jessica Alba and Nicole Richie are just some of the starlets that have taken a break from Tweeting and moved on to webcam communication.
Seeking the creator’s original intent for Chatroulette, a woman sitting with her baby in Taiwan said she just wants “good conversation.”
It’s not hard to see why college students are infatuated with the novelty of a site like this. As natural consumers of technology, communication through Chatroulette doesn’t seem the least bit daunting. Whereas other audiences might reject emerging forms of digital media, college students have adopted and embraced each one. With texting, instant messaging and Skype as the predecessors, Chatroulette falls nicely in line.
Finally, a student pops up on my screen— a fact that’s evidenced by the books, bowls of cereal and homework material surrounding him.
What’s the real reason we love Chatroulette?
It helps us procrastinate.

As a response to the failed Christmas Day bombing on a plane bound for Detroit, many airports, including LAX, are installing body-scanning machines.
Though the scanners already exist in some airport, the Christmas day incident has caused a rise in their demand; body scanning technology could be a part of every airport security system by 2011. LAX is among nine airports nationwide receiving the technology.
Many airport patrons agree that the equipment is a necessary advance in defense against terrorism, but the introduction of this technology brings with it a very obvious compromise: security personnel essentially see the passenger naked.
The scanners have already provoked controversy over privacy violations. A person selected at random to pass through the scanner cannot refuse. Recently two Muslim women who refused the scan for religious and medical reasons were turned away from UK’s Manchester Airport.
In some airports, though, passengers may opt for screening by metal detector and by hand rather than undergo the body imaging scan.
In recognition of the discomfort that the body scanners have caused with the public, airport security, regardless of location, are promising that the images will be immediately deleted after the passenger is cleared.
The other California airports scheduled to receive scanners are San Diego International, Oakland International and Mineta San José International.

Sunday’s series finale became a battle of the bullpens in the first inning.
New Mexico’s relievers were up to the task, but USC’s were not. And the Lobos took advantage, beating the Trojans 16-7 to split the doubleheader and take the series, two games to one.
The rubber game between USC (5-6) and New Mexico seemed destined to be a shootout when the Lobos scored four in the top of the first, chasing USC senior starter Kevin Couture after just two-thirds of an inning.
The Trojans responded with six in the bottom of the first, roughing up New Mexico starter Mike Lachapelle. He also left after just two-thirds of an inning.
But Richard Olson came on for the Lobos and dazzled, throwing four and one-third innings of shutout baseball. That allowed his team’s bats to score 12 runs off of six USC relievers.
Most of the damage was done off of sophomore Jordan Hershiser (five runs allowed) and junior Brett Williams (five runs).
Justin Howard continued to be a thorn in the Trojans’ side, going 5-6 with two doubles, three runs scored and 5 RBIs. Every New Mexico starter had at least one hit, and eight of the nine starters scored at least one run.
USC had its chances after the first inning, putting at least one man on in every inning except the ninth. But Olson and two relievers kept the Trojans off the board until the eighth, when Keith Castillo’s home run to center field made it 16-7.
New Mexico finished with 16 runs on 20 hits, while the Trojans scored seven runs on 14 hits.
The Lobos’ game three drubbing came after the Trojans took the first game of the doubleheader, 6-2, with timely hitting and solid pitching.
Sophomore Ben Mount continued to shine, picking up the victory with five and two-thirds innings of two-run ball. He allowed just six hits and two walks, and only one of the runs was earned.
Junior Chris Mezger and sophomore Chad Smith combined to throw three and one-third shutout innings in relief.
Sophomore Ricky Oropesa scored three of USC’s six runs and seemed to break out of an early-season funk on Sunday. He went 3-5 with a two-run home run, a double and a stolen base in the first game Sunday to lead USC.
He moved from third in the lineup to the leadoff spot in the second game and went 2-5 with a double, a run scored and one RBI in improving his average to .262.
Sunday’s doubleheader was necessary after Saturday’s game was washed out by rain. The day off came after the Trojans suffered a difficult defeat in Friday’s series opener.
Redshirt sophomore Andrew Triggs was brilliant in the opener, pitching into the eighth inning and striking out a career-high nine batters. But Triggs allowed two runs in the eighth and junior reliever Ryan Cabral allowed the eventual winning run in the top of the ninth.
The Trojans broke through in the first inning Friday when sophomore Alex Sherrod delivered a two-run single to make it 2-0 early. USC sent seven men to the plate in that first inning against New Mexico starter Rudy Jaramllio, and it seemed as if they would hit him hard.
But Jaramillo settled down and shut the Trojans out the rest of the way, allowing just two hits over the next seven innings. He didn’t dazzle, striking out just one batter, but he did enough to pick up the victory.
Edwin Carl came on in the ninth and set the Trojans down in order to preserve the one-run victory.
USC now enters arguably the toughest stretch of its entire schedule. The Trojans travel to Pepperdine Tuesday, and they will play just two of their next 14 games at home.
Their only home games in that stretch are Wednesday against Connecticut and Tuesday, March 23, against the Waves.
USC has a four-game series against at Hawai’i, a three-game series at Pacific and a three-game series at Stanford in that stretch.
The Trojans will open their Pac-10 home schedule April 1st against Oregon State.
