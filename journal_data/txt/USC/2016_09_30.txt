Now that I am comfortably back on my couch and not experiencing level five road rage during my commute from work in West Hollywood to Downtown, let’s all take a deep inhale and a sip of our tea. 
This week saw me in crisis mode. From preparing for three midterms I had this week to contemplating a total career change, let’s just say I will most definitely be sippin’ on something this Saturday at the game to congratulate myself for making it through yet another stressful week of my senior year at USC. And although I was running around like a chicken with her head cut off (no Chick-fil-A), when I sat down to write this article I found myself with little to say. 
Rather than bore you with how to’s about successful studying, I figured being six weeks into my blog some of you are probably still Urban Dictionary-ing some of the words I use to no avail. 
So, if you want to stop being a Plain Jane, here’s your chance. 
Peepin’ or Creepin’ (verb)
Origin: Probably the OG of the coined phrases. We’ve all shamelessly helped a friend stalk a new crush on social media, looked at a passerby for a couple seconds too long just to determine if their outfit was cute or not, or have had an uncomfortable experience where you got stared down in the street. 
Used in a sentence: “You are slaying tonight girl! Everyone is looking at you.” 
“Peepin’ or creepin’ though?”
Too Turnt Tina  (noun)  
Origin: A person that has had too much to drink and is then subsequently lost in the sauce. Also known as a spaghetti/limp noodle friend. Not affiliated with Tina from Bob’s Burgers. 
Used in a sentence: “I have an 8:00 AM tomorrow, so I’m not trying to be a Too Turnt Tina tonight.” 
We Peaceful (adjective) 
Origin: We’ve all had an experience when someone did us dirty, but we chose to take the high road. This phrase is used to describe a state of mind in which one is at ease about something or simply gives no F***s.  
Used in a sentence: “I noticed a girl at the club wearing the same dress as me, but we peaceful. We all know who wore it better.” 
Getting Your Shmoney/Coins/Checks Up (verb)   
Origin: Inspired by the one and only Miss Cardi B of Love and Hip Hop New York. The act of getting your “shmoney” (i.e. money, dollars, coins, checks) up is when you are on your grind at work trying to glow up rather than focusing on nonsense. 
Used in a sentence: “I worked two jobs over the summer trying to get my shmoney up.” 
Printer Paper Chick  (noun, adjective)   
Origin: Someone who has no spice to them whatsoever. They are as boring as an unseasoned piece of chicken. If you know a girl who has no personality, no sense of style, and probably can’t hold a conversation unless it’s about SoulCycle, Cartier bracelets, or how she plans to sell tea on Instagram as a career, then you have a printer paper chick in your midst. 
Used in a sentence: “All Sally listens to is Top 40. She’s a printer paper chick for sure. Not lit!” 
 
Honestly, I should consider writing my own version of Webster’s Dictionary because the amount of words and phrases I’ve coined could fill a book. 
Also, I’d like to add a shameless plug to my two cousins, Lux, who just put out their newest mixtape, Hightide II, on SoundCloud. Talk about a way with words. I expect to hear tailgate speakers boomin’ this weekend. Everyone go peep it!

USC Trustee and alum Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne have donated $20 million toward the foundation of the Lawrence J. Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine of USC, according to USC News.
The facility, founded earlier this year by a $200 million donation from Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, will focus on the holistic prevention of cancer through interdisciplinary research.
Marc Benioff is the chairman and CEO of Salesforce, a cloud computing company based in San Francisco. Benioff has also been a member of the USC Board of Trustees since 2010. According the press release, he is credited with creating the “1-1-1 model of philanthropy, donating 1 percent of Salesforce’s equity, employee time and product to nonprofits and educational institutions to improve communities around the world.”
“Marc and Lynne Benioff stand among our nation’s most visionary philanthropists, and their extraordinary gift invests in USC’s commitment to new technologies and research that fight cancer,” USC President C. L. Max Nikias said in the press release. “Their gift also ensures that our University will remain at the fore of this field, and continue to bring hope and resolve to the fight.  We should all applaud the Benioffs’ dedication to our collective fight against cancer.”
The donation was made in honor of Benioff’s father, Russell Benioff, who passed away from cancer. The lobby of the building will be named after the late Benioff.

Visiting professors Amir Sharifi and Asli Ü Bâli discussed the relationship between the Turkish state and its Kurdish minority population at the Annenberg School for Communication on Thursday evening.
Adriana Shen | Daily Trojan An ongoing conflict · Amir Sharifi, director of the Kurdish Human Rights Advocacy Group, spoke on the need for changes at the local level in Turkey.
The discussion, hosted by the USC Middle East Studies Program and moderated by Evîn Cheikosman, a M.A. candidate in the USC Center on Public Diplomacy, was an opportunity for the crowd in attendance to reinforce their knowledge on the complicated social and political relationships between the Turkish state and Kurds, from their first butting of heads after World War I  to today.
Sharifi is the director of the Kurdish Human Rights Advocacy Group, president of the Kurdish American Education Society and lecturer of linguistics at California State University, Long Beach. Bâli is a professor of law at the UCLA School of Law who teaches public international law, international human rights and a seminar on the laws of war.
The Kurdish people are an ethnic group from the Mesopotamian Plains, an area that encompasses parts of many Middle-Eastern nations, such as south-eastern Turkey, north-eastern Syria, northern Iraq, north-western Iran and south-western Armenia.
Despite their dispersal between these nations, the Kurds share a common language and culture that transcends man-made borders. This has led many Kurds, beginning in the 20th century, to advocate for the establishment of an independent Kurdish state, putting them at direct odds with the newly formed Turkish state after World War I.
“At the founding of the Turkish state, there was absolutely no recognition of such a thing as a Kurdish community,” Bâli said. “In fact to this day you will hear Turkish nationalists recite the same narrative that was present at that time at the founding that there is no such thing as a Kurdish population, there is only Mountain Kurds, [a derogatory term].”
Today, Kurds make up 20 percent of Turkey’s population, but despite this, only just managed to gain any sort of representation in the government in the form of the People’s Democratic Party (HDP), a left-wing, progressive and pro-Kurdish party. However, this movement has taken a step back following the recent coup attempt in Turkey this past July.
“You see the Turkish government opportunistically using the purges to simply lump in anybody who is politically aligned with a pro-Kurdish position,” Bâli said. “Most recently and most prominently, of course, with the removal of 24 elected mayors in the Southeastern provinces of Turkey from their office and their detainship [sic] and prosecution, allegedly as part of some sort of terrorist conspiracy.”
Sharifi, himself a diasporic Kurd from Iran, believes that while Kurds in areas like Turkey have a long way to go before they are free of persecution and that changes needs to occur in local municipalities, rather than broad sweeping change at the national level.
“Democracy is to be institutionalized, if you mention I think, for instance in Turkey, the HDP played such a significant role through the municipalities,” Shafri said. “And I think this is something historic about the Kurds. Through these communal formations of political and civil representations, they can primarily have a popular participatory mechanism whereby they would be exercising their right to self-assertion and right to self-determination.”
Despite the long-held animosity between Turkey and its Kurdish citizens, Bâli believes that there is hope for a progressive future in Turkey that fosters greater cooperation between the two groups.
“An interesting phenomenon that we’ve seen over the last decade is the emergence of a Kurdish voice in Turkey that isn’t just a voice about ethnic identitarian concerns, but about a political formation,” Bâli said. “[It is] a progressive platform that encompasses many more things — LGBT communities, gender equality, environmental protections — [which] many Turks … disgusted with the mainstream existing political formations might be prepared to sign up for.”

Relations between the United States and China have been a major part of the 2016 presidential election, from confrontations in the South China Sea to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s ceaseless denouncements of China’s trade policies. On Thursday, the U.S.-China Institute hosted “The China Card: Politics Vs. Policy,” a day-long conference at the Radisson Hotel which focused on examining the impact of China on U.S. politics.
USC’s U.S.-China Institute, part of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, seeks to provide insights into the relationship between these two global powers to stimulate public discourse through research, education and events. Topics at the conference included the 2016 election, notably the demographics who are likely to support Trump and his protectionist policies, as well as the environment, global business, law and human rights and defense.
The event brought together leaders from across the country, including former diplomats, scholars from the East Coast and abroad and the first Chinese-American woman in the United States to be elected mayor of any city, Lily Lee Chen of Monterey Park, California.
The first panel included Jonathan Rothwell, senior economist at Gallup, who discussed some of the characteristics of Trump’s voter base. According to polling data collected by Rothwell and Gallup, voters are more likely to support Trump if they are located in areas that are less exposed to foreign trade. This may imply that in regions which are well-connected to international commerce, such as Southern California, people are more likely to consider the benefits of trading with China rather than potential downsides.
“The China Card: Politics Vs. Policy” commemorated the 10th anniversary of the U.S.-China Institute, which was originally founded by then-Provost C.L. Max Nikias in 2006.
Also in the first panel was Dornsife professor of political science, who spoke about the possibility of achieving free trade policies during the next presidential administration.
“Freer trade is going to be tough, and it’s going to be tough for years to come because of what’s happened in both parties,” said Shrum, who noted Trump’s move toward protectionist policies as being uncharacteristic of typical Republican candidates. “This is what I’m confident of: China has been a recurring issue in our campaigns, for good and for bad. It’s an issue now and it will be again.”
Phoebe Mengxiao Tang, a Ph.D. candidate in political science and international relations, said that she enjoyed hearing about China from very different perspectives.
“It’s very beneficial to hear content and discourse from different angles related to China and China’s relationships,” Tang said. “Some of [the speakers] even traced back the history of China, and how China traditionally has viewed the world and how it places itself in the world, which I find very interesting.”
Clayton Dube, executive director of the U.S.-China Institute, spoke about the media and the research it produces for the public.
“We have one job: to inform public discussion about how the relationship is evolving and why it matters,” Dube said. “We produce documentary films … which more than 50 million people have seen. We also produce two magazines, and we train with secondary school teachers to do a better job teaching about China.”
Dube also noted the U.S.-China Institute’s cross-disciplinary nature, citing that it collaborates with various schools within USC to examine the relationship of the two countries in depth.

While many opportunities exist for medical students to gain experience in their field at USC, one organization active in Latin America and Africa has opened its doors to the entire student body.
Photo courtesy of Oscar Chen Going global · USC Medlife President Oscar Chen traveled to Peru in January to deliver healthcare services and educate local people.
USC Medlife sends students abroad to provide healthcare to the local residents in developing countries. Members of the organization have attended mobile clinics in Lima, Peru and Riobamba, Ecuador this past year. This winter, the organization will conduct its first clinic in Managua, Nicaragua, according to USC Medlife President Oscar Chen.
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Chen said that Medlife’s mission is driven by its belief in the universal nature of healthcare.
“Medlife is dedicated to providing care to medically underserved communities because it is morally wrong to deny any individual to access to healthcare,” Chen wrote.
According to Chen, students who participate in the trip assist in setting up mobile clinics in the local communities and shadow different stations, including triage, doctor, dentist, OB/GYN, tooth brushing and pharmacy. They also educate the community about disease prevention, including lessons on how to administer self-examinations for breast lumps that could potentially lead to breast cancer.
Students of any year or major can join Medlife by submitting an application online. After attending their first trip, students become members of the USC chapter. Each trip with Medlife lasts from one to two weeks, and each mobile clinic lasts one week. On average, approximately 20 to 25 USC students participate in each trip, joining students from other universities to create a total staff of 60 to 100 students.
All the expenses for Medlife trips are covered by participation fees and donations. Students are required to pay a participation fee that ranges from between $600 to $800 depending on the location of the trip, which includes housing, food, transportation for a week and the equipment and staff needed.
Local healthcare professionals assist Medlife with each trip. According to Chen, these health professionals work in a hospital for 10 to 11 months during the year, and volunteer for one or two months at the mobile clinics. He believes that along with the help of the local healthcare providers, the cultural barrier between visiting students and local people can be decreased, as they can relate to the community and communicate with the patients in the local language.
“This is a very important aspect of Medlife because these health professionals have a greater understanding of the sociopolitical factors that contribute to inadequate healthcare in the communities that they serve,” Chen wrote. “The healthcare professionals that we work with also speak English, so students are encouraged to ask questions and learn from their experiences.”
Medlife has also created development projects that focus on bringing sustainable changes to the local community. Students involve themselves in construction while they are abroad, and help fundraise for specific projects when they return from the trip.
“One of the biggest issues with organizations that help these impoverished communities is what happens when they leave due to limited resources,” Chen wrote. “Are the communities able to adopt a healthier lifestyle or will they revert back to their original state? Medlife creates sustainable projects like staircases and water delivery systems that have lasting impacts on the community.”
Claire Justin, a junior majoring in non-governmental organizations and social change and global health, joined Medlife to gain a better understanding of how medicine is practiced in an underserved population in a low-income country. She said that her first trip to Peru in the winter of 2015 allowed her to feel more closely connected with her global health goals.
“Not only did I get to see and participate in the wonderful humanitarian work that Medlife is doing in Peru, [but] I also learned about the specific challenges that the working poor in Peru face,” Justin said. “Being in Peru opened my eyes to the realities that people in low-income countries face when it comes to trying to get health care. The whole experience showed me that the global community can have a real and lasting impact on their lives.”
Medlife focuses on providing healthcare not only to those in developing countries but also to the local community. According to Chen, when students are not volunteering in mobile clinics, they have opportunities to serve the underserved people around the city of Los Angeles.
“One of the key philosophies of Medlife is that we aim to provide care to people that suffer from inadequate access,” Chen wrote. “This included volunteering abroad in third world countries but also in the United States itself. We shape our members into active members in the fight against healthcare disparities in the hopes of improving the lives of countless people around the world.”
Kathleen Tor, a senior majoring in biological sciences, said that the trip gave her insight to the delivery of healthcare outside of the United States.
“Medlife has definitely changed the way I view the world,” Tor said. “I have since developed a new appreciation for things I had previously taken for granted, such as clean water and access to health care facilities. Medlife opened my eyes to global issues with which I had not previously concerned myself.”
