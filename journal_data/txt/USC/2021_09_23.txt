Freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart tore his meniscus during his debut against Washington State Saturday and underwent minor surgery, according to a USCFootball report. Dart will be out for an extended period of time. 
Near the end of the first half against Washington State, Dart appeared injured but stayed in the game. He began the second half with a brace on his knee and a slight limp. 
By the end of the game, the 6-foot-3 quarterback threw 391 yards — the most ever in a USC quarterback’s debut — and four touchdowns. 
After the game, redshirt senior center Brett Nielon said Dart reminded him of former USC quarterback Sam Darnold, who led USC to its last bowl victory.
The freshman was held out of practice this week for “precautionary reasons,” said interim head coach Donte Williams during USC’s radio show “Trojans Live” Monday. Williams did not provide an update on Dart’s status Thursday during a press conference.
“It’s not really a mystery,” Williams said. “We’re just making sure we protect Jaxson from Jaxson.”
Dart’s debut performance led many to speculate the possibility of a quarterback competition between Dart and long-time starter junior Kedon Slovis. Now, with Dart out for seemingly the rest of the season, Slovis will be under center.
However, Slovis is also dealing with his own issues. He exited the Washington State game with a neck injury and his status is still unclear.
“Right now, we have Kedon and Miller [Moss] that practiced yesterday,” said Williams Thursday. “And I’m happy to talk about those guys. And we’ll see the quarterback situation Saturday in the game.”
The Trojans will face Oregon State Saturday at the Coliseum.

USC lost in four sets in its first Pac-12 matchup of the season against UCLA at Pauley Pavillion Wednesday.
The Trojans came into the first set with a shaky start. Too many errors at the net and from the service line allowed the Bruins to build a quick lead. At an 8-point deficit, 15-7, USC began to climb back into the match with pivotal swings from junior opposite hitter Emilia Weske. The Trojans closed the lead to 4 points before UCLA took the opening set.
The Trojans played a cleaner game in the second set with less unforced errors and more open transition swings. However, the Bruins played off the energy from both the previous set and the crowd of more than 6,000 in Pauley Pavilion. UCLA took the second set, 25-20.
The Trojans got back in the match as points went back-and-forth between the two schools. USC gained a lead over the Bruins in the third set, with big service aces from graduate student middle blocker Candice Denny. The Trojans successfully held off the home team after a few close calls, ending the third set in USC’s favor, 25-21.
Entering the fourth set, UCLA intensified its defensive presence which caused problems for the Trojans at the net. USC began to fall behind after struggling to hit over the Bruins’ block. 
UCLA picked up a 7-point run in the fourth and final set, edging it closer to its first conference victory. The Bruins closed out the set despite the Trojans battling through, with a final score of 25-14.
“I think this UCLA team is one of the most physical teams in the country,”  head coach Brad Keller said. “I thought they played well tonight, they did a really nice job of serving and hitting out-of-system and digging balls.”
USC experienced difficulty on offense as its hitting percentages were as accurate as usual. With big hitters Denny and senior Brooklyn Schirmer hitting below .100, the Trojans had trouble getting their offense up and running. 
The offensive trouble, in combination with the unforced errors throughout the match, caused a loss of too many points.
“I think we just made too many errors and waited too long to get going,” Keller said. “We need to have players start to step up and pull their weight. We can’t have multiple pins and multiple middles hitting under .100, and we need to start hitting smarter shots.”
The Trojans now stand with an overall record of 4-6 and will have the chance to bounce back this weekend. USC will travel up north for its matchup against UC Berkeley.
“We have [Thursday] off, and we’ll get back at it on Friday and it’s all about Cal,” Keller said. “We’ll practice on Friday and Saturday … play them on Sunday and get back to where we need to be.”
The Trojans will play the Golden Bears Sunday at Haas Pavilion at 2 p.m.

In honor of Latinx Heritage Month, the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and Center for Latin American and Latinx Studies hosted Latinx Stories of Los Angeles Wednesday. In the Facebook Live event, three speakers — distinguished professor of American Studies & Ethnicity Natalia Molina, professor of Sociology Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo and professor of American Studies & Ethnicity and History George J. Sánchez — gathered for a discussion moderated by Associate Professor of American Studies and Ethnicity Juan de Lara on their respective books chronicling the histories of different Latinx communities in Los Angeles, from Echo Park in Central L.A. to Watts in South Central. 
Molina’s “Place-making at the Nayarit: How a Mexican Restaurant in Los Angeles Nourished its Community” centers on the role of one Mexican restaurant in supporting the local community in Echo Park and providing a space for Mexican immigrants — who were usually seen as “invisible” laborers in the city — to reclaim their voices and find belonging. Sánchez’s “Boyle Heights: How a Los Angeles Neighborhood Became the Future of American Democracy” traces the neighborhood’s history, starting from the early 20th century, and spanning decades in Boyle Heights’s journey from a multi-racial and ethnic area populated by Japanese, Jewish, African Americans and other groups to a community reconfigured by an influx of undocumented immigrants and the departure of other groups. 
An L.A. neighborhood undergoing dramatic change was also the focus of Hondagneu-Sotelo’s book “South Central Dreams,” co-authored with distinguished professor of Sociology and American Studies & Ethnicity Manuel Pastor. “South Central Dreams” explores how a historically important African American neighborhood transformed into a predominantly Latinx community over the past 40 or 50 years and the implications of such a transformation on the day-to-day lives of residents.
Following introductions, the speakers jumped into a conversation about the changing nature of “Latinidad,” or what it means to be Latinx, fueled by the interactions and connections between Latinx and other racial groups in communities. 
Hondagneu-Sotelo shared a snippet South Central’s history. During the 80s’ and 90s’, residents in neighborhoods such as Watts faced job loss, deindustrialization and street violence and Black families, specifically those with the means to, moved to the suburbs. Meanwhile, first-generation Mexican and Central Americans settled in the area for its affordable housing and job proximity. In the same vein, Sánchez reflected on the parallels between Boyle Heights and South Central in the gradual process of integration between Latinx and other ethnic and racial groups and how it shaped the Latinx experience and identity in Boyle Heights. First-generation immigrants in Boyle Heights in the early 1900s also often stayed apart from other racial groups, Sánchez said. The labor unions and schooling system became key in bringing together and creating connections between people of different races.
“​​That didn’t mean that Boyle Heights didn’t go through very difficult periods,” Sánchez said. “The periods that I talked about [were] Mexican repatriation followed by Japanese American internment during World War II. People are watching this happen to their neighbors [and] to their classmates, and they end up with a civil rights tradition that emerges in Boyle Heights.”
The speakers also shared their thoughts about their works’ place in Latinx history and scholarship, and their impacts on understanding L.A.’s complex landscape. Sánchez said their books all portrayed L.A. as a Latinx city and explored Latinx experiences where changing communities welcomed new residents to their neighborhoods, a perspective that differs from those of the past.
Molina added that their books also explored L.A. as a racialized city. Looking at the similarities the Latinx experience has with other racial and ethnic groups’ experiences in L.A. is a way to bring the different groups together on common causes.
“To me, the message of these three books is a message of hope,” Molina said. “We may have different racial and ethnic experiences, but we do understand there are commonalities in terms of access to health care, access to education, how we experience the pandemic. This is a very important moment to have this message of hope and common cause, as we see the inequalities that the pandemic has completely brought to the forefront, as we go to elect a new mayor, as we just went for a recall.”
Given that Latinx communities hold a strong position population-wise in L.A. and, thus great political power as well, Pastor — who jumped in for Hondagneu-Sotelo in the middle of the event — emphasized the importance of multiracial organizing and citywide coalitions going forward. Pastor said Black and brown organizing seeks to find common ground on shared issues and to link to greater progressive movements. Black organizers and community members in South Central rely not only Black votes but also on labor and Latinx votes. Similarly, Latinx political figures carefully consider their relationship to the Black political establishment and organizing efforts. 
“Latinos in South L.A. have developed the skill in building coalitions on a face to face, neighbor to neighbor basis as have Black people in South L.A.,” said Pastor. “That is an important skill we need citywide.”
The event concluded with De Lara expressing his gratitude for the accomplished Latinx scholars at USC working on issues that transcend disciplines. De Lara also encouraged the audience to read the books featured from the afternoon.
In a separate interview, Molina spoke on what she hopes the participants of the event take away from the conversation.
“I hope that people have a more informed and diverse sense of what it means to be Latino,” Molina said. “In dominant media, we think about Latinos as workers, maybe just immigrants, and don’t really see their lives. I think these books give you a rich history of how Latinos have been integral in terms of what it means to be a good neighbor, what it means to protest, what it means to shape democracy, what it means to participate in politics.”

Following a successful outing at the Battle in the Bay Classic in San Francisco and the Milwaukee Tennis Classic this past weekend, men’s tennis will look to carry its momentum to Athens, Ga. for the Southern Intercollegiate Championship. USC will join Georgia, Texas and Ohio State in Athens for a weekend of competition. 
“Seeing your name at the top and getting a chance to win the tournament is ultra important just to see that your hard work is paying off,” said head coach Brett Masi in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Masi said he respects the team’s opponents in this weekend’s tournament and will use these matches to see the team’s strengths and weaknesses.
“That’s where we’re really going to see where we’re at,” Masi said. “We may be adequate or we may be a little raw for the year, but, either way, we’re going to see what the other teams have and see what we need to improve on and just how we stand up against them nonetheless.” 
Masi and the players aren’t taking their ability to participate for granted after last season’s fall competitions were cancelled because of the coronavirus.
 “The fact that we’re back on campus and just competing in general right now, it’s just a breath of fresh air,” Masi said. “Last year at this time, we were wondering if we would have a season. It’s pretty big that this team’s able to congregate and practice together on a daily basis.”
This weekend will also serve as another chance for USC’s coaches to get a glimpse at the abilities of the new faces, such as freshman Peter Makk, competing on the team this year. 
“It’s going to be good, friendly competition,” Masi said. “I think you’re going to see a team that has a lot more depth and a team with a lot of grit and competitive fire.” 
USC’s competition is also heading into this tournament with some momentum from previous outings. Texas competed at the Battle in the Bay Classic where sophomore Micah Braswel and graduate senior Richard Ciamarra contributed greatly to the Longhorns, picking up four wins on the second day of the tournament. 
Georgia is coming off appearances in the Champaign 15K Future and Cary Challenger tournaments last week. The four teams competing in this weekend’s action have a combined 28 NCAA titles and 120 conference titles. 
The Trojans will begin tournament play this Friday at 11 a.m. against Ohio State. On Saturday, USC will go up against Texas at 7 a.m. and will finish up this weekend’s competition at 9 a.m. against Georgia Sunday.

Every week, the NFL features dynamic plays, statistical oddities, humorous moments and winners and losers — usually the New York Jets. I will investigate some of them here. 
Winner: Interceptions
Last season, the NFL recorded an average of 23 interceptions per week. This has been a long-running decline; the average number of interceptions per week was 24 in 2019, 25 in 2020 and a whopping 30 in 2010. 2021 might break the trend, though, because quarterbacks threw a combined 32 interceptions this week.
Most of the usual suspects contributed to the total number of interceptions. Jameis Winston, an iconic tosser of bad passes, delivered two comedic strikes: One ball hopelessly lofted into the air for an easy interception, another delivered at least 10 yards away from his closest receiver and into the waiting hands of Panthers cornerback Jaycee Horn.
Likewise, Carson Wentz flashed his mid-season form by shoveling a ball into the line of scrimmage, resulting in an interception and a personal speculation Wentz might soon turn into “Wentz on the Bench.” Finally, Trevor Lawrence built on his 3-interception debut by releasing a pair of ill-advised picks during his second game. 
But interceptions also won against some less-frequent customers. Joe Burrow managed 199 pass attempts without throwing a pick. On the 200th attempt, he snapped his streak. His next two attempts also became interceptions. 
Interceptions are the scourge of offensive coaches — for them, there’s nothing worse. But the interceptions were fun to watch. There’s something wonderful about watching an NFL quarterback, an impossibly athletic six-foot-something freak of nature, do something inexplicably stupid. It humanizes the players we love, and it delivers lots of laughter. Somewhere, someone is watching Winston’s lowlight reel and cackling. 
Loser: As always, the Jets 
Speaking of interceptions, Jets quarterback Zach Wilson threw four of them. All four were awful plays, and two of his interceptions deserve the joint honor for worst play of the week. But it’s unfair to blame Wilson. Not because it’s his second career game, but rather because MetLife Stadium, the Jets’ home, might be haunted. Unlike the Jets prior field, there aren’t any rumors about famous dead people’s bones being mixed into MetLife’s concrete, but former Jets and USC quarterback Sam Darnold told his coaches that he was “seeing ghosts” amid his own four-pick meltdown in 2019. It’s no wonder that the stadium hosts the two NFL teams with the worst records since 2017. Maybe Wilson is not ready for the NFL, maybe the ghosts got to him. Either way, the Jets lost to the Patriots in a game that was never remotely close.
Wilson might want to ask Darnold for help getting in touch with an exorcist because Darnold’s escape from MetLife is going swimmingly. He diced the Jets in an early revenge game and played good football against the Saints. Now, the Panthers are 2-0 and, as one NFL executive told The Athletic, “he looks a lot better.” It’s amazing what leaving the Jets will do for a player. 
Loser: Tyrod Taylor
Tyrod Taylor was playing really, really well. I mean, really! Yes, I know Taylor’s a career journeyman who specializes in everything average and routinely straddles the line between back-up and subpar-starter level play; however, he leads the league in QB rating so far and was torching the Browns — he went 10 of 11 for 125 yards and two total touchdowns with no picks — until he left the game with an injury at halftime.
Rookie third-rounder Davis Mills replaced Taylor. Minus Taylor playing well, his exit against the Browns wore shades of history. In 2018, the Bills replaced him with then-rookie Josh Allen. Also in 2018, Taylor picked up an injury while playing for the Browns, and they replaced him with then-rookie Baker Mayfield.
In 2020, a scarcely believable example of Taylor’s misfortune occurred: The Chargers team doctor mistakenly stabbed Taylor in the lung, collapsing it and forcing an ER visit. Taylor was then replaced by another then-rookie, Justin Herbert, who promptly relegated Taylor to back-up duties for the season. At this point, Taylor might want to consider the possibility that he’s just destined to be replaced by a rookie quarterback no matter what he does. The universe won’t leave him alone.
On another note, while it’s always unfortunate to see a player injured, it’s especially poignant when the victim is a veteran who waited a year on the bench for a chance to prove his mettle and was finally finding his groove. Taylor is 32 years old. His chances are fleeting, and it’s a shame to watch this one hurtle downstream despite Taylor’s excellent play. Get well soon, Tyrod. 
Winner: Organizational Dysfunction
The Pittsburgh Steelers have employed the same head coach, Mike Tomlin, for 14 years now and have never suffered a losing season under his stewardship. Elsewhere, Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh will finish his 13th season in charge this January with only one losing season on his record.
Both Tomlin and Harbaugh have won a Super Bowl as a head coach. In other words, the Steelers and Ravens are beacons of stability and good management. The Las Vegas Raiders, true to their home city, are, uh, not that. They’re coached by Jon Gruden, who returns after consecutive losing seasons and once said “boy, these rules are confusing” before admitting “I don’t understand football anymore.” Their general manager gained internet fame for imploring people to “look at” a prospect’s “bubble butt,” and the owner bears the haircut of a man who never learned to divorce himself from Supercuts.
Yet somehow, the Raiders are 2-0 after overcoming the Ravens during Week 1 and defeating the Steelers last Sunday. Does that make sense? Not really! The Raiders finished a meager 8-8 last year, and their roster remains largely the same. Further, what little change did occur wasn’t considered positive. For the third consecutive year, the teams’ first draft pick was considered a massive reach and its personnel moves were widely panned.
But whatever. It’s 2021, things don’t have to make sense anyways; I do most of my classes in pajama bottoms; zillionaires are flocking to space; macaque monkeys annexed a city in Thailand and the Browns won a playoff game. So, of course, the dysfunctional Raiders just beat the Ravens and the Steelers. They’ll probably win the Super Bowl, too. Actually, nevermind. That’s in 2022. Hopefully the world will have discovered a little order by then.

I wish I could tell you I’ve metamorphosed out of my cocoon and blossomed into a beautiful, chronically ill butterfly since the start of the semester; that I am successfully living on my own for the first time, totally balancing my mental and physical health and tackling my first semester back on campus like a mighty fucking monarch.
Yeah, that’s a nice wish.
Instead of celebrating the fact that I’ve even made it to this moment, I’ve felt paralyzed by this massive change of going from living with family at home to living on my own for the first time as a disabled person. 
In short, the adjustment has been like drinking from a firehose — I’m trying to swallow, accept and welcome this new challenge, while simultaneously gagging and drowning from how overwhelming it’s all been. 
Most of all, it puts an unwelcome spotlight on all the simple things my chronically ill body prevents me from doing – things I used to do with ease. By things I used to do with ease, I literally mean cooking for myself, cleaning, laundry and grocery shopping. You know, just the stuff you need to do to be remotely independent. 
Ever since the start of the semester, I’ve had to live in constant recovery mode for my body — lying down, icing, starting infusions, stopping infusions, napping, taking pills, lying down again — all so I can make it to class (barely) and then come home to start recovering again. The physical demands of being a student — traveling to and from class, walking to meetings, walking literally everywhere — are like, lowkey, so much that it all drains my reserves, fast. 
And all of this has resurfaced internal battles I thought I’d long since fought and won.
My mind feels capable of doing so much more than my chronically ill body will allow. It makes me want to scream in frustration (Wait, can butterflies scream?).
And here’s what has been the hardest to grapple with: It’s four weeks into school, and my body already can’t keep up with my mind.
In these moments specifically, it’s so hard not to fall victim to anger, frustration and self-pity toward my disabled body. It can be so easy to fall into the “Woe is me” trap, and trust me, I’ve trapped myself plenty of times. 
Last week, once the negative and anxious thoughts started, I knew things weren’t aligned. In the past, when I was newly diagnosed and coming to terms with the limitations of my disabled body, I would push through to my goal, no matter the amount of physical pain I was in. I was going to accomplish whatever I’d set my mind to, and nothing would stop me.
That wasn’t a cute look — I mean, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. In my case, I was holding myself, my body, to the same physical expectations I had when I was younger and more able-bodied.
However, if there’s anything becoming chronically ill has taught me, it’s that maintaining my mental health requires not pushing through when I’m feeling burnt out. I’ve learned time and time again that forcing “mind over matter” never ends well. 
This time around, I finally put all those years of therapy to practice. I was able to recognize the signs and symptoms of my worsening mental and physical health — and that was something to be proud of.
This past week, I realized I needed to step back. Pause. Breathe. Slow down, and remember who I am. More importantly, I needed to remember the things that help me feel like I can be my best self. 
I am someone who does great with a lot of sleep. I am someone who performs well when I have enough breaks. I am someone who needs regular snacks and hydration, like a butterfly needs its nectar, to make it through the day. I am someone who needs exercise, who needs to feel connected to their body, in order to be my best self. I am someone who shows up for the people they love. I am someone who is determined to get my education without compromising my mental and physical health.
It’s clear to me now I haven’t given myself enough credit for recognizing that I’m still in transition, that things still feel clunky, uncertain and that my body is adjusting on its own time. However, there are things I can do to help it adjust, and in that sense, maybe I can forgive myself for the fact that I’m still metamorphosing. 
So, repeat after me: I am a mighty fucking monarch who is patient, loving and does things at a pace that respects my body, and going slower or taking an unconventional route doesn’t make me any less mighty than other monarchs — it makes me the mightiest.

Although California has historically protected abortion rights, federal challenges to Roe v. Wade could severely impact the accessibility of legal abortions. In 2017, the Guttmacher Institute estimated that providers performed 132,680 abortions in California — a rate of around 16.4 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age. 
Studies repeatedly show that low-income and Black, Indigenous and communities of color typically abort at significantly higher rates than affluent white populations. In South Central, a diverse and populous region, any possible restriction on abortion harms vulnerable populations. If an anti-abortion law, such as the Texas Heartbeat Act, reaches the Supreme Court, which may declare any pro-choice legislation as unconstitutional and thereby overturn Roe v. Wade, the subsequent violation of human rights would be a product of Christian Fundamentalism, the underlying philosophy driving the pro-life movement. 
In fact, the Texas restriction, which doesn’t even allow for rape victims to abort as early as six weeks, is morally repugnant. However, absurd policies like this are not the product of anything but U.S. ideological regression. It’s not the product of — or even comparable to — Islam, per se. 
However, the liberal establishment has spun it this way. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, actress and white feminist Alyssa Milano criticized the “Texas Taliban” for infringing upon women’s rights. A week later, The Day published an article titled, “Texas turns to Taliban model with its vigilante abortion ban.” 
So, what purpose do these comparisons serve? Independent of the Taliban, conservative opposition to reproductive rights in the U.S. has existed and thrived for decades. Also, it’s not as if Afghanistan and the United States are the only two countries with rampant, systemic misogyny. Understandably, the Taliban has dominated the news cycle over the last few weeks, just like Texas, but does that warrant a comparison between the two? No, it does not. 
Comparing Texas and the Taliban presupposes that their injustices are significantly similar. While both the U.S. and Afghanistan perpetuate misogyny, that’s not exclusive to either culture, especially since patriarchy is worldwide. Contemporary feminist criticism of Afghanistan typically focuses on human rights violations, such as depriving women of education. 
However, it’s a stretch to compare the plight of Afghan women to U.S. injustices. In this case, U.S. reproductive rights do not solely target women, whereas the Taliban religiously subjugate women. All too often, transgender, nonbinary and intersex communities are excluded from abortion discourse in the U.S., even as they are affected by these unjust policies. While the Taliban also oppose LGBTQ+ rights, that tenet of their philosophy is distinct from their misogyny, whereas in the U.S. reproductive rights discourse, systemic misogyny and queerphobia collapse together as inseparable.
While Western religion collectively skews the morals of the populace, that’s a different story; but to single out the Taliban in this analogy instead of oppressive U.S. social structures is sickening. There’s even a bit of a novelty and shock factor in comparing Texas to the Taliban because it portrays Texas as unequivocally evil. Would it have riled up Milano’s liberal supporters in the same way if she characterized Texas with the Christian theology that popularized fetuses as having a right to life at conception? It’s doubtful. 
Pro-choice activists are correct in identifying that abortion litigation is essential to protect human rights. However, it’s necessary to keep an eye on the ball when it comes to freedom because comparing struggles rarely leads to anything productive. In this case, the equivalence of Texas and the Taliban cheapens the suffering of Afghan women by commodifying it into a liberal talking point. 
Rather than deflecting attention to the Taliban, it’d be more appropriate to focus on the deep-rooted conservative undercurrent that runs through the U.S. By virtue-signaling about the Taliban, even by saying we’re adopting their methods, we’re distracting ourselves from the centuries of groundwork behind developing the U.S. patriarchy. The Texas Heartbeat Act does not liken us more to the Taliban than to a more reactionary version of U.S. social conservatism, which has repeatedly shown its face with or without an Islamic fundamentalist group assuming power in a different continent. 
When it comes to the intersection of sexual liberation and gender politics, the U.S. consistently falls conservative. Aside from abortion itself, many states, including Texas, lack holistic sexual education — usually defaulting to abstinence-only curricula — and do not provide free contraceptives. Christian morals have made the U.S. so sterile that conversations about sex are considered problematic and unvirtuous. The puritan ideological nature of the U.S. stigmatizes such topics, systemically endangering women and other vulnerable communities in the process.
The above issues, engrained and enforced by U.S. power structures, are entirely independent of the Taliban. Nonetheless, reproductive justice is worth pursuing. While the fight to restore reproductive rights will be grueling, it’s nonsensical to resort to comparing vastly different struggles and injustices just to enrage one’s base. Moving forward, if the U.S. would like to solve its pressing social issues, it needs to self-examine and transform rather than deflect to the most convenient political distraction.

Last Thursday night, Hollywood Boulevard was once again inundated with hipsters. A flurry of teenagers clad in platform Doc Martens, vintage denim and bubble braids buzzed with excitement as they gushed over the return of live music. Sloan Struble, frontman of the band Dayglow, garnered such a crowd with ease after gaining immense traction in the music industry this past year.
Dayglow touched down in Los Angeles last Thursday for two back-to-back sold out shows at the Fonda Theater. They drew a young crowd that bursted with tangible, pent-up energy from such a long dry spell without live shows. The fans flooded into the venue, quickly occupying the intimate space and chanting out the band’s name before the openers had even stepped onto the stage. 
As the beginning notes to “Something,” the opening track from Dayglow’s newest album, “Harmony House,” erupted from the sound system, the crowd’s energy was unleashed. Sloan wandered onto the stage to meet his band wearing a grey tuxedo with a single white sleeve and a million dollar smile. His awkward yet endearing charm is one of the most loveable parts of a Dayglow show. He energetically jumped and clumsily danced around the stage, belting out the words in unison with the crowd.
Sloan stood dumbfounded and humbled before the crowded venue, visibly taken aback by the adoring fans at the foot of the stage. From this point on, the band relentlessly played through their discography, playing every song fans came to hear. As they alternated between their debut album, “Fuzzybrain,” and songs from their newest release, the simple LED light backdrop flashed orange or blue based on the respective album’s art colors. 
Sloan is a dynamic and eccentric performer. Each song engendered a unique response from the audience, but the entire setlist was infused with Dayglow’s signature 80s-inspired synth feel and danceable melodies. Sloan brought a palpable energy to the stage for enthusiastic hits such as “Hot Rod” but was able to completely entrance the audience from his seat at the piano for ballads such as “Dear Friend” and “Fuzzybrain.” For tracks with a heavier emphasis on lyricism like “December,” audience members sang together, fostering an emphatic response to the optimism seeping out of the songs. 
As the main set came to a close, fans knew what was coming. The band began to play their biggest hit, “Can I Call You Tonight?” — The already-buzzing energy in the venue reached its apex. The crowd bounced in sync, sweaty and jubilant, with an occasional mosh pit opening up to absorb some of the excitement. 
This moment was surely as surreal for the band as it was for the audience. At only 22, Sloan has catapulted into the alternative music scene. Three short years ago, Sloan was producing in his bedroom to play songs for his friends. Now, he is among iconic artists in millions of Spotify playlists and has completely sold out his nationwide tour.
Even at the set’s end, the moment persisted. The crowd began cheering and chanting for an encore. The energy permeated the air and beckoned the band back onstage in mere seconds. The emotionally-charged show culminated in two perfectly chosen songs. The band first embarked on a cover of “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” by Tears for Fears, setting the crowd ablaze yet again. In arguably the best moment of the night, they seamlessly transitioned into their song “Run the World!!!” in response to the Tears for Fears track.
As Sloan confidently belted out, “I wanna run the world,” it was apparent that there was a room of hopefuls who felt the same. This was the most prevalent theme of the night, regardless of the track; Dayglow’s music is infused with a sense of relatability that draws in all types of listeners. 
The band took its final bows, and the horde of fans reluctantly dissipated, hurriedly finalizing their Instagram story posts to memorialize an unforgettable performance.

Creation is often seen as a godly power. It is an action that allows someone to manifest an immaterial idea into a physical form that can be felt, heard or seen by others. New York-born Katya Pearl Urban is the founder of Angel Boy World, a fashion brand that sells jewelry and upcycled clothes with designs by Urban. If creation is a godly power, then how fitting is it that her brand be named after a heavenly creature.
Urban, a junior majoring in film production, came up with the idea for Angel Boy World during quarantine last year. During isolation, she would occupy herself by sketching characters. One day, she drew the character that would eventually become “Angel Boy,” and it stirred a sense of importance in her. 
“Angel Boy just felt like he was meant to be more than this sketch, and I just started to develop this world,” Urban said. “It just felt like it made sense because it’s transportable art, and it’s a way to reach out to people.” 
Angel Boy World began with a few T-shirts decorated with dark line drawings that appeared to represent a sort of melancholic sensibility. One T-shirt read, “i don’t feel like a king.” It is through these pensive yet simple comments Katya alludes to deeper themes such as the exploration of masculinity and the abandonment of the youthful spirit as one grows older. It is these things that Katya attempts to capture and redefine with Angel Boy World. 
“When I was a kid, I was so scared of growing up, but now, I’m 20. I am growing up and feel less scared,” Urban said. “I think I’m realizing that, just because I’m growing up, doesn’t mean I need to let go of my inner child, and it’s still always a part of you as long as you don’t forget about it.”
The idea behind preserving her inner child revolves around the way in which kids can be “present” in a way that’s difficult as you grow up. Along with this philosophy, Urban makes it a point to take risks and to never remain stagnant. 
“I think I’m trying to play it less safe and not limiting to what I think is wearable,” Urban said about future pieces in Angel Boy World. “In general, my goal is to take more risks because playing it safe is boring.” 
Over time, Angel Boy World developed into different pieces, such as tank top shirts, face masks, jeans and skirts. Urban has always been creative and willing to explore new ideas in order to improve her art. With Angel Boy World, she’s planned several events, one of the most notable being an art gallery she put together in Brooklyn with friends who participate in a variety of art forms and mediums. 
Dhante Bunbury, a friend of Urban since middle school, has seen Urban grow into herself as the years passed by. Bunbury witnessed Urban’s artistry develop and change as she has matured. He describes her as “textured” and always thinking of her artistry. 
“Like nine times out of ten she has a camera or her camcorder on her,” Bunbury said. “So you know whether it’s video, photo or film … She always has that on her, so she can always use you as a subject for a shot she’s thinking of or just a reference or something. But, it’s always gonna be a maze that you’re not even gonna want to get out of [with her].”
Urban’s work is specific and targeted, centering on ideas she finds salient and important. Bunbury describes her eye for detail and the curiosity that define her personality. 
“It’s not a broad thing for Katya ever,” Bunbury said. “It’s never broad because that’s something that can be done so simply and fast. It’s always why, how, who, when.”
Urban’s drive and dedication is something she extends to her friendships as well according to Bunbury. 
“She helps me become a somewhat true version of myself,” Bunbury said. “She always helps me push my boundaries.”
Urban is more than just a fashion designer. In the same way that Angel Boy World is a multifaceted brand, Urban is a multifaceted creator as seen with her passion for filmmaking and music. 
“I think we live in a time where people can do multiple things and it can be uplifted,” Urban said. “[But], I think there’s a fine line between being a jack of all trades and a master of none. And I’m trying to be patient because I want to feel strongly that I know what I’m doing, and I know what my connection is to each art form that I feel connected with.”
The variety of Urban’s passions is evident in all of her endeavours. She’s found ways to integrate all the mediums that she participates in, from writing songs for films she has made, to making and editing videos for her fashion brand, to wearing her own pieces during her performances. 
To both Bunbury and another friend of Urban’s, Rahul Manwani, she is known to make people feel comfortable. Her energy and personality exude a curiosity that makes all those who meet her immediately let their guard down. 
“Hanging out with [Urban] is like being comfortable,” said Manwani, a junior majoring in animation. “She makes people comfortable very quickly and [is] naturally very kind and understanding and always curious — wanting to listen to what people say.”
Manwani shared an anecdote about Katya’s love of other people, describing a time when she played basketball with a 60-year-old man and expressed her love for interacting with all kinds of people and learning about their lives. 
“Katya’s a sharer, like she could meet someone and talk about something personal within a matter of minutes,” Manwani said. “There’s just an empathy and vulnerability that comes with how comfortable she makes you and people will be spilling their guts to her in like the first or second meeting.”
