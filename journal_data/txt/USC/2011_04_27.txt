Six suspects were arrested Wednesday in connection with a string of robberies that occurred in the North University Park Area two weeks ago.
One suspect has been positively identified by one of the victims, according to the Dept. of Public Safety. There is evidence the other five suspects might also be linked to the crimes.
“One suspect was definitely identified by one of the victims,” said DPS Capt. David Carlisle. “DPS made the original detention on the [suspect who] was identified.”
The six suspects were arrested within two days of each other; three on April 20, one on April 21 and two on April 22, according to the Incident Resolution Notice released by DPS on Wednesday.
“We are very pleased about that,” Carlisle said. “It was a collaborate effort between DPS and LAPD.”
The Incident Resolution Notice provided information on the arrests of six suspects responsible for three robberies that occurred within six minutes of each other, on Ellendale Place, West 29th Street, and 27th Street on April 11.
In all three of the robberies, weapons were displayed. According to the incident resolution notice, the suspects approached the victims, displayed weapons, demanded their property and fled the scene by foot.
Your headline convicted the dude. At this point, he’s still a suspect, whether he was “positively identified” or not.

The Office of Sustainability, which was opened in 2009, has plans to finally establish a central location this summer and to hire a new manager.
Garden · The Office of Sustainability and Urban Farming created a community garden that provides vegetables and a gardening experience. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Ed Becker, the executive director of the Department of Environmental Health and Safety and the interim manager of the Office of Sustainability, said the office hopes to be responsive to students’ wants and needs regarding environmental issues on campus.
“The office is here to create a ‘living laboratory’ for sustainability, where the living laboratory is the campus,” Becker said. “Students can learn about it but they can also have a canvas to try things out.”
He said the office is in the final stages of hiring a new full-time manager to replace Matthew Oden, who was the university’s first full-time sustainability manager. That process should be complete next month.
The office’s has one full-time staff member and three student workers.
Becker said the office’s one other full-time staff member and three student workers work independently, so there is no central location. This summer, however, Becker said the office will move into 3232 Grand, where all members can work in one single designated space.
“It will be kind of a landing spot,” Becker said.
Since the office opened, Becker said the sustainability office has helped coordinate efforts among various campus stakeholders.
“Administrative units have been active for years on energy conservation projects, dining hall improvements, transportation enhancements, housing projects,” Becker said. “However, the beginning of coordinated activities has helped unite individuals working on like projects.”
Becker said the office does this by bringing all the departments together into one forum and enabling each to feed off the others. Before the office was created, every administrative department had its own sustainability initiatives.
“The office really serves as a central hub for coordinating a lot of activities,” Becker said. “It’s a place of information about what each program is doing.”
According to Daniela Arellano, a student worker in the Office of Sustainability, one of the big projects the office has been working on is the online Dashboard. The online tool will be easily accessible for anybody interested in learning where most of USC’s energy consumption comes.
Many on-campus buildings have special equipment that adds up the amount of energy consumed per building every 15 minutes. This information is sent to the Dashboard, which then adds it up for the day separated by each building individual and displays it online.
“If [people] learn something about sustainability or want to see if they can affect behavior in their dormitory, they will have enough information to track their progress,” Becker said.
To access the Dashboard, anyone interested — even those outside the USC community — can email the Office of Sustainability and get the username and password.
Arellano said the office hopes students will be interested in learning which departments are using the most energy.
“With the Dashboard, we hope we can develop a sort of culture to make people aware of what their buildings are using to encourage people to reduce their energy usage,” Arellano said.
Becker said in the coming years, the office hopes to launch a new marketing approach to engage incoming students in sustainability initiatives.
“We hope to make USC more sustainable by integrating everyone’s efforts ranging from student organizations, to what teachers are teaching in the classrooms, to the way a certain department purchases green products,” Arellano said.
Will Goldman, a junior majoring in music, said he would like to see the university continue striving to have the smallest carbon footprint possible.
“They should help us improve our ability to recycle more,” Goldman said. “And I would like to see the use of more recycled materials in the campus center.”
I’ve heard from my student that the trash in the dorms is not recycled. Is this true and, if so, why?

This weekend marks a holiday celebrated throughout much of the world as International Workers’ Day, and one USC student has played a leading role in organizing an event in honor of the occasion.
International Workers’ Day, also known as May Day, is not officially observed in the United States, unlike much of the world, although many people use it as a day to protest in support of workers’ rights.
Tiffany Scalia, a senior majoring in Spanish and international relations, planned and organized a free music and arts festival, that will take place Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. at the Hoover Recreation Center on the corner of Hoover Street and Adams Boulevard. Scalia hopes the event will to unite the community in celebration of May Day.
Keeping with the spirit of May Day, Scalia said the festival will be aimed at increasing awareness of the struggles still faced by laborers. She is hoping for a large turnout from USC students as well as community members.
“Students should be concerned about these things because they are the future,” Scalia said. “If we hope to see the world progress in a positive way, the exploitation on a global scale has to stop.”
Scalia planned the festival as a lead-in to Sunday’s annual May Day March and Rally for Immigrant and Workers’ Rights in Downtown Los  Angeles.
Meetings regarding the festival started in February, after Scalia approached friends about putting her ideas into action. She was inspired after talking to a producer of the Sunset Strip Music Festival, who said the event was originally organized to decrease racial tension and xenophobia in the community.
Scalia initially approached several friends, including USC students and alumni, for help in organizing the festival, and recruited volunteers from her network and from community-focused organizations like USC Creating Just Communities.
After she graduates this year, Scalia plans to continue the festival as an annual event organized by a council of students from local high schools in conjunction with a group of USC students. She hopes this will promote community involvement and unity.
Each year, Scalia said, the festival will focus on a specific labor rights issue.
This year’s festival will ask the Dole Corporation to provide fair compensation for the hundreds of banana workers suffering from the pesticides used in the company’s Nicaraguan plantations. According to the Los Angeles Times, more than $2 billion have been given to Dole banana farmers workers who claimed to be unable to have children because of pesticide poisoning.
There will be flyers and other informational material about the Nicaraguan banana workers at the festival, as well as letters attendees can sign and send to the Dole Corporation demanding action.
“The festival isn’t trying to shove social issues down peoples’ throats, although it will be trying to raise awareness,” said May Day Festival volunteer Quyen Le, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television.
In addition to promoting labor rights, Scalia hopes the festival will develop into a meaningful connection between USC and the community.
“I had the idea to create a festival in the USC area to increase meaningful interaction between community members and USC because I hate that that divide exists,” Scalia said. “We are all members of this community and that dichotomy shouldn’t be there. I’m trying to alleviate that through this festival.”
The North Area Neighborhood Development Council, an organization dedicated to the well-being of the communities around USC, is co-sponsoring the event. NANDC members see the event as a significant advancement in the development of relations between USC students and the community.
“NANDC is currently working with the local parks in the community to be sure that homegrown festivals like this have community support and are for the betterment of the community,” said Shawn Simons, president of NANDC. “We’re very impressed that this is something they wanted to take on and put together on their own because it’s something that is important for the development of this community.”
The festival will include a full lineup of live music and entertainment from local artists, a kids’ zone with activities and crafts, an art gallery and live painting across the park. There will also be food, book and clothing drives set up in collaboration with Food Not Bombs, Books For People and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul Council of Los Angeles.
What a joke.  You people are so out of touch.
Awesome event! Hope to see lots of students and community members there

President C. L. Max Nikias and Vice President of Admissions and Planning Katharine Harrington held a ceremony at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center yesterday to announce USC has received the largest single scholarship donation in the university’s history.
Julie and John Mork donated $110 million to USC to fund the Mork Family Scholars Program, which will provide a select group of undergraduate students full tuition and $5,000 living stipends for four years.
Celebrate · President C. L. Max Nikias speaks about the Mork family and their $110 million donation. John Mork graduated from USC with a degree in engineering in 1970. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
“I’m thrilled about the future. We were worried education is going up cost-wise and great kids cannot get in,” John Mork said. “We want to help anyway we can. We are really blessed to be able to do this.”
About 100 undergraduates will benefit from the scholarships each year, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The Mork family specifically requested a portion of each year’s Mork Scholars come from high schools in the community surrounding the USC area.
“Julie and John and their family believe that education plays a valuable role in life,” Nikias said. “The greatest gift given to another individual is the gift of education.”
Nikias, who has been president of the university for about eight months, has helped acquire five sizable donations already.
When Nikias was inaugurated Oct. 15, trustee Ming Hsieh announced a $50 million donation to the university for cancer research, and the Annenberg Foundation announced a $50 million donation to construct a new building for the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism. More recently, Dana and David Dornsife donated $200 million in an unrestricted endowment to the USC College of Letters, Arts & Sciences. Roger and Michele Dedeaux Engemann have also donated $15 million to build a new student health center.
This new scholarship fund will assist students who could otherwise not afford USC.
“It is great that the scholarships will help students from local communities who may be doing well in school, but facing local disparities,” said Carmina Gomez, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention.
Mork Scholars will have the same benefits as Trustee and Presidential Scholars, which include living at the residential honors college and access to other programs throughout their time at USC.
Lisa Verzemnieks, a Trustee Scholar and senior majoring in civil engineering, said her scholarship changed her educational path.
“My family was not in the position to send me to my dream school, but being a Trustee Scholar has given me more opportunities than I could have ever imagine,” Verzemneiks said. “I would not be here without people like the Mork family.”
John Mork graduated from USC in 1970 with a degree in petroleum engineering.
He is currently the chief executive of Energy Corp. of America, a private company that handles the exploration, extraction, production and transportation of natural gas and oil, based in Denver, Colorado.
Julie Mork, who graduated from UCLA, is the managing director of the Energy Corp. of America Foundation, a charitable organization that focuses on children and education.
The Morks are not new to offering philanthropic gifts to the university. In 2005, the family donated $15 million to benefit the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, and the department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science is now named in honor of the Mork family.
To show appreciation for their gift, USC will be place a plaque with the names and images of the Mork family at Bovard Auditorium.
“This may seem like a celebration of a gift, but it is really a celebration of the future,” Mork said.

The No. 3 USC men’s tennis team traveled to Ojai, Calif. on Wednesday, to play in the Pac-10 championships, which begins today and continues through the weekend.
Last year the Trojans (21-2, 6-0) fell to rival UCLA in the later rounds of the tournament, but in 2011, after finishing undefeated in Pac-10 play, they hope to make a comeback and claim the postseason title.
Coming off of a close 4-3 win over the Bruins, USC appears ready to finish strong this weekend and have emphasized fundamentals in recent weeks.
“We’ve been doing a lot of fitness and just the basics,” said junior Daniel Nguyen. “The same things we’ve done for the past few months.”
The Trojans have battled injury throughout the season, but were able to finish strong with a full lineup with the NCAAs on the horizon.
“We have to stay healthy and improve on our game daily,” Nguyen said. “We have to push ourselves.”
Freshman Ray Sarmiento will likely pair back with junior Steve Johnson in the A doubles draw. The two are currently ranked at No. 34 in the nation, and a strong showing in Ojai could place them in the mix for a national championship. Both Nguyen and Gomez might also return as a pair for the tournament.
All eight players that played in the regular season will travel to the tournament, split between the A and B draw. Freshman Michael Grant, who would enter the B draw, sprained his ankle in practice Tuesday and will be a game-time decision.
As back-to-back national champions, USC is focused on the task at hand, but ultimately has its eyes on winning it all for the third year in a row.
Nguyen credits last year’s Pac-10 championships with serving as a good precursor for the NCAA tournament, which awaits.
“You can find your game at these tournaments,” Nguyen said. “Last year I did well and that [momentum] spilled over into the NCAAs.”

After a four-game road swing, the USC baseball team had a home game Tuesday.
But with the way the team played in the 7-1 loss to Long Beach State, USC interim coach Frank Cruz is probably happy to get back on the road.
The Trojans (18-22, 8-7) will finish a swing in which seven of eight games have been away from Dedeaux Field this weekend when they travel to Frank Sancet Stadium to take on Arizona.
The Wildcats (24-16, 6-9) welcome USC on Friday night at 5 p.m. hoping to turn around recent struggles. Arizona lost to rival Arizona State for the fourth time this season Tuesday and has lost five of six games.
After being ranked as high as No. 11 following a 17-5 start, Arizona has run into trouble since starting Pac-10 play. The Wildcats are only 6-9 in conference games and have only won one series despite winning the series opener four of five times.
They’ve been so successful in game one because of the arm of Orange County’s Kurt Heyer. The sophomore right-hander has a 6-3 record, a minuscule 2.20 ERA and has struck out 95 batters in 86 innings while issuing only 20 base on balls.
Heyer, however, started on three-days rest Tuesday as the Wildcats tried to take down their archrivals, so it will be Kyle Simon on the mound Friday night. The 6-foot-5 righty has a 7-3 record with a 2.95 ERA. He is coming off a three-hit complete game against Oregon in his last start.
To beat Simon, USC will need junior Andrew Triggs (3-3, 4.52 ERA) to replicate his performance from last week when he threw a complete game five-hitter as the Trojans beat Washington 2-1.
Junior Austin Wood (4-5, 4.69 ERA) will start Saturday for USC. He will likely take on Tyler Hale (3-4, 5.26 ERA), who isn’t on firm ground. Hale is 0-4 in Pac-10 play, and his ERA jumped to 9.43 after he allowed four runs in one and two-thirds innings in his last start.
The series finale will feature senior Logan Odom (3-5, 3.49 ERA), who has helped the Trojans win their last three conference series. Odom won the rubber match in two of those series.
Arizona’s Sunday starter has still yet to be determined. But don’t be surprised to see Heyer return even though it’s unconventional to see collegiate starters pitch a midweek and weekend game. If he doesn’t start, he’s likely to be used as a reliever throughout the series.
If the Trojans want to improve on their fourth place standing in the Pac-10, they need to get into Arizona’s bullpen where the Wildcats have a 5.79 ERA this season.
USC will also have to contain an offense that averages 6.7 runs per game and is hitting .320 as a team. Joey Rickard (.402) and Cole Frenzel (.387) lead an Arizona offense that features six hitters batting .315 and above.
In comparison, the Trojans’ offense has only two batters hitting better than .300 with junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa’s .345 batting average, six home runs and 33 RBI leading the way.
The Trojans will try to return to their winning ways after their five-game streak was broken last week.
Before losing its last two games, USC had won eight of 10 games.

The No. 21 USC men’s golf team swings into the postseason this weekend as the Pac-10 championship kicks off at the Stanford Golf Course.
All the teams in the Pac-10 will be in attendance this Friday through Sunday.
“There will be a lot of good teams at the tournament this weekend, and the competition should be great,” said sophomore Martin Trainer. “Despite that, we are really just worried with our own success.”
The team is coming off three consecutive top-three finishes, first place at the Thunderbird Invitational with a 15-under-par 837 (287, 271, 279), second place at the Western Intercollegiate and third place at Callaway Collegiate Match Play. The team finished its regular season strong and hopes to ride that momentum into the postseason.
Starting Friday at 8 a.m., the team will play 36 holes on the par 70 course and 18 holes both Saturday and Sunday. USC holds the record for most Pac-10 tournament wins with 18, as well as 20 individual champions.
The Trojans will be led by sophomore T.J. Vogel and junior Steve Lim, with Trainer, freshman Ramsey Sahyoun, freshman Jeffrey Kang and sophomore Sam Smith rounding out the squad. All six golfers have had very strong seasons, and USC’s team is one of the best in the field.
“We have the deepest team, and that’s one of our strong points. Our sixth man is easily the best out there,” Trainer said. “We have so much talent, I feel like we can do great. We just have to prepare well and when the time comes, play our best.”
Following their recent success and the strength of the squad, the Trojans hope to continue their trend of winning and make a strong showing at the tournament.
“I think we have a really good chance to win. We have been playing really well lately,” Trainer said. “So have UCLA and even Stanford, but not as strong as we have.”
Golf Marketing Services creates a tangible buzz in the marketplace for its clients with a collaborative toolbox of services.

The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team has fought through this season with vigor and focus borne from years of being close, but not quite there.
Leading the way · Senior setter Riley McKibben, who has more than 1,000 assists this season, was the first recruit to commit to USC in 2008. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
In 2008, the Trojans dropped a hard-fought NCAA tournament play-in game. In 2009, they fell hard in a five-set heartbreaker to UC Irvine in the national championship game. And in 2010, after starting the season as the No. 1 team in the country, the Trojans were unceremoniously eliminated from the NCAA tournament in the first round.
But in 2011, the Trojans have won the close matches and dominated others with skill and poise spearheaded by the team’s eight senior leaders.
During the last four seasons, these seniors have amassed 72 victories, notched two preseason No. 1 rankings, won both the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation regular season and tournament crowns and earned a trip to the NCAA championship match.
Frankly, they have revived USC volleyball.
“We wouldn’t be here without them,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “They embody what USC is supposed to be and helped put USC volleyball back on the map.”
When Ferguson was hired in 2007, he took over a team stuck in a slump that included four-straight 11th place finishes in the 12-team Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
The year of Ferguson’s arrival spelled the beginning of a revival for USC volleyball, however, as USC racked up the most victories since 2001 (12) and made an appearance in the MPSF playoffs.
“We weren’t good athletically or academically [when I first arrived],” Ferguson said.
Although he lacked collegiate head coaching experience, the young coach was confident he could help put USC volleyball back on the map.
“I knew how to recruit, put a team together and get things going,” Ferguson said. “I always said that if there were a school that could revive themselves, it would be USC.”
Ferguson had an ambitious goal: He wanted not only the best athletes, but also top students and leaders who could be successful in all aspects.
After a successful first season, Ferguson brought the top-ranked recruiting class to USC in 2008, setting the stage for success.
“It is with no exaggeration when I say that they took over the team and changed the face of the program once they arrived on campus,” Ferguson said. “All of them have been great leaders in their own way.”
Setter Riley McKibbin, who has been the Trojans’ co-captain for three consecutive years, was the first to commit to Ferguson’s plan for USC volleyball and then helped the coach pull in the talent he needed.
“Right away, [McKibbin] asked for [senior middle blocker Austin] Zahn and [senior opposite Murphy] Troy’s phone numbers and promised me that he would get them to come to USC too,” Ferguson said.
Now, four years later, that recruiting class has carried USC, already atop the polls for most of the season, nearing an NCAA title.
Troy, who has led USC in kills in each of the last three seasons, has been the Trojans’ co-captain for two years, and last week, received MPSF Player of the Year honors.
Others, such as Zahn and outside hitter Tri Bourne, have proved to be steady, reliable contributors, fixtures in USC’s starting lineup.
“There’s plenty of great volleyball players out there, but not a lot of great USC players,” Ferguson said. “All of these guys have and will be successful, and not just in volleyball.”
With their first MPSF tournament victory against No. 8 UCLA last Saturday, these seniors are primed to make one final run at a national title with a simple mentality: Winning one day, one match, one practice and one play at a time.
“They’ve done everything we’ve asked as well as I could’ve hoped,” Ferguson said. “Every time someone has taken a shot at them, they’ve responded. They’ve done great to this point, but we have much more to do.”

Although this year’s USC draft class lacks both the quantity and quality of talent the program is accustomed to, offensive tackle Tyron Smith and his top-10 projection in today’s NFL draft help mask the lack of first-round talent the Trojans offer to the NFL this year.
Smith, who has been rumored to be a favorite of the Cowboys at No. 9 overall, has taken hold of the top tackle spot among potential draftees. Teams are keen on his ability to become a franchise bookend on the left side of the offensive line.
Since the college season ended, Smith has seen his stock soar among NFL scouts, who drool over his unique combination of size and athleticism. The biggest concern for Smith was his slightly undersized playing weight of 285 pounds, but at USC’s Pro Day, the 6-foot-5 lineman answered those questions weighing in at 310 pounds, while still maintaining his mobility and lateral quickness.
Originally courted by the New York Giants, who sit at No. 18 overall, Smith had a plethora of scouts, most notably Cowboys’ coach Jason Garrett, in awe during his workouts.
Quarterback Mitch Mustain has a tough road ahead of him, as he looks to be drafted by an NFL team or brave the unstable world of an undrafted free agent. While being a rookie free agent is usually a more coveted position than being taken in the last two rounds, the NFL lockout throws a wrench in those plans as teams will not be allowed to work out guys until the lawsuit is settled.
In the later rounds, the New England Patriots, along with the Philadelphia Eagles, seem to have their eye on wide receiver Ronald Johnson, a player who fits  the Bill Belichick mold and the Patriots offensive system. Though Johnson didn’t run as well as hoped during his USC Pro Day, he has value as a kick returner and slot receiver because of his quickness and reliable hands.
On the defensive side of the ball, defensive tackle Jurrell Casey ranks seventh on ESPN’s big board among defensive tackles, despite a subpar Pro Day.
Cornerback Shareece Wright, who is among the top 15 cornerbacks in this year’s draft, has teams eyeing him in the middle to late rounds. Wright has great instincts on the outside and shows signs of becoming an effective bump-and-run cornerback, which is a great asset coming straight out of college.
Tight end Jordan Cameron, a solid performer in his own right on Pro Day, is among the top players at his position and might top them all in sheer athleticism. Cameron wowed scouts with his great body control and soft hands.
Despite his limited experience, Cameron intrigued NFL scouts who saw his skills translate very well into a pro game that continually emphasizes speed and an overall fast pace.

It’s been a crazy year in college athletics.
Scandals ran rampant across college football and college basketball. The NCAA tournament certainly defined madness. But amid all of this, it was clear the cardinal and gold still boasts some, if not most, of the top teams in the nation across all sports.
So as the year comes to a close, I thought it would be fitting to count down the top five storylines in USC athletics in the last year.
 
No. 5: USC men’s basketball rollercoaster ride
The season didn’t start off well for the men’s basketball team, as it was blown out by 20 points by Rider at home. But then the Trojans made a complete 180, defeating then-No. 20 Texas at home and then-No. 18 Tennessee on the road. To start off conference play, they edged rival UCLA — and it was then that I thought maybe this could be the year USC had a decent shot at making an NCAA tournament run.
Up-and-down conference play squelched those dreams a bit. But USC ended the season defeating then-No. 10 Arizona at home and Washington on the road.
But then the Pac-10 tournament brought about even more storylines as USC coach Kevin O’Neill allegedly hit a University of Arizona booster after the Trojans’ first-round win against California. In the infamous words of O’Neill, he claimed he “works hard and plays hard.”
It’s too bad his team couldn’t bring the same energy and fire O’Neill exhibited when USC was ousted in the first four round of the Big Dance.
 
No. 4: Women of Troy’s postseason run
For the second consecutive year, the USC women’s basketball team was, in my opinion, snubbed from playing in the NCAA tournament.
Unlike last year, however, USC coach Michael Cooper accepted a bid to play in the Women’s National Invitational Tournament.
The team didn’t necessarily end the regular season on a high note, but it started clicking at the right time. Junior guard Ashley Corral’s move to a reserve role gave the Women of Troy a scoring threat off the bench and allowed senior guard Jacki Gemelos to facilitate the offense for the starting unit. An unprecedented run to the title game had USC one win away from its first postseason title since 1984, but the Women of Troy fell short to Toledo. Even though it wasn’t necessarily the tournament they wanted, the Women of Troy almost came away as Queens of the Dance.
 
No. 3: Freshman Sophia Popov captures individual Pac-10 title
Popov’s successful freshman campaign has given the German native a top-10 ranking as the postseason approaches. She helped lead USC women’s golf to a Pac-10 championship, while also capturing the individual title. She has been instrumental in the team’s success, and despite her youth, she helped carry USC when it lost junior Lisa McCloskey to an injury during the Pac-10 tournament. Popov became just the fourth Woman of Troy to capture an individual championship, and first since 2000.
 
No. 2: Senior opposite Murphy Troy’s record-breaking season
It was the first time I watched a men’s volleyball game this season, and I was not the least disappointed. As physically dominant as Troy is, I would think he could probably play tight end on the football team. Troy’s résumé donning the cardinal and gold has been filled with almost every accolade.
This year at Pepperdine, he broke the USC career rally scoring era record for kills. Troy also recorded his 125th career ace against BYU and broke the all-time USC record in the rally scoring era with that stat.
He was just named the MPSF player of the year last Thursday, and he has led the Trojans to a regular-season best 21-2 record. The senior is now looking to lead USC to its first NCAA championship since 1990.
 
No. 1: USC men’s water polo three-peat
It’s hard to win one championship, whether it be in the college or professional ranks. But USC coach Jovan Vavic has directed the men’s water polo team to three consecutive national championships. Vavic also became the first coach to win three straight National Coach of the Year awards.
Although the Trojans were selected to finish fourth in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, USC compiled a 28-2 record, while becoming the sixth USC team to win three straight national titles.

The USC women’s water polo team is set to begin this weekend’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament as a No. 5 seed, and it will first face No. 4-seeded UCLA on Friday at 1:30 p.m. at San Jose State’s Aquatics Center.
Pressure · Senior driver Joelle Bezhazi has led the team all season and now, going into the MPSF tournament, she will be heavily relied upon. -  Daily Trojan file photo 
Last year, the Women of Troy lost in the championship game of the tournament, but did  eventually win an NCAA title by beating Stanford 10-9 in a heated matchup.
This time, however, the defending national champions have lost some of that luster by finishing with three losses in the conference play — the most since 2000. Nonetheless, the team remains confident in pursuit of a mirroring its success of just a season ago.
“We’re feeling a lot more confident,” said senior driver Joelle Bekhazi. “We were prepared last time, but we’re more prepared this time and we’re going to be a whole new team going into the MPSF tournament. The last two weeks we’ve been really working hard, and I have a great feeling about this week.”
It is no surprise the loss of big- name seniors such as goalie Tumua Anae, utility Forel Davies and two-meter Kami Craig have adversely impacted the team’s performance in 2011, but with its own stable group of veterans, this year’s group is set to begin postseason play.
With a roster littered with newcomers such as freshmen two-meters Kaleigh Gilchrist and Maddie Rosenthal, who have recorded 13 and 16 goals, respectively, USC will instead heavily on its veteran core.
“Being a veteran, I have to do a good job in leading the team and show them that during the playoffs, you have to play with the ‘now it’s do or die’ mentality,” Bekhazi said. “The older girls have to play by example and play their hearts out and hopefully the newer girls will follow and it will give the team more energy and excitement.”
During the conference tournament, the Women of Troy also have the opportunity to prove why they are a different team than last year’s bunch, carving out their own identity in the hope of notching an MPSF championship, as well as an NCAA title down the line.
“The key is playing as a unit and playing together and converting our 6-on-5,” Bekhazi said. “We’re always working on our team chemistry, and that’s what sets up apart from other teams. We work hard in and out of the water, and hopefully all our hard work will pay off this weekend.”
The key to success this weekend for the Women of Troy will be based largely on the performance of their defense, which has struggled at times.
“We have been working on defense and being more committed to our defense and not allowing them to get easy goals on us and our 5-on-6 and fast break defense,” Bekhazi said.

Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll had waited 12 years for his return to the professional ranks.
But while Carroll, who served as the USC coach from 2001-2009, is hoping to reshape his NFL image in Seattle after going 33-31 in six seasons with the Jets and Patriots, he has also sought to maintain his ties with USC and the Los Angeles communities during his first year at his new gig in the Emerald City.
Fighting on · Even while working for the Seahawks, Carroll has maintained his work with his community outreach program, A Better LA, which he founded while at USC in 2003. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Most notably, Carroll has continued his work with his nonprofit organization, A Better LA, which he founded in 2003.
“It’s a great program,” Carroll said. “It has been for years and years and it always will be. We have really always cherished the support from our fans and students.”
Carroll, as well as other community leaders, originally formed A Better LA in an effort to combat prevalent gang violence within the Los Angeles area.
Yet, despite moving 1,400 miles up the Interstate 5 to Seattle, Carroll has vowed to keep his program alive and well.
“The leadership is very strong,” Carroll said. “It’s a very challenging time, of course, and we need the help to keep this thing going, but it has received a ton of support from the university community. That, along, with individuals and their big commitment and tremendous need, kept us together and working successfully.”
In an effort to combat the change in locale, Carroll has relied on the support of USC Athletic Director Pat Haden, among other local figures, in an effort to promote his mission: scaling back violent crime to promote safer neighborhoods throughout the Southland.
“We’re creating a model of how you can successfully dwindle community violence with a minimal amount of funds and money backing it up,” Carroll said. “We can get a community to be a safer area where kids can come from their schools and back and forth, feel more comfortable and enjoy being in their community.”
The genesis for Carroll’s effort to reduce inner-city violence in Los Angeles came in 2003 after tragedy struck near the USC campus, on Figueroa Street. As Carroll remembers it, he stumbled upon a police report detailing the deaths of 11 teenagers in a span of just a few days. It did not sit right with the Trojans’ headman.
“It just stuck with me,” Carroll said recounting the incident. “I had to see if I could something about helping the situation, making the streets a safer place to live. We had to put something together.”
In the weeks that followed, Carroll looked to do as much, working alongside Lou and Diane Tice, co-founders of The Pacific Institute, an educational program, to launch A Better LA in an attempt to reduce violence in the communities surrounding USC.
Carroll and the Tices reached out to other inner-city groups, namely Common Unity Reaching Everyone, a program focused on scaling back gang violence in West Athens, one of the more violent gang territories.
Thus far, Carroll has been more than pleased with the progress.
“We found the ability to see people come together,” Carroll said. “We’ve only been a part of it. I have never come out and said, ‘We have done this on our own.’ We have been in the middle of this great surge that has really changed the landscape of the number of violent crimes and murders in this area.”
And they haven’t halted events since Carroll’s departure.
Recently, A Better LA and the Trojan Knights co-hosted a field trip to bring students from CURE to the USC-Long Beach State baseball game Tuesday.
In using Los Angeles as a model, the 59-year-old coach hopes to bring similar programs to other cities in the country, including Seattle.
“That’s in the works right now,” Carroll said. “I don’t think there’s any reason to think otherwise. We have already seen the diligent and work of the outreach program. We’re certain we can do that in other places, as well as L.A.”
But at a time when Carroll has changed jobs and the majority of USC fans are preoccupied with the problems plaguing their own athletic program — namely NCAA sanctions and a declining on-field product ­— momentum for the former coach’s community outreach program has slowed since its height in 2008, when it was profiled by the Emmy-award winning television program 60 Minutes.
Carroll nonetheless urges fans to stick with not only A Better LA, but the football program as well.
“We need them again,” Carroll said. “We need them again this year to stay with the program, as we get it right and get back on top of stuff. It’s easy to support when you’re winning. This is still the time for everybody to rally, go to the games, have fun, watch spring practice, do everything you can to support it and make the experience what it can be.”
This was an excellent draft for several reasons. Schneider and Carroll had a great draft in their first year, and look to expand on their success. This year, the emphasis was on offensive line, linebacker, receiver, and defensive back, all areas where GM John Schneider has had success with prospects such as Donald Driver, Mark Tauscher, Scott Wells, Sam Shields, and Clay Matthews. 
James Carpenter- Alabama- B+
Carpenter is a great addition, but the Seahawks attempted to trade down and select him 4-5 picks later, the Packers were reportedly very interested in him.
John Moffitt- Wisconsin- A 
The Seahawks traded down and selected him, they stayed true to their draft board and fortified the right side of the offensive line.
In Carpenter and Moffitt, the Seahawks picked up two large, brutish, bruising, mean, nasty, physical,tough, durable lineman to stabilize their O-Line. Between Okung, Gibson, Unger, Moffitt, and Carpenter, the Seahawks should have a great offensive line for the future with Spencer, Ray Willis, and possibly Stacy Andrews providing depth.
K.J Wright- Mississippi State- B+
Wright will be a great pass rusher, but Outside Linebacker is not a glaring need. However, drafting him also enables the Seahawks to allow Aaron Curry to play more naturally in Nickel packages. 
The Seahawks also drafted K.J Wright, a speedy linebacker with great coverage and blitzing skills, and no glaring negatives to his game. The only reason he dropped was for taking poor angles and playing a little high at times. He projects to be an excellent pass rusher in the Seahawk’s Nickel package and also a great linebacker in coverage. He has potential to develop into an Elvis Dumervil type Strong Side linebacker, as he has similar intangibles and weighs three more pounds than Dumervil, but also had a better shuttle and 40 time. 
Kris Durham- Georgia- B 
Durham, a receiver, looks to potentially start across from Mike Williams, and has huge upside potential. However, the Seahawks most likely drafted him a little too early. 
Durham was overshadowed by top NFL Draft prospect A.J Green for much of the season. However, when A.J Green was suspended for the first four games, Durham had the most productive stretch of his career. At 6-5, 216 pounds with a 4.46 yard dash. His biggest weakness is his burst off the line of scrimmage, but he has high potential to develop into a possession receiver guy who can line up as a slot receiver, run slant patterns with his large, physical frame. He could be a surprisingly productive edition to the Hawk’s receiving corps in 2011.
Richard Sherman- Stanford A- 
Sherman is a speedy, athletic corner with a tall build that is good at tracking and covering receivers, but needs to work on tracking the ball. However, Sherman can improve on this and has immense potential as he only has one season of experience playing at corner. The Seahawks had an outstanding amount of success with their bandit packages until their secondary was hit by a plethora of injuries, and Sherman also looks to provide depth. At 6-2, he has great height and looks to be a nickel back, with potential to supplant Marcus Trufant as starter.
Mark Legree- Appalachian State- A+
Legree led the country in interceptions with 22, and is a ball hawk with great instincts and (obviously) ball location. He had an excellent short shuttle of 4.09, a great 3 cone time of 6.09 and 22 bench press reps, which is great for a safety. He is excellent against the run, and if he can be half as good against the pass in the NFL, he will be an excellent safety. However, the Seahawks already have an excellent free safety in Earl Thomas, and if Legree fulfills his potential, he may be able to supplant Thomas, with Thomas moving to Cornerback. In 2011, Legree looks to start at strong safety and be a Bob Sanders type player. Legree went under the radar a bit, and wasn’t even invited to the combine, with numbers coming from his pro day. He has been praised by Mike Mayock among other “experts.” The Seahawks might have found themselves a steal in the Appalachian State alumni. Best pick the Seahawks had all day. 
Byron Maxwell- Clemson- B+
Maxwell is another tall Cornerback with a good build. He plays physically, and is a great tackler. He is a great zone defender, with 33.5 inch arms. He reads and reacts well, but is only an average man-to man Corner. He had 26 bench press reps, a great number for a Corner Back. However, his college production was not excellent, but the intangibles are great. However, if he improves his man coverage, he is also a potential starter. The Seahawks had an outstanding amount of success with their bandit packages until their secondary was hit by a plethora of injuries, and Maxwell also looks to provide solid depth. In 2011, he looks to play in dime and bandit packages.
Lazarius Levington- LSU- B
A large defensive lineman who can play end or tackle, but looks to play end in the NFL, Lazarius Levington is a large, wide-bodied lineman who carries his weight well. He has a great first step and changes direction well. He holds a point well, and is a solid run defender, but needs to become more instinctive to transition this to the pros. Levington doesn’t offer much in terms of a pass rush. He looks to offer the Seahawks depth for Brandon Mebane, Colin Cole, and Red Bryant. If he can improve his instincts, he can eventually develop into a starter. In 2011, he looks to be a solid backup and rotational end on rushing downs.
Malcolm Smith- USC- B
In Smith, the Seahawks got an athletic freak of an Outside Linebacker. With a 39″ vertical, 4.4 40 time, 7.08 3-Cone time, and 28 bench reps, Smith has all the tools for the next level. Smith has good instincts, but lacks physicality and isn’t great at pursuing. However, he is speedy and good at dropping into coverage. He does a great job of covering tight ends and receivers. In 2011, he looks to contribute on special teams and occasionally rotate in at Weakside Linebacker. 
Overall Seahawks draft grade- A
The Seahawks have completely rebuilt their Offensive Line and Secondary the past two years. John Schneider and Pete Carroll look to continue their success with another seemingly great draft.
This was an excellent draft for several reasons. Schneider and Carroll had a great draft in their first year, and look to expand on their success. This year, the emphasis was on offensive line, linebacker, receiver, and defensive back, all areas where GM John Schneider has had success with prospects such as Donald Driver, Mark Tauscher, Scott Wells, Sam Shields, and Clay Matthews. 
James Carpenter- Alabama- B+
Carpenter is a great addition, but the Seahawks attempted to trade down and select him 4-5 picks later, the Packers were reportedly very interested in him.
John Moffitt- Wisconsin- A 
The Seahawks traded down and selected him, they stayed true to their draft board and fortified the right side of the offensive line.
In Carpenter and Moffitt, the Seahawks picked up two large, brutish, bruising, mean, nasty, physical,tough, durable lineman to stabilize their O-Line. Between Okung, Gibson, Unger, Moffitt, and Carpenter, the Seahawks should have a great offensive line for the future with Spencer, Ray Willis, and possibly Stacy Andrews providing depth.
K.J Wright- Mississippi State- B+
Wright will be a great pass rusher, but Outside Linebacker is not a glaring need. However, drafting him also enables the Seahawks to allow Aaron Curry to play more naturally in Nickel packages. 
The Seahawks also drafted K.J Wright, a speedy linebacker with great coverage and blitzing skills, and no glaring negatives to his game. The only reason he dropped was for taking poor angles and playing a little high at times. He projects to be an excellent pass rusher in the Seahawk’s Nickel package and also a great linebacker in coverage. He has potential to develop into an Elvis Dumervil type Strong Side linebacker, as he has similar intangibles and weighs three more pounds than Dumervil, but also had a better shuttle and 40 time. 
Kris Durham- Georgia- B 
Durham, a receiver, looks to potentially start across from Mike Williams, and has huge upside potential. However, the Seahawks most likely drafted him a little too early. 
Durham was overshadowed by top NFL Draft prospect A.J Green for much of the season. However, when A.J Green was suspended for the first four games, Durham had the most productive stretch of his career. At 6-5, 216 pounds with a 4.46 yard dash. His biggest weakness is his burst off the line of scrimmage, but he has high potential to develop into a possession receiver guy who can line up as a slot receiver, run slant patterns with his large, physical frame. He could be a surprisingly productive edition to the Hawk’s receiving corps in 2011.
Richard Sherman- Stanford A- 
Sherman is a speedy, athletic corner with a tall build that is good at tracking and covering receivers, but needs to work on tracking the ball. However, Sherman can improve on this and has immense potential as he only has one season of experience playing at corner. The Seahawks had an outstanding amount of success with their bandit packages until their secondary was hit by a plethora of injuries, and Sherman also looks to provide depth. At 6-2, he has great height and looks to be a nickel back, with potential to supplant Marcus Trufant as starter.
Mark Legree- Appalachian State- A+
Legree led the country in interceptions with 22, and is a ball hawk with great instincts and (obviously) ball location. He had an excellent short shuttle of 4.09, a great 3 cone time of 6.09 and 22 bench press reps, which is great for a safety. He is excellent against the run, and if he can be half as good against the pass in the NFL, he will be an excellent safety. However, the Seahawks already have an excellent free safety in Earl Thomas, and if Legree fulfills his potential, he may be able to supplant Thomas, with Thomas moving to Cornerback.

Just stumbled onto this over at fetchheadlines.com. I’m glad to see that Carroll’s keeping involved with this program…it’s a force for good in a deeply troubled city.

Were kids just as mean 50 years ago as they were today?  The quote “It has often been said that children are cruel” is displayed at the beginning of That’s What I Am, a remarkable, uplifting exploration of a boy’s journey to manhood amongst the discrimination and trials of a 1960s middle-school.
Written and directed by Mike Pavone, That’s What I Am tells the story of 12-year-old Andy Nichol (Chase Ellison) who is paired with a social outcast for a group project. The outcast, known as “Big G,” (Alexander Walters) is a too-tall, big-eared red head with a geeky demeanor.  The pairing, engineered by beloved teacher Mr. Simon (Ed Harris), facilitates Andy’s journey into the geek world, and sets him off on a wild journey of discovery.
After a dramatic school-yard fight, a boy is suspended after being caught by Mr. Simon.  The boy’s father retaliates with a vicious rumor about Mr. Simon’s sexuality. Meanwhile, Big G gathers the courage to confront a school bully. Amidst all these happenings, Andy attempts to survive middle school, get his first kiss, and learn about dignity from an unlikely source: Big G.
That’s What I Am deals with some intense subjects, bullying, prejudice and discrimination, but maintains a humor and a light heart that is central to the film’s success. Nevertheless, we encounter several different forms of bullying in the film, in several different age groups. Big G is subjected to daily ridicule, due to his awkward appearance and geeky demeanor. Other school children are bullied throughout the film.  Mr. Simon is baselessly accused of being a homosexual by an angry parent.  We are reminded that bullying is not age-specific, and that the consequences can be severe for all involved.
This is a film with definite morals, but it delivers them without seeming preachy.  One of film’s central messages is summarized in a phrase created by Mr. Simon.  Mr. Simon entered a local newspaper contest to summarize the way to peace in 25 words or less, and his winning four-word answer was “Human Dignity + Compassion = Peace.”
This road to peace runs through the emotional center of the film.
When Mr. Simon is accused of being a homosexual, he refuses to even dignify the question of his sexuality with an answer, even though it makes the situation more difficult.  Mr. Simon stands by his morals and demonstrates remarkable dignity—setting the tone for the rest of the film.
 
Although he is picked on the most in school, Big G is also the biggest kid. Even though Big G could be a bully and comes close to hurting a few of the meaner kids in the school, he always restrains himself.  He never abandons his moral base, even as he is pelted with insults and never stoops to the level of his torturers.  Both characters also display remarkable compassion. When learning of the allegations against him, Mr. Simon feels only compassion for his accusers. Big G never truly judges any of his torturers.
Helping the story along is a spot-on 1960s atmosphere that sucks us straight into the film and into the period right away. Bowties, tucked-in shirts and outdated hair styles adorn the screen, and even short-shorts make an appearance. A few well-placed bowler hats, and several even more well-placed vintage cars help set the period and prepare us to deal with the racism and homophobia of a different time period.
This film also perfectly encapsulates the awkward innocence of middle school; the young actors of the film never waver in their convincing portrayal of middle school awkwardness. That’s What I Am is also sure to inspire nostalgia in every audience member.  While this film will certainly not spark the same memories for every viewer, memories of awkward first kisses and awkward physical changes will surely come up.
This tender coming-of-age film will live or die with its smallest cast members, and That’s What I Am soars. It is an inspiring testament to integrity, compassion and the power of the human spirit.  Warm, inspiring and, above all, honest, That’s What I Am is powered by a surprisingly good young cast that is anchored with an amazing performance from Harris.  The acting is believable, and the student-teacher dynamic is portrayed perfectly.
 That’s What I Am shows that bullying can come at all ages and in many different forms.  However, this film also shows that dignity and compassion can be found even in the youngest people among us.  Coming-of-age doesn’t necessarily mean becoming a mature, respectable person.  That’s What I Am demonstrates that one can never be too young to embark on the path to peace.
That’s What I Am hits theaters on April 29.

The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team is primed to continue its run in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament Thursday, as it hosts No. 2 UC Irvine in a semifinal match at the Galen Center. at 7:30 p.m.
The Trojans (22-2, 20-2) have enjoyed success against the Anteaters (19-11, 14-8) as of late, winning the last four matches.
But the Anteaters have improved significantly during the last stretch of the season.
Irvine, which is the No. 4 seed, is the next highest ranked team left in the MPSF tournament after both No. 2 BYU and No. 3 Stanford were upset in the first round.
Irvine’s strength lies in its serving, leading the conference in serving aces through most of the year. The Anteaters have also developed from a bottom-feeder blocking team into one of the top blocking teams in the conference during the last stretch of the season.
“At this point in the season, there’s fewer wrinkles in strategy and more emphasis on execution,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “It’s natural that they improve their blocking.”
The match is an opportunity for playoff redemption, as UC Irvine eliminated USC in a 2008 play-in match and in 2009 in the national title match.
“We were just coming of age back then,” Ferguson said. “They had a lot of All-American upperclassmen back then and our main guys were just sophomores. We’ve grown up a lot since then. It’s a whole different matchup.”
This season, the Trojans are tops in the conference in nearly every statistical category both offensively and defensively.
Irvine’s offense and serving rank third and first in the conference, respectively. The Anteaters’ outside hitter-centric offense relies on quick outside sets. What they lack in a strong middle attack is remedied by their ability to find holes and single blocks to hit through before the defense can be set.
Opposite Carson Clark ranks second in the conference in kills and points overall. Outside hitter Corey Yoder was an All-MPSF First-Teamer and outside hitter Jordan DuFault is a two-time All American.
As evidenced by the last four matches, however, the Trojans are unfazed by the Anteater attack.
“It doesn’t matter who they have,” said junior middle blocker Steven Shandrick. “We’re so big, physical and smart as blockers and defenders that if we execute, we can outplay anyone.”
Most recently, the Trojans won an electric first-round matchup in postseason play against No. 8 UCLA. The Bruins made a last-second lineup change and the Trojans were sucked into chronic mistakes in the first game, but they eventually regained their composure and won the match in convincing fashion.
“It was good to get our first playoff win under our belts,” said senior setter Riley McKibbin. “We’re carrying in a lot of momentum from the end of the season and we’re ready for the next step.”

We see them in piles at the grocery store, on our kitchen counters, atop our cereal, but for many plantation workers in Nicaragua, daily exposure to bananas has had a much more profound impact on their lives.
Swedish filmmaker Fredrik Gertten’s Bananas! artfully relates the true stories of a handful of these plantation workers as they battle the Dole Food Co. in court.
Represented by famed Los Angeles lawyer Juan “Accidentes” Dominguez, the workers sued Dole for using a pesticide known as Nemagon on its bananas in Nicaragua during the 1970s, even after the chemical was banned in other countries across the world.
Though the chemical has been proven to cause a wide range of health issues, Dominguez chose to focus on the cases in which exposure to the chemical caused sterility.
As the film follows Dominguez’s journey through Nicaragua to talk to some of the affected Dole workers first-hand and subsequently fight for their rights, it also provides a very intimate look at the heart-wrenching circumstances and stories of the employees that were unknowingly exposed to the harmful chemicals.
By piecing together recent interviews with Nicaraguan men, women and children and footage of what went on at the country’s banana plantations more than 30 years ago, Gertten is able to shed light on a side of the global food industry that many do not know exists.
He shows machinery fumigating the fields with the toxic chemicals, the formula dripping into puddles that the workers would then walk through barefoot, as well as men pulling hordes of bananas across fields with a cable tied around their waist.  He shows men talking about how they always wanted to have children, but weren’t able to after working on the plantations and women who miscarried or bore babies with fatal birth defects as a result of their direct contact with the chemical.
Yet, as many of the Nicaraguans attest both in their conversations with Dominguez and in court, they were never warned about the potential harmful effects of exposure to Nemagon by the Dole authorities, nor were they instructed about how to protect themselves from these effects.
It is this injustice that Gertten captures so vividly and effectively throughout the film.  He does so, however, in a very fair, well-balanced manner.
As he intersperses footage from inside the courtroom with scenes of Nicaraguan heartbreak, he makes sure to include several scenes in which some of the plantation workers on the stand give a different story than they gave in their deposition, as pointed out by the opposing attorneys.  Viewers, then, are able to decide whether or not the plaintiffs suing Dole are telling the truth, much like the jury in the film does.
Also very effective throughout the film is the inclusion of the in-court testimonies of David DeLorenzo, President and CEO of Dole Food Co., whose involvement with the case runs deep as he was actually stationed in Nicaragua during the ’70s.  Though he is confronted with the issue multiple times in his cross examination, DeLorenzo is repeatedly unable to provide a valid reason for continuing the use of Nemagon on the Nicaraguan banana plantations after it was banned elsewhere.
While the initial ruling that was made on the 12 featured court cases is included in the film, Gertten is very careful to inform viewers that the issue is by no means closed.  Rather than depicting a resolution at the film’s end, the director makes it clear that neither the thousands of Nicaraguan workers affected by the toxic pesticides nor Dominguez are done fighting to right the Dole Food Co.’s wrongful actions.
Through his intelligently crafted documentary, Gertten not only tells a powerful story about the negligence of a large corporation in protecting the health of its employees, but he brings attention to an important issue that might make people think twice before picking up their next bunch of bananas or carton of juice with the name “Dole” on it.

How does one go about listening to post-rock instrumental band Explosions in the Sky’s new album, Take Care, Take Care, Take Care?
There’s a lot of answers to that question.  But a quality pair of headphones or good speakers is key, as is a solid chunk of time to hear as much of the album as possible.  A drink or two – the kind that you savor, not chug – wouldn’t hurt, either.
That’s because the music of EITS isn’t really the sort of thing you just listen to for entertainment, like you might with some artists you hear on the radio.  Ever since their debut album, 2000’s How Strange, Innocence, EITS has specialized in the kind of introspective, hypnotic instrumental rock that makes you think of quiet bus rides at night or one-man road trips through the Midwest.  Their formula of flowing buildups and crashing rock climaxes anchored by minimalist clean guitar licks has worked for them, and in many ways they continue this basic formula in their latest album.
However, something has changed in Take Care, Take Care, Take Care.  Previous albums, most notably their stellar 2003 offering The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place, had a grand sense of space, airiness and a sort of crystalline clarity to the recordings.  Take Care, however, experiments with densely layered, heavier-hitting compositions that attack more with the weight of a sledgehammer rather than the sharpness of a blade.
The album’s second track, “Trembling Hands”, is a perfect example of this shift in style.  It starts in a recognizable way, with a simple, repeating guitar melody.  But almost immediately, it jumps into a hectic mixture of vocal chants, snare drum rolls and layer upon layer of nearly indistinguishable stacks of guitar.  The main riffing motif remains essentially constant for nearly a minute and a half before finally transitioning into a new melodic idea.
This is not the swaying, drifting playing of earlier Explosions in the Sky compositions, which tended to roll like waves from one musical concept to another throughout songs.  And while repetitive melodies seemed to work in with a sort of meditative aura before, some parts within Take Care’s pieces can be overbearing, like an angry child trying to make a point.  “Enough, I get it!” you might cry.  But it may still be another two minutes before something really new happens, like with the crashing first third of the album opener, “Last Known Surroundings”.
Of course, there are things the band has always been good at, and these traits remain here to various extents.  The music, as a whole, is epic and cinematic and packed to the brim with little sound effects and instrumental touches, which is why good speakers or headphones are borderline mandatory.  And for the most part, the songs themselves aren’t all overpowering – rather, it’s notable bits and pieces here and there and everywhere that can drag like there’s no tomorrow.
In fact, not paying attention is the best way to enjoy Take Care.  Paying close attention and analyzing the music can actually, via some bizarre irony, hinder the experience – there’s just sections that might be outright boring under close observation.
Take Care, though, can seem brilliant when you’re zoning out, letting the reverb-laden guitars play out like the soundtrack to your slow-paced Friday night in.  This is also where that aforementioned drink can come into play: sink into a couch, close your eyes and let time pass you by.
But for all its faults, Take Care leaves hints that EITS’s newfound experimentation may, after all, work out quite well with a little more time and tweaking.  The finale track, “Let Me Back In”, is debatably the best track on Take Care, with a dynamic, clever soundscape that integrates what sounds like garbled speech with delicately strummed chords and sharp, echoing stabs of electronic groans.
Quiet yet explosive, and with a near-perfect blend of beautiful musicality and avant-garde inventiveness, it’s everything that Take Care, Take Care, Take Care could – and should – have been.
Unfortunate, then, that Explosions in the Sky only really hits their stride in the final ten minutes of the album.

Not too long ago, Amanda Jo Williams was a mother of two who performed in Woodstock before coming to Los Angeles to gather a solid fan base.
Although she’s been given the reputation of a sad, lonely mother who has suddenly made it big, the magical-sounding freak folk singer rejects this, saying in an interview for OBEY clothing, “I didn’t feel like a poor, young, mother, all miserable and crap, that some reviewers make it seem like. I was a strong thing like I am now still, never letting my circumstances confine me.” Her attitude toward her life is very much like that toward her music: Williams walks to the beat of her own drum.
Williams’ upcoming album, Mary’s Big Feet, is like listening to a little girl sing about the mystical woodland creatures that she sees in her sleep. Although Williams is now often referred to as a “Los Angeles-based singer,” the singer is from a variety of places whose histories come across in her music. Her time spent in Woodstock, New York was spurred by her interest in the free-wheeling singers who flocked to the area in the 1960s, but the most obvious influence on her music is her Southern childhood spent in Hogsville, Georgia, a small town that was once a plantation.
Songs like “I Am Just a Country Girl” and “Hunka Hunka Hoo Hoo” sound like tracks off of a country record from the 1930s, while “The Bear Eats Me” is like a little girl’s warning about the swampy woods behind her house. While her acclaimed album Yes I Will, Mr. Man is a rollickingly fun country album, Mary’s Big Feet is more stripped-down and introspective.
Instead of recording in a stationary studio, Mary’s Big Feet was recorded all over the country — wherever Amanda Jo could find a quiet room to record a song during her travels. The songs on the album range from the dark “The Bear Eats Me” to the incredibly childlike “Blue Toy Airplane,” a duet between Williams and one of her children. Yet this is arguably one of the more annoying songs I’ve heard in my life; her childlike voice, which can sometimes come across as a fun theatrical technique, in this song is at its most over-the-top and artifical.
Some of Williams’ tracks, such as “Waiting For You,” are almost irresistible, while “Die You” and “Doo Bi” are overly grainy home recordings that aptly feel like they’ve been pulled out of the fog of a dream.
While the lyrics aren’t necessarily original, “Wait For You” and “Die You” are two songs that benefit by from Williams’ simple and beautiful melodies, rather than from her theatrical voice. For those who are not as open to listening to Amanda Jo’s more experimental music, songs like “Why Don’t You Loo Me,” are hard to listen to, especially when Williams makes scary, cat-like noises that hinder an already melodically uninteresting song.
You will either love her or find her completely appalling. It seems that for now, however, Amanda Jo has found a willing crowd, as proven by her monthlong residency at the landmark hipster hangout The Echo.
Williams has been applauded for being different and wholley unique, but what once were original sounds are now becoming fallbacks of the genre.
Williams’ Mary’s Big Feet is already being reviewed as an original and authentic piece of art, but the theatrics of her childlike voice and the subject matter of which she sings about seem to be a fixture of freak folk and a current trend in the music scene, and therefore, nothing new.
Although you won’t find any overproduction or auto-tuning on this album, you also won’t find anything entirely authentic.
 
2 stars
The thing about people who listen to music as an art form not a heart form is that their ears become desensitized to sentiment over time. They become overly tuned to a certain way of receiving and critiquing sound and lose touch with the whole point of music. Can we please refresh our memories with a few definitions here? 1. ORIGINAL: A) belonging or pertaining to the origin or beginning of something; B) an original work, writing, or the like, as opposed to any copy or imitation. And 2. AUTHENTIC: not false or copied; genuine; real.
Just because something may not sound original to a listener’s ears does not mean that the music is not a genuine reflection of the artist’s origin. Joanna Newsom has been doing her thing for ages just as Amanda has. Now that Amanda is gathering momentum and buzz it is easy for people to want to condense her whole existence into a mere “trend” and compare or link her to musicians whose names were more widely recognized first. While others’ names may precede her in terms of acknowledgment, we should straighten out this time-line a little bit… Amanda’s songs have been inspiring people for a decade, before anyone had heard of Joanna Newsom, Devendra Banhart, etc.
I love Joanna Newsom. And I love Amanda Jo Williams. I respect them both for doing what they do, starting from back when their music was for nobody but themself to the present moment at which it is available to the masses. It seems appropriate to say that fans of Artist A would be likely to appreciate the music of Artist B and vice versa, and in that way, yes, Amanda Jo is able to serve fans within a particular music “scene.” However, in a similar logic to two wrongs not making a right, I wouldn’t say two unique voices make either one less unique. They each stand alone and should be appreciated for what they are. A voice is no different from hair color or eyesight in the sense that we are given what we are born with, although the option to alter it exists if we so choose. To touch on that freedom, can Amanda play up her voice for a specific chorus or character? Sure (e.g. Heraseema Sara). But can she play it down? No. What you hear is her plain and simple. Speak to her (though be forewarned she’s shy) and you will hear that that is her god-given voice. If you were a fly on the wall and heard her speak in her dreams at night that is the voice you would hear. Just hear her giggle and you will feel her purity. 
Amanda Jo Williams is a simple gal who keeps it natural inside and out. She doesn’t hide or fake her accent, nor does she use auto-tune or fancy recording equipment or techniques, so indeed they are gritty. If you want to over-analyze that reality and call it pretension or a contrived response to a trend I analogize this absurd suggestion: next time you’re about to doodle randomly on a piece of paper, cap the pen. Suppress the urge to scribble that something until you can afford to create the unborn image however small, random, or silly in a professional artist studio that costs a fortune. Then return to what you were about to draw if you can even still remember and see if it comes out anything the same as it would have when it was FREE, in both usages of the word. Amanda’s songs are raw. Her songs are her heart on a plate. And whether served warm or cold, never doubt that they are served spontaneously (thank you laptop for always being a click away!). Garageband is her diary. Most of the songs on this record are improvised one-take doo-das. What for her may be an emotional release to press record and just GO (side-note: I dare you to press record and see what comes out of you for 2 minutes straight without stopping) we now get to keep as (pseudo-voyeuristic) treasures– her heartbeats compressed into mp3s, so thank you Heyday Publishing for that.
When people hear music like Amanda’s they don’t know what exactly to do with it aside from attempt to label it, but they don’t know what, so they just call it whatever they call everything else that made them react this same way. Such as “freak folk” which came about as a term to peg Devendra Banhart’s music when it first hit the streets in a big way and people needed to coin a name to spit the game. He never liked that term. Who would? What does it even mean? And yet here people are still taking cheap short-cuts with words instead of truly reviewing the subject at large. What is the merit in regurgitating these terms and popular names despite their lack of relevance or influence on the actual subject here, which is supposedly Amanda Jo Williams: a woman who even the (seemingly undecided and contradictory) author admits walks to the beat of her own drum? And that she does. She may have a facebook account and enjoy a cupcake or a game of pool in a bar, but she’s about as off the grid as it gets for a modern woman in 2011. In the reality outside of the music biz pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey game of genre match-up, Amanda’s life coexists alternately and individually from the aforementioned folks and/or scene. So if all we’re going to allow ourselves to judge her by is the surface of her songs, let’s remember that her songs are tokens and snapshots from her life, her real life. The one she’s been living since she was an angel-faced horse-riding, basketball-playing, tractor-riding bumpkin in Georgia.
Unlike hearing someone robot-burping about a G6 or downing shots at a club, when we hear someone’s music as intimate as Amanda’s we are taking a mini trip into their life, a hike in their shoes. And as opposed to the dainty shoes you might find on Ms. Newsom’s feet or whatever the hip trend you might find on Mr. Banhart’s toes, I can guarantee on Ms. Williams’ feet you will probably find big old soccer cleats or something of the like. If you’ve had the privilege of meeting Amanda you know she is a rare rocket who will blow your mind, in the gentlest, sweetest way possible, like a snow globe. She is a teardrop of fire baked in a fluffy cloud. She is a nurturer, a mother not just to her own children. She is an old soul and she is true to herself always and forever. For those who gravitate towards her light and hop on for the ride, the unity she inspires among us really is beautiful. But as for everyone else too busy listening to actually hear, suit yourself. To quote one of my favorite songs of hers, “it doesn’t matter if you come or go.” She’s flying high on a different type of plane.
Dear Joce,
Amanda is a mother of three, and she’s from Hogansville. She’s not copying anyone. I love Amanda’s voice, and don’t see anything but a superficial resemblance to JN, who has a different approach and style. They resemble one another only to the extent that either may resemble any other contemporary.
Best,
Janey
Amanda Jo Williams does not sound like Joanna Newsom at all! What are you smokin?!
Ms. Geoghan had apparently not heard or heard of Amanda Jo Williams before cramming for this review, as evidenced by the inaccuracies in her piece (Hogsville, mother of two, made it big, et al). It may be difficult for a jaded reviewer to accept that someone as unique and wholly organic as AJW is not putting on an act, or assuming a genre stance. Be assured: She’s just doing what comes natural. Of course it’s not for everybody. Cutting edge art never is.
I’ve been a fan of Amanda Jo Williams for awhile now and I can attest to the fact that she is a mother of two and she is from Hogsville. Even though I love her music, though, i’ll be the first to admit that it’s so not original…just copying what ms. newsom’s been doing for awhile now
A friend turned me on to miss Amanda Jo last nite and her new album “mary’s big feet” whew, I was taken back at first. Then found myself completely falling into the spontaneity of her sound. Pure beauty. Have never heard anything quite like it.
grow some tits, G
If you are going to claim this isn’t authentic or new, then name someone else who has something like it. I can’t think of any female singer right now who is like this.freak folk or not. But would love to see how you can substantiate that big claim. also, her voice isn’t an act or a theatrical choice. That’s her natural voice.

A musky July evening.
The sound of castanets flutters through the air. A red scarf descends to the floor. A single breath dances from your lips, you feel your lover’s heart quaking like the crusts of Vesuvius and somewhere, beyond many seas and mountains, a child is born.
There’s nothing quite like a summer fling, especially when the temperature outside skyrockets to dehydrating levels. Don’t let a night with that special someone end with Gatorade and a fast immersion in a bathtub of ice. You can keep cool and keep the future sexy with these five svelte beers, crisper than a bin of arugula and brewed with amorous care.
Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse — Franziskaner Weissbier Brewery, Munich
In college quantities, alcohol turns the body to putty. But when used sparingly, it can set off fireworks in one’s central nervous system. Franziskaner’s classic Hefe-Weisse is a delicate brew, light as a Cornish game hen but boasting enough bitter hops and accents of lemon zest to curl one’s toes. 
On a broiling summer night, there’s no cooler comfort than this Munich import. If you’re feeling extra ambitious, pour the Hefe-Weisse into a wide beer glass.
It will bring out the flavors more sharply, not to mention the air of Roger Moore sophistication.
Climax Cream Ale — Climax Brewing Company, Roselle Park, CAlif.
A beer so provocatively named should be a disappointment waiting to happen, but the exquisite Cream Ale from Roselle Park’s Climax Brewing Company is a hazy delight.
A deep shade of gold when poured, the brew is as soft as a gossamer pillow but rounded out with momentary highlights of green apple and citrusy hops.
The beer is so similar in taste to a Belgian white ale that the “cream” here seems more opportunism than brewing by-product.
St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout — McAuslan Brewing, Montréal, Quebec
You’ve got to hand it to the Québécois. First they revive electrofunk with the onslaught of Chromeo, and now, they’ve crafted one of the most salacious beers this side of Le Chateau Frontenac.
Though one would not typically lace a seduction with the words “oatmeal” or “stout,” this St. Ambroise brew is a firestorm of wheat and dark chocolates, the latter a classic aphrodisiac.
Straddling that fine line between bitter and butter-sweet, the St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout is a rejuvenating experience and a classier alternative to a heart-shaped box of stale candies.
Three  Philosophers Belgian Style Quadrupel — Brewery Ommegang, Cooperstown, NY
A must for brewers yeast connoisseurs, this strapping Belgian ale comes packed with enough starter to bake a load of sourdough and enough cherries for one of George Washington’s mythic pies.
Although it’s brewed and bottled on the western side of the pond, the Three Philosophers is as earthy and fruity as Seville’s finest sangria, only colder. It even comes with a cork, perfect for a dramatic, post-coital uncapping.
Like the Franziskaner, this one is best enjoyed out of the bottle, with sips of tantric patience.
Royal Virility Performance — Brewdog, Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire
This is the next best thing to a front-row seat for Prince William and Kate Middleton’s impending nuptials. In honor of the soon-to-be newlyweds, the beer masochists at Scotland’s Brewdog (who tazed our taste buds with Sink The Bismarck and Nuclear Penguin) have engineered the world’s first brew directly marketed as an aphrodisiac.
An India Pale Ale by definition, the Royal Virility Performance is not only packed with dark chocolate but also Horny Goat Weed extract, the porn star equivalent of Vitamin C.
For now, Brewdog is only producing 1,000 bottles of this erotic elixir, so chances are you’ll need a hefty load of greenbacks to pick one up in the states.

The July sun. A golden beacon of radiance? Or could it be an alien craft from the outer limits, ready to turn your metropolitan area into an ocean of flames, laser burns and pinwheeling mack trucks?
Summer is upon us, and with the mosquitoes and heat exhaustion comes an onslaught of cinematic blockbusters, action-packed and expensive enough to strip the gold from Flava Flav’s molars.
Thor, May 6
To some, Thor is a character from Norse Mythology mentioned briefly in school. To others, he is a comic book hero deservedly brought to the big screen.
To Hollywood, he is a fresh franchise to kick off the summer movies. The follow-up of Iron-Man 2’s post-credit scene of a hammer in New Mexico, Thor centers on the god (Chris Hemsworth) as he is banished to Earth by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins).
Once there, Thor must live up to his divine origins and defend humanity from the wrath of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Expect plenty of hammer throws and thunder bolts in Marvel’s latest film.
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, May 20
When Jack Sparrow indicated he would find the Fountain of Youth in At World’s End, he meant it. Four years after the last Pirates film, Johnny Depp returns as everyone’s favorite pirate in his search for the long-sought road to immortality.
Standing in his way is Blackbeard (Ian McShane), and complicating matters is Sparrow’s love interest, Angelica (Penélope Cruz). Neither Orlando Bloom nor Keira Knightley appear in the film, though Geoffrey Rush returns to reprise his role as Barbossa. Keeping true to the idea of ‘stranger tides,’ the film introduces mermaids and zombies.
Kung Fu Panda 2, May 26
Jack Black returns as Po, after mastering his inner warrior in the first Panda film. The stakes are raised as an emperor peacock (Gary Oldman) threatens to wipe out Kung Fu and take over China with a mysterious new weapon. With the casting of well-known actors including Jackie Chan, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dustin Hoffman, David Cross and Seth Rogen, the stage is set for a satisfying blend of martial arts and witty humor.
Green Lantern, June 17
Holy space drama, Batman! For years, fans demanded a film for this lesser-known hero, and now the Green Lantern has a chance to be DC Comics’ next star.
During a test flight, Air Force pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) discovers a dying alien at a crash site. The alien grants him membership to the Green Lantern Corp. With extensive use of CGI, movie-goers will see not just the Green Lantern world, but the Green Lantern universe.
The trailers are not shy about revealing the Green Lantern Corp. planet with various members, ranging from the goldfish-like Tomar-Re to the bulbous orange Kilowog. To prove his worth to the Green Lantern Corp., which distrusts humans, Hal Jordan must defend Earth from Parallax, a parasitic creature that threatens to disrupt the Green Lantern’s role in the universe.
Captain America: The First Avenger, July 22
If Thor isn’t enough, Marvel is pumping out another major action hero film in hopes of developing a new franchise.
Like Thor, a piece of Captain America’s arsenal, his shield, is glimpsed in Iron-Man 2, sparking the interest for this film. Captain America begins with the lowly Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a soldier physically unqualified to join the U.S. Army during World War II.
Steve Rogers volunteers for a super-soldier program instead and becomes Captain America. The movie takes Captain America from the start of his fight with the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) in the ’40s, into the present, where the battle continues.
Cowboys and Aliens, July 29
Strange movie face-offs don’t always go well, but as the collaboration of director Jon Favreau, producer Steven Spielberg and screenwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, this is bound to be a well-crafted action film. Daniel Craig stars as Jake Lonergan, an amnesiac in 1873 Arizona, who finds himself a wanted criminal by the local strongman (Harrison Ford).
As they settle their quarrels, a strange enemy appears and they join forces to beat the new foe.

Event of the Week: The Psychedelic Furs at The Music Box Saturday. 6 p.m.
Whether you’re a connoisseur of forgotten rock or you simply waited too long to buy tickets to Explosions in the Sky’s sold-out cemetery gig, the good folks at The Music Box have you covered. English legends The Psychedelic Furs will roll through town Saturday night to play a show at the age-old venue.
With the likes of “India” and “Sister Europe,” the Furs were among the most prominent players on both the English and American punk rock scenes from the late ’70s through the ’80s. After a 10-year hiatus, the band reformed in 2000 and has been touring since, reminding both veterans and newcomers where The Jesus and Mary Chain and Nirvana might have found their sound.
Most of the Furs are well beyond middle-aged, so if you want to dance away to “Heaven” one more time, catch them now.
 
News of the Week: The Knife recording new album for 2012
After much radio silence and a quixotic stab at opera with Tomorrow In A Year, brother-and-sister electronica duo The Knife has announced it is hard at work on its fourth studio album.
Shacked up somewhere in their native Sweden, Karin Dreijer Andersson (also known as Fever Ray) and Olof Andersson recently released the news through their official website. Since their 2006 enrapturing Silent Shout, The Knife has all but disappeared from the music scene, leading many to question their continued existence. Thankfully, the haunted-synth duo plans to finish the new album in time for a 2012 release. The Knife also used the announcement to declare its support for the Romani people, who have long suffered discrimination and forced evictions throughout Europe.
 
Movie of the Week: 13 Assassins
Takashi Miike is not a nice guy. After years of subjecting international audiences to showers of blood, brain matter, semen and worse with Audition, Gozu and Ichi the Killer, the Japanese shock cinema denizen is back with one of his most ambitious — and unlikely — works to date: a period epic called 13 Assassins.
Opening in Los Angeles this Friday, Miike’s latest sounds more Kurosawan in nature than one might be inclined to believe.
Set in medieval Japan, the film concerns a band of 13 legendary warriors united by the common goal of killing a murderous dictator. Still, despite its traditional premise, we can expect Miike to subvert the familiar period elements with his own brand of depraved flourishes. (Test screening survivors have reported at least one fetus being eaten.) Call it Seven Samurai for the splat-pack generation.
13 Assassins will be screening at the Nuart Theater upon opening. The film is also available on on demand through Time Warner Cable.
 
Comic Relief of the Week: 
The Governator to return as The Terminator
He said he’d be back. Realizing the collective fantasies of every humor columnist and ex-cabinet member in California, Arnold Schwarzenegger has agreed to reprise his iconic killing machine role in an upcoming Terminator picture.
The Governator broke into mainstream acting in 1984 through his villainous turn in James Cameron’s The Terminator. This was followed by a return in the explosive Terminator 2: Judgment Day and the rather wilted Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Since then, Schwarzenegger has been involved with more diplomatic affairs, one of them governing our fair state. Now, with  Gov. Jerry Brown in office, Schwarzenegger has announced his commitment to the latest entry in the Terminator franchise, currently in the early stages of development.
Even if Schwarzenegger’s return to film turns out to be a disappointing one, it couldn’t be much worse than McG’s recent, Arnold-less Terminator: Salvation. Keep your fingers crossed and watch the streets of Los Angeles for shotgun and motorcycle action in the coming months.

Though the stages at the Festival of Books might grab your attention first, there will be many panels inside USC’s buildings that offer quieter and more intimate, yet equally intriguing, events that appeal to the book lover in you and also cater to other artistic passions.
The panels will cover a variety of topics and will feature appearances by various authors — from some of USC’s very own staff members to other authors you might know.
Below is a guide to some of the engaging panels.
Panel tickets are available for $1 on latimesfob.eventbrite.com.
Some events are already sold out, so make sure to get your tickets to these panels as soon as possible.
 
 
 
Saturday
Seeing is Believing: The Graphic Memoir, Andrus Gerentology Center, 10:30 a.m.
Book lovers need not limit themselves to the written word alone. For all those Comic-Con aficionados, a few panels at the festival offer a look into the world of graphic novels.
Journalist Deborah Vankin, known for her work at the Los Angeles Times and her graphic novels, will moderate the discussion, which will feature other significant figures in the graphic novel world.
Writer Joyce Farmer, author of the graphic memoir Special Exits, which tells the story of her parents’ death, will join the conversation, along with writers Karl Stevens and C. Tyler. The discussion is a good opportunity to get an inside look at this still-living industry and maybe gain some inspiration for your next comic book series.
In Flux: The Music Biz, Taper 201, 4 p.m.
It’s not only art and fiction that come together in the literary world. One of the advantages of the Festival of Books is its wide array of areas for the bookworm to explore.
This discussion will cover aspects of writing and the music industry, and the state of the Los Angeles Times. Pop music editor Randall Roberts will moderate the conversation between a slew of others involved in both the writing and the music industries.
The discussion will cover a variety of music genres, as it includes writers like Dan Charnas, author of Big Payback: The History of the Business of Hip Hop, who worked for recording companies like Def American Recordings.
Page & Screen, Norris, 3:30 p.m.
The film world wouldn’t want to be left out, either. This panel features a star-studded group that includes 24 executive producer Howard Gordon, who extended his writing talent into the fictional world with his work Gideon’s War, released earlier this year. Joining him will be Pamela Ribon, who was an executive story editor on Samantha Who? and produced Mind of Mencia.
A self-proclaimed “weird girl,” she has also published books like Why Girls Are Weird and encourages readers on her blog to attend the discussion so they can see her embarrass herself, if nothing else.
Mix in E. Duke Vincent, who has worked with shows like 7th Heaven and Beverly Hills, 90210, and moderator and author Heather Havrilesky, and this discussion will likely prove an interesting blend of experiences and personalities.
 
Sunday
Father Gregory Boyle and Steve Lopez in Conversation, Bovard, 11 a.m.
Not all of the festival deals with fiction. Father Gregory Boyle, founder of Homeboy Industries, a company dedicated to taking jail members off the streets by giving them jobs, will sit down for a conversation with Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez.
Lopez wrote The Soloist: A Lost Dream, An Unlike Friendship, And The Redemptive Power of Music, which was adapted into a 2009 movie featuring Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. This non-fiction work tells the story of Lopez’s experiences with a struggling, homeless violinist.
Boyle and Lopez, therefore, will prove an intriguing pair and will likely have a both intellectually and emotionally stimulating conversation about their separate, but similar, experiences.

We’re in the midst of food crisis in America.
No, not our lack of legislation to protect small, independent farmers, not the growth of fast food and obesity and not the factory farms and slaughterhouses in this country that look more like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre than somewhere we get food. These are all problems, yes, but not really our personal crises.
The real problem is that, for lack of a better metaphor, we want to have our cake and eat it, too. But as this figure of speech dictates, that’s not always possible.
A lot of people say they want to eat better. By better we’re talking about a lot of things: healthy, local, organic or trendy.
This desire explains quite a few things that have happened or are happening in the food world.
After all, premium coffee consumption has skyrocketed in the past decade, and organic foods — once special and somewhat rare — can now be found stacked alongside regular products in pretty much any market anywhere in the United States.
Even fast food companies, once bastions of cheap, greasy, unapologetic fodder, now chase “quality” as a catchphrase, offering $7 “premium” burgers without any hint of irony.
And the crisis behind all this is that we’re stuck in a big fat contradiction, where we want more quality but don’t want to give up instant gratification and convenience.
Take the whole ordeal with organic foods, for instance. The average person might choose to buy a bunch of organically grown carrots from the supermarket, or maybe a can of organic soup.
But they also might not care at all about what sort of meat they’re buying, simply because it’s not as convenient to seek out local, organic or pasture-raised meat, and also because it’s more expensive, never mind the average price difference is only about 15 percent.
I know this problem well. I’m as guilty of it as anyone else, especially being in college without a car and with awkward dinner schedules to deal with.
I also know a lot of people who would disagree about there being a problem. Bottom line, more expensive is not good, some might say. Eat to live, not live to eat.
Although that might ring true for some, for many, eating is an awesome part of life. It’s delicious, obviously. Cathartic. Gratifying. Exciting.
For something as integral and necessary as food, isn’t it about time we actually started putting in some effort to at least make a few good decisions?
Like choosing local eateries that source their own ingredients instead of national chains that fly frozen food everywhere. That’s one easy step that only requires a minute of thought and maybe a Google search.
Or just taking an hour out of the day to make a good, fresh meal. That’s a decision that’s beneficial because you’re choosing to focus on and control what’s being consumed. Or spend the extra dollar or two on cage-free eggs. Not so bad, right?
After years of dirt-cheap produce, seafood and meat, it’s normal for that little bit of extra effort and money and time to feel almost unpleasant.
You might wish that instead of cooking and having to clean your pans you had just gone to Panda Express.
But give it some time. Watch that piece of air-dried, pasture-raised chicken breast as it sizzles in the oven and acknowledge you’re not eating an animal that was stuck sitting in its own crap for hours on end.
Heat up a pan and sauteé some organic rainbow swiss chard, with radiant technicolor stalks, and take solace in the fact that there’s a local farmer who is finally being rewarded for mitigating environmental impact for not using synthetic pesticides.
With time, that foreign feeling of having spent too much money or having gone out of your way for something as ordinary as a plate of food will fade, replaced instead by the sensation you’ve chosen to really care about everything eating affects, not just yourself.
Does it all sound a bit too romantic? Sure. But frankly, that doesn’t change the result.
Eating can be a luxury, a small thing to look forward to day after day, when things get hard or stressful. Yes, it nourishes the body. But as much of a cliché as it is, it can also nourish the mind and soul.
We’re stuck in a crisis of what and how to eat, but at the end of the day, wouldn’t you rather do the best you can?

Since 1996, the Los Angeles Times has celebrated the written word with the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books.
Every April for 15 years, the festival was held at UCLA featuring a variety of author signings, publisher booths and book vendors.
Attracting upward of 140,000 people in the past, according to the Los Angeles Times, it is by far the largest book festival in the country.
Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
And this weekend, with free entry and hundreds of authors and exhibitors, the Festival of Books is set to transform USC.
A performance by the Trojan Marching Band and words from Times publisher Eddy Hartenstein and President C. L. Max Nikias kick off the Festival this Saturday at 10 a.m.
Attendees are then free to get books signed by their favorite authors or to inquire about an author’s work at booths set up around campus.
In previous years, the Festival  has featured authors and celebrities like Ray Bradbury, Gore Vidal, Michael J. Fox, Henry Winkler and Buzz Aldrin, to name a few.
This year the festival will include the likes of T.C. Boyle,  a member of the USC faculty, Dana Goodyear, Mary Higgins Clark, Kenneth Turan and Ted Danson.
On Sunday, the School of Cinematic Arts will host panels on the comic book industry, including one called  “Editing Comics the BOOM! Studios Way.” Los Angeles Times “Hero Complex” writer Geoff Boucher will be on hand to lead interviews.
The Festival includes a “Discover the World” section, showcasing the cultures of countries like Israel and South Korea.
Local museums, such as the Natural History Museum, are featured in the Arts and Culture Neighborhood Zone.
A number of outdoor stages will host performances, musical and otherwise. On Sunday at 11:40 a.m., USC’s Drama Club presents “Prequels to Classic Plays,” followed by an a cappella performance by SoCal VoCals at 12:50 p.m on the USC stage.
Of course, reading cannot be overlooked at the festival. A banner on the Los Angeles Times Pavilion wall asks visitors “What Are Your Reading?”
For two years, visitors have answered this question by writing on the 40-by-12 foot white wall. In the past, the most popular reads have been the Bible, the Koran and a number of classics, like The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye.
For writers, the Festival brings a wealth of resources. It offers bookstore exhibitors like Vroman’s Bookstore and Skylight Books, as well as publishing groups like Baker Publishing Group and SLG Publishing.
Writers can also sign up for seminars for $100 each. The seminars cover the different parts of the writing process, such as “Working with Editors and Publishers” and “Making a Life for Writing.”
Don’t miss out on this significant event and the opportunity to explore the bookworm in you.

It’s that wonderful time of year again. You’re weeks away from summer — you can almost taste it. Whether you got the dream internship, you are lucky enough to be travelling abroad or plan to park yourself on a beach somewhere until classes resume again in August, summer is mercifully and tantalizingly beckoning you.

Just like the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. With deadlines rapidly approaching for both federal student aid documents and USC supplemental forms, Trojans are completing financial aid documents before they ride off into the summer breeze. In fact, virtually all college students are — total outstanding student debt in the United States is fast approaching $1 trillion, surpassing aggregate credit card debt levels last year, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Yes, Americans now owe more on their college loans than they do on their credit cards.
Some economists have argued that this is a good sign. Maybe, they say, this means people are actually starting to gain control of their credit card debt.
But the real reason behind the skyrocketing rate of student debt is quite simple — and much more frightening. The price of a college education has risen roughly 450 percent since 1982, while household income has risen only 150 percent. It’s supply and demand; more Americans have been attending college in those years, boosted by scholarships and grant programs while college supply hasn’t kept up.
Rising costs at most major universities — coupled with a down economy — have forced students to seek out more private loans, as well. These loans are adjustable rate loans, which are notorious for their unpredictability.
Add the fact that unemployment for college graduates is the highest it’s been since 1970, according to USA Today, and students with those loans are facing slim prospects of repaying their debt in full and on time. For-profit entities focusing exclusively on loan origination, adjustable rate private loans and sputtering financial indicators — does this sound familiar?
It should. These are virtually the same warning signs that preceded the burst of the housing bubble, which in turn unleashed the financial crisis in late 2008.
If anything, the student loan bubble is scarier and potentially more fearsome. The cost of a college education has, since 1978, risen 600 basis points over inflation, according to n+1 Magazine. U.S. housing rose at only 50 basis points over the consumer price index during those same years. In other words, as high as housing prices climbed, and destructively fell, college tuition costs have climbed 12 times higher  during the same period of time.
Student loan default rates have, expectedly, started to rise. These loans would be the equivalent of subprime mortgages, especially because they are sold to major financial institutions. In short, the parallels between the housing bubble and the current vital signs for the student loan market look startlingly similar.
There are indicators to the contrary, however. The Economist has conducted research on the matter and concluded that, though unemployment among those with degrees is very high, a payoff still exists for those who obtain a bachelor’s degree as compared to those with just a high school education.  That payoff, the report concluded, was significant — averaging roughly $20,000 to $30,000 in increased salary per degree beyond a high school diploma.
Though economic cycles might diminish the short-term “rate of return” of a degree, the ultimate benefits of a college degree vastly outweigh the costs in the long-term.
Furthermore, though private loans have adjustable rates, private companies have taken greater pains to underwrite their risk than they did with mortgages in the 2000s.
The sooner hiring picks up, and graduates are able to repay loans, the faster concerns over a looming student debt bubble will dissipate. If hiring continues to stagnate, however, a frighteningly large bubble might be waiting to burst.

I love the old kanard …..   the average college graduate makes more in the long run than a high school graduate. That line of thinking enables the whole education industry, student loan industry and students to borrow borrow and borrow.  I am in a graduate program and I noticed not one proffessor will touch on the issue of student loans. Even the proffesors are in on the biggest scame,  as student loans are what fund thier salaries. They would never make an academic subject out of student loans and the rising cost of tuition. When I brought it up in class one day the topic was quickly changed. I wish this bubble would burst!
Your comments contain so many misspelled words and grammatical errors that I assumed you were just being facetious.  And you are a grad student?!?  You’re right.  Stop wasting your money on school and get a job.
People who take the time to scrutinize over one’s grammar within internet comments are the ones in need of a job. Don’t you have something better to do with your time?
Yes!  I want to see more of this out and about.  The next big bubble!  We churn out more than 1.5 million “educated” people every year, we’ve lost some 7 million jobs near permanently since 2007, and the Gen Xers and Baby Boomers are not getting off or making room on the ladder whatsoever (they simply can’t afford to).  Our youth unemployment is somewhere around 16% official, I think that’s only 25 year olds and below.  Underemployment is higher, and important: can’t repay that $24,000 average on minimum wage and survive.  Not without some parental assistance/drug dealing.  
Compare official and unofficial youth un- and underemployment to default rates in the coming months, long term un- and underemployment being the most important.  Somewhere I’ve read that if 1% of all bank customers withdrew their funds nationwide, there would be a massive collapse.  Banks are still stretched thin.  Little matter, as the government does indeed finance a great deal of these loans.  Will it print-bail itself out (again) should this bubble burst?  Can I start using dollars for wallpaper yet?    
And, when the heck will the riots start?  It only seems to take near 20% for parts of Europe to go.  Too much damn X-box, that’s what.  I want to see our lovely free-speech zones in use.  The zones ensure your precious voice gets heard by those that are in power!  Nevermind, obey and pay!  Don’t worry that you can’t have a house, ever, and you will only be able to safely finance one child when you’re well into your late 30s.  Raising kids sucks, right?  Good thing?
Lenders don’t make these loans anymore – the government does.  The government can make more money from these loans as they have a lower cost of funds.  
The point of the article was that high college costs are driving increases in borrowing.
Yes, loans are tough and require repayment, but they also help people get ahead.  Yes, we can create a better program for students , let’s focus on that.  Most of the defaults happen at lower quality schools where students did not get the education they needed – let’s look at that issue.
It is easy to complain – let’s focus on solutions!  Loans are not going away, let work on lower the cost of education and improving the quality.  Job growth is obviously important as well – but it always is.
The default rate on student loans has been higher than that of subprime home mortgages for years, but the public was never told, and still doesn’t know.More disturbing:  both lenders and guarantors of these loans have a clear financial incentive for the loans to default, and this is by design.   The bombshell story that was recently quashed by lending system “experts”:  Even the Department of Education is making, not losing money on defaulted student loans, and has been for years. This last claim is controversial, but not if one only looks at the numbers.
This is what is interesting and different about student loans.  These are the facts that get to the root of the student loan crisis, and all of its warts (inflation, corruption, oversight, etc.), and underneath is all lie the removal of consumer protections, and collection powers that are unrivaled by any other debt instrument in this country.  Not to mention a stunning opportunity for Congress and the president to demonstrate the ability to provide “better, not more government” in a non-partisan fashion.

In an effort to lessen our dependence on a finite resource, President Barack Obama this week called for a repeal of billions of dollars in government subsidies to oil companies. The repealed subsidies amount to $4 billion annually. The president said the money can be invested directly into what he believes is the future of job growth in the United States — alternative energy.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Debate about repealing tax breaks for oil companies is nothing new, though it gained ground over the last few days when House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) demonstrated a willingness to consider repealing some of the big tax breaks enjoyed by companies that, frankly, don’t need them.
Gradually taking money from the oil companies and putting it into clean energy will generate some impact (economically and environmentally) down the road.
Still these discussions between both parties are mere baby steps — if that.
As every day goes by, our economy becomes more dependent on a natural resource that is increasingly becoming a source of insecurity and instability in the United States.
An end to our dependence on foreign oil must come from the bottom up; the consumers who drive the market must push for change.
U.S. defense spending is greater than the next nine countries’ combined. Much of that expenditure is spent securing sea-lanes for oil ships.   Other developing countries that depend on oil and gas for growth should seek to challenge the United States’ naval dominance.
For example, as China seeks natural resources to foster growth, it could come into military conflict with the United States if shipping lanes become areas of contention.
More importantly, though, the world’s dependence on oil empowers foreign leaders who often rule tyrannically and ruthlessly over undemocratic countries.
The transnational sale of oil empowers and enriches a select few within the exporting country.
More often than not, this creates extremely uneven growth and, as is the select group seeks to hold onto power, its members choose not to develop institutions of a free-market economy because they don’t need them to hold onto their power and prosperity. Instead, they use force.
For this reason, governments in Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria, where oil exports account of a significant part of the countries’ gross domestic product, are currently facing strong social opposition.
And since domestic politics and social change now have global repercussions, the United States spends even more money policing and aiding rebellions and revolutions in countries in the Middle East.
American taxpayer dollars help ensure undemocratic and ruthless foreign dictators stay in power, but they also finance their removal and, in the case of Iraq, the nation’s high price reconstruction.
In the short term, the Obama administration should reduce oil imports by increasing domestic oil development and production. It should also develop alternatives to oil to standardize and enforce the production of more efficient cars and trucks.
Undoubtedly, these measures have risks and downsides. Offshore drilling can be extremely detrimental and costly — especially when accidents happen — and expanding biofuels and natural gas markets will have a negative effect on the environment.
On the other hand, putting more fuel-efficient cars and trucks on the road helps, and the Obama administration has already institutionalized a greener auto-market by encouraging the purchase of hybrid cars.
But these changes will neither sufficiently fix the problem nor ensure Americans aren’t funding the disturbing and costly oil-cycle.
To substantially reduce oil consumption, the Obama administration could raise the price of gasoline through either taxing at the pump or removing U.S. subsidies to oil and gas companies.
If the price of gas goes up, Americans should respond by using cars less, and eventually will begin demanding for more fuel-efficient means of transportation.
As a result, carmakers will have an economic incentive to produce fuel-efficient or electric cars and, at the same time, higher gasoline prices would eventually encourage substitution.
Innovation, which relies on funding, is required to substitute our dependence on oil and gas with alternative energy solutions. Money accrued by the government by taxing or removing gas subsidies could be invested in alternative energy and non-oil fuel development and production as well or help reduce the deficit.
But when it comes down to it, the more confident investors become that alternative energy and non-oil fuels, the more they will invest in such projects.
The Obama administration has a reason and a way to decrease our dependence on foreign oil.
Ultimately, American consumers, as the individuals who by a large margin consume the most oil of any public in the world, will dictate the success of this endeavor — not our politicians.
It is time for the Obama administration and the American public to end the discussion and finally stimulate the development and production of alternative energy sources.
 
William Fay is a senior majoring in international relations. His column, “Facing Our Global Challenges,” ran every other Thursday.
It’s not only the US is too dependent on foreign oil, it is countries all over the world that is dependent on oil. Governments usually take time to act and sometimes it is to late when the crisis occurs.

I’m not inclined to listen to enviromentalists and Democrats who have created this problem. We should have drilled a long time ago.

When I was younger, USC was associated solely with its Division I football team.
I knew nothing of the school’s academics, research, student life or any other of the number of things that make this university what it was.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Up until around the turn of the century, most of the country had a similarly narrow-minded view of USC.
Many viewed USC as a school for over-privileged, underachieving students with a penchant for focusing on their social lives.
If you happen to stay on campus this weekend, you might notice that image has all but perished.
The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books taking place this weekend indicates the intellectual culture at USC has changed for the better. This is evident not only in our rise in both national and international rankings but also by observing the campus and its surroundings.
Just this year — the first of President C. L. Max Nikias’ tenure — we have seen USC establish an even stronger foothold among the nation’s top universities.
The recent flood of large donations and its ability to attract top scholars has allowed our university to gain tremendous respect throughout the nation.
Nikias announced yesterday a $110 million donation from USC alumnus John Mork and his wife Julie to establish an endowment for undergraduate scholarships. Earlier this semester, USC received a $200 million gift, the largest single donation in university history, from alumnus David Dornsife and his wife Dana to the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences.
Donations such as these play a significant role in USC’s continuing rise to the status of elite university — especially the Morks’ donation to establish a scholarship fund.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the scholarships will be merit-based and will cover the cost of tuition in addition to $5,000 in annual spending money.
At first, about 40 students each year will receive the scholarship, but that is expected to soon rise to about 100 students annually.
By establishing such scholarships, the university ensures it will continue its progress away from the old stereotype of a school full of over-privileged students.
The scholarships will allow students who might otherwise not be able to afford the cost of tuition to attend USC, bolstering the school’s economic diversity in addition to its academic excellence.
But through all this, many people still like to label USC as a rich kids’ school, giving it nicknames like “the University of Spoiled Children.”
According to the US News & World Report, however, USC is the third most economically diverse top-ranked school in the nation.
And in addition to the growing academic excellence and diversity of USC’s student body, the university is rising in prominence by becoming an even more active member of its community.
It’s precisely for these reasons that USC will, for the first and certainly not the last time, host the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, one of the nation’s largest book festivals.
Thousands of people and several prominent authors and speakers will descend upon our campus this weekend to celebrate the written word, but for those of us who are proud members of the Trojan Family, it might well feel like a celebration of our university instead.
The fact that prominent events such as the Festival of Books are choosing to partner with USC reflects how prestigious this university is rapidly becoming.
In addition to the prominence the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books offers USC, it also presents another opportunity for the university to solidify its status as an active member of its community.
Throughout the year, the university has hosted events like this — such as President Barack Obama’s visit in the fall or the Dalai Lama’s upcoming presentations in May — that allow for members of the surrounding community to come and enjoy what a school like USC has to offer.
As USC continues to strive toward even greater excellence under Nikias, we will likely witness a shift in the identity of the university.
In much the same way, current and future generations of Trojans can have the opportunity to shape it themselves.

USC has THREE Nobel Lauretes on staff–facts are important–huh?
I don’t think so. I think a university’s prestige manifests itself when notable professors/researchers join the faculty; when these faculty contribute to meaningful advances in science, technology and medicine; and when USC attracts more than 1 Nobel laureate…the things UCLA already has, hence them flipping that card on us everytime we whoop them in football. It’s all good right? a vast majority of UCLA undergrads pursue cake majors while thinking their med-school is a direct reflection of them. I’m always like, “yeah, OK there Mr. poli-sci, keep on doing them easy majors…”
btw, bmb, old school Trojans aren’t a direct reflection of contemporaneous Trojans, not even close. The days when your sub-1000 SAT scores and sub-3.0 high school GPA BOUGHT you a spot into SC doesn’t reflect me nor the rest of today’s Trojans. Speak for yourself.
I don’t think we need to belittle USC’s past every time we want to praise the current USC. As a recent Ph.D. graduate, I found more and more that our school’s academic history is not one to be shamed of. Although not one of the true elite universities, we produced enough share of scholars, scientist, engineers, politicians, entrepreneurs, artists, … Our older alumni are not underachievers, instead they overachieved of their less-stellar high-school academic records. I truly think our school is unique in that it advances one’s career beyond his/her potential perceived by other people. This is one true goal of EDUCATION.
It may be true that many laymen recognized USC only for its football. But that is not USC’s fault. There are always less-informed, less-educated people outside, let alone people from some schools enjoying badmouthing our Alma mater every chance they get. It may also be true our older alumni were not star students in the high-school class, but our school has been among top 50 since the ranking exists, and our alumni most have their career, and some are very successful.
Indeed, today’s USC has a much higher status. But it does grow out of our past — the spirit of fight on, the love of USC, the loyalty of our alumni. Let’s be elated at our present, and also be proud of our past.
Did the festival move to USC because they wanted to, or because UCLA couldn’t host it this year for some reason? Why is it REALLY here?

College.
For some of us, like yours truly, it’s coming to an abrupt, expensive end. As us seniors look back on our USC undergraduate experience, we remember our friends, lovers, classes – and of course, our movies.
Here’s one last roundup of must-see movies that encapsulate the college experience – either by being about college or just capturing the zeitgeist or just by having a release date from 2007-2011. Enjoy – and feel free to catch up on these films to procrastinate from studying for finals.
The Hangover (2009)
You know every single line. This will be a movie you show your children once they’re old enough. And you will tell them the story about the first time you saw this movie — in college.
The Graduate (1967)
A beautiful, classic film set, strangely, to an entire Simon and Garfunkel album.
Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)
Jason Segel’s bare butt appears within the first ten minutes of the movie. And who can deny that?
 
Animal House (1978) 
John Belushi’s finest work was in this iconic frat film based on Dartmouth’s Greek life.
300 (2006)
The epic to end all epics, 300, got you and your friends to take every opportunity to scream “NO – THIS. IS. SPARTA!” after anyone declared “This is madness.”
Rudy (1993)
The ultimate sports tearjerker. End of story.
Up (2009)
Combining the Pixar look and nostalgia that our generation grew up with and a touching story that spoke to the lonely person inside all of us, Up is a nearly perfect movie.
Role Models (2008)
Come on, you know you love Kiss!
The Dark Knight (2008)
Who didn’t, at one point, have some sort of Joker-themed swag? Heath Ledger’s memorable performance is what separates this Bat flick from the litter.
(500) Days of Summer (2009)
Everyone has had their heart broken. And in this movie, it’s all set in front of our own downtown Los Angeles.
Up In the Air (2009)
George Clooney’s character is the man we at once aspire to become and hope to never be like. And it was a lesson in what not to choose in our upcoming adult lives.
 
The Social Network (2010)
Yep. I had to include this one.
Drumline (2002)
Though they’re not as awesome as the Trojan Marching Band, the musical hijinks entertain.
St. Elmo’s Fire (1985)
Following a group’s fruition from college to adult life, St. Elmo’s Fire explored growing up in the ‘80s – all to a super sick, albeit dated, soundtrack.
National Lampoon’s Van Wilder (2002)
If you haven’t seen this movie, you should be ashamed of yourself. But you probably still eat éclairs with a straight face.
Legally Blonde (2001)
Not only was USC part of the set of this classic, Reese Witherspoon delivers a spunky, adorable performance that she has not been able to replicate in her later career.
Old School (2003)
Shoutout to Trojan Will Ferrell! Old School is every middle aged man’s fantasy – and is a delight to watch.
Good Will Hunting (1997)
Two words: Matt Damon.
Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle (2004)
The ultimate buddy comedy convinced us all that cravings can create adventures. And rides on the back of tigers. Oh, and Neil Patrick Harris ain’t so bad either.
Back to School (1986)
Rodney Dangerfields hits the books – and gets the laughs in this classic.
Half of these movies don’t have anything to do with college at all.
You also didn’t include Revenge of the Nerds, which is second only to Animal House as the ultimate classic college comedy. Blasphemy.
There’s also a bunch of great college films like Rules of Attraction, PCU, and Real Genius that you left out.
