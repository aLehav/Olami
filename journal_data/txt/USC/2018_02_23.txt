Last Wednesday, tragedy — and devastatingly redundant tragedy, at that — struck Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Seventeen people, many of whom were students as young as 14 years old, were shot dead, and 14 were sent to the hospital after a gunman walked on campus with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.

One of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, Parkland follows a string of similar gun-related tragedies that rocked our nation and sparked contentious dialogue about how to move forward. Similar to Parkland, there was the Sandy Hook shooting that killed 27, mostly young students at a Connecticut elementary school in 2012. In 2016, there was the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando that killed 49. At the end of last year, a mass shooting in Las Vegas killed 59, and was followed within weeks by a shooting at a Texas church that killed 26.
Each incident was uniquely devastating, and in each case, too soon were we forced to collectively move on to mourn the next. But Parkland feels different — Parkland is different. Not because it is somehow more tragic than its predecessors, but because of the student-led, survivor-led movement it has sparked, and the passion and promise of this movement, which could yield the changes requisite to finally put an end to this epidemic.
As the Daily Trojan’s Editorial Board wrote last fall in the wake of the aforementioned Las Vegas shooting, gun violence has in many ways become a millennial issue. Of course, with the exception of the disproportionate effects of gun violence on female domestic abuse victims and people of color afflicted by police brutality, mass shootings can be indiscriminate in whom they target. But as students today, in our lifetimes we have witnessed and experienced increased mass shootings and widened accessibility to weapons that can kill hundreds in minutes. And we have gone through these tragedies, all while often watching and feeling helpless as none sparked necessary change, and each episode devastatingly seemed to pave the way for the next.
But the student survivors of the Parkland shooting have wholly flipped the script on this, in a way that affects all Americans and, in particular, American students. Young people may be known for low voter turnout rates and stereotyped as apathetic; it would be easy to assume repeated, senseless violence and repeated inaction from those with all the decision-making power would sow only further disillusionment. 
But in the past week, Stoneman Douglas High School students David Hogg, Cameron Kasky and Emma Gonzalez, among others, each weathering heartless internet bullying and right-wing conspiracy theories without flinching, have become household names. They have led large-scale social media campaigns and are coordinating national marches for gun control that are predicted to attract hundreds of thousands. They have challenged our nation’s most prominent lawmakers — such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican receiving millions in funding from the National Rifle Association — on national television. They have not only won the backing of and drew celebrity donors to speak up for gun control, but also engaged thousands — maybe millions — of students and young people across the country.
Since the Parkland shooting, lawmakers across the country — many of whom receive donations in the thousands and millions from the NRA — have simply refused to talk about not only gun control but also guns in general. On Tuesday, Florida legislators voted down a bill that would have banned semi-automatic guns — the weapon that killed 17 in Parkland. President Donald Trump has yet to even publicly address guns, except to float the objectively dangerous idea of arming teachers. 
We hear the same, often widely discredited or disproven talking points every time: that gun control laws are impossible to enforce; that arming more, “good” civilians is a more effective solution; that mass shootings are not a gun but a mental health issue. Through all the years mass shootings have been happening and all the years the NRA has dominated politics, we have always been expected to passively accept these answers and wait idly for the next tragedy to ensue. At this very University last semester, a false alarm that a gunman was on campus yielded only a brief pause in campus life before students and faculty were expected to resume as if nothing abnormal had happened.
We have been conditioned to accept gun violence as a tragic but inevitable commodity, and if anyone was expected to passively fall in line with this narrative, it was young people, students, teenagers. But instead, it’s young people showing up for rallies, sharing information on social, registering and turning out to vote, and calling representatives as part of a tightly coordinated national effort. Student activists across the country are the ones paving the way forward, and they are the ones — not actionless legislators — whose examples we must follow.

On Tuesday, Annenberg Media reported a change in the commencement dress code, effective for the class of 2018’s ceremony on May 18. In the article, an official from the Office of Cultural Relations and University Events said that graduating students are now required to wear officially branded gowns, and cannot borrow plain gowns or have them recreated by a third party as students have done in the past. 
The required gowns for this year have an updated design and must be purchased from Herff Jones, an academic regalia vendor, through their website or the USC Bookstore. The cheapest package for renting the required cap and gown is $70. If a student wants to own it, the price jumps up to $169 for a “Basic Grad Pack” with the regalia plus graduation announcements, or $263 for a custom embroidered gown. USC also said that they are not sure what will be done if a student arrives in a gown that does not fit the dress code. 
Without a doubt, commencement is a special day that should be treated with respect and dignity, but the requirement of another chunk of cash from students who have already given hundreds of thousands of dollars and years of their lives to this institution feels like yet another example of the University putting its own branding before the needs  of actual students. 
There is no available information on how prevalent the use of third party or borrowed gowns in previous years has been at USC, but on an intuitive level, it seems like it couldn’t have been that much of a problem. For the last 134 spring commencement ceremonies, those who could afford an official cap and gown bought one, and those who couldn’t afford it — maybe because they use their money for tuition — still walked across the stage, still got their diploma, still went into the working world as proud Trojans. The ceremony didn’t fall through because they had a plain or cheap-looking graduation gown, and photos of the graduating classes of 1881-2017 still radiated joy, regardless of some misplaced piping or not-quite-cardinal-red sleeves.
The most telling part of the Annenberg Media article was the fact that USC officials chose to require these gowns after the vendor approached them, stating that USC is the only school “at their level” that doesn’t require customized regalia. Ever since the Steven Sample’s presidency and USC’s ascension in academic circles, the University has had a compulsion to keep up with the Ivy League Joneses. Herff Jones seems to have picked up that there’s no better way to get USC to do something than to tell them that Stanford or Harvard is doing it better. 
This sense of competition can be helpful when it inspires us to push into new areas of research, hire the best professors or improve student resources. But when it comes to the level of aesthetic choices that not only require student money but also might leave some students out of a commencement, it seems that the University has forgotten what commencement is really about. 
Commencement is an important ceremony, and the robes and caps that graduates wear reflect a long history of academic excellence. But at the end of the day, it is about the students and their achievements, not the uniforms they wear or the perfect photos they take. 
Putting aesthetics before accessibility is a clear blunder for a school that is actively trying to shed its reputation as the “University of Spoiled Children.” In the article, officials explained that the cash burden is put on students because USC doesn’t include the costs of caps and gowns in annual student fees like other schools do, but if uniform gowns are so important to the school, why don’t they reallocate student fees to include the gowns? 
Most students can probably handle losing a few residential education events to get their cap and gown paid for at commencement. Further, an extra $70 just to walk across a stage is just another example of the incidental, hidden costs of college, analogous to $300 textbooks or $900 laptops, that are not included in the (already exorbitant) sticker price of the school, and can make low-income students feel unwelcome or deter them from attending USC. 
Along with four years of hard work, the average undergraduate has already given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the University; graduate and doctoral students have dedicated even more than that. To then require a $70 rental of a gown that will only be worn for a few hours and used for a few photo ops is an eyeroll-worthy representation of our school’s obsession with its own branding, and it is evident that the University needs to reexamine its priorities.

After two crushing losses this past weekend against No. 9 Oregon and No. 15 Oregon State, the women’s basketball team looked for a turnaround win against the Utah Utes on Thursday night. They went on to win 53-52 in overtime.

Utah entered the game without their two top scorers Megan Huff and Daneesha Provo but still kept the game competitive against USC. 
In the 3rd quarter, USC took a 6-point lead but Utah roared back to take a 35-34 lead entering the final period.
In the 4th, the teams fought neck and neck as the teams were tied at 45 before sophomore forward Ja’Tavia Tapley fouled Utah forward Megan Jacobs with 11 seconds left in the game. However, Jacobs missed both free throws and the game headed into overtime.
Utah began overtime with 4 straight points, but USC would fight back to trail 50-52 with 15 seconds remaining. USC got a crucial stop by forcing a shot clock violation with three seconds on the game clock and on the other end, senior forward Kristen Simon stepped out to hit the go-ahead 3-pointer in front of Utes’ star Emily Potter to give USC a 53-52 lead with a second left. Utah attempted a lob which was broken up by senior guard Jordan Adams, giving the Trojans a nail-biting win.
“I practice that shot every day for practice,” Simon said. “I shoot almost a hundred of them.”
The Trojans were led by a huge game by Simon who posted 16 points, 15 rebounds, three steals and the game-winning shot. Senior guard Sadie Edwards added 13 points and junior guard Aliyah Mazyck, who fouled out in the 4th quarter, had 10. Despite a poor shooting night for the Trojans (4 of 22 from the 3-point line), their defense shined. Utah also shot poorly at 36.2 percent and during their last two possessions, USC forced a shot clock violation and broke up a clever play to win the game. Potter paced Utah with 20 points, 15 rebounds and two blocks. Utah’s free-throw shooting (9 of 17 from the charity stripe) ultimately doomed them as they were unable to convert crucial freebies in the 4th quarter and overtime which kept USC in the game.
“Hats off to Utah, they did a heckuva job on gameplan, [head coach] Lynne Roberts was excellent,” USC head coach Mark Trakh said. “They played great and we were fortunate enough to make that last shot.”
USC will close the regular season by hosting Colorado. In their previous matchup, USC embarrassed Colorado 86-51 in front of their home crowd.The Buffaloes are spearheaded by lead guard Kennedy Leonard who averages 14.9 points to go with 6.6 assists and 1.9 steals. The team also features a deep supporting cast that can help shoulder the load from time to time. However, the Buffaloes have generally struggled against other Pac-12 teams.
“Everybody’s tough in the Pac-12,” Trakh said. “Colorado [and Utah] are both very well coached, they play hard so it’s going to be a situation where we just have to get after it.”
As the Trojans close the season, it also means that the team will be bidding farewell to three of its key players: Simon, Adams and Edwards. Simon has done an excellent job as USC’s primary post player and offensive focal point, leading the team in scoring at 17.7 points and 8.7 rebounds per game. Edwards has helped support the team on both ends: scoring the ball (13.8 points on average) and serving as a solid defender. Adams might not be the flashiest player but her energy, leadership and all-around game have proven to be vital to this USC squad. Saturday’s game against the Buffaloes will be the three players’ last game in the Galen Center.
“[The seniors] have done a great job,” Trakh said. “I love all of them, they’ve all done a great job, they’ve all bought into everything and hopefully, they’ve had a good experience while they were here in USC.”
USC is still holding out hope for a berth in the NCAA Tournament, which begins in March.

Coming off a dominant run in 2017 which saw them finish as national champions for the third -straight year, the No. 1 beach volleyball team will look to come out of the gates strong for the 2018 season.

The team will strive to carry on the momentum that helped them secure a national championship, this weekend at the Arizona State Tournament, where they will face Pac-12 foe Arizona State, in-state rival Cal Poly and Big-12 opponent Nebraska.
Cal Poly will be the most formidable threat to the Trojans over the weekend, as they placed as high as No. 14 in last year’s AVCA poll. The Arizona State Sun Devils will also prove to be a dangerous threat to the Trojans as they rode a six-game winning streak into the Pac-12 tournament last season before falling to the Trojans.
Although the defending champion Trojans will be favorites in all of their matches over the weekend, they understand the challenges that a new season brings and the importance of continuing to get better.
According to head coach Anna Collier, the team has made it a point of emphasis to understand that the past is exactly that.
“We talk a lot about not having done anything yet,” Collier said. “This team has done nothing. Even though we have a lot of the same people, we really recognize that we haven’t even won a match yet. Let’s concentrate on us starting our legacy, our history and our winning streak, and I think that helps settle everyone down.”
Although the Trojans are looking to replace five starters from last year’s national championship team, they understand a “next man up” mentality is necessary to be successful heading into the season opener. Among the players leading the charge will be returning seniors Jenna Belton, Terese Cannon and Jo Kremer. Kremer, a former Pac-12 all-academic team honoree, was adamant in her willingness to take on a bigger role in her final season.
“Personally, I want to improve on my leadership abilities as a senior. I really want to be a leader that can take us all the way to NCAA’s at the end of the year,” Kremer said.
As a senior leader, Kremer also anticipated that while there are certain adjustments to be made, the team will be able to kick into another gear once the season starts. 
“As a team because we are so new and young, I think we are gonna improve on our partner relationships and our whole team dynamic once we get into season,” Kremer said. “We’re gonna get really close, and have a good time winning together, and supporting each other.”
As far as lineups for the weekend’s tournament, Collier will look to a healthy mixture of experience and youth in the lineup to jumpstart the Trojans. 
“We’ll have a freshman and an upperclassmen for the first 3 pairs and some strong seniors at the 4 and 5,” she said. “We want to have a good, solid team at each flight.” 
The Trojans will look to sweep the weekend tournament and return home to Los Angeles with three key wins to start the season as a showdown with perennial beach volleyball powerhouses Pepperdine and UCLA loom the week after.

The Trojans have quickly bounced back after their opening day loss to Utah Valley, winning three games in a row heading into their weekend series against the undefeated Villanova Wildcats.

“A couple big swings were the difference,” head coach Dan Hubbs said after the opening day loss, according to USC Athletics. “We got runners on in each of the first three innings. In the third we had a runner on and Lars smokes a ball to right that is caught and then Matthew Acosta just missed a home run. That could have changed the complexion of the game. We just didn’t get anything consistently going after that.”
However, momentum soon changed after Acosta hit a go-ahead 3-run home run in the seventh inning during the Trojans second game against Utah Valley. The Trojans have managed to score a collective 13 runs in their past two games against Utah Valley and Long Beach State to continue their hot start to the season.
However, the Trojans’ biggest strength this season hasn’t been their hitting or their pitching, but their ability to grind out wins. 
While the Trojans have a lower batting average and fewer total hits than their opponents, they have still managed to score more runs than their competition. This could be due to the amount of walks the Trojans take. In their last game against Long Beach State, the Trojans were walked on six separate occasions while the Dirtbags were walked only twice. This allowed the Trojans to have more runners in scoring positions which ultimately changed the outcome of the game. Impressively, the Trojans managed to score 5 runs on only three hits because their players were able to get on base. 
In their next game, the Trojans will face off against a red-hot Villanova Wildcats team, who, according to their website, will be making their first ever trip to the state of California for a baseball game.
The Wildcats looked impressive in their opening series, scoring 29 runs while only allowing 6.
The Wildcats were able to sweep Norfolk State this season even after losing their best player from last season, Todd Czinege, to the MLB Draft.
“Anytime your best hitter leaves it would be a little comical to say your lineup got better, but believe it or not I do believe our lineup got better,” Villanova head coach Kevin Mulvey told The Villanovan prior to their series against Norfolk State.
As a team, the Wildcats are batting exceptionally well this season, batting over .300 so far while their opponents are only batting .165. Furthermore, the Wildcats’ pitching rotation has been lights out with an ERA of 2.00 while their opposing ERA is 6.67. Similarly to the Trojans, the Wildcats have been able to get on base without even getting hits as they have been walked a total of 20 times this season.
Following their series with the Wildcats, the Trojans will quickly face off against the NC Dinos on Monday and Loyola Marymount on Tuesday. Both games will take place at home at Dedeaux Field.

Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
There is a heuristic in human psychology called the peak-end rule. It’s a pretty logical, straightforward principle, which posits that people judge events based on basic criteria: the event’s “peak” — its most intense point, whether positive or negative — and its conclusion.
In sports, this phenomenon is even simpler because, as fans, the end of the event is almost always its peak. Sure, there are often plenty of incredible ups and downs throughout the middle, but it all culminates in that moment when the clock hits zero, the final out is made or what have you. Earlier this month, the Philadelphia Eagles scored a championship-defining trick-play touchdown to propel them over the New England Patriots. But as much as Birds fans may have enjoyed the Philly Special, the true peak came when Tom Brady’s Hail Mary fell to the turf incomplete and the Eagles won their first Super Bowl in franchise history.
By the same token, our memories of USC’s last football season peaked at its conclusion in Dallas, when we looked at the scoreboard reading 24-7 to Ohio State and realized that this anemic offensive effort marked Sam Darnold’s final start as a Trojan — that a season that had begun with hopes for a national championship had ended with USC getting outclassed in a de facto Rose Bowl. As unfair as it may be, the Trojans’ heroics against Texas, Utah and crosstown rival UCLA all went out the window. A four-month campaign was defined by three miserable hours.
But the peak-end rule can also be redemptive. It’s been a rough season so far for the USC men’s basketball team: The Trojans boast a strong 20-9 overall record and sit in second place in the Pac-12, but it has been a year marred by inconsistency, tough injuries and even tougher off-court distractions. USC is currently on the bubble for a spot in the NCAA tournament, and recent losses at UCLA, Arizona and Arizona State have turned a preseason Final Four dark horse into a potential NIT invite.
When suspended sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton announced on Wednesday that he was withdrawing from USC to pursue a professional career, it capped a week in which the Trojans also lost junior forward Bennie Boatwright to a knee injury for the rest of the season.
It’s not all doom and gloom, however. The team is currently riding a three-game winning streak (two of them coming sans Boatwright), and it has a chance to finish out the season very strongly with winnable games against Utah and UCLA remaining before the Pac-12 tournament. If they advance far in Las Vegas, the Trojans would undoubtedly be a strong candidate for a spot in March Madness.
They would be automatic qualifiers if they won the whole tourney — and in a season that at times teetered on disaster, USC’s first Pac-12 championship since 2009 would be nothing short of marvelous (given what the team has been through, plus its personnel shortage, anything beyond a berth in the NCAA tournament must be considered gravy). It would be fantastic to watch senior guard Jordan McLaughlin end his career with a conference title after he arrived in Los Angeles looking to lift a floundering program back into national relevance. And considering the state of the program when McLaughlin played his first game as a Trojan in 2014, it would be a miraculous turnaround — and one hell of a peak — to go from Pac-12 cellar dwellers to champions within just four years.
It’s doable, too. Every one of USC’s conference losses this season has been by single digits, save a 14-point loss at Arizona, which just lost star guard Allonzo Trier to suspension. The Trojans were actually weaker in Pac-12 play last year: They opened the campaign by going undefeated through their non-conference slate but then lost to Oregon (twice), Cal, Utah, Arizona (twice), UCLA and Arizona State. After all that, they still came within two games of playing in the championship game, dropping a narrow two-point loss to the third-ranked Bruins in the quarterfinals. In a weaker field than 2017’s, the Trojans have a very plausible path to glory this year.
No matter what happens, USC will never be able to shake the shadow of the Tony Bland-FBI scandal, which will hang over the program for many months to come. But with a strong finish to what many feared could be a lost campaign, the Trojans might just trick our minds into hoping — hoping that the team’s meteoric rise under head coach Andy Enfield remains on course, and that the difficult end to Melton’s collegiate career was an unfortunate one-off, not a harbinger of what’s to come.

For School of Cinematic Arts alumnus Aneesh Chaganty, the Sundance Film Festival held in Park City was more than just surprising — it was surreal. Within 24 hours of its premiere, Chaganty’s film, Search, received a distribution deal from Sony Pictures Worldwide, and by the end of the festival, it won the 2018 NEXT Audience Award.
The technology thriller, which was filmed from the point of view of smartphone and computer screens, follows a father who is trying to find his missing teenage daughter. Photo courtesy of Aneesh Chaganty.
“It was like fame for a week and a half,” Chaganty said. “Every restaurant we went into, every bar, every screening and every time we walked on the sidewalk, people would stop us and be like, ‘Hey, you guys made Search.’ It was an unreal experience.”
However, Chaganty said the film’s reception at Sundance has been long in the making. Search, a technological thriller about a father trying to find his missing 16-year-old daughter, began as an idea between Chaganty and his writing partner Sev Ohanian in fall 2015. Ohanian, who graduated with an MFA from SCA in 2012, now works as an adjunct professor at USC and met Chaganty in a film production class. 
“He had a lot of creative energy to him and he seemed to have really smart ideas in class,” Ohanian said. “Most of all, he just gave off this vibe of really being like a hustler.”
When Ohanian was approached by Google to make a short film using Google Glass, he knew he wanted Chaganty by his side. 
“I wanted to build their reputation for myself as one of those producers who would love taking on challenges,” Ohanian said. “Any time somebody had a film that they wanted to direct that was kind of over the top or really ambitious or almost reckless, I would always immediately sign up.”
The team shot a short film titled Seeds entirely on Google Glass, which quickly went viral. The film also grabbed the attention of officials from Blumhouse Productions, the creators of Unfriended, a 2015 horror film that took place entirely on computer screens. 
Ohanian and Chaganty were invited to pitch a short film to the company, and developed the idea for Search, placing a family thriller in the same computer screen format that Unfriended was shot in. When Blumhouse offered to finance a feature-length version, Chaganty originally declined, but Ohanian encouraged him to take the offer.
“I told them that what Aneesh means by no is that we’ll get back to you guys,” Ohanian said.
After several months, the duo started writing a screenplay and assembling a team of editors and producers for the film, most of whom were USC alumni. 
“Search is really a USC mafia production, more than anything I’ve ever worked on,” said USC alumna Natalie Qasabian, who worked on the film as a producer. “It was honestly pretty incredible to have so many USC grads on a really collaborative movie.”
Ohanian said that collaboration was the key to the movie’s production, as its unusual narrative style required extensive editing and careful planning. Before lead actors John Cho and Debra Messing arrived on set, the production team had already created a rough cut of the film with Chaganty playing every role to plan out the various websites, chat windows and popups that tell the story in advance. 
After filming wrapped, Qasabian, Chaganty, Ohanian and editors Will Merrick and Nick Johnson worked together in one editing room for nearly two years.
When Search finally premiered in January, the team was thrilled just to put their project out into the world, although they did not expect the dramatic response they received at Sundance. 
“We made the movie with five people in single edit room and all of a sudden on our premiere night to have 550 people watching that movie on a screen way larger than the iMacs that we edited the movie on is already enough of a surreal experience,” Chaganty said.
When the film was picked up by Sony, awarded the Alfred P. Sloan Prize for using engineering in film and chosen as an audience favorite, Ohanian said that the intense amount of work put into the film had finally paid off. 
Ohanian said that one of the best moments after the film’s release was receiving a compliment from the SCA Dean Elizabeth Daley at a staff meeting. 
“She said that it really warmed [her] heart to see that these students are such a team,” Ohanian said.
The production team is currently in talks with distribution and marketing departments and plans to hold a nationwide premiere for the film by the end of 2018. They also plan on hosting a large screening on campus.
 “I remember sitting in [the Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre] a billion times a week as a critical studies student, and just being really pumped for the day that I could come in and screen a movie of my own,” Qasabian said.

Many free online apps are available to students including the Microsoft Office suite which became available to all current students beginning in the summer of 2015. In an email sent out by Chief Information Officer Doug Shook to all students Feb. 21, Information Technology Services announced they will be expanding the free apps available. 
USC is offering Microsoft OneDrive as part of an initiative to increase campus technological resources. Photo courtesy of Microsoft OneDrive.
Students now have access to Microsoft OneDrive and Skype for Business accounts. OneDrive for Business in an online file-hosting service which allows students to have up to five terabytes of storage for files. Asbed Bedrossian, director of Enterprise Middleware Applications, said these services are a part of an initiative spearheaded by Shook to go toward increased technological resources across the campus. 
OneDrive uses the native Microsoft format for the Microsoft Suite. This allows students to avoid converting files from other online programs such as Google Drive. Office productivity applications allow students and faculty members to store their work documents and share with anyone who has a Microsoft account. 
Director of ITS Organizational Initiatives and Communications Leyla Ezdinli explained how the addition of OneDrive was advocated for by students and faculty. “ITS has received requests from students and faculty and staff for students to have access to OneDrive to simplify, share and collaborate on files,” she said. 
To optimize the backup and storage process, desktop and mobile apps are available for student use. The USC ITS’ website details how to access and use the OneDrive for Business apps in addition to other online storage options available. Other Microsoft Office 365 apps are now also available to students.
Another new tool available for students to encourage collaboration is Skype for Business. According to USC ITS, Skype for Business is a web conferencing platform that enables web conferencing, instant messaging and screen document sharing. This service allows users to call each other on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices. 
This interface has the potential to form enterprise ties and facilitated access to students and faculty members at the University in the future. Bedrossian envisions that “in the university environment [these new technologies] can connect everybody [to] do [the] workflows.”

There’s something entirely magical about learning a different language such as being able to understand the nuances of a culture, or trying to get a grasp on things that are lost in translation. Learning a language is the most fundamental way to understand a different culture, but of course, also one of the most difficult.
For seven years, throughout middle school and high school, I learned Mandarin Chinese. “Learned” is a strong word — rather, I struggled through it. And when I say struggled, I mean it. Chinese was consistently my hardest subject. Even after practicing a character 30 times, I still would forget a little stroke in the corner. After repeating the pinyin — or pronunciation of the Chinese word using English phonetics — to myself in my head repeatedly, I would still mix up the second and third tones. There were countless moments when I wanted to quit, and every year, before I had to make my course selection to move onto the next level of Chinese, I said to myself, “Am I really doing this for another year?” I questioned my ability to learn new languages, and I constantly wondered and wondered if I was just bad at learning languages, or if I was bad at learning Chinese. 
My teacher tried to assure me that it was neither, and that everyone had things that they found easier and harder when tackling something so unfamiliar. But it often didn’t feel that way. 
No matter how difficult it became, every time I was ready to quit, I found myself pulled back. There was something incredibly rewarding about unraveling the mysteries of an unfamiliar language. I loved the satisfaction of having a productive and substantive conversation about politics in Mandarin. I loved trying to overhear and understand the conversations I heard in grocery store lines. And most of all, I loved the immediate connection that was formed with a Mandarin speaker when I tried to speak with them in their native language. The smile on their face made the struggle worth it, and their immediate warmth was palpable.

One of my favorite instances of this was when I did a homestay in rural village near Lijiang, China, during my junior year of high school. We were warned that our homestay hosts may not speak Mandarin, let alone English, and they often only conversed in their local dialect. But I entered the house and my homestay mother immediately welcomed me with open arms, clearly as nervous as I was. The moment I began to speak in Mandarin, hoping with all my heart that there would be some understanding, her face broke into a smile, and the ice was immediately broken. She didn’t understand everything we said, and we certainly didn’t understand everything she said, but the bridge had been built and that was the most important. 
I am hoping to study abroad in Shanghai next spring, and I am beyond excited for more experiences like this. My trip to China — the homestay, speaking to shopkeepers in Shanghai and even speaking with international students here at USC — have made me appreciate my seven years of Chinese language education more than ever before. I constantly tell my friends that next on my “list” to learn are Spanish and Arabic. No matter how difficult, the experiences I’ve gained and the connections I’ve made through my fluency remind me of the doors that learning a language can open. 
I hope that one day the American education system will make language classes a priority. At a time when cultural competency is more important than ever, languages are, in my opinion, the best way to build bridges. Not only is the physical act of communication incredibly important, but learning a language also shows investment and effort into another culture. Learning Mandarin was one of the most difficult parts of my time in middle and high school, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything. The impact it has had on my education, my career goals and my world view are larger than I could have hoped for, and I’m ready and more than willing to do it all over again with another language.

Schneider’s landscape photographs and tea bag installations are inspired by her family and hometown in South Carolina. Photo by Wanting He | Daily Trojan
Brooke Schneider’s first solo exhibition, My Wound Is My Geography, teleports viewers to another land: one both foreign and familiar, vast and compact, deserted yet abundant with life. Stoic tree trunks, cozy wooden houses, abandoned rubble and twigs were buried in the landscape — these works, created over the course of two years, are only several in a sea of thousands of photos taken by Schneider, a senior majoring in the fine arts. Dynamic angles and earthy hues of brown, green and gray not only allow viewers to be onlookers of the land, but also to reflect upon its history and the people who have shaped it. 
My Wound Is My Geography was on display at the Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery in the USC Roski School of Art and Design until Thursday, Feb. 22. 
In an age where photos are digital and seemingly transient, Schneider shoots on film. She has a hands-on photography approach — personal and multidimensional — to represent her memories of South Carolina, the state she calls home. Along with her works, attendees are greeted at the door with an eloquent personal statement about the exhibition. 
“There are ties that bind me to a more profound sense of place,” Schneider wrote in a statement printed in a stack by the exhibit entrance. “The union between the discreet beauty of the South, the people, my family and their trials within the landscape, is vital to my understanding of place.” 
Schneider’s work is not only centered on the South Carolina landscape, but also on the sense of loss that accompanies the passing of time.
“Constructing narratives are both a mode of place making and a mode of coping with loss — the loss of time, memory, people and proximity,” she said. “Land is invariable while time is fleeting.”
When asked what she misses most about home, Schneider cited the land, the pace, the way of life and the value of tradition. 
“[It] breathes a different way than being in the city does,” she said. In Los Angeles, her current residence, there tends to be a gravitation toward what is happening in the future, Schneider said, whereas the culture of the South is more concerned with nostalgia, sentimentality and the past. 
The photos in the exhibition are mostly landscapes — glimpses into the living, breathing trove of Schneider’s memory bank. Some are zoomed-in explorations of fields and branches, such as “Studied by Flowers,” while others are more expansive shots of a wider area, as is the case with “In Search Of Lost Time.” 
The setting in this piece is a family farm built over a century ago, a place she considers a sanctuary and a safe haven. 
As for Schneider’s approach to photography, none of her photos are planned. In this way, her art is documentative. She attributes her inspiration to a particular feeling that arises when she knows she has to take a picture. One gets the sense that she is thus naturally in-tune with the land, constantly inspired by it, and perhaps even indebted to it. 
“There’s something about growing up in a place and feeling so much loyalty to that place,” Schneider said.
Photography is not, however, the only artistic medium evident in the exhibit. There are also four hanging installations, each crafted by hand in 2017 and comprised entirely of tea bags and linen thread. “A Lover’s Introduction,” “Quicksilver Childhood,” “Worshipful Son” and “If You Have a Father or if You Haven’t One” are pieces — when examined more closely — stamped with images of people from Schneider’s family history. The works were not intentionally created to be placed side by side with the photographs. They did, however, come together naturally.
“All the work that I make, it’s about the same thing,” Schneider said. “It’s about sense of place, it’s about family, it’s about tradition, loss, romance.”
Described as a progression of her great grandparents’ and grandfather’s stories, these Lipton tea bag constructions tell the story of tragedy, reclamation and intergenerational relationships. The textile industry is a dominating force in her hometown, and Schneider’s use of textile materials to physically craft images was a fitting medium for the artist to to display her narrative. Wanting to honor the experiences of the people that live within the landscape she so reveres, Schneider used ink to press on impressions of old family photos. 
Her family members are not only the inspirations behind and the faces upon the fabric of the pieces, but they are also the physical sources of the materials used to construct them. 
“My family will send me their used tea bags,” she said. 
This attention to the artistic process is something that Schneider refuses to abandon. The acts of physically sourcing, physically sewing and physically involving her family in the process come from the same place that prompts her physical approach to creating and printing photos. This hands-on creation parallels the physicality of her devotion and value to time, place and memory. 
None of these works were created specifically for this exhibition. Trips spent back home in South Carolina over summers and holiday vacations constantly involved shooting. Schneider had intended for these thousands of photos to form the basis of a book she is currently working on, a portion of which will be her own writings. An avid reader, Schneider reveres Pat Conroy and Marcel Proust, both writers who are captivated by the nature of time.
The photographs in the show may not explicitly include people, but their imprints upon the land are very present within each frame, such as in “Somewhere Only We Know” (2018). These landscapes are far from desolate. Though they reflect upon loss, they touch on archetypes like home and shelter, and are thus, through the heavy veil of memory that coats them, familiar. These archetypes are what Schneider describes as “little touchstones” for people to relate their own experiences to. 
When asked if she believes it is possible to remember something objectively, Schneider responded that she does not think it is, for so much of her own memory is rooted in emotion. A feeling overwhelmingly present in these photos: loss. The loss of people, time and proximity to the land that has built who she is. 
“Loss sets the stage for the South that I know, at least,” she said. 
Schneider’s works are earthy scenes immortalized through her eyes, the eyes of someone deeply involved in and enamored with what they capture. Addressing notions of isolation, longevity, familiarity and history, these works establish the past, memory and nostalgia not as things fleeting or weak, but as the powerful and very real sensations which inform who a person is and how they see the world.
