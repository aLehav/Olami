The number of interns expected to be hired for full-time positions at the end of this summer has increased, according to a report released by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.
The report predicts an 8.5 percent increase in the hiring of interns for full-time positions, while the average hourly wage for undergraduate interns is expected to decrease by 27 cents to $16.21 per hour.
Carl Martellino, director of USC Career Center, said internships have become essential for students looking for full-time employment.
“Employers are looking for students with not only a degree, but relevant experience,” Martellino said. “Internships are becoming the ‘new interview,’ where companies can see if [an intern] is a good fit to work for them.”
Sam Sagartz, a freshman majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, said internships are important because they provide hands-on experience that is not available in the classroom.
“Internships are crucial in readying students for the workforce,” Sagartz said. “They give students an opportunity to not only see how their field operates, but also to interact with professionals in that field and gain practical experience.”
Michael Vazquez, a senior majoring in American studies and health promotion and disease prevention studies, said cross-disciplinary internships can also be helpful.
“Internships are important, because they allow you to apply what you’ve learned in the class,” Vazquez said. “My internship was business-related, and even though I’m not a business major, I felt like I could apply the things I learned.”
To help students find internships, the Career Center runs the university’s Connect SC program, which provides information on companies in the Los Angeles area looking for students to hire. USC has also enrolled, along with other colleges such as Harvard and Georgetown, in an iNet program that facilitates summer internships, Martellino said.

Miscellaneous incidents
at 1:58 a.m. on March 6, DPS officers responded to a report of an intoxicated non-USC male causing a disturbance at the Radisson Hotel and detained him for investigation. The officers attempted to release the male to his father, but because of the subject’s continued loud and violent behavior they concluded that his father would not be able to control him. The male was then arrested and transported to 77th Station for booking.
at 12:01 p.m. on March 5, DPS officers responded to USC Law Library at the location and delivered “stay away” letters to a non-USC male and a non-USC female whose behavior has generated numerous complaints from students and staff. The subjects stated that they understood the contents of the letters and the officers escorted them off campus without further incident.
At 10:15 a.m. on March 5, DPS officers responded to a student who was hit by a truck while crossing the street near the Hoffman Contracts Research Building. The student complained of pain in his arm and leg, so an LAFD RA unit was requested. RA Unit #15 responded and examined the student, then transported him to California Hospital for medical treatment. LAPD officers were also requested and responded to conduct a traffic investigation. The driver of the truck did not stop to identify himself or check on the welfare of the student.
at 8:13 p.m. on March 4, a non-USC male flagged down DPS officers on routine patrol and informed them that three juveniles attempted to rob his grandson of an iPod near Subway. The male could not provide any additional information because he did not witness the incident and the officers were advised not to contact the grandson or his mother because they did not desire an investigation.
at 2:55 p.m. on March 4, a staff member reported that he confronted a suspect who was observed driving a university electric cart without authorization near Dedeaux Field and the subject fled on foot. The staff member additionally stated that he observed a second suspect in a second cart, but neither suspect could be located during a subsequent search of the area by DPS officers.
at 6:01 p.m. on March 2, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated student who passed out at a table inside Panda Express. The student was coherent when contacted by the officers and they observed that he had a small contusion to his forehead. The student stated that he sustained the injury when his head hit the table, but he declined medical treatment and was subsequently released.
at 1:50 p.m. on March 2, a staff member reported that a student informed her that she had been sexually assaulted on Menlo Avenue. DPS officers subsequently interviewed the student and she stated that the staff member had misunderstood her and that she had been verbally assaulted, not sexually assaulted. LAPD officers also interviewed the student and they concluded that no crime had occurred.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate considered resolutions Tuesday advocating the creation and expansion of gender-neutral accommodations for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students, and considered a resolution regarding Leavey Library’s renovation.
The Senate unanimously passed a resolution proposing a pilot program for gender-neutral housing and tabled a resolution calling for a gender-neutral bathroom in the Student Union.

Resolutions serve as USG’s formal method of communicating the collective opinion of the student body to the administration.
The Senate unanimously chose to defer a vote on the gender-neutral bathroom resolution for two weeks because it was based off a survey with a small sample size of 94 students.
“My concern is not on the issue itself,” said USG Senate Pro Tempore and Vice President-elect Vinnie Prasad during discussion of the resolution. “The purpose of a resolution is to represent the entire student body. We believe that most students want this, but we can’t say that we know.”
Some students said they believe gender-neutral bathrooms are unnecessary.
“I don’t really see the need for it if there are already men’s bathrooms and women’s bathrooms,” said Craig Handy, a senior majoring in business administration.
Residential Sen. Keshav Tyagi, who authored the gender-neutral bathroom resolution, said, however, the bathrooms are necessary in making the campus a more comfortable environment for transgender students.
Tyagi said he is in favor of tabling the resolution to gather more survey responses. Three to four senators will volunteer to serve on a committee to elicit more input on the gender-neutral housing issue, USG Vice President Logan Lachman said.
The gender-neutral housing resolution, which the Senate passed unanimously, proposes a pilot program on the Rainbow Floor, a special interest community for LGBT students and allies in Century Apartments.
Many students said such a program would benefit participants without hindering those who do not partake.
“It could please a lot of people and it wouldn’t affect other people if they didn’t want to participate in it,” said Amanda Mitchell, a freshman majoring in international relations.
During the meeting, Greek Sen. Andres Guarnizo-Ospina introduced a resolution in support of a renovation plan for Leavey Library. According to the resolution, an architectural firm conducted an assessment of a possible Leavey renovation last summer. In addition, Dean of Libraries Catherine Quinlan hosted focus groups with students, faculty and staff.
“The renovation is hopefully something that students will be interested in doing,” Guarnizo-Ospina said. “A lot of people think Leavey is outdated, from what I can gather.”
The Leavey Library resolution will be voted on after spring break.
Aren’t these bathrooms really for hooking up?
Marrisa:
Sit up straight girl!  Your posture is terrible!
Mike – If this isn’t a pressing issue, what is? Take 15 minutes and educate yourself: http://www.neontommy.com/news/2011/12/trans-story
Instead of addressing more pressing issues, our USG is wasting time on gender neutral bathrooms? Way to put students’ fees to work guys…
I don’t understand why it matters whether the majority of students think we need the restrooms or not. When did we get to vote on whether we need men’s and women’s restrooms? It is a human’s right to have a restroom that they can use with dignity.
Also, they’re only asking for ONE! Could you imagine only having one bathroom you could to go to on campus every time you needed to relieve yourself? How inconvenient! They really are not asking for much–just equal treatment by the university for a basic need.
“I really don’t see the need for it if there are already men’s bathrooms and women’s bathrooms” — this is exactly why we must continue to educate the USC community and gender identity/expression issues.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum gained the most delegates for the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday, garnering 183 and 64 votes respectively.
Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich also clinched his home state of Georgia, adding to a total of 52 delegates for the night, and Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who has the fewest total delegates of any contender for the nomination, won no delegates.
All four candidates fall short of the 1,144 delegates needed to secure the nomination for president, while 1,700  delegates remain.
As of 11 p.m. Tuesday, Romney lead the pack with 320, Santorum followed at 140, Gingrich earned 75 and Paul secured 35.
Romney told a crowd in Boston that his campaign team took the night as a victory.
“We’re counting up the delegates and we’re counting down the days until November,” Romney said. “We’re going to get a huge victory tonight in Massachusetts and take that victory all the way to the White House.”
Romney touted his experience in business and criticized President Barack Obama’s handling of the economy, pledging to cut, cap and balance the national budget and create jobs.
“The debts today are too high and the jobs are too few,” Romney said. “We’ve seen enough of the president over the last three years to know we don’t need another five. This president’s run out of ideas, he’s run out of excuses and, in 2012, we’re going to get him out of office.”
Romney said he learned how government should work during his time as governor of Massachusetts.
“I know how government kills jobs and I know how government can create jobs,” Romney said.
Santorum also targeted Obama as he addressed supporters from a high school gymnasium in Steubenville, Ohio. He said he would come from behind to get the GOP nomination.
“We’re going to win a few, we’re going to lose a few,” Santorum said. “We’re going to get at least a few gold medals and a whole bunch of silver medals.”
Santorum stressed the geographic diversity of his majority wins in Iowa, Colorado, Minnesota and Tennessee.
“We have won in the West, the Midwest and the South,” Santorum said. “We’re ready to win across this country.”
He said “the straw that broke the camel’s back” that caused him to run was Obama’s health care legislation, which he said violates the Constitution.
“This is an election about fundamental liberties and the signature piece of legislation, with economic rights created by the government to force you to buy insurance, to buy policies you don’t want and to pay for coverage that violates your faith convictions,” Santorum said.
Gingrich attacked Romney in his stump speech, as he told supporters in the Renaissance Atlanta Waverly Hotel that his win of Georgia shows that he had defeated “the national elite, especially in the Republican party.” Though he’s about 150 delegates behind the frontrunner nominee, Gingrich said he should be the GOP nominee because Romney would not be able to out-fundraise Obama.
“I am the one candidate who has the ability to debate Barack Obama decisively,” Gingrich said. “I don’t believe outspending your opponent five to one with negative ads is going to win the presidency.”
Gingrich said Romney’s campaign, which has spent nearly $56 million, ran slanderous advertisements.
“It’s one thing to have lots of money,” Gingrich said. “It’s another thing to lie with lots of money.”
Meanwhile, politically active students on campus are beginning to gear up to work on the 2012 election. The members of USC College Republicans and USC College Democrats plan to help campaign for their respective party’s nominee in the coming months.
College Republicans will begin actively campaigning once the GOP chooses a candidate, said Alex Kludjian, public relations director for College Republicans. The group is currently working to increase its membership.
“The Republican club used to be one of the prominent clubs on campus and we want to re-establish that place [at] school,” Kludjian said. “We’re hoping to help properly inform people and advocate on campus.”
College Democrats Political Director Kaya Masler founded Students for Barack Obama to help channel support for the incumbent president.
“USC is considered the hub for Students for Barack Obama,” Masler said. “USC and UCSB are spearheading the project, making calls to the community and creating awareness on campus.”

With one conference win in 18 tries and a 6-25 record overall, the USC men’s basketball team didn’t achieve much success during the 2011-2012 regular season. In fact, in addition to finishing last in the Pac-12, the Trojans posted their worst win/loss percentage in school history and tied their 1977 counterparts for fewest victories in a single season.
But on Wednesday, they’ll have a chance to start anew in their opening-round game of the Pac-12 tournament against UCLA. USC enters the tournament as the No. 12 seed, and the Bruins, who ended up as the No. 5 seed, are the highest-seeded team to not receive a first-round bye — finishing behind Washington, Cal, Oregon and Arizona, respectively.
Upset minded · Though they are 6-25, freshman guard Byron Wesley and the Trojans believe they can be competitive against rival UCLA. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
“I’m happy that’s how we get to start off, because we want to get a win against them,” sophomore forward Garrett Jackson said of UCLA. “We lost to them twice previously.”
The Bruins (18-13, 11-7) first defeated USC on Jan. 15, by a score of 66-47, and beat them again on Feb. 15, 64-54. Guard Lazeric Jones led the team in scoring with an average of 13.4 points, 4.2 assists and 1.8 steals per game during the regular season. Jones also got plenty of help from his frontcourt — forward brothers Travis and David Wear both averaged more than 10 points per contest, as did center Josh Smith.
“UCLA is playing the best they’ve played all year right now,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “Let’s face it — when we go through warm-ups, it will be obvious which team should win the game. To me, other than North Carolina, they have the best frontline in the country.”
The Trojans will attempt to counter UCLA’s talent with what’s left of their roster — USC only has six healthy players on scholarship. Still, O’Neill expects a spirited performance from his team.
“I think our guys are going to be motivated just to play,” O’Neill said. “Regardless of who we’re playing on the other side, I would hope that our team responds with a great effort. And I think they will.”
Jackson, who contributed 15 points, four steals and three blocks in his last matchup against the crosstown Bruins, knows what’s needed for his team to have a chance.
“We definitely have to get in front of their post guys and limit their post touches,” Jackson said. “Put pressure on their outside guys, make it tough to get it inside.”
O’Neill, meanwhile, offered a more general outline of what it might take to pull off an upset win.
“If they’re on their game, it’s going to be difficult to beat them,” O’Neill said. “We’re going to try to do what we did over in their place and try to make it an eight-point game with five minutes left and hopefully steal one. That’s our goal and that’s what we’re going to have to do.”
Tipoff is set for 2:30 p.m. at the Staples Center. The game will be broadcast on Fox Sports Net.

No. 5 USC men’s swimming and diving team and No. 7 women’s swimming and diving team join forces to begin their journeys to the NCAA championships with the NCAA Zone Diving Championships at the United States Air Force Academy in Fort Collins, Colo., from Thursday to Saturday.
Both teams are coming off strong finishes in the Pac-12 championships, with the women’s team finishing third and the men’s team finishing fourth.
The women are led by senior Victoria Ishimatsu, who is coming off her fourth-straight Pac-12 3-meter title and her third straight 1-meter title. Ishimatsu closed out the 2012 Pac-12 championships with a second-place finish in platform. Freshman Jessica Warren also took seventh in the event.
The men’s side is headed by freshman Jordan Gear, who had three finals appearances in the Pac-12 Men’s Diving Championships, including a fourth-place finish in the platform final, and freshman Cody Walwick, who appeared in two finals events.
The events start Thursday with the women’s 1-meter prelims and finals and the men’s 3-meter prelims and finals.
What you talkin’ about Salo. Men finished fourth in the conference championships and are ranked fifth in the nation.
Only one other team in the country ranked ahead of the Trojans outside their own conference. Give me a break.

Don’t be fooled by the uncharacteristic heat wave that has been making its way through Southern California; it’s March, not August. Nonetheless, spring football is officially upon us, and this year the stakes are just a little bit higher.
In previous years, spring football focused on ushering in a new coaching staff, postseason bans and the growth of a still-evolving quarterback.
Not so in 2012.
The coaching staff is rock solid, maybe even more so now than when the Trojans last took the field in December.
The ban is lifted, leaving room for the possibility of not just a bowl game, but the national championship.
And that blond, blue-eyed quarterback hasn’t just evolved into a USC Trojan of whom we can all be proud, he’s evolved into the nation’s premier quarterback.
But with the air of good feeling that now envelops Howard Jones Field, questions still remain.
Either way, I intend to answer a few of them.
What’s the rallying point this spring?
The previous two USC squads bonded over this “us against the world” mentality. This year that attitude would be misguided. If anything, those that live and work outside the confines of Troy are almost unanimously predicting Lane Kiffin’s squad to do big things in 2012.
The rallying point — oddly enough — is embracing that praise, but recognizing it means nothing without work being done on the field. Several of the players on the current roster have gotten a taste of what high expectations feel like come next fall. But none of them have ever experienced the whirlwind they are about to enter.
The 2011 team was beloved not just for its knack of making big plays at key moments, but because it played like a family, like the representatives we want for our university.
That can’t change just because the metaphorical storm clouds are gone.
Can Lane Kiffin handle the pressure?
Taking over for Pete Carroll? Check. Guiding a sanctioned team through a highly successful season? Check. Changing the media’s perception? Check.
In two years, Kiffin has not only answered the Victory Bell, he’s made it his own. Not only has he matured and transformed as a coach, but he’s found a way to put his stamp on a program that needed a facelift.
But at no point in his time with the Raiders or at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville did Kiffin enter a season with quite the level of expectations he and his team now face.
It’s a great problem to have and if the recent additions to his résumé serve as a reference point, the moment won’t ever be too big for the 36-year-old.
What’s left for Barkley?
If we’re really going to compare Matt Barkley to the likes of Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart, there are two pieces of hardware that still need to make their way onto Barkley’s mantle: the Heisman Trophy and the national championship trophy.
On top of that, and maybe more important to his future, the USC coaching staff needs to test him as much as physically possible in pro-style situations.
It’s hard to knock a guy who has meant so much to this university, but if Barkley wants to be an instant contributor on an NFL roster, now is as good a time as any to work on polishing his decision-making skills and accuracy issues downfield.
Who’s going to be the next offensive X-factor?
It’s hard to be look to future stars when the Trojans return a Heisman candidate behind center, four starters along the offensive line, the top wide receiving duo in all of college football, two very capable red zone threats at tight end and a 1,000-yard halfback, but part of becoming a great team is getting production where you’d least expect it.
Last spring, no one knew that a slew of redshirt freshmen (Dion Bailey, Hayes Pullard, Xavier Grimble and Randall Telfer) would not only start but thrive when given the opportunity.
Even more relevant to the point, no one thought senior Curtis McNeal — a running back who had missed more games than he had played before 2011 — would make a meaningful impact last year, to such an extent that fans were once again reminded why USC was long considered Running Back U.
This year’s crop of characters could be anyone from freshman Nelson Agholor to dual-threat George Farmer to the tremendously talented, yet overshadowed wideout, Victor Blackwell from Mater Dei High School to Javorious “Buck” Allen.
What happens between the white lines while most of you are soaking up the sun in Cabo or relaxing with family members watching the NCAA tournament may not matter to you too much, but it should. The BCS Championship will be won on the second Monday next January, but it will be earned in settings like the one that will take place over the next few weeks.

USC baseball’s seven-game win streak to begin the 2012 season was aided largely by high scoring innings. On Tuesday night at Dedeaux Field, the Trojans got another big frame but had to withstand an early barrage of runs.
They did, overcoming Cal State Fullerton’s  four-run fifth inning to escape with a 7-4 victory.  The Trojans scored the last seven runs of the ballgame, with the two biggest coming courtesy on Kevin Roundtree’s two-RBI single that gave USC its first lead of the night.

The win moves USC to 9-3 on the season heading into a weekend series with Cal State Bakersfield.
“Even when we fell behind, we were confident,” USC head coach Frank Cruz said. “We felt like we were going to take good at-bats and get ourselves back in the game. The big thing is that everyone trusts their teammates, and we had to work as a team to come back.”
Tuesday starter Brandon Garcia no-hit the Titans through four innings but fell victim to a string of singles and an RBI triple by Richy Pedroza in the fifth that gave Fullerton a 4-0 lead. Garcia finished the frame but gave way to the bullpen immediately following.
“Brandon pitched real well to start off but he might have lost a little gas,” Cruz said. “If anything, it was my fault for leaving him in there a little too long. Once that happened, we needed to hold them the rest of the way.”
USC’s relievers did just that, keeping Fullerton at bay while the offense finally broke through against Fullerton starter Koby Gauna and several arms out of the Titans bullpen. USC’s James Guillen, Brad Douthit (who picked up his first win of the year), Wyatt Strahan and Friday starter Andrew Triggs combined to shut out the Titans on one hit over the last four innings.
“I put Triggs in because he begged me,” Cruz said of the decision to close out the game with his staff ace. “He told me his arm felt great and that he’d only need a few pitches.”
The pitchers were aided by their defense, as well. Senior right fielder Alex Sherrod made a diving catch in the seventh to rob Fullerton’s Michael Lorenzen of extra bases, and junior second baseman Adam Landecker virtually went into the Trojan bullpen from his second base position to make a sliding catch in foul territory.
“We’re a very good defensive team,” Cruz said. “If you look at the stats, we’re fielding at a very high percentage. And we played like it out there tonight.”
The Trojans came into the game with a .980 fielding percentage, making only eight errors in the team’s first 12 games.
At the plate, USC began to rally from the 4-0 deficit with two runs in the sixth. Senior catcher Kevin Roundtree’s fielder’s choice got the Trojans on the board, and Kevin Swick’s sac fly drew them to within two.
Then the USC offense really got going. Freshman catcher Garrett Stubbs’ lone hit of the night scored Omar Cotto to pull the Trojans to within one. With one out, back-to-back singles from Sherrod and senior infielder Matt Foat set the stage for Roundtree’s clutch    at-bat.
Roundtree, who had grounded into a fielder’s choice with the bases loaded the sixth, was determined to come through in the seventh against Fullerton’s freshman right-hander Willie Kuhl.
“He threw me a good curveball first pitch, so I was actually thinking off speed the next pitch,” the Trojans’ catcher said. “Then he threw a fastball in, and luckily I was able to get a pretty good piece of it and pull it down the line.”
Garcia, in the game as a pinch hitter after being removed from the mound, then knocked in Roundtree to close out the scoring. When all was said and done, USC had 14 hits, all but one of them singles.
“We’ve been battle-tested this year, especially after going up against a team like North Carolina,” Roundtree said. “When we were behind, the atmosphere stayed the same, and that’s a strength of this club.”

As the Trojans entered Howard Jones Field for the first time in nearly three months, a lot of things looked different than when they left it last December.
Tee Martin is now a member of USC coach Lane Kiffin’s staff, coaching the wide receivers.
Gone are tackle Matt Kalil and defensive end Nick Perry.
Great expectations · Sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee is one of several Trojans expected to lead the Trojans to their first bowl game since 2009. USC finished 2011 with a 10-2 record, including a win over Oregon. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
But there were three constants that remained on the field Tuesday afternoon from last season that give Trojans everywhere a reason to be hopeful for the 2012 season: the return of senior quarterback Matt Barkley and his wide receivers, junior Robert Woods and sophomore Marqise Lee.
Many thought that Barkley had played his last game in cardinal and gold in the 50-0 victory over UCLA. But Barkley, who threw 39 touchdowns last season against just seven interceptions, decided to come back for his senior season, citing “unfinished business” as his reason for returning.
“It’s amazing. I’m glad he came back,” said Lee, who recorded more than 1,000 yards receiving and 11 touchdowns in his first season on campus. “We’re gonna enjoy him while we [can].”
With the return of Barkley, however, comes raised expectations. USC is being widely hailed as a preseason  top-five team, with some analysts saying the Trojans are the best team in the country.
The Trojans are not concerned with that, however, if Tuesday is any indication.
“We don’t really think about [the expectations],” Lee said. “We just know we’re supposed to come out here and work hard. That’s the main mindset for us. And that’s what we focus on.”
Though Barkley, Woods and Lee all return, Kalil will no longer be manning Barkley’s blindside. In his place is redshirt junior Kevin Graf, who started at right tackle last season.
Kalil is expected to be a top-five pick in the coming NFL draft and was an All-American selection last season. Though many eyes are on Graf this spring, he said he does not feel pressure replacing a marquee player like Kalil.
“He’s a great player. I’m really happy for him, that he’s going so high,” Graf said. “But I’m trying to be a great player here too.”
The high expectations are not getting the best of Graf, either.
“That’s where we want to be. That’s where we want to be focused at,” Graf explained. “We always want to be at the top, and we’re happy about that.”
The Trojans will practice again on Thursday and Saturday and will then have a week off for spring break.

When you watch the characters in The Hangover consume alcohol, does that prompt you to binge drink in your own life?
An international study says so, but concrete reality begs to differ.
In a study published in the Official Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday, researchers from Europe and the United States surveyed students from six different countries, aged 10- to 19- years- old, to find out if there is a correlation between the presence of alcohol in popular movies and the likelihood of binge drinking during adolescence.
Students were presented with a random selection of 50 movies, all of which were among the 250 most successful movies in their respective countries for the past two years. The students were also asked the old adage to quantify binge drinking: “How often have you had five or more drinks of alcohol on one occasion?” The study reported that overall 27 percent had consumed the “five or more” drinks on at least one occasion.
After controlling for age, gender, family affluence, school performance, television screen time, sensation seeking and rebelliousness, as well as drinking habits of peers, parents and siblings, the researchers concluded that there is a significant link.
How can these factors be completely left out of the equation? Each element plays a crucial role in our decision and likelihood to drink, arguably much more than seeing a couple cosmopolitans tossed back in Abu Dhabi in Sex and the City 2.
Correlation is not causation. Studies like these step over important aspects of binge drinking that deserve attention and research.
The study also seeks to establish that adolescent binge drinking is a cross-cultural problem, which is worth more attention than the supposed “correlation” with drinking in movies. Clearly, binge drinking is a systemic problem in the Western world. Though the United States’ higher drinking age is often blamed for our culture of binge drinking, the phenomenon isn’t confined to this side of the Atlantic.
In short: Keep watching The Hangover. You probably won’t become an alcoholic.

Food trucks are lovely things. Normal restaurants are usually more well-regarded than food trucks because of their stability, but these trucks are much more accessible because of their ability to move.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
Migrating from sidewalk to sidewalk and offering a variety of cuisines, food trucks are a surging industry in Los Angeles. Just walk along the streets surrounding USC to see how popular and varied this fleet has become.
In Los Angeles County, 2,650 trucks are registered with the Southern California Mobile Food Vendor’s Association, and the numbers are increasing. The industry has been boosted by the growth of Twitter, which allows fans of specific food trucks to receive constant updates on their routes.
As with any growing movement, however, there are those who see danger in the change.
California State Assemblyman William Monning sees food trucks as threats against nutrition.
Monning has introduced a bill that would forbid food trucks from parking within 1,500 feet of elementary schools, middle schools and high schools between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on school days. The bill is designed to counter the threat food trucks pose to the health of California.
Monning claims the trucks are targeting children: By offering low-cost, high-sodium foods close to schools, they are raising the rates of childhood obesity and diabetes.
Monning’s worries are valid, but he is combating them in a curious way. Child health issues definitely need to be addressed; measures banning soda from school vending machines and introducing healthier food choices are steps in the right direction. Still, this proposed bill is different.
This bill is not controlling what happens to schools, but rather small businesses, which are independent of the government. They are being punished as if they are criminals, having their available areas for setting up shop cut and diminished.
Laws regulating permitted distance from schools are usually reserved for drug dispensaries, which are only restricted from a 600-foot radius, and sex offenders, who pose a direct threat to school children. The corresponding “threat” from food trucks, however, is much less obvious.
Not all food trucks are created equal. For example, Green Truck, which has stopped by USC, sells vegan burgers made with local, organic produce. Don Chow’s Tacos, a regular near University Avenue, serves up tofu tacos with fresh avocado and pico de gallo. The bill makes no exceptions for trucks that aim to make healthy food more accessible.
Moreover, even though most trucks sell foods with less-than-optimal levels of nutrition, the sale of unhealthy food has never been a crime.
McDonald’s has been in business for 57 years, and it has never been restricted to certain areas. There are McDonald’s, Burger Kings and In-N-Outs across the street from high schools all over Los Angeles. None of these are illegal, and conceivably, none of them should be.
So how is it fair to so severely cripple food truck mobility, which is the very aspect of the food truck business that allows it to be successful?
In focusing on food trucks, the bill has good intentions, but it goes farther than it should. It implies that the food trucks are targeting the children in a way that is somehow worse than the ways McDonald’s openly does so with its Happy Meals.
It is more likely that the food trucks, which do not have the economic weight of a McDonald’s or a Burger King or the luxury of being firmly attached to one location, are being bullied by this bill because they are the only targets that can realistically be taken on.
The bill is unjust and should be voted down accordingly. The food trucks have every right to sell their snacks wherever they see fit, as long as McDonald’s and Burger King are permitted to do the same.

British television of the past decade has produced some of the funniest, most inventive and most entertaining shows. Here is an overview of a few of the highlights from the current scene of British TV.
Black Mirror
Black Mirror, with every episode, creates a unique and often horrifying universe. The show is not unlike Rod Serling’s classic The Twilight Zone, in that it uses clever conceits and science fiction settings to critique the current climate of the world.

Show creator and primary writer Charlie Brooker has been involved in several of the funniest and most honest programs in recent years, most notably Nathan Barley, Dead Set and Screenwipe, as a writer and a presenter — but this is his finest work to date.
Black Mirror focuses on humanity’s recent obsession with and reliance on technology as the basis for its dark, paranoiac storylines, which are global and deeply intimate in scope.
The show’s most compelling characteristic is its uncompromising nature. It is unafraid of confronting the audience with surprising truths and political incorrectness. The writing is intelligent, imaginative and complex. Nothing is ever clear-cut or as it appears to be on the surface. The characters are multifaceted and innately decent and easily corruptible.
Black Mirror is easily the best new piece of television produced in the past year, British or otherwise.
Jesse Armstrong, who wrote the final and most personal episode of Black Mirror, also co-wrote another great new show from the last year with his long-term writing partner Sam Bain.
Fresh Meat
Fresh Meat is about a group of disparate college freshmen who are forced to live together. It focuses largely on the different façades that they put up in an attempt to reinvent themselves in their new surroundings. Over the course of their first semester of college and the first season of the series, each character changes in monumental ways, both good and bad.
The characters are relatable in their awkwardness and uncertainty about themselves, even the ones who initially appear to be self-assured or annoying jerks. It’s out of this that Fresh Meat’s humor is born, and this relatability is largely based on the fact that the writing and the acting are extremely natural and believable. It’s a show that’s required viewing for college students.
Luxury Comedy
Noel Fielding’s Luxury Comedy premiered in January and employs Fielding’s signature psychedelic, surreal style of comedy and music. This time, however, he follows a sketch show format as opposed to the more narrative structure of The Mighty Boosh, his project with longtime collaborator Julian Barratt.
The show starts out fairly hit-and-miss: Some sketches are brilliant and make sense within their own surreal logic, while others appear to be total nonsense.
The third episode, however, is where the show starts to hit its stride.
One of the best sketches involves a pompous and deeply British intellectual (Richard Ayoade) waxing critical on the state of art before blaming Ice Cream Eyes — a man with, yes, ice cream for eyes — for everything that is wrong in the art world. There’s also a sketch with Dondylion, a David Lee Roth-obsessed, delusional lion who is trapped in a zoo and going mad from isolation.
Luxury Comedy has to be one of the most visually arresting programs ever created. The universe that the show inhabits is a beautifully painted dreamscape, and Fielding uses his training as an artist to magnificent effect in the creation of imaginative costumes, set dressing and animated backdrops.
To top it all off, the music — written and performed by Loose Tapestries, a band consisting of Fielding and Serge Pizzorno of Kasabian — is also consistently amazing.
Grandma’s House
Grandma’s House, the first foray into scripted television for Simon Amstell, the former host of Never Mind the Buzzcocks and Pop World, is a sitcom that is alternately sweet and acerbic.
Written by Amstell and Dan Swimer, the show is largely based on Amstell’s own family and experiences. Many of the subjects he addresses in the first season are present in his stand-up DVD Do Nothing, but that does not detract from the charm or hilarity of the show.
Awkwardness is the focus of much of the show’s humor. The fictional Simon has a hard time relating to people in a genuine way without acting like a crazed TV presenter. It’s only when he’s with his family that he is able to be something somewhat like himself.
The structure of Grandma’s House is fascinating because all the action is constrained to the titular house of Simon’s fictional grandma; for that reason, the plot revolves around honest and funny familial interactions and histrionics. Conflicts arise when various family members disagree with Simon’s often misguided life decisions, or when he disagrees with theirs.
Season two is currently in production, despite the unfortunate death of the great Geoffrey Hutchings (Grandpa) in 2010.
Black Mirror was brilliant!

Anyone with a genuine passion for food keeps a list of dream restaurants. If you love food, New York’s Momofuku Ko, Berkeley’s Chez Panisse and Tennessee’s Blackberry Farm are all gastronomic temples to which you’ve probably longed to pilgrimage.
And if you’ve never heard of these restaurants, you will soon. That’s because these are three of the latest food institutions branding themselves outside of their kitchens. With products like cookbooks, baking mixes and jams, you can now indulge in parts of your fantasy meals at a significant fraction of the price.
Blackberry Farm is a rustic retreat in Tennessee’s Great Smoky Mountains where resort guests can spend their days fly-fishing or shooting game. Inside the celebrated restaurant, guests refuel on dishes made with ingredients straight from the property itself.
The Blackberry Farm Cookbook was released in 2009; now, it’s a cause célèbre in the food world. The restaurant’s success is a result of the fact that, in a gourmet landscape littered with faux-farm affectations, Blackberry Farm is the real deal. With that in mind, the Blackberry Farm product line was released in 2011.
Some of the restaurant’s products, such as pesto and peanut butter, are nothing you can’t get elsewhere at local markets and farm stands. Other products, however, are uniquely the brand’s own: A jar of pickled beets and strawberries is unusual and pairs well atop wild rice or a thick slice of toast.
The company’s smoked onion jam is also killer. Because eating it plain can cause a stomachache — trust me on that — try a spoonful as relish atop a bleu cheese burger. Then close your eyes and imagine eating that burger in the misty green fields of southeastern Tennessee.
Those that long to retreat to Blackberry Farm for some food-filled memories can momentarily tide over that desire with these two products.
Another sustainability-minded restaurant, Chez Panisse, is also in a unique branding position.
The Berkeley institution is widely credited with spearheading the local food movement. But a restaurant committed to its own gardens and farmers, and to its humble, neighborhood aesthetic, can’t create an honest brand selling commercialized food goods.
At least that’s how Alice Waters, the restaurant’s outspoken founder, must see it; you won’t find Chez Panisse-brand seafood rubs or jarred ramps on market shelves.
Still, in its 40 highly publicized years, Chez Panisse has released cookbooks, including one last August. More notably, Waters tends to invite admirers not into the food of Chez Panisse, but into its sensibility. Through her Edible Schoolyard Project, Waters has aimed to add sustainable, food-minded practices into elementary school curriculum.
Though ESP has 16-year-old roots in Berkeley, the organization is gaining the most traction now. In recent years, major cities such as New Orleans, New York and Los Angeles, have added affiliate schoolyards. And celebrity followers like Jake Gyllenhaal are helping to popularize the initiative: The actor was profiled alongside Waters in the February “tastemakers” issue of Bon Appétit.
As an exemplar of sustainable eating, Waters has created an admirable brand for herself.
But for those who make allowances in their idealistic pursuit of sustainable food — and I hold to it that these allowances are necessary — there are the baked pleasures of Momofuku Milk Bar.
Milk Bar is a sweets-focused extension of Chef David Chang’s Pan-Asian Momofuku empire. The bakery’s cookbook, Milk, was released last October, and it’s one, not so incidentally, that Waters recently panned: Milk Bar’s cookies and pies call for Ovaltine, Skippy peanut butter and Fruity Pebbles.
It’s also no coincidence that the cookbook’s release concurred with the release of Milk-branded baking mixes.
Now some of New York’s most sought-after treats can be enjoyed in any home kitchen. They are also, like all truly great new products, unlike anything else on the market: The “compost cookie mix” is a combination of butterscotch, oats, coffee, potato chips, pretzels and chocolate, for instance.
The food products from Milk Bar and Blackberry Farm are available exclusively through Williams-Sonoma and the brands’ websites.
On a smaller, but equally exciting scale, you can see the makings of brands in some L.A. restaurants.
Bottega Louie, of course, has its pastel-colored pastry boxes, a presentation not so different from a Tiffany’s box and a touch that’s all the more exciting for macaron lovers.
And Bäco Mercat, the latest addition to Spring Street’s growing number of veritably funky joints, bottles its own soda. Bäco Pop is a citrusy, gingery drink available for purchase at the hostess stand.
Though the concept of branding is nothing new, it’s always intriguing to watch a restaurant or chef test limits. Branded products can help you curb the nuisance of logistics — time, money, travel — and allow you to get a taste of a chef’s distinguished style in the comfort of your own kitchen.
Yet, some are still staunchly opposed to commercialization in the restaurant world.
To those people, you must try a compost cookie. All should be forgiven with that first bite.
 
Bernard Leed is a junior majoring in narrative studies. His column “Amuse-Bouche” runs Wednesdays.
I have shelves full of cookbooks and a few of them are cookbooks from restaurants. 9 times out of 10 they are pure style and no substance but there are a few that I have worn out. The Ottolenghi cookbook for example, their chocolate chip cupcakes with rum ganache topping is heavenly and the wagamma cookbook for the teriaki marinade.
I do like the idea of the compost cookie from your article, I will hunt it out!

Hip-hop artist Drake has taken his music career to superstar status faster than almost anyone has ever done before.
His second and most recent album Take Care debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling more than 600,000 copies during the first week of sales and avoiding the dreaded “sophomore slump.”
Mr. Graham · Drake showcased his talents, such as his charismatic stage presence and ability to connect with the crowd, at his Galen Center concert. Guest performers J. Cole and Meek Mill also joined in on the fun. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
The album has since surpassed one  million album sales, giving Drake his second platinum album and spawning five singles that have all charted in the top 25 of the Billboard Hot 100.
With this success, Drake could have easily scheduled his Club Paradise Tour to visit the largest arenas and stadiums throughout the country and made very good money doing so. He decided, however, that he wanted to perform at college campuses in smaller and much more intimate settings.
In an interview with MTV News, Drake mentioned why fighting to get the tour to hit college campuses was important to him.
“I want to make sure I go see these people that supported me from day one,” Drake said.
And when he came to USC to see the Galen Center’s sold-out audience of around 10,000, he gave fans a more than worthwhile show.
Though openers Chase N. Cashe, A$AP Rocky and Kendrick Lamar kept the crowd excited during the first hour of the concert, the anticipation for Drake could be felt throughout the Galen Center once the opening acts were finished. When the lights dimmed, the crowd released that anticipation into a large and constant roar that lasted throughout his first medley of songs, which included the thematic “I’m On One.”
After getting some help from the crowd to sing “Crew Love,” Drake showed off his surprisingly adequate singing ability for the first time of the night in the song “Shot for Me.” Though Drake’s vocals definitely are not going to make him a Rhythm & Blues star anytime soon, they suit his performance style well. Accordingly, his signature ad-libs of “ohs” at the end of his notes had girls from the floor to the upper level screaming at the top of their lungs.
With the show in Los Angeles, it seemed nearly certain that Drake would have some surprise guest or guests in store for the evening.
Sure enough, he brought out Bay Area-rapper LoveRance to perform his song “Up!” followed by Maybach Music Group member Meek Mill, who energized the crowd even more with his pumped- up performances of “House Party” and “Ima Boss.” Drake followed, ending the first half of his set with a strong rendition of “Forever” before going offstage for a short interlude.
Returning to sing his drunken ballad “Marvin’s Room,” he was almost overpowered by the crowd’s participation. He continued with an extremely energetic performance of “Take Care,” in which he completely immersed himself in the music and danced all over the stage during the last minutes of the song.
The highlight of the night, however, goes to the  unexpected appearance of RocNation’s own J. Cole for a surprise performance of his hit song “Can’t Get Enough.” The audience’s shock was noticeable throughout the song.
Before going into the final songs of his show, Drake went section by section through the crowd for about 10 minutes, pointing out the most noticeable fans he could find.
From a girl with a mustard yellow shirt in the upper level to a serious-looking man wearing sunglasses to a woman with a poster about traveling 1,403 miles to see the performance, he pointed out as many people as he could for whatever reason he could think of — mostly to reciprocate the love his fans were giving him.
After performing his last two songs, “The Motto” and “Headlines,” Drake again took the time to sincerely thank everyone for coming to the show and supporting his music. He mentioned that even though the rap game is always changing, he will continue to make music for his fans until his body is in the dirt. Drake ended the show with an assertive “Take care!”
Drake’s Club Paradise Tour was a perfect show of everything Drake offers as an artist.
His ability to slow down and sing a couple of songs without losing the energy of the crowd is a testament to his organization of the show. Not to mention, his utilization of both a full band and DJ throughout the show — in addition to the attention-grabbing light shows — gave the show much more of a live and musical experience.
For Drake, there was no better way to showcase his artistry.

It was a busy weekend for the USC track and field team as they competed in two meets.
On Friday, the women’s team travelled to Fayetteville, Arkansas to compete in the NCAA Last Chance Qualifier, the last opportunity for these athletes to qualify for the NCAA Indoor Track Championships
The Women of Troy walked away with a team win in addition to an individual placement. The Women’s 4×400 meter relay team, consisting of freshmen Vanessa Jones and Akawkaw Ndipagbor, sophomore Jenna Puterbaugh and senior Dalilah Muhammad, placed first in their event with a time of 3:37.57. Senior Dalilah Muhammad, co-captain of the women’s track and field squad would also place third in the women’s 60m Hurdle preliminaries; going on to finish third in the 60m Hurdle finals with a time of 8.31 seconds.
On Saturday, both the men’s and women’s track and field teams competed at the Beach Classic. The event, hosted by Long Beach State at Cerritos College in Norwalk, was an outdoor meet between USC and several Division II schools. The Trojans teams left the meet with several wins to add to their record; three wins for the men’s team and five for the women’s team.
The men’s team won two track events as well as finishing first in triple jump. Senior Joey Hughes, co-captain of the men’s team, captured first place in the 200m race, posting a time of 21.43. Sophomore Josh Mance finished in a close second in the same event, clocking in at 21.49.
Bryshon Nellum finished first in the men’s 400m race, posting a final time of 46.87. Senior Tony Burnett earned the team’s final win, jumping a season-best mark of 49-6.25 to finish first in the men’s triple jump.
The women’s team walked away from the Beach Classic with five wins. Sophomore Loudia Laarman won the women’s 200m dash, posting a time of 24.58, while freshman Erica Capellino won the 1500m with a time of 4:40.72.
Redshirt senior and co-captain Marissa Minderler finished first in two separate individual events: hammer throw (202-5) and shot put (47-0.25). In addition, the women’s hammer team took the first five places — a feat the team also achieved during last week’s meet.
To add a final win for the Trojans, the women’s 4x400m relay team (consisting of freshman Melia Cox, sophomores Jessica Davis, Loudia Laarman, and senior Anniya Louis) posted a time of 3:52.68 to win their event.

In a battle of two top teams, USC’s second-ranked women’s tennis team lost a 4-3 heartbreaker to No. 1 UCLA (12-0) Thursday afternoon before besting the University of San Diego on Saturday 6-1.
After opening Pac-12 play with a decisive victory over No. 5 Cal, the Women of Troy (10-2) were poised to challenge the Bruins for the top spot in the conference. Coach Richard Gallien’s group was also looking to exact some revenge against UCLA after they bounced USC in the semifinals of the ITA National Indoor Championships just three weeks prior.
Despite their success in recent weeks, the Women of Troy had failed to win the doubles’ point in three out of their last four matches and Thursday would be no exception.
Although the pairing of junior Danielle Lao and senior Alison Ramos were able to register the first victory of the match on court two against Montez/Vannguye 8-2, the third-ranked duo of sophomore Kaitlyn Christian and freshman Sabrina Santamaria against UCLA’s top team of Anderson/Dolehide.
In the point-deciding game on court three, freshman Zoe Scandalis and junior Valeria Pulido, who rank 39th in the country, couldn’t hold on to their 6-5 lead and fell to the UCLA tandem of Jones and Seguso 8-6.
While the momentum had been shifted over to the Bruins side, USC quickly regained it behind a strong home crowd with Christian taking down UCLA’s Skylar Morton and the 26th-ranked Santamaria bullying Pamela Montez to even the match at 2-2. In between the two victories for USC, Scandalis had her hands full all day trying to keep up with No. 5 Robin Anderson on court one and the battle of the freshman went to the Bruins as Anderson would record a 6-3, 6-3 win.
After Lao dismantled Jones on court two and Ramos fell on court six, the match stood at 3-3 and would once again come down to freshman Gabriella DeSimone. Though the season is still young, DeSimone has already shown a propensity to play well under pressure as evidenced by two game-clinching wins in USC’s last three victories, including last weekend against Cal.
The magic would run out for the freshman this Thursday, however, as she could not take advantage of a first set victory. Despite being down a set, UCLA’s freshman Channelle Van Nguyen came out strong in the next two sets and quelled any comeback DeSimone tried to put together, taking the match 4-6, 6-2 6-3.
Still dealing with the heartbreak of Thursday’s loss, Saturday would elicit a much better outcome for the Women of Troy.
In need of a rebound game, USC was all over the San Diego from the start, taking the doubles point with a 2-1 victory. Coach Gallien tweaked the doubles’ lineup against USD moving Sabrina Santamaria with Lao and pairing Santamaria’s previous partner Kaitlyn Christian with the junior Pulido.
In singles, the Women of Troy would’ve completed the sweep if Sabrina Santamria had not retired due to injury early in the second set.
While this week’s slew of games may be seen as a disappointment, the young Women of Troy can take pride in the fight and grit they showed battling the nation’s best team. With much of Pac-12 play still ahead of them, USC will get another crack at the Bruins and a chance to take down their top-ranked rivals.

With Love at the Bottom of the Sea, released just last week, the Magnetic Fields have returned to that simplistic synth rock aesthetic that first popularized Stephen Merritt and his troupe of musical madmen back in the nineties. After the ‘no-synth trilogy’ which consisted of i (2004), Distortion (2008) and Realism (2010), this is a return to the Golden Age of the Fields, i.e., to When Stephen Merritt Became a Hipster God, i.e., to that magical time during which 69 Love Songs (1999) came out.
To celebrate, let’s look briefly back at a few of the songs from 69 Love Songs.
Absolutely Cuckoo
This song, the album’s opener, tells us exactly what we are getting into. Clocking in at barely a minute and a half, it does not intimidate; it is damn funny; and, with a simple melody repeatedly repeated, it utterly lacks pretension. Plus, anybody who has been in love can empathize with the narrator’s disclaimed obsessive craziness.
Let’s Pretend We’re Bunny Rabbits
Merritt has said: “69 Love Songs is not remotely an album about love. It’s an album about love songs.” And knowing this, we might think of “Let’s Pretend We’re Bunny Rabbits” as a clever commentary on the music scene, its commentary being that love songs are veiled aphrodisiacs. Or, we can listen to it as a funny song about having lots and lots of sex.
The One You Really Love 
69 Love Songs isn’t all fun and games. In this song, Stephen Merritt shows off his versatility: He oscillates here (from the caustic silliness of “How Fucking Romantic”) to heartbreaking heartbreak, to a desperate painful feeling surely commonplace among people in love: You love somebody more than you love me.
Asleep and Dreaming 
A little known fact about this song: Lemony Snicket, the acclaimed and mega-popular novelist who wrote the acclaimed and mega-popular A Series of Unfortunate Events books, both arranged this song and played accordion on this song’s final, recorded version. A more commonly known fact about this song: This song is stupendously gorgeous.
Underwear
This song is silly and it is about underwear.
Yeah! Oh, Yeah!
This song (the first Magnetic Fields song I ever listened to) fully displays Stephen Merritt’s gleeful contempt for love song clichés (and is a really good Magnetic Fields induction song). Here is the setup: A husband and his wife are singing to each other about the state of their marriage and when she asks him shocked unhappy questions—e.g., “Do you want to break my heart?”—he happily replies, “Yeah! Oh, yeah!”
Zebra 
“Zebra” is the perfect finale for 69 Love Songs because its story, in which a woman asks her lover to buy increasingly preposterous gifts, utterly captures the process of contemporary romance. We are always looking for satisfaction. We look continuously for true love and happiness, and then for truer love and happier happiness, and the grass never quite becomes green enough. Finally, this album about love songs reminds us why we listen to love songs. Through music, we yearn for more.
