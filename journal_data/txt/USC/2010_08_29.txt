After two years of heavy contsruction behind cardinal and gold veiled fences, the eagerly awaited Ronald Tutor Campus Center opened its doors to the public this summer.  Though it has been open in some capacity since the beginning of August, the majority of the student body got its first taste of the new digs on the first week of classes.  With the passing of the dedication ceremony and the fanfare of the weeklong opening celebration winding down to a close, we want to know:
What are your initial impressions of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center?
I cannot believe that I am the only person who is disgusted by this building. It is a piece of architectural pornography, in the style of a trashy Greco-Roman Las Vegas hotel.  Is that spray-painted styrofoam?  
And when you throw in all of the questionable dealings that went into funding/constructing it…. sickening.  I feel absolutely ill every single time I see it.
It’s confusing to access, also it is overcrowded with tables and chairs. It seems fancy and nice though, once I know how to get in. I like Seeds marketplace but I wish the windows looked onto something better than the kitchen. I wish they had a salad bar. Also I wish there were different restaurants.
It’s very pretty, but certainly crowded and will probably remain that way. I agree that having the Lot open (even with 1 or 2 restaurants) would really ease those crowds at mealtimes. Also the entrances are very clogged and the poles/tables don’t help that! I wish there were a map of the place because it’s big enough to get lost in there.
Overall, I believe USC Admin should decrease the student body population, both undergraduate and graduate. 
The building is beautiful and I love studying there. I am so proud to be a Trojan.
The food court is far too crowded. If the lot was still open, then maybe there would be enough restaurants on campus to satisfy student and faculty demand. I for one don’t have time to wait in line for 30 minutes to get lunch.

Unless you’re still living with your parents, chances are that you’re either sharing a small kitchen with several other housemates or you’re stuck in a dorm without a kitchen where you barely have room to store a Heinz squeeze bottle.
Therefore, you might not find it wise to purchase more last-minute items, but you might still want to consider the following three items that will not only make your life easier but tastier, too.
1) Folding shopping carts:
Stop smirking. Yes, the very fact that they’re nicknamed “granny” carts brings to mind the image of a toothless senior citizen hobbling behind a creaky cart with a bag of cat litter in tow. I don’t care if you’re 6 feet tall and 190 pounds of pure muscle; when you’re chasing rolling balls of fruit across the streets, ripped bag in hand, you won’t think these carts are so ridiculous.
Whether you’re making a trip to Ralphs, the farmers market, the bookstore or the liquor store, you’ll have to haul home a heavy load. Unless you own a car, having a shopping cart on hand will be a huge relief. No longer do you have to make multiple trips to the store. Now you can buy that more economical 12-pack of Dr. Pepper without turning the return trip into a whole-body workout session. You might even save a few bucks since you no longer have to bribe a friend to act as your chauffeur.
Invest in a good, quality cart. You don’t have to spend a lot: A durable cart of decent size can cost about $20-$30 and is available at places such as Target, Walmart and the Dollar Store at the University Village.
Another good quality of this cart is that it takes up minimal space. When not in use, you can just fold it up and tuck it in a corner. Make sure to find one with turning front wheels, however, or navigating the cart will be stiff and difficult.
2) Slow-cooker:
The slow-cooker is hugely underrated. It really should be the godfather of all cooking appliances, because there is practically nothing it can’t do. It’s not just good for pot roasts and stews in cold weather — it is also useful for condiments, breads, pasta, grains and even desserts in summer, when it is simply too hot to turn on the oven.
You can save time and energy with a slow-cooker. You don’t need to get a fancy-schmancy gadget — a basic cooker with simple settings will cost anywhere between $20-$50, depending on the size and the brand. Get a 3.5-quart cooker if you want individual portions and dislike leftovers, or one of six to seven quarts if you want to make friends by feeding them.
After spending that small amount, you’ll be paid back over time with lower energy bills. Operating a slow-cooker costs about two cents per hour, compared to a conventional electric oven, which costs nearly 20 cents per hour.
Another way slow-cookers save money is that you can nix fattier, pricier portions of meat like rib eye, because the slow cooking tenderizes tougher, leaner cuts of meat (like the heart, if you dare). That also means you get a much healthier dish without sacrificing flavor.
You don’t need to be Alton Brown or Albert Einstein to use a slow-cooker. It’s as simple as dumping a piece of meat and a bottle of your favorite sauce into the pot and turning the dial to low for the whole day. Wash some potatoes, pop them into the cooker and cook on high for a few hours for baked potatoes.
For those adventurous foodies who like to play with their food, slow-cookers are extremely versatile and open to all sorts of experiments. Check out the blog “A Year of Slow Cooking” for a selection of mind-blowing recipes, from chai tea lattes to peanut butter brownies to pumpkin pudding.
If you’re getting into a more serious relationship with your slow cooker, you might even want to purchase a slow-cooker cookbook. Leaf through The Best Slow Cooker Cook Book Ever: More Than 400 Easy-to-Make Recipes by Diane Phillips, which showcases all sorts of creative yet simple recipes using easy-to-find ingredients and minimal techniques.
But the best thing about slow-cookers? The wonderful, heart-warming aroma wafting from the kitchen as you step into the house after a long day at school. It’s almost like being back home again, greeted by Mom’s lovingly prepared home-cooked meal.
3) Indoor mini grill:
We’ve all seen those George Foreman commercials. Whether you find him annoying or entertaining, George is a godsend when it comes to producing fast and healthy meals and snacks, especially on lazy days in which you just don’t want to fuss around the stove.
For less than $20, you can find a Lean Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machine Champ Grill (really, that’s what it’s called) at Walmart or online at Amazon.com. It doesn’t take too much space and will do the job.
Because it heats up on both the top and bottom sides, the food cooks up fast and evenly, and you don’t have to fuss around trying to flip the food, which helps retain moisture.
Anything is game here — burgers, bacon, chicken breasts, steaks, fish, sandwiches, vegetables, fruits — just use your imagination. It’s amazing what a grill can do to resuscitate “bad” foods: Bruised peaches, when grilled, turn into juicy, fragrant sweet jewels that can be tossed with salads or stuffed into grilled cheese sandwiches. Or butter a stale piece of bread, rub some fresh garlic cloves over and transform it into a crunchy, chewy and flavorful accompaniment to your reheated canned soup
Just like regular grills, this mini version also leaves signature grill marks on the surface, which adds a certain level of attraction and rustic quality to a simple meal. This quality comes in handy when you’ve got a cute date to impress but terrible cooking skills.
If you’ve been convinced, head on out; you’ve got some shopping to do. It’s time to make some sacrifices. If there simply isn’t enough space in your kitchen, ponder “What would A foodie do?” and clear up some room in your closet to make way for these essential items. Your 13 pairs of skinny jeans won’t feed you, but these will.
Sophia Lee is a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. Her column, “That’s What She Ate,” runs Mondays.
Back when hubby and I were in university and had long labs till late in the evenings, the slow cooker was our best friend. I’d throw in stuff to make soup or a whole meal for dinner in the mornings, and when we got home, everything was ready. Best thing we ever bought back in our school days!
“Your 13 pairs of skinny jeans won’t feed you, but these will.”…girl after my own heart.
Unfortunately, I can’t have any of these where I live. I was allowed more appliances in my high school dorm than in college.
In grad. school, I will definitely be getting a slow cooker, however. I love to put food into the slow cooker and smell it as it cooks away all day.
The most important cooking item I bring (besides a fridge) is my electric kettle. I drink about 6 cups a day…probably more!

Vampires. Mummies. Creatures from the black lagoon. Hulking inventions of science. Zombies. Monsters.
Some stem from timeless legends and others come from recent works of fiction, but the fact is that monsters are archetypes and the pillar of the horror genre. Although certain trends have come and gone — serial killers and the Saw-style torture films among them — monsters have remained prevalent even in the modern era.
Long-running franchises still offer new tales of classic characters and modern stories add fresh takes on old concepts, for better or for worse. 2010 saw the release of both a remake of The Wolfman, a monster classic, and a new Twilight film. As the year draws to a close, the television adaptation of Robert Kirkman’s zombie apocalypse comic The Walking Dead is set to debut on AMC.
So for all of their mileage, what is it about monsters that make them so endearing to horror fiction fans?
Monsters thrive as a topic in fiction because, like all good fantasy, they are used as a way to explore human nature. By setting the conflict in the context of the supernatural, monster stories give writers a way to analyze humanity in ways that are not available in conventional fiction.
A good horror story offers not just suspense, but also a look into the inner workings of man.
Classic monster stories embraced this idea. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein: Or, the Modern Prometheus, was not just about Victor Frankenstein creating his monster. The story touched on the growing Industrial Revolution and themes such as the relation of science to society, as well as the idea of “playing God.”
Bram Stoker’s Dracula is another example. Although it is on one level a book about people fighting an Eastern European vampire, Stoker’s novel carries many levels of meaning and philosophy. It explores Victorian sexuality and mores. Dracula was a force of nature, a walking taboo. By confronting the women of the story, Stoker was forcing readers to confront sex and desire in Victorian society.
Ultimately, it is a book on modern culture versus tradition. Jonathan Harker and Abraham Van Helsing are able to defeat the Count, through their use of modern technology and science. Dracula tries these methods, but falls back on his supernatural abilities, which only leads to his demise.
In the early 20th century, as cinema developed, filmmakers looked for stories that would not only get audiences into the theater, but also make the new medium memorable. They chose monster fiction. With Universal Studios leading the movement, classic monster myths and novels came to the silver screen. Beginning with Dracula and Frankenstein in 1931, Universal created more than a decade of high-profile monster movies; collectively, the characters are known as the “Universal Monsters.”
Even with the changes Hollywood made to the source material, these films took the time to add a level of introspection beyond the frights. The Frankensteins of Universal were a family perpetually haunted by their past actions, stuck in a vicious cycle of violence because of the inhuman creature.
In The Wolfman, a new story based on old legends, the filmmakers contrasted the old world and tradition with the United States and modernity, all while offering an examination of a father’s relationship with his son.
However, in recent decades, the point of monster fiction has slowly become obscured. Monsters are no longer a tool to explore the human psyche. Now, they are nothing more than a gimmick, brought out to add some color to generic stories or add a bit of gore to a film.
In a way, it follows the decline in suspense in horror fiction. Who wants to wait in terror for what could be around the corner when the surprise can be seen right away?
Nowhere is this more evident than vampire fiction. The once-terrorizing monsters — creatures that have haunted humanity in legend for centuries — are polarized to the extreme. They are either mindless, virus-driven beasts, as with the comics and film 30 Days of Night, or they’re overly sentimental beings caught up in love triangles, a move started by Anne Rice and codified by Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight series.
Yet the reason monsters remain popular,is that, at their best, monster stories say something about humankind. There is a purpose to the genre, one that should be rediscovered if monsters are to stay relevant.
And maybe it has. 2010’s remake of The Wolfman offered a classic horror tale, and improved on the original’s clash of cultures. The Walking Dead, an award-winning comic and soon-to-be television series, uses the zombie apocalypse of its setting to explore how survivors would react in the situation. The story is not fighting the undead, but trying to stay sane in a world of perpetual struggle.
Monsters thrive because they offer more than just a fright. They last not because they’re a gimmick, but because they say something about the world around them. Isn’t that what a good story should do?

“We have a team of 99 percent of guys right now who are fully committed to being a championship student-athlete on the field and off the field,” Kiffin said. “We didn’t feel like Patrick was doing that.”
Hall, a four-star recruit two years ago out of Oxnard, Calif., did not play last season while dealing with injuries and academic issues. He also sat out drills last spring rehabbing an injured knee.
According to Kiffin, the suspension resulted from a lack of focus and not an isolated incident. Kiffin reached his decision after sitting down with Hall and feeling like he had different goals than the rest of the team.
“This is not something you’re going to find he did something really wrong over the last week or anything [with] the law,” he said.
Kiffin added that Hall had a chance to rejoin the team once he changes his focus.
The suspension leaves USC with just 70 scholarship players two days before they leave for its season opener against Hawai’i. NCAA regulations allow up to 85 scholarship athletes.

Three days from now, the young, talented and completely unproven USC football team will take the field in Honolulu, Hawaii for its first game since the purging that took place earlier this year, which removed coaches, athletic directors and any chance of a BCS bowl (or any bowl, for that matter) appearance.
Only a select few — the enthusiastic recruits, the loyal veterans, the effective assistants — remained to follow coach Lane Kiffin toward a new and promising future as the dirty days of old were washed clean.
With a new face given to USC football, the only thing left for the team to do was move on and grow back into the dynamic, successful football machine that once existed at this university.
But then they ran into a slight problem.
Maturing requires experience, and experience requires time — of which USC has none. Without live tackling in practice, scrimmages at game-speed or a corps of leaders to, well, lead, the Trojans — and Kiffin, who has a mere 12-21 record as head coach — are essentially without a clue as to how they will achieve success this season. And unfortunately, they don’t have any more practice time to figure that out.
But there is a silver lining in every cloud, and this time it can be found in the one place the Trojans have no control over: their schedule.
Gone are the second-week Ohio State games in Columbus, Ohio, the ear-ringing trips to Seattle, Wash., and the death marches to Eugene, Ore., on Halloween night.
In their place sits something much more inviting: a golden month of games to start the season, pitting the Trojans against Hawai’i, Virginia, Minnesota and Washington State teams that finished a combined 16-34 last season, followed by a smattering of critical matchups at home in the Coliseum.
Only one of those first four teams — Minnesota — went to a bowl game last year, and none of them finished in the top half of their respective conferences. Virginia hasn’t won more than five games in three of the past four seasons, and Hawai’i has only had glimpses of success since its undefeated run in 2007 ended with a 41-10 drubbing at the hands of Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. And because I am a fan of brevity, I will refrain from elaborating on Washington State’s laundry list of underachievements over the past decade.
Though I will be the first person to say that the worst thing the Trojans can do this season is not take these first four opponents seriously, I think we can all agree that USC’s opening month of games is not what it was last year, or the year before that (or even the year before that).
This provides the Trojans with some room to grow and some experience to build on — two things they are desperately in need of. They have the opportunity to try new things, to see which players work where and to get a general sense of how this new team will react to in-game situations — all without risking too much in the win-loss column.
It also helps that, after these first four games, the Trojans will play four of their next five games in the Coliseum, where 90,000 screaming supporters make it obvious that home-field advantage still exists. Even the apprehension of the lone road game at Stanford during this stretch will be quelled, as the bevy of Trojan fans making their annual weekender pilgrimage to Northern California will provide additional support for USC.
If Kiffin can play his cards right, the rebuilding year that every critic of Trojan football expected in the wake of the NCAA sanctions might not be necessary.
And if the Trojans can use the beginning of the season as a learning period, it should put them in a position to take on the meat of their schedule — starting with Washington at home, exactly one month after the Hawai’i game.
One month; not much time, but time nonetheless. And for USC’s young-but-hungry squad, this could be all the time it needs.

The USC women’s volleyball team proved to be nearly unbeatable at home over the weekend, defeating all three teams it faced en route to winning the 2010 Luxe City Center Trojan Invitational.
Sky high · Junior setter Kendall Bateman was named Most Valuable Player for the 2010 Luxe City Center Trojan Invitational, which USC won. - Daily Trojan File Photo 
The Women of Troy lost only one set during the matches, as they swept Loyola Marymount Friday night 3-0 before rolling to 3-0 and 3-1 wins Saturday against Bucknell and Cal State Fullerton, respectively.
The most suspenseful match came Saturday night against Cal State Fullerton. The Women of Troy dropped the first set 25-22, forcing the team to overcome a deficit for the first time this season.
USC then pulled out to a 23-19 lead in the second set before four unanswered points by Cal State Fullerton pushed the score to a 23-23 tie. But a game-winning kill delivered by freshman outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana allowed USC to prevail in the end, 26-24.
Riding their momentum from the second set win, the Women of Troy did not look back, winning the third set 25-18 and clinching the match and tournament title in the fourth set, 25-19.
“After losing the first game, I didn’t know how we’d handle that,” said USC coach Mick Haley. “I thought we battled really well.”
Overall, the primetime battle featured a number of long rallies and exceptional diving plays by freshman libero Natalie Hagglund that had the crowd applauding. Junior setter Kendall Bateman proved to be a catalyst for USC’s success as well, recording a career high 66 assists and 18 digs in the final match.
After the match, when asked what he was most proud of regarding his team’s comeback, Haley was unable to identify a single factor.
“They didn’t doubt themselves,” Haley said. “They picked each other up. They rooted for each other when they came out to rest.”
Saturday morning’s match against Bucknell lacked the intensity of the final, but was successful for the Women of Troy nonetheless. USC dominated the first set with a convincing 25-7 victory, and followed with 25-18 and 25-13 wins in the second and third sets to clinch the match.
On Friday against Loyola Marymount, USC once again started strong, winning the first set 25-12 and the second 25-18. In the third set, Haley took the opportunity to insert more freshmen into the lineup; and although the score was tighter at 25-19, USC again managed to finish on top.
“I think whenever you do get to the third set you have to remember to always finish and the game’s never over,” Bateman said. “We’ll just have to work on that and keep our focus until the end of the match.”
Friday’s victory was literally one for the books, as it marked Haley’s 1,000th victory in collegiate women’s volleyball. Despite the impressive milestone, he said he had not thought much about the numbers and did not attribute the victories to his coaching ability.
“I don’t even know what it means to win 1,000,” Haley said. “You know, it just means that I’ve had awfully good players and been at awfully good schools, and for that, I’m extremely appreciative.”
Although Haley chose to remain humble, his players could not resist the opportunity to praise him.
“He’s done amazing things, and it’s just great to be here playing under him because you know he’s one of the best coaches in the nation, if not the best coach,” Hagglund said.
Not only was Friday’s match a historic one for Haley; it was also the first collegiate game for the team’s six active freshmen. And though their play was highlighted, the nerves were present as well.
“I was freaking out at first,” Hagglund said. “My hands were shaking every time I passed the ball.”
Haley utilized his team’s youth and depth throughout the entire tournament — he used 14 players and repeatedly made rotation changes. In Saturday morning’s match against Bucknell, he sat junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter and junior middle blocker Lauren Williams until the third set.
“So far, everybody’s just worked so hard that everybody deserved a chance to show me and show everybody else what they can do,” Haley said.
Jupiter and Williams were both named to the All-Tournament team, and Bateman was honored with the tournament’s Most Valuable Player award.
USC will next face action in a three-day tournament in Hawaii starting Friday. The Women of Troy will get a chance at a rematch against No. 5 Hawai’i, which ended USC’s run in the second round of the NCAA tournament at the Galen Center last year.

An academic reviewing website, MyEdu, now grants USC students access to its online database that provides users with course reviews, professor ratings, degree requirements and general school information.
Before this semester, MyEdu charged students a fee for its various services, but now offers free access.
“[We] enable the students to provide the information based on experience. Any official information we obtain is accessible to the public, but we focus on making it available in one easy-to-use website,” Kathryn Walker, a public relations associate for MyEdu, wrote in an e-mail.
However, because USC is a private university, MyEdu is not able to obtain access to official grade records of the offered classes. MyEdu granted USC students access to its services independent of USC.
“We do not work with USC administrators or faculty/staff but rather enable the students to provide the information based on experience. Any official information we obtain is accessible to the public, but we focus on making it available in one easy-to-use website,” Walker wrote.
Walker said she believes that the site is able to provide the essential information, regardless.
“I think it’s great that this has become openly available to USC students. I know so many people who rearrange their schedule once the semester starts because a class either didn’t live up to their expectations or they didn’t like the way the professor taught them,” said Julia Raynsford, a junior majoring in political science.
About two years ago, the Undergraduate Student Government launched a new course guide based on student responses. In addition, the university provides student feedback online based on class evaluation forms given at the end of every course, but not all students find those services sufficient.
“I wish USC had started using a program like [MyEdu] a long time ago,” said Natalie Mahdavi, a senior majoring in communication. “It definitely could have helped me pick out not only classes for my major but interesting electives as well.”
MyEdu is also expanding into the social media world, working with Facebook to enhance  services to students. One such service is MyEdu’s new version of its Facebook application called “Schedule Planner,” which allows students to see what classes their friends are taking as well as post their own schedule.
“Our new and improved schedule planner … also includes a ‘magic schedule maker’ that automatically plans classes based on courses a student inputs into their degree timeline,” Walker wrote.
MyEdu was founded 10 years ago by three people looking to improve the way  students register for classes at Texas A&M University. Chris Chilek, John Cunningham and Michael Crosno created the website specifically to access professors’ grade histories to give them a better idea of what courses would be a good choice for them.
The website quickly spread throughout the university, with more than 800 users in the first two months alone. It then expanded throughout various universities in Texas and is now being used by more than 750 universities and colleges nationwide, making it the largest database of academic information in the United States.
“About two years ago, we found that there was a lot more we could do to help students than just find professors,” Chilek said.

The Ronald Tutor Campus Center is not only the newest building on USC’s campus, but also the greenest.
Lasting impact · The campus center is LEED-certified for its sustainable features, including ventilation, long-life lightbulbs, use of natural lighting and toxic-free paints. - Ted Gerike | Daily Trojan 
For the first time at USC, a building received a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certificate.
“We spend 90 percent of our time in buildings,” said Lance Williams, Ph.D., former USC professor and current executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the Green Building Council, the national organization that distributes the award. “The way to regulate the amount of energy and harmful impact of greenhouse gases is by starting with buildings.”
An average LEED-certified building saves 30 to 40 percent on energy use and creates 70 percent less solid waste, according to Williams.
The campus center is about 30 percent more energy efficient than the standards demanded by the state, said Stan Westfall, project manager for the campus center.
Administrators decided they wanted the campus center to be LEED certified before a shovel had even touched dirt.
“[It was] way before we were doing blueprints, before the initial documents,” Westfall said.
Westfall said he believes integrating LEED-certifiable features into the campus center was easier because of early planning by the administration and construction company.
At about $2,000, a LEED certification is no small cost, but the designation brings green credibility, Williams said.
Three levels of certificate — silver, gold and platinum — are given based on performance in a variety of categories, including water efficiency and indoor environmental quality. USC’s building received a silver designation.
“We were able to pay special attention when we did some early demolition to recycle a large percentage,” Westfall said. “We also bought a lot of materials locally.”
Water preservation was also a key factor for the certification. At night and in off-hours a water reservoir found below Cromwell Field filters and transports water to the campus center.
But some students don’t think the building seems any greener than others on campus.
“It’s hard to say,” said Lucas Boyd, a senior majoring in political science. “I haven’t seen anything that indicates it’s sustainable.”
Although key aspects to the building’s award were its use of natural light, good ventilation and use of non-toxic paint, most of the LEED implementations aren’t noticeable. Low-flow plumbing, trash compactors that separate out biodegradables and lighting with long-life bulbs are a few of the many examples.
Not every environmental application in the building might be visible to the untrained eye, but Williams said the impact a LEED building makes on the world is what’s truly important.
“It is essentially a recognition that the earth’s resources are finite,” he said. “So many people are concerned from a scientific as well as business and social perspective as to how to preserve and protect as many of the earth’s resources as possible.”
Williams said he hopes LEED certifications at USC will only increase in years to come.
“[A green environment] is a critical part of our world — it’s not an adjunct or a fad or something going away. It is a measure that has to continue to be promoted,” he said.

Wireless Internet at the University Park Campus and the Health Sciences Campus is being upgraded and should already be providing a stronger, more reliable connection in some locations, according to Information Technology Services officials.
ITS, which first announced its wireless initiative in April, began working with the Undergraduate Student Government and the Strategic Technology Forum over the summer to understand student concerns about wireless  Internet on campus and to search for the best solution, said Kevin Durkin, director of communications and marketing for ITS.
“We heard loud and clear that the No. 1 interest for most people is to have better wireless,” Durkin said. “That will definitely happen with this [initiative].”
ITS and USG have not had a close relationship in the past, said Chris Cheng, USG president, but after hearing many students express the need for better wireless Internet on campus during his presidential campaign, Cheng immediately planned meetings with ITS after the election.
“We want to make wireless ubiquitous across campus,” Cheng said. “[ITS is] very supportive of the student government and we can appreciate that a lot. It’s been going extremely well.”
The increased use of mobile devices has forced ITS to look at newer technology to accommodate for laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access wireless Internet on the USC campuses, Durkin said.
“What really drove this frankly was really student use and faculty use,” Durkin said. “Most, if not all users, rely more on the wireless network [than Ethernet].”
ITS and the Strategic Technology Forum, an advisory board of IT leaders across campus, chose a new wireless infrastructure at the beginning of summer with plans to double the number of university access points by the end of the calendar year. The old equipment supported 1,578 access points, and the new infrastructure will replace those existing access points and install more.
“This new equipment is really a leap from our old equipment,” Durkin said. “All 3,500 new access points are much better than the previous kind.”
More than 35,000 devices have already used the new access points that have been installed. ITS does not yet have an exact number of how many new access points have been installed, Durkin said, but work is still ongoing.
“They’re actually trying to hit the more heavily used areas first,” he said. “The work is moving along at a clip.”
Some students on campus have already noticed a difference in the strength of the wireless.
“The connection is definitely stronger. I have more bars for the signal,” said Brittany Younger, a senior majoring in psychology.
Yet, some spots on campus can still be troubling for students to find a strong wireless connection.
“I just kind of move if it’s not working,” said Lillian Ware, a senior majoring in environmental engineering. “I think it’s great that they’re trying to make it better.”
Students should begin to notice a difference more as the semester goes on, Durkin said. Birnkrant Residential College, for example, is the first dorm on campus to be fully rewired.
“You should never really notice anything less than what you had before,” said Durkin who confirmed that students will never be without wireless as new access points and wiring are installed. “We are swapping out the old and putting in the new … it’s a seamless thing.”

Upset by the University of San Diego in its season opener, the USC women’s soccer team was able to rebound last weekend to earn a 1-0 road victory against the TCU Horned Frogs (1-2-0) and a hard-fought 1-1 tie against the Texas Longhorns (2-0-1). Improving to 1-1-1 on the season, the Women of Troy relied on the heroics of Ashli Sandoval, who scored both goals this weekend.
Sudden impact · Redshirt junior midfielder Ashli Sandoval — pictured here in 2008 — capped off her first games back for USC since an ACL tear with back-to-back goals. - Daily Trojan file photo 
After an arduous year of rehabbing her knee, Sandoval checked in at the 32nd minute of the TCU game, making her season debut. Sparing no time to assert herself, she quickly authored two scoring chances before finally capitalizing in the 40th minute on a shot taken 25 yards from goal. Ricocheting off a lunging defender, the ball changed direction too sharply for TCU goaltender Kelsey Walters to readjust before it found the back of the net.
Not to be overshadowed by the headlining return of Sandoval, the many freshmen who are being indoctrinated by fire this season played strong games. Aided by fellow freshmen defenders Mia Bruno and Allie Harrison, Shelby Church made six saves to record the first shutout of her career. In addition, freshman midfielder Elizabeth Eddy teamed with captain Alyssa Dávila to pressure TCU’s defense all game.
The match against the Longhorns offered a greater test of the young team’s mettle. The Women of Troy fell behind 1-0 in the 18th minute, when Texas midfielder Kylie Doniak headed a cross into the net. This early goal would be the Longhorns’ only success against Church, who frustrated Texas for the rest of the match with a slew of clutch saves, including one on a breakaway opportunity.
The first half looked like it would end inauspiciously for USC, as Harrison was dealt a red card after committing a penalty in the box to thwart another Longhorn opportunity in 41st minute. That foul dictated a penalty kick,  but fortunately for the Women of Troy, Church anticipated the shot correctly, sprawling to her left to knock the ball out of bounds.
In the second half, USC embraced the challenge of playing with only 10 players, and managed to outshoot Texas 11-2. Sandoval scored for the second consecutive game after receiving a pass from senior midfielder Megan Ohai. Their efforts came up short, however, as neither team was able to pull ahead in the remaining regulation time or overtime.
Undoubtedly, Sandoval’s return is crucial to this team’s offense moving forward. The Women of Troy missed her knack for scoring last season, as she tore her ACL against Gonzaga in September of last year. A much ballyhooed player as soon she stepped onto campus as a freshman, Sandoval, a redshirt junior, contributed to the team’s first NCAA championship in 2007 and led the team in scoring her sophomore season.
Although excited about Sandoval’s return and her immediate impact, USC coach Ali Khosroshahin wants to temper expectations.
“She’s not fully healthy,” Khosroshahin said. “We can only really use her in a limited role. But she’s a great player with great vision who adds a dimension we haven’t really had.”
Khosroshahin said that his only tangible adjustment before the weekend was bringing Dávila to the inside, so she could possess the ball more often and facilitate the offense.
The other improvements were simply a result of the younger players becoming more comfortable within the system. If the learning curve isn’t too steep, the Women of Troy hope that they can begin to build up consistency and rattle off some consecutive wins. Otherwise, they might have to accept the inevitable mistakes that accompany inexperience.
“The freshmen are very hungry,” Khosroshahin said after the TCU game. “They still have to go through the ups and downs, but they’re only going to get better and grow. This group is still very young, with many new players learning. But they are committed to learning.”

One can easily get lost on the way to Moreton Fig, one of USC’s new restaurants in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. But behind a heavy wooden door and down a long hallway, the gold-tinted restaurant sits. With cozy booths and impossibly large windows overlooking the two majestic Moreton Bay fig trees (the restaurant’s namesake), there’s something comfortable and elegant about the place.
Open for business · Moreton Fig will introduce students and the public to intricate dishes including watermelon salad and grilled steak as well as a variety of wines and other drinks. - James Watson | Daily Trojan 
Born from a partnership between USC Hospitality and the Lark Creek Restaurant Group, the farm-to-table venue is the only restaurant of its kind on a college campus.
Building off the success of Upstairs Commons, a previous restaurant at USC, Director of Hospitality Kris Klinger strives to give students a familiar yet special place to eat with other students, faculty and staff.
Klinger attended USC and graduated in 1992 with bachelor’s degrees in international relations and German. During his junior and senior years, he worked as a bartender at Traditions. Klinger, who took the helm of USC Hospitality a year ago, was part of the team that opened the new Traddies in the campus center.
By collaborating with USC alumnus Michael D. Dellar — co-founder, president and chief executive officer of the Lark Creek Restaurant Group — the concept for the restaurant came to life.
“Everyone wanted a nice, sit-down restaurant,” Klinger said, referring to a student survey USC Hospitality took about the future food choices at the student center.,
“A lot of these kids have been fortunate enough to be exposed to good food,” Klinger said. “This is something that students have been ready and looking for.”
But it’s not just expensive food students wanted. According to the survey, students also demanded more sustainable options.
“Young people are more aware than ever. They want local, sustainable and fresh food. They almost expect it,” Klinger said.
When asked about what campuses he looked at when planning the high-end and sustainable concept, however, Klinger smiled.
“We wanted to do this one on our own,” he said. “No one anywhere else is doing anything like this.”
Preliminary menu items for the late summer opening include stone fruit bruschetta with peaches, pluots and nectarines on grilled country bread, summer-sweet watermelon salad with cucumber granite and baby basil, and a grilled hanger steak with béarnaise sauce and big duck fat fries. The dishes will change according to seasons and diner interest.
The wine list will feature American wines, including unusual finds such as a brandeur sauvignon blanc from Mesa Verde Vineyard. Drinks will also include non-alcoholic beverages like the university cooler, which features fresh lemon juice, fresh lime juice, raspberry puree, peach bitters, mint simple syrup, soda water and a fresh mint garnish.
With strong California cuisine influences, the Lark Creek-generated menu began as a rough concept but was fleshed out by Chef Todd Koenigsberg, who has worked with famous chefs including Bobby Flay and Mario Batali.
“The menu is designed to be totally user-friendly,” Koenigsberg said.
He spent three weeks testing concepts and recipes to prepare for the fall opening. The chef, who described his style as rustic, simple and technique-driven, describes Moreton Fig’s character as detail-oriented.
“We take care of our ingredients. It’s all thought out and prepared with love … We’re not making anything from a can. The mayonnaise, the potato chips, hot sauce — we’re making it all [from scratch],” he said.
This kind of quality can usually come at a steep price, but Klinger and his staff are dedicated to keep costs low. With seasonal items and direct relationships with growers, Klinger and his staff can charge less for traditionally expensive upscale food. Even so, with appetizers starting at $7.50 and entrées at $15.50, Moreton Fig won’t exactly be an everyday staple.
However, with preliminary plans for deals like an “all at once lunch,” which will include an appetizer and entrée for $13.50, and the addition of burgers and sandwiches, more budget-conscious eaters can also enjoy themselves.
Notably, the menu makes a concerted effort to include a comprehensive amount of vegan and vegetarian options, such as whole-braised bulb of fennel, saffron pearl couscous, English peas and pepper broth. Klinger and his department are in the process of looking for a possible all-vegan vendor for campus.
With plans to have special-themed menus for game day as well as seasonal tasting events and beer dinners, General Manager Tiffany Bosch expressed nothing but excitement about bringing fine dining to a college campus for the students and the general public.
“There’s this mystique behind college campuses — that they’re elitist clubs,” she said. “But [Moreton Fig] will allow the public to get a peek in.”
Bosch, a veteran of the hospitality industry, aims to create a haven for students — and everyone else — with a venue that could hold its own as a free-standing restaurant.
“I want [the restaurant] to be a home away from home,” Bosch said.
With such an ambitious and high-end concept, some might question USC Hospitality’s choice to move forward with Moreton Fig.
However, Klinger defended the restaurant. “It’s not exclusive,” he said. The idea came directly from student responses.
“We want to set the tone. We want to hear what the Trojan Family wants,” he said. “No one else has something like this.”

We’ve all heard the same story over and over: Experts predict a major earthquake in Southern California. We obsess over food supplies and the structural integrity of our bedside desks and then after a few days we forget our fears and move on.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
If you’re one of those people who’s become pretty sick of the entire routine, you’re like me. As a native Angeleno, I’ve become all too familiar with this sequence.
Last week, a new report from earthquake experts predicted a major earthquake (somewhere around a magnitude 8.0) is due to hit Southern California in the next few years. As always, I felt a little distraught after hearing such news but after watching T.V. and talking to some friends I forgot about it entirely.
Yet, there is certainly a benefit to this annoying cycle of being scared for a day, recovering, and then being scared again. By constantly reminding us of the so-called “big one,” earthquake experts and government officials are keeping the threat from slipping to the back of our minds for too long. If each time we hear the latest earthquake prediction we make a few preparations before our attentions spans inevitable meander back to football or Jersey Shore, we better our chances of coming out of the earthquake unscathed.
Let’s face it. As Southern Californians (and college students) our minds are constantly on the run. Our thoughts are usually so scattered that even an 8.0 earthquake takes the backseat to midterms, internships or that weird sound your car started making on the freeway yesterday.
We need these constant reminders that force us to prepare because unlike other natural disasters such as hurricanes, snowstorms and typhoons, earthquakes pose a different kind of threat.
The difference is surprise.
Susan Hough writes that hurricanes can be tracked for weeks on weather radars before they strike, as can snowstorms  and typhoons. This gives potential victims a short warning time to stock up on emergency supplies and prepare themselves for the onslaught of an upcoming natural disaster.
But the time and place of an earthquake can’t be predicted in advance, which is why it’s so important that we use the constant warnings as an alarm system, reminding us to prepare a little more each time.
Attending USC, we can be assured that our buildings are earthquake-safe and our basic needs provided for. USC’s emergency preparedness website is also helpful in telling students (especially those not from Southern California) how to prepare for, act during, and react after the earthquake.
The initial effort in making sure we have all of our personal necessities lies with us. As an Angeleno who has gone through the 1994 6.7 magnitude Northridge Earthquake, I can honestly say that you really do need to have your emergency supplies ready to go. I remember my father having to walk to the nearest grocery store (no one was driving since the traffic lights were out and some freeway overpasses had collapsed) to buy water bottles, and even when he arrived there the store only took cash.
The cost of taking the time to inventory your emergency supplies is much lower than potential problems that can arise after an earthquake. Having an adequate supply of drinking water, canned food, cash, batteries, flashlights and blankets are absolutely necessary to deal with the potential problems that can arise post-earthquake.
Frequent reminders and warnings may be annoying, but in this case they’re necessary; they don’t allow us the luxury of ignoring an inconvenient truth. We’ve all seen the immense damage caused by other natural disasters — disasters that, in some cases, people expected.
Because we won’t have that warning, we should embrace the constant stream of earthquake talk and let it motivate us to prepare ourselves rather than viewing it as an annoyance or a burden.

Three unenrolled students came to my Spanish class the first day, hoping to finagle a spot on the roster. Two doggedly returned the following class, forcing the teacher to shoo them away with a pained expression  — her class was already one over the roster limit. The students left and the rest of the class — at least in my imagination — sat uncomfortably in a puddle of survivor’s guilt; most of us were seniors and most of us, whether majors or minors, needed the class to graduate, and there we lucky few stayed.
The Spanish department didn’t fare as well during the hiring freeze as other subjects in the university — at times, walking from the cinema building to a language course at USC feels a bit like making the trek from Cabo to Calcutta. Two years after the German department was axed completely, fewer language courses are offered at USC, professors are overloaded with sections and many students show up the first day like wedding crashers with honorable intentions, hoping to slip into the class through the back door.
But as students come in twos and threes to petition spots in courses across the university, a far more dire situation is occurring at public universities and colleges across the state. With California’s budget still pending more than 60 days into the fiscal year, students are being turned away in droves from classes across the Golden State — too many students, not enough teachers. And at this most inopportune time, two California politicians have proposed a suspension of the minimum school funding in the state.
The federal government gave California $1.2 billion to provide a buffer for teacher hires. Politicians in Sacramento, however, might use the money to supplant, not supplement, the crippled public education budget in California in an effort to prop up the $19.1 billion deficit.
State Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) and Assembly Speaker John A. Pérez (D- Los Angeles) recently suggested eliminating the guarantee on minimum school funding. This way, legislators could subtract the $1.2 billion from the education budget, knowing it would come from federal coffers.
Shirking the California education system of a much-needed cashflow is not the way to reinvigorate the state economy. Los Angeles Times columnist Sandy Banks painted a grim picture in her Aug. 28 article about overcrowding at California universities. At San Francisco State  attendees looking for entry into a course wait in droves on the first day of class. Many students have to delay graduation because they can’t catch a spot in a required course.
California State University, meanwhile, is allowing students to enroll for the spring semester, but deferring news of their admission until the state budget is resolved. Students are forced to take a crap shoot on their education, or look elsewhere.
Though as members of a private university this is a problem most USC students won’t have to deal with immediately, anyone looking to do post-graduate studies at a UC school will be in for a rude awakening.
The last thing needed right now is a go-ahead to further decrease educational spending, given last year’s fee-hikes to public universities — an event that was boisterously protested by students and largely ignored by legislators. It will take a vocal show of dissent from state politicians to resolutely nip the idea in the bud, and it’s time for our representatives to provide that.
California schools, and their students, deserve that $1.2 billion, and they deserve a budget that hasn’t been shredded by politicking. Are we going to give it to them?

No public employees should be allowed to unionize — this alone is bleeding California dry.
There are a couple ways for the Governor and Legislators to deal with the deficit. They could cut education and services to the poor and disabled.  They could even raise taxes. Theoretically, they could reduce prison system waste but why would they even consider making any prison budget cuts? Fixing the broken parole revocation system and increasing correctional contract beds rather than building more prison beds would probably save a few billion. But, be serious! A few thousand students and their families have about zero political clout. Correctional employee unions have incredible political clout. If you look at the issue from that perspective, the cuts in education and services to the poor make perfect sense.

A USC Viterbi School of Engineering assistant professor has been recognized as one of the top innovators under the age of 35, according to Technology Review.
Michelle Povinelli has been working on better understanding how light moves through complex materials. Her findings will advance research in creating more efficient electronic devices.
Povinelli was selected from more than 300 nominees for the list, according to USC news.
“She continues to impress with her prodigious, high-quality research in optics and photonics. Her selection [by Technology Review] is almost a natural consequence of her talent and accomplishments. We cannot be more proud,” Viterbi Dean Yannis C. Yortsos told USC news.
Povinelli also holds the Women in Science and Engineering Junior Gabilan Chair at Viterbi.
“Professor Povinelli is a shining example of a USC innovator,” said Krisztina Holly, USC vice provost for innovation and executive director of the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation, to USC news. “In her research pursuits, she has continued to push beyond the edges of her field, questioned assumptions and used her imagination to make leaps that will surely make an impact in years to come.”
