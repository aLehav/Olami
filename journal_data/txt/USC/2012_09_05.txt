Last Saturday was a day of celebration: College football had finally returned, and USC was back to its winning ways. The Trojans trounced Hawai’i 49-10 in its first season of bowl eligibility in two years since the NCAA dropped the hammer on them after the Reggie Bush investigation. USC was ranked No. 1 in the country, and all was right in the world.
Well, almost. USC later slipped to No. 2 in the Associated Press poll, but Trojans fans could care less in light of the latest news: another NCAA investigation.
These days it seems a conversation about USC is incomplete without discussing possible infractions related to extra benefits.
Sometime before sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee’s 75-yard scamper into the end zone on the season’s first play, the Los Angeles Times reported that a former Los Angeles County assessor’s office employee gave improper gifts to former USC running back Joe McKnight and former basketball player Davon Jefferson in 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Before I go any further, I have a question to ask: Haven’t we been over this before?
The NCAA turned over every rock and looked at every skeleton in USC’s closet during the Bush investigation. Despite finding no concrete evidence that the school or athletic department knew Bush was receiving improper benefits, the NCAA Committee on Infractions slapped USC with the dreaded “lack of institutional control” label and hit the team with, which were at the time, the most severe sanctions since SMU received the “death penalty” in 1987.
After USC had the book thrown at it, college football pundits have almost unanimously described the punishments as excessive and unfair. The inconsistencies of the NCAA’s rulings on subsequent violations have been comical, particularly at Ohio State and Auburn.
What’s more frustrating about this news is that it comes at a time when USC is leading the movement to ensure NCAA student-athletes do not hurt their amateur status by accepting impermissible benefits. In fact, USC even hosted a summit reviewing prep football “7-on-7” tournaments and the amount of money flowing through them.
Since June 2010 sanctions, USC has hired a new football coach, basketball coach, athletic director and school president, and the new administration team has acted like choirboys.
In 2009, amid rumors that Joe McKnight had accepted gifts from an outside source, the USC compliance department barred the tailback from playing in the Emerald Bowl against Boston College.
In 2010, Athletic Director Pat Haden self-reported to the NCAA that former running back Dillon Baxter received an impermissible benefit in the form of a two-minute golf cart ride across campus by a sports agent. As a result, he missed the team’s next game at Oregon State while the NCAA reviewed the case.
And just last season, former USC secondary coach Willie Mack Garza resigned for personal reasons amid reports that tied him to talent scout Will Lyles, who is connected to the NCAA’s probe of Oregon.
The point is, USC has been on the straight and narrow path ever since new leadership has taken over. It’s been proactive.
We know what has happened since then: Kiffin and senior quarterback Matt Barkley have cleared the “dark clouds” that Kiffin has so frequently referenced.
After all, the idea of sanctions was to make USC suffer, not to have the Trojans emerge as national title favorites in their first season back from probation.
It would be unfair for one administration group to be punished twice for a “lack of institutional control,” especially when that group is no longer affiliated with USC, and that timeframe has already been investigated ad nauseum by the powers that be.
USC has done everything the NCAA has asked; it’s time to leave the Trojans alone.
But one never knows with the NCAA.
 
“Inside the 20s” runs every other Thursday. If you would like to comment on this article, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Nick at nselbe@usc.edu.
Agree that USC (or any school) cannot trust the NCAA due to their inconsistency and hypocrisy. The Trojans were treated about as unfairly as any team per http://www.fighton.com/NCAA.htm and everyone but the most adamant USC haters recognize this fact.
However, even the NCAA can’t punish USC for the alleged McNight/Jefferson violations because USC has done everything right in handling these cases and there was no way that anyone at USC (or boosters) was involved or could have known. Here are several articles that put things in the proper perspective:
LAT story deceptively written: http://www.conquestchronicles.com/2012/9/3/3289021/la-times-story-on-schenter-is-deceptively-written
No worry about Joe McKnight-NCAA: http://www.conquestchronicles.com/2012/9/4/3290664/why-you-shouldnt-worry-about-joe-mcknight-the-ncaa-or-ucla
NCAA will go easy on USC: http://www.ocregister.com/sports/usc-370565-ncaa-haden.html
It’s frustrating that people who have no connection to the University, trying to personally profit from these players, can have such a negative impact on the USC – a University they could care less about.
Compare that to Boosters actively paying players to come and play for their school (see Cam Newton).  It’s frustrating the NCAA and the national media don’t pick up on this subtle yet very important difference.
Yeah, in this case it was a booster from the University of Washington. The lesson learned if USC gets punished is for a school’s booster to eliminate their competition by seeking out and paying their competitor’s athletes. Pretty easy to do. Then wait for the right time and make it public.

USC’s running back depth took a hit Wednesday when sophomore tailback D.J. Morgan announced on his Twitter account that he would be having knee surgery.
Under the knife · D.J. Morgan (30), who tore a knee ligament in his senior year at Taft High School, expects this knee injury is not as severe. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“Everyone pray for me please!” Morgan tweeted. “I’m going into a minor surgery today with my knee. I’ll be out for only 3-4 weeks!”
USC coach Lane Kiffin confirmed the injury following Wednesday’s practice but declined to provide any more information.
Morgan was moved down to third string following the transfer of junior Silas Redd from Penn State. Despite this, Morgan received the second-most carries in the Trojans’ 49-10 win over Hawai’i, rushing seven times for 25 yards.
His injury leaves the team with only three healthy scholarship backs in Redd, senior Curtis McNeal and redshirt freshman Javorious Allen. Redd’s transfer helped alleviate the loss of sophomore back Tre Madden after a season-ending knee injury in spring practice, and the former Nittany Lion seems likely to get more than the nine carries he received in his USC debut after Morgan’s injury.
“It just goes back to how important getting Silas was,” Kiffin said. “We’re happy to have him.”
In other injury-related news, it looks as if junior defensive end Morgan Breslin, who transferred this year from Diablo Valley Junior College, might start in the place of senior end Wes Horton, who has been battling injuries and missed the season opener. Horton’s status for the game is unknown.
After missing the first game, sophomore linebacker Lamar Dawson and junior cornerback Torin Harris say they expect to play this Saturday against Syracuse.
Dawson would likely replace redshirt freshman Anthony Sarao in the starting lineup, while Harris would replace redshirt sophomore Anthony Brown.

The Trojans’ opponent Saturday, Syracuse, lost 42-41 to Northwestern in its opener. Kiffin, however, was quick praise the Syracuse offense after Orange quarterback Ryan Nassib threw for 470 yards, the highest total in Division I last week, in the loss.
“We’re going to have our hands full,” Kiffin said.
Despite the final result, Kiffin placed no blame on Syracuse’s offense, instead attributing the defeat to penalties, special teams and turnovers.
When asked about whether the Trojan defense needs to step up its game this week, Kiffin was quick to respond.
“Yeah, we got to play big,” Kiffin said, “especially our secondary. Last week we weren’t tested very much, and we got to do better.”
Senior safety T.J. McDonald also mentioned that Nassib and the Syracuse shotgun offense will be a challenge.
“Give credit where credit is due,” McDonald said of Nassib. “We know the ball is going to be in the air. It gives us a chance to make plays on the ball, and hopefully we can make plays.”

For a team that suffered 26 losses in 2011-12, last Saturday brought some unsettling news for the USC men’s basketball team before the start of the season: Junior guard Maurice Jones has been ruled academically ineligible for the upcoming season.
The impact of losing Jones is clear. The guard played more minutes than almost every player in the country last season.
Sidelined · Junior point guard Maurice Jones was officially ruled academically ineligible last Saturday. In 2011-12, USC relied heavily on Jones to run a shaky offense depleted by injuries. – Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
On a struggling team that was forced to give playing time to multiple walk-ons because of injuries, Jones was one of the lone sources of dependability for the Trojans. He appeared in all 32 games, logging a full 40 minutes of action 11 times. He also led the team in scoring (13 points per game), assists (3.5 per game), steals (1.8 per game) and 3-point percentage (.302).
Jones’ ineligibility is a blow to USC’s rebuilding efforts, and without any major additions to the roster it would likely struggle to surpass last season’s win total without its best scorer. But coach Kevin O’Neill wants to move forward and is pointing to USC’s newfound talent at the guard positions as a reason for optimism.
“We have Jio Fontan returning; [he’s] our captain and is going to have a great year,” O’Neill said. “We have J.T. Terrell, who is going to be really good for us as a junior.”
The Trojans also added two freshman guards,  Brendyn Taylor and Chass Bryan, both of whom could compete for playing time in a crowded backcourt.
“We’re going to miss [Jones],” O’Neill said. “We’d be better with him, but I’m confident we have some guys who can do the job.”
The Trojans as a whole enter the season with a significant amount of depth compared to last year’s squad, something O’Neill is hoping will be enough to thrive even without the 5-foot-7 guard.
“We’re deep at all positions,” O’Neill said. “We weren’t deep at any positions last year; obviously, after all the injuries … we’ve got Byron Wesley returning on the perimeter, who played 35 minutes a game last year. Ari Stewart is a proven guy, Renaldo Woolridge is proven. Those guys have all played major minutes at places.”
Assuming Jones is able to get his grades in order, the Trojans still plan to retain him for the 2013-14 season and beyond.
“He’ll have two years [of eligibility] left,” O’Neill said. “What we’re looking forward to is getting [Jones] back next year after Jio [Fontan] has graduated, and stepping right into the role of being the lead guard on our team.”
In the meantime, Terrell in particular could serve as a replacement of sorts for Jones as a swingman who can be utilized at both guard positions. As a freshman at Wake Forest, Terrell averaged 11.1 points per game. He played at Peninsula College in 2012 and was the No. 1 rated junior college player in the country, according to Swanny’s Roundball Review.
“He’s really talented,” O’Neill said. “J.T. [Terrell]’s challenge is going to be to play at the highest level and intensity at all times. And when he does that, he’ll be as good as any player there is.”
Terrell and the rest of the team will have to step up on both ends of the court to fill the void left by Jones, but O’Neill is confident that his roster can do so. He’s looking ahead to overcoming the hurdles the Trojans will face without Jones and hopes to have him back soon.
“It’s a challenge that nobody wants to have to deal with, but basketball is about challenges,” O’Neill said. “Life is about challenges, and we’re looking forward to having [Jones] back for his final two years of eligibility.”

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Though Bertrand R. Perdomo-Uclés didn’t win the April election to be named a California delegate for this year’s democratic convention, he didn’t stop trying.
Politico · After studying public policy, management and planning at USC, Bertrand Perdomo-Uclés wanted to serve his city and party. – Eric Burse | Daily Trojan
Perdomo-Uclés, a 2011 graduate of USC with a major in public policy, management and planning, worked full-time last spring on his campaign to be elected a delegate — making flyers, canvassing neighborhoods, meeting with his campaign team and raising money. He came up only a few votes short.
“I wanted to be there to represent the community I grew up in,” Perdomo-Uclés said. “I’ve always loved to serve others.”
Convention delegates vote for the party’s presidential and vice-presidential nominees and also vote on the party’s platform on behalf of their constituents.
“The party platform issues delegates get to vote on, such as the economy, education, healthcare, housing and immigration, are critical for our nation’s and my own community’s health,” Perdomo-Uclés said.
He admitted he was distraught after the loss. But through keeping in touch with the California Democratic Party after the election, Perdomo-Uclés received a call this summer letting him know room had opened up for him to become a delegate.
“When I got that phone call, I knew this was a special time for me,” Perdomo-Uclés said. “It was a time for me to serve my party and my voters in Los Angeles.”
He knew he had to attend the convention after receiving that information — even though he needed to raise $1,700 in just a few months.
Perdomo-Uclés turned to GoFundMe.com and enlisted help from a cinema school friend to film a video for the campaign. He invited his professors, neighbors, fraternity brothers in Delta Omicron Zeta and colleagues to support him by donating.
“Proud of you Hermano! ¡Sigue luchando por nosotros!” reads a message donor Charlie Arreola wrote on Perdomo-Uclés’ GoFundMe.com page with a donation of $100.
“I’ve known Bertrand for years and he has continued to be such a great support for me,” wrote Karla Barajas, who donated $5. “I know he will represent us well. Fight On Bertrand!”
“Your making all of your friends and family proud bro,” wrote Christain Rodriguez, who donated $30 online. “Represent the great state of California. I love you like a brother man, and proud to have you as a mentor.”
Similar messages and donation amounts lined Perdomo-Uclés’ page. By Aug. 20, he had raised $1,660 from 49 donations, just $40 shy of his goal.
“A lot of people went out of their way to give … they really believe in me,” Perdomo-Uclés said.
Now that Perdomo-Uclés is at the convention sitting in prime seats with the California delegation, he says the convention experience is better than he ever imagined.
“Not winning the election in April makes this all the much better. It’s making me appreciate the experience even more,” Perdomo-Uclés said.
Perdomo-Uclés said that studying public policy, management and planning at USC was a great set-up for an experience like the DNC.
“I want to make the world a better place through policy, but after attending the convention I now see that politics has to be in the mix too,” Perdomo-Uclés said.
His flight out to Charlotte was an experience in itself. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, congressional staff and fellow California delegates were all on the same flight.
“It was an awesome feeling knowing we were all headed to the same place where the party is going to be united,” said Perdomo-Uclés.
Perdomo-Uclés shook Michelle Obama’s hand at an event Wednesday morning — something he said  as though it wasn’t a big deal. He attended a presentation by Newark Mayor Cory Booker and said he has been networking with policymakers and politicians from around the nation.
“What an experience already, and today’s only Wednesday,” Perdomo-Uclés said. “Being around so many elected officials was definitely a highlight for me.”

The following incidents were reported in the USC’s Dept. of Public Safety daily incident log between Tuesday, Sept. 4 and Wednesday, Sept. 5.
Crimes against a person
At 2:29 p.m. on Sept. 4, a staff member in the Eileen & Kenneth T. Norris Dental Science Center reported receiving several annoying text messages from her ex-boyfriend after asking him not to contact her anymore.
Crimes against property
At 3:56 p.m. on Sept. 4, a student reported that a suspect removed currency from an envelope containing a birthday card that was placed in his mailbox at Arts & Humanities Residential College at Parkside.
At 11:29 a.m. on Sept. 4, a student reported that she dropped money on the ground at Launderland while loading her laundry into her vehicle. A suspect then grabbed the money and fled on foot. DPS officers responded and conducted a search but were unable to locate the suspect.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 1:37 a.m. on Sept. 5, DPS officers on routine patrol were flagged down by a cab driver with an intoxicated student passed out in the back seat of his vehicle near 7-Eleven. The officers woke the student and found her to be coherent. The officers concluded that the student did not need medical care and, after she paid her fare, transported her to her residence and released her into the care of her roommate.
At 1:15 a.m. on Sept. 5, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated student who passed out on the lawn in front of the Beta Omega Phi fraternity. The student was coherent when awakened by the officers, and they concluded that she was not in need of medical treatment. The student was then transported to her residence and released into the care of her roommate.
At 8:43 p.m. on Sept. 4, a student said he was involved in a verbal dispute with another student and she refused to leave his residence at 653 30th St. after being asked to do so. DPS officers asked the second student on the front porch of the location to leave the premises. The student complied without further incident.
At 7:29 p.m. on Sept. 4, DPS officers responded to a nurse at Keck Hospital of USC who fainted after complaining of dizziness. A Rapid Response team came to examine the nurse and she was transported within the facility for treatment.
At 8:35 a.m. on Sept. 4, DPS officers on routine patrol observed a suspect who had also been observed loitering on campus the previous day standing in front of the School of Cinematic Arts and detained him for investigation. The officers determined that the suspect had no legitimate business on campus and advised him not to trespass on university property.
I detect a new DPS policy of not transporting drunks to the hospital.   Not fair to those that got transports last year for no good reason.  Vomiting is not a crime!

Political experts discussed messaging in the presidential campaigns and upcoming events in the next nine weeks of the general election at the first installment of the “Road to the White House 2012: Politics, Media and Technology” series.
College Democrats President Aaron Taxy and College Republicans President Madeline Lansky moderated a discussion with Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, Raphael Bostic, director of the Bedrosian Center on Governance and Public Enterprise and Roberto Suro, a faculty fellow at the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy.

The weekly panels aim to provide an opportunity to listen to and take part in a discussion on topics ranging from domestic policy to the effects of swing voters.
They are sponsored by the Unruh Institute of Politics, the Bedrosian Center on Governance and Public Enterprise and the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy.
Panelists analyzed and speculated the effects of last week’s Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla. and the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. this week. Suro said that, at this point, any incident could tip the election.
“In this close of a race, any external event could produce a breakout moment for the other candidate,” Suro said.
The event also touched upon how both the Obama and Romney campaigns will define the futures of their respective parties.
“For all sorts of reasons in a multimedia era, it’s a lot harder for candidates to put a stamp on their party,” Schnur said. “I don’t know if there will be a Romney republicanism or an Obama democratism.”
The first half hour of the discussion began with the student moderators posing questions to the panelists. During the second half of the panel, the audience was given the chance to question the experts directly.
Students, including Nathaniel Haas, a freshman majoring in political science, posed questions to the panel. Haas said the discussion gave college students the opportunity to stay updated on important national events.
“It’s hard to stay informed in college, so events like this are really helpful in allowing students to stay informed about issues that are important to us, like the presidential election,” Haas said.
After the panel, Taxy said that the principal aim of the series is to foster a non-partisan conversation rather than a debate.
“It is part of the atmosphere that the Trojan Family fosters,” Taxy said. “At USC, we like to have a conversation and learn something from someone who might disagree with us.”
Lansky wrote in an email there are few opportunities for college students to express their views in a non-partisan way besides outlets like this series.
“It’s nice to take a break from the biased discussions that revolve around politics and hear non-partisan, analytical perspectives,” Lansky wrote.
The subject of next Wednesday’s panel is “The Key Issues: Jobs, Healthcare and Medicare —What Will Decide the Election?” It will run from noon to 1 p.m. in Ronald Tutor Campus Center 227.

USC held a groundbreaking ceremony Wednesday for the university’s first interdisciplinary social sciences building, Verna and Peter Dauterive Hall.
Groundbreaking · From left: Professor Leonard D. Schaeffer, President C. L. Max Nikias, Trustee Verna Dauterive, Provost Elizabeth Garrett and Professor Dana Goldman mark the start of construction on a new hall. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
In memory of her husband Peter Dauterive, USC Trustee Verna Dauterive pledged $30 million for the new six-story, 110,000 square-foot building in 2008. The hall will create space for interdisciplinary research and classes for graduate and undergraduate students in the David and Dana Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the Marshall School of Business, the Gould School of Law and the Sol Price School of Public Policy, among other departments.
“USC will be a truly remarkable place,” President C. L. Max Nikias said. “Here, the most remarkable people in the world will be brought together and unleashed to achieve the most remarkable greatness across the full range of social sciences.”
Dauterive said USC Provost Elizabeth Garrett plans to apply the interdisciplinary approach of medical research, in which teams of scientists collaborate and bring their results out of the lab to benefit the patients who most need them, to the social sciences.
“[The new center will provide] a unique place on campus where the most talented and insightful social scientists can come together and conduct research to generate solutions to the world’s most precedent problems,” Dauterive said.
Dana Goldman, a professor at the Price School, said the new effort will improve USC’s stature in the social sciences.
Several students said learning across disciplines has profoundly affected their academic experience.
“One of the the things I love most about this school is that it encourages students to study broadly in multiple fields,” said Austin Welsh, an undeclared sophomore. “There are so few people that have interests in just one field of study.”
Robin Migdol, a graduate student studying specialized journalism, agreed that focusing on interdisciplinary education is important.
“You don’t want to study in a bubble; you want to study in conjunction with other topics,” Migdol said. “You can’t work in just one area and not see how it affects the other.”
Joy Park, a sophomore majoring in graphic design and cognitive sciences, said two majors can play off each other.
“Sometimes it’s like science inspires my art. Different scientific ideas play into it. Sometimes, my art helps me look at science better,” Park said. “It helps put perspective on how both realities can play out.”
Nice article. You did forget WHERE they are building the hall, but better luck next time.

There is a great scene in Sleepwalk with Me when comedian Mike Birbiglia’s character, a stand-up road comic, emcees a talent show at an unnamed college. Barely five students are sitting in the audience.

After the show, a few students come up to him completely enamored by his presence. Their excitement is a stark contrast to the dim auditorium hall and the lonesome road life of Matt Pandamiglio, the fictional funnyman Birbiglia portrays.
The low-budget film, produced by Ira Glass and his public radio show This American Life, follows an aspiring comedian who struggles with a sleep disorder, a deteriorating relationship and defining his career.
Birbiglia’s real-life experiences informed the scene at the fictional college.
“I was those kids and then I was the comedian, so I relate to all of them,” Birbiglia said last week at a roundtable interview at the SLS Hotel about his film, an adaptation of his autobiographical one-man show.
Birbiglia did, in fact, begin his career as one of those students  when he worked at an improv club while attending Georgetown University.
“I worked the door at the Washington D.C. improv and it was like going to comedy college,” Birbiglia said. “All of a sudden, I’m consuming tons and tons and tons of the greatest comedians touring America.”
After his shift, Birbiglia said he would sit by the back wall and watch the likes of Margaret Cho and Mitch Hedberg.
Birbiglia captures this love for comedy in Sleepwalk, but instead of the one watching, he is the comedian on stage — albeit one who struggles to find his footing for the majority of the movie.
Having worked in public radio for much of his life, Glass comes from a different background than Birbiglia. Glass produces and hosts Public Radio International’s This American Life, which features quirky and often emotional stories. His mastery of storytelling, combined with Birbiglia’s appreciation of comedy, creates a film that both say has a unique universality.
“It actually doesn’t skew toward a generation,” Birbiglia said. “It’s about being a person and having a family and having a life and having dreams.”
These audiences, though, had many different reactions to certain parts of the film.
At screenings for the film, Birbiglia noted three very unique responses for one scene in particular: Some audience members laughed, others didn’t and some of those who didn’t laugh were angry with those who did. Birbiglia said he was delighted by these reactions.
“Laughter is such a visceral response,” Birbiglia said. “So the movies that move me are like Terms of Endearment or Squid and the Whale where you don’t even know whether to laugh or cry. It’s just life. It’s just too true.”
Sleepwalk, though, isn’t the first time Glass and Birbiglia collaborated. Glass first met Birbiglia several years ago after a radio producer suggested he watch a stage version of Sleepwalk. Since then, Birbiglia has contributed several times to This American Life.
Though many of the stories on the radio lend themselves to use as cinematic subjects, Glass said it was challenging to transition from audible storytelling to visual storytelling.
“Things that I would know how to do on the radio turned out to be really a challenge in making a movie,” Glass said.
Glass also said that in the stage version of Sleepwalk, establishing the relationship between Birbiglia’s character and his girlfriend (portrayed in the film by Lauren Ambrose) required no more than stating the fact with emotion. But developing a believable relationship on screen took a bit more development.
“By having an affectionate sound in his voice, you believe that they had a real relationship and that they liked each other,” Glass said. “Turning from that into actual scenes that a great actress would be able to play …   that was so hard.”
For Glass, producing the movie was an exhaustive effort. After he completed Sleepwalk, Glass said he said he would not be coming back to producing any time soon, at least in the same capacity.
“I love the movies but I feel like it’s just a weird, time-consuming, sort of a thankless job where you’re herding a lot of people into place to make something happen,” Glass said.
Currently, This American Life has several other stories being adapted for the screen, including one about cryonics and another about Carlton Pearson, a defrocked Baptist minister.
“There are about a half-dozen stories from the radio show that are being developed as films, and some of them very beautifully by very skilled people,” Glass said.
As for Birbiglia, he is planning to adapt his current show My Boyfriend’s Girlfriend into a film. He will be performing the show in several California cities this fall.

Perhaps you’re already an expert at navigating the tumultuous waters of the one-night stand — if that’s the case, congratulations.
But most Trojans aren’t quite sure about the best way to handle rolling over and finding someone they don’t remember meeting from the night before.
Don’t worry, though: A simple set of suggestions can help anybody — from newly anointed sorority girls to the workaholics who need a spontaneous night out — learn how to deal with the dreaded morning after.
The Reveal: The Fake Snoozer and The Getaway Driver
It’s morning and you’re not quite sure where you are. In the dim lighting of the 901 Bar and Grill, that guy or girl looked like a movie star.
Unfortunately, upon waking up, you’ve found that they aren’t your Brad or Angelina.
If you don’t like what you see, then it’s best to scoot away as quickly as possible. Don’t stop to fix your hair. Don’t stop to get some water. Just get back to your apartment before people start waking up.
But in the case that you actually find your new bedmate attractive, then sit tight.
It’s best to just go back to sleep or wait for them to wake up before deciding what happens next. Sometimes it’ll involve brunch, sometimes it’ll involve round two and sometimes it’ll end in an awkward offer to drive the other home.
Even though I personally believe in a hit-it-and-run-quick scenario, if it floats your boat and you’ve got some courage, wait it out. There might be a chance that this could turn into something.
And let’s say you really do need to leave but want to keep up some form of communication: You can try and leave a note of some kind, perhaps with your number for them to call.
Escaping before the other wakes up might not be the most romantic of notions — and some might even call it cowardly — but it’s certainly the safest in terms of your dignity. Nothing is worse than being asked to vacate the premises the morning after.
And in the case that they wanted you out as quickly as possible, remember that they probably went into the night wanting nothing more than a casual hookup. Perhaps, in the middle of the night, they woke up to realize how wild they had been and felt awkward or embarrassed. In any case, make them want you to stay: Leave a nice note behind and exit without making a commotion. Then see if they hit you up later.
The Waiting Game
Regardless of whether you snuck out faster than Usain Bolt or you spent the morning with your impromptu beau at Jacks N Joe, you still have to contend with the possibility of seeing them again.
So you didn’t leave a number behind — that’s fine, there’s no judgment here. Just be prepared for when you finally run into them again somewhere on campus, at a house party or on The Row.
Even if you think that the night went well, try not to get your hopes up. It doesn’t hurt to be a little cynical about the whole ordeal; in the case that they do call, it’s a pleasant surprise.
Remember: If they don’t call, it’s not a negative reflection of who you are. Come on, did you really think that you were going to meet your future husband at the 9-0 on Karaoke Night?
Just make sure you remind yourself that you are a great person regardless of your bedroom activities.
But save yourself the embarrassment of a possible dismissal once the sun rises and get out of there.

Laguna Dance Festival
Friday Sept. 7, 7:30 p.m. – Sunday Sept. 9, 2 p.m.
Laguna Playhouse
If you missed the Alonzo King Lines Ballet last October at Bovard Auditorium, the Laguna Dance Festival provides another opportunity to witness the San Francisco-based troupe in action.
The Backhausdance company kicks off the festival Friday night with a mash-up performance of their renowned works Sitting on January, Push and Love and Other Impossibilities. As part of their 10-year anniversary celebration, the troupe will also recreate a performance of an original work, Connections, and put a new spin on structurally-complicated show, The Margin.
On the second day of the festival, the Alonzo King Lines Ballet and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago share the bill with their prospective shows Dust and Light and Three to Max. Can’t make it to the Saturday night performance? Check out the encore presentation on Sunday afternoon at 2 p.m.
Though Laguna is a bit of a drive, a chance to listen to live conversations with the artistic directors and check out these modern interpretations of a classic art form makes the trip well worth it.
Mary J. Blige and D’Angelo
Saturday, Sept. 8, at 8:15 p.m.
Gibson Amphitheatre
The car horns and roller-coaster screams of Universal City will be silenced Saturday night as the powerhouse vocal stylings of Mary J. Blige and D’Angelo come to the Gibson Amphitheatre.
Time will tell if Blige decides to perform classics like “No More Drama” and “I’m Going Down” on her so-called “Liberation Tour.” But even if she sticks to a setlist from her latest album, My Life II… The Journey Continues, the show promises to be a treat.
And with D’Angelo as her smooth-voiced male counterpart, fans of R&B in general should anticipate one memorable evening.
Assassins
Sunday, Sept. 9, at 7 p.m.
Actors Circle Theatre
After a month-long run at the Actors Circle Theater, the curtain will go down Sunday night on Assassins, among the best and least
performed of Stephen Sondheim’s musicals.
A musical in which presidential assassins congregate on one stage to tell their sides of the story, Assassins is as disturbing and stirring as it is unconventional. The musical should take on new relevancy with its messages regarding gun control.
Fans of Sondheim already have tickets. Fans of American history and the blackest black humor should get theirs now.
El Colver: Living In Chaos: Capturing The Birth of L.A. Hardcore
Thursday Sept. 6, at 6:30 p.m.
Annenberg Space for Photography
As part of the Annenberg Space for Photography’s “Who Shot Rock & Roll” exhibit, photographer Ed Colver will give his lecture “Living in Chaos: Capturing The Birth of L.A. Hardcore” on Thursday night.
A self-taught photographer, Colver is best known for his photographs of the punk bands Social Distortion,  Aerosmith, R.E.M. and the Red Hot Chili Peppers and for his photo spreads in magazines such as LA Weekly, Mix and Surround Professional. Whether you’re a budding photographer or someone with an interest in music history, Colver’s lecture has something to capture your attention.
Free admission also provides an extra incentive to expand your interests in photography and learn something new on a Thursday night.

When the economy got tough and spending on clothing and accessories saw a sharp decline after 2008, the fashion industry had to step up its game.
Dress for less · As part of an iniatiative to combat the economy’s negative effect on spending, Fashion’s Night Out offers shoppers discounts, freebies and previews of fall trends. The Beverly Center is just one site of the event. – | Photo courtesy of Valentine Group L.A.
Vogue and the Council of Fashion Designers of America founded “Fashion’s Night Out: New York” in 2009, with an initiative to bring back fun to shopping on the night before the kickoff of New York Fashion Week.
With the apparel industry gaining back its momentum in recent years, fashion folks have even more reason to celebrate: On the evening of Sept. 6, thousands of stores across the United States will host special events.
Here is a rundown of what’s happening in Los Angeles.
 
Robertson Boulevard
In recent years, Robertson Boulevard has grown from a paparazzi mecca lined with local boutiques to a mainstay for L.A. flagships of European fashion houses catering to the Rodeo Drive shopper’s cool younger sister.
The Christian Louboutin store will be giving private tarot card readings, which might be worth a stop even though the shop is located several blocks north of most of Robertson’s activity. Along with offering manicures and trendy braided hairdos, Alice & Olivia’s store will have palm readers and a charm bracelet bar. And at Kitson, shoppers will be able to sip margaritas courtesy of Tortilla Republic while DJ Jordan Jones plays live.
In addition to having extended hours, many stores will also be giving away free gifts with purchases. 3.1 Phillip Lim will be handing out copies of Kill the Night — a Fall ’12 comic book — with every handbag sold. You can also check out events up and down the street at Chanel, Tory Burch, Intermix and BCBG, among others.
Melrose Avenue/Place
Stores ranging from the newest outpost of the Kardashian sisters’ boutique DASH to designer Vivienne Westwood’s upscale shop will be staying open late on Melrose for the night’s festivities. Balenciaga will unveil its limited-edition accessory collaboration, which guests can view while drinking champagne courtesy of the store,  with Vogue creative director Grace Coddington.
The recently opened Helmut Lang store will offer live music as well as a bite to eat and some specialty cocktails.
Los Angeles Magazine has teamed up with the Marc Jacobs and Marc by Marc Jacobs stores for a special night of shopping on Melrose Place.
And what stop on Melrose would be complete without a look at the famed Fred Segal, a boutique known for carrying up-and-coming men’s and women’s fashions?
Head over to The Standard, Hollywood hotel beginning at 10 p.m. for West Hollywood’s second annual FNO afterparty, where a free cocktail hour will be held poolside.
 
Beverly Center
For an evening of fun under one roof, head over to the Beverly Center, where West Coast Vogue editor Lisa Love, actress Lucy Hale and reality star-turned-model Kendall Jenner will kick off the festivities at 5 p.m. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa will even make a special address over live video.
Following the red carpet arrivals, fashion shows (hosted by Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, True Religion and Forever XXI) will capture fashion lovers’ attentions.
Then it’s ready, set, shop. Freebies throughout the night include beverages from the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf at Bloomingdale’s, foot massages at Brookstone and mini makeovers at Guess. Retailers Aldo, BCBG and ANGL will also offer special discounts throughout the night so  that shoppers can stock up on the new fall collections without breaking the bank.
Whatever your favorite neighborhood, there is bound to be plenty going on. Stores at West Third Street, The Grove and Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice are also scheduled to host events, so join hands with fellow fashionistas and prepare to kick around in the highest of heels and most fabulous of outfits.
The only rule: Dress to impress.

With the level of technology and connectedness we enjoy today, almost every news publication is readily and instantaneously available online. Why, then, would anybody want to fumble with the oversized pages and bleeding newsprint of a newspaper when they could just read The New York Times on their computer?
Lener Jimenez | Daily Trojan
They wouldn’t. It’s no secret that the market for local and regional newspapers has been in decline for years, losing ground to blogs, online media and select few larger publications.
In May, readers and members of the journalism world alike were left reeling when The Times-Picayune in New Orleans announced that the paper was cutting back from seven to three days of print a week. And just last week, The Post-Standard in Syracuse, N.Y. and The Patriot-News in Harrisburg, Penn., two smaller newspapers owned by the same media company as The Times-Picayune, announced the same distribution cutback.
There are obvious drawbacks to this — such as job loss — but the trend is not necessarily a downward one.
Though local and mid-level publications are hardest hit by the media industry’s transition to all-things-online, the decline of regional newspapers is representative of the birth of a more dynamic, people-driven form of news.
Local newspapers certainly played a vital role in the history of journalism, but think about it: A commitment to the hyperlocal means the papers often focus on mundane or trivial events and — most significantly — they are limited to the circumstances of their location. A newspaper in a small town just doesn’t have the resources, writers or skills to compete with a larger, arguably better publication. Merging small papers with larger ones will help to improve quality and efficiency.
But what about the personal touch and community connection of a local paper?
Though the caliber of the Bellevue Reporter, my hometown’s newspaper, might not compete with that of The Wall Street Journal, it was always entertaining to read about places and people I knew. The impersonality of large-scale publications is one of the most notable gripes among supporters of local papers, but once again, technology has made this argument invalid.
Just because small newspapers are dying doesn’t mean the heavy hitters will be all that’s left for our news consumers. Blogs and online publications will continue to grow as news outlets, effectively catering to a much wider variety of people and communities.
Take, for example, Patch.com, AOL’s local news website. Patch works with smaller communities to create an online version of a traditional community paper, run by a local editor. Patch is proof that online and hyperlocal journalism can successfully merge to create a platform that is even better than either alone.
Even more interesting is the trend toward participation in current events brought about by the rise of social media and online news. Online, anyone can provide input, start a debate or directly address other readers. With physical papers, the best you can do is a letter to the editor.
Rather than heralding in the death of journalism, online news media have brought readers to a higher level of interactivity and convenience than ever before.
Want quick updates on the news you care about? Just check Twitter. Want to delve further into a topic? Chances are you’ll be able to find articles and blogs written by someone truly invested in the matter.
Though the core of the journalism industry is certainly changing, this does not mean that it’s for the worse. The movement toward more dynamic, independent online publications will actually help support big and small newspapers. And most importantly, it will create an entirely new world for readers — a more streamlined, up-to-date and interactive experience.

Nicely presented Burke. Advertising money challenges still vex even the most progressive digital publishers such as Patch but eventually the trend will level out. Advertisers want engaged readers but right now it’s a traditional publishing model bloodbath (see @romenesko). Years ago I ran a multi-state chain of community newspapers thru a national war and a major ad recession and came out the other end scarred but determined to protect good journalism because it’s good business. My son is at Marshall now and a sophomore like you. I’m going to needle him into upping his game in the writing department to match stuff like you’ve got right here.

How many times a day do you check your Facebook, email and Twitter accounts? With smart phones, it doesn’t matter if you’re in class, walking down Trousdale or in line at the cafeteria — there’s a constant influx of information.
Twitter allows users to not only stay in constant, real-time connection with each other, but also with the news. During election season, it is an especially useful tool, but one that users should handle with care.
Though Twitter might be viewed within a more casual, social context (read: tweeting funny pictures to your friends), politics-related tweeting has reached soaring levels of popularity. According to an article on World Net Weekly, more than 4 million users tweeted about the Republican National Convention last week. Last month, Twitter launched a new tool called the “Twitter Political Index,” reflecting the projected views of Twitter users that day.
Considering its widespread popularity, as well as the advantages of real-time updates and a wide variety of sources and users, Twitter more than covers its bases as a legitimate source of political information. This literal at-your-fingertips access to the latest news is remarkably convenient. As with any other news source, however, there are negative aspects.
Most of us are familiar with the 24-hour news cycle that revolutionized the pace at which news is made and consumed. Yet Twitter has created an even faster pace.
In an article on GigaOM, Mathew Ingram refers to the 21-minute news cycle — the phenomenon in which a news item can blow up, be picked apart, debated and discarded for the next hot piece of information in just 21 minutes.
On Twitter, complex political debates are condensed into tiny packages. Efficient? Certainly. Thought provoking? Not so much. It’s true that some of the deep analysis and more thought-out commentary found in newspapers and online journals is lost when thoughts are condensed into a 140-character tweet.
It’s fast news, but it’s not what is traditionally thought as food for political thought.
Moreover, there is so little time between event occurrence and projection that editing is thrown to the wind, let alone censorship or clarification of words taken out of context. It’s difficult on a platform that thrives on speedy news bites to discern the important from the trivial, or even fact from a hurried Tweet-turned-mistake.
Still, news is news. Every medium has its pros and cons, and there’s no question that Twitter serves up a wealth of information in the instantaneous way our generation loves. Students can scroll through hundreds of headlines in a matter of minutes, diving deeper only into the issues that catch their eye — all from the convenience of their own account, on their own time.
For many USC students, November is the first opportunity to vote in a presidential election, and an informed voter is always better than an ignorant one. A wary Tweeter is also better off than a careless one. Students should take advantage of the best of Twitter, yet be wary of the social media site’s flaws and potential pitfalls.

The world’s largest study of tobacco use to date was published last month in the medical journal The Lancet and included Keck School of Medicine professor Jonathan Samet as an author.
Samet said the findings of this research project will serve as a benchmark for tracking tobacco use internationally.
“The new Global Adult Tobacco Survey [GATS] data provide a picture of tobacco use globally and will be a benchmark for tracking the continuing epidemic of tobacco use,” Samet said in a press release. “Hopefully, as GATS continues, it will document a decline in tobacco use resulting from global efforts to slow the epidemic.”
The GATS study surveyed more than 200,000 people from 14 middle- to low-income nations, such as Bangladesh, Russia, Mexico and Uraguay, and compared their tobacco use to those in the United States and United Kingdom. The study was designed by national and international health agencies to evaluate and improve anti-tobacco efforts.
The study found that, in GATS countries, about 49 percent of men and 11 percent of women surveyed used tobacco. While women’s tobacco use is significantly lower, the study also found that women are starting to smoke at a younger age, around age 17 rather than in their mid-20’s.
The GATS study also found that China has the most tobacco users of any nation in the world, 301 million people, and India the second most, with with 274 million people.
The United States and UK have the highest amount of smokers quitting, and Brazil and Uruguay have the highest quit rate among GATS countries. China, India, Russia and Egypt have the lowest rate.
Lead author Gary Giovino,  chair of the Department of Community Health and Health Behavior at the University at Buffalo School of Public Health and Health Professions in New York, said more resources should be allocated to implement worldwide strategies such as the World Health Organization’s MPOWER measures, which could be used to reduce demand for tobacco. He said that not doing so could have dire consequences.
“In the absence of effective actions, about 1 billion people worldwide will die prematurely in the next century from tobacco use, and most of those deaths and the health care and economic costs that come with them will be borne by lower- and middle-income countries,” Giovino said.
Bloomberg Philanthropies’ Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Brazilian and Indian governments funded the research.

There are pros and cons to finding out you’re allergic to gluten.
Think about it: Oreos, McDonald’s and basically all horrible-for-you-but-super-tasty things to eat are thrown out the window. Late night drunchies can no longer be satisfied with a burger, and eating out with your friends at an Italian place is almost painful to witness. CPK pizza? Goodbye.
But then again, becoming gluten free can open up a door of possibilities. First of all, you’re not sick all the time, and you can finally sleep normal hours without a need for a four-hour nap in the afternoon. And with all of that free time, cooking for yourself becomes exciting, new and a great way to spend your time.
Yes, it can get a bit costly — Whole Foods doesn’t run cheap — but there’s truly nothing like taking the time to prepare yourself dinner, and then relaxing to enjoy it.
If you don’t have the time to cook a four-course meal, however, then make sure you have these key products to always keep you full:
 
Gluten Free Bread
Gluten free bread is a must — easy, delicious and a great way to start or end your day. Udi’s — available at Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s — can get bit a crumby, but the taste of normal bread is still there. Great with peanut butter, turkey or basically anything, you won’t feel like you’re missing out.
 
Quinoa
Gluten free pasta can be a bit of a downer. Rice noodles just don’t have the same pizazz as that authentic Italian penne has. But have no fear, for quinoa is here. Delicious and pretty easy to cook, quinoa is great with all types of delicious sauces.
 
Rice and Potatoes
In the basically carb-free world of gluten free dining, rice and potatoes will become your best friends — just make sure it isn’t that super yummy sticky rice or the potatoes with gravy that is cooked with flour. There are so many different things you can do: From chicken and rice to roasted potatoes with a bit of pepper, the possibilities are endless.

Female students often lament that sorority rush has to coincide with the first week of class. Yet, contrary to popular belief, this first week could actually be the perfect time for rush. It’s just hectic enough to test a girl’s commitment and time management skills, but not so busy as to be overwhelming.
For the past week, we’ve seen these prospective sorority sisters “rushing” into the evenings: girls looking picture-perfect, poised in sky-high stiletto heels and glimmering cocktail dresses. Every hair’s in place, every lash lined with mascara. But it’s not all glitter and glam.
From hour-long dress-ups to house visits that last till one in the morning, the behind-the-scenes work consumes hours on end. On top of that, rush-ees, many of them first-time college students, have an entirely new and demanding schedule to adjust to. But the process may not be as dire as it seems.
Early rush allows sororities to get the recruitment process out of the way before the full onset of heavy studying, ten-page papers and nerve-racking midterm exams. For many Trojans, the first week of college consists only of syllabus-overviews and introductions, leaving ample time for rush.
Why not during Welcome Week then, you ask? The answer, with a twist of irony, is because the first week of school poses the perfect time challenge. The added obligation of class makes rushing a test of will and commitment to the sisterhood. Holding rush the first week gives girls a taste of the time and effort they will have to sacrifice for the sorority year round. Thus, sororities can attract the right kind of people for their lifestyle: social butterflies who can manage their time and who are undaunted by a busier agenda.
So, to future generations, as much as it screams “overwhelming,” rushing while trying to adjust to the new semester may be a blessing in disguise. Besides, acquisition of time-management skills is always a plus.

One of the key performers for the Trojans in their 49-10 victory over the Hawaii Warriors on Saturday was sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee, who was named a Pac-12 Player of the Week alongside UCLA running back Johnathan Franklin and Arizona linebacker Jake Fischer.
In one of his most impressive performances during his tenure at USC, Lee registered 297 all-purpose yards and proved to be a big threat when playing with junior wide receiver Robert Woods. On the first offensive play of the game, Lee took a quick pass from senior quarterback Matt Barkley and skirted past a number of Hawaii defenders on his way to a 75-yard touchdown.
In the third quarter Lee returned his lone kickoff attempt 100 yards for a touchdown, making his second score of the game. Lee had 10 receptions, nearly half of Barkley’s 23 total completions, on Saturday. Fellow starting receiver Woods finished with 42 yards and two touchdowns of his own.
Lee is coming off a freshman campaign that saw him record over 1,100 yards combined with 11 touchdown grabs. He was an All-Pac-12 second team selection and the 2011 Pac-12 Freshman Offensive Co-Player of the Year.
Franklin, meanwhile, recorded 214 yards and three touchdowns on 15 carries in a 49-24 road win over the Rice Owls. Fisher accumulated 13 tackles and a forced fumble in a 24-17 overtime win against Toledo.
