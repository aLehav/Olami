Red-hot USC men’s volleyball team travels up to the Farm this weekend for a huge two-match series with No. 14 Stanford.
Ranked No. 5 in the country, the Trojans enter the series on a six-match winning streak, with victories over No. 7 Pepperdine, BYU, George Mason, Vanguard and Menlo. In addition, all six of the Trojans’ wins during the little over one-month span have come in four sets or fewer.
At 16-3 on the season, USC comes second in Division 1 wins this year, behind only No. 2 Penn State, currently 17-3. The Trojans’ strong play has not gone unrecognized, as the team even received a single first-place vote in the AVCA Coaches’ Poll this week.
A key player in USC’s recent hot stretch is senior outside hitter Brandon Browning, who currently ranks third on the team in digs with 99 and fourth in both kills and service aces with 110 and 11, respectively.
“Everyone is motivated and really confident right now,” said Browning in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We have some really good competition coming up, so we’re really excited.”
If the Trojans aim to continue their winning streak, they will have to take down a dangerous Stanford team. Despite faltering a bit down the stretch — losing five of their past six matches — the Cardinal still sit at No. 14 in the country, with more than enough talent to take down a top-five opponent. 
One player that USC needs to prepare for is junior outside hitter Will Rottman. Rottman currently leads Stanford in kills with 245 and in service aces with 24. Rottman’s 0.38 service aces per set are good for ninth in the MPSF and ahead of any USC player. In addition, he is fourth on the team in both digs — with 91 — and in blocks — with 26.0.
The Trojans also have to worry about junior setter Nathan Lietzke. Lietzke’s 603 assists on the season lead Stanford by a wide margin, and his 9.89 assists per set rank sixth most in the MPSF. For reference, USC redshirt senior setter Chris Hall leads the conference with 13.22 assists per set.
According to Browning, however, USC cannot worry too much about Stanford’s talented roster. Instead, it must focus on its own team and ensure it brings its A-game up to the Farm.
“At the end of the day, really the only thing we can control is us,” Browning said. “If we go and do that, I think we play really good volleyball, and that’s really all that we can ask for from ourselves.” 
To avoid a slip-up at the hands of its conference rivals, USC cannot get caught looking ahead. After a trip to the Bay Area this weekend, the Trojans return back to Galen Center for a huge two-match set against No. 1 UCLA next week. 
However, Browning said that the Trojans know they must stay focused on the upcoming matches with Stanford to keep their winning streak intact.
“It’s a lot about staying in the moment,” Browning said. “Just really trying to be present, and taking it a day at a time.” 
USC will take on Stanford Friday at 7 p.m. and then again Saturday evening at 6 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.

After a bumpy start to Pac-12 play, men’s tennis will have an opportunity to improve their conference record with two home matchups this weekend.
USC began conference play last Friday with a 4-3 victory against Arizona State. The Trojans were led by junior Stefan Dostanic and senior Bradley Frye, who together took a commanding 6-1 doubles win on court one, each claiming singles victories. The duo are ranked No. 6 and No. 116 by the ITA in singles, respectively, and No. 17 together in doubles play at the time of publication. Dostanic also earned Pac-12 Player of the Week honors Thursday. 
“[Frye and Dostanic] have definitely done a lot better job of coming out and being the solid number one pairing,” said Head Coach Brett Masi in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
Two days later, the Trojans fell 4-3 to No. 19 Arizona, bringing USC to 1-1 in Pac-12 competition. The pair of matches saw USC slip one spot to No. 15 in this week’s ITA rankings. 
Masi said that improving the team’s singles play will prove vital to avoid future conference losses.
“Definitely, our singles needs to be better,” Masi said. “We haven’t done very well in three-set matches, so maybe being a little bit more clutch … when the time comes to win those bigger points.”
USC will open the weekend with a rubber match against No. 13 Stanford Friday. After losing to the Cardinal in their first matchup, the Trojans claimed a 4-1 victory in a rematch at last month’s ITA National Team Indoor Championship. 
“We were a lot more motivated the second time,” Dostanic said. “We just had really good energy. We know that we can beat them if we’re playing well.”
Masi said he believes that keeping the team’s energy up during singles play can ensure a victory.
“Both times, the team that went out in singles and kind of just enforced their will upon the other group definitely showed a dominance,” Masi said. “At ITA Indoors, we lost the doubles point, and then, we just went right after them from the get-go in singles … We just had a lot of good energy amongst our group.”
USC will face California in their second rematch of the weekend Saturday. The Trojans won the teams’ first meeting 4-2, losing the doubles point but recovering swiftly in singles play.
“We had a little bit of a letdown starting in the Cal match,” Masi said. “[Freshman Ryan Colby] was out, and then we put [graduate student Paul Barretto] in with [junior Ryder Jackson] and maybe we were mispositioned a little bit. But either way, the biggest difference was just our energy.”
The Bears have had a strong showing since last facing USC, coming off seven straight wins to climb the ITA ranks to No. 27 as they head to Los Angeles for the weekend. Cal will face UCLA in conference play Friday before visiting Marks Stadium Saturday.
Masi hopes his players can move past their rough conference opening last week and have a successful weekend of Pac-12 play.
“New weekend, new start,” said Masi. “We got to work harder than we did last week and give ourselves better opportunities to win those matches that were so close.”
The Trojans will take on the Cardinal at 3 p.m Friday and the Golden Bears at 1 p.m. Saturday in back-to-back home matchups.

The Pac-12 featured many great players this year. Oregon’s senior guard Will Richardson, Arizona’s junior center Christian Koloko and UCLA’s junior guard Johnny Juzang immediately come to mind as some of the top players from the 2021-22 season.
But the player who won the Pac-12 Player of the Year award was Arizona Wildcats’ sophomore guard Bennedict Mathurin. Posting 17.8 points and 5.7 rebounds per game, Mathurin seems to have won the trophy for good reason. 
Well, enter Washington’s graduate guard Terrell Brown Jr., who averaged 21.7 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game this season.
All of a sudden, it doesn’t look like Mathurin is so deserving.
It’s a shame because he absolutely does deserve the award. Being the best player on the No. 2 team in the country should earn Mathurin a lot of praise, but some fans and critics believe that Brown was snubbed.
I get it. I truly do. Mathurin was distinctly the best player on Arizona’s roster, but the stacked team makes Mathurin’s impact less than Brown’s. Brown was able to contribute more to Washington’s wins than Mathurin could. It’s not too difficult to understand.
The issue with that logic is that Washington only went 17-15 on the season. Arizona had 16 more wins than the Huskies after the first weekend of March Madness.
On a 17-15 team, Mathurin could have carried the same load as Brown. If Mathurin has shown he can carry the burden at times for a 33-3 team, who’s to say he couldn’t show out every night for a team barely at .500?
Brown’s supporters (Let’s be clear, I am one too, just not for this award) will point to his four 30-point or more performances. Mathurin only scored 30 points twice, but he made these performances count. Both of those games were wins for the Wildcats and were against Illinois and TCU, two teams that made the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
The Huskies went 2-2 when Brown scored 30 points or more with the wins coming against South Dakota State and Utah. See the difference?
More than just being on a great team, Mathurin has an accolade that Brown doesn’t; Mathurin is the only player to rank among the top 15 players in the Pac-12 in scoring, 3-pointers made, three-point percentage, field goal percentage, rebounding and free- throw percentage. Even when he is the only player keeping his team afloat, Brown couldn’t crack the top 15 in any of those categories.
That proves Mathurin is an all-around great player. Brown is too, but defense takes a backseat to his offense on many occasions.
Again, to reiterate, Brown is clearly the second best player in the conference. On some nights he might be the best, but Mathurin’s production contributed to a lot more success for Arizona which makes up for any slight statistical advantage Brown has. 
An aspect that gets forgotten in this discussion is the name of the award: “Player of the Year” — it’s not an MVP trophy. Brown very well could have been the conference’s MVP since the Huskies are next to nothing without him, but Mathurin distinguishes himself when the debate shifts to what the award actually is.
To most college basketball fans, Terrell Brown Jr. is not a familiar name. Bennedict Mathurin is. 
The Wildcats are a well-known team and one of the most popular picks for people’s March Madness brackets. The Pac-12 should be ecstatic that one of its own continues to set itself apart on the national stage. 
If one of the team’s players is near the top of the conference in nearly every statistical category and there’s an argument to be made that he could be Player of the Year, the conference has to reward that.
This season, no team has brought more attention to the Pac-12 than Arizona, and no player has brought more attention to the league than Mathurin. He simply has to be given the distinction.
My point with all of this is that great stats don’t mean much in the Player of the Year conversation if it’s for a sub-par team. And that’s what Washington was this season, for the most part. Remove Koloko, sophomore guard Dalen Terry and sophomore forward Azuolas Tubelis, and Arizona would resemble something closer to Washington’s roster this year. 
More weapons on a stacked Wildcats team means Mathurin’s ability to put up similar stats to Brown is even more impressive.
Brown is a great story, but he is not the conference’s player of the year.

The gym has never felt comfortable for me. It makes me sad that I have spent so much time attributing this discomfort to my own lack of athleticism. In reality, there are a few  issues perpetuated by the mere existence, structure and culture of modern gyms, including the ones at USC.  These issues form on the basis of pride to an aggressive extreme. There is a certain attitude exuded that going to the gym is the superior form of working out — that is, gym life is not merely an action but an identity people carry around and can gloat about. 
I sense this when people react with subtle disbelief after I tell them I am a frequent gym attendee — as if they wouldn’t expect that from me. I’m not really sure if it’s my short, scrawny, brown body or my feminine disposition with the way I walk and dress. But I’m well aware of its cause: hypermasculinity. 
There is a ruggedness in the gym that makes me want to temporarily evade my femininity to blend in. Perhaps it is the glance of Mr. Muscle Man when he takes a walk from his machine to scan the room smugly, or the way we learn to claim our machines before we’re even ready for them; like frantic dogs peeing every  where, we mark our territory. Maybe it’s those times when I am asked how many sets I have left, and I anxiously cut my workout short because I don’t know what a “set” is, and I don’t like being perceived. 
The experience of going to the gym is not particularly inviting to those who are not well-versed in exercise, let alone people who experience body image issues. I am constantly having conversations with people who feel that the gym is not the place to start, but a place to end up once they’ve put in the ground work by themselves. It is precisely the environment which reaffirms many of our warped perceptions of our bodies. We fixate on what we want or what we’ve been conditioned to deem attractive, and there is little to bridge the gap between our own insecurities and making progress in our relationship with our bodies. Without a workout buddy, it is a space free of affirmation or support to someone trying the activity for the first time. It is a system that advocates for fending for yourself and leaves people in apprehension behind.   
Gyms make us feel as if we need to take on an image that is not only workable and presentable but also sellable, and one that can be commodified to the desires and image-based standards of those who dominate gym culture: heterosexual people, particularly straight men. 
Thus, the gym feeds into — and perpetuates — a system of patriarchy and misogyny. We operate with the goal of blending into a culture that is created by and for men. We exist in a hierarchy that centers overt physical strength over well-being and assimilating into a masculinized culture becomes the ultimate goal. When asked the question “How much do you lift?” I wonder,“Does it matter? I am moving my body; isn’t that what counts?” I come for the endorphins and my own well-being, not for the muscle mass.
The gym allows me to clear my mind and compartmentalize taking care of myself, and this is a privilege that everyone at USC should feel comfortable taking part in — if they so choose. 
We should challenge USC to work a little harder to create spaces that are more comfortable for women, particularly women of color, and LGBTQIA students to explore their relationship with exercise. It’s USC’s turn to put some money into a diversity, equity and inclusion initiative that isn’t a leadership task force or mandatory training. 
This space, created and funded by USC, should allow us to expand our definition of effective exercising to dismantle the idea that there is any one superior form of moving your body. Through communication and marketing with the cultural centers in Student Affairs, USC can create workout events and classes which emphasize an inclusionary and deliberate approach to working out.  Let’s get some hula hoops and jump ropes and a rock climbing wall and some yoga mats and, I mean, if President Carol Folt is offering, I could put my back into some Bollywood dance lessons or a pole dance moment. 
Nonetheless, I’m going to continue to do what is best for my own well-being. As much as uncomfortable moments consist, making uncomfortable spaces comfortable to me has been an important skill to exercise. 
There is a term used in queer theory that sums up this exact experience: counterpublicity. As explored in the piece “Pedro Zamora’s Real World of Counterpublicity,” activist José Esteban Muñoz defines counterpublicity as the idea that subcultures can insert themselves into dominant media narratives to challenge them and make them more comfortable for marginalized groups. The piece explores how Pedro Zamora, a Cuban American gay man with AIDS used his platform on the MTV show “The Real World” to challenge its own heteronormative nature, bringing education about the ignored and silenced AIDS epidemic to the masses. 
While counterpublicity is a beautiful concept to combat existing structures, I realize that there is privilege to even be able to engage in this act; as a queer non-binary person of color, the gym can be uncomfortable, but as a cis-presenting man, it does not challenge my existence. There are a slew of reasons non-binary and trans students may feel unprompted to enter a space that is cis and hetero normative, including facing discrimination, being misgendered or confined to exist within the two-gender binary via gendered locker rooms. The needs and struggles of minority students that remain unaddressed are unique and complex. USC needs to take the time to actually acknowledge, understand and center the needs of those who are too often sidelined, unheard, and in this case, unseen. 
Nonetheless, as we await for USC to create a truly inclusive space for students to work out, I will continue my counterpublicity as I prance into the Lyon Center wearing all pink, channeling Doja Cat and empowering myself to exist in a place where I feel out of place.

USC beach volleyball will face three Pac-12 opponents — Utah, Arizona State and Washington  —  in the Pac-12 South Invitational Saturday and Sunday at Bear Down Beach in Tucson, Ariz. The Trojans look to continue their success and build upon their 11-game win streak.
Two weeks ago, the Trojans traveled to Florida to compete in the Stetson Sun-N-Sand Invitational and the FIU Surf & Turf Invitational. USC went undefeated on the trip, going 6-0 and dropping just two sets overall. 
At the Stetson Sun-N-Sand Invitational, the then-ranked No. 2 Trojans took on No. 4 Florida State, No. 12 Florida Atlantic, Tampa and No. 18 Stetson. USC swept all but the Seminoles, dropping only one set on court five. 
The Trojans swept No. 19 Florida International 5-0 and beat Florida Gulf Coast 4-1 on the Lummus Park Beach Courts in Miami at the FIU Surf & Turf Invitational. The win over the Panthers marked senior Tina Graudina’s 100th win with the Trojans — the 10th Trojan all-time to do so for beach volleyball.
USC had no problems on their home court Tuesday, marking their seventh and eighth sweeps on the season against Houston Baptist and CSU Bakersfield. The pair of sophomore Delaynie Maple and graduate student Julia Scoles went on to receive their 13th straight victory after beating the Runners’ freshman Sophia Hladyniuk and junior Hana Makonova, 21-12 and 21-8. 
Head Coach Dain Blanton said he was pleased with the Trojans’ performance in Florida, especially the win over Florida State. He looks to carry the momentum into this weekend’s matches.
“[Winning] gives you confidence,” said Blanton in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “But our focus is on, ‘Can we reach our potential as individuals and come together as a team and reach our potential as a team?’”
For USC, a winning streak is not the most important priority. Blanton and his team said that they stress improvement each and every day and how they can develop into better volleyball players.
“I feel like the majority of us aren’t really focused too much on the record, but more about each game individually and what we can learn from each of them,” graduate student Sunny Villapando said. “This team is really process-oriented, and we’re not really focused too much on the outcome, more about how we can prepare each match.”
No. 17 Arizona will host seven other Pac-12 schools in addition to No. 3 USC: No. 1 UCLA, Washington, Oregon, Utah, No. 11 California, No. 18 Stanford and ASU. 
USC will play three of the nine teams at the invitational. The Trojans have never lost to each of the three teams they are set to play this weekend. 
Regardless, USC still plans on playing with the same intensity as any other opponent. 
“All of us are always ready to go,” Villapando said. “We treat every opponent with the same amount of respect.”
The Trojans begin competition Saturday at 2 p.m. against Utah. The Utes are 4-4 on the season, coming off of a loss against Colorado Mesa, 2-3. They face No. 7 Grand Canyon in Phoenix on Friday before the tournament in Tucson. 
Following the afternoon match, USC plays Saturday night under the lights at 7 p.m. against Arizona State. The Sun Devils competed in TCU’s Fight in the Fort last week, winning three of their four matches; their one loss coming against TCU, 0-5. The Sun Devils played against Grand Canyon and Stanford Thursday. The Trojans are 13-0 all-time against ASU.
USC plays just one match at 11:45 a.m. Sunday against Washington. Prior to their trip to Tucson, the Huskies traveled to Tempe for two matches against Stanford and Grand Canyon.
“The girls carry the flag more than anything,” Blanton said. “They’re the example, and they’re the ones that are the face of the program.”
The Trojans begin play on Saturday with two matches and the third on Sunday.

Following a weekend series loss against UC Berkeley and a victory over Cal State Fullerton  Tuesday, USC will travel north to Eugene for its third Pac-12 series of the season. 
The Trojans, who stand at 13-6 on the year and hold a 3-3 conference record so far, will face Oregon this weekend. However, USC has dropped three of its last five following its victory over UCLA March 13.
The Ducks sport a record of 14-6 on the year but have gotten hot as of late, winning seven of their last eight games. Last season, then second year Head Coach Mark Wasikowski led Oregon to a spot in the NCAA Tournament, ultimately falling to LSU in the regional round.
The Trojans’ midweek scuffle against the Titans was a slugfest, as both teams pulled their starting pitchers by the third inning and scored double digit runs. Cal State Fullerton pulled ahead by three runs in the seventh, but a two-run homer by redshirt junior catcher Tyler Lozano cut the lead in half. A three spot in the bottom of the eighth, capped off by a RBI triple from sophomore outfielder Carson Wells, secured an 11-10 comeback win for USC.
The Trojans’ thrilling victory over the Titans earlier this week showcased their ability to produce under pressure. It’s an aspect of their offense that may lead to defeating the conference second place Ducks.
“Anytime you’re in a back and forth game where there’s lead exchanges and you fall behind a little later … it’s a good reminder going into the series that we’re never out of a game,” said Head Coach Jason Gill in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “With our offense, we can put up four runs in an inning; it’s not an issue for them. I think it’s just a good reminder going into a Pac-12 weekend.”
Recently, with the series victory against then-ranked UCLA, USC was given a top 25 ranking by Baseball America. It was the first time the Trojans earned a spot in the top 25 since 2016.
“I hope that it builds confidence. Like I told the team, they’ve earned everything they’ve gotten. They weren’t preseason anything, they weren’t supposed to be anything,” Gill said. “Any accolades that are coming their way, they certainly deserve it.”
Recognition on the national stage at this point in the year might have come as a surprise for the ballclub, but Gill hopes to parlay the confidence booster it provides as fuel for the fire as the team nears the halfway point in the season. 
“Our goal wasn’t to be ranked 25th after week five. It’s a great thing, and it’s maybe a confidence booster or some reassurance that we’re doing things right,” Gill said. “Certainly not what we signed up to do. We’d like to finish towards the end of the year at the top.”
The Ducks boast a commanding offense, averaging over nine runs per game and holding a collective .980 OPS. The high-octane Oregon bats could serve as a test for the Trojan pitching staff, who so far sport a team ERA of 4.16.
The Ducks, while not ranked, still own a 5-1 conference record and have already tested juggernauts Stanford and Gonzaga. However, the Pac-12, even with three top 25 squads, still remains well up for grabs for the Trojans. 
“You gotta play them one game at a time in our conference because you’re looking around and … you could be 3-6 going into week four and end up winning the conference,” Gill said. “The margin of error in our conference is so small that anybody could win any day.”
The Trojans commitment to fundamentals will make a difference for the squad in this series, Gill said. 
“We gotta throw strikes, quality strikes, and play good catch defensively, which we’ve done pretty much the whole season so far. We gotta put the ball in play well, and we gotta run the bases intelligently,” Gill said. “When we do those four things, we have a real chance against anybody in the country … We gotta limit free bases and take free bases.”
For USC, Oregon will serve as a test for what is yet to come from the teams at the top of the Pac-12 pecking order. First pitch is Friday at 4 p.m. in Eugene.

Pulling up at my favorite gas station after yet another week of late night production, I run through my usual routine at the pump. Put it in park, turn it off, sit in an endless silence, step out of my car, open the gas cap. 
Recently, however, I’ve added an additional step to my routine before any of this ever goes down: cry and wipe my tears. Frankly, that step can really appear any where during that aforementioned process, but more often than not comes before or after the “sit in an endless silence.” 
Many of those who have cars or know someone who drives under stand the struggle, more so now than ever before. It’s like I’m getting gas at Erewhon with prices topping the $6 mark. I might as well snag some $40 tea while I’m there. 
I realize that I am in a position where working a handful of jobs makes standing at the pump more of an inconvenience in my life. Realistically, my entire check from the Daily Trojan goes straight to two weeks of gas, so not too bad. But for many, watching the numbers soar on the panel can induce a great deal of anxiety and worry about whether it’ll be enough to get home or if it’s even worth the charge. 
A native Californian and Angeleno at that, I have heard time and time again from friends across all 50 states (except Wyoming, still haven’t met anyone from there) about how cheap their gas prices are. A bane for all drivers, California’s gas prices have more often than not been above that of the national average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
A rise in gas prices can be attributed to a handful of things: a touting war criminal, detached politicians, power outages, protests. The national drop and a California rise in prices, however, just goes to show that the west coast is the best coast — to lose all of your money at least. Apparently, having nine dollars to your name is much cooler on a beach than in a snowstorm. 
Let’s cut to some groups who actually may bite the bullet here.
Uber, Lyft and other ride sharers, most of whom take up the job as a source of extra income, may just as well end up losing money considering the price of gas. Tote around the five-star rating all you want, but no amount of stars can make up for what is slowly becoming an unsustainable hustle. Surcharges for fuel, especially when only at half a dollar, from the titans of ridesharing certainly don’t make ends meet, either. 
Most Californians who rely on their vehicle for long distance commutes are also in a tight spot. Apart from the bumper- to- bumper traffic that slowly drains life force away from our bodies, the stress of the commute seems to only be compounded by the increasing cost of it. 
Student commuters, however long their commute, must also account for higher prices alongside parking costs, car insurance, car maintenance. Oh! And their tuition. So, apart from me worrying about how to calculate the amount of hours I need to spend catching up on lectures I missed out on, now I must also calculate the amount of gas my car needs. 
My friend, Lois, who used to write a column called “Back in my Day,” would add that older adults who may not produce a high income and still rely on their vehicle will also take a loss in this system. Working less hours than the average employee or relying on Social Security benefits, older adults may end up putting the keys aside to avoid running through the fuel in the tank.
Public transportation seems like a pretty plausible alternative, but not everyone can really just opt from an hour-long commute to what can end up being a three hour extravaganza of switching from train to bus and vice versa. And don’t get me started on the “just buy an electric car” argument unless you want to purchase it on my behalf. 
So let’s try and throw around some solutions. For one, I’m not too sure if throwing cash at the problem will solve it in the long run, but it’s a nice gesture. I can’t necessarily speak on solutions for the world or California at that. However, it would be nice if the University provided some semblance of assistance to its commuter students — a space to rest, a temporary discount on parking prices or a lowered cost on USC gas. I’m sure the University can afford it, wink wink. 
Drive safe, if at all, besties.

No. 18 USC women’s lacrosse continues in conference play against Arizona State at 4 p.m. Friday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
In their most recent match versus Stanford, USC fell short in a narrow 145-154 overtime loss. Despite its dominant first half, the Cardinal went on a late 4-0 run in the game causing the Trojans to fall behind. With two minutes left and Stanford leading 14-12, sophomore attacker Shelby Tilton and graduate student midfielder Kelsey Huff each nailed one into the net, forcing overtime. 
In overtime, the Trojans took the draw control with two shots that were blocked by junior goalie Kara Rahaim. The Cardinal cleared the ball downfield to redshirt freshman attacker Ashley Humphrey who scored the game-winning goal. This was USC’s 14th overtime game, and third played against Stanford who moved to 2-1 in their overtime meetings against the Trojans. 
USC’s last match against ASU in 2021 ended in a 16-14 victory. Huff led the Trojans’ attack in the game, scoring five goals and logging her eighth hattrick of the 2021 season.
Junior defender Olivia Dooley said that paying attention to detail would be crucial going into the matchup against the Sun Devils.  
“We’re just focusing on tweaking the little things, the smaller plays that will make the bigger difference against our next competitors,” Dooley said.  
In ASU’s most recent win versus UC Berkeley 21-18, graduate student  attacker Carley Adams led the Sun Devils with five goals —  bringing her career goal total to 105. Another threat is graduate student attacker Emily Glagolev, who contributed three goals and seven assists in the win. 
For the Trojans, first year players are leaving their mark through the early weeks of this season. Redshirt freshman attacker Isabelle Vitale continues to be a dominant force to the team. She’s made quite the mark on her first season with 20 goals and 15 assists. 
Vitale hasn’t been the only standout. Freshman midfielder Catherine Lord will be another challenge for the Sun Devils. The midfielder snagged nine draw controls in her last game against the Cardinal.
USC’s first matchup will take place Friday in the Coliseum this season, as the Trojans usually play home games at McAlister Field. 
Head Coach Lindsey Munday spoke on the opportunity to play on new ground.
“There’s so much history, and so I think there’s a level of appreciation just to play in sort of an iconic venue like that,” she said. “Not everyone gets this opportunity to play D1, to step on the field with your best friends and compete. So, I think every game is special.”
USC will be hosting Arizona State at 4 p.m. Friday.

The NBA playoffs are set to begin April 16 as the NBA season moves forward into its final weeks. Around the league, former Trojans are helping their teams make a push for a spot in the postseason. 
Power forward/center Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers
The Cleveland Cavaliers currently hold the sixth spot in the Eastern Conference standings, rookie standout Evan Mobley has played a critical component to their success this season. Mobley currently averages 15.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game along with 1.7 blocks per game this season. Mobley is fifth in scoring among rookies, first in rebounding and first in blocks. His play on the defensive end is showing up in team metrics, as the Cavaliers maintain the fifth best defensive rating in the NBA this season.
On March 14, Mobley posted a career-high 30 points against the Los Angeles Clippers in a 120-111 victory. In March, Mobley and 1.5 blocks per game over an 11-game stretch. With less than a month left in the regular season, Mobley still holds the top spot on the NBA’s Rookie Ladder. 
Center Nikola Vucevic, Chicago Bulls
Big man Nikola Vucevic has been one of the main contributors on a team that is currently fifth in the Eastern Conference. Vucevic has been very productive at the center position, averaging a double-double with 18 points and 11.3 rebounds per game.
The Chicago Bulls acquired Vucevic in a mid-season trade last season to pair him with guard Zach LaVine. The Bulls already have 42 wins this season, after winning just 31 games last year and 22 games the year before, meaning Vucevic will likely make his fourth playoff appearance of his career.
Guard DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls
DeMar DeRozan, a now five-time NBA All-Star, averages a career high 27.7 points on 50% shooting from the field to go with 5 rebounds and 5 assists per game. DeRozan leads the Bulls in scoring this year and is sixth overall in the league in scoring this season. He is coming off a 14-game stretch in February where he averaged 34.2 points per game.
Against the Toronto Raptors, DeRozan scored 26 points in a 113-99 victory over his former team, as the Bulls made progress in preserving a top-five seed in the Eastern Conference. As the playoffs approach, DeRozan will look to build on his current form and establish the team as true contenders in the East.
Shooting Guard Kevin Porter Jr., Houston Rockets
Although the Houston Rockets currently have the worst record in the NBA, the team’s young core of players continues to show promise. Kevin Porter Jr. averages 14 points, 4.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game and has put on some strong performances for Houston over the month of March. He registered 29 points against the Memphis Grizzlies and 22 points against the top-seeded Miami Heat. Although Porter Jr. shoots only 39.9% from the floor this season, he holds a career high in three point percentage at 37%.
Porter Jr. is a part of a Rockets team still trying to learn how to win games as Houston has the sixth youngest team in the NBA with an average player age of 25. The Rockets will use the final games of the season to continue developing their young talents like Porter Jr.

As coronavirus case counts continue to decline — now at a 0.4% positivity rate in Los Angeles County — mask mandates are lifted and testing subsides, researchers have turned their focus to the potential long-term effects of the pandemic. Physicians across the country are now paying more attention to “post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2” or “PASC,” more commonly referred to as ”Long COVID.”  
Local USC-affiliated Children’s Hospital Los Angeles is one of more than 30 nationwide medical institutions working in partnership with the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery study. After the National Institute of Health awarded CHLA 8.3 million dollars in January, researchers at CHLA have directed their sights on the long-term effects of the coronavirus in youth and adolescence. 
Set to run over the next four years, the RECOVER observational study looks to track patients after their initial visit in 2022 until 2026. CHLA plans to enroll 20,000 patients, including adults, pregnant women and children under the age of 25. The study will track both patients who have and have not contracted the coronavirus. While CHLA’s pediatric emphasis limits those able to participate, “the study is open to all ages” nationwide.
Dr. John Wood, a professor of pediatrics and radiology and co-principal investigator for the RECOVER study, stressed the importance of diversity in the study not only at CHLA but nationally.
“It’s really imperative that we get complete representation,” Wood said. “Especially among those who have been in communities that have been hardest hit by COVID.”
Once admitted, the participants will undergo three stages depending on the degree of their symptoms. Level one will include telemedicine appointments and blood sampling, level two an in-depth extension of level one and level three MRIs, and other investigative forms of screening.  
The goals of the RECOVER’s study include understanding “the long term consequences, who are the people who are at risk for these long term consequences, and how to address those [people],” said Dr. Sindhu Mohandas, an assistant professor of clinical pediatrics at Keck School of Medicine and co-principal investigator. Mohandas also said she hopes the new study will “define the exact of the prevalence of [Long COVID],” as previously conducted studies included contraction rates ranging from 10% to 50% after a patient initially caught the virus. 
The “consequences” and contraction rate of Long COVID remain unclear and difficult to diagnose, Mohandas said.
“We don’t know how long [the effects are] lasting or whether they could even be progressive,” Wood said.
Dr. David Warburton, a professor of pediatrics and principal investigator of the study, said effects can develop in the brain, kidneys, heart and vascular systems. One particularly pressing result included chronic exhaustion in teenagers, specifically young women who previously contracted the coronavirus. 
“The classic profile is the straight A’s student who’s captain of the soccer team and now can’t get off the couch.” Warburton said, “These kids are not making it up.” 
Wood, also the director of cardiovascular MRI at CHLA, expressed concern over early “damage to the heart” in children, damage that is, at times, permanent.
“On the one hand, kids are generally better at repairing themselves than older folks at the same time,” Wood said. “ They’ve got an entire life to lead, so they really can’t afford to be burning their reserves either.”
Although Warburton described the current treatment as “supportive,” he said he anticipates the results of the study can help devise and guide future studies on treatments and medication.
“At the moment, it’s really supportive care, letting them know they’re not crazy, and that this is a real thing,” he said.
All three doctors underscored the importance of getting and staying up to date with vaccines and following local regulations.
“The best way of preventing long COVID is to prevent COVID,” Mohandas said. “If you don’t get COVID infection, you’re not going to get Long COVID.”

Zombies are thematically intriguing just as much as they are visually grotesque. Maybe that’s why films like “Train to Busan” and television shows such as “The Walking Dead” are so popular — when it comes to those living through the apocalypse, the urgency of survival against violent, flesh-eating monsters often outweighs individual morality.
During the beginning of the spring semester, I binge watched the hit South Korean Netflix television series “All of Us Are Dead.” Set in a South Korean high school, the series traces the beginning of a zombie virus outbreak and follows a group of students who must make sense of their surroundings to survive. Audience’s witness the demise of loved characters and their disintegration into unrecognizable monsters. 
Visual effects are critical in capturing the disintegration, making the transition into a zombie all the more striking. Where the mere thought of a zombie apocalypse is terrifying, seeing these zombies come to “life” is even more terrifying because of the way the physical horror creates an emotional effect. 
It only feels like a few seconds before a lovable character’s eyes become bloodshot, her nose starts bleeding, her bones crack and her joints twist. She’s no longer a best friend, but a monster. 
All of that is to say, when both themes and visuals intersect, the narrative becomes incredibly powerful. In the YouTube video “All of Us Are Dead: Before & After VFX! (Unseen Behind The Scenes!),” The Film Bee compiles behind-the-scenes footage of the show and talks about how computer-generated imagery, or CGI, is minimally applied to certain scenes to enhance a sense of the setting. 
In one scene, a whole CGI schoolyard was created and added through the use of a blue screen after production to “add more layers” to the school and show its expansiveness. CGI simultaneously provides the audience with a broad idea of the high school’s physical space while surveying the space’s limitations during fights with zombies. 
When there are only a few physical means of escape, the concepts of sacrifice and friendship forcibly come to the surface. “All of Us Are Dead” fascinatingly depicts that all-consuming kind of confinement. While the tv series is a live-action adaptation of the original Webtoon and largely relies on practical effects significantly more so than digital ones, there’s no denying that images and the digital arts do have an overlooked presence in the show.
Whenever I’m thinking about the soul-crushing impact of South Korean zombies and their social messaging, I will inevitably think about another South Korean piece of zombie media: the 2016 animated film (and prequel to ‘Train to Busan”) “Seoul Station.” “Seoul Station” tells the story of a former sex worker named Hye-sun’s fight to find safety as Seoul faces a zombie apocalypse. 
While “All of Us Are Dead” relies on physical choreography to coordinate and mimic zombie movements, the zombies of “Seoul Station” appear to move jerkily. Even as they seemingly move without agency, these zombies have their own type of “choreography.” 
What makes “All of Us Are Dead” and “Seoul Station” different is that one is live-action and the other is animated. What both have in common, however, is the ability to stylize zombies to maximize their impact. For both, blood splatters and bulging veins are part of the standard image, often evoking fear for many who are witnessing the transformation of a loved one. 
Some slight visual nuances distinguish the two. In “Seoul Station,” for example, pupils evidently shrink in size and lose their personality, furthering the idea that the person who the zombie was before is gone. In “All of Us Are Dead,” the eyes are primarily rimmed with blood to emphasize one’s “zombie” status.
Yet, in both, there’s a visual focus on the sheer size of those who have become undead and their threat to those still alive. It’s a stunning way of showing the forces up against our protagonists and underscores our need to root for them.
When it comes to evaluating these two pieces of zombie media, it’s worth thinking about how visuals have shaped our conception of zombies. There are definite reminders of what “monstrosity” is in the grotesque characteristics. Still, all revolve around the loss of humanity: the idea that someone is no longer complex and human. 
In the visual effects and animation of the setting and the characters, all the storytellers involved in “All of Us Are Dead” and “Seoul Station” have shown audiences just how terrifying the prospect of an apocalypse is. By creating these visceral images that leave lasting imprints on the audience’s mind, we’re told to think about how we can survive — and what survives us.

Researchers from the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences issued findings Feb. 10 about the function of synapse-associated protein 97, its mutations and relation to schizophrenia formation in the brain. 
Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disease which affects 20 million people worldwide and requires life-long treatment and medication. While scientists attribute the formation of schizophrenia to a combination of genetics and environmental factors, the exact cause and location of schizophrenia in the brain is largely unknown. 
Yuni Kay, a doctoral student studying neuroscience and co-author of the study, said the study is distinct among other research because the findings highlight the importance of analyzing SAP97 in different brain regions. Through research in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the center for memory in the brain, researchers found the molecular and cellular functions of SAP97, which Kay attributed to the lack of variety in the brain regions that were studied in the past. 
“Not only do we find the role for this protein, we found out why people weren’t able to figure it out before,” Kay said. “Why didn’t people know what [SAP97] did? Because they were looking in the wrong place. Where is it? It’s in the place where schizophrenia is strongly also implicated. It was like the puzzles were starting to fit together.”
Lea Decarie-Spain, a postdoctoral researcher in the department of biological sciences and co-author of the study, said the physiology work done by Kay and Bruce Herring, an assistant professor of biological sciences and co-author of the study, focused on targeting specific protein codes and genetic expression to replicate genetic phenotypes in rats. 
“[The study] is showing what the impact of this protein has on neuronal activity … it’s definitely advancing knowledge just in relation to general neuroscience,” Decarie-Spain said. “I’m hoping that this will bring some new insight into therapies for schizophrenia, because they’ve shown that the specific molecule that they target is highly involved in the risk for schizophrenia.”
When patients with schizophrenia are being treated, they are usually only treated for their symptoms which will “rarely, if ever, cure the disease,” said Anna Pushkin, a doctoral student studying neuroscience and co-author of the study. 
Schizophrenia’s symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, ﬂat affect, the loss of a sense of personal identity, poor executive function and deﬁcits in memory. She also said that analyzing contextual memory in the hippocampus would give clues to understanding more about the disorder’s origins. 
Pushkin said future steps to curing schizophrenia could include assessing specific mutations of the protein for each symptom and behavioral phenotypes to assist translational research, which healthcare workers can then use to benefit patients. The linkage between mutations and impaired contextual memory is historically linked to the onset of schizophrenia which scientists are able to confirm and investigate more in depth as technology improves.
“There are specific regions that might be more implicated with mutations in schizophrenia,” Pushkin said. “We don’t know the specific mechanisms of what’s going on, where  in the brain, what’s happening, where specifically it’s happening, and just knowing fundamentally what’s happening at a synaptic, at a molecular level will help to create treatments for those with developmental disorders.”

This review contains spoilers.
Spring is the season for Independent Student Productions and taking magical realistic trips to places like Virgin Creek, the namesake of ART/EMIS’s latest immersive theater piece, written and directed by senior theater major Samantha Vargas.
“Virgin Creek,” tells a deeply feminine and intersectional story about the faith, love, and memories that shape one’s childhood” and follows three main characters, Mari (Mad Anderson/Sam Gajardo), Rina (MJ Jin/Mikealla Wegner), and Valeria (Sophia Lyman/Alexis Cruz), and the first two’s journey to the mystical Virgin Creek.
Audience members experience an unconventional way of viewing the piece, at least at first glance. The Massman Theater allows for standing room in the center of the theater (with the exception of seating for the elderly, pregnant women, and people with disabilities), and the entirety of the action takes place around them in a clockwise format. Despite being just a one-hour show without intermission, Vargas packs an incredible amount of content, leaving viewers to grapple with what they are watching during and after the show. 
This extremely distinct and intimate roundabout method of storytelling takes inspiration from medieval pageant wagons and the mystery cycle, wherein performers at the time would go from one set to the other to tell famous religious tales for an audience. This implementation is cleverly in line with the show’s religious themes, as Catholicism drives most of the conflict throughout the plot.
ART/EMIS’ remarkable and notable fusion between art and media is heavily apparent in regards to the show’s design. Each set is distinctly different from the last, and the simple design allows actors to easily manipulate the set in any given scene to indicate change, such as the rearrangement of chairs transitioning an early scene from a coffee shop to a car on the road. 
With the concept of nature playing a huge role in the overall scope of the show, sound designer Will Forker, a senior majoring in geodesign, and lighting designer Yajayra Franco, a junior majoring in lighting design, work together to time the appearance of natural phenomena, such as thunder, lightning and the sunrise, as they sporadically occur in the supposedly serene environment of Virgin Creek. The emphasis on individual visual pieces is also distributed throughout the sets, such as the attention to detail in makeshift shrines and paintings, courtesy of set designer Tania Apshankar, a junior majoring in creative writing, and artist Aasha Natsuko Dev, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies. 
The extremely fascinating and immersive experience would not be complete without the undeniable chemistry between the three characters, which they could only achieve through the inevitable bonding throughout the rehearsal process.
“My favorite part of the rehearsal process [was] just getting closer to my cast and crew,” said Lyman, a freshman majoring in international relations. “Everyone here is so kind and warm and inviting. It’s one of the best casts I’ve ever worked with.”
The play is riddled with an uncomfortable tension between Mari and Valeria at the beginning and the growing sexual tension between Rina and Mari throughout their time together. This all comes to a head in one of the final scenes, where the audience is met with a dissonant mixture of uncomfort and sexual tension between Mari, having a previously established troubled history, and Rina, about to reveal her side of their twisted story, that keeps the audience’s jaws open from unease and overall shock — a sign of successful engagement.
“I  want audiences to take away that it’s really okay to be … fragmented,” said Anderson, a junior majoring in theatre. “I love the juxtaposition of those two characters, where Mari is so obviously fragmented, and Rina just opens that up for her … When you want love, you’re deserving of love, regardless of where you’re at in your life.”
The dynamic characters of “Virgin Creek” illuminate the complicated intersection between faith and love according to Jin, a freshman majoring in Theatre.  The strong storytelling and deep meaning to “Virgin Creek” allows audience members to understand this convergence. 
“I’m personally connecting to these things more than I would have before because I wasn’t necessarily raised Christian,” said Jin, a freshman majoring in theatre. “I had this deeper understanding of the intersectionality,  [between] femininity and queerness and Christianity. It’s really eye-opening. I’m really glad to be creating queer theatre right now … with a feminine central story to it.” 
Although the story takes a more somber tone that would usually fall under the realm of queer unhappiness — a trope often seen in stories centered around queer individuals in strict religious environments — what sets “Virgin Creek” apart is the glimmer of hope offered at the very end shared between Mari and Valeria.
“Relationships take on many forms,” Lyman said. “They can be very complicated, especially to those that are in the relationship, and love, in the same aspect, takes on many forms. Sometimes it doesn’t work out, sometimes it does. But, at the end of the day, it’s love that drives us apart, but mainly drives us together.”
“Virgin Creek” opened March 23 and will run through March 27. Content warnings for the show include violence, implied death, and flashing lights.
