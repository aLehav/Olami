Despite a first career start for freshman Jonah Mathews, the headline of Sunday’s 82-79 victory over Arizona State revolves around the play of juniors Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart. 
McLaughlin played 39 minutes and notched 18 points, including 12 from behind the arc. His eight assists pushed his career total to 368 and moved him past Gus Williams and Daniel Hackett to fifth all-time on the USC career assists leader board. 
Stewart led the game in scoring with 29 points. He matched a career-high seven 3-point field goals made, and as a team USC tied a season-high 14 threes made requiring only 27 attempts in their effort.
Only one week ago, the Trojans struggled mightily from three, hitting only three of 19 at Colorado. In the first halves of their last four games, the Trojans shot a measly 6-for-35 from downtown. In tonight’s first half, they quickly reversed that trend with eight successes on 17 attempts.
“You can’t shoot terribly every game,” head coach Andy Enfield said after the win. “Eventually the law of averages works itself out.”
Stewart helped awaken the slumbering Trojan offense with his performance on Sunday night. Entering the game, he averaged less than 10 points-per-game in conference play in part because he had only been attempting nine shots per game. Today, he scored 13 of USC’s first 21 points, and he did not let two early airballs keep him from shooting prolifically. The junior attempted 19 shots and made 11.
With redshirt senior forward Charles Buggs out with a sore left knee, Enfield decided upon a four guard lineup. “Do-it-all” freshman guard De’Anthony Melton and freshman guard Jordan Mathews complemented the backcourt with their all-around play. Melton, although scoreless, had eight assists, six rebounds, two blocks and two steals. Mathews had 14 points including two game-securing threes down the stretch, and also led the team with three steals.
“I pride myself on the defensive end,” Mathews said. “I try to bring my energy to defense first and transition that to offense.”
Fellow freshman Nick Rakocevic also stepped up to the plate tonight. In the face of Buggs’ nagging knee injury and Boatwright’s prolonged absence, Rakocevic has earned a lot of minutes this season. He had several key putbacks at the rim on his way to tallying 11 points and eight rebounds. 
“[Rakocevic] gave us great energy,” Enfield said. “It was one of his best games of the season. He’s really matured. Putting him in for the length with Chimeze in the zone helped us stop the dribble penetration. I think that’s why we held the lead.”
Trojan rookies and veterans did their part, but USC’s inexperience almost cost them to game. ASU drew the game very close in the final minutes and nearly took it to overtime. With 1:30 to play, ASU began to press and Mathews could not inbound the ball. He first inbounded it to Metu in traffic, and ASU forced a jump ball. Later, the refs called him for a five-second violation.
“That was a new position for [Mathews],” Enfield said. “It was a learning experience. It’s nice to learn when you win.”
This season Enfield’s squad has been forced to play beyond its years in the wake of losing Julian Jacobs and Nikola Jovanovic to the draft, Katin Reinhardt, Darion Clark and Malik Martin to other colleges, and Boatwright and Buggs to injuries. Sports statistician Ken Pomeroy  ranks the Trojans as the 327th team in game experience, but their close contests this season have forged both grit and maturity. 
“We’ve been inconsistent this year, but we play hard,” Enfield said. “We block shots, we steal the ball. We play small. We play big. We’ve got a special group here.”

The Trojans may have lost to UCLA 74-59 just a few days prior, but on Sunday, the team jumped at the chance for redemption against their crosstown foes. With junior forward Kristen Simon back from absence and senior guard Courtney Jaco on fire from 3-point range, the Trojans looked like a vastly different team. Although they took No. 13 UCLA to the brink, the Women of Troy fell just short in a heartbreaking 71-67 loss. 
“What a great basketball game,” said head coach Cynthia Cooper- Dyke. “We played with a lot of heart all game long.”
During the first quarter, the game began to resemble the Bruins’ lopsided victory on Wednesday. UCLA rode a 9-0 run into a 21-10 lead, and initially USC had no answer for standout guards Jordin Canada and Kennedy Burke. But when the Trojans’ rematch started to look bleak, they refused to fade away.  Sophomore Aliyah Mazyck’s eight first quarter points kept them afloat, and then consecutive threes, one by Jaco and the other a buzzer beater off the bank for junior Sadie Edwards, put the team in striking distance. 
If the first quarter was exciting, the second was explosive, with each team trading blows like two boxers in a prize fight. The Bruins struck first, once again embarking on a 9-0 run that extended the lead to 11 points, their largest of the game. Then, Jaco, who recorded a career high of 27 points against UCLA earlier this week, burst back into the spotlight. She made two straight threes that were part of a 10-0 run, bringing the Trojans to within one point. 
But Jaco wasn’t finished. With just 20 seconds left in the half, she nailed a spectacular three while drawing a foul. Upon making the free throw, her four-point play gave the Trojans a 38-36 lead, their first advantage since the early first quarter. 
“You just get up for these games,” said Jaco, who finished with 18 points. “It’s rivalry week and this is my last one as a Trojan so it meant a lot to me personally and I just wanted to give it everything I had.”
Much like the frantic first half, neither team was able to secure a solid lead in the final two quarters.  When the third quarter alone featured three ties and three lead changes, it became clear that fans at the Pauley Pavilion would be treated to a photo finish. 
The Bruins emerged from the carnage of the third with a 55-53 lead and continued gaining momentum in the fourth thanks to the scoring efforts of freshman guard Jordin Canada, who finished with 23. Her former high school teammate, Jaco, kept the game close with a deeply contested three as the shot clock expired. It was her fifth 3-pointer in the game, and her twelfth in two games against UCLA this year. 
“Hats off to Courtney [Jaco], I thought she played excellent in both games,” Canada said. “I’m just proud of her and how far she’s come. It was really great playing against her and I think she went out on a great note. We tried to stop her down the stretch and she still found a way to score.”
After Jaco’s three at the beginning of the fourth, the two teams remained neck and neck. On two occasions, the returning Simon tied the game up, with her pounding inside play being the Trojan’s most effective offense down the stretch. UCLA’s freshman guard Kennedy Burke, who finished with 23, scored five straight to extend their lead at 67-62. The Trojans were in need of a big play with just under two minutes left and this time Mazyck delivered, nailing a corner three. Down by three with 21 seconds left, graduate transfer center Ivana Jakubcova sunk a tough layup to make the game 68-67. 
With 15 seconds left, the Trojans quickly fouled Burke, sending her to the line. Burke made the first but then granted USC the ultimate opportunity, with her second bouncing off the rim. However, no Trojan came up with the rebound; instead it was Canada, UCLA’s unquestioned leader, who played all 40 minutes of the contest. The offensive rebound effectively ended the game, capping an instant classic.
“It doesn’t matter what your record is in this rivalry,” said UCLA head coach Cori Close. “You just might as well throw that thing out and let’s go compete.” 
The Women of Troy return to action on Friday at home against Arizona. They now drop to 1-7 in conference play and 10-9 overall.

On Friday, nearly 200 people stood at the Von Kleinsmid Center in the pouring rain. They were there to protest the inauguration of President Donald Trump, as they heard speeches from members of the Black Student Assembly, the Muslim Student Union, the Student Worker Action Group and the Price Student Organizations Coalition. Christina Gutierrez, a third-year graduate student majoring in public administration and urban planning, spoke about the importance of granting support to underrepresented communities, including black, Latino/a, LGBT and undocumented students.
“It is students who have to fight for equity and justice,” Gutierrez said. “It’s appalling that [the University] doesn’t do so much to support undocumented students.”
While both parties have support on campus, most of the protests and rallies have been visibly anti-Trump. From the night of the election to the days preceding Trump’s inauguration, members of the USC community have mirrored a series of protests occurring worldwide, making the campus a hub for student activism. This wave of resistance is relatively new for USC, which is not historically known for being politically active. 
The rallies and protests against Trump on campus have not only involved students and staff from USC, but also students from local high schools. Two days after the election, teens from South Los Angeles staged a walkout, joining some USC students who had organized a “human wall” along Trousdale Parkway.
The protests have not solely concentrated on students’ dissatisfaction with the election results, but also on the inclusion of underrepresented students at USC.
The proposal for USC to become a sanctuary campus, which would protect undocumented students, faculty members and their families from deportation under the new presidential administration, has ignited discussion on campus. The initiative was introduced by a faculty-driven petition, and supported by an Undergraduate Student Government resolution, that urged the USC administration to protect undocumented students.
USG Director of Community Affairs Mai Mizuno said that after attending a talk by L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti about Los Angeles’ status as a sanctuary city, she came to believe USC should declare itself a sanctuary as well as a symbolic gesture.
“My hope moving forward is that USC adopts a similar tangible legal initiative [like Los Angeles] that really institutionalizes the idea of a sanctuary campus,” Mizuno said.
Two days before Trump’s inauguration, faculty members organized the Rally for Inclusion and Tolerance, where professors shared speeches and book passages that encouraged those in attendance to know their rights and continue to be in solidarity with those who are underrepresented.
Nadja Barlera, a senior majoring in English, attended the rally and said that it was a “good first step” for USC professors to creating a more inclusive campus.
“It’s important for faculty to speak because they are part of our community too, and they are affected by policies,” Barlera said. “It’s also important for them to make these sorts of public statements so that students feel safe and supported.”
While these rallies and protests have recently begun at USC after Trump’s election, in the past USC has not been known for political and social justice resistance. Campuses such as UC Berkeley, which saw the birth of the Free Speech Movement in the 1960s, are viewed as more politically active, according to some students. 
“USC is known as the campus that is mild when it comes to political activism,” Collins said. “[But] it is part of our democracy to speak [our] grievances when [we] have them.”
Beyond college campuses, USC students participated in worldwide Women’s March as an act of protest against the rhetoric of Trump. Maddie Hengst, assistant director of Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, was one of the many in attendance.
“The Women’s March was an important step in invigorating activists across campus, and the country, by restoring hope and purpose,” Hengst said. “But that being said, it’s important that the folks involved take further action steps, such as contacting representatives in Washington and donating or volunteering with organizations. SAGE recently has been advocating on behalf of Planned Parenthood.”
Despite this perceived historical apathy, members of the USC community such as Billy Vela, the director of El Centro Chicano, have highlighted the importance of having students speak out in this way.
“These demonstrations are important because I see our students engaged in meaningful issues of our time,” Vela said. “These issues are real, they impact lives and families. They are at the core of what higher education is all about at a local, state, country and global level.”

The repatriation of unauthorized foreign nationals is perfectly just and sound policy. Virtually every nation on earth enforces its borders.
Activision must address int’l students too, because being one isn’t easy, given our complex culture and language. Assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   One such new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.  
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Good luck to all at SC or wherever you study!

The 6th Annual Latino Student Empowerment Conference took place this Sunday. Hosted by El Centro, Latina/o Student Assembly, American Studies & Ethnicity, Sociology, Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration and the Latino Graduate Student Association, the conference aimed to provide students at USC support for research, academic success and social justice activism. The event co-sponsored by IDEAS at USC, the Latino Student Business Association and the USC Career Center.
The research presentations ranged from urban schools closing the achievement gap to the transitional experience for first generation students which were presented by current undergraduate and graduate students. The conference also included a book panel and workshops for applying for scholarships and fellowships.
“The purpose of the conference is to give our undergrad and grad students an opportunity to present their research and/or do workshops,” said Billy Vela, the director for El Centro Chicano. “To empower them and empower our community so we really want to encourage social justice, critical thinking and activism on every level. We wanted to give spring admits — both undergrad and grad — a chance to get involved in the community that seemed organic and inviting.”
Edwin Saucedo, of Undergraduate Student Government, was the opening keynote speaker and Wendy Carrillo, an alumna and political radio host who is running for Congress, was the closing speaker for the conference. Saucedo and Carillo spoke passionately about their experiences as USC students.
“I think it was the first time I really felt out of place. I looked around the room and saw that I was the only one that looked like me,” Saucedo said. “They don’t hear about our experiences.”
Andrea Diaz, a freshman majoring in economics, works at El Centro Chicano as special projects assistant. She spoke about adjusting to the support and networking opportunities she’s received through El Centro Chicano and the change in diversity.
“It’s definitely different because I come from a predominantly Hispanic community, and now it’s not like that,” Diaz said. “It’s nice to find communities where you feel comfortable and empowered, but at the same time I applied [to USC] and I got in. I have to remember I worked hard, so I just have to continue to work hard even in a different environment.”
Diaz encouraged other students to attend similar events.
“When people don’t reach out for help and don’t come to conferences like this, they feel like they’re alone,” Diaz said. ”It’s really amazing that all these speakers are here with the sole purpose to help other students and to know that people are here to help me.” 
One of the groups present at the conference was IDEAS at USC, an organization founded to create a safe space for undocumented students and allies. Kimberly Alvarado, who is marketing director for IDEAS, spoke about undocumented students at USC.
“I did a year at a community college [at] El Camino so the environment was very different from USC — the diversity and the culture,” Alvarado said. “Being at USC as a Latina female, I am sometimes the only minority in my class, but at conferences like this I do feel empowered.”

Matt Karatsu | Daily TrojanPerfect set · The men’s tennis team took down UC Riverside and UC Irvine in a doubleheader on Saturday to maintain its perfect record.
The No. 10  men’s tennis team improved to 3-0 on the season over the weekend, notching two victories in a Saturday doubleheader at Marks Stadium. The No. 10 Trojans have claimed all three of their wins this spring against UC schools. They earned their first of the season with a 6-1 win against UC Santa Cruz last Monday and earned two more versus UC Riverside and UC Irvine on Saturday afternoon.
UC Riverside was first up, and USC breezed to a 7-0 sweep over the Highlanders. The Trojans established their dominance early in doubles play: A quick victory from the pair of senior Rob Bellamy and sophomore Jake DeVine set the tone, before junior Thibault Forget and sophomore Jack Jaede teamed up to clinch the doubles point for USC and give their team a 1-0 lead.
The Trojans then turned to singles play. Bellamy followed up his doubles dominance with an impressive solo effort, shutting his Highlander opponent out in straight sets, 6-0, 6-0. Though he wasn’t able to match Bellamy’s performance, freshman Riley Smith also won in straight sets, 6-0, 6-2, to extend USC’s lead to a commanding 3-0.
Junior Jens Sweaney then edged UC Riverside’s freshman Olivier Kigotho 6-3, 6-1 to clinch the match for USC. It was Sweaney’s first career match-clinching win in Cardinal and Gold, and three more Trojan wins in singles play capped a 7-0 shutout against the Highlanders.
USC grabbed its second win of the day against UC Irvine by a similar score line, but the Trojans’ 6-1 victory over the Anteaters came after a considerably stiffer challenge in doubles play. Smith combined with fellow freshman Brandon Holt to open the match with a victory, but the pair of redshirt junior David Laser and sophomore Logan Smith fell in their doubles matchup to set up a decisive third contest. Senior Nick Crystal and sophomore Laurens Verboven were tasked with bringing home the doubles point to USC, and they fought through a grueling tiebreaker to snatch a 7-6 (4) win and a 1-0 Trojan advantage.
Things went more smoothly for USC in singles. Forget cruised to a 6-0, 6-0 win to double his team’s lead, and DeVine’s 6-1, 6-1 win put the Trojans on the brink. Jaede put the finishing touches on his 6-2, 6-1 victory just seconds later to clinch the match and bring USC to 3-0 on the season.
With momentum on their side, the Trojans will now set their sights on the ITA Kick-Off Weekend, which they will host at Marks Stadium next weekend. USC won the tournament last season, edging Tulane 4-3 in the championship match.

The track team started out the year with a bang at the Rod McCravy Invitational in Lexington, Ky. Saturday. Junior Kendall Ellis set the school indoor 400-meter record and both the men’s and women’s 4×400 meter relay teams took home first place. Redshirt sophomore Marquís Morris, redshirt junior Nick Ponzio and redshirt senior Just’N Thymes also placed second overall in their respective individual events.
Ellis placed second with her record-breaking time of 51.52 seconds, coming close behind Miami senior Shakima Wimbley’s time of 51.28 seconds. Her time reduced her previous personal record by 1.25 second while also breaking the previous school record of 52.22 seconds, which was set by senior Jaide Stepter last season. 
Freshman Kyra Constantine ran the 400-meter event as well, winning her heat and finishing 12th overall with a time of 54.24 seconds. The race earned her the eighth spot on the Trojans’ all-time indoor 400-meter times.
The women’s 4×400 meter relay team, consisting of senior Cameron Pettigrew, senior Amalie Iuel, Constantine and Ellis, finished with a time of 3:31.72 minutes, moving to become third-fastest on the Trojans’ all-time indoor record for the event. Only three of the 14 teams participating in the 4×400 event finished under 3:35.75 seconds, putting considerable distance between themselves and the opposing teams.
The men’s 4×400 meter team had a similarly fast-paced day, posting the second-fastest time for the event in school history at 3:07.80 to finish in first place. The team consisted of junior Ricky Morgan Jr., junior Robert Ford, redshirt sophomore Zyaire Clemes and Thymes.
Thymes also succeeded during his individual event, placing second in the 60-meter dash and setting a personal record with his time of 6.7 seconds. 
Junior Dominic Smallwood and redshirt junior Eric Sloan also ran the 60-meter event, finishing side-by-side at 24th and 25th with respective times of 7.21 seconds and 7.27 seconds. Also taking second in a personal event was Morris, who set a personal record with his 7.81-second finish in the men’s 60-meter hurdles event. 
Ponzio also took home a second place finish in shot put after improving steadily to a final throw of 18.87 meters. Sophomore Matthew Katnik started out third overall in the shot put event, but fouled in his final three attempts to finish in fifth. 
On the women’s side, redshirt senior Brittany Mann placed third overall in shot put with a 16.49-meter best throw. That mark placed her second in the program’s history.
Two Trojans placed in the women’s 60-meter hurdles event, with freshman Anna Cockrell finishing sixth and redshirt sophomore Dior Hall placing seventh. This was Hall’s first return to competition following an ACL-tear that sidelined her in December of 2015. 
Junior Deanna Hill and redshirt sophomore Ky Westbrook both placed in the 60-meter dash finals, with Hill taking fourth with a time of 7.37 seconds and Westbrook taking seventh with a 7.43-second finish. 
Redshirt senior Lorea Ibarzabal took eighth in the 800-meter event, moving to sixth-place in Trojan history with a time of 2:10.20 minutes. Sophomore Mikaela Smith finished slightly behind in ninth place with a time of 2:10.33 minutes.
Freshman Chloe Berry and sophomore Amber Gore finished at 20th and 27th in the 1-mile race with times of 5:09.68 minutes and 5:14.34 minutes. The times moved Berry to seventh and Gore to eighth in the overall school women’s record for USC in the 1-mile event.
In the men’s events, junior Robert Ford finished the 800-meter event in 1:48.54 seconds to take fifth overall. Sophomores Nicolaus Jakowec and Trent Rule both set personal records in the men’s 1-mile event, finishing 20th and 23rd with times of 4:19.12 minutes and 4:21.62 minutes.
The Trojans will travel to Fayetteville, Ark. next for the Razorback Invitationals on Friday. The meet will be one of four invitational tournaments before the MPSF Indoor Championships and the NCAA Indoor Championships in March.

The normal order has been restored for college athletics in Los Angeles. USC football and UCLA basketball are back to their respective heights. USC is once again winning Rose Bowls with the best quarterback in college football leading the charge, while UCLA basketball is picking up marquee recruits and headlining a deep Pac-12 conference. 
While the Trojans’ football resurgence has been enjoyable, it is also painful that USC’s triumphant 3-0 record against the Bruins last season when facing off on the hardwood was probably an anomaly. It is not that USC’s basketball team isn’t good — head coach Andy Enfield has built a competent program. Unfortunately, UCLA just has one of the best offenses in college basketball in a long time.
Notwithstanding the Bruins’ loss to Arizona on Saturday, UCLA’s offense is inarguably a thing of beauty that has yet to really be stymied. On Wednesday, the Trojans will get their first crack at knocking off the Bruins.
The best chance USC has of beating UCLA is disrupting freshman Lonzo Ball’s rhythm. This has been a tall task thus far this season, but USC might have one of the few defenders athletic and strong enough to make it happen. Freshman guard De’Anthony Melton has proven to be a defensive wunderkind, and his long frame coupled with elite athleticism and strength gives him the chance to flummox Ball.
In the Trojan’s loss to Arizona last week, Melton was the only defender who seemingly bothered Wildcat freshman Lauri Maurkatenen. Even though Melton — at 6-foot-4 — gave up eight inches, on the few possessions they were matched up he was able to frustrate the stalwart from Arizona and force him into bad shots and questionable decisions.
Melton is already USC’s best on-ball defender since Marcus Simmons at the end of the Tim Floyd era. Offensively, he is leaps and bounds better than Simmons, but he still needs to make further strides on that side of the court in terms of consistent shooting and better ball handling with his weak hand. 
To beat the Bruins, the Trojans need a lot things to go right. Chief among them is Melton locking up Ball. They don’t need him to match Ball point-for-point or play-for-play – the Trojans have other offensive weapons to help potentially counteract the UCLA assault from deep. They just need the Melton who, so far this season, has been one of the best defenders in the Pac-12.
Outside of Melton, the Trojans do need those offensive weapons to come out clicking. In order to compete with UCLA, USC will need many of its shooters to rise out of their prolonged slumps. Without proper floor spacing, USC’s half court offense struggles to routinely score. As of late, the offense has had this exact problem. Without sophomore Bennie Boatwright, the Trojans’ only dependable 3-point shooter is Jonah Mathews, who is still adjusting to the college game. Though junior guards Elijah Stewart and Jordan McLaughlin can hit the occasional outside shot and catch fire, they are not consistent threats from beyond the arc. This is why USC has been inept offensively against the elite tier of the Pac-12 conference.
With the exception of the final 10 minutes of the Arizona game, USC’s offense has been abysmal against the best Pac-12 teams. UCLA, along with Oregon, Utah and Arizona, are a class above the Trojans right now. Maybe that will change when Boatwright returns from injury, and the Trojans can run the offense the way Enfield envisioned it at the start of the season.
For now, the Trojans are a talented team that takes care of business against the foes they are supposed to beat. Poor shooting and offensive execution has prevented them from taking the leap to excellence within the Pac-12. Maybe the Trojans come out on Wednesday with the same hot streak they ended the Arizona game with and score enough to beat UCLA. They will need some of their streak shooters to perform in addition to Melton having the defensive performance of his young career. UCLA basketball is unfortunately back, but USC does have the talent to play the role of spoiler. 
It’s not as sweet as the superiority the Trojans had last year, but any rivalry win would be welcome.

Photo courtesy of Jocelyn KimIt’s all in the game · USC hosted the second annual Global Game Jam, with participants programming, designing and writing art and music for products such as robots, video games and board games.
From Friday to Sunday, the second floor of the USC School of Cinematic Arts was transformed into a gaming central for the annual Global Game Jam. Creators and programmers were sprawled all around, working together or independently on their games.
 GGJ is a three-day international gaming event. It was started in 2009 with about 50 “jam sites.” This year, there were over 702 sites and 36,000 gamers participating in this program. USC has participated in GGJ since at least 2013 through the student run organization MEGA: Makers of Entertaining Games Association.
 The event kicked off on Friday evening with a livestream that revealed this year’s secret theme — waves — and a speech by MEGA president Manolo Rosenberg to the 200 participants. Afterward, the two days of programming, designing and writing with art and music creation commenced. Participants created a wide variety of games, ranging from video games to robotics to traditional card and board games.
 “It’s incredible watching what people can make in 48 hours,” Rosenberg said.
 Rosenberg, a junior majoring in Interactive Entertainment major, has participated in Global Game Jams since his freshman year and has risen to be one of the main organizers of the event.
 “So many different people come to the jams,” he said. “GGJ is about skill sharing, networking and forging friendships, regardless of how people identify.”
 Rosenberg recounts a year when he watched his family from Lebanon create games and participate in another GGJ from across the ocean.
 “People all over the world make something, no matter what the political climate. It’s really reassuring that people are continuing to create art,” he said.
 The event is open to anyone is the L.A. area, and USC hosts one of the largest sessions in the country, with alumni bringing it to other parts of California as well. Children and their parents, students from neighboring schools and industry individuals are invited to attend and partake in GGJ. Everyone is welcome, even those with no programming or gaming experience.
 “Game culture is one of community and mentorship,” said Lex Rhodes, the MEGA Vice President. “Gaming and video game design education is new so a lot is learned from skill sharing or self teaching.” 
 All participants are encouraged to ask for help and learn from each other, the industry members who attend and the student board throughout the course of the program.
 GGJ brought new technologies in for participants to explore. This year, virtual reality kits from Oculus were provided and the creators were encouraged to play around with them, learning to incorporate them into their games.
 Although game creation was the main activity of the event, Rosenberg emphasized the importance of taking breaks and enjoying time with others in the community during GGJ. In previous years, the group even did yoga to the landscape video game Proteus and other creative activities between the programming.
 Sunday evening, all the games were uploaded and became available to everyone to play. This open arcade session lasted for a few hours before the judging and prizes were awarded in four categories: aesthetics, best game play, best use of the theme and overall favorite.
 The judges of this year’s program were representatives from one of the main sponsors of the event — Survios — alongside other industry officials.
 But, Rosenberg maintains that though there was a competitive aspect to GGJ, it was not the main focus of the event.
 “Global Game Jam is about collaboration and encouraging creativity,” he said. “Once a year everyone gets to come together and make something amazing.”

The cherry blossom branches, paper lanterns and red envelopes rustled against the L.A. breeze on the opening day of Universal Studios Hollywood’s Lunar New Year exhibit. 
Coined as the entertainment capital of the world, the amusement park illustrates its inclusive mindset through the installments of a Lunar New Year exhibition open from Jan. 21 to Feb. 5, which celebrates the Asian holiday.
Though the official date for Lunar New Year is Jan. 28, the park created a two-week-long display to ensure visitors are able to experience a full cultural immersion.
The entrance to the park was characteristically preceded with an iconic Hollywood red carpet and the Chinese characters and English translation for “Happy Lunar New Year” were written above the exhibit’s entryway in a way that suggested a symbolic double meaning to the detail. 
The exhibition itself was strategically placed in the center plaza of the park intriguing the attention of guests streaming into the park with its bright red and gold banners. 
At the heart of Universal Plaza sits a dome-like cherry blossom installment, surrounded with 12 banners representing the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac. 
Each banner depicts the personalities, fortunes and birth years for guests to discover their zodiac sign; the activity was met with much interest, especially from young children and adults, as they observed what personality traits correlated with their signs.
The area was vividly adorned with red and yellow paper lanterns, the decorations serving as cultural symbols of positive luck and fertility in the coming new year. Guests are able to sit underneath an outside patio of lanterns to enjoy the festive sight and write their new year wishes on red cardstock paper next to the Wishing Trees. 
The Wishing Trees appeared to be a guest favorite; they were cherry blossom displays with clothespins, encouraging visitors to leave their written wishes for good luck. 
In addition, there were a multitude of photo opportunities with Universal Studios characters, such as Tigress and Po from Kung Fu Panda, Megatron from Transformers and Curious George. Most characters will be dressed in traditional Chinese garb to celebrate the festivities, enhancing the overall visitor experience. 
The most notable attraction of the Lunar New Year festivities was a monolithic Megatron. He gathered large crowds, especially among the foreign Mandarin-speaking visitors, who were fascinated by the character’s ability to speak their language. 
However, despite its Mandarin mannerisms, Megatron appeared out of place with the Lunar New Year exhibit. The figure’s voice, alongside the Transformers background music that accompanied it, overpowered the tranquil cherry blossom setting. 
To complete the cultural experience, the park brought a variety of limited food vendors serving Asian snacks, although at expensive prices. Many park foods became culturally themed, such as the Year of the Rooster donuts and cupcakes. Fortune cookies were also available for purchase, in addition to Sapporo beer, a Japanese lager beer and bottled green tea.

M. Night Shyamalan has had a mixed history in film. His career has seen many ups and downs, including commercial and critical hits (Signs and The Sixth Sense) as well as egregious missteps (The Last Airbender).
 After a few unsuccessful years, Shyamalan redeemed himself with the release of the 2015 film The Visit. The Visit, though hindered by its overly simplistic plot, featured a signature Shyamalan twist that fans have come to know and expect over the course of the writer and director’s career.
 With his most recent feature, Shymalan is back at the top of his game. Split’s intriguing premise features a great opportunity for James McAvoy. McAvoy portrays Kevin, an ill young man with Dissociative Identity Disorder. One of Kevin’s 24 alternate personalities kidnaps three girls and plans to brutally murder them as a sacrifice to the impending 24th personality.
 Split is a psychological thriller, but its pace is slow enough to allow audiences to think through and analyze the film’s more complex concepts. McAvoy is accompanied by the talents of Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey, Haley Lu Richardson as Claire and Jessica Sula as Marcia. 
Casey is a more quiet and reserved young girl, and she is forced into the kidnapping with the others after attending Claire’s birthday party in what she refers to as a “pity invite.” Once they end up in the situation, Casey takes charge in figuring out how to escape the clutches of the dangerous Kevin.
 Another interesting part of the film’s format is the inclusion of Kevin’s doctor. Dr. Karen Fletcher, played by Betty Buckley, seeks to understand not only Kevin’s issues, but the secrets behind DID. This arc does well to provide some explanation to how Kevin became this way, as well as alleviate the audience and move away from the film’s darker moments.
 Split succeeds in many areas. It is unique in that, while it is labeled as a psychological thriller, there are many elements of other genres within the film. 
There are moments of horror and even comedy: Shyamalan threads the needle between these genres and was able to assemble one of the best scripts of his career. His attention to detail is notable, with shots that are so visually powerful that no dialogue is needed to get the point across.
 Shyamalan’s incorporation of Philadelphia is an attentive addition to the film. He utilizes the location well and even incorporates it into some of the dialogue. 
This added authenticity makes the film seem more credible, though it is heavily based in the supernatural. The style of filming captures the essence of the city as well as the anxiety of each character, including many of Kevin’s personalities.
 Low budgets can sometimes burden films and prevent them from being as effective as they could. In this case, Shyamalan is able to forgo a large budget and focus on a more personal approach. 
Because his direction and script are so sharp, Shyamalan overcomes the low budget to produce a thrilling and incredibly compelling feature. Split is arguably the director’s best film, and it will be sure to impress even the biggest of Shyamalan skeptics.

Hopscotch, the world’s first mobile opera performance, tells a unique tale of lovers burdened with the difficulties of life.  Debuting at iconic Los Angeles sites since 2015, Hopscotch was performed in 24 cars that would travel through the city.
 There were eight scenic routes taken, each telling a different segment of the story. When a ticket was purchased, audience members would be given a specific address on their ticket and would begin the performance there. Every series of car rides told a radically different part of the character’s lives, and the audience could start anywhere in the storyline, thrown into the middle or working backwards from the end.
 Because of the non-linear narrative, the audience was forced to actively participate in the performance and piece together the story on its own. Hopscotch tells the heartbreaking and unique tale of many lovers tangled up together.
 “How do you know you’re in love with me, when there are so many you’s and so many me’s?” This is the question lovers Lucha and Jameson despair over as their relationship becomes more complicated.
 The characters struggle with their love for each other and question how substantial their love is when there are so many people in the universe similar to them. 
As time goes on, their love is not strong enough to bind them since both wish to pursue different paths of lives as the ones they are currently on turn aimless. During his research on headband transmitters, Jameson reaches a frenzied point and suffers a mental breakdown. Days, months and then years go by, yet Lucha never hears from him again.
 When Orlando, a friend of Lucha’s, returns from Paris, the two began dating. The new couple drive through the streets of the city and remark how much has changed due to the effect of time. 
They both agree that life is a series of questions. They grapple with mysteries of the universe and come to realize that some things will never be understood or have answers to them, neither the mysteries of the universe nor the mysteries in themselves.
 All 36 chapters of Hopscotch debuted for the first time ever in linear order at the Alfred Newman Recital Hall last Friday. It was a special evening lead by artistic director Yuval Sharon. Through Hopscotch, themes of companionship, displacement and fulfillment are developed and built on in the most interesting and unconventional ways.
 “A thousand streets lead into one great road, and no gate blocks your way,” a fortune-teller tells Lucha.
 The concert circulates around this enigmatic message that Lucha receives. Throughout the story, many characters battle the obstacles placed on the roads they travel. However by the end, Lucha finds herself headed down her own great road and the performance ends on this final note.
 The finale is so fitting as it ends on a perfect, balanced note. In a harmonious last song every performer walks slowly down the aisles. The eyes of the audience trails their every step. As the artists gather onstage for a grand finish, each sings to the hearts of all a story of love, determination and happiness.
 Sharon conveys it is through art that we can think about the intrinsic values and challenges of the universe. 
Art is a communal activity that brings together people to think about the world around them and their part in it. With art, people are able to both express themselves and celebrate life. 
The universe has many wonderful things to offer, despite the many mysteries it holds. Hopscotch clearly exemplifies this revelation in a beautiful, five-star worthy performance with the universal message to live freely and embrace what you cannot control.

In recent years, curvy body types have become overwhelmingly glorified, hypersexualized and ultimately, the hashtag-goals physique of Western entertainment. Nicki Minaj’s “Anaconda don’t want none unless you got buns, hun,” the “thick thighs save lives” mantra and the body-positive phenomenon that celebrates women of all shapes and sizes have arguably reshaped our cultural body standards for the better.
 When I was 16, at around the height of this “big beautiful women” trend (popularized by Drake), I felt out of place with society’s newfound curve obsession. As a relatively skinny, size 3 jean size Asian American girl, my body was spectacularly average: I had no visible thigh gap, B-cup breasts and appeared to be “moderately proportional,” in the words of my wise mother.
 I’m not complaining about that, although often, the body positivity movement feels like it has no room for average girls, who are pressured to have nothing to complain about.
 When a close male friend I checked out my legging-clad butt one day after class and casually remarked that I had a “flat ass,” I felt shame heat up my cheeks.
 I wiped away his comment into the recesses of my self-conscious thoughts, only to be tagged in a photo on Facebook a few weeks later that triggered an onslaught of insecurity from that point onwards.
 In the image, I was skipping away from the camera with a fellow friend; what appeared to be a candid moment captured in time led to a chain of insensitively playful comments about my “flat ass” among a circle of my predominantly male friends.
 To this day, I hold no grudge about this embarrassing chain of comments. The photo was even deleted after I privately messaged a friend.In retrospect, I even appreciated them for this. But for 16-year-old Terry, it was an emotional trigger of self-consciousness that resonated in my mind and continues to — even two years later.
 I started researching glute workouts online, even athletic tips and tricks to shrink my waist and enhance my nonexistent curves. I obsessively followed fitness “booty builders” on Instagram, imitating their workout habits and meal plans to figure out the fastest way to bulk my butt.
 I was stuck in an obsessively compulsive workout habit, one I couldn’t break myself out of until my first semester of college this year. I deadlifted and squatted three times a week, and I decisively exhausted my glutes, quads and hamstring muscles in order to rebuild them for a more prominent butt.
 And although my obsession with weightlifting was negatively perceived as masculine, especially by those in my family, the fact that I could squat a rack my weight or heavier created an internal sense of empowerment that catapulted my self-esteem past society’s subconscious body standards.
 As I molded my body through physical exercise, I realized that, ultimately, the only perception of my body that mattered was my own. It was an ironic realization, after almost two years of physical dedication to prove a point that mattered to no one but myself.
 The body positive movement, although it unintentionally tends to glorify either the curvy or skinny sides of the spectrum, should be portrayed as a personal movement that neither favors nor ignores any of the very diverse range of female body types. The movement should teach women that the best and healthiest bodies arise from self-acceptance, a state that we will all come to in our own unique ways.
 It shouldn’t just be feel-good moment that boots a women’s esteem, but a work in progress movement, where she continually strives to strengthen herself. For me, that state came about when I worked to become physically strong, and as a result, I built myself mentally in the process.

A study conducted by the USC Brain and Creativity Institute and Project Reason showed that human identity and emotion are directly tied to individuals’ political beliefs. When participants were presented with counterarguments to political views they felt especially strongly about, the insular cortex, the part of the brain that processes feelings, was particularly active. 
In an increasingly divisive political climate, it is important to think about how to have productive conversations with those with conflicting beliefs. The internet has become a breeding ground for hateful conversations and insults flung back and forth by people who are on different sides of the political spectrum, often to the detriment of marginalized Americans in particular. This prevents any productive conversation and reinforces stereotypes about liberals and conservatives. It also reflects the larger issues that a two-party system presents, especially at a national government level, within the different branches of government. It has become simply impossible for an issue to be non-political. Every event, message and response is lined with political agenda and rhetoric present to further a specific side’s political agenda. 
At the Women’s March in Los Angeles on Saturday,  several signs read something along the lines of “Make America Kind Again.” Most of the American public recognizes the animosity and malice that has overtaken political agendas, but cannot find a way to restore civility without threatening their own beliefs and identity. As the study shows, emotions and identity are essential facets of people’s political beliefs. For that reason, an attack on their beliefs translates to an attack on them. Empathy is the only tool that can be used to bridge the gaps that seem to be widening each day. 
Messages circulating the internet after the election present oversimplified narratives along the lines of “Dave voted for Trump, Jane voted for Hillary. Dave and Jane can still be friends.” In this election, more than ever before, American citizens felt that one political candidate invalidated their existence. Because of the unique nature of this election cycle, controversial statements about politicians’ beliefs felt like a betrayal and personal attack, from both candidates. This election, for many, was more personal than ever before, which accounts for the increased lack of empathy that citizens on both sides of the political spectrum displayed toward each other due to feelings of rage, isolation and vulnerability. 
Former President Barack Obama has previously suggested, “If you’re tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try talking with one of them in real life,” which is solid advice in theory, but could be ineffective in reality if individuals remain set on accepting only what reinforces their prior beliefs and fundamentally misunderstand the situations and experiences of Americans who are different from them. 
Empathy and unity must be found first in our political system, before politicians can expect citizens to adopt it individually. Healthcare must not be an issue of “Obama vs. Republicans” but one of ensuring millions of uninsured Americans are able to access healthcare. Immigration reform must be tackled with humanity and constructive conversations, not stark political beliefs based solely on party. Issues must become less “us versus them.” 
Citizens must understand that political views cannot be easily separated from self-identity. When millennials are criticized for being overly emotional and supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton are told to “get over it,” this translates to a personal attack, just as the reverse would have been true, had the election produced a different result. Having conversations alone cannot change the political climate that this election has created. A fundamental lack of empathy has been produced by the two-party system — something that individual citizens are not entirely to blame for. When people on different sides of the political spectrum have fundamentally different understandings of the truth, emotions undoubtedly factor into politics, as this study has made clear. 
There is no simple solution. This presidency and the election cycles that follow, we must pressure our elected officials to put in the effort to empathize with even the Americans who opposed them. When those in power begin to at least attempt to see eye to eye with one another, separating party attachments from political actions and discussions, then they can expect citizens to do the same. Once politicians demonstrate empathy for all their citizens, not just those on their side, the divisions in our country can begin to dissolve.

By now, you have probably seen videos or photos of a dewy-eyed then-Vice President Joe Biden receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from former President Barack Obama. Social media erupted with admiration for the emotional “bromance” between the president and vice president. This honor, indeed, marked a poignant end to Biden’s leadership as a new administration entered the White House. Despite Biden’s tearful departure from office, he has vowed to continue working on issues of public policy, particularly to convince President Donald Trump’s administration to prioritize sexual assault prevention. Though Biden is exceptionally prepared to take on new initiatives addressing sexual assault, he will undoubtedly need the support of universities such as USC.
“I’m going to be setting up a foundation that is going to devote the rest of my life to dealing with violence against women,” Biden said earlier this month.
Since 2014, the former vice president has spearheaded the White House’s work with the It’s On Us campaign, a nationwide effort to prevent sexual assault on college campuses. It’s On Us government studies have provided evidence of an epidemic in desperate need of attention. A 2016 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics revealed that approximately one in five women surveyed reported experiencing sexual assault since entering college. Biden came especially equipped to join this campaign. Twenty-two years ago he wrote the Violence Against Women Act. While in the White House, Biden, along with Obama, established the Council on Women and Girls and worked directly with the first-ever adviser on Violence Against Women. 
Last year, Biden specifically addressed university presidents. He called on universities to respond more effectively to reports of sexual assault and gather information through surveys to understand the issues plaguing campuses. 
“That message starts from the president on down at the university,” Biden said in a conversation with several university officials last August. “It really, really matters.”
The onus then falls on institutions, such as USC, to come alongside Biden and hold the Trump administration accountable in order to end sexual assault on college campuses. There are several practical steps that colleges and universities can take to prevent sexual assault. First, educational and prevention programming on campus is imperative. Programming and awareness campaigns that take on the issue of sexual assault could be the beginning of fostering a campus environment where gender equity and respect are core values. As an example of a successful program, last October, the USC Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services, in partnership with the Los Angeles Police Department, the Trojan Marketing Group and the Undergraduate Student Government, organized and hosted the It Ends Here run/walk to bring attention to sexual assault at USC. Second, colleges and universities should ensure that proper resources are made available to sexual assault survivors. Appropriate resources include materials explaining what steps to take immediately after a sexual assault and counseling and support services. 
The USC Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services is home to the Sexual Assault Resource Center, which thankfully provides access to such resources. Third, colleges and universities should appoint a Title IX coordinator. Title IX requires that every school have at least one member of the faculty or staff who is responsible for ensuring the school’s compliance with the law, yet many schools do not have a Title IX coordinator. USC, fortunately, does. However, many coordinators lack the resources they need in order to do their jobs. The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has released a list of resources Title IX coordinators should have. Faculty and staff can help by seeing that these resources get into the hands of as many coordinators as possible. 
USC has the potential to stand at the forefront of sexual assault prevention and has clearly shown that it has what it takes in order to do so. The University must continue the good work it has started by enrolling in more expansive future initiatives like those promoted by Biden. As a new administration has entered the White House — one whose attitude toward sexual assault prevention remains unclear — USC and other universities must seriously consider the role they have in influencing the attitudes of both their campus communities and the Trump administration toward the necessity of ending sexual assault.
