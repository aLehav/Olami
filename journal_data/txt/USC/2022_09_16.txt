Emblazoned on the walls of the brand new exhibition at the Fisher Museum, Louise Bourgeois reflects on the powerful nature of art as therapy. 
“Louise Bourgeois: What is the Shape of This Problem?” opened at the museum Sept. 6. The exhibit consists of 145 works borrowed from the Collections of Jordan D. Schnitzer and His Family Foundation and curated by Naomi Potter from the Esker Foundation. Though Louise Bourgeois is mainly recognized for her sculptural practice, this show focuses on different mediums including drawing, writing and printmaking.
Bourgeois, a French American artist, openly struggled with trauma and anxiety her entire life. Her work clearly points to her feelings of abandonment and loneliness and is a tangible product of her battle with her mental health. 
The introductory text to the exhibit features Bourgeois’ summary of her approach to art with her famous phrase, “Art is a guarantee of sanity.” For her, art was not a hobby or even an option; it was a necessity. Her work is what kept her alive.
The exhibition gets its name from a nine letterpress diptych series, which is on display in the museum’s right wing. In this specific piece and in many of her works, she includes autobiographical writing, often illustrating a woman under pressure and in crisis as a mother, daughter, wife or artist. Despite bleak themes, Bourgeois finds ways to weave in glimpses of optimism and faith, referencing repairing the sky and seeing rays of hope in her work on display at Fisher.
Eclectic in nature, Bourgeois’ canon includes prints, engravings, textiles, poems, sculptures and holographic images. Upon initial viewing, it almost seems impossible that all of this work could be the work of the same artist. However, there is one major theme that ties much of the exhibition together: the symbol of a spider. 
Throughout the 78 years of her career, Bourgeois repeatedly depicted the creature as a representation of maternal benevolent determination. 
“Deliberate, clever, patient, soothing, reasonable, dainty, subtle, indispensable, neat and as useful as a spider,” Bourgeois wrote. 
Bourgeois continues the exploration of the feminine psyche in her work, reimagining the female form with crafts traditionally delegated to women, including crochet, embroidery and sewing work. In this show, she elevates these art forms to represent not only femininity but also resilience and the beauty in making oneself whole again.
Throughout her series, “Crochet I-V,” located in the museum’s left wing, Bourgeois creates novel reliefs that are somewhere between sculpture and drawing. While at its core, every piece is a linear composition, each has its own texture due to the unique weaving, twisting and knotting. Bourgeois collaborated with Los Angeles-based print studio Mixografia Workshop for this special series.
One especially notable section of the show is the room in the very back of the gallery space, showcasing Bourgeois’ holographic work. The series features eight glass-plate holograms, made in the now defunct studio called C-Project in New York City. They are related to a series of sculptures she produced for the Tate Modern in London. Each work is incredibly dynamic and visually engaging, featuring a sense of depth not often seen in drawing and due to the nature of the medium. Within each piece, there is a detailed and borderline grotesque rendering of body parts, cages and empty chairs, creating an intimate look into Bourgeois’ feelings of isolation and disconnection to the world around her. While this section of the exhibition feels like a stark shift in tone from the rest of her work, it offers interesting insights into the artist’s mind and suffering.
In her work, Bourgeois treats her own anxieties and encourages the viewers to seek solace in their own way. Through this exhibit, Bourgeois demonstrates the courage behind the creative process, revealing her personal struggles or vulnerability. She tells a story about rebuilding her broken self in a way meant to inspire a communal sense of healing and restoration.
“Louise Bourgeois: What is the Shape of This Problem?” is on view now until Dec. 3.

Hi. I’m not usually here. If you turn the page a few times, that’s where I normally reside. I’m the sports editor here at Daily Trojan, but with Los Angeles finally seeing some rain last weekend, I figured I would talk about one of my favorite songs: “Box of Rain” by the Grateful Dead.
As I’ve gotten older, now at the ripe age of 21, I’ve realized more and more just how uncommon it is to find someone who has their shit together. I suppose there is a comfort in knowing that others are just as lost as I am, that everyone is navigating a pretty difficult world. 
My music taste has often been described as vanilla, as it’s mostly composed of “a bunch of old men from the ‘60s.” I play guitar and gravitate towards songs that I can learn to play. Sometimes I pick songs with lyrics that speak to me and drown myself in them, listening or playing them over and over again — “Visions of Johanna” by Bob Dylan is a tune I’m currently swimming in. 
When I’m sad or stressed out I’ll play songs that align with how I’m feeling. I listen to a lot of sad songs and I probably always will. Sometimes I wonder if I listened to more upbeat music if I would notice a change in my general mood — but that’s an experiment for another time. 
However, a song that does improve my mood, or at least makes me feel introspective, is “Box of Rain” by the Grateful Dead.
Jerry Garcia, the band’s lead singer, certainly knew pain. At five years old he watched his father drown in a fly fishing accident. When he was 19, Garcia was in a devastating car crash with his friend, who was killed instantly. Soon after Garcia formed the Grateful Dead, his mother drove off a cliff. 
Comparing life experiences isn’t a fair valuation of what emotions one is allowed to feel. Everyone can’t fully relate to anyone — you only know the experiences you’ve gone through and their effect on you. Jerry Garcia experienced some pretty horrific things, none of which I can relate to and all of which I hope I never can relate to. 
But bad shit happens to everyone, good shit happens to everyone and some people are lucky and experience more good shit and others are more emotionally mature than me and process the bad shit in impressively capable ways. 
The Grateful Dead brand of smiling Teddy bears and tie-dye shirts is associated with good vibes and positivity. But they’re a lot more than that. 
I once was in a shop in San Francisco and noticed that a Dead song was playing over the loudspeaker. I told the guy behind the counter that I liked the song and we talked for a bit about the band. He expressed his distaste for John Mayer, who began touring with some remaining members of the Grateful Dead, and I pretended that I agreed. 
As I left the shop, the man told me to “listen to the music.” I didn’t think much of it, other than it was a pretty cool line to drop as a wise old man. I hope I’m a wise old man one day. 
Months later, I was sitting in my room listening to music. I was alone in my apartment and sad about nothing in particular, which sometimes makes the sadness even worse. 
“Box of Rain” began to play and I remembered a funeral my dad had attended the summer before. The woman who passed loved the Dead and “Box of Rain” played at her funeral. My dad listened to it again, alone, on the car ride home. 
So, following the advice of the old man in San Francisco and the actions of my own old man, I listened to the music. 
I did not transcend or parade through my apartment shouting “eureka,” but I did take a step forward, if only a small one. 
In a life where everything feels so big, from Daily Trojan production to thinking about life after college to social interactions and the many misinterpretations that accompany them, “Box of Rain” helps contextualize the universal experience of existing on this planet. 
You should listen to the song. Maybe even pull the lyrics up and follow along — which is perhaps solely the recommendation of a former English major. As with all songs, how you respond to “Box of Rain” will likely vary from my micro-Eureka moment and I’d love to hear what you think. For now, I’ll share a bit about what the song means to me. 
“Box of Rain” opens with a description of a pleasant day on earth. The sun is shining, birds are flying about and “no rain is falling from a heavy sky.” The speaker then asks, in what is a repeated but slightly varied chorus: 
“What do you want me to do, to do for you to see you through?”
The earth, whom I believe to be the speaker in the song, has provided beauty and comfort for its inhabitants and is wondering, genuinely, what else it can do to ease the difficulties that accompany existence. 
The song continues to paint an image of the days that go by — with our quests for purpose and the possibility of finding it driving up through the “splintered sunlight” and “dead dreams.”
The climax of the song occurs when Jerry sings that “a box of rain will ease the pain and love will see you through.” From here the entire song switches. A different chord progression kicks in and the speaker hammers home the point they’ve been making for the entire song. 
“It’s just a box of rain.” The earth is literally that, a giant box of rain that we are all stuck on, whether or not you want to be. 
“I don’t know who put it there.” Does it matter? 
The final four bars are really what speaks to me. 
“It’s just a box of rain, or a ribbon for your hair. Such a long, long time to be gone and a short time to be there.” 
While life sucks a lot of the time and there is an endless list of things to get sad over, an endless list of problems that need solving, appreciating life is ultimately a choice. “Believe it if you need it, or leave it if you dare.” 
It’s not an easy mentality to consistently have. When shit hits the fan, it overpowers much of the good in life. But maybe try taking a walk, stepping into the Box of Rain where the sun is shining. Listen to the music of the birds and the sounds of cars speeding down the street. Watch life happen and appreciate it, because in the grand scheme of time your individual lived experience sure seems like a short time to be here.

Men’s tennis will gear up for the upcoming 55th Southern Intercollegiate Championship to be held in Athens, Georgia, starting Friday. The event, which has taken place each year since 1968, is one of the greatest and longest-running fall tournaments in college tennis history. 
The University of Georgia will host this invitation-only event with USC, UVA and Texas as the three teams who have accepted the invitation, with Georgia playing as the home team. The  Trojans and Texas Longhorns return to the Southern Intercollegiate Championship for the second year in a row. 
“We are hoping that the guys just go out, perform well and get some good experience under their belts, and hopefully win, that’s an added bonus,” said Head Coach Brett Masi. “It is the first event of the year and it’s kind of a test for them.”
Senior Stefan Dostanic, currently in his fourth season at USC, shot up the rankings to hail as number one in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association preseason rankings. Dostanic had a fantastic last season, winning 39 games, the most for a Trojan since 2010, with a winning percentage of 86.7%. Dostanic was named the 2022 Pac-12 Player of the Year, an ITA All-American in both singles and doubles and was selected as the Pac-12 Doubles Team of the Year along with graduate student Bradley Frye. Having lost just one dual match last season and finishing with a winning percentage of 94.4% — his maximum so far with USC — Dostanic is looking to achieve even higher this season.
Frye and University of Texas’ junior Micah Braswell might clash once again, as the latter defeated Frye with a score of 6-4, 6-4 last year in the same championship. Another interesting pairing will  be that of Dostanic and junior Siem Woldeab from Texas, who lost the match in two sets with a score of 7-5,7-5 in Dostanic’s favor last season.
The squad will also utilize the learnings from newly added volunteer assistant coach Bryce Pereira for the 2022-23 season. 
“The guys are gonna get a lot better coaching, and they are gonna be more equipped with the things they need to have,” said Masi. “Bryce is a great leader both on and off the court. Our squad will learn a great deal from him. [He] has a lot of knowledge and has played at a really high level at UCLA and we are excited to have him.”
Masi is looking forward to the hours USC has spent in practice paying off on the court. 
“We have been working on a few things with our games individually and hopefully, they can use those things when they go out to play the match and hopefully that comes with a W on top of it,” Masi said.
USC will play its first championship game on Friday against the Virginia Cavaliers at 10 a.m. ET. USC will face the Longhorns at 10 a.m. ET the following morning, closing the weekend with the match against the hosts at 10 a.m. ET. All the matches will be played at the University of Georgia, Athens’ Dan Magill Tennis Complex.

Women’s soccer outscored UC Irvine 3-2 yesterday at their first home game since Sept. 1. The Trojans entered the game hungry for a win after a draw at Nebraska last Sunday that ended the team’s three-game winning streak. 
“We needed something fresh and something new and I was really proud of how we started and the changes that we made,” said Head Coach Jane Alukonis in an interview with the Daily Trojan before the game. 
With 12 shots attempted, the Trojans gave their home crowd a dominant performance in the first half. It didn’t take long for USC to find its rhythm. With an assist from sophomore midfielder Helena Sampaio and junior midfielder Croix Bethune, junior defender Zoe Burns scored the game’s first goal within four minutes. 
According to Burns, the Trojans are “looking to dominate the Pac-12,” and the team’s performance today shows they are on the right track to do so. 
Almost six minutes after her first goal, Burns assisted sophomore midfielder Simi Awujo. Following in their lead, sophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer scored off a rebounded header from the opposing team in an impressive goal of her own. The Trojans’ skillful scoring spree left them with a 3-0 lead by halftime. 
At the start of the second half, UC Irvine was looking to get on the scoreboard and answered with a goal from sophomore forward Sophie Gillies in the 50th minute, making the game 3-1. 
A penalty kick was awarded to sophomore forward Simone Jackson, but the Trojans’ chance to extend their lead was blocked by redshirt junior goalkeeper Glo Hinojosa as she saved the shot in the 67th minute.
A newfound attack from the Anteaters earned them a second goal by freshman midfielder Emilie Castagna in the 82nd minute of play. Suddenly, the Trojans’ 3-0 lead diminished and a win hung in the balance of the remaining eight minutes of play. 
“Game management is super important because in games like this, everyone gets super anxious,” Alukonis said. 
With less than 10 minutes on the clock, the Anteaters looked for an equalizer that never came. In the second half, the Trojans “took the foot off the pedal a little bit,” and while this did not cost them the game, it will be a “lesson learned from today,” Alukonis said.
Relentlessly battling for the win under the excessive heat of the Southern California sun proved the physical and mental strength of the Trojans. Despite UC Irvine’s strong second half, the Trojans’ team unity was on display throughout the game.
“When they come back a bit, you always go back to your team mentality and just remembering that the confidence you have in each other is always gonna be what you rely on,” Burns said, stressing the importance of being able to “look at each other and understand that we are going to be fine.”
Thursday’s game was the Trojans’ last non-conference game as the Pac-12 season is set to begin next week. As for what to expect from the team throughout the rest of the season, Alukonis said USC women’s soccer is looking “to be as dangerous as we can be.” 
The Trojans look to build on this win next Friday at 2 p.m. against Stanford at Soni McAllister Field.

It’s Friday, which means it’s time for another edition of nobody’s (shoutout dad) favorite sports column. When I heard the Cleveland Cavaliers were trading players for the Utah Jazz’s Donovan Mitchell, I knew I had to write this column with the most committed Cleveland sports fan I know. Jack Hallinan, welcome to Coast to Coast. 
Did the Jazz get enough?
Jack Hallinan: The Jazz didn’t trade Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell to turn around and compete immediately; their goal was to accumulate draft capital and begin a rebuild. Between the two trades — Gobert to Minnesota, Mitchell to Cleveland — the Jazz now have an additional seven first-round draft picks and a slew of young players who could develop into decent role players. You can go back and forth as to whether or not the Jazz received “enough” to dump their two all-stars, but they undoubtedly accomplished their goal — to clean house. 
Yoav Gillath: The Utah Jazz brought back a pretty hefty haul for the 3-time All-Star out of Louisville. It’s not often you get a chance to trade a budding superstar entering his prime, and they certainly made the most of it. The picks will go a long way in jumpstarting the rebuild in Salt Lake City, but to me, this trade’s value rests on the shoulders of the young guns moving out West. Can rookie shooting guard Ochai Agbaji continue the development that saw him go from 3-star recruit to All-American at Kansas? If Agbaji explodes and combo guard Collin Sexton can recapture the form that saw him average 24.3 points per game in 20-21, the sky’s the limit in Utah.
Where do you see these teams in five years?
JH: While Mitchell will provide Cleveland with serious firepower, the path to success in the Eastern Conference is challenging. As long as the Celtics have Jayson Tatum, the Bucks have Giannis Antetokounmpo, and the 76ers have Joel Embiid, fellow conference contenders will remain relevant. Not to mention the Atlanta Hawks, who acquired Dejounte Murray over the offseason to set up a new all-star backcourt of their own. That being said, the Cavs have the best young core in basketball. If Evan Mobley can develop his offense over the next couple of seasons, the Cavs will win the Eastern Conference at least once with Mitchell on the team. For the Jazz, though, tanking is not as effective as it used to be after the NBA evened out the odds for the number one pick. Utah will hope to win the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes next June, but Jazz fans should understand that it’s no guarantee. They might have to settle for Scoot Henderson or Nick Smith Jr. Regardless of who they pick, the Jazz will at least return to being a fringe playoff team by 2027. 
YG: If all goes according to plan for the Utah Jazz, Victor Wembanyama should be donning the purple throwbacks in the 2027-28 season. The consensus number one prospect in next year’s draft, Wembanyama, is generational talent. No prospect has generated this much hype since Lebron James. On the other side of the country, the Cavaliers will be coming off back-to-back championships. It’s a bold prediction, I know, but no one will ever come back to read this column in five years anyways. Point guard Darius Garland and Donovan Mitchell will split Finals MVP honors, and all will be good in the Land until the salary cap salary caps.
Who’s looked the best at Eurobasket?
JH: NBA fans will recognize four of the top five scorers in points per game at Eurobasket: Giannis, Lauri Markannen, Luka Doncic, and Nikola Jokic. Except for Markannen, these guys are all household names — MVP candidates, unanimous top 10 players in the league. The fifth name on that list? Aleksandar Vezenkov, the Bulgarian dynamo who averaged 26.8 points (third overall) and 12.2 rebounds (first overall) in the tournament. Bulgaria didn’t make it out of the group stage, but on a team with no NBA players, the 6’9” power forward played at a level matched only by NBA greats for five games.
YG: Luka Doncic looks primed for an MVP-caliber season in the NBA after a sparkling Eurobasket run. While Slovenia fell short of a second consecutive crown after their 90-87 loss to Poland in the quarter-finals, Doncic had a couple of explosions in the tournament. A 47-point effort against Rudy Gobert’s France was the highlight of a strong run for the Slovenian superstar. In the end, a few nagging injuries limited Luka to 5-15 shooting in the team’s finale against the Poles. When he’s back to full health, watch out.

Beginning with heavy rain in June, Pakistan has experienced catastrophic flooding in addition to extreme heat waves. The floods have covered more than a third of the country in water, washing away crops and livestock and damaging more than a million homes. More than 1,400 people, including about 530 children, have died, and millions have been displaced. 
People living in Pakistan are used to a large monsoon season, but this year’s season has been the wettest on record. The extreme rainfall caused the Indus River, which runs throughout the entirety of the nation, to overflow. Balochistan, the largest province of the country, has seen rainfall that is 500% above average as of Aug. 30; this has damaged over 75% of its land. 
Although Pakistan contributed only 0.3% of the world’s warming emissions in 2020, it is one of the 10 nations most vulnerable to climate crises and will likely feel more effects with time. Adam Rose, a research professor at the USC Price School of Public Policy, spoke about the increasing likelihood of disasters like the flooding in Pakistan. 
“What was once a one in 100 year event in the U.S. is now becoming a once in 50 year, once in 20 year event, meaning they’re likely to occur five times as often,” Rose said. “That’s what Pakistan is likely to face because climate change isn’t going to stop and reverse itself; it’s actually going to keep getting stronger as we emit more greenhouse gasses, so we can expect more of these events in the coming years.” 
Although Rose predicts that Pakistan and the rest of the world will continue to face climate disasters more often in the future, he also believes that a disaster like the flooding in Pakistan, which has been well documented and widely reported on, has the potential to galvanize climate action from other nations.  
“There is concern, even if it didn’t happen to you, there’s concern about the plight of these 1,400 people that were killed, 500 of them being children,” he said. “That pulls on people’s heartstrings, and they start thinking about doing something. And then, you have events that are starting to hit home, like the fires in California, and more and more people are going to see every year.”
Abeerah Siddiqui, a junior majoring in environmental science and health, is one of many Pakistani and Pakistani American students within the USC community. She said that it has been encouraging to see that the rest of the world is aware of the situation in Pakistan. 
“It’s been great to see that people around the world are raising awareness about what’s going on,” Siddiqui said. “Especially because I think these days, people aren’t usually so aware of events that aren’t happening in their immediate vicinity. So it’s been great to see that people are organizing fundraisers, putting out information and that articles are being written.” 
Siddiqui also said she was glad to see awareness from the USC administration. President Carol Folt wrote in an Aug. 29 Instagram statement that she was “heartbroken watching the devastating humanitarian crisis and climate disaster unfolding in Pakistan,” and she urged impacted USC students, faculty and staff to reach out for help.
“It was nice to see that acknowledgement and that the University is aware of what’s happening,” Siddiqui said in response to Folt’s statement. 
The USC Pakistani Student Association, which Siddiqui is a part of, has been spreading awareness of the disaster and promoting various ways in which USC students can help those affected. Any students interested in helping out or donating can visit the USC PSA Instagram page, where they have posted links to three organizations that are providing aid in Pakistan: the Alkhidmat Foundation, Islamic Relief Worldwide and Akhuwat. 
“I think [donating is] one of the best ways to help out from all the way out here,” Siddiqui said. “Just providing this funding so that they can utilize them in the local communities to help rebuild or offer support in any way they can, because a lot of people have lost their homes, their livelihoods and they don’t have anywhere that they can go to.”

The Lincoln Riley era is off to a near-perfect start. The Trojans’ air raid offense proved more than effective against Rice University, blowing out the Owls 66-14 on opening weekend. To follow that up, USC defeated Pac-12 Conference rival Stanford 41-28 last Saturday. 
With 107 points in the team’s first two games, it’s no secret that offense is the name of the game for the Trojans. In fact, USC currently leads the entire NCAA Division I in yards per pass attempt (11.77).
Head Coach Lincoln Riley’s squad is now 2-0 and looking to do even more damage.
“Confidence wise, we feel like we are going to win every Saturday,” said sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams. “We go out there and execute, do our jobs, take our coaching and really apply it on Saturdays.”
Placed at No. 7 in the nation by the AP Poll, this week is the highest the cardinal and gold have been ranked since October 2017. Riley is pleased with the results so far but eager to see improvement from his team. 
“The positives I think are pretty obvious on all sides. I think the areas we have to get better [are] there’s too many mental mistakes,” Riley said after practice on Tuesday. “Whether it’s lack of focus or a lack of just complete trust in what we’re doing, that’s got to grow.”
Before USC enters College Football Playoff contention, the team will need to thrive in trap games — like the one it will play inside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum against Fresno State University on Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
The unranked Bulldogs are 1-1 on the season and are one year removed from a 10-3 campaign — highlighted by a win in the New Mexico Bowl against the University of Texas, El Paso.
Competing in the Mountain West Conference, Fresno State lacks the national exposure that other Power Five conference members might benefit from, but the team’s recent track record reveals the ability to win big games when given the opportunity.
Last season, the Bulldogs defeated No. 13 UCLA and No. 21 San Diego State University on the road and played a one-possession game against No. 11 University of Oregon, losing 24-31.
FSU was victim to a walk-off touchdown last week against Oregon State University. In the 32-35 loss, senior quarterback Jake Haener completed 29 of 45 passes for 360 yards and a touchdown.
Haener is currently working through his third season as a Bulldog since transferring from University of Washington. The 6-foot-1 signal caller enjoyed a career year in 2021, throwing for 4,096 yards, 33 touchdowns and 9 interceptions.
“It is as quality of an opponent from a passing game standpoint that I’ve seen in a while,” said defensive coordinator Alex Grinch. “[Haener] is a quarterback that can not only make the throw but extend plays. We say that he scrambles to throw, not scrambles to run.”
On the ground, the Bulldogs’ premier running back is redshirt senior Jordan Mims, who leads the team with 5 total touchdowns. Mims has 195 rushing yards on 36 attempts this season.
“Not many weaknesses. They’re just good everywhere. The quarterback’s really good, they’ve got some outstanding players,” Riley said when asked about Fresno State’s roster. “They’re very experienced, they know how to win. They obviously have a staff there of guys that are extremely experienced.”
Fresno State has their work cut out for them on defense, as sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams will enter Saturday with some of the most efficient passing numbers in college football. Williams is averaging 12 yards per pass attempt and currently holds the second-best quarterback rating in college football this season with a 96.5 mark.
The crown jewel of the USC offense has already created Heisman Trophy buzz with his 590 passing yards and 6 touchdowns through two games. The University of Oklahoma transfer is top three in the betting odds for the award, behind only Ohio State’s junior quarterback C.J. Stroud and Alabama junior quarterback Bryce Young.
As seen against Rice and Stanford, when Williams starts to click with his receivers, games quickly get out of reach for opponents.
The USC defense will have the opportunity to pressure FSU into issuing its first turnover of the season. The Trojans have intercepted opposing quarterbacks six times this season; totaling four from defensive backs and two from linebackers. Additionally, USC defensive backs have recovered two fumbles this season so far.
If there was a ‘game within the game’ to monitor on Saturday, it would be how the USC secondary fares against a more mature, conservative quarterback like Haener. Draft reports describe the senior as a smart passer who can make the right read, but also knows when to test the defense with a deep ball.
Even if there are half as many tip drills for the USC defense than there were up in Stanford, the secondary will have to stay much more disciplined in coverage if they want to slow the Bulldogs’ offense. Fresno State is known to run a much more horizontal offense, meaning that the team prioritizes high-percentage opportunities in the backfield or in the flat.
If four turnovers to none produced a 13-point margin of victory for USC last week, what will an even or negative turnover ratio look like?
Don’t be surprised if the team with the better ball security walks out of the Coliseum with a win.
“This is a real one,” Grinch said. “There’s no question that they have our attention.”

The U.S. News & World Report published their latest National University rankings on Sept. 12 to help prospective students and their families explore college options. USC is now ranked at No. 25, two places up compared to last year. 
First published in 1983, the U.S. News & World Report ranking has served as a weathervane for many students during their application process. USC tied with New York University, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor and University of Virginia on the 2022-2023 edition of the Best National University ranking at No. 25. 
In a response to a request from the Daily Trojan for an official statement, USC recognized that college rankings are one of the factors that students consider when navigating through their application lists. 
“Many national and international magazines publish college rankings these days. They are one of many considerations some people take into account when choosing a university,” the statement read. “However, the way these rankings are calculated changes frequently; the formula, algorithms, ‘peers’ being polled, and even the data used by the different companies rarely are made public. Therefore, we don’t comment on them.”
The U.S. News & World Report also published the ranking factors that were taken into consideration on Sept. 11, one day before the list was released. 
Graduation and retention rates remain the ranking’s most important factor, carrying 22% indicator weight in total. This is followed by undergraduate academic reputation and faculty resources, each carrying a 20% indicator weight. Other factors taken into account include financial resources per student, student selectivity, graduate indebtedness, graduation rate performance, social mobility and average alumni giving rate. 
USC’s average ranking in the past five years has been No. 24, steadily remaining a Top 30 university according to the U.S. News & World Report rankings. In that time, the highest ranking USC attained was No. 21 in 2017-2018, and the lowest was No. 27 in 2021-2022. 
Despite fluctuations in overall rankings for national universities, USC’s game design program stands out as No. 1 in the latest edition. Other notable rankings include the No. 8 spot in business programs and No. 9 in best colleges for veterans.

In the annual USC Rossier and Policy Analysis for California Education poll, around 2,000 California voters, parents and students ranked gun violence in public schools as their top concern for the fourth consecutive year. In the poll, voters most strongly supported policies that would increase reporting on potential threats and “harden” schools, such as requiring school administrators to report shooting threats, increasing the frequency of active shooter drills and installing metal detectors in schools.
The poll, titled “Assessing Voters’ and Parents’ Perspectives on Current Threats to Public Education,” surveyed voters on the urgency of eight issues threatening public education: gun violence, politicization of public education, controversy over curriculum, student learning and health, disenrollment, staffing shortages, college affordability and a lack of stable long-term funds. Fielded in July and published in August, the poll also examined the systemic equity gaps rooted in opportunity and access to education.
In previous years, when asked to measure issues on a scale from 1 (not important) to 10 (very important), voters rated reducing gun violence along an average of 8.47 to 8.63. This year, the average rating rose to 9.06.
Julie Marsh, co-author of the poll and professor of education at the Rossier School of Education, said that while the emphasis on reducing gun violence in schools is not new, the overwhelming support in this year’s poll is surprising. According to Marsh, it may be a result of recent shootings like the May shooting in Uvalde, Texas, or an increase in social media use.
“Certainly, social media has made it much easier to build public support for ideas to organize folks to share information,” Marsh said. “And so certainly, it’s an important political tool when it comes to advocating for policies and elevating the importance of policy-relevant topics.” 
Some students, like Raphael Deutsch, a doctoral candidate in the philosophy program studying classics, believe the support is justified — if not overdue. 
“As a Canadian, it used to feel shocking, but at this point, the kind of gun violence in American schools just seems par for the course in this country,” he said. 
American political culture, Deutsch believes, is fractured. “It kind of seems like collective madness to just treat it as a partisan issue when it shouldn’t be, and it’s framed as a partisan issue by the media,” he said. 
Jeimee Estrada-Miller, co-author of the poll and doctoral candidate at the Price School of Public Policy, spoke to the impacts of school shootings on youth. 
“In elementary school, I actually was in my classroom when there was a school shooting on campus,” she said. “A teacher was shot but fortunately didn’t pass away.”
Born and raised in South Central Los Angeles, Estrada-Miller attended public schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District for her K-12 education. The shooting at Figueroa Street Elementary School, she said, was life-defining. 
“The likelihood of being in a school shooting is low, but the reality is that school shootings have become such a strong presence in our life, that even the fear of it happening affects students,” she said.
While voters strongly supported hardening schools, Estrada-Miller said she believes lawmakers and constituents can do more to mitigate gun violence from a policy perspective.
“I would say there’s an entire disconnect between ‘What are some of the possible solutions for this’ versus what we can actually enact and what schools can do, other than have more shooting drills or completely put fences around them.” 
The first step, she said, is for those who are eligible to vote to do so. 
“Why we actually have a strong gun culture in America is because people who are supportive of the right to be armed are showing up to protect that right and loosen protection against guns,” Estrada-Miller said. “And they’re showing up publicly.” 
If people don’t exercise their right to political expression continuously, she said, public policy cannot accurately reflect public opinion. 
“It’s a classic policy process where there’s some sort of crisis that elevates the tension,” Marsh said. “You have to somehow find a way to sustain that attention, and the sense of urgency because that sense of urgency goes away.” 
Marsh credits President Joe Biden’s recent loan forgiveness policy as an example of the successful implementation of a policy which had sustained support. 
“It took partnership, and it took a lot of energy, time and investment on the part of a large number of individuals and organizations around the country to make that happen,” Marsh said.  
Upon observing the passion spurring USC students and the younger generations, Marsh said she is optimistic for the future of gun violence policy.
“The students who survived these horrible shootings, and the activism that we’ve needed and the success they’ve had in getting gun control laws, to me, suggests a lot of hope for the next generation,” she said. 
Kimberly Carbajal, a USC alumna who graduated in 2022 with a degree in Cultural Anthropology, echoed Marsh’s sentiments and emphasized raising awareness through social media.
“I think society needs to keep talking about this and keep everyone informed,” she said. “Right now, social media is a big thing. We need to continue posting and reminding people that these events happened.”
What makes Gen Z different, Carbajal said, is their inclination to make their voices heard. 
“We don’t give up as easily. We speak up and we continue to fight,” Carbajal said.

Although USC boasts luxuries like Dulce, Cava and a Trader Joe’s within its parameters, it can be difficult to take full advantage of these outlets because of their restrictive hours. Both Target and Trader Joe’s close at 10 p.m., with nearly everything else in the USC Village closing sooner. The only restaurants that remain open past that time are Rock & Reilly’s, a restaurant-bar that may not exactly pertain well to younger students, Insomnia Cookies (which has no indoor dining) and Chinese Street Food, which, although open later than most, still closes at 1 a.m. 
The closest dining experiences that stay open extra late (or 24 hours) are the establishments that line Figueroa on the east side of campus. For those living in housing on the other side of USC, this entails a 15 to 20 minute walk or a Fryft (as long as it’s before 2 a.m.), and the best students are going to get is McDonald’s, Carl’s Jr. or Starbucks. 
There seems to be a disconnect between necessity and flamboyance. Even though it is undeniable that having a lululemon or Face Haus on campus can feel extremely luxurious, it begs the question: “Do we really need this?” For a college campus, there are much more practical industries — such as late-night food service — that could flourish if properly placed. 
According to a study conducted by TIME Magazine on sleep patterns and studying in college students, the average college student goes to bed at 2 a.m. This study didn’t go as far as to detail sleeping habits during midterms and finals, a time when sleep is sometimes the last thought on students’ minds. 
MBB Management, a franchise consulting firm, explains that “Hungry college students who are looking for quick and affordable meals make ideal customers for quick-serve food franchises,” and this shouldn’t come as a shock to anyone. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that the most popular age range for fast food consumption is 20-39 years old, with 44.9% of consumption falling in that age group on any given day. 
So, why are there no late-night eateries nearby? The answer may be a number of reasons.
The first possibility could be that USC does not want its students dining excessively at off-campus entities. If most restaurants close by 8 or 9 p.m. and the dining halls close at 10 p.m., students are left with using up their meal swipes to satiate their late night munchies — which might lead students to buy more expensive meal plans that allot them more opportunities to eat late.
Similarly, there may be an image problem and the careful selection of stores in order to attract a certain audience. We all know if there’s one thing the University cares about, it’s the school’s pristine image. But by limiting nightlife on campus, it pushes students to default to other less accessible alternatives. Walking to McDonald’s or El Huero at 1 a.m. isn’t the greatest option, but it’s all students can really do when they’re starving after a late night study sesh (not to say that those carne asada fries don’t hit the spot).
Improving college nightlife does not mean putting a night club in the Village. It just means giving students more areas to actually do their work outside of their cramped dorms. We might have Leavey Library but it’s not the most positively motivating area to work.  
Regardless, it can’t be denied that the school has continually ignored the apparent needs of its students, whether in terms of easy access to food via viable meal plans or having access to restaurants past 10 p.m. 
Looks like GrubHub and Leavey may be the only solution for USC night owls to survive.

Growing up, my mom taught me many lessons. Among them were confidence boosters, such as to keep kicking footballs with the boys or that I was intelligent and beautiful and could do anything I set my mind to. But in terms of how I engaged with the world, the idea to not engage with strangers was vehemently railed into me. This is rhetoric I’m sure many of us are familiar with. My sister and I would have our eyes glued to the screen watching a scare tactic DVD that I can still visualize now of being abducted, with the use of only the best colorists the film industry had to offer to emphasize stranger danger. Do not get into a stranger’s car, do not let strange people touch you and do not reveal anything about where you live, where you go to school or any information that would allow strange people to track you down. These were mantras I lived by. 
Thanks to this arsenal of knowledge and some fortunate luck, I beat child abduction. But since then, the landscape has completely changed to the point of being obliterated. We no longer fear our information being available to the public. In fact, it is simply an presumed that our data is public, that privacy is in the past and that nothing can be done about it. These technologies, in the name of supposedly making our lives easier, have come at the price of privacy. 
Come the years I first began drinking, I summoned Ubers — i.e. some strange people in strange cars — to pick me up after a few lukewarm Bud Lights.  Come senior year of high school, I found my freshman year roommate by scribing a sanitized elevator pitch of my hometown, interests and personality on a relatively public forum otherwise known as a college Facebook group. Then, finally, come freshman year of college, I revealed to anyone who Googles my name where I work, where I have worked and where I attend school — on LinkedIn. 
LinkedIn, a platform likely familiar to much of the USC community, is a social media platform for professionalism. On it, people list their job and educational experience for anyone possibly looking to hire them for an internship or a full time gig. It is a public resume, one that is often an expectation, and sometimes a requirement, to be hired nowadays. Come peak recruiting season, one’s LinkedIn feed is filled with people getting hired and beginning their careers. Some companies even require that you post once a job is secured, sending you a graphic to inform the masses  — however many of your connections, and if you’re a business major, it better be 500+. 
While one may think to check Instagram to see what someone is up to, LinkedIn truly reveals all. It is a public display of what we were told never to release on a public forum: age, sex and location. It doesn’t stop there. All you have ever done, where you have lived and studied and possibly even more are all public information on your LinkedIn profile — all for a website that is mainly a puff piece on one’s qualifications and work history. 
One might insist that you could simply not make an account and that it’s possible to still be hired without it. But the unfortunate reality is that, for many employers, it is an expectation at minimum and a requirement at maximum. Many jobs post openings on LinkedIn, do recruiting on LinkedIn and some inquire for a link to your profile on their application. Some job applications require you to  “Easy Apply” through one’s LinkedIn account. Unless one were connected to a job directly through unabashed nepotism without having to properly fight for the position, a LinkedIn profile is necessary in today’s career landscape. A simple resume won’t cut it.
On many other platforms, being public is a choice, one that a user consciously makes depending on what they want to get out of their activity on the site. But, unless privy to the privilege of a promised line of work, LinkedIn is necessary. 
When looking back on the early 2000s during the early rise of the Internet, we treated interaction with strangers and revealing information publicly with a paranoia that neared hysteria. Now, a few decades into the Internet age, we have turned against that fear and have forgotten how important privacy was to us in the name of competition and career advancement. With some platforms, our position on privacy is one of our choosing, but with LinkedIn, the most revelatory of all, we are left with no choice. 
This phenomenon transcends LinkedIn. As aforementioned, these services that make our lives easier come at the cost of our personal privacy. But the reality is that these services rooted in information saving and location tracking dominate our world and are inescapable albeit for the uber wealthy — those who can afford a private car service or have people to do things for them and who have the resources to control those around them. That is not the reality for the common man. Our digitally connected world has brought upon the death of privacy in the name of requiring publicity for everything from your ride home to your future employer. 
It seems as though we have sold our privacy for convenience and a chance at success. But, like with any deal you make with the devil, you have to ask yourself: Is it worth it?
