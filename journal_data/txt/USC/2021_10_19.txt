Miuccia Prada’s latest collection for Miu Miu’s Ready to Wear 2022 collection was a hit. The short skirts, slouched button-downs, loose ties and muted khakis emulate an action figure, badass vibe that would make anyone turn back for a second look. The sheer calf socks with chunky loafers even being on par with the mother brand, Prada.
One thing that was impossible to ignore, however, was how drastically different physical coverage was throughout the show. Some models exuded the laid-back, effortless look of cool schoolboys, while other girls were sporting ultra short skirts and super cropped button-downs and sweaters. But it made me feel a little uneasy.
Now, I’m not placing the blame on Ms. Miuccia Prada herself — if you are reading this by chance, I would give you an arm and a leg. Her RTW collection was about breaking barriers and breaking fashion norms by playing with hemlines and silhouettes. I loved the ‘cool girl’ vibe Miu Miu gave off throughout the entire show — the winding catwalk, the sultry sheer socks, muted colors and the evident homage to the Y2K trend of Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie-esque mini skirts. The neckties flirted with the idea of androgyny and genderless clothing that has been getting more spotlight in the fashion world. 
But at the same time, I can’t help but tie this to the way schoolgirls have historically been sexualized.
This overt sexualization of schoolgirls is not solely in the United States — it is a worldwide phenomenon. This is largely due to how schoolgirls and their dynamics are shown in mass forms of media. In pop culture, a myriad of examples of student-teacher affairs exist in shows such as the U.S.’s “Pretty Little Liars” and Thailand’s “Girl From Nowhere,” and comedies such as Adam Sandler’s “That’s My Boy.” It is even prevalent in books like Vladimir Nabokov’s “Lolita” and Japanese Anime (especially in the pornographic genre of ‘hentai’) as well as music videos such as Britney Spears’ 2009 music video hit, “Hit Me Baby One More Time.” 
But mostly, a large reason for this sick and pedophilic fetishization of women’s education is due to the porn industry. Porn already represents a false fantasy of what sex is and how sex can be, but there are so many categories in porn that have to do with women and their education. Whether this is the same trope of students and teachers or schoolgirls using their bodies as a means to get out of trouble from authority figures, it continues to hurt the progress of equality in the education system and expresses implicit sexism. 
After fighting so long for gender equality in education, which still hasn’t been globally achieved, it is frustrating that a hidden price of women’s education is the sexualization of it. Yes, intelligence is often seen as an attractive trait, but my literal education and attendance at an institution as a woman should not be the reason for your arousal. This also means that female education is not an invitation to keep producing and upkeeping the fantasy of this pedophilic fetishization. 
Let me say it again: My education and ability to be educated are not reasons you should be turned on.
In the 21st century, I would expect that we would stop this creepy sexualization amidst all the Hollywood scandals exposing celebrities like R. Kelly, James Charles and Drake Bell being charged with child endangerment and child pornography possession. But it seems our society has a little more work to do. I would say better late than never, but I think this is more appropriate. Chop chop.

Whether you’re a decorated music critic or car radio listener, the last decade of chart toppers has brought one universally agreed upon sentiment: What we once knew as “pop music” is dead. In an ever-changing world — both musically and politically — the days of blindly optimistic, bubblegum-catchy Katy Perry and Carly Rae Jepsen earworms feel like distant memories from our current chart toppers. The world has simply evolved. In a time where any track has potential to go viral, pop music must evolve with the times to stay alive.
It’s during these fluctuations where rising stars such as Remi Wolf are utterly essential. Free-flowing, genreless and inexplicably catchy, sonic innovators such as Wolf have risen from the ashes of their predecessors to create a new sound that completely embodies the new generation. Wolf’s debut album, “Juno,” epitomizes this reckoning: Colorful, explosive and mind-blowingly creative.
“Juno” kicks off with the funky, crunchy synth-heavy “Liquor Store,” which was released earlier this year as the album’s debut single. Much like Wolf’s previous discography, it’s immediately evident the USC Thornton School of Music alumna boasts a unique ability to work cross-functionally with genres to create distinctive sonic aesthetics. The edgy funk synths, multilayered sing-yelling and hints of ‘90s hip hop drum beats create an anthem that makes you feel like a model strutting down the street on their off-day.
Wolf’s unpredictability throughout her album stuns, delights and switches up on audiences quickly and deviously. In tracks like “Guerrilla,” she’ll slow down momentarily for a beat breakdown before exploding into one more refrain about the “East side guys” who “bring the thunder.” In “Grumpy Old Man,” she switches her voice from a cooled, relaxed speak-singing to a Lana Del Rey-esque dramatic tone to a full-on country accent. Listeners will also delight in songs such as “Volkiano,” where she’ll momentarily break for a plucking-strings solo before she launches into a darkly synthesized, Weeknd-esque bridge where she begs for an ex to get out of her head.
Where Wolf shines is in her ability to capture the voice of Gen-Z: lyrically tackling serious issues, such as mental health, while creating upbeat, cool art that allows the pain to be viewed through the lens of her lighthearted, nihilistic sense of humor. 
Songs like “Anthony Kiedis” discuss how “Everything’s shut down / and I don’t have friends anymore” and “I don’t have feelings.” However, the song itself feels like it’s poking fun at the direness of her situation, as it’s titled after the lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and played a guillotine chopping sound effect after a lyric referencing her rising fame feeling like the French death machine. 
“Front Tooth” touches upon similar lyrical themes, as she talks about how fame doesn’t “feel like it’s supposed to,” often feeling instead like “a Conor McGregor fight / Kicking out [her] front tooth.” It’s funny, sad and innovatively executed.
Another notable track was “Quiet On Set,” a single released ahead of the album debut. This song is simply Wolf in three minutes: It’s colorful, hilarious, wild and brimming with personality. The track’s thematic content is full of delectably catchy ad-libs and hilarious lyrics such as “Should I Postmates Chuck-E-Cheese? / Wait, ain’t no Chuck-E-Cheese in Los Feliz!”. This is Wolf in a nutshell, and she’s the effing moment.
Sonically, it’s no secret Wolf has struck genius in her ability to both blend and bend genres. Her album is full of simple but effective creative choices: thematically layering crunchy guitar synths, lining up the instrumental beat of “Buttermilk” perfectly with her rhythmic vocal chanting and even putting cartoon-character sound effects such as antique digital “boings” and “clicks” in “Guerrilla.” While some may criticize instrumental repetitiveness, others could just as validly argue these choices create a certain cohesion throughout the body of work.
Vocally, she has mastered a tried-and-true technique for pop and R&B music: Earworm vocables. “Anthony Kiedis,” for example, vocally juxtaposes old-school R&B “oo-wee-oo” themes with early 2010s “na-na-na’s” to create a sound that simultaneously feels eerily familiar yet innovative in its combination. “Sexy Villain” shares a similar theme, as she sings “Tip tip tippy toe’s” throughout sonic interludes to create a chiming ring to the deep synths. There remains a quintessential child-like wonder and playfulness in Wolf’s creative style, and it pays off. 
This is not to say that “Juno” doesn’t share celebratory vulnerable moments. “Sally,” the album’s 10th track, feels like a refreshing blast of celestial light. With a country-esque steel guitar intro, Wolf’s vocals effortlessly and entrancingly above the emotional instrumentals. Lyrically, she confesses to writing songs about a muse (presumably Sally) who’s “Hot like Arizona / Drinking mad Corona.” 
Meanwhile, “Volkiano” and “Buzz Me In” boast of the most poignant, heart-wrenching lyrics in the whole album. Wolf sings, “And I apologize if I take it too far / But I get bored wearing all of these scars” and “My tears taste like you / Taste just like salt and wine,” respectively. Underneath Wolf’s mischief lingers truth about the human experience — despair, heartbreak and loneliness as a young person growing up in troubling times.
Put simply, Wolf is a mad scientist. But the successful results of her experiments are absolutely by no mistake. In her debut album, the 25-year-old music enchantress was able to take the fundamentals of her pop, R&B and hip-hop predecessors, throw it into a magical blender with unicorn vomit-sparkles, pandemic depression and sick fuzzy bucket hats and spit out a perfect formula for whimsical, joyful, heartbreaking and vibrant music. 
Remi Wolf is a trailblazer in the pop music world who’s creating her personal unique genre in her own right. If it wasn’t already clear, the release of “Juno” only confirms: Her unstoppable meteoric rise to stardom has only begun.

Holding photos of police violence victims and chanting “no more money for Duterte’s crimes,” more than 30 USC students and community members gathered Monday night to honor victims of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs and to endorse the passage of the Philippine Human Rights Act. 
The event was organized by USC Troy Philippines, the Philippine Human Rights Act District 37 Campaign, Anakbayan Los Angeles, Kabataan Alliance and Migrante Los Angeles. It had speeches, a musical performance, an interfaith prayer and call to action in support of Pilipino human rights. 
Speakers reflected on the loss of the victims and expressed support for the Philippine Human Rights Act. The act would end the United States’ funding to the Philippine army and police, which human rights activist groups say Duterte has weaponized against Philippine citizens, especially the urban poor, until certain human rights measures are met. The U.S. government provided over $550 million of military assistance to the Philippines between 2016 and 2019, according to the Stratbase ADR Institute. 
Troy Philippines president Johannah Suegay, a senior majoring in communication, spoke to the crowd about the history of Pilipino activism and the importance of the PHRA. 
“USC Troy Philippines and countless other Pilipino youth organizations exist today to embody this long-lasting legacy of youth activism,” Suegay said. “Our organizations were created to be active, to be political and to fight for change. The Pilipino youth has always demanded for more — demanded better for our communities, our country and our future. As an organization, we endorse the Philippine Human Rights Act and urge U.S. Representative Karen Bass of District 37 here in Los Angeles to do the same.”
Alex Montances, a volunteer with the Philippine Human Rights District 37 Campaign team and an administrative assistant at the Dornsife USC Wrigley Institute, emphasized the movement’s importance, asserting that money sent to the Philippine government to expand its police power would be better used helping local communities. 
“We don’t want our U.S. tax dollars to be used for violence or hurting people in the Philippines,” Montances said. “It’s better for healthcare education or even serving our communities here.”
When it was introduced in the last Congressional session, the Philippine Human Rights Act amassed several cosponsors. California’s 37th District congresswoman Karen Bass was not among them. 
Bass, whose district encompasses much of the area southwest of Downtown Los Angeles, including USC’s University Park campus, sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and chairs a subcommittee on global human rights. She’s now a candidate in the L.A. mayoral race, but activists such as Montances are continuing their work to obtain her support for the PHRA. 
“Whether she runs for mayor or not, we’re part of her constituency,” Montances said. “We are from Los Angeles. Even Karen Bass is actually a USC [alumna]. For us, we [want her to] listen to the community.”
Adilene Klink, a freshman majoring in psychology, read the names and told the stories of victims while the crowd lit candles to honor the lives lost. 
“Even though it is such a sad topic to be talking about and speaking about, I felt I was able to actually find a connection to these names not [by] personally knowing them, but [by] being able to read their stories,” Klink said. “These were living people, just like you and me, who were just killed by the [Duterte] administration and the deaths could have been avoidable… They were taken too soon.” 
In addition to asking for Bass’ support, students stressed the need for USC to take actions in support of Pilipino human rights. 
“First of all, it’s Pilipino-American History Month. We’re trying to get the University to acknowledge that, or at least recognize that, on a larger scale,” Suegay said. “Hopefully by recognizing that and celebrating our history and our culture, we’re able to also bring [these issues] to light.”

Despite coming off an Elite Eight run, men’s basketball did not crack the top 25 of the preseason Associated Press poll. USC received 30 votes, enough to put it at No. 28 in the country behind Michigan State and Indiana; however, the Trojans are not officially ranked. 
The top of the poll is littered with familiar foes, including No. 1 Gonzaga, No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Kansas and No. 13 Oregon. USC faced each of these teams, besides UCLA, in the NCAA Tournament in March, falling to the eventual runner-up Gonzaga in the Elite Eight. 
The Trojans beat the Bruins in both of their matchups last year, one of which was due to a buzzer-beater by then-graduate student guard Tahj Eaddy and the other a blowout win. They also upset Kansas in the round of 32 of the NCAA Tournament with a massive 34-point win. The Trojans trampled the Ducks in the Sweet 16. The only team in the top three of the poll that didn’t lose to USC last season is No. 1 Gonzaga. 
After losing star center Evan Mobley left to the NBA draft, USC will have to prove itself to the media. Most of the players from last year’s roster are returning, and Memphis transfer junior guard Boogie Ellis will be a key addition. UCLA and Kansas have a corps of returning players from last season, which could explain why the media believes they should top the rankings despite losing to USC last season. 
Being unranked at the beginning of the season is not a new experience for USC. Last season, the Trojans started the year unranked and were able to build a reputation throughout the season that gave them the sixth seed in the NCAA Tournament. The team will have the opportunity to prove itself in the regular season against No. 2 UCLA Feb. 12 and March 5 as well as against No. 13 Oregon Jan. 15 and Feb. 26.

On the Senate floor Sept. 22, Franita Tolson, along with four other witnesses, sat in front of a subcommittee which included Texas Sen. Ted Cruz entitled “Restoring the Voting Rights Act: Combating Discriminatory Abuses.” When Cruz asked for Tolson’s opinion about voter ID restriction laws throughout the country, Tolson replied confidently. 
“What voter ID laws are racist?” Cruz asked Tolson. 
“Apologies, Mr. Cruz. Your state of Texas, perhaps,” Tolson responded. 
Testifying in front of prominent political figures is not new for Tolson, the Vice Dean of the Gould School of Law. In July, she testified twice before the House of Representatives about election laws, becoming a favored resource for the House and Senate. 
In her experience with the House of Representatives, Republican senators do not address witnesses very often, Tolson said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. When Cruz first addressed her, Tolson was eager to see a Republican senator was engaging in the discussion. 
“I actually thought it was a good thing because it shows a broader engagement with these issues and possibly a willingness to listen to a witness regardless of their view,” Tolson said. 
However, Tolson said the initial happiness wore off, turning into intense focus as Cruz started asking about specific voting ID laws. 
“No matter what his aim is, I’m here for one purpose only,” Tolson said. “That is to educate Congress on the need for new federal legislation.” 
After closely following the 2008 election, Tolson saw a career path as a lawyer with an expertise in voting rights. Originally from Chicago, Tolson attended Truman State University, majoring in history. She then attended law school at the University of Chicago to combine her passion for history with something “intellectually challenging” that would help increase voting access across the country.
“[The 2008 election] was probably the most exciting election in my lifetime,” she said. “But it also felt like there was a lot of work that needed to be done to make sure that communities of color could participate on the same level and in the same ways as voters in the majority.”
Tolson’s challenge to Cruz made national headlines. Andrew Guzman, Dean of Gould, was proud of the attention Tolson’s interaction with Cruz received, noting the importance for faculty to “speak their views loudly.”
“You don’t need to take a political position to believe that the rules around voting are important,” Guzman said. “We know this is true when you watch the fights that are going on over voting in our country right now, everybody knows they’re important, whatever views you have.”
Rebecca Brown, Trustees Chair at Gould, heard about Tolson’s work when Tolson first started in academia. Impressed by her earlier works, Brown played a role in convincing Tolson to come to USC as a professor. 
“I’ve always been proud to brag about the fact that I was the one who spotted the talent because she has really impressed us so much since I got her here to join us,” Brown said. 
Tolson has been Vice Dean of Gould since July 2019, navigating the campus shutdown from the  pandemic and the increased focus on racial justice issues due to nationwide protests. 
“She has not had an easy time to be in a position of leadership in her Vice Dean position,” Brown said. “And she has just handled it beautifully with wisdom and with grace, always with a smile and a good sense of humor.”
Tolson is currently working on a book titled “In Congress We Trust?” The book will highlight provisions of the constitution Congress can use to expand voting rights besides the commonly cited 14th and 15th amendments. Tolson’s inspiration for the work came after testifying before the House in 2019 about the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which aimed to establish a specific process for reviewing voting legislation changes throughout the country in order to decrease voter discrimination. 
“One of the things I realized in the course of that testimony is that a lot of times, members of Congress are just not aware of everything that they can do,” Tolson said. “They deal with a million different issues, all very different, so I realized they might not actually understand the full extent of their power over this issue.”
After her interaction with Cruz, Tolson hopes to maintain her voice in the election law space and to continue speaking with people who have political influence both at the national and state levels. 
“[I want to keep] talking to members of Congress and talking to elected officials about the importance of protecting the voting rights of minority communities, but also how this bleeds over into protecting everyone’s voting rights,” Tolson said. “Because when you care about the most vulnerable members of society that benefits everyone, it’s not just about that group.”

No. 3 USC, still reeling from its loss against No. 2 Cal, got another confidence booster with a 13-9 win Sunday against No. 5 Long Beach State.
The Trojans handled business with graduate student 2-meter Wyatt Barker, redshirt junior driver Ashworth Molthen and sophomore driver Carson Kranz all scoring hat tricks in the victory. The Beach had a 2-1 lead early in the second period, but just 24 seconds later USC rattled off four straight goals and never lost the lead again. 
Freshman 2-meter Luka Brnetic got the first goal of the game for the Trojans. USC was able to get the job done on Sunday even without having its top scorer, redshirt senior driver Jacob Mercep, notch a goal in the contest. 
“We were showing improvement,” said Head Coach Marko Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Long Beach is [a] very tough [opponent], we were getting ready for this game, and I’m very happy with the way the team performed.”
The game marked the Trojans’ 13th time scoring double-digit goals this season. The defense also put in a shift as senior goalie Nic Porter had 11 saves in the contest. This marks Porter’s 30th career double-digit save game for the Trojans, and his sixth this season. Porter is third in the MPSF in saves per game.
The Beach have been formidable this year, as they held a 16-4 record with wins against top teams such as No. 6 UCSB and No. 8 UC Davis before the game. USC’s defense swarmed Long Beach State the entire game, creating difficult offensive circumstances for the Beach. Apart from a two-minute stretch in the third and at the very beginning of the game, the Trojans were able to prevent Long Beach State from scoring consecutive times throughout the game.
“We improved in some areas, and some areas need more improvement. We bounced back for example in our six on five power play conversions we were 50% this game … I’m very pleased with that ratio,” Pintaric said. “It’s a work in progress, but we worked hard this weekend.” 
With only three games left in the season, USC hopes to end on a strong note before heading into the MPSF championship and the NCAA tournament. After losing in the NCAA final last year to UCLA, it has been the Trojans’ goal to get back to that same spot and claim victory this time around. USC’s match against Stanford next week will be very important to its overall mindset and confidence for these very critical next few games, as the Trojans haven’t defeated the Cardinal since 2019.
“Long Beach was a very capable opponent, and that’s why we got ready for Long Beach like we are getting ready for Stanford, and for Santa Barbara next week and week after for UCLA. It’s always preparation,” Pintaric said. “You always have to play with the same frame of mind if you want to reach that consistency.”
USC visits Stanford at 1 p.m. Saturday in its second conference match of the season.

In an extensive study published January 2021, the Center for Juvenile Law & Policy at Loyola Marymount Law School presented 50 years of evidence of at least 18 deputy gangs within the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. With names such as the “Compton Executioners” and “Wayside Whities” and matching tattoos to go with them, these stories sound like urban myths meant to scare the community. 
However, they’re very much real and yet L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva continues to deny and downplay these secret subgroups’ existence within his department. 
In a video addressing deputy cliques, he said, “I have seen no evidence of three or more deputies engaging in criminal activity with a unifying symbol, whose primary purpose is to commit crime.”
In a press conference at the L.A. Hall of Justice Sept. 22, Villanueva stated that these subgroups have dissolved. “They’re retiring, they no longer exist” and the report “[was] not interested in the truth,” Villanueva said in response to external investigations such as the LMU study and the RAND Corporation’s report, which outlined the existence of these deputy gangs. 
“If a subgroup of any set of employees engages in misconduct, that is when I, as an employer, can intervene. [The RAND researchers claim] that we can just ban groups outright. Well, that is not constitutionally permissible,” Villanueva said.
Despite Villanueva’s denial, misconduct has occurred. Deputy gangs have been involved in at least 133 shootings in the past five years and have killed over 40 people — that we know of. What intervention has occurred? Where are the internal investigations? The disciplinary actions? A slap on the wrist and empty threats and reforms are not going to cut it. 
In regards to the “constitutionally permissible” part of his quote, Villanueva has the broad legal authority to shut down these groups as they exist within the LASD. 
In a memo obtained by the Los Angeles Times, county lawyers from the Office of County Counsel wrote, “Because a ban on subgroups is connected to employees’ conduct in their capacity as LASD personnel, not as private citizens, it likely does not implicate the First Amendment. Subgroups do not exist separate and apart from LASD employment. They are defined based on LASD stations, bureaus, or units, and their activities are intertwined with law enforcement functions.”
It’s not possible to stay in denial any longer. Multiple external investigations have revealed the existence of secret subgroups within the LASD that partake in “pervasive initiation rituals” and violent behavior. Furthermore, the L.A. County Civilian Oversight Commission fully recognizes these deputy gangs’ existences and “acknowledges it is a significant problem that requires a proactive and multifaceted response.” 
They even issued a subpoena to Villanueva to further discuss the actions he must take against deputy gangs, but the sheriff refused to attend. He called them “a kangaroo court” whose “entire role is to discredit the sheriff’s department.”
The only prominent action Villanueva, or any LASD leader, has taken is paying millions of dollars in settlements to hide the scandals of their subgroups. According to data from the L.A. County Counsel’s Office, L.A. County has paid a total of around $55 million in case settlements involving allegations of sheriff deputy gangs, with $21 million paid within the past 10 years, which is taxpayer money too. 
Villanueva has frequently described these subgroups as cliques and social groups. “The overwhelming majority of deputies who socialize with each other are no different than other social groups in military organizations, sports teams, college fraternities or even those that unite for a common cause,” Villanueva said.  
This analogy is ludicrous, but even if they were just fraternities that just engage in hazing, our best-case scenario, as the L.A. Times’ Editorial Board described, is a “secret and unofficial but armed and publicly paid law enforcement organization asserting its own sort of supervision, assignment and promotion, unaccountable to the official chain of command.” 
These aren’t unsubstantiated accusations or mere fraternities going haywire. These are real-life occurrences of secret, unofficial groups within L.A. County who use and encourage excessive force targeting communities of color while lacking any accountability whatsoever. 
To say our law enforcement system is flawed would be a grave understatement. It is broken and has been since its creation. The South developed the very first police forces to preserve slavery, and our modern-day law enforcement still maintains the 1700s slave patrol mentality. This is evident with deputy gangs. 
In an article with the L.A. Daily News, Sean Kennedy, the executive director at the Center of Juvenile Law & Policy, emphasized the need for internal investigations.
“They need to just release the info, and let various people and groups investigate,” Kennedy said. “If it’s just as some say, a harmless social group, then nothing will come of it. But the more startling allegations … that should concern us all.”
Outside of calling more public attention to this issue, the Times Editorial Board suggests voters demand the next sheriff candidates clearly set their positions on deputy subgroups so constituents can hold them accountable to their statements. With the primary sheriff elections only eight months away, we need a candidate that will uphold their word, enforce their reforms and shut down these subgroups — and it’s not Villanueva. 
Creating a positive attitude toward law enforcement is one of this country’s greatest problems, but abolishing deputy gangs is a critical place to start.

Ever since Rachel Green from “Friends” named her newborn baby Emma on that fateful day in 2002, classrooms across America have had to devise more and more clever ways of differentiating between the hoard of Emma variants that overpopulate the upcoming generation: Emma J., Little Emma, Emma With the Hot Tub, etc.
As a result of its long-standing popularity, the name is now regarded as a rather blank slate: something standard, predictable and rather vanilla. 
Is every Emma, then, condemned to a life of nothing special? Just how much does a person’s name predetermine their character or even their fate?
Well, one way of answering this question is through the lens of evolutionary subjectivity: Caveman vision.
When we meet a new person — let’s call them Sam — we instantly flip through a Rolodex of all the other Sam’s we’ve ever known: Dad’s old boss, horse girl from eighth-grade science class, the cousin who’s always in the midst of a messy divorce. All of these formative experiences combine into a series of expectations we then use to confront this new Sam.
In short, caveman vision heavily relies on stereotyping. 
This makes sense from a survivalist standpoint. If one snake bites, it isn’t far-fetched to assume others will too.
Some assumptions pop up consistently. Leonard Newman at Syracuse University asked 500 college students to rate 400 popular names. They tended to associate female names with lower levels of competence, while they associated male names with lower levels of warmth.
In that same vein, one study found that the same job application was rated more highly if it was labeled with a white-sounding name rather than a Black-sounding name.
While very depressing, it raises another question: What effect do these assumptions have on a person?
The answer to that question is a little more complex than caveman hubbub.
In 1954, psychologist Gustav Jahoda conducted research on the relationship between names and behavior. He discovered that Ashanti people believed that the weekday on which a person was born plays a significant role in determining who the child will become, with Monday-born boys becoming even-keeled and Wednesday-born boys becoming aggressive.
To test this superstition, Jahoda cross-referenced local juvenile court records to see if, in fact, more Wednesday-born men were predisposed to a life of crime. He found that the number of violent acts committed by boys born on Wednesday was much higher than could be explained away by chance.
This phenomenon has less to do with unlucky names and birthdates, and everything to do with the development of self-concept.
Self-concept is simply a collection of beliefs about oneself. It evolves as we do, and the messaging of others deeply affects it.
When we’re young, our parents’ messaging is the loudest. If they treat us like we’re good, we believe we are good. As we get older, we start valuing the messaging of other people, too: Friends, teachers, distant relatives, people on T.V., and soon enough our cup runneth over with external input. 
Like most things, that information hardens over time. The result is a rather concrete belief in oneself. We have analyzed and re-analyzed vast amounts of data over decades, and our conclusion is such: We are, in a general sense, in all actuality, basically good.
Put briefly: We and everyone around us unconsciously follow a script when it comes to names. That doesn’t mean free will doesn’t exist — that’s a debate for another week. It suggests that even from the moment we are born, suppositions swirl about our head, and we owe it to ourselves to sift through the mess and decide what’s worth keeping. After all, why would we ever leave it to the general public to determine our life’s purpose?
This is a pretty good argument against groupthink and an even better argument against silly nomenclature.
The name “North West” is funny in theory, but how does a name like that affect a child’s development of self-concept? Sure, she’s American-royalty-level rich, but if her name is the butt of a thousand jokes, it’s plausible to suspect she isn’t being taken seriously; her voice may be getting lost in all of the laughter, assumptions and personal digs.
Or maybe she loves her name and wouldn’t change it for the world. Only time will tell. It’s certainly got a lot more personality than Emma J., so she’s got that going for her.
Puritan preacher William Jenkyn once proclaimed to his congregation: “A good name is a thread tyed about the finger, to make us mindful of the errand we came into the world to do for our Master.”
That’s a little self-righteous, and he unironically used the word “Master,” so deduct extra points. For these reasons — and more — Kimya Dawson said it better.
“Joey never met a bike that he didn’t wanna ride
And I never met a Toby that I didn’t like
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended
Even if he didn’t I wouldn’t be offended.”
