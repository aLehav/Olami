Arianna Huffington, president and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post spoke at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center ballroom last night on her most recent of 15 books, The Sleep Revolution, as part of a Visions and Voices signature event celebrating the 10th anniversary of the program. Her new book uses her data and life experiences to discuss the cultural dismissal of sleep and offers tools needed to sleep properly using her own life experiences and data.
“The main takeaway [of the book] is that we have been living our lives under the delusion that we sacrifice sleep in order to be productive and achieve and improve what we are doing,” Huffington said. “Modern science — including a lot of the science here at USC — proves the exact opposite.”
Huffington believes that the culture is beginning to change, though, and that in a few years conference rooms will be replaced by napping rooms. As of now, she said, high-level executives and politicians are incorrectly stating that lack of sleep is the mark of success.
“People have been known to brag about how much sleep they get and see it as a ‘macho’ symbol and not recognizing that they are — in fact — sacrificing their health, their cognitive abilities, decision making and their happiness,” Huffington said.
Huffington said that her research relates the development of Alzheimer’s to lack of sleep. Toxins that do not escape the body during sleep are stored behind the brain and contribute to the beginnings of Alzheimer’s disease.
“You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house. You can’t do both at the same time,” Huffington said. “There is a clear connection between the epidemic of sleep deprivation and the epidemic of Alzheimer’s.”
During her speech, to the amusement of the audience, Huffington compared lack of sleep and the onset of Alzheimer’s disease to the Republican presidential frontrunner.
“Before Alzheimer’s, you get memory loss, you get difficulty consolidating information, you have difficulty processing information — you basically get Donald Trump,” Huffington said.
According to her own experiences, increasing her sleep from four to seven or eight hours dramatically altered her productivity. Huffington said that there are a few simple steps that students can do to get the highest quality sleep.
“It’s worth taking these few steps at the beginning — turning off our devices before we go to sleep, not charging our phones by our bed, disconnecting so that we can reconnect with ourselves and be fully charged,” she said.
Huffington addressed the dilemma many college students face between staying up all night to study or getting a full night’s sleep.
“All-nighters are the worst thing you can do,” Huffington said. “If you pull an all-nighter you go to your exam with the equivalent of 0.1 [percent] alcohol in your body. So would you ever take five shots before you run into an exam?”
When Huffington collapsed from sleep deprivation and exhaustion nine years ago, she decided to change her life and the lives of others who suffer from lack of sleep. Her number one New York Times bestseller Thrive described how she recovered from the stress she had put on her body and was the impetus for her next and most recent book, The Sleep Revolution.
Huffington has marketed her college tour with the hashtag “#sleeprevolution,” and encouraged attendees to use social media to record their own sleep routine. On this platform she has attempted to raise awareness of drowsy driving, which she said has caused 1.2 million crashes and sleep-associated mental illnesses.
“Lack of sleep can be a matter of life and death, so we’ve launched a campaign against drowsy driving,” Huffington said. “Because while drunk driving numbers are going down, in fact in half, since the designated driver campaign was launched drowsy driving numbers are going up.”
After Huffington summarized her findings in her book and fielded questions from students on how they could maximize their productivity through sleep, a sleep fair was opened, which hosted companies that offered products to increase and improve sleep. Kind, Sleep Number, Muse and Sonni advertised their sleep related products in the rear of the ballroom.
Huffington left students by emphasizing that in order to have the best nights sleep, there should be a fine line between being awake and being asleep.
“You have to create this clear demarcation line between your day life and your sleep,” Huffington said. “Life is really a dance — between making it happen and letting it happen. Live life as though everything is rigged in your favor.”

Matt Solowan, a Undergraduate Student Government diversity affairs delegate, believes every student, faculty member and visitor at USC should feel comfortable using the bathroom and has been advocating for more gender-neutral bathrooms on USC’s campus.
Gender-neutral bathrooms are often used by people who do not identify as male or female, by parents and caregivers whose children are of a different gender than they are and by people whose personal attendants or caretakers are of a different gender than they are. These bathrooms serve as a space for many individuals who have special needs or who are gender-nonconforming, featuring signage that uses inclusive language, not just male and female icons but signs that are void of any gender identity.
Only two of USC’s 78 buildings on the University Park Campus feature multi stall, gender-neutral bathrooms, according to the LGBT Resource Center website.
To assist these individuals, USC has been transitioning single accommodation restrooms into gender-neutral restrooms through improved signage. At USC, these bathrooms are located at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, the Engemann Health Center, Bovard Auditorium, among other buildings on campus. Associate Vice Provost of Student Affairs Timothy Bessolo noted that this action has been essential to fostering an inclusive and safe campus environment.
“Over the past year and a half, gender-neutral bathrooms were designated and new signage was created with the help of the LGBT Resource Center,” Bessolo said. “The University decided to designate these spaces to ensure we were creating a welcoming environment for all students, faculty, staff and guests on campus.”
As a member of the Queer & Ally Student Assembly and the Diversity Affairs committee, Solowan has been working with his fellow delegates and student directors to raise awareness about this issue and create a resolution that addresses and seeks to resolve grievances with the current state of gender-neutral bathrooms on campus.
“Last year, QuASA made it part of their mission to get gender-neutral bathrooms on campus and gender-neutral housing spaces in residence halls,” Solowan said. “While they were successful in getting the conversation about these important resources started, there is still quite a ways to go before our campus is 100 percent gender-inclusive.”
Solowan is looking particularly at what other college campuses are doing, in order to see what resources would be reasonable to request from the University.
“On the Diversity Affairs committee, we are researching what gender-neutral resources are available at other college campuses, working on a list of resources we would like to see implemented here at USC, and hopefully presenting those ideas to the administration,” Solowan said.
Solowan, who frequently uses gender-neutral restrooms since he does not always feel comfortable using gender-segregated ones, felt that there is much more work that needs to be done to ensure that everyone feels at ease using the bathroom. While Solowan claimed that the  gender-neutral bathrooms are well equipped, he said that the University has not constructed enough, particularly in residence halls.
“It is imperative for students who do not identify with either side of the gender binary or who may be in the process of transitioning between genders that there be somewhere for them to go to the bathroom,” Solowan said. “It is unfair to these students that they should have to search all over campus just to find somewhere to use the bathroom or that they should have to hold it in all day,”
Total and absolute nonsense. This is just another example of the chaos and lunacy that results when we abandon science, and indulge people who suffer with gender identity. This is quite literally a mental illness in every sense of the term because these people (who deserve our love and respect) are confused about their gender… one of the most easily identifiable and resolute aspects of us as human beings. Indeed, unlike sexuality which manifests across a wide spectrum… gender is absolute except in the rarest of circumstances (namely, hermaphrodite syndrome). Science, folks!! Moreover, many of these people who struggle with their gender identity nevertheless resolve to live in acceptance of their gender.
So, in review: The 99+% of society, comprising the vast majority of normal (yes, normal) and healthy people who do not suffer this most unfortunate disorder, are supposed to reorganize and disrupt their lives in accommodation of the smallest percentage of the smallest percentage of society by pretending gender does not matter, or even exist?.. in of all places, a restroom??!? This is a total disgrace.
Let’s be abundantly clear: Nobody of any disorder should be bullied or treated unfairly. By contrast, all people… no matter their condition or struggle… should be treated kindly and with love, acceptance and inclusion. BUT, public restrooms are NOT THE PLACE for this attempt at “inclusion”. Restrooms are fundamentally private spaces where nobody escapes the most fundamental practice of life: defecation and urination. That is largely their only purpose. They are not social houses or clubs. They are not lounges or meeting spaces. Get in and get out. Most importantly, restrooms should not be political pawns for people like Matt Solowan who wish to advance a social agenda, and normalize a condition that by no metric is normal.
STOP THIS NONSENSE PEOPLE. STOP THE CHAOS. I am sick and tired of hearing about the discomfort that so-called transgender people feel in choosing restrooms. Nevermind that there is no scientific basis for changing gender in the first place, let’s talk about the discomfort of the 99% of normal people who do not wish to be using a public restroom… perhaps standing at a urinal, fully exposed.. while someone of the opposite gender walks in. This is not cool, and people like me who feel this way should NOT be marginalized or made to feel guilty for this position.
I propose one, clear solution that represents a generous attempt at accommodating people who struggle with their gender: Single person, single use restrooms. Let’s build more of these. This is the type commonly seen at Starbucks or Subway, for example. They are intended for one person at a time, though they also accommodate breast-feeding mothers, parents with children, or persons needing a caregiver or attendant. They are also helpful for those who seek additional privacy when using the restroom, or persons needing to change clothes or do some quick grooming. They can be built near or adjacent to traditional multi-stall restrooms. Go in, lock the door, do your business. Nobody is offended, nobody is confused, nobody is bothered. If you suffer from gender identity, or simply wish to pose as the opposite gender, and feel confused or uncomfortable about which restroom to use… use one of these, and leave the rest of us alone. Get in and get out. It’s time for the “transgender” community to learn to process and deal with the consequences of their choices in a more meaningful, mature, scientific, and less selfish way.

In the workshops of the USC Rocket Propulsion Laboratory, one student is designing the skateboard of the future.
Ryan Olliges, a senior majoring in aerospace engineering, is the founder of 121C Boards, a company that creates skateboards and longboards using recycled material.
Olliges originally thought of the idea for 121C as a freshman in RPL, when he noticed how frequently aerospace companies threw away unnecessary carbon fiber.
“I first noticed the problem in the Rocket Lab on a small scale and thought it would be cool to make a skateboard,” Olliges said. “When I noticed how big of a problem it was on an industry scale for companies like Boeing and anybody else who uses composites, I knew we could do something to solve this problem.”
Olliges, a lifelong snowboarder and wakeboarder who took up skateboarding when he arrived at USC, decided to draw on his experience shaping longboards in high school to create 121C. Although he came up with the idea his freshman year, it wasn’t until his sophomore year when he partnered up with Greg Autry, an assistant professor of clinical entrepreneurship with the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at the Marshall School of Business, that the company started to take shape.
This, in addition to the support system the Rocket Lab has provided, has allowed Olliges to build his business into what it is now.
“[RPL] has been a great support system,” Olliges said. “The lab space on campus has been generous enough to let me keep some of my projects there and work alongside with them.”
Currently, the company is looking to expand its current product line using Kickstarter, as well as create recycled materials that can be used for products besides skateboards.
“We’ve got a couple contracts lined up take off with that,” Olliges said. “One of them is a briefcase company. They want us to make briefcase panels out of carbon fiber and then we’ve got a couple different companies that want us to make other parts.”
Olliges attributes most of the company’s success to how cheap 121c is able to make the boards by recycling the material it uses rather than buying it.
“If somebody was to make this board with material they bought from suppliers as opposed to material that they’re upcycling then it would cost them about $1,000,” Olliges said.
However, according to Olliges, even though the material is cheap, it still functions well in skateboards.
“It turns out that [the material] is actually really good for skateboarding and a lot of other things because it’s incredibly lightweight and much stronger than your standard consumer grade carbon fiber resin,” Olliges said. “For skateboarding, that means you can pop in and out of your turns and you can’t break your skateboard.”
But for Olliges, the greatest challenge may have been figuring out how to create the boards in the first place. This is most evident in the name of 121c, which is derived from the original cure temperature of epoxy, 121 degrees celsius.
“It took me forever to get this thing to finally heat up. I burned a bunch of stuff, caught things on fire, melted my tooling and then finally got it right,” Olliges said. “It was just a very long and arduous process, so after it finally heated up to 121c the name just kind of just stuck.”

The Middle East Studies program at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences hosted a discussion called “Palestine in Ruins: The Nakba and Erasure of Memory” on Wednesday at the Von KleinSmid Center, which featured researcher and writer Noga Kadman.
Originally from Jerusalem, Kadman began her involvement in human rights organizations, at age 25 focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“Through this work, I became curious, and wanted to learn the roots of the conflict,” Kadman said.
Kadman focuses on human rights in present-day Israel in her recently published book, Erased from Space and Consciousness: Israel and the Depopulated Palestinian Villages of 1948. She shared her extensive research on the more than 400 depopulated Palestinian villages owing to a 1948 conflict between Palestine and Israel.
“I wanted to understand where those people came from,” Kadman said.
She depicts the effects of the conflict between Israel and Palestine, which escalated into a full-scale war in 1947.
“There was a demographic shift in population of the country, from a predominantly Palestinian country to a predominantly Jewish country … some 750,000 people [refugees] had to flee their houses mostly due to military attacks against their communities […]” Kadman said.
She focuses her research on the demolished villages and the success of the Israeli state in erasing any remembrance of Palestinian history.
“All the land, houses, everything that was in the houses, everything else, became Israel state property,” Kadman said.
More specifically, she lauds Kibbutz Sasa, an Israeli community that continued housing a mosque which survived despite extreme pressure from the Israeli army to be demolished.
“But I found only one community that dealt a lot with what I saw as contradiction to their ideology and the reality of living in a depopulated village … and it is Kibbutz Sasa, the houses and villages of Sa’sa’, just near the border of Lebanon,” Kadman said.
Through her exploration, Kadman found that the education in Israel and Palestine was unequal. Kadman attested to the controversy between the ideologies of many citizens of Israel and Palestine and their need to place blame on historical decisions made by leaders before them.
Those involved with coordinating the event praised Kadman’s ability to reveal topics with undeniable historical relevance. Students and faculty alike expressed their interest in working alongside professionals in research.
“We always like to bring people actively researching on these topics,” said Camillia Shofani, the program assistant for the Middle East Studies program.
Kadman said that solving the conflict requires redefining the understanding of Palestinian involvement, which is not explicitly stated in educational textbooks or governmental sites, such as the Jewish National Fund.
“If we want to think about solving the conflict, I believe that the first step is looking with open eyes at what happened in 1948 and to take responsibility for our part,” Kadman said.
By exposing the information and its significance, Kadman hopes to alter Israeli discourse on the Palestinians, better unify relations between the two countries and help inspire an informed, joint future.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the event was titled “Palestine in Ruins: The Erasure of Memory.” It was “Palestine in Ruins: The Nakba and Erasure of Memory.” The article also referred to the Jewish National Forest. It is the Jewish National Fund. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.
Thank you for this. I would hope that the Shoah Foundation would add the stories of the victims of the Nakba to their Visual History Archives while there’s still time.

The space between Taper Hall and Bovard is often overlooked, passed by many students rushing to get to class. But every Wednesday on a patch of grass mats are laid out, a sign is put up and people put their belongings aside and take a seat. Griffin Damron, a sophomore majoring in sociology and NGOs and social change, sets up a timer for 40 minutes, the amount of time the group can allow themselves to forget everything and just be. After pressing the start button, Damron settles into a cross-legged position and closes his eyes, to which everyone follows. Meditation has begun.
“If you look around, you’ll see that everyone is thinking way too much,” Damron said. “At USC there’s a culture of high achievement and working hard, and you always have to be on top of everything. But no one even considers taking time out of their day to just think, and be, and exist, which is so important.”
Damron had been practicing meditation on and off for a few years, but after revisiting it last summer, he realized he wanted to share the awareness of his surroundings mediation gave him with his peers. Through working together with his friends Chris Robinson and Natalie Raphael, they founded BreatheSC, a meditation club on campus that holds sessions from Mondays through Wednesdays. Raphael stresses the effect of meditation on someone’s well-being.
“Now more than ever people constantly medicate themselves in order to escape reality, whether that be with alcohol or drugs,” Raphael, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said. “Meditation forces you to accept reality for what it is and act mindfully … since you are truly forced to be in tune with your internal self as well, which is also something super rare, but super crucial in order to living a fulfilled life.”
What makes BreatheSC unique from other yoga and mindfulness clubs on campus is the emphasis on its online presence through its Facebook page and group. The Facebook page promotes other organizations hosting weekly meditation sessions such as Mindful USC and Heartfulness, as well as the upcoming sessions for that week. The group, on the other hand, functions more like a community, sharing albums from meditation sessions as well as articles about the benefits of mindfulness.
Raphael states that there’s an incentive for students to meditate as well — in her own experience, meditation has improved her personal and academic life.
“I used to have to drink coffee before going into my night classes,” Raphael said. “If not I would have to force myself to keep my eyes open. But now i just meditate before my class … Meditation is the key to sustained energy.”
Even though the organization started in March, Breathe SC aspires to reach more than 100 people for meditation sessions in McCarthy Quad in the coming semester as well as hold some sort of an all-day yoga and meditation festival at USC. Members such as Vanessa Batyko find meditation to be more enhanced when done with a group of people.
“Since this club started, it gives me an incentive that makes me want to be here every single day meditating,” Batyko said. “It’s such a great environment of people that I know are also genuinely interested in the practice.”
Despite these aspirations, the group never forgets about their roots, always making time at the end of meditation to talk about each individual’s experience. While the group consists mostly of people who practice meditation on their own, BreatheSC recognizes that the process is a shared experience.
“At the end of the meditation, we talk about how our experiences are, and that’s my favorite part,” Raphael said. “A lot of times the way someone describes how their meditation was going is similar to my own experience … It’s a good reminder that you’re not alone and at the end of the day, you can relate to almost anyone in some way.”

At a tough course against top competition, junior Rico Hoey, sophomore Jonah Texeira, senior Andrew Levitt and freshman Justin Suh all finished among the top individual scorers at the 70th Annual Western Intercollegiate to help the Trojans finish second in the three-round competition with a score of 1-over par.
In what was essentially a team-for-team preview of the Pac-12 Championship, the top-ranked Trojans completed their regular season against seven other conference rivals, four of which are ranked in the nation’s top 25. No. 7 Arizona State, No. 25 Washington and No. 15 California struggled to keep up at Pasatiempo Golf Club in Santa Cruz; each team finished above ten strokes over par. Oregon, who currently sits just one spot outside of the top 25, finished in third place with a score of +9. Stanford, the nation’s No. 9-ranked team, ran away from the rest of the competition, winning the tournament by ten strokes with a final score of -9.
USC was fairly consistent from round to round, but saw their stroke total increase slightly each day. This trend was fairly common among the entire field, though some teams slipped more than others. Oregon, for example, had a 4-stroke lead after one round of the competition, only to fall to third place in the standings by the end of the tournament.
Individual golfers’ scores typically trended the same direction; Hoey and Levitt followed each round with either the same or more strokes than they had in the previous one, while sophomore Jonah Texeira posted scores of 72, 67 and 69, consecutively. Hoey, Texeira and Levitt all finished tied for fourth in the tournament. Suh followed closely behind with a final tally of -1, good for a tie for eighth in the tournament.
Sophomore Sean Crocker, projected to be the Trojans’ second-best golfer for the tournament, finished fifth individually on the team but tied for 37th overall with a final score of +8. Ryan Slater, another freshman, finished with a final score of +20.
Maverick McNealy — a Stanford junior — led the Cardinal to the team victory with a tournament-best -16 after shooting impressive rounds of 66, 64 and 64, consecutively. Three other Stanford golfers finished at or below par, while their bottom two finishers were only 9-over.
Tenth-year head coach Chris Zambri and the Trojans have their work cut out for them if they hope to win the conference championship at the end of the month, where the rankings mean about as much as the golfers’ practice swings. Though USC currently holds the top national ranking according to Golfstat, they’ll have to keep pushing to beat Stanford and the rest of their West Coast competition.
With the regular season wrapped up, the Trojans will look now to the Pac-12 Championships, which begin on April 29 in Salt Lake City.

Back atop the AVCA National Poll for the first time since early March, the beach volleyball team will now ride a 15-match winning streak into Merle Norman Stadium this Thursday when they host a crucial match-up against rival and No. 2-ranked Pepperdine for Senior Day at 4:30 p.m.
The Women of Troy reclaimed their status as the top team in the nation after a successful showing at the USAV Beach Collegiate Challenge last weekend, where they went 2-0 in dual matches and put six pairs on the medal podium for the pairs competition. The No. 1 ranking was previously held by Pepperdine (15-2) for five weeks, but USC (19-2) was able to knock them off on Saturday in come-from-behind fashion to take the 3-2 victory at Hermosa Beach.
Arguably the two best beach volleyball programs in the country since the introduction of the sport to the collegiate ranks in 2012, USC and Pepperdine have often produced close matches and exciting finishes. That meeting in Hermosa Beach would mark the sixth straight time that a USC-Pepperdine dual resulted in a 3-2 final score, as well as the fourth time that the teams met as No. 1 versus No. 2.
Thursday’s upcoming match marks the third time that the Women of Troy and the Waves will face off in 2016, and the second time in six days. Both teams split the previous meetings this season, although the Waves’ first win came on their home sand at Zuma Beach, while the second meeting had the Women of Troy win on a neutral court. USC will have the upper hand in this third meeting, as they play at Merle Norman Stadium for Senior Day.
Playing in their final regular season home game will be seniors Alexa Strange, Zoe Nightingale, and Emily Young. Strange, who transferred to USC in 2014 from Nebraska, has the most game-time experience of the three upperclassmen as the No. 2 pairing with junior Sophie Bukovec, while Nightingale plays at Court 5 with sophomore Jo Kremer. Young is partnered with freshman Becca Dunn and recently won the silver medal in the bronze bracket of the USAV Beach Collegiate pairs tournament.
Young has been a familiar face for many that follow USC’s volleyball programs, as she was a former team captain and four-year letterwinner indoors under head coach Mick Haley. Originally from Illinois, Young transitioned to the sand after completing her indoor career in the fall of 2014, while Nightingale comes to USC by way of crosstown rival UCLA. The Sacramento, California native arrived this season after completing her four-year career playing both indoor and sand in Westwood. With one year left of eligibility as a graduate transfer, Nightingale decided to suit up for the Women of Troy in hopes of helping the program make history as the first ever NCAA Beach Volleyball champions.
All three of USC’s seniors will be honored in pre-game festivities at 3:50 p.m. First serve against the Waves will begin at approximately 4:30 p.m.

From time to time, I close my eyes and imagine the 8-year-old kid who used to run up and down a shadow-filled court under the stars with a basket barely lit up by the radiant moon and a flickering light. He stood with the ball in a triple-threat position at the top of the 3-point line with an imaginary defender in front of him and a dwindling shot clock in the back of his head. He put his head down, took a couple dribbles and rose up over the outstretched arms of the make-believe player while fading away. A follow-through and silent buzzer-like sound later, a hissing swish echoed throughout the outdoor arena.
The voice of his dad then emerged in the background. “It’s time to go,” he said, but the boy didn’t want to leave. “One more shot.” As his shot went up and the ball continually rotated in an imperfect revolution towards the rim, the lights went out — the price he paid for wanting to be like Kobe. The lights would eventually turn back on, but the boy’s father was gone … So he decided to keep shooting, with nothing present but the vision of his idol, and he wouldn’t stop until sunrise. That young boy was me, dreaming of becoming someone who I would never become. Someone who inspired not only me, but also a league, a city and the world to always and only strive for greatness. Anything less was a failure. That’s why I hated Kobe “Bean” Bryant, but also why I loved him.
Words cannot begin to describe what Kobe meant to that young boy, and that admiration has not gone anywhere over a decade later. Growing up, there’s no one I looked up to more than number eight turned 24. When I realized I wasn’t going to be him on the court, I aspired to instead emulate his grit, work ethic and competitive mentality.
Growing up without a dad, it was Kobe who played the role of a father figure in my life, even if he didn’t know it. He taught me how to grind, how to trust, how to demand perfection and that the only thing standing in the way of me and getting to the basket of anything in life was myself. I absolutely wouldn’t be where I am today without Kobe, and I’m forever grateful for that.
All I can say Kobe, is thank you: For five Lakers championships, for giving me the courage to attempt to jump over moving cars (there’s video proof), for giving me strength in the face of adversity and for allowing me to fall so deeply in love with you. It was only fitting that the shirt on my back while watching your final minutes on the floor was inscribed with that magical four-letter word — love.
I still recall when I, an 8-year-old kid, first watched you show off that silky fadeaway jumper of yours — true greatness in the making. It was love at first sight.
Why did I always bite down on my jersey? I wanted to be like Kobe. Why did I get up after falling down? I wanted to be like Kobe. Why did I always strive to be the first one to wake up and the last one to go to sleep? I wanted to be like Kobe. I desired to be like him so desperately that I would forget he was also human, though he didn’t play like one sometimes.
Like anyone else, he also had his dark side. He inflicted on me stress, frustration and even disappointment, but my love for Kobe and his love for the game kept me coming back to him every single time.
That’s why after going on and off for 20 years, Wednesday night felt like heartbreak. Standing just a few rows away, tears streamed down my cheeks because it felt like this time was finally the last. It had to be, even if I still don’t think I’m quite ready to let go just yet.
My heart hurt seeing Kobe walking off that court for the last time, but it’s OK. My heart can take the pounding, as long as this is what he wants. That’s the least I can do because he gave me so much.
And while Kobe might have very well hung ’em up for the last time, I will never stop loving him. Just like the championship banners that hang in perpetuity in the rafters, the lessons and memories he has given me will keep my heart beating forever.

Both the Men and Women of Troy will take the courts at Marks Stadium this Sunday to face off in crucial Pac-12 and Crosstown Cup matches against the UCLA Bruins. At 12:30 p.m., the men and women will take the court alongside each other, with each team playing three doubles matches. After the doubles action wraps up, the men will take the court for their singles matches, with the women beginning their singles play immediately upon completion of the men’s match.
This will be the second meeting for the teams this season, with both the USC men and women falling to UCLA by a score of 5-2 in matches earlier this season held in Westwood.
The No. 21 USC women are on the rise, riding their recent momentum to a 6-0 Pac-12 record. The UCLA Women are not far behind, posting a 6-2 record in Pac-12 play and following just behind the Trojans with a ranking of 23. The men’s matchup between the top-10 ranked crosstown foes has major implications, with UCLA ranked fourth and USC ranked ninth. The Bruins are undefeated at 6-0 in the Pac-12 and in the midst of an 11-match win streak, but the Trojans have an impressive record of their own at 5-1 in Pac-12 and a five-match win streak of their own.
For the men, both teams have plenty of firepower in singles, setting up for a long battle. At the top, the Trojans carry senior Max de Vroome, junior Nick Crystal and freshman Logan Smith, ranked 19th, 43rd and 55th, respectively. UCLA is just as strong in the rankings, with junior Mackenzie McDonald, sophomore Martin Redlicki and junior Gage Brymer ranked 8th, 45th and 58th respectively, setting up exciting match ups. The Trojans’ youth continues to shine in the rest of their singles players, with No. 106 freshman Jake Devine and  No. 120 sophomore Thibault Forget. Freshman Laurens Verboven has contributed in both his doubles and singles play, and fellow freshman Jack Jaede has been a key contributor to several matches this season. The Trojans won all three matches last year and hope to return to their winning ways to even the season series.
The Women of Troy are led by standout senior Giuliana Olmos, playing No. 1-seed matches all season on her way to a ranking of 24th in the country. The deep roster contains plenty of youth, with sophomores Gabby Smith and Madison Westby, along with freshman Jessica Failla and Rianna Valdes all appearing in the rankings this past week. Westby comes in with experience from a full season played last year, with one of the highlights being clinching an exciting 4-3 victory against UCLA last season at Mark’s Stadium.
The “new look team” this season took some adjustments, as the Trojans fell in the rankings early in the year. Since a difficult stretch when they dropped three matches in a row, the Women of Troy have looked almost unbeatable, winning seven matches in a row, with the closest contest still a commanding 5-2 victory over Oklahoma State. UCLA brings only one nationally ranked player, senior Catherine Harrison at No. 17, but she will provide a difficult challenge for her likely opponent Olmos and each match is expected to be competitive in an important rivalry match. USC hopes to continue its impressive win streak and stay atop the Pac-12 standings, along with gaining bragging rights over UCLA.
The women’s coaching matchup is especially intriguing due to the extreme similarities in the two coaches. USC’s Richard Gallien is in his 21st season at the helm of the Women of Troy, posting a record of 378-148, while UCLA’s Stella Sampras-Webster is in her 20th season with the Bruins, posting a record of 382-141.

This week, the No. 14 men’s and No. 3 women’s track and field team will attend three different events at two different locations over three different days.
The busy schedule begins Thursday with the 58th annual Mount San Antonio College Relays, in Norwalk, California, and the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate, hosted by Long Beach State University, in Long Beach, California. Though the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate ends Thursday, competition at Long Beach State will resume Friday and Saturday for the 22nd annual Beach Invitational; the Mt. SAC Relays will also continue until Saturday afternoon.
Ahead of the eventful week, which is in the midst of a full outdoor season, redshirt senior sprinter Tynia Gaither gave her thoughts on her and her teammates’ current mindset.
“I definitely feel ready,” Gaither said. “We’re a really strong mental team; we can take on anything. So, we look forward to our competition, and we look forward to going out there and doing our best every time, no matter what.”
Gaither is poised to compete at the Mt. SAC Relays this weekend. She will participate in the women’s 100-meter dash collegiate open on Friday, alongside sophomore Deanna Hill, junior Destinee Brown, and sophomore Gabriella Cantrell; senior Alexis Faulknor will compete in the women’s 100-meter dash invitational collegiate open the next day. Faulknor will also run in the women’s 200-meter dash invitational on Saturday, with Gaither and Hill. Finally, Gaither will anchor the women’s 4×100 meter relay invitational, which is also composed of Faulknor, Hill and Brown, on Saturday.
USC will be heavily represented at the Mt. SAC Relays this year. Trojan athletes will participate in the majority of scheduled events: the men and women’s 100-meter, 200-meter and 400-meter dashes, the men and women’s 800-meter, 1500-meter and 5000-meter runs, the men and women’s 4×100 meter and 4×400 meter relays, as well as both teams’ long jump events, discus throws, hammer throws and shot put events.
The Trojans’ highly respected throwers coach, Dan Lange, commented on how his freshmen athletes have performed so far this season.
“Exceptionally well,” Lange said. “The two freshmen boys, Nathan Bultman and Matt Katnik, they’re going great; they’re surpassing expectations at this point.”
Lange added that the entire group has impressed on and off the field.
“I just feel like this group of throwers, from a character standpoint, is amongst the best I’ve ever had in 27 years,” Lange said. “They’re great athletes, but they’re really, really, high quality people.”
Though most of his athletes, including recent USC Credit Union student-athlete of the week, senior Tera Novy, will compete at the Mt. SAC Relays, some of his throwers will feature in at least one event at the Beach Invitational in Long Beach. Freshman Nathan Bultman and redshirt sophomore David Sellens III will participate in the men’s hammer throws, while junior Tanya Sapa and redshirt junior Erika Peyton will look to perform well in the women’s hammer throws.
In Long Beach, the men and women of Troy will participate in more than throwing events. Senior Felicia Horvath will pole vault on Thursday during the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate and again later during the Beach Invitational. Redshirt freshman Madison Ricks, senior Katerina Berdousi, senior Jenna Tong and freshman Sophia Racette will compete in the women’s 1500-meter run, while sophomore Mitchell Cameron and freshman Trent Rule will do the same in the men’s event. More Trojans will also feature in dashes and runs throughout the Long Beach events.
Sophomore jumper Dominic Smallwood, set to perform in the men’s triple jump and long jump at Mt. SAC, spoke to how he sees the team performing from now on.
“We’re right where we need to be,” Smallwood said. “Of course, we’re gonna start opening up, hitting bigger marks and hitting faster times.”
Next weekend, USC’s track and field team are going to La Jolla, California, to take part in the Triton Invitational. That will precede the much anticipated USC-UCLA Dual Meet, which will occur the following week in Westwood.

The International Student Assembly, part of the Undergraduate Student Government’s Program Board, brings its biggest event of the year to campus this Friday: Globefest. Globefest is an annual event taking place over the past five years that features cultures from around the world.
Students can partake in different activities, watch performances, and eat food from different countries, ultimately contributing to ISA’s mission of providing cultural and educational programs to the USC community.
Two years ago, Globefest was held off campus at the Lorenzo and brought a live camel to students. Last year Globefest moved on campus and featured Traveler the horse in McCarthy Quad. This year, ISA is making Globefest bigger and better than ever, bringing a live sloth, a mini alpaca, and a mini pony.
“I’m most excited about the animals,” said Gisella Tan, director of ISA. “My favorite animal is an alpaca, so I was disappointed when DPS notified us that the largest animal size we could have was a goat, but we managed to find a solution — mini alpacas!”
Globefest will also feature free food, including boba from Ozero Tea and Desserts and Quickly Boba LA, various Peruvian desserts, Hawaiian barbecue from Rutts Hawaiian Cafe and Catering, Greek skewers from Good Greek Grub, and free frozen yogurt from Yogurtland.
Activities at Globefest include an obstacle course, a sumo suit contest, origami making, lantern making, air hockey, Diwali diya making, calligraphy, hair braiding, mosaic flower pot decorating, and cornholes. ISA will also be bringing in specialists such as a henna artist, a caricaturist and a fortune teller to really capture various cultures.
A highlight of the event will be performances from USC student organizations such as USC Drishti and USC Shinkendo, as well as a stand out fire-based performance from Aztec dancers with audience participation. The event will also include various raffles and a life-size map where guests can pin where they are from to celebrate the diversity at USC.
Globefest takes place Friday from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. and will span McCarthy Quad and Alumni Park. ISA will also be hosting a soccer tournament, World Cup, in conjunction to the diverse programming. The event will be held at Brittingham Field from 1
to 5 p.m.

In the rapidly evolving entertainment industry, actress and singer-songwriter Ashley Noel Long is on the rise. The freshman majoring in theatre was one of 21 finalists selected out of a pool of 11,000 applicants for the YoungArts Theater program. The National YoungArts Foundation serves as the main agency for the U.S. Presidential Scholars in the Arts, the highest honor for young artists. The foundation’s mission is to nurture the talent of the most accomplished young artists and assist them during their educational and professional development.
Long was introduced to music at a young age and instantly became captivated by the idea of expressing herself through acting and singing. She sat down with the Daily Trojan to talk about the beginning of her journey and the road ahead.
 
Daily Trojan: In what moment did you realize music was your calling?
Ashley Long: A universal language was fostered in my heart and embedded into my little world at a young age — music. From my understanding, music has always been in my life. I remember the first time I heard my father play guitar, an unexpected chill ran down my spine. I discovered instantaneously that music has an extraordinary power to evoke emotion. Unbeknownst to me, this discovery soon sparked a passion in my life, and I admittedly became consumed with music. Music gave me the freedom to write my thoughts and feelings on paper, bond with my father, and capture life’s moments and their ensuing emotions.
DT: How was starting a musical career at a young age?
AL: I never really thought of my music as a career when I was younger. I was really enjoying writing, performing at venues, and meeting various people that influenced my life greatly. Around the age of 14, I realized that music and the arts were all that ever made sense to me. When I perform, I simply see the world in a different light.
DT: Did your perspective on what you were doing change as you got older?
AL: Honestly, every moment that has happened to me artistically has shaped me to who I am wholeheartedly. Music has been a cathartic escape where I can release my thoughts and be heard. I begin to love and appreciate people more and have realized that the arts have that power to change lives, hearts and minds.
DT: Who are your musical inspirations and why?
AL: I like to take influences mainly from the sounds of Norah Jones, Carole King, Adele, Ingrid Michaelson, but also many other brilliant songwriters inspire me on a daily basis.
 
DT: What has been your most meaningful performance?
AL: I don’t know if I can really decide on one performance … There have been so many memorable moments at various shows that are important in their own aspect. If I had to decide, I’d say playing for the president of Capitol Records at a venue in Texas was an incredible experience that stands out.
DL: You’ve had the opportunity of working with various highly respected professionals in the entertainment industry. Which was the most impactful of these experiences?
AL: I have really been blessed to work with such brilliant and inspiring artists in the medium of the arts. Nikki Pederson, a highly esteemed Texas talent scout, is one of the mostoutstanding individuals that really guided my artistic career at a young age. She remains as one of my mentors and greatest influence in my life. Additionally, at the age of fourteen, I was blessed to meet the Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Sarah Kelly. Sarah eventually changed my music journey and thus, my life. Sarah Kelly essentially took me under her wing and began honing my skills as a singer-songwriter. Through her guidance, I have written over 20 songs, performed at a multitude of live venues, and recorded an EP album that was released last year, called In Your Own Skin. I will infinitely appreciate and cherish Sarah Kelly’s mentorship. She was truly one of the greatest influences in my life.
DT: Since you’re a current freshmen in college, do you fear that your artistic/musical career may deprive you from having a typical college experience? Why or why not?
AL: College has given me the ability to learn and grow as an artist. I am gaining more life experience and becoming a more holistic being and stronger artist from studying here. I have had phenomenal experiences here at USC and made incredible, lasting friendships. I believe that all of the experiences I have made here will only aid into the work I do. I have attained such a great deal of artistic opportunities here at USC performing in shows, working on films, seeing incredible speakers, attaining a highly competitive internship, working with phenomenal faculty, and more from being here. It is all a journey, and I am happy where I am at and excited to see where it leads in the future.
DT: Is your family supportive of your career? How?
AL: Extremely. I cannot imagine any of the experiences I have had without the unbelievable help and support from family. My mom and dad amaze me with their constant support and generosity, and I am infinitely thankful. I would not have been able to experience and accomplish what I have thus far without their encouragement, support and constant love.
DT: How did you feel when you were selected as one of the 21 YoungArts Theater Winners?
AL: YoungArts was truly the most powerful experience of my life. The lifelong friendships I formed, the unbelievable connections I gathered, the brilliant and insightful knowledge that was shared with me, the phenomenal opportunities I was presented and the constant kindness I was shown by the alumni, mentors and staff, will always remain my inspiration and motivation to continue to grow, explore and challenge myself creatively and confidently.
DT: Can you tell me more about this award and its meaning?
AL: I was one of the 21 [finalists] selected out of a pool of [11,000] talented applicants. I received a generous scholarship of aid in my college endeavors to attend National YoungArts week in Miami. I am forever influenced by my teacher’s tear-inspiring and educational presence, such as Shalita Grant, Zuzanna Szadkowski, Josh Groban, James Caan, Phylicia Rashad and more beautiful beings. YoungArts was an incredible experience and I recommend anyone in high school pursuing the arts to apply to this program.
DT: What is your short-term goal as an actress and as a musician?
AL: I want to hone my craft as an actor and singer-songwriter and continue to learn and grow in all facets of the arts.
DT: Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
AL: Doing what I love: acting in any medium of television, film and theater in Los Angeles as a working actor, along with continuing to write and perform my music live professionally.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Ashley Long was one of 21 winners selected out of a pool of 17,000 applicants. She was one of 21 finalists out of a pool of 11,000. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

There is a scene in the fourth season of Game of Thrones where Jon Snow tells Ygritte, who is a warrior, that girls “swoon” and “faint and collapse” at the sight of blood. Ygritte is bewildered. The conversation goes like this:
Ygritte: Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
Jon: Well … Not all girls are like you.
Ygritte: Girls see more blood than boys!
Ygritte’s tone is cheeky, and the moment turns into cute banter between the two. It’s an easily forgettable scene in a show as dynamic as Game of Thrones, but the night that episode aired, many women took to the internet to share their amusement. It is very clear that Jon Snow knows nothing — about periods.
There is a common misconception that women and girls faint at the sight of blood, which doesn’t make sense. Once every month, millions of uterus-owners bleed from their bodies. This bleeding is often accompanied by soreness and cramps, and yet, women and girls are expected to have a fragile constitution when it comes to blood.
Flow: The Cultural Story of Menstruation aims to make sense of the misperception of periods.
“The sad fact is that menstruation — the process, the images, the word itself — is as unspeakable and undercover as it ever was,” write authors Elissa Stein and Susan Kim. “In fact, although you can watch buckets of fake blood merrily sploodging out of heads and torsos … rarely will you ever see a single drop as a result of menstruation.”
Stein and Kim are appalled by the way society has forced women to talk about periods: “You’re on the Rag. Your Friend’s in Town, or maybe it’s your Aunt Flo Who’s Come to Visit.” In Finland, premenstrual syndrome , with symptoms including mood swings, tender breasts, food cravings, fatigue, irritability and depression, is called Mad Cow Disease.
When someone is over-emotional, we call them hysterical, as in someone who suffers from hysteria. What most people don’t know is that hysteria comes from the Greek word hysterikos, which means “of the womb.” How misogynistic is that?
Perhaps there is so much confusion around periods because they’re considered taboo. In school, girls talk about their periods in hushed terms. Grown women hide their tampons and pads in purse pockets, lest a glimpse of the packaging offends a man or two. (Trans men who have not had sex-reassignment surgery and have periods also must hide their tampons and pads for fear of being outed to the world as transgender.)
On Instagram, where pictures of mostly-naked people are acceptable and venerated, a picture of an artist lying in bed with a period stain in view was taken down twice. A 2015 photo series in the Cosmopolitan had to be tagged as “Not Safe for Work” because it prominently featured period blood.
Viagra ads talk about erectile dysfunction, but tampon and pad ads aren’t allowed to use the word “vagina.” Note that the former is an ad for an elective medicine and the latter is an ad for necessary “feminine hygiene” products.
For Stein and Kim, the lack of easily accessible information about periods is something to be concerned about.
“What happens when your period doesn’t quite play out like a tampon ad? What if you secretly have real questions? What’s the point of getting a period? What did women do before pads and tampons? What about new drugs that promise to end periods — a hot idea or not? Sex during your period: gross or a turn-on? And what’s normal, anyway?” write Stein and Kim.
Stein and Kim wrote Flow because they couldn’t find “a single book that [modern] women could relate to.”
Here are the five things the authors didn’t know before writing Flow:
– A period on the Pill isn’t really a period.
– Doctors once stimulated patients to clitoral orgasms as treatment for hysteria.
– Bloodletting came about to mimic menstruation, which has been seen as a way to relieve bodies of noxious blood.
– Hormone replacement drugs are made from the urine of pregnant mares.
– There’s a thriving menstrual porn industry.
As for what I didn’t know about periods before reading Flow? Well, that could fill up an entire book.

We all know and love the top 40 musical artists on the radio. They have a certain pop-savvy vibe that really hits home with almost every listener. However, there are also artists that are many people skim over when shuffling through their Spotify playlists. Here are seven contemporary underrated artists that deserve a listen. 
This British singer-songwriter just had a radio hit with his haunting “Let it Go,” but he has yet to really create a strong following after some time. Why you should listen? His incredible vocals and stripped down performances sound raw and real with the power to move you to tears. 
This Canadian artist is like a more refined Lady Gaga. Her ethereal voice and looks give a dichotomy to her girly-grunge rebel music. She is truly an artist with a thoroughly interesting vibe that connects with just about anyone. 
This soulful siren will be singing at Coachella in just a few weeks and is a definite must-see. She is a self-taught musician with so much talent in communicating emotion, her work holistic masterpieces.
For all fans of electronic music, Kygo should be a breath of fresh air for you. His deep house and tropical house mixes involve fun lyrics, top vocalists and low, tropical bass. His music has been playing at various places but he doesn’t seem to be a frontrunner in the EDM world quite yet. 
If you want a little fun and crazy, this South African duo definitely brings it. They are a bit over the edge, but they bring a rebellion to the pop music world that defies many genres traditional notions of music. Their songs are upbeat, unique and dynamic, the kind that will lift you up almost instantly.  
Another EDM duo, this group is actually fairly well known. They are associated with Tiesto and have gathered a substantial following within the EDM world in the last year. However, they are still grossly underrated and have yet to make huge headway as a household electronic name.
This female vocalist is often associated with Clean Bandit’s radio hit “Rather Be.” This artist has one of the most unique voices I’ve ever heard that it’s a wonder she isn’t one of the top female vocalists currently. Give some of her songs a listen, and you’ll be stunned by her slightly raspy and metallic voice that perfectly captures every song she sings.

On March 23, the last batch of golden acceptance packages were mailed to thousands of potential Trojans for the class of 2020. According to data from USC Admissions, this past year showcased the most competitive admissions cycle — a whopping 16.5 percent admission rate, with 31 percent of the admits boasting an unweighted 4.0 GPA. It’s no secret that stellar grades, enrollment in AP/IB classes and star-studded extracurricular activities are essential for admission to any competitive college. However, in addition to this more-than-full plate, college admissions place an over-emphasis on leadership more than anything, making it not just a factor in a student’s holistic acceptance — but an obsession.
According to the USC Admissions website, leadership is one of the factors that the University takes into consideration, in addition to grades, curriculum, service and unique talents. It’s not enough to have good test scores — many admitted students were class presidents, editors-in-chief, valedictorians and National Merit Finalists. Admissions committee members judge applicants on their potential for leadership once they arrive on campus, but this type of judgment doesn’t go away after admissions — this mindset continues to perpetuate once students are on a college campus.
There is a cynical interpretation of the way the word “leadership” is used in American higher education, especially at universities like USC. Conflating actual leadership with the business-like rhetoric of admissions personnel and corporate culture — the idea that a person is only successful if they are in a leadership role — is extremely fallacious.
Almost a century ago, admissions officers at Ivy League schools decided that “leadership” needed to be an important admissions consideration because simply admitting the best academic performers excluded too many “leaders,” resulting in a student body unrepresentative and ill-fitting of the institutions’ values and history. Though this change had laudable intentions, over the years, the definition of the word “leadership” has been considerably diluted.
The word “leadership” is tossed around on campus, but if examined closely, it’s broad and hard to define. A leader is such a broad term, some would define a leader as somebody who can command a large crowd — extroverted, assertive, with strong social and networking skills to fit the ideal mold.
However, by perpetuating a narrow view of a “leader,” the emphasis on a specific type of leadership eschews and devalues other potentially important roles like being a team player or a lone wolf. Like leaders, those who are team players or lone wolves can be just as bright, motivated, passionate and curious of individuals. Whether it be the introverted student who influences behind the scenes or the rebellious genius who does not see the value of hierarchy, everybody executes their gifts in a different way.
In a Harvard Business Review article, Dean Ernest Wilson III of the Annenberg School of Communication of Journalism notes his three-year journey of compiling data that answered his question of what qualities were critical to success. He talked to people from all over the world, from business executives in Los Angeles to public relations professionals in Shanghai, everybody with acknowledged the necessity of one quality — empathy.
“All of the people we interviewed were serious business executives. Empathy was not the first virtue I associated with the rough-and-tumble of today’s highly competitive business world. I expected to hear about boldness, perseverance and toughness,” Wilson wrote in his article.
According USC Third Space, emotional intelligence is essential to cultural competence. Empathy is essential in effective leadership because it allows people to see the world through the eyes of others and to constantly be looking at things in different perspectives.
Whether it be through leadership roles, job offers or college admissions, there is a stigma toward soft attributes like emotional intelligence and empathy, when in fact they are essential to the inner-workings or any business, organization and university. Defining a leader as an extrovert precisely excludes those who are introverts but nevertheless have the potential to ignite positive change on campus. There are lone but brilliant thinkers whose contributions make us rethink our way of living.
The reality is that all college grads, even as heads of companies, are going to end up working in teams, so the notion that leadership is the most important quality should be shifted towards the development of other character traits such as empathy and teamwork.
The admissions process is extremely flawed, leading prospective students to believe that the only way to get to their dream school is to be the president of a club or to fit a certain mold. If colleges were to place more value on interpersonal approaches in their admissions, it would diversify and reshape what it means to be a valuable and ideal leader.
As a former admission professional, I’d like to reassure Ms. Lee that empathy and emotional maturity are vital to being admitted to selective colleges.  It is precisely those qualities that admission officers look for in all of those essays!  While a college’s marketing materials may trumpet the number of valedictorians, team captains, and entrepreneurs in a freshman class, it is demonstrated character (or lack thereof) which will sway the admission decision every time.  Contrary to Ms. Lee’s assertion that there is a “stigma” against “emotional intelligence and empathy” in admission, it was my experience that these qualities were actually the most valued in the admission process.  Also, it is important to remember (as former Stanford and Princeton admission Dean Fred Hargadon often said) that holding leadership roles and having empathy and emotional intelligence are not mutually exclusive characteristics.  They are often found in the same person, hopefully in most of the incoming class presidents, editors-in-chief, valedictorians and National Merit Finalists which populate the freshman class at USC.

During my first month at USC, I watched Gilmore Girls on Netflix — all six seasons, with 22 episodes per season. I followed that closely with all seven seasons of the Aaron Sorkin masterpiece The West Wing and all seven seasons of the NBC fan-favorite Parks and Recreation, all in the span of a few short months. As Miley Cyrus would have said, I couldn’t stop, and wouldn’t stop.
College is a time of bingeing. We’ve always known this. College students are notorious for binge-drinking — a national survey published by the National Institute for Health reports that two out of every three college students engaged in binge drinking over the past month. And when freshmen have unlimited access to dining halls, it’s no surprise that the infamy of the Freshman 15 is associated with binge eating habits that carry on throughout college. At this time in our lives, unhealthy habit follows unhealthy habit — and it’s time we realize that cultivating the emotional intelligence that we so often lack is crucial to improving mental health conversations on campus.
Today, we engage in far more than traditional types of bingeing. If my television habits prove anything, it’s that binge watching is an increasingly real phenomenon, recently enabled by decentralized control of television from networks to users. Students even engage in binge studying — all-nighters before tests and stupefying blocks of last-minute cramming all indicate a pattern of studying that neglects the behavior for long stretches of time, then engages in it excessively, all at once.
Psychologists have drawn connections between binge behaviors and those of addiction. A 2003 report entitled “Television Addiction is No Mere Metaphor” published in Scientific American found that users developed addictive behaviors from the use of television as an escape from busy and stress-filled daily life. With the advent of Netflix and HBO Go, this asylum-seeking can last even longer and be more in-depth than ever before.
Moreover, both binge eating and binge drinking are diagnosable disorders that stem from depression, anxiety and stress — the same factors that led Netflix enthusiasts to binge watch television. Catherine Garceau, a former Olympic athlete, told Her Campus that binge eating was a form of escape.
“Because you haven’t figured out other ways to relax yourself in the world, you’re going to use the food to sedate yourself,” Garceau said.
The psychological factors that lead to binge disorders suggest that, as college students, we can’t just pass over our binge behaviors like we do the time between episodes on Netflix. Perhaps these behaviors are indicative of an inability to process stress within a larger culture inundated with constant pressures from social, academic and professional life.
Stress management is nothing new. Today, we thrive — or don’t thrive — in a realm with hundreds of competing priorities, every day. But truly keeping these demands in check comes from more than writing down five goals a day or downloading Google Calendar. Stress management — as a skill — fundamentally comes from emotional intelligence, the ability to process and manage emotions, according to Psychology Today. And unfortunately, though K-12 has taught us how to build traditional “classical” intelligence, many of us lack skills even to assess our own mental health, let alone nurture self-esteem and self-worth.
So it’s this aspect of mental health — the importance of emotional intelligence — that is so often lost on conversations concerning mental well-being on campus. Mindfulness and meditation are important practices, but outside the context of emotional intelligence, their benefits to mental health are limited at best.
Longstanding mental health advocacy — adding more counselors in the Engemann Student Health Center, ensuring mental health professionals are culturally competent and decreasing the stigma of discussing mental health — is crucial to improving resources for students on campus. But the next step is for advocates to critically examine whether the University has created a mechanism to foster longstanding skills that create emotional intelligence. Factoring this aspect into our bigger conversation would demonstrate a commitment to making mental wellness sustainable while students are on campus and for years after they leave the gates of the University.

The Smoke-Free Campus Coalition, which consists of undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff, was formed last fall with the goal of changing USC’s smoking policy to that of a 100 percent smoke- and tobacco-free environment and of promoting a culture of health. In February, the SFCC surveyed the student body in order to ascertain whether or not students were in favor of becoming a smoke-free campus. Of the 3,410 undergraduates who responded, 83 percent supported or were neutral to USC becoming a smoke-free campus. Graduate students showed even more support, with 88 percent of the 2,175 graduate student respondents saying they support or are neutral to such a policy change. And if those statistics aren’t enough, USG’s unanimous vote to pass the Smoke-Free USC Resolution speaks for itself. USC students are ready to go smoke-free.
Students are not the only constituency that supports a smoke-free USC. In November, the Staff Assembly Environment Committee disseminated a survey to USC staff about becoming a smoke-free campus. Of the 2,271 staff that responded, 82 percent supported or were neutral to becoming smoke-free. Faculty members have also shown favor towards updating the policy. Just last week, the Dornsife College Faculty Council voted unanimously to support the Smoke-Free USC Resolution.
The author of the Daily Trojan opinion piece “Does a ban on smoking on USC’s campus really make sense?” raised some concerns about USC going smoke-free that the SFCC would like to address. To start, choosing to use tobacco is a personal choice, not a constitutional right. Every court that has been faced with the issue of whether smoking is a protected right has decided that a fundamental “right to smoke” does not exist so long as a smoking regulation is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. In this case, that purpose is to protect public health and the environment. The implementation of a smoke-free policy does not take away an individual’s right to use tobacco. It simply limits where an individual may use tobacco in order to protect the community’s health.
Although there are currently designated smoking areas on campus, these areas are disregarded by many smokers. Another unfortunate reality is that secondhand smoke does not recognize the existence of these designated areas either. Perimeter policies do nothing to address the risks associated with exposure to secondhand smoke, a toxin which the U.S. Surgeon General has deemed there is no safe level of exposure. Furthermore, perimeter policies do not alleviate the health concerns of those who suffer from asthma attacks, allergies and/or bronchitis, all of which can be triggered by even brief exposure to secondhand smoke. It is imperative that we recognize and respect the health needs of others in our community.
As for chewing tobacco, it is not as harmless as it may first appear. While the use of chewing tobacco may eliminate the problem of secondhand smoke, it still poses a threat to health and the environment. When users of chewing tobacco spit, the chemicals from the tobacco product can end up leaching into the groundwater, or be stepped in and tracked into homes, classrooms, etc., contaminating those environments as well.
USC’s transition to a smoke and tobacco-free environment is long overdue. As of January, there were 1,475 smoke-free college campuses in the United States, and the University has failed to keep pace with its peer institutions on this critical matter of public health. It is time that the University recognizes its responsibility to exercise leadership in the promotion of a healthy, smoke-free environment for all.

Lynn Swann will be the new athletic director at USC, the University announced on Wednesday. Swann will take over in July for Pat Haden, who will step down from the post on June 30.
“To his new role, Lynn Swann will bring the heart and soul of a Trojan,” President C.L. Max Nikias said in a letter to the University. “He shares our profound dedication to combining academic excellence with athletic excellence.”
Swann was a wide receiver on USC’s 1972 undefeated national championship team. In 1973, he served as a team captain and was named a Consensus All-American. He also played on two Rose Bowl teams in his USC career.
Drafted in 1974 by the Pittsburgh Steelers, Swann spent nine seasons in the NFL, where he amassed four Super Bowl rings and was named MVP of Super Bowl X in 1976. He made the Pro Bowl three times and in 1981 was the NFL’s Walter Payton Man of the Year Award winner. Swann, 64, is a member of both of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame.
“This new role as AD fits with my life focus of leadership, mentoring young people, helping others, and giving them the tools they need to grow and achieve,” Swann said in a press release.
After retiring in 1983, Swann went into broadcasting, calling a variety of sporting events for ABC. In 2006, he ran an unsuccessful bid for governor of Pennsylvania as the Republican nominee, where he would have become the state’s first African-American governor.
Swann also served as the chairman of the President’s Council on Physical Fitness from 2002-2005, named to the post by President George W. Bush. He has been on the boards of several companies including Heinz, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Hershey.
Swann, who has a degree from USC in public relations, will now return to run the University’s athletics program.
“I am excited about coming back to USC — its growth and success under President Nikias has been phenomenal and my family and I are looking forward to being a part of that,” Swann said. “As athletic director, my goals for the student-athletes will be to graduate, to win and to experience.”
Swann attended Junipero Serra High School in San Mateo, Calif. where he starred in both football [JUMP] and track and field, winning the long jump title at the CIF California state track and field championships in 1970.
Swann is the third consecutive former USC football player to be named to the athletics director position. Both Haden and his predecessor, Mike Garrett, were well-known ex-players.
Though Swann has experience in athletics, broadcasting, politics and business, he — like Haden and Garrett — has not been involved in athletic administration. He cites his education at USC as a stepping stone for his post-football career.
“USC opened doors for me,” Swann said. “I learned about myself, and my education created a pathway to go forward. I was always looking toward preparing for that career beyond football.”
Haden announced in February that he would retire at the end of June after a five-and-a-half year tenure at the helm. Swann inherits a program in a much more stable position than when Haden took over, with no sanctions imposed and both the head football and basketball coaches — Clay Helton and Andy Enfield — signed to
long-term contracts.
Haden undersaw a rather tumultuous period with the football team under sanctions and controversial head coaches. Haden infamously fired Lane Kiffin in 2013 and relieved Steve Sarkisian of his duties this past season following Sarkisian’s issues with alcohol addiction.
“The Trojan family will be forever grateful to Pat for stewarding USC athletics through some of its most challenging times,” Nikias said.
More than 200 candidates were considered for the position in a search that Nikias stated a few months ago would be “national in scope.”
“The pool was diverse and highly qualified,” Nikias said.
Ultimately, the university once again decided on a familiar face.
Pete Carroll, the popular former head football coach, voiced his support of the hire on Twitter.
“Excited to hear Lynn Swann is the next Athletic Director at USC!” Carroll said. “He will be an outstanding leader and great champion for the Trojan cause!”
Nikias and Swann will hold a press conference on Thursday morning to formally introduce the new athletic director.

This hire makes no sense, but I’ve come to expect that from the USC Administration.
