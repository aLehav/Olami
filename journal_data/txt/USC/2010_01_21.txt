The USC Rossier School of Education will be adding two new master’s programs this fall, targeting specific niches of education.
Education · Rossier officials said they expect their new program in higher education counseling to transform the school’s current program. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
The first, the Master of Arts in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (MAT-ESOL) program, will be a combination of two current programs — the Master of Science in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages and the Master of Education in Teaching English as a Foreign Language — and will be geared toward students who want to learn to teach a language to non-native speakers.
The second new degree, the Master in Higher Education Counseling, will provide students with a route to jobs at 2- and 4-year colleges and universities.
Melora Sundt, associate dean for academic programs of the USC Rossier School of Education, described the change to the language teaching degrees as a philosophical shift for the program.
“Most TESOL programs come out of linguistics and have a strong linguistic approach to them,” Sundt said. “This one now still has some of that, but it’s going to come out of the art of teaching. It’s not just a linguistics-based program, but it’s really trying to drill down into what makes an excellent instructor.”
Though the existing programs were primarily aimed at teaching English to adults, the new program will also focus on educating children.
The new degree will also be offered online for those who want to complete the program outside the classroom. Students who opt to complete the program online would only come to campus for a short residential English language immersion, according to Sundt.
The Masters in Higher Education Counseling degree will specifically focus on community colleges, though it covers all types of higher education, Sundt said.
Currently, USC offers a Master of Education in Postsecondary Administration in Student Affairs, but no postsecondary counseling programs. Sundt said this new degree could be an important one for the Rossier school.
“This gives us a chance to take the strengths of the PASA program and blend it with the strengths of the other two counseling programs to create a program that better meets the needs of people who want to go into student affairs in community colleges,” Sundt said. “California has the largest community college system in the country … It’s a group that we have not been able to serve very well in the past so we’re hoping that this will help.”
Alan Green, associate professor of clinical education, said the field of higher education counseling is growing, particularly in light of President Barack Obama’s focus on the role of community colleges.
This kind of program, he said, is necessary to help prepare graduate students not only to be advisers but also to take on the role of counseling academic or social issues, such as helping students make the transition to college, aiding students in life issues and assisting in career and academic choices.
These changes have been approved within Rossier but not yet by the University Curriculum Committee. Because a whole version of the MAT-ESOL program will be offered online, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, a regional accrediting body, will also have to approve it.
Sundt anticipates a positive student response to the degrees.
“We’ve been asking groups who have worked with our alumni and our alumni themselves about what they think of the idea, and so far the results have been pretty positive,” she said.

Students looking for a weekend activity that doesn’t drain their wallets have always had the option of visiting the California Science Center, which sits just across Exposition Boulevard from USC. But now, a visit that was once free may soon cost a sizable fee.
Free ride · The nearby California Science Center offers free admission to visitors, but Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is considering instituting an admission fee to help bring in more money. The fee could be around $15 for adult visitors. - Vicki Yang | Daily Trojan 
The science center, which aims to educate visitors about math and science, has always been free, but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has proposed adding an admission fee to help bring in more money.
The governor’s plan includes a $12 million budget cut for the museum. The entrance fees would help close this gap.
The new price of admission will most likely be modeled after the fee for the Exploratorium, a science museum in San Francisco that is similar to the California Science Center. The San Francisco museum currently costs $15 for adults and is free for children under the age of 3.
State Sen. Curren Price said imposing an admission fee would be an ill-advised move.
“The new proposal from the governor is calling for a budget reduction of $12 million and asking the science center to make up that shortfall by generating more revenue from admissions,” said Price. “According to the 2005 study, charging for admission would bring the science center less than $1 million a year in net income, far short of the $12 million proposed to be taken out of the science center’s budget.”
Price said he does not think the fee will pass, but he noted that, if it does, it could be disastrous.
“The more you charge, the more attendance drops, negatively impacting our ability to generate revenue and serve economically disadvantaged visitors,” he said.
A similar plan was put forth to the legislature in 2005, and it was rejected. But with the state’s budget at an all-time low, this proposal could help boost the state coffers.
Students said a fee — particularly, a $15 fee — would make them hesitate before visiting the science center.
“One great thing about Los Angeles is that a lot of the museums and other kinds of exhibits are free,” said Neil Sakhrani, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “Although I haven’t been to the science center, the Getty is one of my favorite spots, and I don’t want places like the Getty and the California Science Center to start charging money. It will make people less likely to go to enjoy exhibits and learn.”
Michael Jacobs, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering, said he has been to the center a few times, but, if there is an admission fee, he said he is unsure he would return.
“Although I can see how charging admission would be good for the economy, I don’t think I would pay that much to go back to the science center,” said Jacobs. “$15 is more than it costs to see a movie.”
Some students are not as discouraged about the price change as others.
Mina Gerges, a sophomore majoring in engineering, said he would not stop visiting entirely if a new fee is imposed.
“As an engineering major, I love going to the California Science Center,” said Gerges. “If people in the community really love the science center, then they will support it no matter what.”
Whatever happens, Price said he hopes the science center will not be a victim of the state’s decision.
“The focus of the science center is in inspiring science learning for all, including a large number of youth in the greater Los Angeles area,” said Price. “My hope is that the science center will inspire the learning and imagination of all those who attend, whether it be young children, college students or senior citizens.”

With the 2010 Undergraduate Student Government election season beginning Friday, USG officials are hoping the race will be a little less controversial than last year.
Meeting of the minds · In February, students will have a chance to vote for the next Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president, who will oversee USG’s operations for the next year. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
After a tumultuous election season last year, changes have been applied to the Elections Code to ensure that this year’s race runs smoothly.
“Last year was a total mess,” Emiko Suzuki, co-director of Elections and Recruitment, said. “USG looked bad, the candidates looked bad, everyone was upset that it was happening … We just really want to prevent that.”
During last year’s elections, there were accusations of misconduct among the candidates that lead to the eventual disqualification of one campaign, as well as general confusion among the student body.
This year, the Elections and Recruitment team synchronized the Elections Code with all the other official documents on campus, such as USC Housing rules about posting fliers and the USG bylaws, so there would be fewer contradictions and less confusion with election rules.
“It was just so hectic last year with the Election Code written the way it was,” USG Vice President Ashlie Chan said. “There’s so many things that were tightened up a little bit … We’re really excited because I think it’s going to cause less conflict.”
USG has also removed the volunteer sheets from the process, deciding that they are no longer necessary because they posed possible confusion in usage, Chan said. Last year, anyone who volunteered with a campaign had to turn in a volunteer sheet to the USG office, but the definition of volunteer was unclear and the process was confusing.
“We tried to make it a little bit more clear,” Suzuki said. “Just for it to be more coherent; when you’re reading it you’ll know what the rules are. There aren’t weird loopholes that you can use to attack someone else.”
USG is hoping the new rules and regulations will lead to a calmer, less controversial election period.
“We hope that this year there will be very few complaints and people are just enjoying their time running a campaign,” Suzuki said. “We want everyone to play nice and play fair.”
Some students, however, said it wasn’t just the controversy that kept them from voting last year.
Cara Chang, a junior majoring in kinesiology and biological sciences, said she didn’t vote last year because she didn’t know how.
“I didn’t really care because anything they do doesn’t have much of an effect on me,” she said. “I’m probably not going to vote this year either because it doesn’t seem like it will make much of a difference.”
Some students, however, said they think it is important to vote.
“I think it’s important who runs the school, and if you don’t vote, you never have a say, and when you do vote, it reflects your own values and goals,” said David Alvarez, a sophomore majoring in communication.

In 1997, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave a certain film 11 Oscars — Best Picture included — because it broke box office records, presented dazzling special effects and broke just about everyone’s heart with its true-to-life tragedy.
In reality, however, it was a bad film that has not withstood the test of time.
That film was Titanic, and, if its 11 Oscars are any indication, director James Cameron’s late ‘90s megahit made it easy for everyone — members of the Academy included — to forget all about a small art film also nominated for Best Picture, called L.A. Confidential, which was in fact the best movie of that year.
With last Sunday’s Golden Globes ushering in the 2010 awards season and the Oscars drawing ever closer, strange-yet-familiar circumstances keep developing and, just like in 1997, all of these developments just so happen to include Cameron.
The filmmaker, who has not directed a mainstream film since Titanic, has been quite busy during the last 12 years, working diligently to surpass not only his own colossally successful and award-winning film but also every other film in the history of motion pictures.
With the release of his monumental film Avatar at the end of last year, many believe Cameron has done just that: Box office revenues and many notable film critics seem to constantly justify this very claim.
Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan recently wrote, “Think of Avatar as The Jazz Singer of 3-D filmmaking.” With this bold statement, Turan quite seriously compares Avatar to the 1927 film, which was the first feature-length motion picture to feature synchronized talking and singing.
But it also appears as though the Hollywood Foreign Press Association completely agreed with this stipulation, awarding Cameron’s film with both the Best Picture and Best Director awards, which has now prompted many to believe that Avatar will continue on to the Academy Awards with the same fortune, just like Titanic.
But as a motion picture, does Avatar really deserve all of the praise and awards it has already received and might possibly receive in the future?
An interesting aspect of Turan’s review is that after he compares Cameron’s work to The Jazz Singer, he goes on to add, “Think of [Avatar] as the most expensive and accomplished Saturday matinee movie ever made,” and in labeling it a “matinee movie,” he is completely correct.
As visually stunning as it is, there is no debating the unoriginality of the film’s actual plot. Once you strip away all of the “performance-capture” animation and 3-D special effects, you are left with a bland storyline peopled with characters and featuring dialogue that can be considered both cliché and predictable.
What makes Avatar so great is its visuals, not its overall story. Accordingly, it seems strange that  it was recognized at the Golden Globes to be the Best Picture of 2009.
To qualify as a Best Picture candidate, one would expect a film to excel and amaze in all areas of filmmaking, not just visuals and special effects. Cameron’s film certainly does not do this.
All the same, at this point it is inescapably clear that Avatar will be one of the front-runners in this year’s Academy Award ceremony with not only nominations but also wins. Though he might not make off with 11 Oscars this time around, it is very possible that Cameron will not only take home an Oscar for Best Director but one for Best Picture as well.
If this does happen again, the smaller, less talked about and practically unnoticed film that actually does deserve the bulk of this season’s praise and awards will likely be forgotten because of its less than remarkable showing at the box office.
Director Kathryn Bigelow’s exhilarating film The Hurt Locker, which depicts the intensity of an army bomb squad as they diffuse explosives during the Iraq war, is a great film, but hardly anyone has seen it.
It lacks the mass appeal and stunning visuals that have captivated Avatar’s audiences, but what it does have is state of the art direction, a brilliant script and flawless performances to back it up.
The Hurt Locker constitutes every dimension of exactly what a Best Picture contender should — just like L.A. Confidential did — but there is no way it can compete with the momentum of Avatar.
James Cameron has, in fact, made a ground-breaking film that has changed the presentation of cinema, and like The Jazz Singer — which did not win Best Picture — Avatar deserves to be recognized for how completely it has revolutionized the way audiences experience movies. Still, it should not masquerade as the best film of the past year, let alone all time.
“In reality, however, it was a bad film that has not withstood the test of time.” Surely you jest about Titanic? I’m a man who hardly ever gets emotional watching films, and yet the level this film was able to emotionally reach me is almost embarrassing (only because of the social constructs about men and their feelings). But the point is…it did that to me and to many others with its plot, which speaks volumes about it not being a bad film. “Word of mouth” movies like this become big hits because people spread the word about how great the films are. If it had actually been a bad film, it would have never had the staying power it did; it was not only teenage girls loving this film. I also have high doubts that it would have been nominated for 14 Academy Awards, and won 11 of them. And as far as I can see, this film has stood the test of time, by still making some kind of honorable list and being embraced by a whole new generation. 
But as for Avatar…I basically agree with you. Though I still would not call it a bad film. It simply was not a magical-feeling film.
I couldn’t agree more. Avatar was a movie that was about 2 hours too long. The Hurt Locker was an absoultely stunning movie in all aspects. I saw The Hurt Locker on my flight to Korea this past summer and was moved by the reality of this movie and the strong acting and plot. There is not another movie out this year that compares. It is a sham that The Hurt Locker didn’t win at the Golden Globes and it will not win an Oscar because not many have seen it and it didn’t have the huge budget that Avatar had. This comment coming from someone who couldnt care less about award shows.

Every concert is ultimately an experience-driven event. People might go to a concert to hear the music or to enjoy the venue, but the evening always boils down to the experience. True music lovers enter every concert with certain expectations, and Tuesday night’s White Denim show at the Troubadour was not a regular concert.
Them jeans · White Denim, including bassist Steve Terebecki (above), played a bizarre show at the Troubadour Tuesday night.  - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
The band was already on stage not playing anything at all. Even stranger than that, no one — neither audience nor production team — even cared they were onstage. There were no cheers or drunken shouts of excitement to be heard; people seemed to be concentrating on their own conversations or on getting drinks from the bar.
Gradually the band began to play. They started out quietly, slowly developing the jam into a song. From that moment on, you could feel Denim’s yearning for jam bands. But even as the song began to climax, it was still easy to move closer to the stage. Concertgoers started to be more interested but not as one would expect at a concert. It was as if the Hollywood glamour had stagnated the Troubadour, and it was just another night on Santa Monica Boulevard.
Only around the third or fourth song in the set did people begin to seem genuinely captivated by the performance. At that point, the youthful charm of the Southern virtuosos began to warm the decidedly chilly audience. The blue scales and Southern accents were hypnotizing. The goofy-looking lead singer, the child-like bass player and the cool, scrappy drummer somehow managed to remind the audience not only why they paid to see White Denim but why they loved rock and roll.
Slowly, the band began to feel the love from the tough Hollywood crowd and became more comfortable with its stage presence in the process. White Denim’s classic rock stylings brought people together and ultimately unified them, illustrating through deed why some consider White Denim’s album to be one of the best of 2009.
As the night progressed, the band fell back on some of its catchier tunes like “I Start To Run” and “Mirrored and Reversed,” occasionally weaving in experimental numbers like “El Hard Attack DCWYW” and “Everybody Somebody.”
It’s hard to define White Denim’s musical inclination. It could definitely be said that the band’s head-banging riffs allude to garage rock in the same vein as The Black Keys, but you could also say the group’s songs flow seamlessly from one to the next and go a little bit over the top, like Phish, or pay homage to the psychedelic sounds of the Jimmy Hendrix Experience.
But two things remain constant in White Denim’s sound. One is its clear influence from the sounds of the ‘60s and ‘70s; the other is its virtuosity and comfort with its instruments, being playful and witty at the same time.  Denim is not afraid to improvise, which is key to a band that plays so much blues and soul.
Although the group truly connected with the audience toward the end, the glamour and coolness was too much for this Texan trio at the beginning of the set. Once Denim started to let loose and play their songs, however, they won over the crowd.
Without a doubt, the most exciting part of the night was when the band left the crowd wanting more. The call for an encore was very emotional. The band went to the green room, lit a cigarette and noticed that the audience was shouting and immediately put it out and went back on stage. The ensuing songs completely won everyone’s hearts and turned casual viewers and tagalongs into fans of this up-and-coming band. These three guys were so down-to-earth and accessible they oozed cool, and the fact that they are so talented and entertaining didn’t hurt.
It is clear that White Denim is talented, but it is easy to see that the group is relatively new to touring outside their habitual boundaries. During the show, the band impressed with their virtuosity and captivating blues solos with walls of sound reminiscent of My Bloody Valentines, but, at the end, it was the bands accessibility and friendliness that  won over fans.

The year 2009 was a disappointment for movie lovers. It’s not because there were no good films to be seen — there were quite a few — but overall, most of the big-budget films from well-known directors stumbled, long-running franchises suffered from weak new installments and the good films passed us by unnoticed, lost amid the shuffle of mediocre cinema.
2010 looks much better.
The new year brings with it the promise of new films from creative directors, working in a variety of different genres. There is something for everyone — be they monster movie fans looking for a scary film, superhero fans ready for the next fun blockbuster or laugh-starved moviegoers in need of a legitimately funny comedy. Here are 10 films to definitely go see this year.
Martin Campbell (Casino Royale) brings his 1985 BBC miniseries Edge of Darkness (release date Jan. 29) to the big screen. Now set in Boston, the film stars Mel Gibson as a detective investigating the murder of his activist daughter. The original miniseries was an excellent conspiracy thriller and, with Campbell adapting it with his personal touch, Edge of Darkness looks to be a perfect film for fans of smart mysteries.
There are far too many remakes in Hollywood these days, and most are pointless rehashes that fail to live up to the original. Every so often, however, a remake is just good enough to warrant its existence, like Joe Johnston’s remake of the universal monster movie classic The Wolfman (release date Feb. 12). The cast, which includes Benicio del Toro, Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving, looks amazing, and Rich Baker’s makeup for the Wolfman looks both frightening and realistic. The Wolfman might actually prove scary in the atmospheric, suspenseful way that’s nowhere to be found in the gore fests that seek to pass themselves off as horror films today.
Not as scary but filtered through a layer of gothic weirdness, Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland (release date March 5) offers up a sequel to Lewis Carroll’s classic story, with Alice (Mia Wasikowska) unable to remember her previous adventures. Pulled into Wonderland by the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen) and the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), Alice has to rediscover the magical land and help save the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Visually it’s a treat, and fans of Burton will find it a worthy addition to his filmography.
Those who prefer a more realistic film should check out Green Zone (release date March 12). The creative team behind the last two Bourne films — director Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon — delivers a tale of pre-surge Iraq as a soldier (Damon) gets caught up in a CIA hunt for weapons of mass destruction. Usually movies about the war in Iraq are bogged down by political messages and weak storylines, but Green Zone looks to be an excellent action thriller that uses its setting to tell a story, not to preach a message.
For those not into action and politics, I Love You Phillip Morris, (release date March 26) is the film to see. A very true story, the film stars Jim Carrey as the gay con artist Stephen Russell, a man who embezzled thousands, was arrested, fell in love with fellow inmate Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor) and escaped jail numerous times. Carrey abandons his usual slapstick for a more subdued take but still gives his funniest performance in a long time.
While the 1980s T.V. show The A-Team is getting a film adaptation this year, it won’t be the year’s best ex-special forces movie. That honor goes to The Losers (release date April 9), an adaptation of the Vertigo comic book series created by Andy Diggle and Jock. Set up by their superiors, a left-for-dead CIA team declares war on the agency. The source material is smart, action-packed and inventive, and the cast — which includes Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Chris Evans and Idris Elba — looks talented enough to make this a strong adaptation.
Everyone’s favorite sarcastic, hard-drinking superhero is back in Iron Man 2 (release date May 7). Picking up where the last film left off, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) must deal with the repercussions of revealing his secret identity, a decision with fallout coming in the form of both congressional hearings and new enemies out to destroy him. Fans of Marvel’s film line will enjoy the build up to The Avengers film with Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and new cast members Don Cheadle and Mickey Rourke only add to the appeal of the film.
But without a doubt, the best film of the year looks to be Inception (release date July 16), written and directed by Christopher Nolan, the man behind Memento, The Prestige and the revitalized Batman franchise. All that is known about the film is that it involves the blackmailing of a CEO, but the trailers have involved gravity-defying fights, cities folding over on themselves and a large amount of water imagery. Add in Nolan’s cast, which includes Leonardo DiCaprio and Ken Watanabe as the leads, and Inception looks ready to be a mind-bending cinematic experience, if not the highlight of the cinematic year.
Switching gears from drama to comedy is The Social Network (release date Oct. 15), David Fincher’s (Fight Club, Se7en) new film that memorializes the true story of the creation of Facebook. Part biopic, part comedy, The Social Network stars Jesse Eisenberg as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, with Justin Timberlake as his business partner. The premise is certainly unique, and Fincher’s direction plus the always funny Eisenberg make The Social Network a must-see for anyone who logs on to Facebook.
Ending the year on a quirky note, Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Be Kind Rewind) offers up a modern day adaptation of the radio and television hero in The Green Hornet (release date Dec. 22). While it’s a bit hard to picture Seth Rogen as the Green Hornet, the released pictures look promising, and Jay Chou’s filmography makes him a worthy successor to Bruce Lee for the role of the Hornet’s martial artist sidekick Kato. Plus, it is the first film to feature Christoph Waltz since his breakout role in 2009’s Inglourious Basterds.

¡No lo puedo creer! It’s only Jan. 21 and we’ve already reached the point in the year when it has become need to consult the sage wisdom of Cher Horowitz to deal with the wretched state of the world at large has become unavoidable. Alicia Silverstone’s Cher, the natural blonde prophet of 1995’s Clueless, had this to say about providing aid to desperate Haiti-ans [sic]:
“The Haiti-ans need to come to America. But some people are all, ‘What about the strain on our resources?’ Well, it’s like when I had this garden party for my father’s birthday, right? I put R.S.V.P. ‘cause it was a sit-down dinner. But some people came that, like, did not R.S.V.P. I was, like, totally buggin’. I had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food and squish in extra place settings. But by the end of the day it was, like, the more the merrier. And so if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange some things, we could certainly party with the Haiti-ans.” 
What do you take away from that? I interpret it as an unqualified appeal to the American people — a people of significantly greater means and resources than the quake-ravaged and desperate Haitians to the south — to sacrifice what we can for the benefit of those whose present situation is far more dire than our own. Additionally, isn’t it telling how much more willing we are to act as an international police force than an international emergency response crew? Cher was aware of that, and in her impassioned address to her colleagues in afternoon speech class, she espoused (in an admittedly roundabout fashion) a simple policy of doing what you can.
This is where it gets Lifestylish, I promise; Lady Gaga, a fake blonde prophet from the current millennium, is making some high-profile strides to provide aid to the survivors of last week’s Caribbean shake-down (I hope that doesn’t sound too much like a cocktail: no disrespect or belittlement intended). In her Jan. 15 appearance on Oprah, M’Lady declared Jan. 24 “Gaga For Helping Haiti Day.”
Awkwardly phrased but well meaning, the part-online, part-in-person event this coming Sunday will likely generate a windfall of financial assistance for the Haitian situation (again, no levity was meant by the rhyme). As it’s worded on her website in a barrage of capitals that would make Kanye proud, “PROCEEDS FROM ALL MERCHANDISE PURCHASED ON LADYGAGA.COM ON THIS DATE WILL GO DIRECTLY TO HAITIAN EARTHQUAKE RELIEF. FOR MONSTERS ATTENDING THE MONSTER BALL IN NYC THAT EVENING, PROCEEDS FROM ALL TICKET SALES & MERCH SOLD WILL ALSO BE DONATED TO THE CAUSE.”
A special shirt has even been created for the occasion. Admittedly, there have been more beauteous things designed, but Gaga’s just doing what she can to help out her monsters in need.
Cher would be proud.
It’s a comfort to know that so much attention is being brought to the disaster in Haiti. With so much news about the economy and war saturating the media, it’s more than important to keep in mind the true crises. Excellently written article.

A USC coach poking fun at himself for charity.
No sorry to disappoint you Trojan Nation, but it’s not current coach Lane Kiffin. Unfortunately he is still involved in a scandal over a damaged Tennessee-owned Lexus.
So while we wait for the stench of car scandals and allegations of recruitment violations to slowly leave the USC campus, what better moment to latch on one last time to the good-natured man we called our coach for nine years, Pete Carroll.
While Carroll has already started his new lavish job in Seattle, a place that ironically has had far less rain than Southern California this past week, the former-USC coach still found time to cleverly promote a charity event for his foundation A Better LA.
In the promotional video/comedy sketch for FunnyorDie.com, Carroll teams up with funny man Rob Riggle (The Hangover) and actress Aubrey Plaza (Funny People) in a three minute piece that not only generates a few laughs but benefits a great cause.
In the video, Riggle plays an eccentric/desperate Trojan football fan trying to urge Carroll to remain as the play caller for USC. From playing the fight song on a boom box outside the coach’s house, to joking that Seattle fans won’t appreciate his abilities because all they are a bunch of fanatical supporters of the hit show Frasier, the comedic actor steals the show, but in the end it’s Carroll who still shines brightest.
While the coach’s lines are few and far between (and to be honest are completely matter of fact), the video is just another example of why the Los Angeles community has embraced him so much: his propensity to take part in jest, even if it’s at his expense.
The benefit for Carroll’s A Better LA will take place on Feb.20 at LA Live, and will feature guests Will Ferrell, Tenacious D, Demitri Martin, Nick Swardson and Riggle. In addition to benefiting his foundation, all ticket proceeds from their buy one get one free special this weekend will go directly to The Red Cross and their efforts in Haiti.
Though I don’t see an acting career for Carroll when his days as a coach wind down, even though his time at USC is no more, you can’t help but root for the guy, who — more than calling plays and motivating his players — touches lives with his big heart.
No typically I send them out to friends and family though…

Oh my god you guys! Justin Bieber is totally dead! It’s true! I read it online.
I also read that Taylor Lautner, Natalie Portman, George Clooney and basically every other celebrity has recently died in freak accidents, horrible crimes or mournful suicides. It seems that pop culture has taken our obsession with two of life’s biggest mysteries — death and fame — and created a new monster: celebrity death hoaxes.
Perhaps it is our need to hold on to the magic of our idols in any way we can after their deaths that has led us to the current state of affairs on the Internet. It is a new trend of sorts that leaves many celebrities wondering if today is the day they will be killed off by some kid in Nebraska looking to play a trick on his friends. People are using social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as supposedly reputable online news forums like CNN’s iReport, to spread rumors of fake celebrity deaths, and they are becoming increasingly frequent.
Daily Trojan | Thomas Curry
Spreading fake rumors of celebrity deaths seems to give the gossips a momentary taste of power. Zach Braff fell victim to the trend last October when a fake CNN page announced the actor’s untimely demise. Shortly after, news of Braff’s passing was all over Twitter, causing him to post a YouTube response to dispel the rumor. Though perhaps posting a fake celebrity death announcement could create the same thrill of wrongdoing arsonists feel, but it is a dangerous game to play. Not all of the rumors are dispelled quickly enough to prevent the star’s friends, family and fans from becoming scared and hurt.
Celebrities will always be chased by paparazzi, approached for autographs in public and have to hire
publicists to deny their wrongdoings. Now, it seems they will also have to make more frequent appearances to ward off fans’ fears of their untimely departure. But hey, there is an upside — once you have been declared dead on the Internet, you really know you’ve made it.
The real concern, then, is not about the well-being of celebrities. It is about those individuals who are abusing the power of the web to spread false fear into the hearts of teen girls and Perez Hilton devotees, as well as those who ignorantly fall victim to the bloggers’ lies.
The concept of news in our generation has been distorted and manipulated to serve those people who wish to play practical jokes on attractively large audiences. The Internet is not at all trustworthy — anything posted
online has to be triple-checked for accuracy, and even then many tricksters have become hardened enough to
create a false trail of reference sites to support their absurd claims. CNN’s site allows anyone to post content online as a purported means of spreading news quickly — to be fair, iReport was the first to post cell phone videos of the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007. The combination of accurate news and cleverly disguised fabrications, however, is messy and confusing, and it ultimately points to a future of citizen-run news sites lacking the credibility of a reliable source.
The Internet provides the perfect playground for those who wish to feels a false sense of power shrouded in anonymity. After all, anyone on the Internet can have a voice, and people will listen. But if the Internet’s ability to spread news quickly and effectively is exploited to cause distress over the deaths of celebrities, it seems pertinent to
wonder how the web will be misused next.

As if last week’s earthquake didn’t rattle Haiti enough, the country endured severe aftershocks this week while Guatemala, Venezuela and Argentina were shaken by earthquakes of their own. These natural disasters continue to be a focal point for headlines, and the frustrations that accompany the unfathomable loss and the difficulties of providing aid to the torn country of Haiti persist.

The media has been chronicling the progress and predicaments that follow disaster — the primary problem being the lack of clean water and food supplies. Another problem has arisen, however, that is of a more societal nature.
In Haiti, looters have been going on sprees through home goods stores, the Marché  Hyppolite market and debris strewn streets, rummaging for food and other supplies. The police, aid workers and other survivors perceive looters as threats to the already-desperate Port-au-Prince as they take unfair advantage of the vulnerability of the situation and disrupt the relief efforts being made in the capital. Furthermore, they display blatant disregard for corpses that are strewn about, clawing past them in order to obtain valuable goods in a savage fashion.
The problem of looters is considered a severe hurdle in achieving effective distribution of aid — they unfairly hoard resources, depriving those who follow the law of much needed aid. Compounding this issue is the fact that the Haitian police have had trouble keeping peace and order in the capital. Police have opened fire on a number of Haitians found to be looting, with at least one incident caught on video.
Ten days after the quake, patience is wearing thin.
In addition, the media divides Haitians into two discrete camps — survivors, painted as courageous and strong-willed women and children, and looters, who appear to be selfish, Hobbesian outlaws. But to be fair, looters are survivor, too. That said, the police’s open fire on these survivors prompts some unusual questions about the justness of the response.
Though they may technically be considered “looters” in that they are stealing things found among the ruins, it’s difficult to simply discount them as criminals. Such a violent response to the behavior seems neither necessary nor fair. Opening fire on the looters only succeeds in stemming that particular riot but does not prevent future incidents. During dire times, a nasty, brutish state of nature becomes the standard, and it’s every man for himself.
Don’t desperate times call for desperate measures?
Hye You| Daily Trojan
Of course, Haiti’s case is an unusual one — there is no government in sight, yet the law enforcers are still at work.
“The big question is, ‘Who’s in charge?’” former Haitian Prime Minister Michèle Pierre-Louis said. “We don’t feel as though there is someone organizing all this.”
Pierre-Louis is right. Haitian President René Préval waited until Jan. 20th to address the distraught island nation — eight full days after the earthquake. Haiti is now reliant on international aid, which simply doesn’t seem to be funneling into the country fast enough. Quasi-anarchy might indeed be brewing in the Haitian capital, as there is no proper authority or government arranging the relief efforts.  Government officials have gone under the radar since the collapse of the presidential palace, a haunting metaphor for a government gone defunct. And in place of that government, the local police, coupled with international troops and aid workers, have swooped in, creating a tense environment that has exacerbated a myriad of other post-quake problems faced by Haitians.
Taking all this into consideration, perhaps it’s wrong to accuse the police of unnecessary and unjust violence. Their intention is to quell the violence in hopes of securing stability so that organized action can take place. In the midst of this apparent lawlessness and widespread loss, a sense of order may be the most sought-after commodity.
But while there is certainly a need to restore and maintain order, using violence might not be the solution. Though such a perspective would be different had we, say, been looted ourselves, it simply does not seem fair to punish people for using their survival instincts. In reality, especially in the absence of a functioning government, each person will take steps to stay alive by any means necessary.
In ordinary circumstances, lawlessness is inexcusable. But when survivors are rummaging for food, displaying “barbaric” behavior borne of necessity and met with gruesome endings, that in itself, should be considered problematic.

Great perspective! It’s always hard to believe you’re only 19.
I disagree!   There is no excuse for violence.  If ever there was a time to come together and share it was after the tragedy.

Former football coach Pete Carroll’s reach spanned much farther than just the football field.
During his time in Los Angeles, Carroll founded A Better LA — a community outreach program that works with inner-city groups to decrease violence. Despite announcing his resignation as USC’s head coach last week, Carroll intends to remain active in the community and will continue to be dedicated to the cause.

A Better LA currently targets the community of West Athens but serves the entire South Los Angeles area through its work with inner-city groups to stop violence in the community at large.
“We build happiness from within,” said Executive Director Brian Center, repeating the group’s slogan. “We take a community that’s been struggling, all the struggles that that community goes through, and take a complete approach to help that community.”
Though Carroll will be moving to Seattle, Center believes his devotion to Los Angeles’ at-risk youth will remain.
“He’s still going to be there for us,” Center said. “His involvement will be similar. At the very least, he’ll stay on our board and help us raise dollars, just like he’s always been.”
A Better LA depends heavily on its relationships with other inner-city outreach groups, who also agree that Carroll’s leaving will not have a negative impact on the foundation.
“[A Better LA]’s still going to have an impact on the community,” said Reynaldo Reaser, director of operations for Common Unity Reaching Everyone, one of A Better LA’s partners. “Regardless of where Pete is, he’s still going to be the man of A Better LA.”
C.U.R.E is also focused on preventing gang violence in the community of West Athens and has successfully created a brotherhood between rival gangs in one of Los Angeles’ most violent gang territories.
Reaser said despite Carroll’s resignation, his organization is fully committed to maintaining its partnership with A Better LA.
“We’re partnered — that’s a done deal,” said Reaser. “We’re not going anywhere.”
Currently, A Better LA is putting on a comedy show titled Make it Better with proceeds going directly to the organization. The show, taking place at the Nokia Theater on Feb. 20, will be headlined by Will Ferrell and includes performances by Demetri Martin, Tenacious D and more. Carroll’s name remains on top of the flier.
Though many people are upset at Carroll for leaving USC, Center says they shouldn’t be.
“If people could spend time with him, they would see how sincere he is,” Center said.

Long lines at the bookstore and high textbook prices could eventually be a thing of the past thanks to a California bill that will require universities to offer texts through electronic readers such as the Kindle or the Nook.
Senate Bill 48 adds a section to the California Education Code, mandating that all textbooks be offered “in whole or in part” through electronic readers by 2020. Initially, the bill only targeted public colleges, but it was amended to include private universities as well. The bill is aimed at lowering the financial burden of buying textbooks. Though students will be required to purchase an electronic reader to access these texts and may run into additional fees, the overall costs will be less than buying traditional textbooks.
Smart shoppers · A state bill mandates that schools provide an option for students to buy textbooks on electronic readers, allowing them to avoid the bookstore and potentially save money. - Heather Lee | Daily Trojan 
Susan Metros, USC’s deputy chief information officer and associate vice provost for technology-enhanced learning, said USC is already exploring alternative ways to offer textbooks.
“Our faculty are looking closely at electronic textbooks as an alternative, when appropriate, to replace print,” said Metros, who is also a professor of visual design and clinical education.
She noted that current digital readers lack some of the capabilities necessary to display textbooks.
“There are issues with the first generation of readers and the content that they support,” she said.
Despite the push from the state to increase access via digital readers, Director of the USC Bookstores Daniel Archer said the core issue is lowering costs, whether through electronic readers or some other medium.
“To me, the larger issue is how we control cost,” Archer said. “The bookstore, for the last 20 years, has been on this path of migration. There have been so many movements to try to nip the price problem in the bud.”
Though the increase in digital textbooks might cause a decrease in textbook sales at the bookstore, Archer said the bookstore would be able to fill any missing revenue with other products, such as those offered in the basement of the store.
Still, Archer said he does not think the bill will have much of an impact, he believes students prefer reading texts in print. He added that the bookstore is already looking at other ways to keep costs down, including relying more on custom publishing.
Though students supported the effort to decrease textbook costs, most thought the bill would be better if the texts could be viewed on a computer, so they could be printed.
“In one of my [communication] classes the professor told us there was no need to buy the textbook because all of the readings were going to be articles she was going to send us,” said Laura Escobar-Vallecillo, a sophomore majoring in communication. “It made me really happy because it was an $100 textbook.”
She added that she still prefers printed texts.
Samuel Treviño, a freshman majoring in archeology, said he enjoys using online sources in his classes, but he also likes to interact with textbooks by writing in and highlighting them.
“I think as long as students have the option to have the physical textbook too, [this bill] would be fine with me,” Treviño said.

As the USC men’s basketball team returns to the friendly confines of the Galen Center for a two-game homestand, the Trojans will first play host on Thursday to a team that has encountered much of the same success as the Trojans.
Addition · The Trojans have compiled a 5-2 record since sophomore forward Lenoard Washington returned to the team just before Christmas. - Avi Kushlan | Daily Trojan 
While the Washington State Cougars (13-5, 3-3) still have the opportunity to play in the postseason, its up-and-down performance in conference play mirrors that of the Trojans’ (11-6, 3-2) thus far.
Sitting in fourth place in the Pac-10, the Cougars have bolstered their record with wins over Arizona and Stanford but have failed to perform against some of the more successful teams in the conference, falling to California at home and getting blown out by Arizona State on the road.
USC can certainly relate; only days after sweeping the Arizona schools at home, the team faltered on the road, losing to Stanford at the buzzer and to Cal by eight points. They recently rebounded  by overwhelming UCLA at Pauley Pavilion 67-46, which moved the Trojans into a two-way tie for second place in the conference.
“We only have 13 games left to play, and we need to give our best effort every single time we play those games,” O’Neill said. “We’re 3-2 in the league, and we’re just trying to get to 4-2. Take it one game at a time and see where it goes.”
The key to the Cougars’ success this season has come in the form of sophomore guard Klay Thompson ,who averaged 22.9 points and 5.1 rebounds per game, and freshman guard Reggie Moore, who averages 13.4 points and 4.6 assists. They will square off against the Trojans’ experienced tandem of seniors point guard Mike Gerritty and guard Dwight Lewis, who have played increasingly vital roles since Gerrity’s introduction to the team one month ago.
“We played a lot of good offensive teams … we’ve got to do the same job against [the Cougars] tomorrow as we did against them,” O’Neill said. “They are a team that generates a lot of offense out of early stuff and second shots. It’s a necessity that we play great defense. Because of the way we’ve competed and played hard, we’ve put ourselves in a position to be a good team that way.”
Despite the similarities between the teams, the location of the game seems to play into USC’s favor beyond simply having the home crowd behind it.
The Cougars have had major struggles playing on the road, and it seems to be a deeper problem than their 2-3 record indicates: Washington State has been beaten by a total of 47 points in its three losses, and its best road win was a two-point victory over 9-9 Arizona.
Meanwhile, the Trojans have found continued success at the Galen Center and now have a 7-2 record that includes wins over then-No. 8 Tennessee and Arizona State.
Nevertheless, O’Neill sees every game as equal, stressing that the absence of a postseason for the Trojans has only made games more significant.
“I’m approaching every game for us like its a postseason game, because we don’t have a postseason,” said O’Neill. “For us, what’s important is we don’t waste any days, cause this group’s only going to play together for 13 more games.”

With one of the largest single donations to a dental school in history, the USC School of Dentistry has become the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC, named after alumnus and benefactor Dr. Herman Ostrow.
All smiles · President Steven B. Sample, donor and alumnus Herman Ostrow and school of dentistry Dean Avishai Sadan announced the naming of the dental school today in front of a crowd of more than 400. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
Ostrow, who graduated from the school of dentistry in 1945, donated $35 million to name the school of dentistry, President Steven B. Sample announced Wednesday before a crowd of more than 400 people. The donation makes the school of dentistry the 11th school  at USC to be named and the eighth named during Sample’s presidency.
“This announcement promises to solidify the dentistry school’s stature amongst the nation’s elite dental schools, and it will touch the lives of all who study, teach, work and receive oral health care at USC,” Sample said when the gift was announced.
The $35 million will be used as an endowment, Dean Avishai Sadan said. He told the crowd that the donation and the naming represents the strong attachment alumni feel to their alma mater.
“The naming of a school signifies the highest bond between a school and a donor whose philanthropic act enabled the promotion of the school’s vision and mission in perpetuity,” Sadan said.
Sample described the announcement as one of the most significant in USC history. Sadan had similar praise for Ostrow’s gift.
“His amazing act of generosity will prove to be transformative for the university,” he said.
The naming of the dental school is just one of many recent changes at the school. Earlier this year, the school welcomed Sadan as the new dean, and it is currently working on upgrading its clinic.
Current dentistry students are well aware of the strides the school has been making and of the impact Ostrow’s large gift will have.
“Usually large donations take a long time to develop, so it probably won’t happen in our time here, but it will provide at least a history that we can be proud of even after we leave here,” said Daniel Mease, a third-year dentistry student. “Even though we might not see it ourselves, it will at least benefit the students who are under us.”
Andy Yu, a third-year dentistry student, said the gift not only represents the potential for future growth but also reflects the school’s history.
“It shows there’s a powerful foundation of alumni that our school has created and it shows the integrity and how dedicated our alumni are to our school, so it’s just a wonderful example of how they can keep supporting our school,” Yu said.
