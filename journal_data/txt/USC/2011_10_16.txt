With 30 years of AIDS and HIV research in the books, the Los Angeles and USC communities hope to stay at the forefront of research development through community involvement and a continued strive toward treating the disease.

This much was clear Sunday as an estimated 30,000 people walked the streets of Hollywood as part of AIDS Walk Los Angeles. Participants included community members and USC leaders in the field of AIDS research and development.
AIDS Project Los Angeles Executive Director Craig E. Thompson said although USC has been heavily involved in treating HIV/AIDS patients, it was not until the last decade that USC increased its focus on AIDS research.
“As a research university, USC has always been slower to move into doing HIV and AIDS research than some of the other universities, but is really stepping that up now and we are really pleased to see that,” Thompson said.
The USC community has had strong involvement in research concerning the disease ever since Michael Gottlieb, then a 33-year-old assistant professor at the UCLA medical center, first described AIDS in 1981.
Today, more than 30 million people worldwide live with either HIV or AIDS, according to a study by AVERT, a worldwide AIDS and HIV charity.
To commemorate the 30th year of strong academic and medical attention to the disease, the USC Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research hosted a daylong symposium last week where doctors from USC and other universities around the country discussed the future of research in the field.
USC’s increased recognition of the importance of the disease in the research community signaled to Rep. Adam Schiff  that USC, and other universities, will take a leading role in the years to come.
“Some of the most path-breaking research is done at our institutions of higher learning,” Schiff said. “So USC just needs to keep up the great work it’s doing, and at the Federal level we need to make sure that the funds for research at [the National Institute of Health] are continued and continue to support the pipeline of brilliant work being done at USC.”
Student groups at USC are also looking to the USC community as a place for support for AIDS research and patients. Connie Chen, a junior majoring in international relations (global business) and president of the USC chapter of Face AIDS, an on-campus AIDS support organization, sees a bright future for involvement at USC.
“There is a lot of interest in AIDS groups [at USC],” Chen said. “It’s just so easy to get involved.”
Face AIDS also recently partnered with APLA to help increase awareness and support opportunities around USC.
For Thompson, with the changing demographic of the AIDS epidemic and USC’s geographic location, the university is poised to stay at the forefront of the fight against the disease.
“USC [is] uniquely positioned to take a leadership position in South Central. [It] has not been the hardest hit [community], but the epicenter [of the AIDS epidemic] is moving to South Los Angeles,” Thompson said. “USC could be poised to do more with services and things out of the campus or related to the campus because Jefferson Park is right there.”

Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of President C. L. Max Nikias assuming his presidency at USC.
Achievements ·Since taking office last year, President C. L. Max Nikias has strengthened the school’s athletic compliance standards. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan
“Niki and I feel deeply honored to serve as president and first lady of this great university,” Nikias said in a statement issued to the Daily Trojan. “This has been a truly extraordinary year for us, and as a community, we can celebrate a number of significant successes.”
The university has seen a great deal of  financial development since Nikias’ inauguration. In the last 12 months, USC raised an unprecedented $1 billion, launched the largest fundraising campaign in the history of higher education, advanced medical research and education, and welcomed its most international freshman class to date.
The university also broke ground on a new university health center and athletics complex and raised and strengthened athletic compliance standards.
James G. Ellis, dean of the Marshall School of Business, said Nikias’ leadership helps the university flourish.
“President Nikias has become an exemplary leader of a world class university,” Ellis said in an email. “He sets the tone for all of us with his work ethic, his values, and his ability to accomplish all he does with a smile and a kind word for everyone.”
Yannis C. Yortsos, dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering, praised Nikias for the leadership and energy he has shown during his first year.
“He started with the explosive energy we all expected and has surpassed all expectations in the momentum he has created for this university,” Yortsos said in a press release.
Undergraduate Student Government President Monish Tyagi said while President Nikias has done a tremendous job in his first year, what has been especially unique about his presidency is the importance he places on connecting with students.
“In the midst of all of the things he has to do and the demand in his schedule — the fact that he has time to engage with students speaks a lot to [his character],” Tyagi said. “He hosts monthly teas where he interacts with students, meets with our student government a few times a semester and he is very student-friendly.”
Tyagi said Nikias is known to have said, “Without students, this wouldn’t be a university; it would just be a research center.”
Nikias focused on encouraging students to engage with the community,  to have a stronger social experience and to have a richer academic experience during his first year, Tyagi said.
“He always talks about how to get students involved in the community,” Tyagi said. “He’s been working with Provost [Garrett] to emphasize making USC a home for students, through creating residential colleges that provide more of a wholesome experience for freshmen. [He has also continued working on] improving the overall academic experience, from recruiting the best faculty members in the world to getting new facilities.”
Some students said they were happy with the changes they’ve seen Nikias implement in his first year and are excited to see how the university continues to evolve under his leadership.
“Nikias has truly re-established the foundation [on] which our university is based and I’m incredibly excited to see how the fundraising will better every aspect of the university,” said Yimu Xue, a junior majoring in communication.
Monroe Ekilah, a sophomore majoring in computer science and computer engineering, said Nikias has raised the university’s profile through the Campaign for the University of Southern California.
“If the goal is achievable, [Nikias’ campaign] would be unprecedented for the university, as well as the surrounding community, since a portion of that money goes beyond USC as well,” Ekilah said. “He’s already raised more than a billion dollars within a year, which really reflects well on the university.”
Christopher Organ, a junior majoring in international relations (global business) and East Asian languages and cultures, said although Nikias has done a good job overall, his leadership could focus more on updating existing campus facilities.
“Leavey Library doesn’t necessarily reflect the quality of the university or other buildings,” Organ said. “If USC [were] to focus on facilities that students use the most, it would make more of a tangible impact on students’ daily lives.”
Nikias focused on encouraging students to engage with the community,  to have a stronger social experience and to have a richer academic experience during his first year, Tyagi said.
“He always talks about how to get students involved in the community,” Tyagi said. “He’s been working with Provost [Garrett] to emphasize making USC a home for students, through creating residential colleges that provide more of a wholesome experience for freshmen. [He has also continued working on] improving the overall academic experience, from recruiting the best faculty members in the world to getting new facilities.”
WHAT DOES ANY OF THIS HAVE TO DO WITH WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY?????? HIS IDEA OF ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY IS BULLDOZING LOCAL HOMES AND HISTORIC LANDMARKS TO MAKE WAY FOR MORE USC PROFIT.
Lots of fancy language with little substance or concrete examples to explain how Nikias is benefiting the community or even the university…all I have seen is reduction of campus workers’ rights/wages and a complete neglect of the local community while revenue reaches historic peaks.
Dear “Logic and Reason”:
What examples can you give of Nikias encouraging the bulldozing of local homes and historic landmarks?  If you want to have a logical and reasonable discussion about Nikias, and more broadly, USC’s relations with its neighbors, by all means lets do so, but your first comment gives nothing to substantiate your claims.
And what do you mean by “complete neglect of the local community”?
USC should – and DOES! – work with the community in many, many ways – from partnerships with local schools and organizations, to raising money for community service efforts through the Good Neighbors campaign, to supporting local business initiatives to give favorable purchasing to small business in the area, to many other efforts. Although the University’s first responsibility is to its students, staff, faculty, and facilities, it has done an excellent job of listening and partnering where it can with neighbors. Can more be done? Yes. But the University isn’t responsible for everything that happens in the community, and it can’t take care of things that are the duty of local government and neighbors themselves (like street and neighborhood upkeep). 
Could you respond to these points?
I whole heartedly agree that existing facilities definitely need to be renovated. Levy should be the first.

For a team that’s been waiting more than a month for a win, what’s another 85 minutes?
After sophomore forward Elizabeth Eddy scored in the fifth minute, that’s how long the USC women’s soccer team had to wait before the final whistle blew on its first victory since Sept. 4.
That’s not to say the Women of Troy’s (4-11, 1-5) win over Washington on Friday wasn’t stressful.
Senior midfielder Brittany Kerridge got the assist of Eddy’s goal — her sixth assist of the season and 12th of her career, moving her into the top-10 in USC’s all-time career assist list.
“I can’t say enough about her performance,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “She’s been so consistent throughout her four years here. She’s just so solid and dependable. [She] makes my job easy as a coach.”
Apart from that lone goal, the game was largely dominated by the Huskies (6-6-3, 2-3-1).
“The game felt like an eternity,” Khosroshahin said. “Especially the last 10 seconds. They took forever.”
There was a mad scramble in the USC penalty box for the last seconds of the game, but unlike in previous games, the USC defense held strong.
“Relieved,” Khosroshahin said of his feelings after the game. “It hasn’t been an easy season for us. Our record really isn’t a good indicator of this team. It was good to prove that to ourselves.”
In a change from what has been the pace all season, it was USC who found itself on the short end of almost every stat category. The Women of Troy were outshot, drew fewer corner kicks and had fewer Khosroshahin.
But they found themselves on top of the scoreboard at the end of the game.
“It was 100 percent [ours] to win,” Khosroshahin said. “[We] came out very, very strong in the second half. [Washington] hit a post and we sorta shrunk back, not wanting to concede a goal.”
Goalposts have not been the Women of Troy’s friends this year, often redirecting their own shots out and their opponent’s shots in.
“First time this whole year that the other team hits a post and it went out and not in,” Khosroshahin said.
Freshman goalie Carley Pennington got her first career start and played all 90 minutes in place of usual starter sophomore Shelby Church, who has been suspended indefinitely. Church and junior midfielder Courtney Garcia were officially suspended Monday for a “violation of team rules,” Khosroshahin said. “And I can’t comment on that any further.”
Khosroshahin said both players will be out for the remainder of the season, which continues next weekend as the Women of Troy host Arizona State on Friday and Arizona on Sunday for senior day.
great  win.  Now lets parlay that to wins this weekend.
Hang in their Coach Ali, things will get much better soon!
Fight On,
Tommy

It took all four periods of regulation, two overtime periods and sudden death, but the No. 4 USC men’s water polo team got a win nonetheless in a 9-8 victory over No. 2 California on Saturday in Berkeley, Calif.
The Trojans improved to 12-2 and 3-0 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play against the Golden Bears (14-3, 2-1). A goal in sudden death notched by sophomore two-meter Jeremy Davie off an assist by sophomore driver Nikola Vavic with six seconds left in the three-minute sudden death round secured the narrow win for the Trojans.
“It’s not unfamiliar for us to be in sudden death,” Davie told USCTrojans.com. “The pressure is good but it’s pretty stressful. [There was] not much time left on the clock, making a back door move, and just hoping for a miracle move and Nikola as usual provides.”
Cal took a 2-0 lead over USC at the beginning of the first period thanks to a 6-on-5 and a 5-meter penalty shot. USC answered with a pair of goals of its own from sophomore utility Mace Rapsey and senior driver Peter Kurzeka. With the score tied 2-2, The Golden Bears came back to score another goal on a 6-on-5 and captured their first goal of the game as well.
The score then 4-2, the Trojans replied to the Golden Bears’ fire with some heat of their own. Redshirt junior driver Forest Monroe took advantage of a USC 6-on-5 to up the score 4-3, and a goal from junior driver Tobias Preuss pulled the two teams even at 4-4 by the end of the half.
On the defensive side, resolute blocking from senior goalie Joel Dennerley, who secured 15 saves throughout the course of the game, aided the Trojan defense in stopping Cal’s forceful offense.
“Joel is a brick wall, you cannot  get a shot past that guy … and I’m sure every player in the country is afraid of shooting on him,” Davie said.
USC took its first lead of the game when Vavic notched a goal, thanks to an assist from Kurzeka, making it 5-4. Cal would get even with the Trojans, but two more USC goals, the first from Davie and the second from Preuss, made for a 7-5 USC lead with 2:44 left in the third period.
After two more goals from Cal, on its next possession and early in the fourth period — leaving the score at 7-7 at the end of the fourth — the game went into overtime.
The first overtime period saw the Golden Bears secure a point with less than 20 seconds left, Rapsey found Davie in the second overtime period, however, and the score was evened out at 8-8 as the game entered its sudden death round.
Davie’s last-minute goal in sudden death was his third of the game and exactly what USC needed to finally put a stop to Cal, leading to a final score of 9-8.
USC’s win gives the team hope that it might reclaim its No. 1 ranking.
“Stanford lost [this weekend] so that puts Cal and Stanford both at three losses and us and UCLA at two, so it’ll be interesting to see when the rankings come out,” Davie said. “Hopefully we’ll be back at number one.”
The Trojans will face No. 5 UC Santa Barbara in Santa Barbara, Calif., on Sunday.
Wonderful win!  As we were there, FYI, it was Michael Rosenthal who scored the first goal, not Mace…. but the entire team played hard and smart and we look forward to an exciting rest of the season.
this says it was Mace Rapsey: http://www.usctrojans.com/sports/m-wpolo/recaps/101511aac.html

For the No. 3 USC women’s volleyball team, the streak hasn’t been snapped — at least not yet.
Overpowering · Senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter, pictured here on Friday against Oregon, finished with a total of 31 kills during the weekend. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
After a sweep of Oregon State on Saturday and a four-set win over No. 16 Oregon on Friday, the Women of Troy (15-3, 10-1) are riding a 10-game winning streak — the first time since 2003 when they won 10 consecutive conference matches.
USC is off to its best start in Pac-12 play since that 2003 season, a year in which it finished with a perfect 18-0 mark in conference play en route to an NCAA championship.
On Saturday against Oregon State (11-9, 3-7), USC held the Beavers to a .042 hitting percentage in a 25-12, 25-14, 25-15 sweep.
USC coach Mick Haley was able to play 14 different players in the win.
Among those players who saw extended time on the court was sophomore middle blocker Alexis Olgard, who is still trying to fully recover from offseason knee surgery and a case of mononucleosis.
“We’re trying to get [Olgard’s] intensity up,” Haley said. “She needs to get her legs back and in the middle before she really gets into it. The more we get her better, the better she will be going forward.”
Freshman outside hitter Emily Young registered five kills and two blocks, and freshman setter Hayley Crone notched 10 assists.
Sophomore outside hitter Kirby Burnham had eight kills and sophomore outside hitter Sara Shaw tied for a match-high with nine.
“We played very well as a team against Oregon State with everyone making a nice contribution,” Haley said. “I like the freshmen we put in there. [Freshman middle blocker] Hannah Schraer has been playing great. [Freshman setter/opposite] Emily Young has played well on the right side and allows us to have her come in and spell [junior outside hitter] Katie Fuller and [sophomore outside hitter] Kirby Burnham.”
On Friday, No. 16 Oregon (12-5, 5-4) challenged USC, taking the Women of Troy to four sets before falling 25-15, 25-27, 25-23, 25-21.
“We were glad to have the win, especially since I didn’t think we played exceptionally well,” Haley said. “UCLA had trouble with them also, so we have to feel pretty good about getting the win.”
Leading the charge was senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter, who had a match-high 22 kills and a season-high 14 digs.
“Jupiter seemed focused all night and she looked like she was in the zone the whole time,” Haley said. “It was fun for me to watch her and she has been doing a lot to elevate her game.”
Jupiter leads the Pac-12 in points per game with 5.23 and also sits at the top of the Pac-12 rankings with 17 service aces, as no other player has more than 11.
Oregon sophomore middle blocker Ariana William led the Ducks with 15 kills and five blocks.
Along with Williams, junior outside hitter Katherine Fischer had 10 kills with 20 digs and junior outside hitter Alaina Bergsma notched double digits in kills and digs, with 11 of each.
The Ducks’ pushing the match to four sets marked just the second time an opponent has not been swept during the Women of Troy’s ongoing 10-game win streak.
Senior middle blocker Lauren Williams notched 10 kills and five blocks, and junior outside hitter Katie Fuller added 11 kills, 10 digs and three blocks.
Senior setter Kendall Bateman had 49 assists on the day, along with a season-high three kills.
Sophomore libero Natalie Hagglund registered 25 digs, moving her to second place in the category among Pac-12 players.
“Hagglund has raised her level, as other teams aren’t serving to her, she can focus on her defense,” Haley said. “She’s been all over the place doing different things on defense and showing some great progress.”
The Women of Troy face Utah and Colorado at the Galen Center next Friday and Saturday.
Both matches are scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.

One of the moments from last Thursday’s showdown between USC and California — one which will only continue to reinforce outdated notions — remains a fourth-down play in the opening minutes.
Facing a fourth-and-goal from its eight-yard line on its first drive of the game, USC lined up in a rather unusual formation and quickly snapped the ball to senior tight end Rhett Ellison, who was lined up to the left of the offensive line.
But Ellison fumbled the ball and Cal recovered. The game was still knotted up at zero. The Trojans’ momentum was essentially gone. The reset button was pressed.
“That’s no fun,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said when asked why he chose not to kick a more conventional 25-yard field goal. “We’re on ESPN; we’ve got to do something.”
Though the comments made in jest were attempted to elicit a few laughs, they’ve come to assume a larger significance: Kiffin and USC are not just bold, they’re brash.
The chant “Big Balls Pete” was recited so often throughout the last decade that the expectation is that Kiffin, as well, wears the same pants as his predecessor.
But they’re different.
On Thursday, nothing about USC, fourth-and-goal play aside, was particularly unconventional. USC ran the ball 37 times; it passed the ball 35 times. It kicked extra points, too. Perhaps, most importantly, it didn’t turn it over — Cal did on five different occasions.
Nobody will admit it, but Kiffin and company have to love playing Cal. It would seem so anyway.
The Golden Bears haven’t beaten USC since 2003 — a triple overtime victory over the Trojans in Berkeley — when Aaron Rodgers was under center. It’s been a while — eight years in fact. Junior quarterback Matt Barkley was in the seventh grade. Kiffin was the Trojans’ wide receivers coach.
Jeff Tedford, who took over as Cal’s coach in 2002, has beaten USC just once.
During the last four games, USC has won by a combined margin of 125-29. In fact, only once during that span has Cal posted double-digit point totals — 14 in last season’s loss.
In turn, USC did everything it needed to do against Cal. It didn’t lose. It played it safe. It protected the ball and it watched the Golden Bears seemingly self-destruct.
It didn’t need to call pass plays on third-and-18. It didn’t need specialized two-point conversion attempts, either.
All it had to do was watch quarterback Zach Maynard try to beat them and he couldn’t. He completed just 58 percent of his passes without a touchdown. He threw three interceptions. He fumbled on his team’s first offensive series.
It was a performance for Cal that mirrored that of Kevin Riley a year ago when the then-senior quarterback completed less than 50 percent of his passes in addition to two interceptions.
“Mistakes, turnovers, you can’t beat a good football team like USC when you turn the ball over five times,” Tedford said. “We just need to find a way to put it all together.”
The secret to beating Cal — although it’s not much of a secret these days — certainly appears to be letting Cal self-destruct. Cal commits turnovers. It commits penalties. It somehow manages to give a game away.
USC emerged victorious by a three-touchdown margin, though you wouldn’t have noticed.
Most fans, most media types, mostly everyone, wanted style points. They wanted USC to not only limit an opponent to less than 10 points — the first time since November 2009 — but put on a record-setting offensive display akin to its Oct. 1 performance against Arizona.
During the weekend, No. 1 LSU won 38-7, No. 2 Alabama won 52-7, No. 3 Oklahoma won 47-17 and No. 4 Wisconsin won 59-7.
But the Trojans aren’t a top-five team. They have flaws. The depth of talent isn’t there.
None of that, however, warrants an obituary.
USC is 5-1.
It hasn’t played the top teams on its schedule in Oregon or Stanford, sure, but a winning percentage of .800 and a tie for first place in the Pac-12 South isn’t necessarily something to shrug off, either, especially at the midway point of the season.
With limitations, the Trojans aren’t going to beat any team by 50 points, but 10 wins this season is certainly attainable by playing it safe.
The Trojans didn’t turn it over Thursday. Cal did and did often. Being conservative, offensively anyway, isn’t flashy. It isn’t going to wow most voters — USC is still three spots out of the Associated Press top-25 poll.
But if USC is still scouring for a recipe for success in the hopes of besting last season’s win total, this should work out just fine.

It’s time too kick the crap out of the drunks. After all that has happened and Notre Dame’s involvement in it. GENTLEMAN YOU KNOW WHAT HAS TO BE DONE.
The Cal game, for SC,was the opposite of the ASU game.  Barkley and team had better be prepped for a hard fought game in South Bend or they’ll habe another loss like the ASU loss.  ND is favored by 8,5, and you know Brian Kelly will have his team charged up to play hard &fast all game.
This game is Barkley’s momentto shine as a top notch QB, whichi he hasn’t done in the away games this season.
The entire team MUST step it up in order to beat ND.
Fight on brothers & sisters.
Beat the Irish…. Big time.  Embarrass Kelly and the ND season on national TV.  They are focused on doing the same and Paul Dee would love it….. Dont give anyone reason to disparage the SC players and program.

Though USC managed to score 30 points at California, the scoreboard didn’t quite indicate the offensive struggles throughout much of the night.
Just off · Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods finished with a season-low five receptions and 36 yards against the Golden Bears. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Junior quarterback Matt Barkley finished 19-of-35 for 195 passing yards and two touchdowns, but in the second half, he was just 6-of-13 for 55 passing yards. Not particularly impressive statistics number-wise, but with zero turnovers and a win, the signal caller was pleased with the end result on a night where the defense stepped up.
“[The defense] came away with a bunch of turnovers,” Barkley said. “We struggled on offense, but we protected the ball and they didn’t. I think that was what ultimately helped us go out on top.”
Barkley’s top target, sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, was held in check for much of the game, too. Woods finished with five receptions for 36 yards after averaging 11 receptions and 149 yards in his first five contests.
“I don’t think [Cal] did anything different,” Barkley said. “They were crowding a bit to [Woods’] side a lot — they had a young freshman corner so they didn’t want to put him on an island — with a safety over the top, but we’ve seen that before.”
Though Cal’s secondary was able to contain Woods, four other USC receivers notched two or more receptions and eight different players caught passes (aside from Woods).
—
Freshman George Farmer made his long-awaited USC debut halfway through the season — not as a wide receiver but as a running back. As a five-star recruit coming out of Serra High, many expected Farmer to start opposite sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods. That spot, however, has been filled by freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee.
Heading into the Cal game, USC coach Lane Kiffin had not explicitly stated whether Farmer would burn his redshirt and play. Farmer made his debut early in the contest on the Trojans’ second play from scrimmage in the first quarter.  Despite a four-yard loss on the pitch play, he made the most of his opportunities throughout the game, including a 14-yard reception that nearly turned into a touchdown.
“I was a little nervous, but I came out here and did what I had to do,” Farmer said. “I had a couple plays and I was feeling good — I had fun.”
—
The list of injuries for the Trojans keeps growing. Redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris and freshman linebacker Lamar Dawson were ruled out of Thursday’s contest against California.
After the game, USC lost two more key players on defense because of injury: Sophomore safety Demetrius Wright suffered a lower leg contusion and was on crutches after the game and freshman cornerback Anthony Brown broke his left ankle early in the second quarter.
On offense, the Trojans lost Lee, who sprained his acromioclavicular joint in his right shoulder after a touchdown catch, and senior running back Marc Tyler, who dislocated his left shoulder.
“I don’t know a whole lot about those injuries,” Kiffin said. “That’s why I was proud of our second half. We were getting banged up and I just wanted that clock to run out at the end of the fourth quarter.”
—
With Tyler possibly out of the lineup for for a few weeks, junior running back Curtis McNeal could see the bulk of the carries.
McNeal had 17 carries for 86 yards and one touchdown and was the Trojans’ most efficient back Thursday.
Despite not receiving consistent playing time in USC’s first five games, McNeal had averaged almost 8.5 yards per carry coming into the contest.
Kiffin noted McNeal could thrust himself into a starting role soon with his solid play.
“He’s playing really well, but Curtis has to stay healthy, too,” Kiffin said. “Curtis has been banged up, too. He’s been in and out of practices for two weeks [dealing with injuries].”
 
Quick Hits
– USC’s victory extends its win streak over Cal to eight games. The last time the Golden Bears defeated the Trojans was in 2003.

For a split second, California quarterback Zach Maynard almost made it close.
Taking it away · Freshman linebacker Dion Bailey (above) celebrated the first of two interceptions against California. The Trojans forced five turnovers and held the Golden Bears to under 10 points — the first time they had held a team to single-digits since November 2009. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
With the Golden Bears trailing USC 20-0 late in the second quarter, Maynard completed three straight passes, moving the ball down to the USC 10-yard line. On the next play, however, the junior signal caller’s pass was intercepted by freshman linebacker Dion Bailey, preserving the Trojans’ near three-touchdown lead heading into halftime.
“We had to come out and show everybody we’re not as bad a defense as everybody says we are,” Bailey said.
The Trojans’ defense forced five turnovers at California (3-3, 0-3), edging the host Golden Bears 30-9 in front of a crowd of 44,043 at AT&T Park in San Francisco. Before Thursday night’s contest, USC (5-1, 3-1) had forced just four turnovers in five games.
“If I was going to pick a way to win a game, I would rather win it this way because it instills confidence in our defense,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said.
The defense had appeared out of sync in recent weeks.
In the Trojans’ last two games, they allowed a combined 84 points. Against Cal, they surrendered just 329 total yards and one touchdown for a season-low nine points. It marked the first time since Nov. 28, 2009 — a 28-7  win over UCLA — that the Trojans held a team to less than 10 points in a game.
Though the Golden Bears’ oft-heralded receiving duo of Keenan Allen and Marvin Jones combined for 19 receptions for 249 yards, but bother were unable to haul in a touchdown pass.
“They’re a heck of a team coming in and we were nervous about their two receivers,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “But we did a good job. If you turn the ball over that much, it’s really hard to win games.”
Cal did make a late third-quarter run similar to other second-half defensive struggles for USC against Arizona State and Arizona, where the Trojans were outscored in the final two quarters. Opening the third quarter with a 23-yard field goal from freshman kicker Andre Heidari, which ballooned its lead to 23 points, USC watched Cal respond with a field goal of its own followed by a three-yard touchdown run from Maynard.
Heidari connected on all three field attempts from 39 yards, 29 yards and 23 yards.
Despite cutting the Trojans’ lead to just two possessions, Maynard would watch Bailey intercept another pass midway through the fourth quarter. The turnover would set up a two-yard touchdown run from junior tailback Curtis McNeal that put the game largely out of reach.
“He’s playing really well,” Kiffin said of McNeal, who led the team in rushing on the night with 86 yards on 17 carries.
Collectively, however, USC’s offense looked much less potent than it did Oct. 1 at home against Arizona. Barkley, who broke the school single-game record for passing yards with 468 against the Wildcats, threw for just 195 yards Thursday and was not picked off.
“I played all right,” Barkley said of his performance. “Not good enough to win big games, but always something to improve upon.”
The junior signal caller — though throwing two touchdown passes — completed just 54 percent of his passes, his lowest completion percentage of any game of the season thus far.
“Just the little things were off,” he said. “I either put too much air under it or not enough.”
The Trojans, even while jumping out to an early lead, finished with just 313 yards of total offense and were outgained by Cal, which finished with 329 yards of total offense.
Yet, it was the third fewest yards the defense has given up this season — it gave up 302 against Minnesota and 319 against Utah.
“We’re not happy with how the game went, but we’re 5-1, so you have to remember that too,” Kiffin said.
The Trojans, who travel to South Bend, Ind., this weekend to face Notre Dame, winner of four straight since opening the season 0-2, remain content — at least somewhat — with five wins halfway through the season.
“It’s huge,” Barkley said. “You kind of feel bad because of our performance today, but when you look at the scores, you’ll see we won by three scores, the defense played awesome and that we are 5-1.”
Coupled with Arizona State’s 41-27 loss at Oregon on Saturday night, the Trojans, at 3-1 in conference play, are tied for first in the Pac-12 South with the Sun Devils.

Why remake a 1984 classic nominated for two Academy Awards? To illustrate just how much the teenage generation has changed in 27 years.
Dynamic duo · Protagonists Willard (Miles Teller, pictured left) and Ren (Kenny Wormald, pictured right) stir up Beaumont and attempt to revitalize the city’s taboo outlets of rock ‘n’ roll and dancing. - Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures
Built on the advertising scheme “This is our time,” Footloose, which hit theaters Friday, trades eight-tracks for iPods, rock anthems for hip-hop and ’80s vintage for modern garb. Despite, some upgrades and omissions, much of the original plot remains the same.
Ren MacCormack (Kenny Wormald), the protagonist of the film, moves in with relatives of Beaumont, Ga., after the death of his mother. Well-traveled, Ren finds it difficult to adjust to the stifling climate of the small town where, because of the deaths of five teenagers in a car crash while driving home from a party, dancing and playing loud music are against the law. Determined to make the most of his senior year, Ren makes friends with native Beaumontians while challenging the stringent laws stifling the town’s youth.
Director Craig Brewer isn’t out to rewrite the classic film; he keeps much of the original plot intact. In fact, much of the character’s dialogue remains the same. Fans of the 1984 version will recognize lines like “That’s a nice tie. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise,” and “I think you’ve been kissed a lot.”
Individual motivations and flaws are the same, although the actors bring some of their own color and depth to their characters. Wormald’s Ren is more motivated than Kevin Bacon’s and though he doesn’t surpass Bacon in the gymnastic dance scene, he shows audiences he is a close second. Actress Andie MacDowell, despite the fact that she has less screen time than Dianne Wiest, manages to convey a sassier, 21st-century preacher’s wife while still maintaining the original character’s values.
Much of Footloose’s music remains true to the original soundtrack. Brewer uses familiar shots during Willard’s famous learning-to-dance montage and remixes “Let’s Hear it For the Boy” over Miles Teller’s hilarious faux-choreography. Themes of “Holding out for a Hero” play over some of the more emotionally driven scenes and, of course, “Footloose” opens and closes the film.
Despite keeping much of the original script, the new Footloose makes some minor changes that affect the tone of the movie.
Unlike the first Footloose, the latest version censors less graphic violence. The infamous car crash that sets the plot of the film in motion is the first sequence shown in the film, and although there is no gore, the scene is emotionally affecting. Yet Brewer, in a sense, trades one car scene for another. Ariel, the rebellious daughter of Reverend Shaw Moore, no longer straddles two cars and laughs at an approaching tractor trailer on her quest for liberation. Instead, she leans dramatically out of the window of her thrill-seeking boyfriend’s racecar and waves a black-and-white checkered flag as the car enters the winning circle. Fans of the original might also be saddened to realize the standoff between Chuck and Ren no longer involves tractor-trailers. Now, the characters race school buses, a plot device left unexplained, and leaving audiences confused.
Like the absent car scene, certain characters are also missing in the new version, namely Ren’s mother. Ren arrives in Beaumont alone (from Boston, not Chicago), and for that reason, is perhaps more vulnerable. Brewer’s Ren helps his mother through the last stages of leukemia and after his mother dies, moves in with his Uncle Wesley, who is generally more likeable in this version of the film. Wesley, played by Ray McKinnon, resembles more of a hip uncle who wouldn’t mind witnessing the progression of Beaumont than the stern relative who treats his nephew like an outsider in the original. Wesley also has great one-liners in the film. “Not everyone has this town on lockdown like I do,” he tells Ren after getting him released from a parking ticket fine.
Willard, Ren’s best friend (Miles Teller), is also considerably funnier in the newer version. He perfects a Southern accent and small town ignorance while still harboring much of the original character’s charm and goofy grins.
“Do I look good,” he asks girlfriend Rusty, played by Ziah Colon.
“Yeah,” she answers. “You look sexier than socks on a rooster.”
A more striking character difference in the new Footloose appears in the character of Ariel, (Julianne Hough). Unlike Lori Singer’s church-girl-who-just-wants-to-dance routine, Hough’s portrayal of Ariel is more promiscuous. She tosses her hips around in tight shorts, takes off her shirt and waves it around like a flag and works her dance partners like stripper poles. Perhaps this is just another way Brewer attempts to modernize Footloose, but it contradicts Ren’s final speech.
“And that is the dancing we’re talking about,” Ren says as he appeals to the Reverend Moore. “Aren’t we told in Psalm 149, ‘Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song. Let them praise His name in the dance?’”
This might have worked in the original when dancing was simply dancing. But in Brewer’s version, the grinding, crumping and rump-shaking prevent the speech from having the same effect.
Not all of Brewer’s changes have negative effects on the film. More realistic fight scenes, wittier dialogue, a more diverse cast and difficult, synchronized choreography make Footloose a fun film. At the very least, if Brewer’s film doesn’t top the classic, it handles changes and targets the contemporary generation very well.
Julianne Hough from “Dancing with the Stars” filled the role of Ariel Moore, the Reverend’s free-spirited, rebellious daughter.  Hough could not compare to Lori Singer as Ariel. Singer made Ariel appear to be dangerously beautiful and lost in her desire to feel free from father’s influence. On the other hand, Hough wasn’t quite as stunning. For instance, the scene when Ariel plays a game of chicken with a train was far more emotional in the original. Singer’s earth shattering scream just before Bacon pushes her out of the way made her seem wild and vulnerable.
The town’s name is  BOMONT in the movie.  NOT BEAUMONT.
[…] Brewer&#39s remake adheres to outdated audio and themes Director Craig Brewer isn&#39t out to rewrite the classic film he keeps much of the authentic plot intact. In reality, significantly of the character&#39s dialogue continues to be the very same.

Ja jang myun, a comfort food that kindles feelings of hunger and pleasure, is as much of a cultural icon in Korea as kimchi.
Called “zha jiang mien” in Chinese and “ja jang myun” in Korean, these “fried sauce noodles” are, in the simplest definition, a bowl of cooked noodles doused in a dark, chunky sauce that has been stir-fried with meat. Though the dish is native to China, zha jiang mien has been most enthusiastically embraced by Koreans since it was introduced to them by Shandong immigrants about 100 years ago.
Even just 20 years ago, it was a dish saved for special occasions like birthdays, festivities and weddings, the way an American family might celebrate a graduation at a nice steakhouse.
Influential noodles · The Chinese dish zha jiang mian was the precursor to the Korean dish ja jang myun. Both dishes are available in numerous eateries in Los Angeles, including Mandarin House and Malan Noodle. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
But as Korea’s economy boomed, ja jang myun shifted from a special treat to fast food. The red neon signs of ja jang myun houses now light up the streets of Korea in greater numbers than the yellow arches of McDonald’s.
In Korea, ja jang myun can be ordered over the phone and received piping hot within half an hour in real bowls and chopsticks. Instead of dining at an elegant table at a posh Korean-Chinese restaurant, ja jang myun is now a cheap, convenient, casual meal often wolfed down in front of the TV, with the bowl and cutlery left outside for the delivery guy to take back to someone who will wash and reuse them at the eatery. So commercialized is this dish that it even comes in an instant ramen packet.
Once a foreign dish, Korean ja jang myun now even influences the taste of Korea’s Asian neighbors. Many internationally popular Korean dramas prominently feature characters eating this Koreanized dish, creating a worldwide lust for the inky, messy and aesthetically unattractive dish.
There are more Korean-Chinese restaurants serving ja jang myun in Koreatown than there are Chinese restaurants that sell the original version in all of Los Angeles. Every Korean-Chinese restaurant will have ja jang myun on the menu, and most patrons won’t leave without ordering at least a bowl of it.
Mandarin House on Eighth Street, The Dragon on Vermont Avenue, Shin Peking and Young King on Olympic Boulevard are all well-known choices for authentic ja jang myun.
You’ll smell it as it’s being carried to your table — it’s pungent and bold, yet sweetly so, kind of like the intense sweet-savory aroma of bacon and pancakes drizzled with maple syrup. Sink your chopsticks in, toss the noodles well and slurp up a good twirl of sauce-coated strands, and you’ll be infatuated with the caramelized, inky intensity of the contrasting flavors.
The only similarity Chinese and the Korean “fried sauce noodles” share is the dark fried sauce served over noodles.
Korean ja jang myun is tarry with elaborate additions included by early Chinese restaurants to appeal to the Korean taste. Instead of the salty, brown yellow bean sauce used in Chinese zha jiang mien, the Korean adaption is imbued with the darker, sweeter chunjang (a pitch-black paste made from roasted soybeans), and thickened with cornstarch.
Diced pork or seafood provide the dish’s protein, and vegetables like onions, zucchini, potato and carrots are also included. Pickled radish and raw onion with chunjang for dipping are essential side dishes to cleanse the palate. The result is a richer, blacker, sweeter version of the Chinese zha jiang mian.
The Chinese version is simple and basic: ground pork, a bean paste, perhaps a sprinkle of chopped scallions and raw cucumber strips.
Beijing zha jiang mian uses salty, fermented sauce made from yellow beans, while most other Chinese regions, including Taiwan, use sweeter sauces also made from fermented yellow beans but sweetened and thickened with sugar and starch. Sichuan zha jiang mien will adopt its trademark spicy touch, either from a spicy yellow bean sauce or hot chili oil.
It’s a plain dish cooked in a home kitchen, not ordered out and not delivered. That makes the original version — the Chinese zha jiang mian — harder to find.
Malan Noodle, a tiny Chinese restaurant stuck in a strip mall in Hacienda Heights, has one of the best zha jiang mian dishes in Los Angeles. You can choose the width — thin or thick — and shape — round, flat or triangle — of your noodles, and they will be made fresh to order.
You only need a long, slippery inhale of the chewy strands to realize the star of this dish is its noodles. The delicate sauce is merely a chunky, gingery sidekick to loosen up the carbs.
101 Noodle Express in Alhambra is another fine option for Shandong-style zha jiang mian. Order it with hand-pulled noodles, which come thick and flat like fettuccine. The brawny medley of ground pork, tofu cubes and pickles weighs down the noodles, soaking them with tart and savory juices.
Nothing about “fried sauce noodles” is elegant or aesthetically pleasing. The dish looks like noodles with a charcoal-colored sludge plopped on top. But the taste is complex, taking on a different dimension of flavor as culture and history interact.

Last Saturday night at the Hollywood Palladium marked the lively musical extravaganza that is Dropkick Murphys. Formed in Boston, the Irish punk-folk band has become a cultural icon for the city. After releasing six albums since 1998, the rock band is touring in promotion of its seventh studio effort, Going Out In Style.
A motley audience of various ages crowded to get into the venue. College-aged and middle-aged groups populated the pit before the show, steadily increasing in number during openers The Insurgence and Swingin’ Udders.
The show kicked off on an artistic note: pitch black with a beautiful female voice sharing an Irish folk tune.
The chillingly soft vocals were brought to an abrupt end when Dropkick ran onto the stage. Bright lights, heavy guitars and shouting voices invigorated the roaring crowd, which had just erupted into a raging mosh pit.
People were forced to seek solace in the back of the venue to avoid being tossed from side to side as blistering Irish rock deafened their ears. The chaos escalated even further when after the first act with Seattle’s The Insurgence, droplets of blood splattered across the floor.
Blood, sweat and kilts.
The band rattled and rolled through its catalogue of hits, including songs such as “Going Out In Style,” “Johnny, I Hardly Knew Ya” and “Black Velvet Band,” while at least 10, maybe more, men in kilts danced the night away in support of their Irish heritage.
Many L.A.-ridden Bostonians flocked to the show emblazoned with East Coast paraphernalia. But locals and fans of the folk-punk stylings of the Murphys were representative of the band’s heavy West Coast following, serving as a testament to one of the widest and most dedicated fan bases in its niche market.
The energy packed into the venue was enlivened by the universal love of punk rock and the crowd’s diversity. The show was quite a unique experience as a vast variety of age groups came together for this punk-folk extravaganza — a concert one would assume to be reserved for twenty-somethings.
Dropkick Murphys were keen on the diversity in the crowd and projected their attention toward the various groups. They played new tunes for new fans, an acoustic set for those who perhaps wanted the volume turned down a decibel or five and the oldie-but-goodie hits for the die-hards. The musicians were evidently adept at encouraging the crowd by directing their content toward the specific audience and feeding off the crowd’s energy.
Though somewhat expected, the crux of the show came when the Dropkicks seamlessly transitioned into the band’s most commercial gem, “Shipping Up To Boston,” featured in the Academy Award winning film The Departed. The entire space bounced and chanted in unison to the booming bass and catchy lyrics, causing the mosh pit to return full force.
After “Boston,” the band continued the show with a cover of AC/DC’s “TNT.” The crowd exploded upon hearing the first few famous chords. Water bottles, flying through the air, soaked the crowd and flying shoes whizzed by people’s heads. Dropkick Murphys, evidently, are one to attract a projectile crowd.
After a long applause for the finale, concert goers revived the famous Dropkick chant. The band revisited the stage to close out the set with two numbers that invited all the women in the audience to join the band in singing a vivacious rendition of “Kiss Me, I’m Shitfaced.”
After the girls had their moment to shine, the guys in the audience rushed the stage and turned the performance area into a classically drunken Dropkick family throwdown. Strangers sang and danced together, demonstrating the unifying good-cheer evident in the Dropkick Murphys subculture.
The energy was there Saturday night, and the music was spot-on. Dropkick Murphys prove that, after these 13 years, they still have it. Somehow, this band has discovered how to revive an aging catalog in a fresh, intense musical experience that is “wicked awesome!”
Great article – it really captures the DKM spirit. They didn’t play “Johnny” on Saturday, though…

Some companies have begun to reward employees for the unthinkable: failure.
Could this approach be beneficial in academics? Giving credit for failure in certain situations is worth trying in business, but it does not lead to positive outcomes in other fields — specifically academics.
In college education, the penalty for making mistakes is very severe. Grades, GPAs and order of merit are viewed as critical to our future, but the need to give grades means little to no tolerance for mistakes.
At USC, the freedom to make mistakes is limited by the need for high grades. In most classes, students do not get opportunities to correct or re-submit papers.
Moreover, the “extra credit” policy, a controversial approach, allows students to make mistakes, as long as they understand they will need to do the extra work to demonstrate they are achieving desired learning outcomes.
But some would argue such a policy might encourage laziness and careless work, and extra credit means those bright and hard-working students no longer have the opportunity to stand out. This is not quite the case in the business world.
The Wall Street Journal reports a growing number of companies are giving employees rewards for making mistakes and taking edgy risks, a bold move long overdue.
Clearly, however, goals in education are different from the ones in business, and what might work well in an advertising agency does not make much sense at USC.
Choosing to reward failure or risk at school does not mean policy should be adjusted to reward sloppy, careless work reflective of indifference, lack of preparation or inability to handle the demanding work of getting a solid education.
As students, we are always being reminded we will soon enter the working world.
It is incongruent to be punished for taking risks in education, only to be rewarded for them in our future careers.
The WSJ reported an example of risk reward from Grey, an advertising agency. Tor Myhren, the head of Grey’s New York office was worried fast growth was not matched by a consistent source of creative ideas.
His response was to hand out “heroic failure” rewards — standardized trophies for people who take the best risks.
“Failure, and how companies deal with failure, is a very big part of innovation,” Judy Estrin, founder of seven high-tech companies and author of a book on innovation, told the WSJ.
In the business world, making mistakes because of a lack of hard work or laziness is bad; hiding mistakes is even worse.
If employees try something that was worth trying and fail,  however, and learn from their failures, then making mistakes is a good thing.
Employees become more motivated to work, which lowers the turnover rate and improves the integrity of the company in the long run.
Grey’s “heroic failure” rewards exemplify this idea and merit scholarly research and experimentation.
In education, however, taking risks could lead to worse results and could ruin one’s GPA.
In the current job environment, employees often feel afraid to fail.
Students feel the same way in their educational pursuits.
We should be wary in rewarding failure and should take a definitive stance on how we want to incentivize risk.

Last week Gov. Jerry Brown signed the second half of the California Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act into law, which will allow undocumented college students to apply for financial aid at state universities.
The act, first introduced in 2001, has two parts: AB130 and AB131.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
AB130 was signed into law in July and allows undocumented students to apply for private financial aid.
AB130, the second half signed into law last week, allows undocumented students who meet certain requirements, such as graduating from a California high school, to apply for state scholarships and financial aid. They will qualify for this aid only after all legal residents have been given the opportunity to apply.
Both aspects of the law mark a progressive and positive step for California’s educational system. Undocumented students are entitled to the same basic rights. AB130 ensures undocumented students will earn their way into college just like documented students.
Michael Varela, lead organizer of the Improving Dreams Equality Access and Success movement at USC, a support organization for undocumented students, agrees with Brown’s decision.
“For universities like USC where we have such a prodigious and constantly growing endowment, the implementation of the DREAM Act will not have any detrimental effects for any student,” Varela said in an email. “These universities may become the best option for undocumented students in their pursuit for a greater future and will probably stand out as ‘factories’ pumping out exceptional leaders in various academic fields who just so happen to be undocumented.”
The United States is a nation of immigrants built upon the ethos of the American dream: Opportunity and equal access, liberty and equality. Why, then, have the terms “undocumented” and “illegal immigrant” become synonyms for a person undeserving of the pursuit of the American dream?
For undocumented students at USC, the passage of California’s DREAM Act is a symbolic milestone in an ongoing fight for equality.
And for all the rest, there is really no harm done. The students who will benefit from the act are already in the United States and have been their entire lives. We all stand to benefit from supporting their education.
Illegal immigration has long been a hot-button issue in the United States. It is a difficult, emotive topic that has returned to center stage with the ongoing debates regarding immigrants and education in states from Alabama to California.
Education has always been a historic battleground for social justice issues. And now, the shift from a federal act to one enforced at a localized level makes it even more critical that students be educated about the Golden State’s version of the federal act of the same name.
Whether you support the DREAM Act or not, it’s key to realize this is an education issue that cannot only make or break individual lives, but the state’s future. It’s time to separate subjective bias from fact and learn about what the act actually means for all Californians.
Cal Grants are the most common route to paying for a college education in California for students who could not otherwise afford it. If students meet GPA and income requirements, they receive money from the state to pay for costs such as tuition, room and board, books or supplies. With these requirements, the state provides scholarships to those who have worked for it. The common argument that the DREAM Act is simply another government handout to an undeserving group is invalidated by these stringent provisions.
Cal Grants are the largest source of California state aid and one of the sources of greatest misunderstanding in the debate about immigrants and education. For some, it seems unfair that public money might go to individuals who aren’t legally supposed to live in the state.
The California Department of Finance, however, estimates the cost for about 2,500 students who will qualify for Cal Grants as a result of the DREAM Act — $14.5 million — only makes up 1 percent of the annual $1.4 billion Cal Grant budget. It is a minimal cost for such a monumental step for California.

Californians suffer under some of the most oppressive taxation in the United States. Higher Education is the one service that the state sells. We need to maximize the revenue for the one product we sell.
Giving away limited numbers of tax dollars to selected students is not equality. Merit scholarships are not equal. Athletic scholarships are not equal. The only true way to achieve equality is to give every student the exact same amount of tax dollars – $0.00. Our state needs to start charging the true amount to EVERY student and stop giving away education at a discount. If education is worth what you pay for; we should not be shy in asking people to pay more now in order to receive huge returns later.
Every school has an alumni association – these are not tax payer dollars. Private groups fund selected students – these are not tax payer dollars. Students private groups fund is none of the public’s business. When taxes go to student “A” over student “B” I have a  problem.
The cost of AB 131 is more like $38 Million when you add in EOPS, fee (tuition )waivers, Transfer and Institutional Grants, for the first year alone.  Also, the best and the brightest is doubtful when:  Community Colleges do not require a minimum GPA (EOPS and waivers), when most State financial aid only requires a GPA of 2.0 to 2.6. that’s a C or C+ to old time scholastics.
This, along with the increased recruitment of out-of-state and Foreign Nationals who can afford the nearly double in-state tuition rate, will “price out” and “place out” Legal California Residents and Legal Immigrant Students who have seen their tuition dramatically increase, lotteries for placement, and are not eligible or have seen their financial aid reduced.  AB 131 is Economic Discrimination with several lawsuits waiting in the wings.
I think the Dream Act is a wonderful thing. It is certainly a beacon of hope amidst awful laws like the ones passed in Arizona and Alabama. The folks at Bashyam Spiro (http://www.bashyamspiro.com) wrote a great post about the injustice of a recent AZ immigration law which sums up how I feel about those pretty nicely.
American or not, I think access to education is something everyone should be able to enjoy. It makes our country a better place!
But what about when that education comes at taxpayers’ expense? Illegal immigrant youths weren’t being denied educational access prior to the passage of this “DREAM Act.” They were eligible to enroll in any of California’s public educational institutions. But apparently, that wasn’t good enough for the advocates of illegal immigration. Nor was in-state (read taxpayer subsidized) tuition good enough. Oh, no. Now, California taxpayers are going to be forced to provide additional subsidies to illegal immigrants — whose eligibility for these subsidies proves that they pay only a modicum of taxes, if any.
greedy twats
So sad that our government’s priority is the children of other nations, when we have so many children of our own to support. When will we learn to take care of our own, those who are legal, and those of our military families?
These ARE the children of THIS nation….don’t get it confused.  Just because they were born in another country and spent a small percentage of their lifetime there, doesn’t make them any less American then you or I.  Most of the students affected have spent an overwhelming large part of their lives in the U.S. and this is all they know, so the only thing that’s truly keeping them from being an American under your standards is a simple piece of paper.
The Dream act is a nightmare, amnesty to provide American business with illegal labor. Read it, at a cost of 6 billion a year we can’t afford it. Nor can we afford amnesty for all families with children 12-18 in school. 
In state tuition is nothing more than paying adults for breaking our laws. At 18 a child brought here illegally has 6 months to return home and come back legally on a student visa or residency (moved to front of line). If they don’t, then they are just as illegal as their parents. Giving them in state tuition is a reward for not going home and coming back legal, they get in state tuition. Those that go home and do things legally have to pay foreign student tuition. 
“The American dream: Opportunity and equal access, liberty and equality” for all [citizens]. Why, then, have the terms “undocumented” and “illegal immigrant” become synonyms for a person undeserving of the pursuit of the American dream?”
No one said they weren’t if they come here legally. If they don’t come legally, they are foreign citizens of another country.  The American dream is difficult if your not an American.
The Dream act is a miracle! It is important to look at an act like this with a very open mind and unbiased attitude. The students themselves can not be punished for the actions of their parents. They may have gotten here illegally but it was not by their own decisions. If you think about it, Cal Grants are offered on a basis of necessity and academic qualifications. These students performed well in high school and have earned their right to financial aid!
The Dream Act is NO miracle. It gives illegal immigrants incentive to come across our borders illegally. It’s a known fact that California is in SERIOUS financial trouble. The last thing we can afford to do is to pay for education for those who dont legally live in our state, but those who don’t legally live in our COUNTRY. I feel for those who are born in poverty stricken countries and are just looking for better lives. But, there is a policy in place to combat that: LEGAL immigration. California should be aiding those who live here legally. We just DO NOT have the finances to give away free education to all.
Please stop equating opposition to taxpayer-funded subsidies for illegal immigrants as “punishment” of the illegal immigrants, OK? Thank you.
WHO IS FIRST–AMERICAN WORKERS OR K STREET LOBBYISTS?
Whoever becomes the President of the United States needs to erect the real border fence. To facilitate the policy described in the 2006 Secure Fence Act, which is a double-layer fence for the two thousand miles, stretching through California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas festooned with razor sharp concertina wire. As an major addition placing a permanent military force on the border, to bond with the U.S. Border Agents; a requirement to assist border sheriffs, who are fighting a never ending battle against drug smugglers and people traffickers. In furtherance, the police need tools for domestic enforcement, so they can be partnered with ICE. “Secure Communities” helps the local police to identify criminal illegal aliens through fingerprints, by forwarding this identification to ICE. The 287 G is another policing program, which offers federal training in apprehending illegal aliens on the highway, such as State Troopers or Highway Patrol, who have the authority to arrest a suspicious driver and hold him for ICE agents.
By far the greatest innovation is the “THE LEGAL WORKFORCE ACT” sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas. Every working American should demand from their Senators and the House Representatives, to vote for this bill. Commonly known as E-Verify (H.R. 2885) it will reduce the chances of millions of illegal migrants or immigrants from being hired. Unless you have a upper management job, everybody is vulnerable from a job loss. If you are lucky to have a job, you can aid the 20 million workers who are seeking employment. Under E-Verify bill business owners are not excused from severe punishment by hiring people of unauthorized status.
Illegal immigration is no longer a minor occurrence, it’s everybody’s problem. This issue is a hundred billion dollar cost every year, extorted from your taxes annually to subsidize foreign nationals who have violated our laws. These are the pregnant women with unborn babies, who navigate past our border fence, or use the airways to enter illegally.  While Americans are paying for other countries downtrodden, we cannot resuscitate our eroding infrastructure, our children’s crowded schools, underfunded hospitals and overpopulated prisons through the affliction of 20 million or more illegal aliens. The expenditure annually is an estimated $113 Billion dollars a year, as according to statistics from The hermitage Foundation.  
E-Verify is a progressive computer program and is being continuously upgraded with more innovations to detect forged ID. In conjunction with form I-9 is progression will soon be a 100 percent successful in verifying who’s eligible for a job. One new piece of software soon to be fully organized is state access to Drivers License records. Mississippi was the first state to offer there Dept of Motor vehicle services.
ILLEGAL—IMMIGRATION—MUST—BE—MADE—A—FELONY.
NumbersUSA, the pro sovereignty, limited immigration group has aided a host of a dozen county sheriffs this week in Washington to make their pleas to Congress and ICE, in favor of all sheriffs to get more federal support in battling illegal immigration in their counties. Local and border Sheriffs are telling their stories of being over-run with trans-national drug trafficking, smuggling operations, Mexican cartels and other immigration-related crime were gripping — and also enraging that our own federal government who are so concerned about helping illegal aliens, while displaying so little enthusiasm in helping the sheriffs. Pressure your U.S. Representative to act to get a committee and floor vote on the CLEAR Act (H.R. 100). This act provides a lot of assistance to local, county and state law enforcement when they want to drive the illegal alien population out of their jurisdictions. Go to your customized website where you will locate a free fax to send to your U.S. Representative. Most of you will find a free fax that urges co-sponsorship of the bill.
The beauty of the CLEAR Act is that it essentially requires the feds to cooperate whenever community law enforcement brings illegal aliens to their attention. While it wouldn’t stop localities from being sanctuaries or offering other enticements for illegal aliens, it would stop the current Administration’s practice of trying to stop localities from pushing illegal aliens out of their communities and would require the feds to give assistance. I cannot think of any single action that would be a more effective protest against the Obama Administration’s anti-local-enforcement efforts or a more effective single action to help our nation’s besieged sheriffs who have tended to be our best allies among the nation’s law enforcement officials.  If you want to fax, go to NumbersUSA or please call 202-224-3121 and ask for your U.S. Representative’s office to urge action this fall on the CLEAR Act. This is the same Washington switchboard number to insist that your local or federal politician to push a vote on the “THE LEGAL WORKFORCE ACT”. Contact Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH); House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA); House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) ; House Chairman of Ways & Means Committee Dave Camp (R-MI);

When revolutionary filmmaker John Waters strode into Norris Cinema Theatre on Friday night to introduce the screening of his most well-known film, Pink Flamingos, he quickly and determinedly grabbed one of the fliers bearing his image and the words “An Evening with John Waters” in gaudy colors and slipped it into his bag.

The Visions and Voices event Friday night celebrated Waters’ career as well as the release of a new book of interviews, edited by USC School of Cinematic Arts professor James Egan.
“I let him do it,” Waters said, pointing at Egan across a conference table. “It’s really his book. I don’t like reading my own interviews. It’s like looking at your own director’s commentaries, and the only person who does that is Barbara Streisand.”
A big fan of the University Press of Mississippi series of filmmaker interview books — other interviews include acclaimed figures such as Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick — Waters said he was thrilled to be asked to have a book.
Though Waters might not revisit his own analyses of his life and work, he does pore over any and all media that concerns him. He collects his reviews and stacks them along with other periodicals along the walls of his Baltimore home.
“I’m an old person — I still read newspapers,” Waters said.
Devouring daily periodicals — including the New York Post, which he lauds for outrageous headlines — has always been part of the filmmaker’s self-education. It’s helped him tap into the pulse of modern culture on his way to confronting the public with the anomalous and the shocking.
“I have little patience for complaints about the press by people in show business. I don’t hate doing it,” Waters said. “It’s an opportunity for me to test jokes. And you can make the best movie of all time but you still have to get people to see it. Press is more effective than ads.”
He said his favorite recent bit of news divulged how a witness to the underwear bomber’s flaming hip region exclaimed, “Dude, your pants are on fire!” His favorite headline of all-time came from an ironic obituary for Ike Turner: “Ike Beats Tina To Death.”
Forty years after the original release of the film, Pink Flamingos continues to have a visceral effect on audiences, as evidenced by groans, cringes and squeals at crucially lurid moments such as castrations, incest scenes and the infamous ending where Divine (perhaps the world’s most famous pop cultural transvestite) eats dog poop.
“I’ve never won an obscenity trial,” Waters said. “I mean it is obscene at 9 a.m. in a courtroom, the jury all strangers; this movie is obscene. Whereas tonight it looks beautiful.
Waters later answered questions from the audience about filmmaking, reality television and his reputation as the “Pope of Trash.”
Waters explained the film, named after the pink flamingos on lawns in his native Baltimore, celebrates those who are honest about their own filth. In the surge following the release of films like the pornographic sensation Deep Throat, Waters had wondered what they could do that wasn’t illegal yet.
“The film was more like political action against the tyranny of good taste,” Waters said.
Waters reported that, although he only saw the last half-hour of the screening, it was the first time he’d seen any part of the film in about 15 years.
“This film is my youth,” Waters said. “If I discover the cure for cancer tomorrow, this film will still be the top thing on my obituary.”
[…] John Waters talks newspapers, show business and Pink Flamingos […]

Five minutes after 7 p.m. The students squirm anxiously in their seats. Some have been waiting an hour. Others longer. Idle chatter rises and falls and everyone’s eyes are trained on the door. Finally, his name is called and he enters the room. Everyone applauds.
Clean-cut, wearing a gray sweater over a white button down shirts, a pair of blue jeans and white low-tops, John Singleton smiled and waved at the audience, professional but laid back. Here for SCA’s Alumni Screening Series and the showing of his most recent film Abduction, he was eager to be back on campus, comfortable in the familiar Norris Theater. He sat in the chair across from interviewer Jack Epps, chair of the SCA Writing Division. The questions began.
Singleton graduated from USC’s School of Cinematic Arts in 1990 as a filmic writing major. During his time at USC, he won several writing awards, drafted several screenplays and spent hours in the Cinema Library watching films and learning how to craft them. He would later go on to direct his film  — Boys N The Hood — just a month after graduating and become the youngest person, at age 24, to be nominated for Best Director.
With perhaps some of the most stellar film credentials SCA can publicize, Singleton’s background is intimidating. Yet here, in a theater crammed with SCA students and their guests, he got personal. He described the audience of his first journey to USC, forcing them to recall their own anxiety about getting into college, into the film school. Only a high school junior, he was stunned by the then-new cinema school and wandered around the building following the first person he saw. That person turned out to be the Dean of Admissions for SCA.
“I thought I was going to piss my pants,” said Singleton, eliciting laughter from the audience.
Singleton described how he built relations with the dean and was admitted to the cinema school after his senior year. Before applying for a major, however, he heard the singular piece of advice that would change how he viewed films.
“If you really want to do this, then learn to write your own movies,” said Singleton, a grin crossing his face as he remembers the guidance he was given. “No one’s going to pass you a script. Also, the cheapest way to make a film is to write it yourself.”
For Singleton, focusing on writing was not a difficult decision. Knowing he wanted to direct, he already viewed films in terms of ideas and had crafted some stories of his own. His application pitch for the film school’s writing program? The story of three friends growing up and surviving the hardships of living in the more dangerous neighborhoods of LA. From Los Angeles himself, Singleton wanted to use his knowledge of the streets to create the accurate, touching film Boys N The Hood that would win him an Oscar nomination.
“I always feel that cinema is a reflection of life,” said Singleton. “We have this medium that’s been around for one hundred years, and it’s just a matter of whether or not what you’re watching is giving you an emotional response.”
After Boys N the Hood, Singleton would go on to craft nine well-known films, five of which he wrote, among them Baby Boy, Poetic Justice, Shaft, and Higher Learning. His latest project, Abduction, staring Taylor Lautner, hit theaters September 23. Yet this particular venture was out of the ordinary for Singleton.
“I did this movie because of my kids,” said Singleton. “They were like ‘You have to write something for us. I mean you make movies that you don’t let us see.’” He made a concerned-parent face and the audience laughed. “There’s so much cursing, you know?”
Though Singleton typically crafts his own stories, the script for Abduction, written by Doug Davidson, made rounds in Hollywood before Singleton decided to sign on. Singleton met with Lautner, by then already casted, who decided that he wanted Singleton to direct the film. He wanted something outside of the teen-girl Twilight series, and he felt Singleton was the perfect director to work with.
“He was great,” said Singleton, smiling mischievously as he relates how much of a relief it was to work with an actor who actually took direction. “I told the kid ‘You’ve got to get kicked around in this movie because that’s what heroes do. You have to do things people don’t expect you to do.’”
Singleton went on to describe how he particularly enjoyed shooting the brutal fight scene Lautner has with his dad. The SCA alum filmed Lautner’s action sequences in a realistic manner, allowing his character to be hurt when he should have been hurt.
“I always try to make it as real as possible,” said Singleton. He settles back into his seat after pantomiming an action sequence. “It’s more disconcerting that way.”
Singleton laughed with his audience, swore and boasted no “holier-than-thou” attitude. He probed the audience for what films they’ve seen, jokingly chides them for good ones they have not, and intimately talks with them about the film industry, its ups and downs, how important it is to stick to your vision. Before leaving, he gave the aspiring filmmakers in the audience a piece of advice.
“You should know how to be your own studio,” said Singleton. He stiffened and as he for the first time as he went into lecture mode. “Know how to write, direct, produce. You should be forming social allies, watching movies, reading material, and supporting each others as artists. It’s really about new blood, not what’s been done before. It’s about thinking new, not about how things used to be.”
Just before the curtain opened, the projector flickered to life, lighting up every eye that followed Singleton as he walked out of the theater.

In the latest development of the Occupy Wall Street protests sweeping the nation, 4,000 protestors in New York City’s Zuccotti Park claimed a small victory when policemen decided to cancel plans to clear-up the park Friday morning.
The cancellation possibly prevented a standoff between policemen and protestors, where 14 people were arrested after the word broke but no major fights or disruptions occurred. Protestors viewed the turn of events as a small victory in their favor, with several hundred marching off toward the financial district following the announcement.
According to New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, the park’s owner, Brookfield Properties, made the decision to cancel cleanup plans. Mayor Bloomberg has taken a stance against the protests, and was quoted by The Guardian as saying, “What they’re trying to do is take away the jobs of people working in the city, take away the tax base that we have. We’re not going to have money to pay our municipal employees or clean out the blocks or anything else.”
The Occupy Wall Street movement was spurred by broad discontent toward government bailouts on behalf of U.S. banks and the huge profits being made on Wall Street, actions which sharply contrasted with the high unemployment and job insecurity affecting the average citizen in America.
Although the protests took root in New York City, the movement has already spread to more than 70 cities across the nation, including an Occupy L.A. movement with protestors and artists camping outside L.A. City Hall.

After months of waiting, Paramore fans will finally have some new music to jam to, with the creation of the Paramore Singles Club.
The Club will allow people to download one of the new songs every few weeks, as long as they join the club on Paramore.net.
At the end of the year, Singles Club members will be sent a limited edition 7-inch box set with four 7-inch records. Only 3,500 of those sets will be offered.
People can choose from four different levels based on what merchandise comes with the purchase. The merchandise options include MP3s, a new Paramore ‘bars’ T-shirt, the box set and Singles Club-only exclusives.
A few songs, such as “Monster” for the Transformers 3 soundtrack, and the acoustic Youtube hit, “In the Mourning,” surfaced at the beginning of the year, but it has been a standstill until now.
For Paramore, it has been a busy year of dealing with the loss of two members, touring and celebrating the 15th anniversary of its label, Fueled By Ramen.
“Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for believing in us,” said the band on its blog.

The set up: Cal, who was playing in the fifth different stadium for the fifth straight game, played host to USC in the annual “Weekender” game at AT&T Park. Coming out of a bye week, the Trojans’ defense hoped to make statement after allowing a school-record 37 first downs to Arizona two weeks before.
The story: Despite being outgained by Cal, USC cruised to a 30-9 victory in an impressive offensive display. Zach Maynard, whose completion percentage is the worst in the conference, struggled to string together consistent series after consistent series. The Bears had several miscues, including botched snaps, interceptions, fumbles, and a fair catch on a punt inside their own 5 yard-line.
The Trojans squandered a field goal opportunity early in the first quarter by faking the kick, but they forced a fumble two possessions later, parlayed it into a field goal for a 3-0 lead, and never looked back. In the second quarter, USC settled in to a groove and scored 17 points of three consecutive possessions to take a 20-0 lead in to the half.
USC opened the second half with a seven-minute drive that milked the clock and added three points to the lead. Cal inched closer with a field goal and a touchdown in the third quarter to cut the lead to 23-9, but Matt Kalil blocked the PAT and Cal lost the mometum it gained. Midway through the fourth, yet another Maynard interception led to a USC touchdown and the final score of the game
Although the defense played well, the USC offense was a bit out of sync. Robert Woods only totaled 5 catcher for 36 yards, and junior quarterback Matt Barkley barely missed him deep a few times.
After the game, Barkley commented on his performance. “Alright,” Barkley said. “Just alright. Not good enough to win big games, but always stuff to improve on.” However, the junior quarterback remained optimistic. “When you play football, you play to win,” Barkley said. “If we’re winning, I’m fine with that.” The offensive captain also acknowledged a need for improvement. “But we just can’t let mistakes happen over and over again against better teams because then that will hurt us. We really have to get it more fine-tuned.”
Turnovers galore: After receiving a heap of criticism during the bye week, USC’s defense showed up and made a definitive statement. The Trojans forced five turnovers, including three interceptions and two fumbles. USC had only forced five turnovers in its previous five games. “It was huge for us as a confidence booster,” linebacker Dion Bailey told reporters after the game. “We had to come out and show everybody that we aren’t as bad a defense as everybody thinks we are. We held them to only nine points. It was huge today. We picked up our offense. Hopefully next week we’re firing on all cylinders and we’ll be dangerous.”
Banged up: Although USC emerged victorious, the win came at a cost. Redshirt senior tailback Marc Tyler dislocated his shoulder and is expected to miss some time. Cornerback Anthony Brown broke his ankle and will require surgery. Finally, freshman standout Marqise Lee sprained his shoulder after falling in to the end zone for a touchdown. Lee, an integral part of the offense, expects to play at Notre Dame.
Up next: USC travels to South Bend for its annual rivalry game with Notre Dame at 5:30 pm (PDT). The Trojans hope to get back on track after Notre Dame snapped an eight game losing streak last year in Los Angeles.
