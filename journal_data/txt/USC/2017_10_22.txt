USC Libraries and public broadcaster KCET have collaborated for the second time to create Lost LA, a TV show about Los Angeles history. The show returned with its second season on Oct. 10 and will run weekly until Nov. 14. 
In January 2011, after KCET parted ways from PBS to become an independent television station, it invited USC Libraries to write content about Los Angeles history for KCET’s shows, using archival materials like photographs, paper documents and maps.
Nathan Masters, USC Libraries’ manager of academic events and programming communications, began writing weekly blog posts for KCET, which featured the visual collections of “LA as Subject.” Eventually, the popularity and amount of views on the website and writings led to the creation of Lost LA, with Masters as its host and producer. 
“There’s so many things to say about [Southern California history],” Masters said. “The city of L.A. grew so fast. In 1900, we were a large town of 100,000 and then in 1930, we were a metropolis of 2 million. We were once a town surrounded by the countryside and all of this open space … and then we had to figure out in 30 years how we would organize our city.” 
Aired in January 2016, the pilot season of three episodes was based on Masters’ blog posts, which primarily focused on the transformation of Southern California’s physical landscape. The season educated viewers on the relationship between the natural environment and the city, the lifestyle of the people living near the Elysian Hills and the topographic comparison of the historic and modern Los Angeles. 
“The history of Southern California is complicated, mysterious and fascinating, and all we need to do to understand that is to drift into the archives that illustrate the history of this region,” said Bill Deverell, Lost LA’s historical advisor. “Various aspects of diversity and demography are a long and old story to our region, so this show reminds us of that historical continuity.”
KCET and USC Libraries took a new approach on how to produce and present the show for Season 2. Rather than creating episodes based on blog posts like the previous season, they instead decided to tell a narrative epic starting from before the Spanish colonization in 1769 to the events happening today, particularly in the San Gabriel Valley. 
“What we want to do with this season is to recenter the telling of L.A. history,” Masters said. “California history is often told at the end of this triumph march westward, from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific. In a way, it makes sense to fold L.A. history into American history because we’re politically a part of the United States.”
However, Masters emphasizes the different cultural and economic ties of the region which he says are largely ignored in popular history.
“Culturally and economically, we’re a part of Latin America and the Pacific Rim too … and those historical ties go back centuries,” Masters said. “We wanted to highlight those this season.”
To present its history, Lost LA utilizes photos that start off as negatives or prints, which eventually get scanned and digitized by the USC Digital Imaging Lab. 
Throughout the series, Lost LA has used a variety of visual materials with photographs, illustrations, paintings and maps from USC Libraries.
These collections contain more than a million photographs of the the physical transformations of Los Angeles, taken for commercial use by private companies, or by newspaper companies within the city. 
In addition to the archives at USC, Lost LA has also used resources from county public libraries, UCLA and the Huntington Library. 
“We want Southern Californians to watch this and and come away with a deeper sense of place,” Masters said. “We want them to understand Los Angeles and the region better and they can do that by having knowledge of our history. We can better understand where we’re headed in the future if we know where we’ve come from.”

The USC Shoah Foundation and USC Institute for Creative Technologies will open the first permanent installation of their interactive Holocaust project on Thursday after over five years of work. 
The installation, New Dimensions in Testimony, features extensive interviews with Holocaust survivors through interactive technology that allows the public to have conversations with the individuals.
The Holocaust survivors were selected from a variety of backgrounds that included a large range in ages, experiences and locations during the war. One of the 15 participants in the project was Eva Schloss, Anne Frank’s stepsister, whose interactive work is currently being displayed in New York at a temporary installation.
The goal of the project was to recreate the intimacy of learning from Holocaust survivors, which the team working on the project attempted to do by allowing the public to ask the interactive displays any question they wished.
“[We wanted] really to preserve as much as possible the experience you can have today talking to a Holocaust survivor in a classroom or a museum,” said David Traum, director for natural language research at the Institute for Creative Technologies. “You hear their testimony [and] ask them questions, getting a sense of immersion, of being in the same environment.”
Responses to the demos were unlike anything that had been expected, said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Shoah Foundation. Many used the opportunity to ask more difficult questions than they would normally ask survivors.
“We didn’t realize how powerful it would be because when you ask a question and the individual answers your specific questions while looking you in the eye, it’s a very engaging experience,” Smith said. “I think people have been more emotionally affected than we realize by what happened. That’s what we were aiming to do, to create that connection, but it’s been at a higher level than we expected.”
The emotional connection is attributed to more than the stories of the survivors.
“A lot of it is the material and definitely the personality of the survivors coming through, but I think this interactive presentation is really an element of that too,” Traum said. “I don’t think we would have the same kind of responses if they were just seeing the videos passively and not asking questions or in the room hearing the questions answered.”
The Shoah Foundation conducted extensive interviews with each Holocaust survivor who participated in the project, asking around 1,500 questions to each of them to cover every topic they expected the public to ask about, Smith said.
Before starting the official interviews  for the installation, the team working on the project had to develop trust with each of the interviewees through a three-month process. They conducted extensive research on the individuals and got to know them and their families.
“By the time we’re interviewing them, we’re not strangers,” Smith said. “We know them very well and by the time we’re finished they’re kind of like intimate friends because we’ve been through a lot together.”
According to Smith, many of the participating Holocaust survivors were surprised about how grueling the process was. Some were familiar with speaking and answering questions at schools, but the process for the installation required more hours of interviewing than they were accustomed to.
“These are tough old people,” Smith said. “They’ve been through the worst human experiences, so they feel like [they] can get through everything, [but] when they’re feeling their age and the lights and the tiredness that goes with answering hundreds of questions, I think they found that a little surprising.”
Family members were invited to attend the final Los Angeles interview to support the participants throughout the process.
During the initial stages of the project, the team overcame several obstacles to make the Holocaust survivors appear realistic.
“The first challenge is to figure out what is it we need to record so that it can carry on a conversation,” Traum said. “You can ask me anything and I have a response for you. It may not be exactly the answer you’re hoping to hear, but there’s a way for me to respond someway even if I say, ‘I don’t want to answer that.’ But, when we record somebody, we’re only going to have the material we recorded and that has to be good for any kind of answer, including something completely different than somebody thought of years before.”
A prototype was created with Pinchus Gutter, a Holocaust survivor who Smith had previously worked with  and knew well. He answered about 200 questions in an interview, which were then analyzed with respect to his answers and the conditions it was done in, Smith said. The prototype was also set up for the public to use so that those working on the project could observe reactions to the interactive and decide what needed to be developed. This produced a few surprising results.
“We hadn’t had to think about how [he responds] if he’s given an opinion or some solace or thanked for his service,” Smith said. “[Gutter’s interactive] would just look at them because that’s not a question.”
Traum said the team had originally hoped to make the Holocaust survivors three-dimensional for a more intimate experience, but did not have the technology to do so. The current installations are displayed two-dimensionally; however, the project was done with considerations for future technology.
“We wanted it to be able to create high-fidelity 3-D holographic type images even if the projectors didn’t exist in 2011 when we started,” Smith said. “We wanted to film in such a way that 10 years from now, 20 years from now, when the projection system exists, we can project it.”

Savory scents filled the air and the sound of rings clinking against bottles reverberated in the distance. Occasionally a burst of laughter would erupt from a corner of McCarthy Quad as dozens of students gathered to enjoy a Taiwanese-style night market on Friday.
Hosted by the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, the night market featured 22 booths with games, prizes, raffles and food from different representative Asian Pacific cultures. The event also highlighted an array of live performances from USC clubs such as Haneulsori’s traditional Korean music, Hawaii Club hula, Japanese drumming ensemble Kazan Taiko and Trojan Bhangra dance. 
“It’s been a pretty longstanding tradition and it’s the biggest event of the year,” said June Moon, an APASA intern and freshman majoring in business administration.
APASA’s night market — which has been held for nearly 10 years — mimicked traditional Taiwanese street fairs which incorporate a variety of food vendors and goods, while also displaying the local urban culture.
With vendors serving boba tea from Twinkle Brown Sugar, desserts from 85C Bakery Cafe, Indian cuisine from Manas, Indonesian food from Simpang Asia and more, attendees had the opportunity to get tastes of different culinary items representative of Asian Pacific culture. Students played traditional games like Bau Cua Ca Cop, a matching game, Gonggi, a catching and throwing pebble game, and Mahjong, Chinese solitaire, for tickets redeemable for themed prizes and food. 
“The Indian fusion dancing and the Hawaiian dancers were things I’ve never seen before, so it was … mesmerizing to watch,” said Brandon Chung, a sophomore majoring in creative writing. “It was a cool experience witnessing the traditions of ethnic groups that you don’t see every day.” 
APASA is an undergraduate student-run organization that aims to foster unity and a community of cultural, social and academic support through educating students on Asian Pacific heritage, history and traditions, according to its website. Additionally, it is the umbrella organization for 23 Asian Pacific American member groups within USC. It also serves as a source of funding and advisement for  its other member organizations. 
“I think that an event like this is necessary in order to foster a sense of greater cultural awareness [around] USC regarding some of the ethnic groups that don’t get as much of a social spotlight, especially because others do,” Chung said. “It gives groups a chance to showcase some of their traditions and cultural activities that they are members of in a way that is most appealing to the casual audience.”
There were also activities that promoted important issues within the Asian Pacific Islander community such as Whitewashed Photo Booth. At the booth, the Asian American Cinema Association brought out cutouts of movie posters where the main characters are of Asian descent but played by white actors and allowed attendees to reclaim the whitewashed movie by taking photos with the cutout where they are the main character. The goal of the event was to not only entertain attendees, but also bring more awareness about social issues, including the lack of Asian Pacific Islander diversity in Hollywood, presented in a fun and engaging way for people of all different backgrounds. 
“We want people to have fun, but the point of APASA and APASA member [organizations] is to introduce all these different cultures and increase visibility for the Asian Pacific American community,” Moon said. “[It’s] just to learn about the rich and diverse culture that the student body represents.”

Music artists are in the business of recreation, so Niall Horan’s new mystique should come as no surprise to devout Directioners. The former boy band member released his solo album, Flicker, last Friday, soothing fans and rebranding his teen heartthrob image. 
Well, he’s done it. Flicker is a soulful acoustic rendition of what seems to be Horan’s intimate journal, with tracks like “Seeing Blind” and “Paper Houses.”
The former One Direction member is no longer confined to the band’s image as he opens up about love, loss and the reality of growing up. His title track, “Flicker,” perfectly captures his sentiments with the lyrics: “When you feel your love’s been taken / When you know there’s something missing / In the dark barely hanging on / When you rest your head upon my chest / I’m afraid what we had is gone.” Horan later professes the flicker of hope that this love gave to him at the beginning of his relationship, setting a thoughtful tone to the bluesy album.
Horan collaborated with several industry talents including Maren Morris, Jamie Scott, Julian Brunetta and Jacquire King. Those featured on Horan’s tracks complement the gruffness of the album without overpowering his vocals.

“Flicker” exceeded expectations, as Horan has strategically rebranded himself to be taken “seriously” by his peers. I say this half-heartedly when comparing him to other artists who’ve rebranded themselves over the years, such as Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry.
While Horan doesn’t have everyone in a complete swoon, the artist has done an exceptional job of converting skeptics. Initially, many thought  Horan  and the former One Direction members were going to be confined to producing tween-pop hits for the remainder of their solo careers. 
However, Flicker is a great example of the former boy band’s ability to push past their critics’ expectations and mature musically. Although Horan did not come out swinging on a wrecking ball, he took the opportunity to demonstrate off his vocal capabilities. He’s real, honest and relatable, and Flicker proves Horan’s worthiness as a solo artist.
In addition to the deluxe album, Apple Music has released a 30-minute short film with the artist about Flicker. “On the Record”  is packed full of anecdotes and personal stories  from Horan. He shares his view on the album, the time it took to perfect it and the artists he collaborated with. The tracks were recorded live in-studio with a full band, which is an adjustment for Horan. He mentions that it took him a while to become comfortable performing live alongside different instruments, but the experience has helped his craft. 
Niall Horan has done his job, sharing a new, more mature side of himself with soothing melodies and heart-wrenching lyrics.

Redshirt freshman wide receiver Tyler Vaughns reflects on his team’s difficult loss to Notre Dame. The Trojans fell to No. 21 in the AP poll after failing to show up in a game with playoff implications. Photo by Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
Within the first two minutes of play, the Trojans’ hopes of defeating rival Notre Dame, reclaiming a spot in the top 10 and vying for a chance to see the playoffs slipped away.
It happened after a perfect three-and-out from the defense, with a near-sack from junior linebacker Cam Smith quieting the crowd. 
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold called the first snap of the game. His eyes were on the defense, swaying and hungry behind the line of scrimmage. They weren’t on the ball, which flew high, hit him in the hands and popped skywards. 
Eyes wide, Darnold scrabbled to retain possession as three defenders descended on him. Out of the dogpile, Notre Dame linebacker Te’von Coney leapt up with the ball in hand, greeted by roars from the Irish crowd. The defense jogged out, heads shaking in disbelief. Three plays later, Notre Dame scored a touchdown off a 26-yard pass and never looked back, handing USC a crushing 49-14 loss.
The team played like this for the rest of the game  — inconsistent, beleaguered and lost. 
“It was embarrassing,” senior captain Chris Hawkins said. “I’m embarrassed.”
If the Trojans knew anything upon entering South Bend, they knew that this game would be a test. The legacy of the rivalry and the cacophony of the sold-out crowd alone could sway any game on any given Saturday. Add in the brutal one-two punch of running back Josh Adams and quarterback Brandon Wimbush, and despite the discrepancy in rankings between No. 11 USC and No. 13 Notre Dame, the Irish didn’t look anything like an underdog.
The game was a test of the grandest proportions. And in a stumbling season full of disappointing outings, the Trojans collapsed.
“We’ve got a sad football team in there right now,” head coach Clay Helton said after the game. “We’ll live and learn from this. Credit [to] Notre Dame. They won the battle in the trenches tonight. I thought they played an excellent game. We helped them by mistakes.”
The first half was, if anything, a well-rounded meltdown. The Trojans coughed up three turnovers for 28 points while the defense struggled to control the gashing rush offense. Even special teams struggled mightily, with sophomore punt returner Jack Jones dropping a punt at the five-yard line and freshman placekicker Chase McGrath missing a 27-yard field goal.
After a shutout half, the score wasn’t all Darnold’s fault. The offensive line crumpled after almost every snap, giving him only a second or two to scan the field before he was forced to desperately scramble away from barrelling tacklers.
But after Darnold fumbled the very first snap of the game, he tossed away yet another interception in the second quarter. The two turnovers put him at 15 on the season, which is more turnovers as an individual than any Pac-12 team has allowed as a whole.
“We don’t try to make excuses. We just try to learn from our mistakes if we make them and try not to make them again,” Darnold said. “It’s just those little turnovers we have to fix. We have to get better at that. I’m not playing any differently. I just go out there and try to play ball to the best of my ability, and that’s really all I can do.”
And for a second week, the defense couldn’t bail out the flailing offensive unit. The Irish racked up 262 offensive yards in the first half, with Wimbush tossing for 72 and rushing for 76 on his way to four touchdowns. Sloppy tackles allowed wide open runs, while receivers burned the USC secondary repeatedly.
The halftime trudge to the locker room was a familiar sight for the Trojans — grimacing with frustration as they trailed a lower-ranking team. But in South Bend, the second half magic was nowhere to be found.
“We’ve got to come out faster,” Smith said. “I’m not going to put it on anything else than the fact that they were just better than us.”
The defense only turned out one stop in the third quarter and allowed 21 more points. Notre Dame carved up the USC defense on the ground, with Adams blasting through tackles for an 84-yard touchdown sprint. Unfazed by the Trojan attack, the Irish sent in their backup quarterback with nine minutes still remaining in the game. 
The offense found some success in the third quarter, with touchdown passes to junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett and redshirt senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell closing the scoring gap slightly to 35-14. Yet although Darnold’s offense showed signs of life over those two touchdown drives, any momentum the unit had discovered ground to a halt when the quarterback took a hard ankle tackle in the third quarter.
Darnold had to be helped off the field, and although he forced himself back onto the field for one more snap, redshirt freshman Matt Fink took over in the final quarter to ride out the loss. 
After falling to 6-2, postseason options are limited for USC. Since Notre Dame is a non-conference opponent, the loss will not affect the team’s position at the top of the Pac-12 South. But after entering the season as favorites to play for the national championship, the Trojans’ hopes at the playoffs are likely dashed.
“It’s going to be a tough plane ride home, but it’s just adversity,” Darnold said. “We’re going to look at it straight in the face and try to get better from it. That’s all we can do.”
I’ve been an Irish fan all my life. (I’m 60)  Over the years I’ve watched the Men of Troy  put some serious beat downs on ND. When I was growing up it seemed ND just couldn’t win. The two times I can remember back in the day were 73 and 77. Loved the “green jersey” game. Perhaps the most bitter defeat was 74 on my 18th birthday. I don’t know if I became more upset watching Anthony Davis scoring again and again or watching Traveler running up and down the sideline. USC game is the best game every year. It is the best win or toughest loss. Hang in there Trojans.  FIGHT ON!!!
Ouch.  The air just got let out of the balloon.

In almost a complete turnaround from its last meeting, the men’s water polo team defeated the Anteaters 13-8 on Saturday. The last time the two teams faced off, the Trojans had to battle from behind before pulling off a victory in the last half of the fourth quarter. On Saturday, the Trojans secured a lead with three and a half minutes left in the first quarter and never relinquished it. 
“We played them [when] our  defense was a lot better,” junior driver Zach D’Sa said. “I think last time they scored around 9 or 10 goals and this time they only scored 6 against us really, so our defense was a lot better this game.” 
While the Trojans maintained their lead throughout, the Anteaters went on a run in the third, gnawing at the lead and decreasing the deficit to just 3 goals. However, USC quickly squashed their chances of a comeback as freshman driver Marko Vavic had back-to-back goals and extended the lead to 10-5. 
“I think we just kept having compound mistakes where we would have a chance on offense to make the advantage even bigger,” Vavic said. “And then we would miss that and go down, get ejected, get scored on. So, I think we switched and they had couple of those in a row and that let them get back in the game.” 
For the Trojans, it played out exactly how they wanted. They preferred being in the lead and forcing the Anteaters to try and recover, unlike in their last meeting when the roles were reversed. Some Trojan players noticed that UC Irvine’s spirits fell as the time began running out on their hopes for a comeback.
“It made it a lot easier on us,” D’sa said. “Because the team started to  give up and they got a little bit of hope back at the middle of the third quarter, but we squashed the hope.” 
The Trojans accomplished more than just winning the game. With nine players scoring at least one goal, they proved that they have strong depth on their roster. 
“It is definitely a confidence boost,” Vavic said. “It helps in future games for when we have big games and they will press out some of the better players, so they can’t score. It will give the other players that don’t score as much, much more confidence to shoot the ball and try to do their best.” 
Overall, USC’s offense pushed the team out of reach, but it was its defense that sealed the victory. Every game, the Trojans discuss the importance of defense, and this one was no exception. They look at it as an opportunity to keep pushing forward and improve.
“Definitely, our counterattack was our strong point,” D’Sa said, “and I think defense can always be improved. We can always stop them more.”

It started with a bad snap.
 It only got worse from there. The final score read 49-14 in favor of Notre Dame, and it was every bit as lopsided, every bit as painful, torturous and agonizing as one might imagine. 
 USC rolled into South Bend on Saturday night as the 11th-ranked team in the country, a fringe contender for the national championship. It departed back for Los Angeles with those hopes now dashed, the hype train completely derailed and the sense that this team ­­— in what was supposed to be a landmark season —was vastly overrated.
 We could have seen it coming. The Trojans were asking for the pummeling they received. Sure, they started the season 6-1 with a respectable lone loss coming at Washington State. But — as I’ve described in this column week after week — despite piling up wins, USC was not piling up confidence, nor was it getting better week-to-week. Almost every single week, we’ve seen issues with some key facet of the game —redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold struggling, wide receivers dropping balls, the offensive line falling prey to injury, the playcalling being questioned, the secondary giving up long completions.
 And on Saturday, in front of a raucous sold-out crowd of 77,622 at Notre Dame Stadium in primetime, every single issue that has plagued the Trojans this season came to light. It was like a dam that could no longer hold in the water that had slowly but surely been encroaching as the season progressed, and on the big stage in a historic rivalry game, the floodwaters poured through.
 Darnold was asked where he would start when he looked back at the film.
 “Play one,” he said.
 “Play one,” in a sense, encapsulated the season for USC. The defense had given Darnold and the offense an ideal start to the game, forcing a three-and-out and decent field position for the Trojans.
 But the first snap to Darnold sailed high. He readjusted to catch it, but as he pushed to salvage some yards, coughed up the ball at the bottom of the pile. Notre Dame recovered, and three quick plays later, the Irish were in the end zone. It’s happened time and time again this season: The defense hands the offense the ball in great scoring position, only to have the offense drop the ball —literally.
 After that sequence, there would be no more bailing out. The offense being shut down in the first half meant the defense was consistently on the field — and it was not ready whatsoever for Notre Dame’s rushing attack. The Irish torched the Trojans on the ground for 377 yards, averaging eight yards per carry. Running back Josh Adams came six yards shy of a 200-yard night, scoring three touchdowns and, at times, sprinting right through tackles or wide open gaps like the defense didn’t exist. So did quarterback Brandon Wimbush, who looked like more of a running back the way USC parted for him. 
 Sure, the Trojans had several key injuries. But that’s no excuse for Darnold to fumble or to throw a telegraphed interception or to somehow miss a wide-open redshirt senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. downfield, for reliable freshman placekicker Chase McGrath to miss a 27-yard field goal, for sophomore punt returner Jack Jones to fumble away a fair catch or for the entire defensive unit to forget how to tackle.
 There are the playoff-caliber teams who don’t make those simple mistakes, who take care of the ball and finish off the routine plays that can go a long way to winning a game. And then there are the Trojans, who have five-star talent up and down their roster and somehow look like a junior varsity squad against a team that they should match up with.
 Whether it’s shooting itself in the foot, bad coaching or too-lofty expectations, Saturday night’s game ended any debate: USC just isn’t very good. It was easy to overlook when the Trojans were winning. When they squeaked past Texas in double overtime, we praised Darnold for being clutch. When they only beat Utah by a point, we exulted in how stellar the defense was. The team never fixed the problems that led to games being close in the first place. They were never fully prepared for an unfamiliar opponent in Notre Dame, which may be far and away the best team USC plays this season.
 So, after an uplifting season last year when the Trojans had found “The Next Big Thing” at quarterback and everybody proclaimed, “USC is back” after the Rose Bowl win, it’s clear now that USC is not back, and it never was. Instead, it’s back to being underwhelming, to playing in the Holiday Bowl instead of the Rose Bowl, to continuously failing to recapture the dominance of the Pete Caroll era. 
 In the midst of the blowout on Saturday, media members in the press box bet on whether head coach Clay Helton would mention that USC still controlled its own destiny in the Pac-12 South and was still in play for a Pac-12 championship. And Helton did exactly that in his postgame presser, almost word-for-word, as did other coaches and players.
 Sure, the goal articulated by both Helton and Athletic Director Lynn Swann for this season was a Pac-12 Championship. And, sitting atop the Pac-12 South, that is very much still in play. 
 Still, it is clear that no matter how many games USC wins the rest of the way, its season will be seen as a disappointment by the fans, by the media and hopefully by the team itself. We were led to believe that the Trojans were better than this, that this would be the breakthrough season, that the return to glory was on the horizon. We were all wrong.
Before the game on Saturday, there was a magnificent sunset above the stadium, glistening in the twilight. It was an idyllic sight with the picturesque Notre Dame campus in the backdrop. But as kickoff approached, it faded away and the lights took full effect as darkness enveloped Notre Dame Stadium. The sun had set on South Bend, and three hours later, it would also set on USC’s season.

On Oct. 3, the International Association for College Admission Counseling — an organization composed of nearly 2,000 academic counselors representing over 90 countries — released a report heavily criticizing College Board and ACT, Inc. for their inconsistencies and lack of communication regarding the administration of SAT and ACT exams to overseas students. 
The statement in question focused primarily on international students’ lack of access to testing dates, citing that high schoolers in the United States were able to take advantage of twice as many opportunities to take the SAT (eight) than high schoolers outside of the country (four) in 2017. The IACAC also stated that this inequality is worsened by the fact that international administrations of the SAT and ACT are often canceled, and these changes are inefficiently communicated with test-takers and counselors. In response, both the ACT and College Board issued reassuring statements that pointed to improvements in technology and security, with College Board making plans to introduce an International Advisory Committee to handle such problems in the future.
In its report, the IACAC touches upon an important issue that has been largely absent from current discourse on education: U.S. applicants have decisive advantages compared to international students when it comes to American college admissions.
Although the IACAC’s connections between faulty test administrations and student inequality are understandable, the point highlighted in its report is one factor in an already existing problem — international students have difficulty getting into college regardless of the obstacles posed by College Board or ACT. This year, MIT accepted incoming class of 2017 freshmen at an overall rate of 8.4 percent but welcomed only 135 international students for a 2.9 percent admittance rate. A similar case occurred at UC Berkeley, where 8.8 percent of overseas applicants were admitted in 2017 compared to 19.7 percent of California residents.
Opposition to the IACAC may see no wrongdoing in this disparity, believing that American colleges should first and foremost be institutions of the American public. But this argument overlooks the invaluable presence international students hold on college campuses, specifically regarding their distinctive academic accomplishments — most notably in the STEM field — and the variety of cultures they introduce to the campus community. 
It is no secret that USC is a strong proponent for the inclusivity of global perspectives, as overseas students composed 24.1 percent of Trojans in 2016 — making the campus home to one of the largest international student populations in the country, second only to NYU. Because the IACAC’s claims concern such an essential piece of their demographics, colleges like USC and NYU have an obligation to at least reconsider how heavily they weigh standardized tests in their admissions practices.
And while solving the overarching issue of the admissions gap beween international and domestic students for acceptance depends on the specific university, finding a resolution to the IACAC’s problem is relatively feasible.
To begin, one obvious solution is to increase the number of testing dates available to international students, which would give them more opportunities to learn from their mistakes and boost their scores. Indeed, the current difference in the number of exams administered to domestic and overseas students can be interpreted as a reflection of unwarranted favoritism toward one side. In turn, the argument that colleges should use the SAT or ACT for the purpose of creating a standardized assessment that can easily compare different students becomes delegitimized, as a common “standard” can never be created if students are not given the same chances to succeed. 
On the bright side, overseas students can benefit from the shift universities are making to consider a more holistic approach when evaluating applicants. In fact, more than 800 U.S. colleges are SAT- and ACT-optional, reflecting a greater importance being placed on students’ achievements throughout their high school careers rather than how well they can score on a three-hour exam. 
While the aforementioned solutions to the issues brought up by the IACAC may not completely erase the disadvantages experienced by overseas students during the application process, they can help ease some unnecessary anxiety. The real progress comes from the universities themselves: colleges — especially those that celebrate their diverse student bodies — cannot call themselves global leaders if they do not first take into the account the interests of their own international populations. 
This is yet one more example of why being an international student is difficult, compounded by our complex culture and language. Welcoming and assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   Something that might help anyone coming to the US is the award-winning worldwide book/ebook “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” Used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors, it identifies how “foreigners” have become successful in the US, including students.
   A chapter on education explains how to cope with a confusing new culture and friendship process, and daunting classroom differences. It explains how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas.
   It also identifies the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here.
   Good luck to all at USC or wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who shout the loudest!

This past week, Indians across the world celebrated Deepavali, which is a festival signifying the triumph of good over evil, light over darkness. While having a traditional dinner with my roommates and a few friends, we joked about how this was our first social interaction unburdened by the stress of work since the semester began. Though said in jest, the realization that our lives were rather imbalanced struck an uncomfortable chord. 
For the most part, moderation has seen a great downfall in our everyday lives in the last few years. For instance, in politics, many are quick to judge centrists for not “picking a side,” implying the lack of unwavering allegiance to either the Democratic or Republican Party. In sports, lately it seems that it’s not enough to show your support for one team or player; you must also actively root against the team’s or player’s biggest rival. A Warriors fan who also appreciates the talent in the Cavaliers is labeled a “bandwagoner.” But perhaps the biggest destruction of the middle ground has occurred in our personal lives. 
As college students, we have a spectrum of responsibilities. Unfortunately, we are plagued by the theory that we can’t have every “S” in the triangle of school, sleep and social lives. Consequently, we get caught in a loop of overemphasizing one or two of those aspects, and completely disregarding the remaining parts. I have seen this most often during midterm season, when students — myself included — lock ourselves in our rooms to study, surviving on Red Bull and ready-in-five-minute meals; pull all-nighters to maximize study time, crashing for 12 hours immediately after submitting the exam; and spend the entire weekend hanging out with friends until the sun rises. In this model, the entire emphasis is first placed on school, then sleep, then social lives. 
A common counterargument to this imbalance theory is what I have coined the Make-Up phenomenon. I have interacted with several friends who will pull an all-nighter before a big exam, and justify this decision by planning for a 12-hour nap immediately after finishing the test. In this way, they claim, they are striking every part of the triangle. But moderation should be a daily implementation, not a weekly compromise. By arguing that our day-to-day activities eventually balance out by the end of the week, we are failing to address the toll those extremes take on us at the end of each day. 
In order to eliminate this issue, it is essential to introduce equal amounts of each “S” into our schedules every day. And to do this, we must find the moderation within each of those categories. Social interaction doesn’t have to mean going to the Row or partying all weekend; it can be as simple as setting aside the Easy Mac to have a simple potluck dinner with a few friends. An academic emphasis doesn’t have to involve all-nighters the weekend before the exam; it can, and should, be broken down into smaller study sessions and spread out across the week. By simplifying each category, it is no longer stressful or difficult to incorporate a healthy balance into our lives each day. Ultimately, students who ace their classes with sufficient sleep and healthy amounts of social interaction should be role models. 
As college students, we have a multitude of responsibilities and commitments that each take a significant toll on us. As a result, finding the middle ground in that spectrum is more important than ever. The Festival of Lights indeed enlightened me about the balance I hope both I and many other students at USC can implement into our schedules moving forward.

A group of 50 religious leaders, social workers and political representatives gathered in the Davidson Conference Center on Wednesday to recognize the growing issue of homelessness in Los Angeles. Among the attendees, over half a dozen different faiths were represented, allowing for very diverse discussion in a more intimate setting. 
 “May we and our leaders remember what William Blake once wrote: that to turn a homeless person away is to turn an angel from our door,” said Father James Heft, founder and president of USC’s Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies during the summit.
The event aimed to bring together leaders of major different religions, according to Heft.

Daniel Tamm, the interfaith liaison for the Los Angeles Mayor’s Office, spoke at the conference on Wednesday. Isabel Hanewicz | Daily Trojan
“For too, too long, religious leaders either didn’t talk, or worse yet, were enemies,” Heft said. “And what we did here was I think a wonderful example of what happens when the religions go to their core. They find at that core there is the obligation not only for love, but for justice.”
The keynote speaker of the event was Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, who played a role in passing Los Angeles’ Proposition HHH last year, which set aside $1.2 billion to build housing for the homeless. 

“I’ve maintained for a significant period of time that the discussion around homelessness, as it began several years back, struck as me being bereft of moral content,” Ridley-Thomas said. “It seemed to me [to] really understand what our charge was to be, we had to dig deeper and not just think this is reducible to a civic crisis but, more profoundly, a moral crisis.”
Ridley-Thomas spoke about his journey from a background in social relations to a master’s degree in religious studies and the profound impact it had on his future. 
“It was there that I first began to understand what the work of ethics was about,” RIdley-Thomas said. “One of the courses was called “Poverty: North American Style.” We began to try to understand what the interconnection was between income disparities, the levels to which human beings were subjected to institutional violence from an economic perspective, poverty or impoverishment.” 
Los Angeles County’s homeless population has increased 23 percent in the last year, according to the LA Homeless Services Authority.
“The opportunity is now for us to help a lot people,” Ridley-Thomas said. “It is unprecedented, and the whole nation is watching. We have a big job to do, and I believe with the right spirit, the right intentionality, the right purpose, the affirmation of the dignity and the worth of every human being, we can do this work and do it well.”
One of the main purposes of the meeting was to spark discussion to initiate change.
“There’s a lot of good will, but how can we make a difference connecting to one another? It’s not just a problem with them; it’s a problem with all of us,” said Benjamin Henwood, a professor at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. 
He promoted the Housing First approach, which allowed homeless individuals to be placed into permanent housing without any preconditions, as a, “person-centered approach [that] allowed people to work on what they wanted to.” 
Ending homeless in Los Angeles is one of USC’s “wicked problems,” according to the Office of the Provost, which creates initiatives that tackle the issue. 
“[USC] really [is] a laboratory in how our religious traditions can be part of a solution to the world’s great crises and not part of the problem,” said Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni. “The provost’s initiative brings together the research of the policy side of the issue with what we’re already doing, community service and the religious, spiritual life.”
The meeting also included a panel of two speakers, Emily Martinuik and Sam Randolph, who shared their real-life experience of being homeless, urging for continued advocacy for support of the community.
