I don’t drink beer.
Growing up, it was never a drink I saw many other black people around me consume. It was more often associated with the boys in my Southern town who wore camo baseball caps, thick brown boots under jeans and drove pickup trucks. I think back to family reunions; I believe my mom drank beer late at night after I had gone to bed, but the drink was never used for social pleasures — not even while fishing where we would usually break out a cold glass of lemonade or sweet tea. Even back at home, my grandfather has an entire collection of alcohol, untouched, that is still sitting in a fancy glass case. I guess it’s for guests when they come by and visit. It’s filled with various types of fine vodka, tequila in round glass bottles, and wines with names I can’t pronounce. The fridge in the garage has Coke, Sprite and even ginger ales for my nieces when they stop by. 
The only drink missing is beer. 
I spoke about this with Beny Ashburn and Teo Hunter, otherwise known as “The Dope” & “The Dank,” — two black entrepreneurs currently traveling throughout the U.S. to promote their business Crowns & Hops Brewing Co., which they hope to open in Inglewood sometime next year. 
“Storytelling is everything when it comes to creating a brand,” they told me. “We both have backgrounds in marketing and creative production and are dedicated to ensuring that the narrative of black and brown culture is showcased in the craft beer industry.” 
Ashburn and Hunter started by selling T-shirts that simply said “#BlackPeopleLoveBeer” and “#BrownPeopleLoveBeer.” The idea was to combat the stereotypes that black and brown people don’t like beer. And by starting out as a lifestyle brand, the duo sought to build a base of minority consumers interested in beer with plans to one day expand into a brewery to add underrepresented black and brown voices into the narrative of craft beer. 
“Exposure is everything,” they said.
Eventually, the T-shirts went viral. Black and brown people from all over the country united, creating a movement that requested for the beer avoidance stereotypes against them to end. Now Ashburn and Hunter are actively seeking investors, so they can officially open their brewery Crowns & Hops — “Crowns” as in royalty, a reference to the fact that all people deserve the best quality beer available to them and “Hops” for authenticity, for creating a beer that is unique,  bold and unapologetic.  
“Breweries are often reflections of the people that own them,” they told me. “If you have predominantly non-black and non-brown owners in black and brown communities, there’s a pretty good chance that the brewery will not reflect the culture of people of that community. We believe that it’s time for craft beer connoisseurs of color to see more establishments that reflect their culture, background beyond a playlist but in ownership as well.”  
I thought back to my childhood, thinking about the cultural divide which exists in the Deep South and why Southern rappers like the Migos and Kodak Black don’t make songs about sipping on beer the way Luke Bryan and Blake Shelton do. In the same ways country music appears to represent only a specific part of Southern culture, it also seems that beer is not as ingrained into black Southern roots as it is in others. 
I feel this is because advertisers do not market beer to black people in the same capacity as they do to white people. In doing this, beer companies alienate an audience of people who would probably drink it more, if our communities and culture had the opportunity to involve ourselves more in conversations regarding the beverage.
This is why Crowns & Hops made inclusion one of its top priorities. 
“We believe that people are attracted to things that they see themselves in,” they said. “Big beer companies targeting black and brown communities with only garbage options based on socio-economic factors is and has been a problem as well. Artisanal craft beer should be made available to anyone that has a stove with the hopes that they will one day be interested in brewing themselves versus going to a liquor store.” 
The duo knows of about 23 other black-owned breweries in the U.S. 
Crowns & Hops would be the 24th and Inglewood’s first. 
“We have a special relationship with beer as a means to connect people,” they said. “We love all the variety of beer than be accomplished with four ingredients: grain, water, hops and yeast. Making beer alone is a fantastic lesson in alchemy, and we love to share that story as much as we enjoy sharing a pint.”
The two chose Inglewood because of the cultural significance the city has for black and brown people. And, since they’ve started searching for investors and crowdsourcing, the duo has reached 50 percent of their fundraising goal of $75,000. 
“We give people the option to choose the best craft beer we can produce based on a lifestyle and cultural alignment,” they said. “As a brand, we hope to project love, community, family and quality. You can stereotype us with those qualities any day of the week.”

This week, learning about an allegation of sexual assault against the highly respected late abortion provider Dr. Willie Parker felt deeply personal to me. As a young woman passionate about reproductive justice and eager to support and destigmatize the compassionate work of abortion providers, I had always revered Parker, who is one of very few providers of late-term abortion in the South. 
His work and advocacy in a region that is (deservedly) notorious for its extreme political and cultural hostility to abortion rights have always inspired me and  reminded me to speak up for what is right, even when doing so is difficult and unpopular. But when a woman named Candice Russell came forward this week alleging she was sexually assaulted by Parker a year ago, I believed and still believe her. In progressive spaces that posture as supportive of gender egalitarianism, we simply can’t allow for “double consciousness,” claiming to support survivors of sexual assault and reject all sexual violence while simultaneously defending accused men and believing them over survivors.
Since #MeToo, which yielded an onslaught of highly public, painful stories of sexual abuse, many progressives and feminists have had to face several male leaders and allies of our movements who were not who we thought they were. Certainly, the rhetoric and policies of conservative leaders and the Republican Party are devastating for many survivors, but sexual violence exists everywhere and knows no party affiliation. 
For many cases, I am proud of how Democratic Party and progressive leadership have responded to allegations of sexual violence against their own, from former senator and progressive icon Al Franken to former Rep. John Conyers. I hope abortion rights and reproductive justice activists continue to speak out in Russell’s defense and fight for her justice. 
There is no reproductive justice without safety and justice for survivors of sexual violence and without absolute, zero tolerance for sexual violence in any form. Reproductive justice is the fight for determinism, safety and autonomy in one’s own body and equitable access to all the resources this necessitates. It isn’t easy to come to terms with allegations against a man who has certainly done much positive work in supporting the human rights of women and pregnant people. But this record of service and advocacy can’t be used to mitigate or somehow cast doubt on the voice and credibility of a woman who has so courageously stepped forward.
It is always worth repeating that women and survivors have nothing to gain and everything to lose from speaking up about their experiences. The vast majority of assaults are unreported for myriad nuanced and highly personal reasons, not the least of which include a culture of stigma, disrespect and willful refusal to believe survivors. All the while, sexual assault remains highly prevalent, impacting an estimated one in five women at some point in their lives. 
No matter the background or circumstances or profile of the man accused or the woman who came forward, when women speak up, we must listen, and we must do absolutely everything we can to foster an environment in which women and survivors are respected and believed. This positive environment for women and survivors must start with each of us, demanding accountability from perpetrators, regardless of our personal biases and preferences.

As the advisement and registration period for Fall 2019 courses begins, students are scrambling to find the general education courses best suited for their schedules. Advertised as a linchpin of USC’s undergraduate academic experience, the GE system imposes the same core requirements on all students, regardless of major. The most recent expansion of the University’s GE curriculum occurred in 2015, under former president C. L. Max Nikias’ leadership, and the current system is still dominated by efforts to meet requirements laid out in Nikias’ four-year-old vision.
But USC’s model needs further structural changes to provide students a holistic education while still allowing them to focus on their chosen fields. The purpose of general education is to allow students to have a broad, holistic look into other areas of academia. But students often find they are relearning material they had already covered in their high schools or are taking classes that are much more highly specialized than their past learning can provide context for.
Since the 2015 changes, undergraduate students are required to take 10 GE courses across eight categories — some students can fulfill the requirements with fewer courses by choosing classes that serve multiple categories or if they have Advanced Placement credit. USC requires a minimum of 128 baccalaureate units at the undergraduate level to graduate, and these GE courses comprise only a small proportion of students’ undergraduate course load. 
One of the faults of the GE system is that the credits accepted to waive courses does not accurately reflect what the student’s experience or aptitude in certain categories are. USC’s GE exemptions are very limited, compared to that of other elite universities. Georgetown University, which tied with USC in the 2018 U.S. News and World Report national university rankings, allows students to test out of all but one of its GE requirement categories through its broad acceptance of AP and International Baccalaureate credit. USC, on the other hand, only offers exemption from a maximum of five GE requirements through AP or IB credit. Only one of the 10 requirements — GE F: Quantitative Reasoning — can be fulfilled through an aptitude test. 
Even achieving this modest number of exemptions is difficult for students due to the University’s puzzling selection process for which exams it accepts for GE credit. For example, AP Art History is the only AP exam that exempts students from the GE A: Arts category requirement; this automatically disadvantages students entering USC from the overwhelming majority of public high schools that do not offer the relatively niche AP Art History class. Meanwhile, students who scored a 4 or 5 on the much more widely administered AP English Literature and Composition, AP English Language and Composition or AP Computer Science exams are not eligible for any exemptions.
An adverse consequence of the GE system’s onerous requirements and limited opportunities for exemption is that, with so many students all required to take so many courses, courses have proliferated and become less general in subject matter. 
The massive student demand for GE credit has resulted in the addition of courses that cover specialized issues and sub-fields rather than broad topics. For example, this semester, students can fulfill their life science requirement by taking introductory courses such as “Evolution,” “General Biology for the Environment and Life” and “The Nature of Human Health and Disease,” as well as courses centered around niche subject matter like “Science of Sport,” “The Biology of Food,” and “Drugs, Behavior and Society.” These latter courses are too specialized to provide students with a broad, widely applicable understanding of a discipline. But students also lose out on the benefits of a specialized curriculum due to their lack of prior knowledge about the subject, thereby defeating the purpose of the interdisciplinary foundation that the GE system hopes to instill in undergraduates. 
General education courses are necessary for students to explore their academic options and obtain a comprehensive, holistic education. But the GE system is in dire need of major structural changes.

Multiple senate resolutions, including one to push the University to adopt sanctuary status for undocumented students, were proposed during a USG meeting on Tuesday. 
During the meeting, Sen. Michaela Murphy proposed the Sanctuary University Resolution, which advocates that USC change to an official sanctuary campus, one that adopts policies to protect undocumented immigrants in its student body. 
Provost Michael Quick wrote in a memo to students on March 5, 2018 that the University has expressed its support for immigrant students, including DACA recipients, but does not have specific policies in place to protect such students.
“[It] can’t just be an informal conversation or an informal policy,” Murphy said. “It needs to be explicit, especially so that undocumented students and students with mixed immigrations status know for a fact, they know outright, that this university will protect them.”
The resolution specified that the University should prevent the Department of Public Safety from collaborating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and avoid collecting citizenship documents from students unless absolutely needed. 
Sen. Murphy also read aloud the VKC Flag Resolution, which seeks to increase the number of flags hung in and around the Von KleinSmid Center to better represent international students.  
The resolution was authored by Yusuf Irshaad, a senior majoring in international relations and Middle East studies, Amanda Chan, a junior majoring in economics, and George Zeidan, a graduate student majoring in nonprofit leadership and management. 
All three authors are members of USC Students for Justice in Palestine, a pro-Palestinian student activist group. Palestine is not represented in the 108 flags that hang outside of VKC. Irshaad said this partly inspired the resolution, which he said is not officially authored by SJP, as well as a general lack of international representation in VKC’s flags. 
According to USC’s Undergraduate Admission website, 135 countries are represented in the USC student body.
“When you go to VKC, you look around, there are open spaces that could definitely benefit from having those flags hung up,” Irshaad said. “There’s a lot of room to work with that.” 
The resolution suggests using open areas in VKC as additional spaces for flags, such as along the exterior, as well as the VKC library.
Sen. Jacquelyne Tan proposed the Learning Experience Evaluations Resolution, which aims to introduce a moderated system for USC students to access course evaluations. The resolution intends to replace sites like RateMyProfessors.com, a site used by students to publicly rate their professors on teaching ability and class difficulty, among other factors.
Tan spoke about the biased nature of comments against female professors and professors of color on sites like RateMyProfessors.com, which she said prompted her to push for an alternative solution that USC students can rely on. 
According to Tan, until Quick stepped into his position in 2014, students were able to access course evaluations through the Office of the Provost’s website. 
“I want it to be a USC platform and [for it] to be moderated by qualified people,” Tan said. “Some of the comments on ‘RateMyProfessors’ are extremely toxic and there is proven racial and gender bias.”
In addition to the three proposals, a minor technical amendment was made to the Terranea Resolution, which was passed during the last USG meeting on March 5. The resolution is now awaiting review by the Graduate Student Body and the University administration.
All resolutions proposed during the meeting will be voted on at next week’s meeting.

Three more victims of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall are suing USC, the Engemann Student Health Center, Keck Medicine of USC and Tyndall, separately from the more than 500 women who are already involved in a class action lawsuit.
The three women allege that USC knew about Tyndall’s abuse and covered it up during the nearly 30 years he worked at Engemann. Several lawsuits have been filed against Tyndall and USC since the Los Angeles Times first reported on the allegations in May 2018. 
On Feb. 12, USC filed an agreement for its $215 million class-action lawsuit, which detailed the amounts that will be distributed to all of Tyndall’s former patients using health center records. 
One of the defendants, named Jane Doe J.L. in the suit, attended USC from 2003 to 2006 and visited Tyndall approximately five times. The suit claims that Tyndall, in order to receive sexual pleasure, performed multiple medically unnecessary gynecological exams on Jane Doe J.L., all without  chaperones present.
According to the suit, Tyndall diagnosed Jane Doe J.L. with HPV, but this diagnosis was never confirmed through further examinations by other doctors. 
Another plaintiff, Jane Doe M.S., attended USC from 2011 to 2014. The suit states that the plaintiff’s pap smear appointment with Tyndall was the first time the plaintiff had visited a gynecologist in the United States, and she did not know what constituted typical gynecological procedures.
“Normally, this routine procedure would take no more than a few minutes,” the lawsuit read. “Instead, Tyndall spent an excessive 30 minutes to complete the pap smear in order to prolong his sexual gratification.”
According to the lawsuit, Tyndall also allegedly asked questions about the plaintiff’s personal life and sexual relationships. 
For plaintiff Jane Doe J.E., who attended USC from 1988 to 1991, Tyndall allegedly took pictures of her nude, which he told her would be used for medical purposes, the lawsuit read. According to the lawsuit, the plaintiff was told she had abnormalities and was encouraged to see Tyndall on multiple other occasions. 
“Subsequent examinations by other doctors have never uncovered the abnormalities Tyndall claimed Plaintiff Jane Doe J.E. had,” the lawsuit read. “[She] was encouraged to return to the Student Health Center only for Tyndall’s sexual gratification.”
In a statement, USC said it is aware of the recent lawsuit; however, the University is prioritizing settling as many cases as possible through the $215 million class action settlement.
“In addition to the monetary relief offered in the settlement, USC continues to make sweeping changes to prevent all forms of misconduct on campus, including establishing an Office of Professionalism and Ethics and an Office of Ombuds Services,” USC wrote.
The suit claims that USC concealed complaints made by female students and knew about his alleged sexual abuse as early as the 1990s. 
The lawsuit alleges that USC never reported Tyndall to the Medical Board of California or law enforcement during his 28 years working at the University. It alleges that Tyndall primarily targeted Chinese students because foreign students would be unaware of typical gynecological practices.

The U.S. Department of Education launched preliminary investigations Monday into USC and seven other universities named in the widespread college admissions bribery scheme an FBI investigation revealed earlier this month. 
The Department of Education, led by Secretary Betsy DeVos, sent letters to the presidents of USC, UCLA, Yale University, Stanford University, Georgetown University, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of San Diego and Wake Forest University informing them of the investigation. 
“The allegations made and evidence cited by the Department of Justice raised questions about whether your institution is fully meeting its obligations under the HEA [Higher Education Act], the Department’s regulations and the PPA [Program Participation Agreement],” a copy of the letter sent to UT Austin read.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC said it was aware of the investigation. 
“We have received a letter of inquiry from the U.S. Department of Education regarding its preliminary investigation,” the statement said. “We will fully cooperate with the DOE as we are with the Department of Justice’s ongoing investigation and will continue to comply with all laws and regulations.” 
According to the letter sent to UT Austin, the eight universities have 30 days to produce documentation of internal and student recruitment policies and admissions practices, along with promotional materials and records of communication between them and any organizations that rank schools, including U.S. News and World Report. 
In the letter sent to UT Austin, the Education Department requested that the institutions provide the names, academic records and financial aid information of the students named in the FBI investigation, along with any disciplinary action taken. The Department also requested the names and positions of employees charged in connection to the investigation, along with those of their supervisors. 
Led by the Student Aid Enforcement Unit within the Education Department, the preliminary investigation will determine whether or not laws and regulations surrounding the federal student financial programs administered by the Department under the Higher Education Act of 1965 — such as the Title IV, HEA programs — were violated. The universities, according to the letter sent to UT Austin, must demonstrate their capability to administer these programs under the standards set by the Department. 
“By entering into a written Program Participation Agreement with the Secretary of Education to participate in Title IV, HEA programs, an institution agrees that it will establish and maintain such administrative and fiscal procedures and records as may be necessary to ensure the proper and efficient administration of funds received from the Secretary or from students under those programs,” the letter sent to UT Austin read. 
If the investigations find violations of federal education regulations at any of the universities, the Education Department will determine the next steps, including penalties like cutting back on access to Pell Grants and federal student loans, according to POLITICO. 
“The Secretary may impose certain measures if an institution engages in substantial misrepresentation about the nature of its educational programs, including statements made directly or indirectly to prospective students or any member of the public that has the likelihood or tendency to mislead under the circumstances,” the letter sent to UT Austin read.

At only 23 years old, Dorothy Gilliam became the first black woman to write for The Washington Post. Over the course of her career, she helped cover the civil rights movement while personally overcoming challenges with racism and sexism. 
In a conversation with associate professor of journalism Bill Celis, Gilliam discussed her career as a black female reporter and the importance of diversity in media. The event was held as a part of the Annenberg Director’s Forum at Wallis Annenberg Hall. 
Gilliam began her work as a reporter at The Washington Post almost immediately after graduating from Columbia University. She later served as an editor and wrote columns for the publication, all while focusing on bringing black narratives and perspectives to the forefront of mainstream media.
“As an editor in the styles section, I was very grateful that I was able to help bring a lot of the knowledge of black culture into the larger society, the mainstream media,” Gilliam said. “I was able to hire black reporters that were very Afrocentric … I thought [it] was very important to make it possible for white people when they’re reading their newspapers … to read something that is very authentic about black culture.”
Gilliam started as a secretary at the Tri-State Defender, a newspaper based in Memphis. She said she was only sent out to report a few times before she was assigned to cover the Little Rock Nine — a group of students who were at one of the first schools to be integrated after the Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education.
Gilliam and a photographer traveled to Little Rock after she saw her boss at the Tri-State Defender on television harassed by protesters. She visited the home of Daisy Bates, the woman in charge of the school integration movement. 
“It was there that when I really started seeing the role of black reporters in bringing the issues that blacks face every day to a larger community,” Gilliam said. 
When Gilliam was working at The Post, she said she would often have trouble finding a cab that would give her rides back to the newsroom when she was on assignment in downtown Washington D.C. To make sure that she would still meet her deadlines, she said she used her secretarial training to write in shorthand while she waited in order to get a head start on her pieces. 
“[Working at The Post] was at first like diving into a sea of white men carrying two invisible weights, one race, one gender, that none of them had to face, and I wasn’t sure I could really swim,” Gilliam said. 
When Gilliam was traveling in the South, there was a lack of hotels available for people of color. She said that one time, she had to stay in a funeral home overnight. 
“It was frightening sleeping among the dead,” Gilliam said. “But that’s what it took to do the story.”
Gilliam said she was not alone in these experiences — other black journalists had to make similar sacrifices. 
“Black reporters … went places where white reporters never went,” Gilliam said. 
She said white authorities were wary of allowing black reporters to cover stories, so they would often disguise themselves and hide their equipment. 
“Journalism was a profession that opened new worlds, but it wasn’t for the faint of heart,” Gilliam said. “Especially for black reporters going into the South, it was like going to war.” 
In 1977, Gilliam’s father Robert Maynard founded The Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, the nation’s oldest journalism organization promoting diversity in the news industry.
According to Gilliam, the Institute has trained over 1,000 reporters of different backgrounds. The Institute also trains white reporters in cultural sensitivity in reporting on communities different from their own. Following the creation of the Institute, other specific organizations for different communities of color emerged. They came together for a convention in 1993 to unify the voices of journalists of color.
“At the end of that weekend, we looked at what did we have in common,” Gilliam said. “Everybody wants to … celebrate their own group, but you make progress when you find out what you have in common that will move everybody forward. Even today, that carries through. We must work together.” 
Roxanna Abdoli-Yazdi, a junior majoring in journalism, said she felt empowered by Gillian’s experiences. 
“As journalism students … we can get discouraged by the process,” Abdoli-Yazdi said. “But hearing how she went through the process and all of her struggles and how she ended up super successful is just really inspiring.”

The Center for the Political Future hosted a conversation Tuesday with former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Center fellow Mike Madrid and Villaraigosa discussed race in politics and the platforms of current presidential candidates. 
The event was part of the Center’s “Political Conversations” series where prominent political commentators and politicians  to speak about current political issues. 
Madrid started the conversation by introducing some of Villaraigosa’s accomplishments. 
“Villaraigosa started his career and professional life in public service as a community organizer,” Madrid said. “As [someone who has] marched for farm workers and social justice issues … working with the Los Angeles teaching union and served as the President of the Southern California Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union …  [his] fights have always been on behalf of working men and women, people of color and voices [that] have been marginalized.”
Villaraigosa, who served as mayor from 2005 to 2013, was the first Mexican American to serve in this position in over 130 years. As mayor, he focused on transportation, crime reduction, infrastructure, sustainability and education reform. 
Villaraigosa said when he ran for California State Assembly in 1994, he was labeled as a progressive politician before the word became prominent in politics. 
“I’ve heard it said that I was a progressive before the word became popular … [I was] championing issues like [banning] assault weapons in the ‘90s [and] the [broken] criminal justice system,” Villaraigosa said. “[It] disproportionately impacted blacks, Latinos and poor people.” 
Villaraigosa said some of the policies he championed were not as popular then as they are now. He said from the beginning that he was against the death penalty and in support of immigration. He said he focused much of his career on creating more opportunities for the Latinx and African American communities.
Villaraigosa described himself as a politician who is not just a representative of the Latinx community, but a representative of the community as a whole. He said during his mayoral campaign he was especially frustrated with the media solely identifying him as a Latino.
“I was never a Latino Speaker [of the California Assembly], I was a Speaker for everyone,” Villaraigosa said. “In a city as diverse as LA, I needed to be a leader for everyone.”
Villaraigosa said questions regarding his Hispanic background had a positive effect on the Latinx community. He said he was often asked how he could get elected with only the Latinx vote. He combatted these stereotypes by reminding the community that his heritage did not only have Latino roots. 
“I was born here, my mother was born here, my grandpa got here 100 years ago,” Villaraigosa said. “So why [did the media] keep describing me in that way?”
Villaraigosa, who recently lost his bid for the California governor’s seat, said it was “disconcerting” that the votes in 2018 were separated by race. Villaraigosa said the majority of white voters cast their ballot for Gov. Gavin Newsom, the majority of Asian voters for candidate John Chung and the Latinx and African American voters for Villaraigosa. 
Not all audience members agreed with Villaraigosa’s view on voting by race. Ana Charco, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, said that it was natural for voters to vote for candidate they most identify with during elections. 
“People see themselves in the candidates … I would vote for the individual that looks like myself,” Charco said. “Most of the voters have not familiarized [themselves] with the candidates and will vote with the familiarities of their last name.”
Villaraigosa discussed presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke and commented on his Spanish-speaking ability, saying that overall, he was not insulted by O’Rourke’s use of a Latin-sounding first name despite  not being Hispanic. 
“Good for [him] … he’s representing a community in the south of Texas, many of whom are Spanish-speaking, and [he] found it important enough, out of respect for that community, to learn Spanish,” Villaraigosa said.
To conclude the conversation, an audience member commented on Villaraigosa and Madrid’s opposing views on current issues, especially since both represent different political parties.
Madrid said that although he and Villaraigosa’s positions on political issues differ, they still care equally for their community.
“We share a lot of common beliefs about the poor or the need to help our fellow man, we just had different ways of approaching those solutions,” Madrid said. “What it comes down to is I never questioned where his heart was or what his goals were.”
India McTaggart, a junior majoring in philosophy and journalism, said she enjoyed seeing two prominent political figures overcome their differences to discuss political issues. 
“I think it was a lovely, hopeful discussion between them,” McTaggart said. “[Villaraigosa’s] political views represent what we should be striving for in both parties: unity, equality, inclusion, democratic values.”

Undergraduate Student Government President Debbie Lee delivered her State of USG address during a meeting Tuesday. During her speech, she reflected on her time serving as president since her inauguration last April, USG policies and initiatives she oversaw and recent national news regarding the challenges the University faces. 
“One year ago, I stood before you as the newly elected president, and time really does fly by,” Lee said. “So now I am grateful for this opportunity to share my reflections and thoughts as I prepare to transition out of this role.”
Lee, a junior majoring in political science, expressed her gratitude for the colleagues she has worked with during her time with USG. In her speech, Lee said USG comprises students dedicated to serving their community.
“There are no words that can truly encompass my time in this organization and for what this year brought,” Lee said. “In three years, I have crossed paths with some of the most incredible people on campus who deeply imprinted my life … Their unwavering passion and dedication to their work and respective communities have been sources of inspiration for me daily.”
Lee reflected on her campaign run with USG Vice President Blake Ackerman in 2018. Lee said after careful deliberation, their election team chose the slogan “Forward Together,” a phrase which has permeated much of her presidency.  
“As I reflect upon our accomplishment, hurdles and growth as an organization, I recognize that much of our progress manifested when student leaders and campus partners moved forward together,” Lee said. “This year brought forth many opportunities and victories, such as the establishment of the food pantry.”
Lee said she is proud of the Trojan Food Pantry, which was expanded from a virtual resource for students to a physical location on campus in February 2018 and has since grown to serve hundreds of graduate and undergraduate students in need. 
“While we still have many miles to go before eliminating food insecurity and homelessness entirely, I am hopeful in knowing there is a University-wide effort to ensure students who often go unseen are fully cared for and have the resources to meet their basic needs,” Lee said.
Lee said though she was proud to be a part of USG because of the organization’s tangible impact on the University, she admitted her term has faced its fair share of challenges. She cited the recent announcement of USC president-elect Carol Folt and the recent college admissions scheme as some of the challenges.
“We have felt the breadth and intimate depth of each one of these challenges,” Lee said. “Even before the slew of national headlines, we have been grappling with some of the most difficult questions of our own that have always existed and perhaps still remain to be answered by future leaders of the University.”
Lee said that among the difficult questions USG has dealt with this academic year, matters of free speech and creating safe spaces on campus have been the most prominent. USG navigated backlash and protests from various student organizations and communities to conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, who spoke to students in Bovard Auditorium in October. 
Debbie said, however, her most humbling and inspiring experiences have been speaking to students from various academic and personal backgrounds.
“While it is difficult to see on the front page, there are students both in and out of USG, faculty, staff and administrators who devote their time, efforts and even their lives to advocate for students and work toward a University that is values driven,” Lee said. “As the University embarks on a new journey of transition, students deserve a restoration of trust.”
Lee concluded her State of USG address by relaying the hope she has for the University to move forward with regard to transparency and accountability.
“My hope is that we too as student leaders should work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts with civility and grace, to remain steadfast in our purpose of serving others and to not point fingers … but instead uplift one another,” Lee said. 
Lee thanked her parents, who were attendance during the meeting, Ackerman and her fellow USG members. 
“To everyone who has shown me kindness and grace, when I didn’t deserve it, supported me and encouraged me along the way, and challenged my way of thinking. It is because of you that I will look back at this crazy growth-filled year with the utmost appreciation and gratitude,” Lee said.

For many college students, four years of school can seem to fly by quickly. For student-athletes, grueling workouts, travel and the rigors of competing at the Division I level can make it go by even quicker. In this series, the Daily Trojan sits down with senior athletes playing various sports at USC to discuss their experience over the past four years, from their athletic life to their academic life. This week’s senior is women’s lacrosse defender Jackie Gilbert, a team captain who made last year’s Pac-12 All-Conference First Team. 
Q: What is your favorite memory at USC?
It’s a lot of memories all together. There’s been so many things with my team, and all these experiences we have to go through are unique. Things like travel trips are really special to being a student-athlete and things that you can’t get back. I don’t have a specific memory that stands out, but being with my team, being in the locker room, just hanging out. Being down the street from one of my friends and being able to hit them up and go get lunch — those are the things that I am going to miss most when I graduate. It’s much harder in the real world to be able to hang out with your friends. I think it’s just the college experience.
Q: What is it like to be part of a relatively new program?
It’s [fun] to be part of a program that’s still growing and new. I was blessed to be part of the freshman class that still had that first senior class to come in. I got to see the process they went through, what they had worked through, and now, you go full circle to a new and different team. But each group that I was with has brought something different. This team has grown so much, and there’s been so many great times and great years. My freshman and sophomore years, we were really top. We had a little bit of a growing year last year. Again, this year, we’ve come back strong and [have] all come together. It’s  exciting to see the up-and-downs and now to be on the road to success, [to] be in a group that’s been doing well.
Q: Do you have any regrets from the past four years?
I’m sure I haven’t been perfect, but anything I haven’t done right, I’ve been happy for messing up and whatnot. All those lessons that I’ve learned have somehow helped me [later on]. For the most part, I’ve tried my best to squeeze USC in school and service and lacrosse, [to] try to get the most out of it possible. I’m happy with mistakes I have made because I’ve learned a lot from [them], so no huge regrets off the top of my mind.
Q: What’s next for you?
I’m a real estate major and business minor, so afterward I’m working at a company called Eastdil Secured, which does real estate investment sales and investment banking. I hope to try to continue professional lacrosse, if I can do it with my job.
Q: What have you had to sacrifice in order to be a student-athlete?
We do have to sacrifice a lot, especially if you want to be a top student, too. That’s the hardest balance — being able to have fun and have time with your friends as well as be a top student athlete and a top student. You’re going to have to lose something between there — not be able to go out as much and stuff like that. It’s all about balance. It’s all about knowing what areas are you strong in, when can you have fun? It’s a lot of learning. For the most part, I enjoy it. I enjoy the nature of having to juggle things. If anything, I’d find it harder if I had more time. I’ve appreciated being a student-athlete because it’s made it personally easier. The more things I have, I’m probably more organized. 
Q: What is your schedule like?
We have our practice block from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. Since I’m a senior, my classload isn’t crazy schedule-wise. In previous years, there would usually be class afterward from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m., and at 6 p.m., you’re usually studying and doing homework. If you’re traveling, you’re trying to fit in homework and all that, which is usually the hardest. It’s all about prioritizing and trying to get stuff done right away. It’s a lot, but it’s well worth it.
Q: Do you have any advice for freshman athletes?
My strongest advice when it specifically comes to athletics is to learn to go with the punches. There’s going to be a lot of conflicts, there’s going to be a lot of things that are going to come with being a student athlete, but learning how to take it and go with it and not sit in the moment and complain about it — that’s a big learning curve. That’s going to stop you a little bit from being successful. That’s something that every freshman has to learn. There’s a lot on your plate.
Q: What’s one thing about lacrosse that most people don’t know?
There’s probably a lot of things people don’t know. On the west coast, you still get asked, ‘What is lacrosse?’ and whatnot. Things that people don’t know about lacrosse are things that are more intricate to the game and what it takes to be a really good player and especially a defender.
But the good thing about our team and culture is everyone really appreciates each other. Our defensive unit is super close. When someone does something that maybe the crowd doesn’t notice, we know and we appreciate it. The game of lacrosse – the intricate details – are something that is still expanding on the west coast.
It is growing a lot. I’m from the Bay Area. I’ve been here through the growing of lacrosse from when I started in middle school to where it is now. It’s gaining a lot more popularity. I see more and more people out at middle schools playing it. There’s more and more recognition on the west coast. More and more people are getting to know about it, which is really exciting.

Word spread like wildfire that the Los Angeles Lakers were considering hiring Doc Rivers away from the Los Angeles Clippers to be their new head coach. 
The rumors seem unsubstantiated and a bit far-fetched considering the Clippers currently hold the fifth seed in the Western Conference. But they were serious enough that Rivers felt the need to announce he had agreed to a contract extension ahead of the team’s matchup against the Indiana Pacers. 
“It’s been kind of agreed upon,” Rivers said of the extension after the Pacers win. “We didn’t make a big deal out of it. I thought I had to, just today, because of all the noise that was out there … We’ll see. We’ve got a lot of work to do, but I like where we stand as an organization. That’s for sure.” 
And what’s not to like? When Rivers became head coach in 2013, the Clippers had superstars Chris Paul and Blake Griffin and a budding one in DeAndre Jordan. Over time, a talent exodus occurred, and all three were traded elsewhere. But, the Clippers have continued winning. Entering this season, everyone expected the team to be in tank mode. ESPN ranked them the 19th-best team in the NBA in preseason, with writer Ohm Youngmisuk forecasting: “While the Lakers and LeBron are dominating Los Angeles, the Clippers are playing the long game.” 
Boy, did that not age well. With a band of misfits, role players and rookies, the Clippers have exceeded even their own wildest expectations, while the Lakers have officially missed the postseason despite signing generational superstar LeBron James this off-season. 
The Clippers were supposed to be playing the long game, with hopes of a high lottery pick and the possibility of luring a free agent to Los Angeles in the off-season. They even traded leading scorer Tobias Harris at the deadline to double down on that prerogative. But when that move was made, something strange happened. The Clippers started playing even better than before. Now, they’ve ripped off victories in 10 of their last 11 games, including wins over contenders like the Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder. So much for sticking to “the plan.”
Much of the Clippers’ unlikely success story must be attributed to Rivers. He took a team with no true superstar and instilled in them a scrappy, underdog mentality. The players obviously responded. 
“The people they brought here have the same mindset, never were given anything,” said veteran guard Garrett Temple, who came to the Clippers via trade at the deadline. “We have a grind mentality, and guys understand their role. And we don’t have any egos.” 
A grind mentality. Egoless basketball. No true superstar. In so many ways, the Clippers are the very antithesis of their roommate, the Lakers. 
They had superstars and were expected to be a lock for the playoffs yet will miss their sixth-straight postseason. Since the 2013-14 season, no team has held a worse winning percentage than the Lakers at .327. Embarrassingly, the Knicks, Magic and Suns all have more wins over that span. 
So why should Rivers leave for the Lakers? There’s really no justification other than wanting to coach James and possibly reunite with Rajon Rondo, whom he groomed on the Celtics for eight seasons. 
Aside from those factors, the Clippers have made better deals than the Lakers, with executive Jerry West calling the shots. Unlike the Lakers, they’ve consistently won games, with the fifth-highest winning percentage in the NBA since Rivers took over. The only area where the Lakers have proven to have an edge is in luring free agents. But, this off-season, the Clippers too may take that advantage. The defensive-minded, scrappy, nameless roster seems like the perfect canvas for the soft-spoken Kawhi Leonard. Oh, and he’s from Southern California. 
Ask the average Los Angeles basketball fan, and they’ll tell you the Lakers still run the city. That may be true, in terms of brand appeal, but it’s categorically false when looking at the standings or the scoreboard (the Clippers are 2-1 against the Lakers, with one meeting remaining). With Rivers’ extension and the possibility of a brand new arena, the Clippers could go from plucky underdog to perennial contender. And it seems like Rivers wants to be at the forefront of that transformation.

No. 16 USC improved to 10-1 on the season after a back-and-forth victory over conference rival Stanford at McAlister Field Monday. 
The game came down to the wire when Stanford sophomore attacker Katherine Gjertsen made a goal that would have tied the game at 10 apiece with one second remaining. However, the goal was overturned after a controversial follow-through call, making the final score 10-9.  
Although the game was close, the Trojans appeared to be on top the whole way. Stanford never led after the 25-minute mark in the first half. Every time the Cardinal seemed to gain momentum, USC responded. 
For seven of the final 10 minutes of play, the Trojans led by just one goal. When USC possessed the ball with about six minutes remaining, head coach Lindsay Munday called a timeout to draw up a play for the team. 
The Trojans executed well after the timeout. Junior attacker Hope Anhut scored by coming around the crease and firing the ball into the top right corner of the net to give USC the cushion they would need to gut out the victory.
But with just over two minutes remaining in the game, Stanford junior midfielder Mikaela Watson scored for the Cardinal, again narrowing the Trojans’ lead to one. The Cardinalspossessed the ensuing draw and held the ball for a final shot to try to send the game to overtime. 
In their final possession, sophomore USC goalie Riley Hertford saved two shots, completing her new career-high of 17 saves. 
“I was surprised to find out I had 17 saves,” Hertford said. “I did hit a little bit of a zone.”
Hertford had a .654 save percentage and racked up four groundballs.
“Honestly I wasn’t really thinking anything at that point,” Hertford said. “It was more thinking about my defense and locking in.”
The stout Trojan defense held No. 20 Stanford offense to just 9 goals, short of Stanford’s average of 14 per game.
USC didn’t have its most outstanding shooting day, scoring only 10 goals on 35 shots. Three of USC’s top five scorers, senior attacker Emily Concialdi, sophomore midfielder Sophia Donovan and junior attacker Izzy McMahon were scoreless against Stanford. 
The Trojan midfielders stepped up offensively where the usual offensive playmakers struggled. 
Sophomore midfielder Kelsey Huff led the Trojans with 3 goals on the day to go with her four ground balls and three caused turnovers.
Junior midfielder Kerrigan Miller scored 2 goals and assisted on another. 
“We stayed solid, stayed disciplined and stuck to what we knew,” Miller said. “It worked out for us in the end.”
After falling to Stanford last year in the Pac-12 championship, USC proved that this year’s team is different with its victory. In fact, Miller doesn’t see any similarities between this 2019 team and those of teams past.
“Every year when I come on this team, it’s always different,” Miller said. “We have a tendency to compare to last years, but there’s really nothing to compare. Every team and every freshman class brings a new era of talent.”
As Pac-12 play heats up, the Trojans are positioned to head into the tournament as the heavy favorite. The win over Stanford gives USC a victory over every other team in the conference. 
Looking ahead, the Trojans will travel to Cal and Stanford this weekend for rematches of their two most recent games.

A Y chromosome is apparently a hot commodity on the art market. While this is far from a revelation, it’s an unfortunate fact that bears repeating. 
In one of my art history classes the other week, we were assigned to read feminist art historian Linda Nochlin’s monumental essay, “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?”, and it got me thinking. With her article, Nochlin essentially threw down a gauntlet and tossed a smoldering glove into the centuries-old art history hegemony. Even the title, provocative in its own right, implies that to engage with the query Nochlin posits, we must first accept that there are no women artists who deserve to be seen as great. 
Her answer to the question examined how the very idea of greatness is often defined to apply exclusively to men — in what she calls the myth of innate genius — and how a history of institutional conventions and social misconceptions has systematically squandered women’s success in the arts. (Just your everyday feminist stuff but decades ahead of her time.) 
“The arts, as in a hundred other areas,” she wrote, “are stultifying, oppressive and discouraging to all those, women among them, who did not have the good fortune to be born white, preferably middle class and, above all, male.”  
Art historians — the bulk of whom did have the good fortune to be born white, middle class and male — would like to have us believe women artists haven’t risen to the top of the art world because they are inherently lesser. 
But, Nochlin says, “the fault lies not in our stars, our hormones, our menstrual cycles or our empty internal spaces but in our institutions and our education.”
Evidently, nearly every line of her seminal piece reads like it should be followed by a metaphorical mic drop.
Her extensive feminist critiques, impelled by a missionary-like zeal, helped initiate new conversations and introduce new frameworks for gender and identity in art. Today, we are still collectively working toward rewriting art history based on the first edits Nochlin made. 
Forty years later, I, a young woman of color, can critically engage with these issues in a personal column. So, because Nochlin started the conversation and set it up so that I could have a voice, I’m going to close out Women’s History Month with a reflection on female artists who have changed the game and hazard a guess at what Nochlin’s titular inquiry means in the context of today’s art world. 
Georgia O’Keeffe was dubbed the first female American modernist and is notable for vulvar imagery in her paintings of flowers and landscapes. She was famously coy, however, about the confines of traditional feminine identity and denied not only that her flowers bore any resemblance to female genitalia but also that she was a feminist artist at all. But perhaps her refusal to engage directly with her womanhood is exactly what made her well-suited to spark the feminist fire that began brewing in the 1970s. As a woman artist who didn’t champion herself as such, she demanded attention from the men in charge and made them indisputably recognize her greatness, independent of aspects of her identity that would have made her easy to dismiss. Thank you, Georgia, for opening the floodgates for motifs celebrating femininity in art made by and for women and for vagina paintings galore. 
I also have to mention Yoko Ono, whose legacy as a pioneering Fluxus artist is often overshadowed by her relationship with John Lennon. Her performance “Cut Piece” — in which she invited audience members to cut her clothes off with scissors while she sat motionless and expressionless — was an intersectional meditation on the passivity of the female body and the aggressive act of forcibly unclothing it. Thank you, Yoko, for your genius and unabashed confrontation of the power of femininity.  
If anything, women artists are more daring and provocative than men have ever attempted to be. 
Thank you, Judy Chicago, for engaging with the role women play in birth and creation. Thank you, Cindy Sherman, for pointing out how female beauty is constructed by the male gaze in photography. Thank you, Marina Abramovic, for testing the limits of women’s minds and bodies and showing the world what we’re capable of. 
In the end, I have come to realize that greatness is a relative concept. These women may be deemed great in my eyes because I can understand and relate to their works, while someone else — namely the white, middle class, male decision-makers of the art world — may dismiss the same works as worthless. Ultimately, this harkens back to the structural and institutional challenges Nochlin pointed out that prevent women artists from receiving the same access to education or resources as men. 
Jenny Saville, who holds the title for highest-paid living female artist with a self-portrait that sold for $12.4 million, still lags light years behind the highest-paid living male artist, David Hockney, and his whopping $90.3 million sale. A recent National Museum of Women in the Arts survey of the permanent collections of 18 prominent art museums in the U.S. found that 87 percent of the over 10,000 artists represented are male. The art world must reexamine its leadership and consider how it still systematically stifles women by never even giving them the opportunity to display their greatness.
Now as much as 40 years ago, these vast discrepancies prove that there are still strides to be made. It’s a slow, painstaking fight erupting across industries, and the art world needs to remember to credit the woman who laid the foundation. Thank you, Linda Nochlin, for making sure there is more space in the art world for women to be greater today than ever before.

Live music blasts from the hidden corner of a Figueroa strip mall as crowds of people gather outside. Nestled comfortably next to popular breakfast restaurant Jacks N Joe, Tirebiter Brewery held a soft opening for the new establishment’s close friends and family Saturday night. 
After much renovation and interior decorating, the Bednorz family, which also owns Jacks N Joe, is almost ready to open its brewery’s doors to USC students and the downtown L.A. community. 
Owners Vianney and Mark Bednorz saw their chance to open a new business when the medical office that had occupied the space left. As a USC alumnus, Mark wanted to continue serving the local area, but the family didn’t know how or when. 
“We had always told our kids that if they have another idea that’s better than college, tell us,” Vianney said. 
Vianney and Mark’s daughter Isabelle took that to heart. When she was 18 years old and found herself choosing between UC Davis and Tennessee, two of the best veterinary schools in the country, she approached her parents with the idea of opening a brewery. 
“This is what I’ve known — I’ve grown up in the restaurant,” Isabelle said. “It’s a family business, so we dove head first into it.” 
Isabelle wanted to create a place that was inviting and entertaining for both students and local residents. With so much talent at USC and in Los Angeles, she wanted to create a space for live music and, most importantly, some good beer. 
“Downtown needs some love too,” Isabelle said. 
She described the place as a “labor of love.” The Bednorz family painted the walls themselves, but that was only the beginning. Mark individually handcrafted and cut the small wooden tiles that accent the restaurant’s main wall, and Vianney and Isabelle textured the paint behind the big “Fight On” fingers wrapped in cardinal and gold jersey material that hang from one of the walls. Lightbulbs wrapped around wooden fixtures dangle from the ceiling to dimly light the room, and a metal deer head hangs behind the small performance stage. The entrance to the bathrooms features portraits collected from places all over the world, such as Ukraine and India. 
“That’s what separates us,” Isabelle said. “Those little personal touches, the little ideas. It makes us different.”
The restaurant’s outdoor patio greets visitors with flowers and a cozy seating area that sits close enough to watch live performers through glass windows and doors. Posters of artists like Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd and the Foo Fighters line the entrance, where customers walk through before going to the bar itself, which features giant beer tanks. 
Tirebiter Brewery’s soft opening encompassed everything the Bednorzes wanted in the spot. Four acts performed throughout the night, including USC students Jessi Mason and Thaddeus Scherer. L.A. band Elovay and reggae singer Elan Atias were also part of the lineup. 
Bartenders served a few beers on tap, but they also offered wine and vodka. Tirebiter Brewery will eventually serve a variety of beers, including stouts, lagers, IPAs and ales, Isabelle said. 
“We will have something for the guys, for the girls and everyone in between,” she said. 
Weekends will consist of a “late-late brunch” beginning at 2:30 p.m. So when students miss the 11 o’clock brunches in town or arrive right after Jacks N Joe closes, they can head to Tirebiter for brunch, mimosas and an acoustic guitar performance, Isabelle said. 
During the night, the brewery will have a small bites menu that features a petite filet, homemade biscuits and ham, ribeye tacos and deep fried pickles, among other items made in-house. The goal is to have a menu that’s better than bar food, as well as to create a place that strays away from being a total sports bar. 
“I want it to be a place where you can bring your guys, you can bring your girls, you can bring a date and you can bring your parents,” Isabelle said. 
Tirebiter Brewery will open at 4 p.m. Monday through Friday, and at 2:30 p.m. on the weekends and stay open until midnight every night. It will be closed on Tuesdays. After acquiring a few more licenses and training its staff, the brewery is planning to officially open in mid-April.

For such a large, well-funded institution, USC has fallen far behind other universities in upholding sustainability standards. While Stanford University and the University of Washington — both of which have earned distinctions for environmental consciousness — have made distinct landfill, recycling and compost bins the norm in all their waste collection spots, USC only just started to install more recycling bins in select buildings. 
With its Sustainability 2020 Plan, the University is seeking to close this gap by diverting its waste from city landfills. To expedite recycling efforts and give back to the community, USC should partner with low income South Los Angeles residents to collect bottles, cans and other recyclables from campus and trade them into recycling centers. 
California has offered a rebate program for bringing cans and bottles into recycling centers since 1980, where plastic bottles and aluminum cans can be exchanged for $1.17 and $1.65 per pound, respectively. Through a day of collecting these items, recyclers can earn anywhere between $40 and $100. For many of them, recycling is more than about being environmentally friendly — it is also a key source of income. In an interview with HuffPost, Dalano Scranton, whose sole income comes from recycling at the A1 Electronics Recycling in South L.A., said this money helps him pay for hygiene products, meals and other daily living costs.
Recently, recycling centers across California have shut down, as global recycling market variables have been trending downward over the past few years, according to Mark Oldfield, CalRecycle communications spokesperson. Recyclers have been hit the hardest — many of them now have to travel further for less profit. One of these impacted recyclers is Heshimu Coleman, who explained in an interview with KPCC that he now has to travel five times as far as he used to in order to earn enough income — a daunting task without a car, especially in L.A.’s summer heat.
An easy way for the University to help is by pooling together recyclables for collection by people like Coleman, who rely on recycling to make a living or even involving recyclers in filtering out cans and bottles. Many recyclers are already sifting through trash cans around the city to collect their recyclables, and bringing their services to campus could earn them additional compensation from the University. 
Even though FMS sorts campus waste, and USC has provided student organizations with more opportunities to assist in the recycling process, an entire load of recycling can end up being thrown out if it is contaminated by non-recyclable products, such as liquids left in bottles. Instead of throwing these loads away completely, USC can offer them to people who need the recycling money, who can then exchange non-contaminated items for a rebate at recycling centers.
An especially lucrative source of cans and bottles is USC football game days, during which cans and bottles are abundant from tailgates. The University has already implemented a successful program for environmentally friendly waste disposal in the Coliseum, which has won top honors in the Pac-12 Zero Waste Bowl for the last two years. As for the waste generated at tailgates, the USC community has already begun an unofficial partnership with local recyclers, according to USC Sustainability’s waste diversion initiative. It is common to see an abundance of bags at tailgates filled with cans and bottles set out for recyclers to pick up. But both the school and locals who need recycling money would benefit from this partnership, which saves FMS and the recyclers the trouble of sifting through waste bins and ensures that the University properly disposes recyclable products.
By establishing an official partnership that extends beyond game days, recyclers would receive a more stable source of income, and the University would have a reliable way of disposing of waste responsibly across all of campus. In just one month at the A1 recycling center, over 11,000 pounds of recyclables were diverted from landfills. Considering that USC contributed 6,000 tons of waste to landfills last year, the University would benefit greatly from the help of local recyclers, who are already playing a huge role in helping L.A. achieve its environmental goals.
A previous version of this article contained an error. The article stated the CalRecycle stated how much recyclers can earn in a day. CalRecycle has never released an estimation. The article also stated that state reimbursement rates have been dropping. They have not — other factors are causing a downward trend in the recycling market. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The inevitable has happened — my vision is getting worse. As the child of parents who both donned glasses, I knew this would happen someday, but I hoped it would be in the far-off future. I blame the fact that I stare at various screens all day, so really, this is my journalism major’s fault. 
Don’t get me wrong, I’ve learned to love my glasses. They make me feel confident in a weird type of way. But, I don’t enjoy wearing them for special occasions, like going out or at my upcoming graduation. And my frames don’t particularly go well with the bridesmaid dress I’m set to wear at my cousin’s wedding in May.
So I went to my optometrist and got myself a year’s supply of daily contacts. I apparently have sensitive eyes, and daily contacts were the only kind soft enough to prevent my eyes from turning stoner red after an hour. 
I wear these contacts when I choose to, and then I throw them away. The rest of the time, I wear my glasses. It hit me one day during a hike, as I communed with the nature that I dearly love — I was contributing to the unsustainable culture I so despised by wearing these disposable, non-biodegradable lenses.
But my glasses are also made of non-biodegradable materials that would most likely eventually end up at a landfill as well. Which was better for the environment? I pondered, as I stared at a bird that was definitely staring back. 
Let’s break it down. According to a 2003 study done by Eurolens Researchers, daily use contacts worn 360 days of the year add up to 953 grams of plastic, or just over two pounds, in a year’s time. Monthly lenses, including cases and lens solution bottles, produce 549 grams of plastic. 
However, glasses use a varying degree of non-biodegradable material as well. But unlike lenses, glasses can be donated and reused by someone else.
“A three-year period use of lenses emits 163 times more carbon dioxide and uses 197 times more energy than the use of eyeglasses,” a 2015 Technical University of Denmark study said.
In addition, most people who use contact lens also have a pair of glasses for “emergencies” or when their eyes need a break from contacts. Overall, it’s clear that glasses are more sustainable than contacts, especially if they’re recycled. 
There are some pretty cool companies out there selling glasses frames made from recycled materials, and some are even producing frames created using plastic collected from the ocean. 
In the larger scheme of things, contact lenses and eyeglasses aren’t contributing that much waste. Even with the least sustainable option —  
daily contacts — only about two pounds of plastic waste per wearer is being created each year. That’s miniscule compared to the nearly 1,500 pounds of waste the Environmental Protection Agency estimates the average American creates each year. 
So, while being conscious about how your eyewear of choice is contributing to pollution, it’s also crucial to pay attention to how much waste you create in every area of your life. Especially since scientists are finding plastic in everything from fish to human stool.
