The Pac-12 Conference selected USC men’s basketball player Nikola Jovanovic to play for the Pac-12 All-Star Team that will travel to China this summer. The All-Star Team will play four exhibition games in China, one against a Chinese university all-star team and three against professional Chinese teams, on the trip.

The team will embark for the trip Aug. 10 and return Aug. 20. The group will leave from San Francisco for Shanghai and make stops in Nantong and Shenzhen.
The three professional teams challenging the American team are the Jiangsu Dragons, the Shanghai Sharks and the Guangdong Southern Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association. The Tigers are one of the premier teams in the league, and former NBA All-Star Yao Ming owns the Sharks.
Three years ago, the Pac-12 Conference launched a Globalization Initiative in order to help grow the brand of the conference in the international market. The initiative also hopes to give student-athletes participating in the program a tremendous educational experience by enabling them to interact with people of different cultures.
The Pac-12 team features thirteen players representing ten of the twelve Pac-12 schools. Arizona, Arizona State, Cal, Colorado, Stanford, Washington and Washington State all have one player on the team, two members of Oregon State made the team and Utah is sending three players as part of the delegation. Jovanovic is the lone USC representative on the roster. Utah head coach Larry Krystkowiak will coach the team. UCLA and Oregon are unable to send representatives due to the trip conflicting with the schools’ academic calendars.
Four of the thirteen players on the Pac-12 team come from outside the United States, including Jovanovic, who was born in Belgrade, Serbia.
Jovanovic, a 6-foot-10, 215 lbs. forward, played in all 32 of USC’s games last year as a true freshman. He averaged 8.0 points per game as well as 4.4 rebounds per game. Jovanovic earned starts in 24 of those 32 games.
Jovanovic had a .516 field goal percentage and a .761 free throw percentage last season. He was awarded the Harold Jones Memorial Award by USC as the team’s most improved player. The team finished 11-21 overall and 2-16 in conference play, failing to qualify for the postseason.
“I’m really excited to be selected to the Pac-12 team for this trip to China,” Jovanovic said in a USC press release.  “I am really honored to represent USC and the Pac-12 in the tournament and will give my best to help the team win every game.”

USC’s women’s tennis team capped off a tumultuous season on May 15, ending its 2014 campaign with a 4-3 loss to Georgia in the NCAA Round of 16.
The No. 16 Women of Troy (18-8, 7-3 Pac-12) laid it all out on the line against the No. 1 Bulldogs (24-5, 11-2 SEC), taking them down to the wire in a five-hour match on their home court in Athens, Georgia.
“They’re a tough team, they’re on their home courts, they were well-coached, they were well-conditioned,” said USC head coach Richard Gallien of Georgia. “And yet as the 16th seed — much undeserved, but the 16th seed — our girls I thought were remarkable today.”
USC fought tooth and nail, but put itself in an early hole but dropping the doubles point. On the top court, USC’s senior Kaitlyn Christian and junior Giuliana Olmos, ranked No. 49 in the nation together, stood up against Georgia’s No. 2 Lauren Herring and Maho Kowase. The Women of Troy put up quite a fight, but fell 8-5 to the Bulldogs.
Caroline Brinson and Lilly Kimbell clinched the doubles point for the Bulldogs with an 8-6 win over USC’s duo of junior Gabriella DeSimone and freshman Zoë Katz, suspending play on court two where the score was locked at 7-7.
“We didn’t play our best in doubles,” Gallien said. “And the team came out and just was terrific in singles.”
Though Georgia’s No. 102 Kimbell topped #118 DeSimone, 6-1, 6-2, coming out of the break, the Women of Troy showed great resolve in fighting out of a 2-0 hole.
Senior Brynn Boren, who transferred to USC from Tennessee this season, utilized her three years of experience in the SEC to crush her opponent, No. 15 Silvia Garcia, by a 6-3, 6-0 score.
The Bulldogs fired back with a straight set win of their own, though, when No. 20 Kowase topped USC’s No. 60 Olmos, 6-4, 6-0. With the win, Kowase extended her win streak to 11 consecutive matches and snapped Olmos’ nine-match win streak.
With Georgia ahead 3-1, the Women of Troy surged to tie up the score.
USC’s No. 92 Katz topped Georgia’s Mia King, 6-3, 6-0, on court six before Christian pulled off a grueling 7-5, 7-5 victory over Georgia’s Kate Fuller on court five.
With the win, in which Christian fought back from a 5-1 deficit, Christian finished off her career at USC as a three-time Pac-12 doubles champion and an NCAA doubles champion with junior Sabrina Santamaria, whose 2014 season was cut short by an ACL injury.
Christian’s efforts shifted attention to the top court, where No. 19 Scandalis was battling it out with Georgia’s No. 6 Herring. Scandalis had managed to win the first set, 7-5, but Herring bounced back and took the second set 6-1.
The third set went to a tiebreak, where Scandalis coolly fought off a handful of match points. But Herring, who had won her last 11 singles matches, pulled off the clincher for the Bulldogs by a 5-7, 6-1, 7-6 (5) score.
“I believed I could win until the very last ball that went by me,” Scandalis said. “I’ve come back from match points and won other matches in my life and I know how hard it is to close out a match, especially on a stage like this, so I knew anything could happen as long as I just kept fighting and kept competing.”
Though Scandalis was visibly upset in her post-match press conference, her head coach sang her praises and insisted he was proud of his team’s season.
“The level of pride I have in [Scandalis] and the rest of the girls is immeasurable,” Gallien said. “I think you have to be able to see the big picture and have to be able to not actually focus on tonight and this particular match but the whole year and how hard they practiced.”
Though USC’s season ended in the Round of 16, the Women of Troy had no time to wallow in defeat, as four players had been selected to compete in the individual NCAA tournament.
Both Scandalis and Olmos represented USC in the singles and doubles draw, while Boren and Katz also showed their stuff in doubles competition.
In the first round on May 21, Olmos topped South Florida’s No. 71 Loreta Alonso, 6-4, and Scandalis beat Duke’s No. 36 Hanna Mar, 6-4, 6-2.
In the Round of 32 on May 22, both Women of Troy faced higher-ranked opponents. Olmos matched up against Saint Mary’s’ Jenny Jullien, who is ranked No. 11 in the nation. Jullien was a familiar foe for Olmos, as USC faced off against Saint Mary’s twice this season, coming away with two victories.
Olmos didn’t play against Jullien in either of those matches, but surely got advice from her teammates who did. Olmos hung tough with the Perpignan, France native, but eventually fell 6-4, 7-6 (4) to end her junior season.
Scandalis went up against the No. 1 player in the country in North Carolina’s Jamie Loeb, and fell 6-3, 6-2. The San Diego native finished up her junior season with a 25-11 overall record after heroically stepping into the top singles slot following Santamaria’s injury.
Olmos and Scandalis continued to fight on in doubles play that day, going up against Alabama’s No. 4 Maya Jansen and Erin Routliffe. Despite only being ranked seven spots below the Crimson Tide duo, Olmos and Scandalis fell 6-3, 6-2. Olmos and Scandalis finished the season as USC’s most successful doubles pair, going 22-8 overall. Jansen and Routliffe went on to win the NCAA doubles championship on May 26.
Boren and Katz had better luck against their higher-ranked opponents in the first round. USC’s 16th-ranked pair bested Virginia’s No. 7 Julia Elbaba and Rachel Pierson by a 6-3, 7-6 (8) score.
The senior-freshman tandem advanced to face Auburn’s Pleun Burgmans and Emily Flickinger in the Round of 16. The Women of Troy fell, 7-5, 7-5, to finish their season 20-7 overall.
Though the Women of Troy were unable to repeat as NCAA doubles champions (a feat Santamaria and Christian accomplished last season), Gallien remained proud of his team.
“If we had gone out and competed poorly and were sort of satisfied with just getting here, then I would be sitting here rather disappointed,” Gallien said. “But I’m not at all.”
 
Gallien is not a worthy coach for the USC women’s tennis team.  He’s had some of the country’s top players, year after year, and yet in his 17 years as the coach, the team has never won an NCAA  national championship. The Bruin women’s tennis team has taken the national title twice in the last 7 years.  The Women of Troy and their fans deserve a better coach than Gallien.

Just two strokes separated the USC women’s golf team from capturing its second consecutive national championship last Friday, the third time in five years that the Women of Troy have finished in second place at the NCAA championships. Despite an individual national title from junior Doris Chen and a career-best final round from senior Sophia Popov, USC could not overtake Duke on the back nine at the Tulsa Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The top two squads finished well ahead of any challengers, with third-place UCLA finishing 15 strokes behind Duke at 25-over.

Following a come-from-behind win over Washington to capture the NCAA West Region, the Women of Troy seemed to be in prime position for another national title. Tulsa C.C. played more difficult than expected, however, and after one round the top of the field remained crowded. Oklahoma, which would go on to finish fourth, held a three-stroke lead over UCLA. Arizona State, Duke, and USC were locked in a three-way tie for third place, five strokes behind the Sooners. It was Chen who kept her team in contention throughout the opening round, shooting a 3-under 67, tying her with Stanford’s Lauren Kim and Denver’s Tonje Daffinrud for the early lead. None of Chen’s teammates were near par on the day, the closest being freshman Karen Chung at 4-over. Popov, the most experienced of the Women of Troy, limped to a 9-over.
USC’s hopes dimmed during Wednesday’s second round, as the team slipped into fourth place while the leaders surged ahead. Chung led the team at even par, followed by Chen at 2-over. Popov continued to struggle, carding another uncharacteristic 9-over, while sophomore Annie Park, the defending individual NCAA champion, added a second straight 5-over. Though no player shot below par, the Women of Troy collectively improved their performance by a slight margin, a good omen for the rest of the tournament.
Down nine strokes with just two rounds to play, USC had to make its move in the third round. The team received sparkling performances from Chen and sophomore Kyung Kim, who finished with scores of 2-under and 3-under, respectively. Popov returned to form in the penultimate round of her career, adding an even-par 70. Though Park continued to struggle, Chung’s 3-over gave the Women of Troy their first collective under-par round of the tournament. Going into Friday’s final 18 holes, the team sat six strokes back of Duke in second place, well within striking distance. After the round, USC head coach Andrea Gaston praised Popov’s resilience.
“I’m proud of the way she fought back today,” Gaston told usctrojans.com. “She’s been struggling in the postseason, but was able to put it behind her … She’s been such a huge part of our program the past four years and I’m happy to see her have a great round.”
The Women of Troy turned in their best performance of the NCAA championships in the fourth and final round, but, unfortunately for Gaston’s squad, so did the Blue Devils. It appeared that USC had fully recovered its championship form on the front nine, as the team took over the lead with under-par performances from Chen, Kim and Popov. Chen would slip up early in the back nine, however, allowing Duke to retake control. The Blue Devils’ Celine Boutier nearly took Chen’s national title out from under her during this stretch, but the Bradenton, Florida native was able to hold Boutier off by just two strokes. Even a heroic 4-under effort on the back nine from Popov would not be enough to secure the team championship, as Duke’s constant pressure proved too much for the Women of Troy.
Chen finished with a four-round total of 6-under, finishing the tournament as USC’s fifth individual national champion. She attributed her victory to an improvement in her short game.
“I was glad that my putts were finally falling,” Chen told USC Trojans. “The couple rounds before, I had stuck my shots close to the flag, but wasn’t able to putt in from a medium distance. I hit some great shots today and my putting was there, too. Most of all I kept myself composed and enjoyed the game.”
Kim’s 5-over was good for a 16th-place tie, while Chung tied for 28th at 8-over. Popov finished at 13-over, but was instrumental in her team’s comeback effort. Park seemed to find her stride in the final round, firing a 1-over, but it was too little, too late for the sophomore standout. The Levittown, New York native’s struggles were puzzling, especially coming on the heels of her second-place finish at the west regionals. Luckily for USC, Park has two more years to avenge this performance.
Gaston was quick to find a silver lining in her team’s loss. “Obviously I knew we had a deficit we had to make up,” she told usctrojans.com. “We hadn’t played the front 9 well all week and I knew we needed a fast start. They figured it out today and played incredibly well.”
Interestingly, 2014 marks the final season that the NCAA will use pure stroke play to determine its team national champion. Starting next year, the team title will be determined by a combination of a stroke play and match play event. Even more interesting? The 2015 NCAA Championships will be hosted in Chen’s hometown of Bradenton, Florida.

The USC baseball team’s 2014 season came to a bittersweet end last Sunday, as a series-clinching victory over No. 1 Oregon State was not quite enough to push the squad into the NCAA Tournament. The Trojans (29-24, 15-14 Pac-12) entered the year’s final weekend guaranteed of their first winning record since 2005, and many speculated that a convincing series win would earn the team a postseason berth. Though USC accomplished this goal with hard-fought wins over the Beavers (42-12, 23-7) on Friday and Sunday, the NCAA did not include the Trojans among its 33 at-large selections to the tournament.

Along with the Beavers, Washington, Oregon, Arizona State, and Stanford will represent the Pac-12 in regional play. USC, who finished the 2014 campaign with an identical conference record to Stanford and defeated the Cardinal twice in a three-game series, were reportedly among the selection committee’s “first four out.” Still, the season marked a significant step forward for a program that is less than 20 years removed from its last College World Series title.
Head Coach Dan Hubbs kept Oregon State off balance in Friday’s series opener with an adjustment to his pitching rotation, choosing to start sophomore Brent Wheatley over junior Wyatt Strahan. Wheatley had been torched for five earned runs in two thirds of an inning just three days prior in a start against Cal State Fullerton, but his short outing kept him fresh for the weekend. The move proved brilliant, as the Villa Park, California native held the Beavers’ stellar offense to just two runs to over six strong innings. Even with Wheatley’s gritty, emotional performance, the Trojans would need some help to get to Oregon State starter Jace Fry. That help came in the bottom of the fourth, when sophomore right fielder AJ Ramirez reached base on an error from Beavers’ shortstop Trever Morrison. Redshirt junior left fielder Omar Cotto Lozada followed with a single, setting the stage for freshman second baseman Frankie Rios to deliver a clutch two-run triple into the right-field corner.
With both starters on the bench and the score knotted at two, the game became a battle of the bullpens from the seventh inning onward. The Trojans capitalized immediately, leading off their half of the seventh with singles from Rios and redshirt freshman shortstop Reggie Southall. Senior third baseman Kevin Swick advanced the runners with a bunt, followed by a go-ahead sacrifice fly from sophomore center fielder Timmy Robinson. Freshman catcher Jeremy Martinez added an insurance run with a two-out RBI single.
Sophomore left-hander Marc Huberman was first out of the bullpen for USC, and delivered a clean seventh inning to earn his first win of the season. Sophomore closer Kyle Davis entered the game with one out in the eighth and navigated jams in each of the final two frames for the five-out save, his ninth of the season.
If the Trojans’ impressive 4-2 victory on Friday afternoon was a statement to the NCAA selection committee, Oregon State’s overpowering performance on Saturday was a reminder that the Beavers’ are deserving of their No. 1 ranking. Strahan was excellent for USC, even as he pitched a day later than usual, allowing two runs and just three hits over seven innings of work. But Strahan and the Trojan offense were no match for Oregon State starter Ben Wetzler, who captured his 11th win of the season with a dominating complete game shutout. Wetzler, who tops the Beavers’ starting rotation with a 0.76 ERA, scattered three hits over nine innings, striking out five batters and walking just three. Only Cotto Lozada, sophomore designated hitter Blake Lacey, and Martinez recorded hits for USC.
Strahan started off the game poorly, walking three batters in the first inning alone. The Villa Park native nearly got out of the mess unscathed, but two-out RBI singles from Oregon State’s Gabe Clark and Kavin Keyes proved to be all the Beavers needed for the victory. Though Strahan and sophomore left-hander Kyle Twomey combined for eight scoreless innings, only allowing one more hit, the Trojans could not push a run across against Wetzler. USC’s best chance came in the second inning, when Rios was robbed of an RBI double after a diving catch from All-Pac-12 right fielder Dylan Davis. The Beavers flashed the leather again in the bottom of the ninth, when center fielder Jeff Hendrix spectacularly robbed Robinson of a home run.
Knowing that his team’s postseason chances were on the line, Hubbs made another change to his starting rotation on Sunday. Instead of senior Bob Wheatley, the first-year head coach chose Kyle Davis to face off against the Beavers’ All-American righty Andrew Moore. Once again, Hubbs’ maneuvering paid off. Davis capped his breakout season with a bang, recording a complete game victory in his second collegiate start. The Garden Grove, California native scattered four hits over nine innings, allowing a single unearned run and recording 14 strikeouts.
The Trojans pushed across their first run in the bottom of the first, when senior first baseman Jake Hernandez’s sacrifice fly scored Swick. After Oregon State evened the score in the third, USC retook the lead in the fifth inning on an RBI single from Southall. The team added an insurance run in the seventh when a Martinez double scored Swick.
Though the win was not enough to keep the Trojans’ season alive, the seniors who were honored before Sunday’s contest can be proud that their class left a positive mark on what was once collegiate baseball’s best program. Hernandez, who finished his final season as USC’s leading hitter, Swick, the elder Wheatley, and the team’s three other seniors suffered through three losing seasons, a coaching change, NCAA violations and now the heartbreak of a postseason snub. But those six players can take heart in the fact that under Hubbs, USC baseball might finally be on the right track.

The recent scandal within the Department of Veterans Affairs has left the nation rightfully appalled. Story after story of veterans unable to receive necessary medical treatment — and the secret waiting list used by officials to keep this information hidden — have given the American public graphic and personal images of just how badly the government has failed our former and current military personnel. As the government’s largest employer, with 323,208 employees as of December 2012, a scandal in the VA is a particularly notable problem. The systemic issues that caused it, however, are not specific to the VA; the scandal is indicative of managerial problems throughout the government.
Dr. Jose Mathews, chief of psychiatry at the VA St. Louis Health Care System, told the Los Angeles Times that the data put out by the VA is “garbage … designed to make the VA look good on paper.” He described a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy regarding poor management in the VA to cover up not only the horror stories of patients unable to receive care for life-threatening illnesses, but problems with inefficient bureaucracy, inadequate staffing and corruption as well. That a department as essential as the VA is managed so poorly is cause for grave concern, but even more unsettling is that, as the largest department in terms of employees, we are only just now uncovering problems that go back decades.
According to the Washington Post, only 56.9 percent of VA employees feel as if they can bring up legal violations without worrying about backlash from the department, and only 37 percent reported being satisfied with the policies and management styles of the senior leaders in the VA. This seems to make sense, given the backlash against the VA for what has happened — other departments, however, show similar numbers that might indicate similar problems. The government as a whole did only slightly better, with 58.4 percent of employees feeling safe reporting violations and just 38.8 percent approving of their departments’ senior leadership. The less than two percent difference in these numbers shows that the VA is not the “bad” department in our government — it is simply the one being noticed due to its size and the inhumane consequences for a universally supported group: veterans.
Some departments in the government, such as the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Justice, are more polarized in the eyes of the public than the VA. Citizens differ in their opinions on taxes or on how our government should enforce the law, so when one group opposes a department’s policies there is often another group that supports them. Veterans, however, are a different situation; regardless of one’s political leanings, it is difficult to make the case that our veterans should not have their basic medical needs met. The wide coverage of this scandal can be attributed to the universal disgust it has elicited from Americans, and its particularly inhumane impact on such a highly regarded and important group. Fixing the VA, however, is only one piece of the puzzle — there needs to be a fundamental change in the model of how our government departments are run.
It should not take dozens of deaths over several years for government employees to feel they can speak out against the problems they see in their leadership. To solve the problems that plague multiple facets of government, such as the corruption, lying and inefficiency that prevented veterans from receiving the medical care they needed, employees must feel safe addressing the problems they see in their departments. Whistleblowing, however, is only the first step — we must be able to hold our government accountable for its actions, and change the parts that are not working the way they should.
Although many are calling for the resignation of Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, and he may rightfully deserve it, removing him would do little to change the systemic problems in our government’s bureaucracy. Without a system to keep these officials in check and to prevent the manipulation of data, scandals such as the one within the VA will continue to be an issue. Political gridlock cannot be entirely blamed on Congress or the president; the lack of accountability for thousands of government employees across several departments are a huge factor in causing the more specific problems seen today.
You can blame President Barack Obama’s hiring practices, Eric Shinseki’s leadership abilities or the individuals within the VA who refused to speak up, but the real problem here is the structural flaws in the government on a broader scale that allow such corruption and inefficiency — until this begins a process of change, more and more scandals like this one will be revealed.

Prior to the revolutionary period, a military pension was simply six years pay. The policy of promising unlimited access to quality health care, discounted loans, scholarships, pensions, and all the other benefits promised to veterans is too much for any government to afford. It is sad that many people did not get what they were promised. However, it is not surprising. Our representatives spend our taxes then borrow to spend more, in place of debating priorities and only spending the taxes on the TOP priorities. The VA should be decentralized and funded at the local government level in order to have real accountability. President Obama saying that he is angry and firing the top official is not making things better. President Obama brought in new leadership five years ago. The results are in: the VA is just as bad as when he took office. When the VA employees depend on local taxes to fund their salaries, they will become very responsive to local issues.

On Friday, May 23, a tragic shooting took place in Isla Vista, California, as 22-year-old Elliot Rodger murdered six and injured 13. Rodger began his so-called “retribution” by fatally stabbing three male University of California, Santa Barbara students to death in his Santa Barbara apartment. They were later identified as Cheng Yuan Hong, George Chen and Weihan Wang. Three of the men were roommates. He then went to the Alpha Phi sorority house at UCSB, where he shot and killed two girls outside of the house — Veronika Elizabeth Weiss and Katherine Breann Cooper. He later shot Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez to death outside of a deli market. All six killed were UCSB students. Many others were injured as he fired shots out of his car window while driving.
Design by Grace Wang
 
Prior to the slaughter, Elliot had recorded and uploaded a YouTube video and written a 137-page manifesto, outlining his slaughter plan and explaining his reasoning. According to the video and manifesto, Elliot wanted “retribution” because he was sick of what he perceived as brutal and twisted humanity, in particular women who rejected him and caused his loneliness. He described college as a time “when everyone experiences those things such as sex and fun and pleasure,” yet he was still a virgin who “had to rot in loneliness.” Elliot condemned the girls and blamed them, as well as other popular kids, for his tragic life. He specifically pointed out his crush in middle school as his initial motivation for the rampage. He said the girl had started his hatred for all girls and made him believe girls were “mean, cruel and heartless creatures that took pleasure from [his] suffering.” He was bitter about humanity because he thought of himself as “the supreme gentleman” and the “perfect guy,” yet he was sick of “spoiled, stuck-up blond [sluts]” viewing him as “inferior” and throwing themselves at “obnoxious brutes.” He planned to punish humanity, as he believed “the males [deserved] to be punished for living a better and more pleasurable life than [him], and the females [deserved] to be punished for giving that pleasurable life to those males instead of [him].”
Now, we are told that Elliot had a severe mental illness, had been in therapy since childhood, and probably should have received greater care and attention for his illness during his time at Santa Barbara. But his mental illness alone cannot explain his actions; in fact, no single explanation can. Since his rampage, there have been many arguments made regarding misogynistic society, gender discrimination, gun control, mental illness and other issues. What I would like to focus on here is how Elliot’s rationale for his killing spree not only revolves around men being entitled to women, but also included plenty of complaints about girls not wanting him even though he was better than other men. This mentality reminds me of the “nice guys finish last” concept that frustrates many. In our society, especially now that monogamy is no longer necessarily the norm on college campuses, we often hear people complain about how girls go for jerks and “friendzone” guys that are perhaps more gentlemanly. The idea that girls should choose guys that attempt to be nicer could easily be one of Elliot’s driving thoughts. As I mentioned earlier, he called himself “perfect” and “the supreme gentleman,” and hence wanted to show popular girls and guys that he was in truth “the superior one.”
The problem with this “nice guys being friendzoned” theory, which Rodger may very well have held based on his writing, is that even though he wanted to treat girls well and with respect, that does not entitle him to girls who are not interested. Men may think that by being a “gentleman,” they are not practicing discrimination against women, but that behavior does not obligate any woman to choose them. If they assume that it does, and criticize the women around them for not being with their “gentlemanly” selves, that’s sexist and wrong on their part. By assuming that good behavior entitles them to the women they claim to respect, they are in fact discriminating against those very women. This is not to say that all guys who are nice to girls have this double-standard mentaility, and it is definitely not to say that every guy who thinks nice guys should get the girls necessarily pose great danger to our community. This tragic incident, however, should urge us to reconsider the gender roles, stereotypes and negative social paradigms that are disappointingly still prevalent on many college campuses.

From Snow White’s vainglorious Evil Queen to 101 Dalmatians’ felonious fur fetishist Cruella de Vil to Ursula the show-tune-belting sea witch in The Little Mermaid, Disney has conjured up some of the most iconic female villains in cinema history. For the better part of eight decades, these licentious ladies and murderous mademoiselles have schemed, stolen and shape-shifted their way into the darkest corners of our hearts.
Black Magic Woman · Robert Stromberg’s Maleficent is the latest attempt to provide a memorable villain with a sympathetic back-story. – Photo courtesy of Walt Disney Pictures
 
During that time, however, one she-devil has held dominion over all: Maleficent, the spiteful sorceress from Walt Disney’s 1959 adaptation of Sleeping Beauty. Now, 55 years later, the self-proclaimed Mistress of All Evil is finally getting to tell her side of the story thanks to Angelina Jolie and Robert Stromberg’s grim-looking fantasy adventure Maleficent, scheduled for release this Friday.
Dressed from head to toe in billowing robes of black and purple and crowned in her signature horned headdress, Maleficent has become one of the most enduring and popular villains in the Disney stable. In addition to Marc Davis’ striking character design and the deliciously wicked voice of the great Eleanor Audley, the same actress who lent her sinister pipes to the sadistic stepmother Lady Tremaine in Cinderella, the dark fairy also boasts one of the most frighteningly straightforward motivations in all of fiction: her entire rationale for cursing the innocent Princess Aurora with the promise of death-like slumber and plunging an entire kingdom into anarchy and despair stems from a perceived slight over not being invited to the young girl’s christening. How’s that for holding a grudge?
The 1959 film has had an indelible impact on generations of impressionable children, including a young Jolie, who reportedly counts Maleficent as her favorite Disney character. With her imperious cheekbones, withering stare and glamorous physicality, the 38-year-old actress certainly seems like an ideal fit for the role. Early screenshots showing her in full costume generated a great deal of excitement on Twitter and the blogosphere, as did a 90-second trailer that aired during the Grammys last January.
The trailer, which featured a quietly menacing cover of the original film’s wistful anthem “Once Upon a Dream” sung by funereal songbird Lana Del Rey (who was handpicked by Jolie to contribute to the soundtrack), made the new movie’s revisionist intentions abundantly clear: the fairy tale version of Sleeping Beauty we grew up with is little more than an abridged morality play, one that barely scratches the surface of a darker, infinitely more complex saga of betrayal and revenge surrounding Maleficent and Aurora’s father King Stefan, played by District 9 star Sharlto Copley, who appears much less benevolent this time around. It’s an interesting premise all right, if hardly an original one.
Whether we’re talking about heroes or villains, “secret origins” are nothing new. The Broadway play Wicked recast the Wicked Witch of the West as a misunderstood victim of prejudice, while George Lucas’ Star Wars prequels revealed the fearsome Darth Vader as a tragic figure who is manipulated into sacrificing his humanity in order to save his wife and unborn children. The new Amazing Spider-Man series initially justified its existence by promising to tell us “the untold story” behind the disappearance of Peter Parker’s parents, but the answer ultimately cheapened the character’s origin by making his superpowers a genetic inheritance instead of a simple twist of fate.
When it comes to great villains, less is often more. Saddling a first-class antagonist with an unnecessary or hastily constructed back-story can rob them of their mystique, turning them from villain to victim in the space of a few ham-fisted flashbacks. Analyze a fascinating character too closely and you risk diluting what made them so fascinating to begin with.
One of the best recent examples is Hannibal Lecter. Thomas Harris, the author responsible for immortalizing the gentleman cannibal’s grisly exploits in Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, ultimately went too far in delving into Dr. Lecter’s traumatic past in Hannibal Rising, an ill-advised prequel that risked turning the enigmatic horror icon into just another vigilante with blood in his eyes. Thankfully the TV series starring Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen, which just finished its second season, has made major inroads in restoring the character to his former inscrutable glory, even adding a Mephistophelian subtext that was missing from previous big-screen incarnations.
There are exceptions to this rule, of course. TV writer Paul Dini, who did an uncredited pass on Linda Woolverton’s Maleficent screenplay, has a universally-acknowledged reputation for being able to give bad guys sympathetic back-stories without interfering with their evil mojo. In fact, he often imbues these characters with an aching, delicate humanity that makes their inhuman actions seem all the more grotesque by comparison. His work on Batman: The Animated Series speaks for itself, specifically the Emmy-winning Mr. Freeze episode “Heart of Ice,” which took a ridiculous, gimmicky villain and made the viewer feel every ounce of his secret pain.
Stromberg and Jolie’s version of Maleficent behaves like a wrathful earth mother, one who is fiercely devoted to the supernatural inhabitants of the moors that surround King Stefan’s kingdom. So why turn a classical villain into an avenging eco-angel — no kidding, she occasionally sprouts angel wings — and risk alienating her sizable fan-base? The answer is simple: it’s unrealistic to expect the Mouse House to produce a $180 million movie revolving around a character who’s pure evil. Yes, it’s awesome to fantasize about a series of villain-fronted Disney movies — The Gaston Story starring Bruce Campbell! An Ursula musical directed by John Waters! — but we’re still dealing with the company that practically invented the phrase family-friendly. So, like it or lump it, Maleficent is probably going to have to trade in her villain card for a temporary anti-hero license. Preferably long after she transforms into a giant fire-breathing dragon.

The Arts District is developing a reputation for taking the hardnosed rustic overtones of the surrounding industrial complexes and subtly ushering in high-end restaurants and shops. Take, for instance, the Biscuit Company Lofts and venerated French bistro Church and State situated at the center of a host of warehouse buildings. Bestia, which serves up some of the city’s best cured meats and charcuterie selections, sits a block away from a recycling plant.
Nice without spice · The Spanish egg casserole is a surprisingly light-yet-savory dish that should be a favorite among Zinc Cafe’s guests. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
Excellent food doesn’t necessarily mean the prettiest location, so for a café and market like the newly opened Zinc Café to transfer a concept from the picturesque shores of Laguna Beach and Corona Del Mar, California to the brick-and-concrete jungles of Los Angeles’ industrial underbelly, it would have to have well-executed food to compensate. Luckily, Zinc Café has exactly the type of solid execution in everyday fare to become a staple for Arts District locals.
The first impression upon walking into Zinc Café is that it’s spacious — ample al fresco seating lines the pathway to the entrance, with another charming patio with trees and even more outdoor seating. Natural light spills in from attractive, floor-to-ceiling windows and illuminates whitewashed wooden booths smartly contrasted with stainless steel tables.  The café’s aesthetic operates more as a gorgeous respite from its heavily industrialized surroundings.
The food doesn’t quite live up to Zinc Café’s amazing made-for-brunch ambiance, but this is an admittedly tall order — the offerings are plenty serviceable. A Belgian waffle arrives lightly dusted with powdered sugar, topped with seasonal berries and a citrus-adulterated whipped cream. The waffle errs on the cakey side, without a crunchy shell to offer a contrastive texture balance. It’s fluffy and soft throughout and eats more like a dessert than a staple of a late-morning brunch menu.
On the savory side, an omelette of asparagus and mushrooms is buttery without being too hefty or greasy. The oyster and shiitake mushrooms play a starring role, adding an earthy and savory element that’s counterbalanced by the tang of freshly melted goat cheese. The execution on the egg is a bit sloppy, with the ingredients peeking out through various perforations on the underside of the omelette, indicative of a bit of rushed execution. It’s a minor oversight in an altogether satisfying dish that’s served up with wheat toast and fresh berries.
Another satisfying savory option is the Spanish egg casserole, which comes served in a small bowl topped with a perfectly cooked egg. A hint of spice and nice sweetness from the chopped peppers is given a rich boost when mixed with the yolk of the egg. Any subtlety of flavors attempted is drowned out by the casserole itself, which strongly resembles an American chili casserole. Again, the execution is a little off the mark; one baton of a julienned pepper stretched out to almost an inch and an eighth in length, while others were uniformly chopped to much smaller, bite-sized pieces. This casserole is served with white toast points and tasty enough that the portion may seem a little too small.
In spite of the rushed execution on some of the savory dishes, it bears mentioning that the food itself has the flavor profiles and the balance to win over most diners. The strong, earthy house coffee is pairs brilliantly with any of Zinc’s breakfast offerings and could go toe to toe with any Joe in the neighborhood— which is nothing to sneeze at, given that the area that boasts both Stumptown Coffee Roasters and a Handsome Coffee (soon to be Blue Bottle Coffee) location within walking distance.
With its gorgeous expansive décor, solidly executed food and a cocktail and beverage list worthy of any upscale brunch haunt in Newport Beach, Zinc Café should be a welcome addition to the Arts District dining scene.

Keck Hospital of USC has sued the California-based healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente for not paying a $544,000 hospital bill accrued by one of its patients for open-heart surgery, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The lawsuit, which was filed on May 15 in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, states that Kaiser Permanente did not notify Keck prior to the surgery that the patient had used up a $75,000 limit on their insurance benefits.
USC states in the lawsuit that the patient was treated in October 2013 and in December of that same year, Kaiser declined to pay for the Keck Hospital treatment.
Keck and Kaiser Permanente have been in an agreement since 1994 for USC to treat certain Kaiser patients for which Kaiser would pay for, the lawsuit states.
In a statement, Kaiser Permanente maintains that Keck was previously aware of the coverage cap.
“We are confident that Keck’s allegation that it was not informed about coverage limits is not accurate,” the statement said.

For many students, summer offers a much-needed break. But for Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Rini Sampath, breaks come later. She and USG President Andrew Menard will spend the next few months laying the groundwork to implement policy changes they campaigned on this past spring.

“The summer is the perfect time to sow the seeds of what we want to accomplish in the fall semester,” Sampath said.
Sampath, who is also interning at a law firm and a political campaign, will spend 35 hours in the USG offices this summer, a figure that excludes meetings with student organizations and administrative officials. However, she’s unfazed by the time commitment.
“It’ll probably end up being more time than that,” she said, laughing.
This push during the summer months will focus on policy changes, particularly those emphasized by Sampath and Menard during their run this past semester. Each policy change presents unique challenges.
For example, the duo is pushing for a proposal that would allow re-entry to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during athletic events, and meeting with USC administrators about this is crucial, Sampath said. Several other Pac-12 universities have a re-entry policy in place for home football games.
“We want to see if this issue has been brought up in the past, and find out what the reasons for the current no re-entry policy are,” Sampath said.
She also noted that current policies are not always communicated effectively to students. Menard and Sampath promised an increase in resources for sexual assault victims in their campaign, but upon taking office, they were surprised to learn that resources were already available.
“We definitely need to work on communication,” Sampath said.
In looking to increase awareness of sexual assault, Sampath says that UCLA’s 7000 in Solidarity campaign is a good model.
“Yes, they’re our rival,” Sampath said. “But they have some very effective solutions to this issue.”
7000 in Solidarity raises awareness through online and    on-campus promotion, and features an easily recognizable logo. Sampath was quick to point out that a good awareness campaign, like a good political campaign, needs good branding.
“You recognize the logo and you recognize the issue,” Sampath said.
Another promotional initiative for USG this fall is a planned cultural fair to showcase diversity on campus. Menard and Sampath will oversee the directors of USG’s Diversity Affairs committee in planning the event.
“I plan to sit down and give them initiative … [but] we give as much creative reign as possible to the directors,” Sampath said.
A final, more personal goal for Sampath is developing a better network for spring admits. As a spring admit herself, Sampath knows the challenges of adapting as a freshman in the middle of the academic year.
“I experienced it firsthand,” Sampath said. “We don’t have that Welcome Week experience, roaming the dining hall and getting numbers.”
Sampath has met with Katharine Harrington, vice president of admissions and planning, and aims to develop a network in which spring admits are paired with other USC students to ease the transition process.
Overall, Sampath views her summer work not as an added burden, but as a means of bringing her and Menard’s dreams for USC to fruition.
“We have full faith in all of these projects,” Sampath said.

Repairs are currently underway for “Youth Triumphant,” the fountain in front of Doheny Memorial Library that was damaged during the senior fountain run that took place Thursday, May 1.
Restored · “The Youth Triumphant” fountain (above) is now almost fully repaired after sustaining significant damages during the annual fountain run — a tradition where seniors attempt to run to all of the campus’ 30 fountains. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The fountain run is an annual tradition during which graduating seniors attempt to run to all of the campus’ 30 fountains.
George Huber, maintenance manager for USC Facilities Management Services, said in a statement to the Daily Trojan that the estimated damage from the event is in the thousands of dollars.
“As of now work to the fountain is ongoing, therefore final costs for the [Youth Triumphant] repairs are yet to be determined,” Huber said. “However, in consideration of the damage observed, we estimate the total cost to be at least $20,000.”
Huber said that Griswold Conservation Associates is being contracted to repair the damage to the “Youth Triumphant,” also known as the Prentiss Memorial Fountain. “Youth Triumphant,” however, wasn’t the only thing damaged during the annual senior tradition.
“In addition to damages to the Prentiss Fountain, many other campus fountains had minor damage following this year’s Fountain Run,” Huber said. “Also, several campus planters needed to be re-planted, and extensive cleanup of the university’s fountains and grounds was necessary.”
The Prentiss Memorial Fountain was donated to USC in 1935 by Mr. and Mrs. Carman-Ryles in memory of their son, Edward L. Prentiss. The fountain is known as “Youth Triumphant” and “The Four Cornerstones of American Democracy” with kneeling figures on the fountain representing home, school, community and church. Because of Commencement, certain repairs to the fountain had to be prioritized.
“The repair to the Prentiss Fountain is multi-phase,” he said. “First, we quickly moved into temporarily mending the bronze figurine in order to have it intact for Commencement. We are now working on permanent repairs; several broken concrete features will need to be formed and                    re-attached.”
Students disapproved of damage to the fountain, but felt the administration should be understanding as well.
“I’m a proponent of the fountain run in general, but there’s a fine line that must be respected by both students and administrators,” said Daniel Depew, a senior majoring in astronautical engineering. “Permanent damage caused by the seniors this year obviously crosses that line, and it’s a shame to think that their actions might jeopardize a fun tradition for future classes. At the same time, I think administration — despite their dislike of the tradition — should be more open with students about how to enjoy fountain run more safely and respectfully.”
Others said that the damage was most likely the work of a few perpetrators and not representative of the spirit of the event.
“I think it is very unfortunate and distasteful that someone would be so absent minded as to harm such a notable landmark on our campus,” said Tyler Ringer, a graduating senior majoring in critical studies. “But I don’t believe it should be considered an accurate representation of the majority of seniors who seek simply to celebrate by going into the fountains.”
Huber said that FMS will be working with the Department of Public Safety and campus administration to create a plan going forward.
“The preservation of university assets is a priority for Facilities Management Services,” Huber said. “Ultimately, we plan to work with DPS and the Safety Office to follow the directives of the university’s administration.”
DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said any changes to the allowance of the annual fountain run is in the hands of the Student Affairs office.
“There’ll certainly be discussions about how to handle the situation next year,” Carlisle said. “I would think decisions about the future of the fountain run will be made by senior administrators.”
Vice Provost for Student Affairs, Dr. Ainsley Carry could not be reached for a comment at the time the Daily Trojan went to press.
The people who damaged these fountains were probably drunk.  DPS on hand to arrange transport for the inebriated could probably have prevented or minimized the  damage.
Put it on my tuition. Care.
When I was a senior completing the fountain run in 2009, there were DPS members at some of the more “delicate” fountains, including this one, to ensure that no one was climbing in areas that could hurt the fountain.  Has this changed?
