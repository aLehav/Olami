USC coach Kevin O’Neill waited almost two years to break the streak, but as the old adage goes, all streaks are made to be broken.
The Trojans (15-12, 7-7), who hadn’t beaten back-to-back road opponents since former coach Tim Floyd’s squad defeated the Oregon schools on Jan. 24 and Jan. 26 2008, took down the Stanford Cardinal 69-53 on Saturday night at Maples Pavilion, completing their two-game sweep of the Bay Area schools.
Coupled with Thursday night’s win over California 78-75, USC snapped their eight-game streak of road futility with the help of junior forward Nikola Vucevic’s double-double (19 points and 14 rebounds) and a rare burst of offensive consistency from senior Alex Stepheson, who scored 15 points on 6-of-9 shooting from the field.
For the second straight night, USC played hard for the entire 40 minutes on the defensive end, limiting Stanford (13-13, 6-9) to 33 percent shooting and 17 percent from beyond the three-point arc.
After trailing 12-8 four minutes into the first half, the Trojans went on a 22-4 run over a nine-minute span and led at halftime 40-31.
Stanford’s junior forward Josh Owens, who finished with 13 points and seven rebounds, cut the gap to seven with a quick basket to the start the second half, but a 10-0 run sparked by a Stepheson dunk and Vucevic three-point shot pushed the lead up to 17, and the Trojans never looked back.
For the second straight game, senior guard Donte Smith started in place of freshman guard Maurice Jones.
The move paid off Saturday night too, as Smith and Jones provided scoring balance for USC’s offense, scoring 13 and 10 respectively.
In a losing effort, the Cardinal were led by Owens and freshman forward Josh Huestis’ play off the bench. Huestis put in a career-high 11 points in 19 minutes of action.
The win for USC not only ended their woes away from home, but put them in a tie for fourth place in the Pac-10 standings with Oregon, while Stanford dropped to eighth in the conference.
While dreams of dancing in March are still long shots for both teams, the top six teams from the conference get a bye in the first round of next month’s conference tournament at Staples Center.
USC returns home next week to face No. 13 Arizona (23-4, 12-2) at the Galen Center.
After their thrilling 87-86 win over Washington on Saturday afternoon, the Wildcats sit alone atop the conference heading into their 7:30 p.m. contest with the Trojans on Thursday night.

When the USC men’s volleyball team learned that they would need to play Saturday night’s match without its captain senior opposite Murphy Troy, the team’s depth chart received a serious test.
The undermanned No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team (8-1, 8-1), however, refused to use Troy’s absence as an excuse for diminished play, disposing of No. 15 Pacific (6-9, 2-7) in straight sets, 25-15, 25-23, 25-21.
Troy’s replacement, redshirt freshman opposite Tanner Jensen, did not know he was inserted into the starting lineup until a half hour before the game, as Troy has been battling the stomach flu since Thursday’s match against Stanford.
But Jensen performed admirably given the circumstances, hitting seven kills at an efficient .600 clip, to go along with seven digs and three blocks.
“I wasn’t that nervous,” said Jensen. “Actually, I was more excited than anything else. I’ve been practicing for awhile now and have been waiting for my chance to play. Our team’s really deep, and it’s impressive that we can miss our best player and still come out with a win.”
Junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli and senior outside hitter Tri Bourne picked up most of the slack, doing their best Murphy Troy impersonations by combining for 25 kills.
In spite of the two veteran’s crucial contributions, USC coach Bill Ferguson made certain to commend Jensen, especially for his play in the highly-competitive third set.
“(Jensen) stepped in at the last minute and did a fantastic job,” said Ferguson. “He had two real key blocks at the end of the third set which really gave us some separation.”
At the beginning of the first set, the team’s energy was not what the home crowd was accustomed to seeing.
The Trojans got off to a sluggish start, trailing 5-2, as this new lineup struggled to communicate, especially in regards to the setting game.
At that juncture, it was fair to question how this team would recover from an emotional victory against powerhouse Stanford for a quick turnaround game.
“We came off an emotional win, in what was a big rivalry game for us, especially since a lot of us know each other,” Ciarelli said. “We weren’t as emotional [tonight] probably because we didn’t have our emotional leader in Murphy Troy. It was a different win for us, but we still swept.”
Ferguson even drew a parallel between this game and the game against Stanford in that both games tested the Trojans’ ability to rebound from a taxing previous game.
“We were a little bit crisper against Stanford,” Ferguson said. “There is no doubt about that, but I’m really proud of the way we came out tonight. It’s a testament to our team’s maturity and focus.”

Redshirt sophomore guard Stefanie Gilbreath and junior guard Briana Gilbreath did all they could to lead the USC women’s basketball team to a possible upset over No. 3 Stanford.
The two sisters combined for more than half of USC’s points, as Briana scored 17, while older sister Stefanie chipped in with 16 off the bench.
But that wasn’t enough to beat the Cardinal (23-2, 14-0), as the Women of Troy (15-9, 7-6) fell 78-64.
“I was excited to see Stefanie play really well today,” Briana said. “But this is another loss on the record that we could have won.”
In its last game against No. 3 Stanford, USC was dominated from the start, quickly falling behind and eventually losing in a rout on the road, 95-51.
But on their own home court, the Women of Troy showed why they have a good chance to play in the NCAA tournament in March.
“We had our chance to get back in [the game] … we’re developing toughness,” said USC coach Micahel Cooper. “I think we’re definitely getting better … [we’re] learning what it takes to play the top-echelon teams.”
The beginning of the game was closely contested, and at one point, USC held a six-point lead over Stanford.
But midway through the first half, Stanford went on an 8-0 run to take a 19-16 lead over the Women of Troy.
The Cardinal proceeded to extend their lead to 31-22, and for a few minutes it looked as though they would pull away from USC.
But the Women of Troy outplayed their foes from Palo Alto for the rest of the first half, converting four of their five shots from three-point range to cut the deficit to 38-36 going into halftime.
Stanford leads the conference in field-goal percentage defense, as their opponents make only 32.9 percent of their shots. But USC bettered that mark in the first half, converting 48.4 percent of its shots.
Briana helped the Women of Troy off to their fast start by scoring 11 of their first 16 points, while Stefanie made the most of her five minutes on the court by making all three of her shots for a total of eight points.
The Women of Troy made five out of their nine attempts from three-point range in the first half, despite missing junior guard Ashley Corral from the starting lineup.
Corral, who recently became USC’s all-time leader in career three-pointers, suffered an ankle injury in practice this week and played only 12 minutes.
But the Cardinal also had to play through a key injury when junior forward and leading scorer Nnemkadi Ogwumike fell awkwardly on her right ankle near the beginning of the second half.
Ogwumike hobbled into the visitors’ locker room shortly after, and didn’t play for the rest of the game.
“[Ogwumike] is a major part of everything Stanford does, offense and defense,” Briana said. With somebody like that out of the game, we think ‘Okay, maybe we can start chipping off the lead a little bit.'”
But by that time, the Cardinal had already built a 50-38 lead after they seemed to finally find the shooting stroke that has carried them to an undefeated record through the Pac-10 thus far.
“I think [the key to the game] was the first five minutes in the second half,” Briana said. “[Stanford] came out and they buckled down. They got more physical … we just kind of ran out of gas.”
USC did mount a 9-2 run after Ogwumike exited to get back into the game, but Stanford responded a few minutes later with a 12-2 run of its own.
That streak gave the Cardinal their biggest lead of the game at 66-51.
The two teams essentially traded baskets for the rest of the game, and the Women of Troy never got another scoring run together in an attempt to give Stanford its first loss in conference play.
Seniors Jeanette Pohlen and Kayla Pedersen, who scored 19 and 17 points, respectively, led the Cardinal.
The Women of Troy play at home against California on Sunday at 2 p.m., in a crucial battle that will help determine who finishes third in the Pac-10.
USC and Arizona State are currently tied for third place, but Cal, Arizona and Washington State are all within a game and a half.
