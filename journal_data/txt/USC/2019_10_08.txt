Growing up, my grandfather taught me simple Taekwondo techniques. From closed-hand strikes to open-hand techniques, I remember how he instructed my cousins and me how to block and punch correctly.
Considering my grandfather was an eighth-degree black belt, it made sense that he knew all this. As a matter of fact, he moved to the United States when my mother was 9 years old to establish a Taekwondo business in Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, the business did not do as well as he had hoped. But despite his hardships, martial arts remained an integral part of my family’s identity.
Growing up, I barely participated in martial arts myself, but I remember attending my younger brother’s Taekwondo competitions and practices, wondering exactly how his developing skills would actually help him if he were to get into a physical fight.
I occasionally experienced different types of martial arts as well — mostly on televised world competitions such as the Summer Olympics, which include boxing, judo, Taekwondo and wrestling. Nonetheless, these were the only times I ever got exposure to these sports.
I can’t recall a single time that I’ve watched a karate competition on ESPN, and I never bothered to attend my high school’s wrestling matches. Maybe it was because I never understood the enjoyment of watching people perform the same routine over and over again, but it was also the fact that I was just not interested. This makes me wonder just how prominent martial arts — karate, Taekwondo, judo, etc. — are in the United States.
The one highly viewed sport that consists of two people physically fighting each other is World Wrestling Entertainment. The WWE has been gaining popularity since Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson announced his return to WWE: Smackdown in September. 
Even though most WWE events are pay-per-view, the sport still brings in millions of viewers. In The Rock’s return to the ring last Friday, just under 4 million people tuned into the event on Fox Premiere. 
I personally don’t even consider the WWE a real martial art. Most of the time, the WWE consists of well-trained actors who fight each other for pure entertainment. There is no skill involved, yet WWE fighters are among the wealthiest athletes in the nation.
As for the traditional martial arts, the number of participants around the nation has been dwindling. According to statista.com, 6.87 million people participated in martial arts in 2006 compared to just 3.42 million in 2017. The fact that the number of participants in martial arts has decreased by half is a clear sign that the sport is losing popularity.
Compared to the 3.42 million people who participated in martial arts, 5.22 million played tackle football in 2017. This is shocking because martial arts seem like they should be much easier to join than football; martial arts programs are widely available, and fewer parents are willing to allow their children to play tackle football.
The question for many families is, “Are martial arts even worth it?” The average price of karate is $40 per hour and may go as high as $100 for 30-minute private lessons. Martial arts training is not the cheapest, but many parents send their children to martial arts dojos with the hope that martial arts will prepare their children if they need to defend themselves.
There are many benefits to martial arts. They allow a person to gain confidence, a sense of responsibility and values including respect, honor and integrity. 
Nonetheless, there are doubts as to the actual self-defense value of martial arts. According to functionalselfdefense.org, “Many [martial arts programs] were not made for self defense in the first place, most provide no education in or understanding of real violence or how to prevent it and a very large number of them utilize training methods that do not and cannot lead to real skills.”
Most martial arts are not so much about the actual “fighting” component but instead focus on bolstering confidence and diligence. It could be said that parents invest the $40 each month partially to teach them self-defense, but mainly to teach them valuable life lessons. 
Furthermore, there are no martial arts varsity teams at USC or in the Pac-12. As a result, there is not a martial arts team on the same level as, say, football and basketball. There are club teams that participate in martial arts, but even then not many people know of their existence.
Martial arts are a great activity for children to get involved in at a young age. They help a person become more physically fit while instilling important values that last beyond one’s time in the sport. Though the programs’ costs may be daunting, martial arts should be embraced and utilized in every way.

No. 5 USC men’s water polo earned two more tough wins over the weekend, defeating No. 13 UC Irvine 16-10 at home Saturday before narrowly beating No. 4 UC Santa Barbara 10-9 on the road Sunday.
The Trojans now sit at 9-2, holding a four-game win streak and remaining undefeated at home this season.
Saturday’s game against UC Irvine was a dominant showing by the Trojans on both ends of the pool. USC put up 8 goals in the first half to just 1 from UCI. The Trojans would not relinquish the commanding lead in the second half, despite a fourth-quarter surge from UCI that saw the Anteaters put six shots in the back of the net. However, the Anteaters never came within striking distance of the Trojans, who captured the 16-10 victory.
The USC offense fired on all cylinders against Irvine. Junior driver Jacob Mercep led the team with 4 goals while nine different Trojans scored at least once in the contest. The defense was bolstered by junior goalie Vaios Vlahotasios, who recorded a career-best 15 saves.
Vlahotasios’ fellow goalie, sophomore Nic Porter, complimented his teammate’s play after Saturday’s game.
“It’s a testament, really, to the way he trains and his attitude,” Porter said. “He’s a great training partner, and together we make a really great goalie team … I can’t speak highly enough of him and his performance.”	
Sunday’s game in Santa Barbara was a much more evenly matched affair than Saturday’s. The Trojans jumped out to a 4-2 lead in the first period but surrendered that advantage after 3 consecutive goals by the Gauchos to begin the second frame. USC equalized before the end of the half, however, and the two teams went into the third tied at 5 goals apiece.
The third quarter saw a series of lead changes as USC went down a goal, scored 2 straight goals to take the lead, gave up another 2 to UCSB and finally tied the score at 8 as the third period came to a close. 
In the first minute of the final period, the Trojans once again jumped out to a 1-goal lead, but Santa Barbara quickly answered back with a goal of its own. Then, with under seven minutes remaining in the game, sophomore two-meter Jake Ehrhardt put away USC’s 10th and final goal. After Porter blocked a last-minute shot attempt by UCSB junior attacker Cole Brosnan, the Trojans played keep-away to run out the clock en route to a 10-9 victory.
USC has only lost twice this season, with one of those losses coming at the hands of Santa Barbara in mid-September. The team kept the frustration of that defeat in mind heading into Sunday’s contest.
“We were pretty disappointed to pick up our first loss of the season to them, so that was definitely a motivating factor for us,” Porter said. “Full credit to them. It was their home pool, they came with a lot of energy and played a great game … but I guess we wanted it more in the end, and that’s why we got the result.”
The team is on a roll and feeling optimistic about its future, but it remains focused on improving various aspects of its game moving forward, particularly defense.
“It feels great to finish [the weekend] with two wins … That’s really going to give us a lot of confidence heading into the rest of the season and the postseason,” Porter said. “[But] we can always improve on our defense. That’s our team philosophy … It’s something that can never be perfect, so we’ll try to get to as close to that as we can.”
The Trojans will have the chance to avenge their only other loss of the season as they take on Pacific Oct. 12 in Stockton, Calif.

The 2019 season has been a whirlwind for USC football. Numerous distractions have prevented the team from just lining up and playing football, as rumors about head coach Clay Helton’s job security have continued to swirl despite a few impressive victories by the Trojans. 
Helton remains focused on the task at hand as he gears up to take on No. 9 Notre Dame Saturday in South Bend, Ind. 
“I’m just focused on the 110 men out there,” Helton said after practice Tuesday. “When you think about them as your children, your sons, you concentrate your full attention on them.” 
Injuries to quarterbacks sophomore JT Daniels and freshman Kedon Slovis forced the squad to play third-string redshirt junior quarterback Matt Fink, who was in the transfer portal at one point this summer.
The whole team has been banged up, playing without captain senior linebacker Jordan Iosefa and adjusting to short term injuries plaguing sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga, sophomore cornerback Olaijah Griffin, redshirt senior defensive lineman Christian Rector and redshirt freshman cornerback Isaac Taylor-Stuart — all key contributors — among others. 
Helton announced after practice Tuesday that Slovis will be starting against the Irish and that Hufanga and Griffin are expected to play after missing the last contest against Washington.
Ready for the task
The Trojans face the biggest challenge they’ve had all season when they hit the road to take on Notre Dame — whose one loss came by a single score against an immensely talented Georgia team on the road.
Helton said he is fired up about the test his team will face this weekend. With aspirations of winning the Pac-12 South and reaching another Rose Bowl, a win would go a long way to strengthen its season resume. 
“The opportunity to go to South Bend and play Notre Dame and to be a part of this historic rivalry is special to us as coaches, as players and as a University,” Helton said. 
Notre Dame Stadium is sure to be a raucous environment. Pair that with the sub-45-degree forecasts and Notre Dame’s two-game win streak in the series, and the Trojans are heavy underdogs coming into the matchup.
Nearing full strength
However, the Trojans could not be more ready to make the trip to the Midwest and take the Jeweled Shillelagh back. 
Slovis is back under center after suffering a concussion early in the game against Utah, and no stage is bigger than this one for the young freshman. After a shaky performance against BYU, Slovis never got a chance to redeem himself due to the injury. Now, he’s focusing on clearing his mind and resetting for the upcoming game. 
“[I’m] just being disciplined and not letting the previous play affect me,” Slovis said. “If I make a mistake, [I’ve] got to come back and not do the same thing the next play.”
The bye week gave him the opportunity he needed to get back to practicing and preparing for the start. 
“I think the biggest thing is just getting my legs back,” Slovis said. “At quarterback, it seems pretty easy — you’re just taking a three-step drop — but I think a big part of it is getting your feet in position to throw. When you’re not practicing for a week, I think you lose that a bit.”
Although he hasn’t seen game action in the last couple of weeks, Slovis said that his timing with his receivers and his confidence in the playmakers around him have not changed. 
Along with Slovis’ return, Helton said the team will benefit from the timing of the bye week. 
“After playing two physical games against Utah and Washington, and then another physical game at Notre Dame, I couldn’t imagine a better time,” Helton said. “I’m glad it’s not after this game. We needed it.”
Reversing history
The last time the Trojans played in South Bend, things got out of hand quickly, and Notre Dame cruised to a 49-14 victory. Senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. said he remembers that game and wants to prevent the same thing from happening again. The Trojans have struggled on the road this year, so a win this week would be pivotal in changing that narrative. 
“The refs combined with the crowd energy — things just get rolling against us and it’s just hard to break that cycle,” Pittman said. “As long as we play clean football, I think that we’ll be good … We have a good plan.”
The success of Pittman and fellow wide receivers sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown and redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns will be pivotal. The trio combined for 305 yards receiving and a touchdown in USC’s matchup with Notre Dame last season.
Irish head coach Brian Kelly called it “the best wide receiver corps [Notre Dame] will see all year.” Going up against a thin secondary, this will be the position to watch come Saturday.
Last season, the Trojans came up one score short of ruining the Irish’s chances of making the College Football Playoff. A win this week could do just the same for the Irish — and catapult USC into the second half of its season.

As the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere increases, natural disasters are becoming more frequent and devastating year after year. The USC community should unite and use its unique resources to help natural disaster victims
This year’s Atlantic hurricane season, which is currently ongoing, started earlier than the official start for the fifth consecutive year.
Hurricane Dorian, a Category 5 tropical cyclone that hit the Bahamas Sept. 1, claimed the lives of 61 people. On Sept. 26, the National Emergency Management Agency last stated that  608 people were still missing, which could significantly raise the death toll. 
The most USC has done to respond to a natural disaster was to issue an official statement expressing sympathy to those affected by Hurricane Harvey and reminding students, faculty and staff of USC’s various counseling services and psychological support systems. 
Besides individual donations or volunteer trips to disaster-afflicted areas from students or faculty, the University has not taken any action other than counseling services to aid victims of natural disasters.
When hurricanes claim dozens of lives and wipe out people’s homes and cities, the University can use its power to affect tangible change for those affected by the natural disaster. 
As for ways the University recommended the community help in past natural disasters, it asked those who want to help to donate to a relief agency of their choice. In the future, instead of leaving it up to students to find ways to get involved, USC should take full advantage of its prestige and power by partnering with nonprofit organizations involved in disaster relief such as UNICEF or the American Red Cross.
USC should then help these nongovernmental organizations get what they need by forwarding on calls for financial and/or material donations, equipment lending or volunteers to the USC community. When it comes to donations, USC prides itself on having an extensive alumni network all around the world.  But why hasn’t the University called for the alumni network, which is more than 375,000 strong, to help the affected communities?
The school’s potential volunteer pool is also incredible. USC is home to some of the most talented, energetic and purposeful students on the planet.
USC has already taken similar initiatives for past natural disasters. Through its Volunteer Center, dozens of students have gone on alternative breaks domestically and internationally to explore issues such as immigration, poverty, homelessness, education, environmental preservation and even disaster relief efforts. 
Over the 2017 winter break, the center coordinated a trip that took 13 USC students to Texas, where they helped rebuild homes after the hurricane. This trip proves that it is realistic for the University to be involved on a greater scale than simply its local community. 
As L.A.’s largest private employer, USC also has a hard-working and admirable staff and faculty whose expertise in fields such as medicine, geology, environmental health and law could prove useful to victims and first responders. 
The University could encourage supplies donations by allowing donation bins to be placed around campus. By finally coordinating its unique resources to contribute to relief efforts, the school could reaffirm its commitment to public service and fulfill its “role in the development of the nation and the world.”
As members of the USC community, we are far more resourceful than we imagine, and it is our responsibility to do everything in our power to help those who have lost it all to recover from national disasters. 
Although most of us end up moving on after the initial shock, survivors are in desperate need of food and water for weeks. 
We can no longer ignore our power to help those affected by natural disasters, especially as we prepare ourselves to live in a world where those disasters will have an unprecedented impact on our lives. We can all do much more than we think.

USC’s Thematic Option program, an alternative, honors approach to USC’s general education requirements, promotes interdisciplinary thought within a smaller community of students. It values small class sizes and varied student and professor perspectives, aiming to provide students with an experience similar to that of a liberal arts college. 
Although all students are welcome to apply, the requirements of the program make it difficult for students with already rigid and demanding course plans — especially those in STEM or on the pre-health emphasis — to fit the core classes into their schedules. 
Difficulty in scheduling or pressure caused by policies such as not allowing classes to be taken pass/fail disproportionately deters these students. The program should reconsider its requirements and structure to better accommodate a broader range of students and therefore better the enriching community that the program is geared toward cultivating.
The Thematic Option curriculum consists of six core courses. Additionally, there are four regular general education categories that students must fulfill, which brings the requirements to a total of 12 courses. The general education and writing requirements also require 12 courses; however, they allow more flexibility in scheduling as well as a wider range of classes.  
Although both options require the same number of courses, it doesn’t always work out that way since most majors include some regular general education classes in the major requirements. So, in reality, participating in Thematic Option is often “doubling up” on some general education areas. 
For students in engineering or students on the pre-health emphasis — who may have more than 80 units of major requirements, including lab courses — a matter of two to three courses is important. 
The Thematic Option website demonstrates how its classes pull from many subject areas, stating that one of its first-semester freshman courses may integrate classics, history, philosophy, politics and biology while analyzing the themes of the course. For the program to fulfill this claim to its fullest, students from all of these backgrounds should be participating equally. 
While STEM majors may be less interested in a humanities- and writing-based program than humanities majors in the first place, this imbalance of interest is exactly why the program should be made more feasible for and accessible to  STEM students. This would  create an optimal community bouncing ideas between people from very different academic backgrounds. 
Since the growth of science and technology has caused many people to devalue the humanities, the University should help combat this growing gap by making the program more appealing to a larger number of STEM majors.
There is no simple solution that could make Thematic Option more welcoming for all students. However, the University could consider allowing classes to be taken on a pass/no pass basis, reducing the number of long lab sections, re-evaluating the core categories and introducing 2-unit courses that could count towards the core requirements. 
All of these changes can be made without sacrificing the rigor of the program.
Thematic Option is not for everyone — and it shouldn’t be. However, all students should have the chance to participate and stay in the program both for their personal development and to enrich the Thematic Option community as a whole. 
A more prominent and diverse Thematic Option program could make USC stand out among large research universities as a school that provides the opportunity for all types of students to have a liberal arts experience.

Under the sweltering heat radiating from a relentless sun on the city’s concrete floor, I wipe the sweat that’s gathered under my lips and remind myself that it is, indeed, fall.
Despite the warm weather, it’s fall. A slow, lagging fall, dragging its feet in the light of a powerful sun, but fall nonetheless. Sometimes, when a thin layer of clouds wraps over Southern California for more than a couple early morning hours, it really feels like fall. 
In Los Angeles, autumn is subtle. Catch the chilly breeze whipping around sunkissed hair, the colder nights that require a sweater or — god forbid — a jacket, the smell of clean air as the blanket of smog lifts. In many ways, Southern California fall is less of a weather pattern and more of an energy, one leaning into darker nights, softer clothes and warmer foods. 
For many, the first indicator of fall is the pumpkin spice latte’s triumphant return to the Starbucks menu, blessing the color scheme with orange hues, exciting a nation for the sweet, comforting spices of colder seasons. 
For others, the first indicator of fall is the incomprehensible feeling of rage towards the pumpkin spice latte. You like pumpkin spice lattes? I don’t. I hate the taste. Pumpkin spice lattes are basic. Pumpkin spice lattes are stupid. Pumpkin spice lattes are for basic, unintelligent girls. 
The inevitable annual anger toward pumpkin spice and other fall-flavored foods is a phenomenon that divides a nation, led by dissenters invested in separating themselves from the stereotypes they observe and perpetuate surrounding pumpkin spice, particularly that women are the primary consumers of fall products. 
Products that have a large female audience are often hyper-criticized, ridiculed and lampooned. The return of pumpkin spice usually indicates the return of pumpkin spice jokes on social media. The jokes about girls and pumpkin spice fit under a larger umbrella of jokes about girls and fall weather, girls and fall clothing, girls and fall foods.
Maybe this is my bias as a girl, but sometimes it feels as if the jokes are not an attempt to make fun of an annual trend, but instead function as a vehicle to hate a general behavior of women. 
For some men, pumpkin spice appears as yet another vapid interest of young girls, something they are too intelligent and defined to enjoy. For some women, hating pumpkin spice is an easy way to achieve individuality from the masses, a unique perspective. For others, pumpkin spice feels like soulless corporate bait, and those who succumb to it are stupid. 
There are a lot of easy ways to hate either the fans of pumpkin spice or pumpkin spice itself, but it’s hard to comprehend why this season and its flavors are so divisive. Surely, there must be more satisfying ways to claim superiority over others. It feels like a waste of energy to dislike a flavor just because others love it, and it feels like an attempt to humiliate others, especially girls, for enjoying it. 
Yes, pumpkin spice season is upon us. Yes, it is overwhelming to step into Starbucks or Trader Joe’s and see the annual overload of cinnamon and ginger, sweet pumpkin and spiced apple. Maybe it could be seen as a corporate exploitation of our yearning for fall. Or, maybe, it is an aspect of fall that people truly look forward to.
In Southern California, there are few ways to celebrate fall. There are no changing leaves, no rainstorms, no frostbitten nights. Instead, we have to rely on the foods that comfort us, and I can’t think of a better way to enjoy the season. 
So if the hateful gurglings against pumpkin spice begin to rise, try, perhaps, to let the basic white girls have this one.

Arthur Fleck twirls, twirls and twirls a sign, enclothed in full clown attire — he dances and smiles without a worry in the world. Everyone walks by him, creeped out more than anything. 
But that doesn’t matter to Fleck, who is enjoying himself as he forgets how he’s perceived by the world. When a group of teenagers steals his sign, Fleck jolts back into  reality. As he sprints to retrieve it, Fleck is hit by the sign, which ruptures in pieces. He lies on the floor as the teenagers laugh at the expense of his pain. He’s broken. Broken by society.
Todd Phillips’ “Joker” is a chilling character study of the most iconic supervillain in comic book lore. The movie explores how a man who has dealt with mental health issues, physical abuse and psychological torment at the hands of society can descend into an irreversible path of violence.
Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix, has been released from a psychiatric hospital. Loads of medication and mandatory sessions with an uninterested social worker keep him away from losing all sense of himself — that is, until the program is cut. He now lives with his mother Penny (Frances Conroy), who seems to only want to talk about Gotham billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). He idolizes late-night talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert de Niro) and hopes to one day become a stand-up comedian.
When word gets around that Fleck was assaulted by a group of teenagers, one of his coworkers gives him a gun under the assumption that he’ll use it when in danger. This is the beginning of Fleck’s descent into madness, one that will cause him to lash out against those who have wronged him. 
Lawrence Sher’s gritty cinematography captures Gotham City as a desolate place, with graffiti-laden streets, rundown infrastructure and pollution ravaging the city. Capturing Gotham disparagingly highlights how hope has been lost not just by Fleck but also by the city’s residents, who are on the brink of rioting to make their voices heard. The setting captures the same mood as in Martin Scorcese’s “Taxi Driver,” a major inspiration for Phillips. Fleck strikes a clear parallel to Travis Bickle: Both men have been deemed outsiders of society, and lashing out is their only perceived way to retaliate — and to ensure that the world listens.
Plenty of controversy surrounded the film prior to its release. Worries about glorifying violence or sympathizing with Fleck have raised questions. But just like “Taxi Driver,” “Joker” is a cautionary tale of what happens when society fails people. 
Phoenix is at his very best in this role, toeing the line between sympathy and utter fear. His mannerisms and maniacal laugh, a medical condition, make it clear that Fleck is a troubled man. Audiences can sympathize with the trauma that he has endured, but viewers are repulsed by him moments later when he lashes out. Although there are many differences between Phoenix’s portrayal and Heath Ledger’s, Phoenix is sure to be an Oscar favorite for this role.
What makes this film such a disturbing experience is the bombastic score from Hildur Guðnadóttir, whose use of the cello generates an eerie tone that resembles Fleck’s jagged mindset. Some of the song choices used in the film are a bit too on the nose, but they are used effectively.
The film builds up, slowly leading to the inevitable turn from Fleck to the Joker and culminating in a third act filled with surprises and bloodshed as the clown completely turns on society. Expect to be confounded. 
“Joker” reinvents the proliferated comic book genre that has been tied down to cinematic universes, Thanos-level threats and post-credit stingers for a personal character study that explains the origins of a man who turns to violence. This film isn’t a glorification of men like Fleck who revel in chaos but is focused on the question: What level of accountability do we hold, or should we hold, for neglecting people who are already isolated and suffer from mental health issues?

By now, every student is well-acquainted with the layout of a typical lecture hall, with its sweeping rows, intimidating lectern and podium and awkwardly narrow aisleways. 
Lecture halls may be ubiquitous at USC and at any other college campus, but a large body of research, including a study conducted by professors at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has found that their layout and structure are not optimal for student learning. This research suggests that an overhaul in not just classroom design but also lecture styles may be necessary to improve student learning.
One shortcoming of a lecture hall’s cascading seating is that students can see the screens of everyone sitting in front of them. This may mean that even if you’re on task and diligently taking notes, pictures, videos and notifications popping up left and right on the screens in front of you can be really distracting. This is especially an issue for people with neurological disorders that impair attention, such as attention-deficit disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
As humans, we already have limited attentional capacity, according to cognitive neuroscientists. Donald Broadbent, an early psychologist, described attention filtering as a bottleneck in which we receive large quantities of information in the body of the bottle, but only a fraction of that information makes it through the bottleneck to be attended to. 
For people with attention deficits, this limited attention is exacerbated; brain scans have shown that people with ADHD have a smaller frontal lobe, the part of the brain responsible for attention. Because of this, their attentional capacity is even further reduced. Additional research on selective attention has shown that as the brain filters through environmental stimuli, objects that are colorful and in motion are more likely to attract attention. This means that your peers’ laptop screens are highly salient to your brain’s attentional processing system, making it an easy distraction.
In its publication titled “The Neuroscience of Classrooms,” furniture design firm Spaceoasis recommends designating a separate digital space, which entails all the computers concentrated in one part of the classroom. This could be applied to lecture halls by separating students using laptops and students taking handwritten notes into different parts of the room to help minimize digital distractions.
Another significant barrier to learning in lecture halls is the rigidity of the classroom setup. The majority of research surrounding classroom design recommends using movable furniture instead of fixed furniture pieces along with plenty of open floor space that can be adapted to different kinds of class activities — large-group work, small-group work and individual work. These literature findings contrast starkly with a typical lecture hall, which comprises seats anchored in rigid rows and a whiteboard pinned to the front of the room. 
USC has taken a step in the right direction by furnishing smaller classrooms with mobile desks and chairs. However, these classrooms are often so cramped that it is difficult to actually rearrange the furniture, and their small size makes way for little open floor space. 
Finally, another disadvantage of lecture halls is that it is more difficult for the professor to engage with students. Education research has shown that more student-faculty interaction is associated with student success. 
Faculty tends to agree with this notion — in a study that surveyed professors at the UNC, the majority of faculty members identified the ability to walk around and engage with students as a priority in choosing classrooms. The narrow rows of lecture halls make it almost impossible for professors to reach every student in the class, hence limiting one-on-one interactions.
However, it is also important to consider that interacting personally with students in large, lecture-style classes is not feasible given time and resource constraints. Similarly, lecture halls may not have adaptable furniture because typical lecture styles do not lend themselves to group or individual work time. 
Poor classroom design is only a symptom of the greater problem: teaching style. If students benefit from faculty engagement and small-group activities, then lecture-style classes are counterproductive. 
While it may be impractical to reduce class sizes and to implement a more engaging teaching style in large classes, a study by educators shows that there are ways to incorporate instructional methods that encourage active learning into class sizes of 50 to several hundred students that have proven results. Lecturers can use a method developed by Harvard professor Eric Mazur known as peer instruction, in which professors pose a question to the class, followed by individual thinking and group discussion time. This type of active learning instruction creates a need for classrooms that allow instructors to engage with students in different areas and provide flexible guidelines for different types of learning activities.
To remedy the issue of poor classroom design, we must first tackle the issue of rigid teaching styles and large class sizes so that we have course plans that allow for more flexible classroom setups and aid students’ learning.

Fernando Lebrija, USC alumnus and renowned director of “Amar a Morir,” is unafraid of breaking barriers. 
His breadth of work in the film industry is evidenced by his roles as a director, producer, writer and director of photography, as well as his filmography from music videos to feature-length film projects. His work was something he was proud to share when he attended the 2019 Latino Media Fest held Oct. 2 to 4 in Century City. 
“Right now, I think the Latino voice — storywise, director-wise, acting-wise — needs to be heard a little bit stronger in the U.S., and that’s what I’m doing in the Latino Fest,” said Lebrija, a member of the National Association of Latino Independent Producers. “I’m going to support my fellow Latino filmmakers to start standing up to Hollywood, to put more pressure to let us have more jobs and tell more stories that we relate to.”
For Lebrija, representation is important. His whose goal is to paint stories of the Latinx community that do not rely on detrimental stereotypes previously constructed and perpetuated by Hollywood. 
“I always put a stamp on the films with a Latino flavor, meaning I either cast Latino actors for some roles or I use some of the most important traditions of Latino [people],” Lebrija said. “[I want to] show Latino people without the stereotype. They can be normal businessmen or lawyers — they are not just gardeners or valets or cooks.”
Yet, Lebrija said he believes there is an important distinction to be made. While he does believe in showcasing a greater voice to Latinx stories on screen, he also said there is a typecast where Latinx directors are not seen as capable of handling films outside of their ethnic community. 
“It’s not about like, ‘OK, you’re Latino, you can just do Latino stories,’” Lebrija said. “No, that is a mistake. We are filmmakers, and we can tell any story, any genre, any ethnicity. We are just trying to get the opportunity to let us shine and let us show them that we can be also Martin Scorsece, we can be Steven Spielbergs here and not just the ‘Three Amigos.’”
Lebrija’s current advocacy, through events like the Media Fest, exhibits a passion for change, and his journey from an immigrant film student to acclaimed director speaks to his influence on aspiring Latinx filmmakers.  
Lebrija first entered the industry in Mexico as a director for music videos and commercials. While these endeavors largely contrast his current work, he cites them as two great steps in his developmental path.
“Music videos help because they are like little short films and you have all the creative liberty,” Lebrija said. “What really helped me in commercials was to understand the professional side of the business, meaning dealing with executives that don’t know anything about film, being patient, being a good collaborator and being very diplomatic.”
Although the surrounding environment did provide Lebrija with essential knowledge, he said, did not fully satiate his desire for a well-rounded film education.
“I came from a world in Mexico where there are not real producers — there are a lot of great directors, great DPs, great art directors — we have a lot of awesome creative people, but we did not have good producers because there was not an education to make good producers,” Lebrija said.
Consequently, Lebrija took the risk to emigrate to the United States from Mexico and attended three programs at AFI, USC and UCLA for a master’s in producing, postgraduate in screenwriting and practicum in directing, respectively. Lebrija is still fearless when following uncertainty and challenges in the film industry.
“I like to take risks. I like to go against the norm,” Lebrija said. “When I did my first movie, it was a thriller-romantic drama, with some action. And then I moved to do a crazy, teenage raunchy comedy. People were saying, ‘Are you crazy? You need to stay in the same genre and show people what you do best.’ I’m like, well, I like challenges, and I don’t want people to take me as a drama director only. I want to be a little bit more eclectic.”
As he continues to navigate his career and stretch his creative abilities, Lebrija hopes to provide insight from his own journey to young filmmakers who are searching for their voices.
“To any filmmaker or Latino filmmaker out there, just don’t stop believing,” Lebrija said. “I know it’s a tough road, and it’s a bumpy road. Even me, I feel like I’m in the middle of that road, I’m not even there yet. Like I said before, my time is just starting now. I just want to tell people that if they have the dream to keep pursuing, don’t stop. Be fearless and take any challenge.”
