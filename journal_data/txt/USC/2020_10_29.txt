Many see the 2020 election as a referendum on President Donald Trump and his presidency. This is a fair assessment considering how controversial and divisive of a president he has been. Opponents see Trump as a failed leader with poor character and a threat to democracy, while his base remains fiercely loyal to him.
Aside from the lack of respect and dignity in the Oval Office over the past four years, there have been numerous detrimental, regressive policies implemented. The president pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change and instituted a Muslim ban, and is rolling back climate regulations, attempting to repeal the Affordable Care Act (which provides health care coverage for tens of millions of Americans), separating families at the U.S-Mexican border and failing to lead an adequate response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Early voting and mail-in voting numbers are at their highest rates of all time, and the electorate is highly motivated on both sides of the coin. The votes cast for former Vice President Joe Biden are largely seen as votes against Trump. However, they should also be seen as votes for Biden’s America.
It is clear that Biden is ready to both bring the country together and create positive, progressive change for the United States. He has a history of bipartisan leadership in the Senate, which may help calm political tensions, and a steady and caring temperament that can unite the country.
Biden will also bring some of the most progressive policies our country has seen to the table. This includes tackling the climate crisis the clock is ticking on, according to scientists. Biden said he will propose a $2 trillion investment in clean energy, re-enter the Paris Agreement and strengthen the environmental regulations that Trump has rolled back.
Biden has also said he will work to close the ever widening wealth gap in the U.S. Additionally, he said he will expand housing vouchers for low-income families, triple federal spending for low-income school districts and make public universities free for students from all families earning less than $125,000 per year. These policies, which can be paid for by ensuring large corporations pay their fair share, will help begin to reverse the economic oppression marginalized groups have faced throughout this country’s existence.
Biden has also said he will follow through on multiple issues Trump wanted to address but did not have the leadership or strategy to do so. One of these is a $1.3 trillion infrastructure plan to improve roads, bridges, highways, airports and railroads. This investment will create millions of jobs. Trump has also claimed he would “fix” health care for the past four years. A Biden presidency will expand the Affordable Care Act to ensure more Americans get the health care they need and create a public option to reduce costs and hold insurance companies accountable.
There may be skepticism about Biden’s ability to accomplish some of these ambitious policy goals, possibly because he has been in the political world for so long or due to his age and reputation as a centrist. However, these reasons may be exactly why the Biden presidency has the potential to be so impactful.
His past relationships with current congressional leaders and his reputation as a moderate give him a better chance to pass progressive policies and ensure the country is comfortable with them. Furthermore, Biden’s age suggests that he will voluntarily be a one-term president. This gives him the freedom to pursue policies he feels are beneficial and not worry about potential political fallout that would affect his re-election.
This election is certainly an evaluation of Trump, but those rebuking him in the polls should also be looking forward to the potential for Biden’s presidency. It will be a vast contrast from Trump’s and will move the country forward.

An NBA Finals win, a week until a long-anticipated presidential election, a World Series win and final exams looming ominously in the near future — each of these can consume your thoughts on their own, so how am I supposed to deal with them all at once?
The fall semester began 73 days ago. We were sent home from campus last spring 231 days ago, and we have survived a total of 303 days of 2020 so far. Attempting to describe every major event of this bizarre year would be an almost impossible task, and we still have an inevitable uptick on Nov. 3, which is less than a week away.
Because of the mental strain caused by this year, 2020 has seemed to last ages. As we approach November, I am extremely tired for many reasons. With the recent championship wins by two Los Angeles teams, it seems when good news comes, it can easily be drowned out by consuming negativity.
Zoom University is clearly not a sustainable mode of learning. This week alone, I have several papers and projects to work on and virtually submit to teachers who I have not and most likely will never meet in person. Most students spend the day learning in the same spot, staring at the same screen, followed by homework on that exact same screen. 
All this may seem very pessimistic as it’s pretty clear that I am frustrated. I believe that all this pent up frustration and negative energy is really from the absence of my own sport in my daily life. This is legitimately the longest I have gone without organized sports in over a decade, and I am really feeling the effects of not having an outlet to release excess energy every day.
In high school, and now college, sports have been a way to cope with the stress of everyday life. This year in USC men’s volleyball, we often refer to the practice courts as a sanctuary. Every day of the week, we leave our phones in our lockers and forget about the school work we have for four cathartic hours. As you walk up the stairs in Galen Center, everyone mentally “locks in.”
Having several hours each day away from social media was already a worthwhile benefit to attending practice. Shifting focus to a sport itself, pushing yourself to be better and enjoying the camaraderie of your teammates on a daily basis is something that I took for granted. It provided me with a healthy coping mechanism for the stress of everyday life. Now without it, I am only left wanting that same camaraderie more than ever.
To be fair, I have been able to pursue another love in basketball as I have used that as a backup outlet for my restlessness and need to compete. Carving out an hour or two per day to play pick-up three-on-three basketball has been a daily highlight since the semester started in August. However, it still cannot compare to the daily training of volleyball.
Not only does volleyball give me an opportunity to leave the world behind, but it also is a journey with a clear goal and with rewards along the way, something that has been absent this school year. Almost every day leaving the gym, I can confidently say I improved as an individual which added to the strength of the team as a whole. During Zoom lectures, I often finish class wondering how much I really received from that hour or two of lecture. 
I am constantly asking myself: Did I really learn, or am I really just telling myself that I did?
After a session in the weight room, my body might be aching, but it only reassures my mind that I used my time to better myself. After a virtual lecture, I don’t receive that gratification, instead just added frustration on top of what is already presented by news and social media.
This is all very evident to me as I am currently living in a city of champions here in L.A. Winning the NBA Finals and the MLB World Series within weeks of each other should be a memorable moment for the city and its people. Every Angeleno should feel a sense of pride in their city and their hometown sports teams. However, because of the state of the year and current events, that sense of reward just feels lackluster compared to what it has the potential to be.
Hopefully, moving forward, collegiate sports and other activities among USC students will return in an exciting yet safe manner. Until then, I can only look for other outlets to escape the stress of the day, such as locking myself in a gym with only a goal of improvement.

This online video-streaming platform, free to students, provides a wide selection of horror and thrillers that will make this Halloween just as scary as the ones before.

“The Little Shop of Horrors”
Both horrific and comical, this 1960 film tells the story of a clumsy florist shop assistant, Seymour Krelborn (Jonathan Haze), and his unexpected discovery of a strange plant that he names “Audrey Jr.” The plant has the ability to speak and feed on humans. Audrey Jr.’s uniqueness attracts many customers to the shop and greatly pleases the shop owner. Intending to keep his job at the shop, Seymour has to find a food source for Audrey Jr. even if it means sacrificing someone else’s life. The film turned out to be successful and inspired the plot of an off-Broadway musical and later a Broadway revival in 2003.
“House on Haunted Hill”
In this supernatural thriller, five people are invited by a mysterious millionaire, Frederick Loren (Vincent Price), to a “haunted house” party at a spooky house on Haunted Hill. These people come from all walks of life and do not know each other nor the millionaire beforehand. The only thing that brings them together is a $10,000 reward for anyone who can stay in the haunted house overnight. As the plot unfolds, the guests gradually realize they are being locked up in a house full of death and ghosts, and there is no way to escape. Unlike other movies that use a series of ferocious creatures to create visual fear, “House on Haunted Hill” uses a series of plot twists to play with people’s minds, intriguing viewers to keep watching to find out the truth behind the haunted house.
“The Phantom of the Opera”
Originally a novel by Gaston Leroux, “The Phantom of the Opera” is an iconic work of Gothic fiction that has been adapted into a musical and a variety of films. The story focuses on a talented opera singer, Christine Daaé (Mary Philbin), and her relationship with a mysterious phantom (Lon Chaney) dwelling in the Paris Opera House. The phantom has a significant amount of power that he uses against anyone who hurts Christine or tries to take her away from him. When Christine falls in love with the young Vicomte Raoul de Chagny (Norman Kerry), the Phantom makes Christine his prisoner and decides to separate and torture the couple. Contradicting what the audience believes a film about opera should be like, this 1925 version of the film is actually silent. However, the phantom himself, his brutal revenge, and his dark and unfathomable underworld all serve to create a horrific atmosphere for the audience.
“Endless Night”
If you are into detective and crime stories, “Endless Night” may be an interesting film to add to your watch list. The film is an adaptation of the novel written by Agatha Christie, a renowned English author famous for her detective novels and plays. The movie tells the story of a working-class young man, Michael Rogers (Hywel Bennett), and his wealthy girlfriend Ellie Thomsen (Hayley Mills). The two fall in love and move to Gypsy’s Acre after getting married. However, Gypsy’s Acre appears to be a cursed land. Even though the couple does not believe in the local legend, tragedy still hits when Ellie is found dead mysteriously in the woods. The movie seems plain at the beginning but soon becomes more suspenseful as the audience realizes that almost everyone around Michael and Ellie appears to be suspicious.
“The Awakening”
This thriller embodies supernatural phenomena. It tells the story of a hoax exposer, Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall), and her experiences at a boarding school in Cumbria, England, in the early 1920s. Although Florence initially uncovers a supernatural hoax that took place at the school, she later finds uncanny phenomenons that she cannot explain. During her stay, Florence realizes that she can see ghosts at the school and gradually finds a connection between her past and the property. The story is a combination of suspense and romance, with different people hiding secrets and trying to recover from past experiences. This movie is an ideal choice for anyone who looks for a story that is not too bloody or terrifying. 
Aside from these recommendations, Kanopy also runs a number of black and white movies and silent films that date back to the early 1900s. It also provides various horror films and thrillers that include gothic, supernatural and monster genres, as well as psychological thriller and comedy horrors. Search for Kanopy and start your spooky Halloween!

As glasses clink, the gathering may seem to be an ordinary dinner, but expectations are exceeded when the main guests include empowerment, grace, fellowship and belonging. While USC may be a predominantly white campus, Kó Society is creating a community for Black women to find unrelenting support. 
Kó Society is an organization that aims to change what it means to be a Black woman on USC’s campus. The club, founded in Summer 2020, prioritizes the social, academic and professional needs of Black women by hosting monthly dinners, planning speaker series and raising funds for local charities. 
Founder Adenike Makinde, a junior majoring in real estate development, developed the idea of Kó Society a year before its culmination. She said the inspiration came from needing a space to spend time with her close friends on campus while navigating her busy schedule, and she figured organizing meals with peers was a good place to start.  
“I love going to eat,” Makinde said. “That’s my favorite thing to do is find new restaurants and explore different parts of L.A. I wanted to combine my passion for food and bonding and being able to connect with a big group.” 
The word “Kó” in Yoruba means “to bring,” which the club aims to do by fostering dialogue and community with people across different academic programs who bring their own insight, according to Makinde. The members on its e-board range in a variety of focuses of studies but all hold one driving passion: creating a safe professional social club for Black women on campus. 
“The root of Kó Society … it’s just the ability to connect, it’s transferable across culture and nations to connect over food,” Makinde said. “It’s just so seamless with all of us having very similar experiences.
Dining is the main undertaking of Kó Society. Last November, Makinde hosted a dinner with the Black women in her life that she had met in a variety of communities at USC. She had a thought: What if she made it a normality? 
“I felt like a lot of the social pieces that I’d seen in other communities at USC were not represented for Black women,” Makinde said. “From there, Kó Society was started as a social club really focused on bonding dinners around the city and then bringing USC alumni to those dinners to discuss professional development.”
In its earliest stages Kó Society served as a networking agency between Makinde and alumni she valued and admired. It has since evolved into something more representative of the community and space she wanted for herself and others like her. 
“It’s really morphed into helping Black women find their identity and find value in their facets of their culture,” Makinde said. “We’ve tapped into the community service outreach piece and again the professional development. [We try] to bring in speakers, not just from USC, but from all around the country, specifically Black women who have graduated from predominantly white institutions to come and speak with us and share their journey.” 
Makinde said she is aiming to expand the club beyond just USC because she feels Kó Society can play a major role in supporting Black women at other predominantly white institutions. 
The first series Kó is putting on this semester is The Care Collective: Workplace Wellness and Industry Insights, a speaker series featuring Black women in different professions and points in their careers to discuss how they have handled health and wellness throughout. 
Pilar Lee, a sophomore majoring in journalism, serves as the director of community outreach for Kó Society. Typically, Lee’s role would be to reach out to local schools to organize mentorship programs. While these programs are not accessible due to the coronavirus pandemic, Lee has been able to engage with the community in other ways, such as raising money for local foundations.
Lee said Kó Society has worked on forging a partnership with the Loveland Foundation, an organization committed to providing resources for communities of color and for Black women and girls in particular. The series will also collect donations for the Loveland Foundation.
“I think it’s so important to make sure we are building bridges for other Black women to feel okay,” Lee said. “It’s always so important to see yourself reflected in different spaces.” 
As for her long-term goals, Lee is excited to one day begin the mentorship program. Lee values mentorship deeply as said it has been a huge asset to her throughout her life. 
“I have had an older mentor sister type thing and that has always been a helpful nice little place to turn to,” Lee said. “What I want is to make sure that we’re doing this high school [and] elementary school outreach.” 
Lee said she admires the ability of Kó Society to get up on both feet amid the pandemic. Even though everything is remote, Lee said she enjoys watching the passion and determination portrayed by those in leadership roles.
Cydney Davis, a junior majoring in public policy, is the club’s director of alumni outreach. She has been involved in the organization since March. As a member, Davis said she has felt an unmatched sense of belonging and bonding with her peers in the club. The networking opportunities have made her feel empowered and have given her security unlike any other organization, she said. 
“Being with Black women … it’s just really an experience like no other,” Davis said. “You just feel so welcomed and so empowered. It’s just amazing especially when in times when you’re struggling, there’s no one that really understands you like a Black woman does.” 
A shared space between Black women on campus is valuable and an important addition to the USC student body that hopefully can continue on, Davis said. 
“I’m really excited for the legacy it will leave at USC,” Davis said. “I know it’s kind of really long term and far fetched, but I just think that it’s really exciting to have an organization both professional, social and service oriented for future Black students who come to USC.”

The Undergraduate Student Government discussed USC Panhellenic Council’s reform plans during Tuesday’s Senate meeting, which include the council’s desire to improve diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and implement mandatory microaggression and implicit bias training for Greek life members. Representatives from the council pointed out that future reforms will need to be made to change Greek life.
Current Vice President of Community Relations and incoming President of Panhellenic Council Indu Gaddamadugu said Panhellenic’s reform plans look to establish transparency in Greek life and improve conditions, such as the recruitment process, for all students through reporting mechanisms such as Title IX.
With Panhellenic members recently completing a community climate survey to identify bias and discuss chapter history and areas of needed growth in Greek life, the organization also looks to require mandatory leadership training and consultations with incoming executive board officers, Gaddamadugu said. 
“We are mandating recruitment counselors to go through microaggression and implicit bias training as well as counseling, training on how to have difficult discussions with potential new members, and just establishing transparency between them and new members,” Gaddamadugu said. “In terms of internal education, we’ve been really focusing on this in the past few months.”
Recruitment fees also intend to be reduced during Spring 2021 Recruitment — with fees previously ranging between $80 and $120 to now $10 — to remove financial barriers of entry to the Greek community, Gaddamadugu said.
Sen. Max Gomez questioned council representatives if they would be willing to listen to student input regarding Greek life, particularly as calls to abolish the system have surged at USC and across the country from individuals and groups, including @abolishgreekusc on Instagram. 
The account surfaced over the summer alongside Black Lives Matter protests and anonymous submissions posted on @black_at_usc, with @abolishgreekusc also reiterating the normalization of “sexual assault, white supremacist ideals, and gender or sexuality-based discrimination” within Greek life. @abolishgreekusc has since shared anonymous stories of students previously involved in Greek life who have been excluded and systemically disadvantaged by the system.
“There’s the model of reform versus abolition of the system, and they made it very clear that they’re interested in reform, and they’ve directed a great effort and energy towards that which I applaud,” Gomez said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “But I think a lot of people would like to see it taken a step further.” 
The Senate also voted on resolutions introduced in last week’s meeting, such as the Resolution in Support of BIPOC Students — with Sen. Lennon Wesley III amending the name to be “Black, Latinx, Asian, Middle Eastern, Pacific Islander, Indigenous and all other students of color” — and the Textbook Information Resolution. Committee Chair on Academic Affairs Katelyn Lee also made an amendment to her resolution, which involved adding the Academic Culture Assembly as a supporter to the initiative. Both resolutions passed unanimously. 
During the meeting, the Senate confirmed appointments for Romir Karnick and Irene Fu as director and assistant director of Performing and Visual Arts, Cultural, and Startup Funds, respectively. The Senate also entered into talks surrounding the International Student Assembly Leadership transition, with plans to pass the co-executive and assistant director positions to Rui Daniel, Andy Song and Natasha Harianto. The three students are set to be confirmed at next week’s meeting.  
Sen. Jack Rasmussen also asked for USG to consider reviewing a circulating petition to move the pass/no pass policy to allow for grade changes until the end of finals week.

On a bright sunny day last August, my friends and I were walking along a small side street on our way back from the Goodwill on Figueroa. I was excitedly talking about the list of potential names I had come up with for this column. Reality hadn’t sunk in yet, and I was still reeling over the fact that someone — anyone — agreed to my having a column, much less one about weed, in the Daily Trojan.
I was shouting out names, but none of them seemed to stick until I blurted out the coveted “To Be Blunt” in a light bulb-like epiphany. Suddenly my friends turned around, shopping bags swinging, and I couldn’t contain my smile at the fact that I might just have something interesting on my hands, something worthy to say to an audience. 
Since its inception, I knew my column couldn’t shy away from anything — if I werewas aiming to break down stigmas, advocate for the substance, its decriminalization and benefits, meanwhile delving into the cultural connotations of weed, I had to be everything but bland and much more than earnest, without seeming preachy. I wanted to be taken seriously, but not too seriously. Because, honestly, what’s a weed column without a few puns (hello? This column’s title?) and obligatory lighthearted jabs about how everyone should smoke weed and just, like, chill out man? 
In doing so, I never considered my column would gain a life of its own, from random messages on LinkedIn from middle-aged white male startup entrepreneurs asking me if I could promote their new cannabis product that would totally revolutionize the industry to a fellow peer I had met in passing pointing at me and just saying my column name at me. 
I also never dwelled on “To Be Blunt’s” impact on my job security, at least not until a couple of friends asked me if I was afraid I’d be passed up on opportunities for discussing such a taboo subject and implicating myself in the process. The truth is I considered the risk only in passing, and ultimately I’m glad I did; I’d never want to work for a company or publication that was not forward-thinking in its cannabis drug policy and progressive in how it reports on cannabis. And I’m not sorry about it.
But this doesn’t mean I’m not nervous either, both because of my penchant for leaping to the worst-case scenario and the fact that I have the residue of the fear of God inside me from my overly religious elementary school upbringing. 
At the outset, I also grappled with how personal I wanted to get with this column and how much I really wanted to reveal to who knows how many readers comprising some of my peers, professors and maybe the occasional Twitter-verified journalist (I’m definitely reaching). In the end, I decided I couldn’t work at destigmatizing the substance on paper if I didn’t simultaneously work to purge the internalized stigmas I held. I have no shame in using weed as a medicinal — and occasionally recreational — substance, and I’ve written at length about the personal ways it has transformed not only my life but the lives of those around me, too.
But as with all good things, “To Be Blunt” must come to an end. Perhaps that’s much too presumptuous, but I feel that I’ve covered the main bullet points of the cannabis world, from its racialized history to its global cultural significance and healing properties. 
And this leads me to my parting words, as I say farewell to this column and close this chapter in my journey as a writer. There’s so much I could still say through this platform and so many topics within the world of weed that I have yet to discuss: the rise of cannabis within the makeup and skincare industry (rapid and overwhelmingly white), if cannabis actually lowers IQ (nope) and the correlation between schizophrenia and heavy use (that we’re not sure of yet), to name a few. 
But ultimately, I hope I’ve conveyed the importance of global decriminalization and legalization; I hope I’ve emphasized the vital need for rapid restorative justice for those currently incarcerated for petty drug charges and equity programs for cannabis entrepreneurs of color. At the very least, I hope this column taught you something, changed your perspective on the substance and made you smile. 
As I move onto greener pastures (had to throw one more pun at you, not sorry about it), the fight for cannabis justice is not over. Cannabis is on the ballot in five states, with an additional six pending campaigns for 2022. Weed taxes in legal states fund police departments, which only terrorize marginalized communities of color and contribute to the expansion of the weed-to-police pipeline, making it clear that the War on Drugs is far from over. 
Cannabis is just a cog in the larger machine of institutionalized racism, and each of us can and should do so much more to educate ourselves and spread awareness about the need to make cannabis accessible, non-criminalized and just.

USC’s Health Sciences Campus will serve as a voting center for the 2020 general election, according to a Health Sciences Campus news release. The center, which will be located on the first floor of the Soto 1 building at 2001 N. Soto St., will be active from Oct. 30 through Nov. 3. This is the first time HSC will serve as a polling location for the surrounding community. 
The polling center’s creation comes in part from Annette Gibson, director of ambulatory care for women’s health at Keck Medicine. Gibson, who frequently works with the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk’s Office, was contacted by the county in September with an urgent request to establish another voting center in the area. 
“I was very excited about the possibility because this is such an important election and people need as many vote centers as possible in their own neighborhoods, especially during a pandemic when some are quarantining,” said Gibson in the news release. “This was also an opportunity to let our local community know we are here to not only meet their health care needs but to support their right to vote.”
After HSC was suggested as a voting center, the county inspected the location to ensure that it fits requirements for square footage and parking among other technicalities. The Soto 1 building was then approved to hold polling for the upcoming election.
The Health Sciences Campus will be one of four voting centers within the ZIP code, according to the release. Along with the area’s residents, Keck Medicine employees and visitors who are residents of L.A. County will also be permitted to vote at the Soto location.
L.A. County will be administering several safety precautions at the voting location to ensure that people can poll with protection. All voting centers in the county will provide face masks, gloves and hand sanitizer to voters. Check-in stations and ballot-marking devices will be physically distanced from each other as well. Voters are also encouraged to further protect themselves by using a face shield or glasses in addition to wearing a mask.
The Galen Center at the University Park Campus will also serve as a polling location for the general election from Oct. 30 through Nov. 3.

Leave it to 2020 to find a way to make natural disasters simply more disastrous. Evidence shows that as our climate continues to heat up, hurricanes are getting stronger and more destructive. Tropical storm systems — from Atlantic hurricanes to Pacific typhoons and Indian cyclones — are some of the most damaging natural disasters on Earth, battering coastlines and uprooting human life. 
Starting with a small atmospheric disturbance over tropical ocean water, moisture, heat and wind are all key ingredients that form the first step to a hurricane, called a tropical depression. As the system increases in intensity, it becomes a tropical storm, and once winds reach speeds of over 74 miles per hour, it becomes a hurricane. When a hurricane makes landfall, it can cause heavy rain, high winds, flooding and storm surges, bringing massive damage and often casualties with it. 
Running from June 1 to Nov. 30, with the strongest storms typically peaking in early September, the Atlantic hurricane season in 2020 has been abnormally active, with 25 named systems forming, including 10 tropical storms and five hurricanes hitting U.S. landmasses. 
Named to streamline and simplify communication, the World Meteorological Organization cycles six lists of alphabetized female and male names used to identify storm systems. If there are more than 21 storms in a system, like 2020, then the Greek alphabet is used to name the additional storms. NOAA estimates that damage incurred from hurricanes in the past forty years totals over $500 billion. 
While there is “no discernible trend in the global number of tropical cyclones” correlating with greater release of carbon dioxide emissions and increased global warming, it’s arguable that humans do have some effect on global weather patterns. The more fossil fuels that we release will cause increased temperatures across the globe and warming ocean water, priming the storm systems to develop more quickly. Scientists have noted that with more available potential energy, hurricanes aren’t necessarily occurring more frequently, but anthropogenic warming may contribute to more rapid intensification of storms. 
Not only are these natural disasters destructive and often deadly, but in the current pandemic landscape, they have the potential to be the catalyst for super-spreading events. As inhabitants of coastal cities flee for their lives, local lawmakers are forced to weigh the costs of ensuring physical safety at the risk of causing new outbreaks. 
The virus also throws a wrench in the straightforward goal of mitigating loss of life due to hurricane damages. Community-based testing centers will be forced to cease their regular routines, so the virus will be harder to track. Due to flooding and storm damages, each hurricane that strikes land forces many to uproot and live in temporary close quarters, sometimes without reliable sources of water and sanitation. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has actually published coronavirus guidelines specifically for natural disasters and severe weather, offering advice to minimize the risk of infection while staying in temporary shelter. While it mostly covers basic guidelines like social distancing, mask-wearing and avoiding touching high-contact surfaces, it also advises people to organize a kit of personal hygiene items and disinfectants to take with them in the event of evacuation. 
While the information is helpful, it isn’t necessarily new. With no other place to go, shelter evacuees are stuck, forced to compromise on social distancing and sanitation measures in order to keep a roof over their heads. Additionally, shelters themselves must abide by social distancing measures, reducing capacity to make sure that there is enough space between inhabitants. 
There is also a strong likelihood that residents who are evacuating to shelters instead of staying with family or booking hotels further inland are more likely to be seriously affected by the virus, as they might have less access to things like health care and adequate insurance. There is no real solution to the dilemma –– emergency shelter managers must either risk spreading coronavirus to at-risk individuals by maxing out capacity or follow CDC protocols by turning people away and leaving them to their own devices to find shelter and safety.
This hurricane season, the CDC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency urged city officials to prioritize designating alternative emergency shelters like hotels, empty dormitories, convention centers and smaller shelters in order to provide adequate social distancing and prevent potential outbreaks. 
Some cities have taken preemptive measures by establishing pre-emergency contracts with local hotels and motels, effectively planning to quarantine hurricane evacuees from each other and attempting to manage the otherwise inevitable spread of the virus. However, this method isn’t sustainable long-term or is inadequate if too many people are displaced. Since hotels are public property, commandeering them for weeks on end with quarantined evacuees also presents financial concerns. Evacuations on the largest scale will inevitably hinder efforts in southern coastal states to mitigate the pandemic. 
While the coronavirus has undeniably complicated an already unprecedented season of natural disasters along U.S. coastal cities, the government, the CDC and FEMA have unquestionably fallen short. Even when there is an end to the pandemic in sight, global warming has ensured that stronger storms will be on the horizon. Yet the adequacy and availability of evacuation shelters leave much to be desired. If nothing else, this hurricane season should be a lesson –– the pandemic adds an undesirable plot twist to an already chaotic situation, post-natural disaster. From wildfires and earthquakes to floods and monsoons, emergency response plans should be updated to reflect the pandemic and keep everyone safe from both disaster and disease.
