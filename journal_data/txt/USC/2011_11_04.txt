The last time USC visited Folsom Field in 2002 it came away with a 37-point victory over Colorado. This time wasn’t much different.
Behind a single-game, school-record six touchdown passes from junior quarterback Matt Barkley, the No. 21 Trojans (7-2, 4-2) toppled the Buffaloes 42-17 in a rare Friday night primetime matchup.

“We talked all week how this is a trap game after the emotional loss last week,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said six days removed from a triple-overtime loss at home to No. 4 Stanford. “It was nice to see our guys play well despite all the injuries we have.”
Barkley’s record-setting pass came in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter, as he found freshman tailback Amir Carlisle on a 19-yard screen pass, ballooning the Trojans lead to 24, serving as the final scoring play of the game.
“It was awesome,” Barkley said with a grin. “The screen finally worked.”
The third-year signal caller had — on three separate occasions — finished with five touchdowns in a single game, against Hawaii and California in 2010 and against Syracuse earlier this season.
“I didn’t know it was going to come tonight,” Barkley said of his record-breaking display against the Buffaloes, who ranked to second-to-last nationally in passing touchdowns entering the game.
Though USC would finish with its third-highest scoring output of the season, it did trail in the early goings.
Colorado (1-9, 0-6) opened the game on a six-play, 69-yard drive that ended when quarterback Tyler Hansen found wide receiver Tony Clemons over the middle of the play for a 38-yard touchdown pass. It marked the Buffaloes’ first lead since an Oct. 1 game against Washington State.

But USC responded quickly, scoring 28 unanswered points in the first half — all touchdowns by way of Barkley, who would finish with 318 yards through the air on 25-of-39 passing.
On its first drive of the game, Barkley found freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee for a 33-yard touchdown pass. On the Trojans’ third drive, he found freshman tight end Xavier Grimble from eight yards out.
Lee would later conclude the first-half scoring outburst, catching a 25-yard pass from Barkley.
“The trust is there,” said Lee, who finished with nine receptions for 124 yards and two touchdowns. “And now it’s going to get better and better.”
In the aftermath, Lee rushed over to the sidelines, handing the ball to Kiffin after the first-year wideout notched his first two-touchdown game of the season.
“I was tired of being called ‘No. 9,’” Lee said. “You have to catch two touchdown passes for [Kiffin] to call you by your first name. So after I took the ball to him”
The Trojans, who started three freshmen on defense — all at linebacker in Lamar Dawson, Tre Madden and Hayes Pullard, proved rather stifling against the Buffaloes, limiting them to just one touchdown following the first series.
Hansen would find Clemons again in the fourth quarter, but USC’s lead was already well above 20 points by that time.
“We have a great class from top to bottom,” Carlisle said of the four true freshmen who started in Dawson, Lee, Madden and guard Marcus Martin. “We have a lot of talent out there and it’s going to be a bright future for USC. We have just been working hard.”
USC hosts Washington next Saturday at home in its annual Homecoming game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at 12:45 p.m.

How will USC’s secondary hold up?
With junior safety T.J. McDonald suspended by the Pac-12 for the first half of the game, the Trojans will likely start two reserves at the safety positions. Sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey has emerged as one of the best cover corners in the country, but the lineup change might present some chemistry issues for the defense, which has gelled as of late. Colorado’s senior quarterback Tyler Hansen has completed 56.7 percent of his passes with 14 touchdowns and 6 interceptions.
Will Barkley carve up the Colorado secondary?
Colorado’s secondary, which allows 249 yards per game through the air, ranks 92nd nationally in pass defense. In five conference games, the Buffaloes have surrendered 22 touchdowns—the third highest total in the nation—while forcing only three interceptions. Junior quarterback Matt Barkley is off to an impressive start for USC and will look to continue his success. He has completed 67.3 percent of his passes for 2290 yards and 22 touchdowns.
Can Curtis McNeal continue to run the ball well?
In the first half against Stanford, McNeal carried the ball five times for only four yards. Despite the slow start, the junior ran USC to a lead and provided a huge spark on the offensive side of the ball. Most will remember the running back for his fumble that ended the game, but his performance should not be discounted. McNeal finished with a career-high 145 yards on 20 carried and two touchdowns. With senior tailback Marc Tyler unlikely to play due to a shoulder injury, McNeal will receive the bulk of the carries against the Buffaloes, who rank 85th nationally in run defense allowing 185.7 yards per game.
Is USC’s defensive line in a prime position for a huge game?
Surprisingly, USC’s defensive line held its own against a dominant Stanford offensive line and pressured quarterback Andrew Luck last Saturday. In contrast to last week, USC faces an offensive line that has struggled to effectively protect its quarterback. Colorado has allowed 28 sacks, which ranks 107th nationally. Furthermore, the Buffaloes have failed to run the ball with any consistency. Colorado has managed only 90 yards per game, which ranks 114th nationally. Meanwhile, USC ranks 13th nationally in yards allowed (103 per game) and will look to make Colorado one dimensional.
