As a cool drizzle fell on Koreatown, the line for Jónsi Birgisson’s Sunday night show at the Wiltern wrapped around the block and curled itself into a buzzing snake tail, electric with excitement. The Sigur Rós frontman’s most recent SoCal stop, an abbreviated set during the final day of this year’s Coachella festival, had already stirred up fascination with his latest solo LP Go, an orchestral roller coaster that demands to be heard live and in its entirety. So the crowd was ready for his return to the area.
The spectacle that awaited beyond the Wiltern’s doors might have been the concert event of 2010.
Bennington, Vt., trio Mountain Man opened the evening with a stirring set of folk harmonics, aided by only a guitar but elevated by the haunting, painfully beautiful voices of Amelia Meath, Molly Sarle and Alexandra Sauser-Monnig. Their intimate set was a perfect precursor to Jónsi’s sonic symphony.
Jónsi took the main stage just after 9 p.m., sporting an intricately patterned shirt with red cloth tassels, somewhere between Pawnee and Tibetan in appearance. The crowd was quickly soothed to silence with a beautiful acoustic rendition of “Stars in Still Water,” carried by the spare chimes of a xylophone and Jónsi’s unmistakable, alien falsetto, a voice that brought many to tears.
After a roar of applause, Jónsi’s four-man traveling band consisting of boyfriend Alex Somers and three fellow Icelanders took its places behind an impressive arrangement of guitars, harmoniums and drums.
Yet, instead of launching into the punchier singles of Go, Jónsi and Co. segued into the soft, hymnal “Hengilás,” delving into the song with patience and passion, letting every soft note resonate.
Since his emergence into the popular music scene with Sigur Rós, Jónsi has explored a cathartic, almost primal realm with his work, one that very few artists can claim to have even touched. The world of Jónsi’s music is free of cynicism and driven by the barest of human emotions, the kind many of us can only recall feeling as children. It is the same power that has the branded the likes of Tolkien and Debussy into the hearts of generations.
As Jónsi’s set built throughout the night, the show took on a feeling of timelessness, as though the audience members were witness to something that might not come again in their lifetimes. “Icicle Sleeves” moved the show into post-rock territory, with Thor Thorvaldsson’s thunderous drums kicking the song to a higher plateau. The storm brewed further with “Kolnidur” and “Tornado.”
If the aural beauty of the songs, both violent and calming, was not enough to ensnare the minds of all those present, the visual accompaniments were. The band played before a large screen upon which physical scenery was projected, sculpting the atmosphere of each number.
From deciduous trees to penciled animals to burnt warehouse windows, the band’s backdrop managed to transcend the usual projected fare and take on a life of its own, transforming the Wiltern into forests, factories, fires and more.
Never was this more effective than during “Sinking Friendships,” when water began to drip down dirty panes of glass, gathering on the stage. Then, as the song built to its climax, it bubbled back up in a torrent, a virtual ocean as it reached the ceiling again.
By the time Jónsi’s notably more kinetic numbers “Go Do” and “Animal Arithmetic” reared their heads, the crowd was ready to dance. Jónsi himself seemed most playful here.
When unencumbered by his guitar or ukulele, he gallivanted about the stage, singing to the crowd and even making the occasional birdcall or growl into his microphone. It was both an amusing and touching sight to behold.
After closing the initial set with both the acoustic and electric version of “Around Us” and a brain-bending vocal sample solo twisted into unrecognizable shapes by guitar pedals, Jónsi returned to the stage in a colorful feathered headdress and tore into the frenetically fun “Sticks And Stones.”
The crowd appeared game for anything, some dancing without a care in the world, others simply basking in the sounds around them.
The night’s undeniable powerhouse came with the band’s final song, “Grow Till Tall.” As Jónsi slowly worked his way through the song’s gorgeously melancholic vocals, building to one chilling, repeated line, his bandmates gradually emerged with their own instruments. The sound built to a deafening wall of My Bloody Valentine-worthy feedback amid crashing lights, with Jónsi’s heart-stopping voice still audible through the maelstrom.
By the time the show was over, Jónsi and his backing band had created both a musical and visual spectacle.

Upon hearing Elizabeth and The Catapult for the first time, it’s hard not to feel like the sound has been done before. Who does the group sound like? Sara Bareilles? Ingrid Michaelson? Florence Welch?
But the key to the band’s jazzy-pop tunes is to keep listening — it gets better.
More than zero · In its sophomore album, Elizabeth and the Catapult starts off slow but comes into its own with its fourth track. - Photos courtesy of Daffodil Publicity 
The Other Side of Zero is the Brooklyn-based trio’s noble follow-up to its 2009 debut album Taller Children. The 11-track album,  which will be released Oct. 26, takes the listener on a journey fraught with many honest emotions.
With heart-wrenching piano ballads and energetic whistles, eerie harmonies and catchy guitar riffs, the band produces a record that is raw, scrappy and original.
The content of these songs ranges from love and loss to broken dreams to growing older.
The record opens with “Time (We All Fall Down),” in which Elizabeth Ziman shows glimpses of vocal prowess, albeit with reservations. The song is catchy — no doubt about that — and as the first track on the band’s sophomore album, it makes lofty promises for creative loops, poppy fun and something relatively new.
The record doesn’t reach its peak until the fourth track, “Thank You For Nothing.” This song is simplistic and full of raw, emotional paradoxes, shedding all of the cool gimmicks and tricks in favor of stripping it down to its core: a soft piano ballad, a basic guitar riff, the occasional cello chord chiming in and a hauntingly truthful voice from Ziman.
The song explores the painful paradoxes of an honest love. Ziman croons, Thank you for everything, thank you for nothing / For every door opening, there’s another one slowly closing / Thank you for loving me, thank you for leaving.
It may be the grains of reality sprinkled among the painful paradoxes or Ziman’s sad, honest voice. Either way, you can’t help being fully disarmed by this tune.
Ziman’s voice is best when raw. It delivers the most powerful impact when it isn’t overshadowed by upbeat jangles and experimental clashes. Treasures lie in simplicity, and this song proves it. The song does what Ziman had hoped to do but failed at the start — make a musical declaration of the band’s originality to the new listeners and its newfound emotional maturity to the old followers.
The next track, “Go Away My Lover,” is a quick turnaround from the simple, sentimental experience of “Thank You For Nothing.” The song is a lot more assertive and experimental, utilizing all sorts of sounds from the twangy drumbeats to scratchy muted strums to sharp claps and whistles.
The duet is a bitter exchange between a couple whose best days are behind them. More than sentimental or heart-wrenching, this song is borderline comedic, as the only thing that the couple seems to agree on is the refrain, Go away my lover, darling won’t you go / Leave me to my tower, leave me all alone.
Another song that deserves a notable mention is the title track, “The Other Side of Zero.” Slow and sentimental, the tune is reminiscent of the emotional rapture that is “Thank You For Nothing.” However, the band adds more elements in this track with comprehensive vocal harmonies crooning, Whatever shall be, shall be.
This track is bound to strike a chord in your heart.
Elizabeth and The Catapult showcases a variety of musical prowess in its sophomore album, but the band will only wrench itself away from the flock only by sticking to the basics.

At the age of six, Bear McCreary knew that he wanted to be a film composer.
By 24, he was scoring Battlestar Galactica.
As one of the select protégés of the late Elmer Bernstein (The Magnificent Seven, To Kill A Mockingbird) at the USC Thornton School of Music, McCreary was groomed for success in the industry from early on.
After graduating from USC, McCreary distinguished himself with innovative compositions for the SyFy channel’s most popular program — Battlestar Galactica — which would earn him acclaim and wunderkind status. McCreary would continue with the show for four seasons, as the Battlestar soundtrack soared to the top five of Amazon.com music sales charts. Season four’s album even charted in the Billboard Top 150.
Over the years, McCreary has also scored successful television ventures such as Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Trauma, Eureka, Caprica and Human Target. More recently, McCreary provided a score for the film Step Up 3D, deviating effortlessly from his previous styles.
This fall, he began work on The Walking Dead, in intimate collaboration with the esteemed Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile). And in 2011, McCreary is poised to compose a full orchestral score to NBC’s superhero drama The Cape, amid various narrative feature projects.
He is only 30 years old.
Blessed with desire from early adolescence, McCreary exhibited tunnel vision in regard to his career. Inspired by Alan Silvestri and other musical titans, he searched out a personal style and sound within the music of his heroes. There was one man, however, who would change his life forever, and in the most unexpected way.
“My personal heroes are the composers who first addicted me to the art form: Jerry Goldsmith, Bernard Herrmann, Danny Elfman, Alan Silvestri, Ennio Morricone, John Williams and Basil Poledouris,” McCreary said. “However, at the top of the list would be Elmer Bernstein.”
McCreary came in contact with Bernstein in high school and was subsequently brought on as his protégé, studying with the master of both film and theater composition for seven years. The mentorship would suffice as a conservatory experience, during which McCreary’s dreams were affirmed daily.
For McCreary, Bernstein represented a man who had defied the odds and transformed himself into a Hollywood icon. It was a tangible and life-affirming journey for McCreary in that he was constantly reminded of what he was working toward and also consistently empowered to widen his scope of possibilities.
The thing that we must not dismiss, however, is that Bernstein first saw something in McCreary; he heard something in this high school student’s music that compelled him to make a seven-year investment.
It would seem that Bernstein, the oracle that he was, understood not only the potential in the maturity of McCreary’s work but also his passion for the art form that would outlast any skepticism. He sensed the desire, not simply the talent, which are mutually dependent characteristics for an artist.
“Despite a few occasional diversions into filmmaking or videography in middle school, I’ve never strayed from my path towards being a composer,” McCreary said. “It has been my singular professional focus virtually my entire life.”
Whether we are 17 or 79, there are moments that bring us back to our childhood. There are people that remind us of who we were and how we dreamed, and this is the basis of mentorship. It is the reincarnation of an unconscious-yet-shared life dream.
But McCreary’s story doesn’t end here. What his career represents really goes to the heart of “dreammaking” as a whole.
Yes, McCreary was given the opportunity of a lifetime, but he was preparing for that moment since he was six years old. He took hundreds of piano lessons, collected every soundtrack imaginable and was able to capitalize on this stroke of luck that probably would never have presented itself again.
No matter how sophisticated technology becomes, McCreary is a testament to how raw talent and determination remain paramount. Yes, people are still unfairly handed jobs, but the majority of successful individuals prepare, sacrifice and ultimately get what they deserve.
“Don’t make the mistake of approaching it casually,” McCreary said. “However, if you know in the bottom of your soul that you must write music for your life to be fulfilled, then dive in and embrace it.”
Whatever happened to the idea of college as a place to learn and to achieve, instead of a last hoorah before we are forced to work desk jobs for the remainder of our lives? What if we were here to make something of ourselves and to carry that over into our post-college careers?
USC is the opportunity of lifetime. It is the opportunity that many people will never have, but many dream of having.
Something like that might be worth a little sacrifice.

If Die Antwoord is a joke, then people are falling for it. And they have no reason not to.
The South African hip-hop/rave hybrid captivated the Internet last year with a couple of strange videos that featured shocking images, strange rapping and ridiculous characters. Much debate occurred about the legitimacy of the videos, with many people guessing they were created for some strange viral marketing purpose.
At the group’s sold-out show at The Music Box in Hollywood on Sunday, all that chaotic and grotesque weirdness was transformed into an energetic live show that was very much real.
Los Angeles-based Blok opened the show with its loud, overdriven brand of electronic hip-hop. Though a few members of the audience nodded their heads to the music, the Blok band members did little more than strangely contort their bodies and yell incomprehensible lyrics over loud, intense beats blaring from an unmanned laptop. Their performance was more a spectacle intended for some sort of shock value than a musical showcase, as androgynous back-up singer Gianna Gianna ripped off a blonde wig and the other members performed what seemed to be pre-rehearsed dances.
As Blok left the stage and the curtain went down, the excitement level rose. The anticipatory cheers and chants from the tightly packed crowd demonstrated that Die Antwoord has moved far past its original status as a confusing, occasionally comedic yet always entertaining meme on the “Interwebs,” as front man Ninja called it.
The show began with an extended intro as the curtains displayed a projected image of Leon Botha, the South African artist and hip-hop lover that has progeria, a rare genetic disorder that causes people to age faster than normal. Botha also appears in the video for “Enter the Ninja,” the song that propelled Die Antwoord to international fame.
As the curtains drew back, the beginning of the song “Fok Julie Naalers” played over the speakers, with a masked and hooded DJ Hi-Tek popped up from behind the DJ booth.
Yo-Landi Vi$$er, the overtly rude and extremely high-pitched female member, was next to emerge. She kept her middle finger pointed at the crowd as she began yelling the song’s opening lyrics over the screams of excitement.
Ninja, the group’s main rapper, came out last. He donned the same, frightening black robes and mask that he can be seen wearing on the cover of the group’s first album $O$. After a short, crowd-pleasing verse, the rapper disappeared from the stage.
He returned quickly wearing a sleeveless “I Heart LA” T-shirt (although a gun replaced the usual heart symbol) and, surprisingly, dove into the band’s most popular song, “Enter the Ninja.” During the third song, “Wat Kyk Jy,” Ninja tossed the T-shirt to the side of the stage and dove into the crowd several times. He and Vi$$er’s loud, energetic raps had the crowd jumping and dancing along.
Ninja soon had the crowd say “Wat Pomp,” a colloquial term for “What’s up,” to fellow South African rapper Jack Parow, who joined the band onstage for the song named after the same Afrikaans slang greeting. Keeping up with the Die Antwoord members’ ridiculous costumes and high energy, Parow wore a hat with an enormously oversized bill and maintained a commanding stage presence.
This energy failed to slow throughout the group’s fast-paced, one-hour set. The band’s continual costume changes and crowd interaction kept things interesting.
For instance, Vi$$er left the stage briefly, only to reappear in a gold jacket and matching gold spandex pants to sing her song “Rich Bitch.” Throughout the song, she pulled down her pants and mooned the crowd several times. She also repeatedly chugged a water bottle and spat its contents on the crowd.
Ninja also left the stage mid-set and reappeared wearing only his signature Pink Floyd boxers. During one song, he wore a strange, alien arm, a reference to the “prawns” in the movie District 9, which is set in South Africa.
Much of Die Antwoord’s lyrics mirror the images of the poor and oppressed depicted in that movie. The group claims to be “zef,” which they described as the South African equivalent of white trash.
This has caused some controversy over the legitimacy of Die Antwoord, as Ninja has appeared in other hip-hop groups as several other highly different characters throughout his career. Ninja and his crew might be playing overly ridiculous and exaggerated characters, but it doesn’t really matter. They’re still highly entertaining, and U.S. crowds still love them.
The break between the last song, “Beat Boy,” and the encore was only about 30 seconds, and then the band members re-emerged wearing their most ridiculous costumes of the night. Ninja was dressed in a Pikachu costume with one arm cut off, and Vi$$er was dressed as bloody pink animal costume. Parow also rejoined the group as it ended the night with the rousing anthem, “Doosdronk.”
As Vi$$er and Ninja stood at the front of the stage with sustained, angry frowns, Vi$$er loudly urged the audience to be happy. The loud cheers from the still-packed crowd proved that they already were.
BLOK is pretty avante garde but I LOVE them. They have a Monday night residency @ Detroit bar in November. CANT WAIT!!!!!!!!
Well,you either get it or you dont. I was in the balcony and everyone around me was rockin and singing along to BLOK. To each his own…Die Antwoord adores BLOK. Cant wait to see them at Pehrspace!!!!
Didn’t really dig Die Antwoords shtick but LaLaLAloved Blok. Seen them twice at LaCita downtown. Jesse and Gianna Gianna are beautiful and amaaaaazing dancers. Their songs are BRILLLL and I want to have Damien B’s babies ASAP
WOW….really, you loved BLOK. I think they are the worst band i have seen in a LONG time. 
I mean i like the weird and crazy, but they were horrible and hard to even listen to. The whole upper balcony was playing Angry Birds on their iphones during their set
Die Antwoord rocked! Was interested to see BLOK because I knew Die Antwoord and alot of other industry people are huge fans of theirs. Also know they have won a slew of music awards but have only heard their music on MYSPACE. Personally I loved them. They are totally uninhibited and organic.I have seen Gianna Gianna and Jesse St. John at a few industry get togethers and clubs(and at an LA area thrift store the other day) and they dress the exact same way as thay do on stage. No gimic there.They have a huge underground club following and i intend to join it. I thought they were no more than the hipster flavor of the week but they have won me over. By the way is there a better or faster rapper out there than Damien B these days? P.S. Gianna Gianna has a curvy MAXIM style body. Never saw a dude with one of those. She is tall but then again she was wearing like 8 inch platforms. I think shes hot as hell.
Honestly, the whole time I was trying to figure out whether Gianna Gianna was a woman or a cross-dressing man. And Blok’s set was way too “conceptual” and “artsy” — I felt like they were just trying too hard to be meaningful and edgy, and spent less time on constructing well-crafted songs. However, if I could understand the lyrics they were singing, then maybe I would appreciate the songs more.
My main complaint was that they didn’t even play a single instrument. If you enjoy their lyrics and screechy singing, then that’s fine, but when I go to see live music, I prefer the instrumental section to also be played live (or at least modified in some way during the set, like a DJ).
blok WAS amaaaaaaaaazing
“Androgenous” singer Gianna Gianna…dude are you straight?? Most beautiful chick I’ve ever seen.
Hell Yes….Hello Gianna Gianna Gianna Gianna!
Were you @ the same concert I was? I have been a fan and follower of BLOK for about 5 months now and been to several shows. I brought two friends from back east  who had never heard of BLOK(except from me)and they were surprised at the large number in the crowd who sang along and shouted the lyrics along with the group-particularly “Get on it”, “Butter”, and their i-tunes hit “Lair of the White Worm”. Their music is eerie and haunting and their lyrics are genius. Rehearsed?? They are widely known for no two shows being similar and that has definitely been this fan’s experience.Two of the promoters said they have never had so much interest and positive feedback on an opening act at that venue EVER.They are one of the only unique and inovative bands around L.A right now.  Brilliance is often misunderstood but the crowd excitement was hard to miss. P.S I am not a huge Die Antwoord fan but I met them after the show and they are super sweet!

“How did a nice girl like you end up in a cemetery?”
Hollywood Forever Cemetery tour guide Karie Bible gets asked this all the time. Standing steps away from headstones, graves and mausoleums just two weeks before Halloween, it’s hard not to wonder the same thing. Even if you’re not superstitious, it still feels uncomfortable to be in a cemetery this time of year.
Bible has been exposed to cemeteries since childhood because of her parents’ infatuation with Civil War history. She said that after visiting the Hollywood Forever Cemetery 10 years ago, she decided she belonged and became a tour guide two years later.
Not fade away - The Hollywood Forever Cemetery is the final resting place for many famous stars, from actors to musicians. Notable residents include actors Tyrone Power and Douglas Fairbanks, The Maltese Falcon’s director John Huston, and punk rock innovator Johnny Ramone. - Lindsay Cumming | Daily Trojan
Dressed as if she herself was from a different time, in a calf-length black lace dress and cropped black fur coat, she appropriately and eerily evoked the classic style of Hollywood’s Golden Age. Explaining both her outfit choice and her attraction to this creepy locale, Bible said that she wants to “bring history to life.”
As the tour starts on one of the few gloomy afternoons Los Angeles has seen in months, she begins to tell us the history of this somewhat unobtrusive landmark. Inconspicuous to most people driving down Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, it would take a lot of effort to actually notice it exists.
When Jules Roth purchased the cemetery in 1939, he quickly sold off much of the exterior of the property to make way for a strip mall and auto garages, which still block any decent view of the cemetery to this day.
Despite it being relatively hidden from view, the history of the place lives on inside the gates. Roth, the longtime owner and manager of the cemetery, was an infamous character who symbolized both the history of Hollywood Forever and the scandals that have plagued it for decades.
“He was so crooked he could have eaten soup with a cork screw,” Bible said.
A gangster in the 1930s, Roth purchased the cemetery just two years out of San Quentin Penitentiary.
His past remained with him as he ran Hollywood Forever, and upon his death in 1998, it was discovered that he not only kept a fully stocked wet bar in his office, but also a large pornography collection and spy records of all his employees.
Less sinister, but no less interesting, are the stories of the celebrities actually buried here. Located across the once-100 acres of burial grounds (40 acres were purchased for studio space by Paramount Pictures in the 1920s), visitors encounter loved ones lost, from the beginning of Hollywood’s history to the present day.
The cemetery is home to Florence Lawrence, the prolific silent movie star. Though Lawrence was not the first actress ever, Bible said that movie stars were originally left unnamed in silent films for fear they would demand more money with greater recognition. When Lawrence’s name was leaked — the first ever to be identified by the public — she was deemed “the first movie star.”
Hollywood Forever is the final resting place of many other well-known Hollywood icons, including Griffith J. Griffith — the man who gave his name to Griffith Park and Griffith Observatory — and Academy Award-winning director John Huston, of The Maltese Falcon fame, who was such a fan of Bushmills whiskey that fans frequently leave a bottle of it on his headstone.
Marion Davies, one of the best comic actresses of the silent era (though also remembered for her 32-year affair with newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst), is also buried here, in addition to Harold Rosson, the cinematography for the classic The Wizard of Oz.
Many other names make the list of “residents” here — including Nelson Eddy, Richard Blackwell, Janet Gaynor and Harry Cohn — that are hardly remembered by most generations today.
One look at the headstones and mausoleums these stars are buried in, or the flowers and lipstick marks covering their graves now, and it is obvious that — at least at one point — they were completely beloved.
As Bible said, “the work [of the graves] is how they really live on.”
Though not the spookiest of ways to celebrate the Halloween season, the tour provided an amazing wealth of knowledge about a Hollywood that will, thanks to this cemetery, live on forever.
The spirits of the stars that are buried here might not haunt this town ominously, but they do conjure up visions of the past — from a time when the movie industry was met with nothing but distrust and skepticism (and boarding houses in Hollywood with signs declaring “No Dogs or Actors”), to the Golden Age of Hollywood, when the movie industry thrived as never before.
From the peacocks that roam the grounds during the week to the unexpected mix of celebrities buried here, one thing is for certain — only in Hollywood.

Newly inaugurated USC President C.L. Max Nikias made an informal announcement last Thursday to USC news source Annenberg TV News that the university will add a Division I women’s lacrosse team to the athletics department.

The addition has not been formally announced yet, but it will come in the near future as coaching acquisitions are made, Nikias said.
“Pretty soon we are going to announce that we will introduce a women lacrosse team, Division I, at USC,” Nikias said to ATVN. “That is going to be announced in the next few months. We are in the process of recruiting the coach for the team and then we will make the announcement.”
According to Nikias, the move to add a lacrosse team comes as a result of the rising popularity of the sport, whose following has recently risen despite the long history of the game. He also mentioned that there are plans to add a men’s team in the future as well.
“Lacrosse is becoming very popular,” Nikias said. “It’s more popular in the East Coast, but now it is becoming more and more popular in the West Coast. I wanted to give priority to the women lacrosse and then in the next three to five years I think we are going to be in a position to also introduce a men’s lacrosse team.”
There are currently 91 Division I women’s lacrosse teams in the country, three at Pac-10 schools (the teams compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in women’s lacrosse) — Stanford, Oregon and Cal. USC will become the fourth.
USC currently has a women’s lacrosse club, which will continue to compete at the club level, said Erini Blakey, a senior captain on the team.
Blakey said she is excited about the opportunity the team will have to compete at a higher level in the future.
“It’s incredibly exciting,” Blakey said. “I think it’s a great opportunity for girls here but also for the sport in general. It’s such an East Coast sport, and to have a school like USC decide to put in a program is very big news. We’re all very excited for it.”
Blakey also noted that the growing demand both nationally and in California was reason enough for a team at USC.
“I think that our club’s success and growth might have caught the attention of the athletic department, but I think it is such a popular sport around the country that it [called for a team],” Blakey said. “The sport has gained a lot of popularity in California in the recent years. We are host to some of the best clubs in the nation.”
But although the new Division I team will draw a lot of talent to USC from the surrounding area, Blakey said she isn’t worried about a potential erosion of membership on the club side stemming from the new team’s creation.
“The girls on our team will have the opportunity to try out for the D-I team, which is a great opportunity for them. But there will also be great athletes who choose not to try out for the varsity team,” Blakey said. “It’s not going to negatively affect the club team; rather, it will promote the sport, which I think is wonderful.”
Once instituted, the team will become the 11th Division I women’s sport at USC.
YES!! We have so many solid high school programs (Foothill High, La Jolla) to feed the machine!! Super excited to see this.
What will be first year of NCAA intercollegiate play?
As a former Captain and President of the USC Men’s Lacrosse Team, I am incredibly proud of this day.  A lot of people put in a lot of work to build a solid club program which has paved the way for this opportunity.  This is truly thrilling!  Go Trojans!
As a USC alumni and father of a son who plays Men’s D1 lacrosse for Villanova, I’m thrilled at the announcement that lacrosse is coming to USC. As the floodgates open for growth in this great sport, I’m very happy that the leadership at SC is leading the way on the west coast for expansion of lacrosse at the Division 1 level. This is great news for USC!
I’m a lax dad from back east and it has made my day, seeing that USC is leading the way into DI lacrosse on the west coast. I can’t think of a better school to do so – as USC goes, so goes many many other FSB schools.
Congrats and welcome to the club! Well, actually, welcome out of the club and into the big time!
Good luck and see you at Hotbeds!
Exxxxcellent! …What’s a hotbeds?
You would be surprised Men’s Soccer … men’s lacrosse is HUGE!  DI men’s programs are putting 20-25K in NFL football stadiums for regular season events … REGULAR season … campus events for the big time programs average thousands more than their big time men’s soccer programs.  Look at a program like Virginia – men’s soccer wins the 2009 NCAA title, they never had home crowds like the men’s lax team that had capacity crowds. Fire Marshall shutting down the gates type of games …  Maryland lacrosse plays in their football stadium as does Syracuse … among others.
Look at TV – ACC programs like Duke, North Carolina, Maryland and Virginia play 80 percent of their regular season games on one of the ESPN family of networks — totally not the same for DI men’s soccer.  Baltimore had nearly 50K per game in Raven Stadium for the 2010 Final Four – which was a light year. 
Lacrosse is big time in the East and is becoming so in the West.   An athletic program like USC has the resources and the drive to play with the big boys from the get go if they start a program.  A USC lacrosse program does more for the campus then men’s soccer.  They would be a pioneer for more men’s programs in the West to build the DI footprint and fit the growing need of high school laxers looking for a place to play after high school.
Personally, I’d rather see a lacrosse team than a soccer team. Lacrosse is the fastest growing sport in the country. Almost anyone can play it, you don’t have to be big and crush everyone thus reaching out to a wide variety of students. Also, college lacrosse has the highest graduation rate of any other intercollegiate sport. It’s a good investment for USC.
AWESOME!!!!   To have any of the local Southern California colleges add a NCAA Division 1 program is outstanding!
Personally, I’d rather see a men’s soccer team than a men’s lacrosse team.  Students still won’t go to games for either, though.
[…] Game of the Day  Hatfield Smith Academy (Mass.) at South Deerfield Frontier Regional (Mass.), 7 p.m. Two of the Berkshires’ Big Three get together under the lights. Smith Academy, in head coach Sherry Webb’s final season as head coach, is one of the nation’s highest-scoring teams.

The BCS rankings were released Sunday, and you know what that means: The controversy has begun.
It may be a blessing for college football, it may be a curse, who knows? Whatever your take is, the Bowl Controversy Series rankings surely make for the kind of midseason drama that is not possible in any other sport.
Held back · While USC has begun to serve it’s bowl ban for the next two seasons, Oregon has managed to work it’s way to the top of the college football world. Although many polls suggest that the Ducks should be No. 1, the BCS computer system has left them hanging in second. - Daily Trojan file photo
As much as I pine for a college football playoff — I put it on my Christmas and birthday list every year, highlighted, in bold and double-underlined — I’ll concede that the ensuing weekly shake-ups sure make me much more attentive on Saturdays.
And with USC banned from the Coaches’ Poll because of sanctions, you won’t see the Trojans holding a spot in the BCS. So with completely unbiased goggles on, let’s look at two things we learned from this season’s first incarnation of what amounts to the antithesis of all that is good in competitive sports:
1. If computers are going to one day dominate the human race, then God help us all.
In numerous works of science fiction, computers grasp control of humanity because they are more logical than the whimsical human race. Computers are supposed to be impartial and balanced.
We humans know Oregon and Boise State are the two best teams in the nation. They have both looked untouchable this season. Nobody has come within 10 points of Oregon, not even Stanford (No. 12 in the BCS).
But who gets the top spot in the BCS? Oklahoma. The Sooners, who struggled to beat Utah State and Air Force, somehow get credit for beating No. 19 Texas (more on them in a minute), and No. 17 Florida State, the most overrated 6-1 team in the nation.
Moving on, in two of the six computer rankings that go into the formula, LSU is the highest rated team in the land. A computer clearly can’t understand luck, which is the only way to spin the Tigers’ victories against Tennessee and Florida.
Coach Les Miles won those games despite himself, and we humans know this. Yet all a computer takes in is the data of wins and losses, then spits out a No. 6 ranking for undefeated LSU.
Then there is two-loss Texas, a team that gets demolished at home by a UCLA team that proceeded to lose by four touchdowns to Cal the next week.
Yet after a win against Nebraska, Texas is the highest-rated two-loss team in the BCS.
If the BCS is a computer’s idea of reason, then I’m thinking about frying my hard drive right now and running for the hills before it corrupts my brain. Apparently, there is no mathematical logarithm for common sense.
2. An undefeated Boise State will not make it to the BCS national title game.
The Broncos started so high in the AP rankings this season (No. 3) that this was supposed to be the year the little guy finally busted into the big time. Based on the fact that the Broncos, No. 2 in both human polls, still ended up No. 3 in the initial BCS standings makes it clear that they will continue getting bucked as the season progresses.
Any undefeated team (except for fellow underdogs TCU and Utah, of course) will end up going to the BCS title before Boise State. Oklahoma could coast to an undefeated mark. Oregon already handled the second-best Pac-10 team when it beat Stanford. The SEC teams will knock one another out, but it’s even possible that a one-loss Alabama or LSU could get to go ahead of the Broncos.
So why the love affair with Boise State?
True, its schedule is as WAC as its conference but every time Boise’s put in the national spotlight, it rises to the occasion, such as against TCU in the Fiesta Bowl last year or against Virginia Tech at the beginning of this season.
How much more do the Broncos have to prove? They can’t strengthen their nonconference schedule because no major conference wants to play them outside of the Pac-10.
There’s no question Boise State vs. Oregon would be the most exciting national championship matchup imaginable. Those offenses and those coaches going head-to-head would produce one for the ages.
But it’s just a pipe dream. It will never happen. This is why I loathe the BCS. I hate the slightest idea that you can measure the talent of a football team with numbers.
I can’t mathematically prove that Boise State and Oregon are the best teams in college football. There’s just a sense, a human inclination that no computer could ever comprehend.
Human intuition could be just as dangerous as logical computers. But based on the rankings this week, I’ll put my faith in the humans while the BCS methodically deprives college football of a true national championship.
“Middle Ground” runs Tuesdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Josh at jjovanel@usc.edu.
Your criticism of computer rankings in general is unfounded, because the BCS computers have been neutered by humans due to “fairness” or “sportsmanship” concerns with regards to running up the score. Because of this fact, the BCS computers can only use wins and losses, and then you get results like this past week.  If you instead allow the computers to use the actual scoring margins (which happen to be the best single predictor of games), you get much better results. Take a look at Sagarin’s PREDICTOR ranking, or Massey’s regular rating, both of which use scoring margin, and you will find Oregon at number 1, and Oklahoma and LSU from 4 to 17 spots lower, just as your human intuition tells you.
It’s funny to see the OU bashing from USC who ran from NCAA sanctions for so many years and their former coach still can’t believe that anything really happened bad on his watch.   With Coach Kiffen I can tell you USC is pretty much the laughing stock of  most fans past CA.  But I do think USC is playing very well this year considering all the distractions.
Boise State got the better of OU will better coaching that game.  No doubt about that. Take this as a joke but I’m still waiting for Oregon to decline the gimme win in Eugene when they touched the ball before it went 10 yards and on top of that didn’t come up with the recovery.  If the OU player who held the ball up had had better sense he would have run it in for a TD.
Sure we all know that Oregon-Boise would be a great championship game. What?
Kinda like that turnover-suckerpunch-snooze fest they played last year. Or do you mean the Oregon squad that literally peed in their panties in the Rose Bowl against tOSU in January. And did you even watch the Boise-TCU Fiesta Bowl? Talk about two middleweights. 
Just because SC is sitting this one (or two) out, please don’t get the idea the rest of the Pac-10 has suddenly grown cajones. 
Oregon will lose at least one game during Pac-10 play. They always do. Boise will get exactly what they deserve for another unbeaten season.
Don’t tell me that other conferences won’t play Boise. They rejected a 2 and 1 series with OU.
Bad information…not true…my mistake…sorry.
Okay, here’s the latest that I’ve heard on the subject…
Back when the build up to the Feista Bowl matchup between Oklahoma and Boise State was building, one of the articles came out about how OU Athletic Director Joe C stated that OU was in the process of sending out 2-1 offers to all of the mid-major powerhouse teams for Oklahoma’s future OOC needs.  Joe mentioned that Boise was one of the teams that got on offer.
After the Feista Bowl game both the Boise State Head Coach and the BSU Athletic Director was approached as a follow up piece about Joe’s comment about Oklahoma’s 2-1 deal.
Both representatives stated that Boise turned it down for several reasons. The one’s that follow are what they stated in the piece :
#1: With the victory over Oklahoma, Boise State had NOTHING to prove and that their victory meant that they DESERVED a 1-1 deal. Oklahoma did not want this as it would hurt them fiancially.
#2: Boise State Head Coach Stated that Boise would receive no “benefit” from a three game series with Oklahoma and listed recruiting as a prime reason. He stated that Boise does not recruit the area where Oklahoma resides in and that they, (Boise), only wanted to play/schedule teams in the areas where they recruit, (i.e. MWC & Pac-10 teams).
Interesting fact was this was back in 2007. IF Boise would have accepted the three game series, (I am certain Joe could have made it a 1-1-1 series, (i.e. one game in Norman, one at a neutral location, (Jerry World, Denver, etc), & then one at Boise), then all of their crying & moaning would be moot at this point as they would have played Oklahoma this season.
Also, it is humorous to hear them scream & cry about the “big boys” not wanting to play them when it is known that Oklahoma attempted to play them.
Interesting sidenote here, Boise did have a three game series with Utah scheduled. However, the Utes had to cancel the series as they chose to carry one of their OOC games as the annual game against BYU every year.
I disagree with the assumption that Oregon and Boise St are the two most deserving and best teams in the land.  If that were a national championship game, Oregon would probably blow Boise out by 4 TDs.
My next point is the comment about Boise really impressing when they are in the national spotlight.  Boise got a whole month before facing TCU in the battle of two non BCS schools.  Boise got the whole off season to prepare for Virginia Tech and still had to have a key drive in the 4th quarter to win.  Yeah, that’s a real impressive resume.
Boise likes to schedule home and home games with the big boys as long as the games away from the blue turf is not actually the home field.  i.e. Virginia Tech.  however most big schools dont want to travel to boise to play in front of less than 35,000, where they actually lose money.  Let’s not forget it’s a money making business, this thing we call college football.
Last point,  Put Boise into a BCS conference where they dont get a month or an offseason to prepare for their “big games” and you get a middle of the pack school with 2-5 losses a year.  Put them in a situation where their schedule is this:  At LSU, Alabama, At Aburn, South Carolina, At Florida, Tennessee, At Mississipi State.
Or how about  At Oklahoma, Texas, At Nebraska, Missouri, At Texas A and M, Oklahoma State.
Or At Iowa, Ohio St., At Michigan, Wisconsin, At Michigan St.
Get my drift?  put them through some of those gauntlets and if they get through unscathed then they deserve to be in a national championship.
Fantastic article. A counterpoint:
Human intuition also said Utah couldn’t hang with the “big boys” in 2008 and were lucky Alabama was deigning from the untouchable SEC to blow them out in the Sugar Bowl. I also believe that Barry Switzer said Alabama wouldn’t have recruited a single player on Utah’s team and the talent gap couldn’t be overcome.
After Utah handed Alabama an ass whooping, that same flawed human intuition, fresh off of being proven dead wrong, ranked Utah, the only undefeated team in college football, #2 and #4 (WTF?). Utah’s average ranking in the computer polls post-bowls? #1. Conveniently, the BCS ignores the computer rankings post-bowls.
The moral of the story is sometimes human intuition is wrong and sometimes a computer with its admittedly flawed/biased algorithm can see the truth humans want to sweep under the rug.
Postscript: The Utah players that Barry Switzer claimed weren’t good enough to play for Alabama… So far 11 of the Sugar Bowl team have been drafted to the NFL, and that number could grow next draft. Someone needs to tell Barry that there’s more to talent scouting than looking at conference affiliation and making assumptions. Sometimes human intuition isn’t enough.
Well if USC can’t win it we should give it to another team that plays a weak schedule to keep the usc championship tradition of all flash but no actual test. WE COULD CALL IT HUMAN HUNCH. Get off your high horse. The team that plays the tough schedule and wins should go to the bcs championship even if sissies like you don’t like it

The players were gregarious, the fans were all smiles and the sounds from the Spirit of Troy marching band were blaring in the vicinity.
Pick-me-up · USC senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson (83) and redshirt freshman fullback Hunter Simmons talk with a child at the USC Childrens Hospital Los Angeles on Monday. The players were two of 16 football players to make the annual visit this year. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
This, however, was not the postgame celebration following the USC Trojans’ 48-14 rout of Cal inside the Coliseum on Saturday afternoon.
Rather, the setting for this intimate gathering marked a far different experience for the Cardinal and Gold than any conference win could provide: the team’s annual visit to the USC Childrens Hospital Los Angeles.
Just two days after the Trojans put on an aerial display against the Cal Golden Bears, 16 student-athletes from the football team, the USC Song Girls and members of the marching band made their way to the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center to take part in a day that was defined not by sacks and touchdown passes, but simply by giving back.
Decked out in their home uniforms, the players — which included senior quarterback Mitch Mustain, senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson, junior defensive tackle Jurrell Casey, senior tight end Jordan Cameron and reigning Pac-10 Special Teams Player of the Week senior kicker Joe Houston — were hands on from the moment they entered the door.
From playing Connect Four to racing fire trucks, to USC-themed arts and crafts, the Trojans’ annual visit to the center was more than a glorified photo-op — it was a chance to step away from the limelight on campus and into the reality that many of the hospital’s patients face every day.
“It’s always fun to see these kids, to see them light up,” Mustain said. “Being in a hospital is never fun, there is a reason why they are there, and issues they have to deal with everyday. A lot of it is serious stuff that they can’t even comprehend, so it’s nice to get them out of that element for a little while, and get them to do something else.”
What began as a day characterized by community outreach ended up as a unique bonding experience for the players outside the white lines of the playing field.
Although the initial intent of the visit was to raise the children’s spirits, hours later it was the players who said they left with a newfound appreciation that can’t be found in a jam-packed stadium or daily practices.
“I’ve done this a number of times, but it doesn’t get old to me,” Johnson said. “These kids would love to be in our position, so to come down and talk to them and give them encouragement, it feels great to me. It’s what we need to do as athletes.”
The team’s visit comes on the heels of a matchup with No. 1 Oregon on Oct. 30, giving the players a chance to represent the university off the field before they enter the biggest game they will face all season.
According to Prater, despite a showdown with the Ducks fast approaching, the importance of the visit was too high to forgo, noting that, in addition to helping the children, the trip to the hospital also benefits the USC players themselves.
“When you look back to when you were their age, kids are always looking up to somebody,” Prater said. “So to be in a position to be a model for these kids is inspiring for them and makes us look back and respect where we come from. It humbles us.”
i think you can work it out for yourself Doug.
You wrote “on the heels of a matchup with No. 1 Oregon on Oct. 30.” Are you implying the hospital visit came right after a game that has yet to be played?

It’s not uncommon for a young adult armed with a college degree and résumé to still be desperately job hunting after graduation.
All too often, the companies that grads are genuinely excited about working for will show interest and sympathy, only to regretfully state that no job openings are available.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
Dejected, these grads often spend the time between meaningful jobs making copies and coffee in an office with no potential for upward mobility.
College grads on the job hunt might also encounter companies that lower budgets and minimize costs through a motto of “last one hired, first one fired.”
Most people in this situation, however, are those that didn’t take full advantage of the resources afforded them by their college.
With the unemployment rate growing ever higher, stories like these are commonplace; studies by the Economic Policy Institute using statistics from the Bureau of Labor show that the unemployment rate among young adults is about twice the amount of the average rate among older workers, with young adults making up 26.4 percent of all unemployed workers.
And when taking these failures into consideration, students must also realize that they are not only searching for careers that will afford them a lifestyle of well-deserved success after the work put toward a college diploma — they are striving to pay off thousands of dollars of debt garnered by student loans.
With higher tuition prices, student loans are becoming an increasingly necessary part of a higher education. After four years, the average student loan debt runs a tab of almost $30,000, according to finaid.org.
Competing with older, more experienced workers, recent graduates are often forced to take jobs with meager pay and minimal benefits, or else they are thrust into jobs irrelevant to their area of expertise.
It seems as if a lose-lose situation arises — the baby boomers can justify their decision not to retire  with the lower wages and unstable guarantees of pension, but the economy can more effectively be stimulated by young adults with the potential of purchasing houses and cars. With the weight of loans upon our shoulders, these goals seem lofty at best.
There are still those who might mistakenly believe loans can be easily circumvented by declaring bankruptcy.
Attorney Mark Britton, the founder of online legal referral service Avvo.com, told The Wall Street Journal “with a student loan, the only asset is you and your income. If you walk away, the lender has nothing. So the laws make it very hard to walk away.”
But merely discussing the implications of student loans will not help the job situation for college graduates; we can find ways to reverse the situation.
Though the heavy competition in the workplace hinders the career opportunities of young adults across the nation, several things allow us, as USC students, to prevent the same fate story from playing on.
The key is not to wait until graduation to explore our various skillsets but to begin early, during our years in study — our years before facing the burdening task of repaying loans).
We also should not underestimate the power of the Trojan Family.
As USC students, we have so many resources at our fingertips — the Career Planning & Placement Center, academic advisers, career fairs, workshops and more.
We can learn how to write a résumé, conduct a job interview and become more efficient in all of our job-seeking ventures from speakers and professors who have been there and done that.
Only by taking advantage of these resources can we ensure a higher possibility of employment once we graduate, and therefore a chance to repay our loans as soon as possible.
By employment, I mean jobs that are suited to our skill levels that make our degrees worth the massive loan debt.
It is our job to be aware of both the climate of the current job market and of the sources that will help us compete in it, whether that means a summer internship, established connections, an improved résumé or even just freshly learned social skills.
It is our job to meet the right people, make the right first impressions and always be on our feet.

Recognize your mistakes and learn from it.
Be informed, and I definitely agree with Alice

skillsets but to begin early, during our years in study.”

Following the highly publicized suicides of at least six gay teenagers in September, the brutal torture of three gay men in the Bronx and the struggle over the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, October’s designation as Coming Out month seems all the more poignant this year for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
Coming Out month serves not only as a time to draw attention to hate crimes against LGBT members but as a time to reflect upon how far our society has come in terms of acceptance.
Alice Li | Daily Trojan
In the wake of the recent tragedies, an outpouring of support has flooded in from across the nation, including the It Gets Better Project, a website with videos from people reaching out to LGBT teenagers telling them that things “really do get better.”
At USC, hundreds of students, faculty, staff and members of campus organizations have already signed the OUTlist, a “declaration of support for the LGBT and Ally Community.” Oct. 18 marked the beginning of Ally Week, filled with events to show how allies can become involved in the movement toward equality.
We should applaud the strength of both the on-campus LGBT community and USC for its continued support of tolerance and acceptance.
USC is a very LGBT-friendly campus, even when compared to more “liberal” universities; The Advocate College Guide to LGBT Students consistently ranks USC among the “Best of the Best: Top 20 Campuses” colleges for LGBT students. The Campus Climate Index also gives USC the highest-possible rating for diversity and open-mindedness.
The Rainbow Floor in Century Apartments offers an opportunity for LGBT students and their allies to live in an educational and supportive environment.
USC hosts the Faculty and Staff Allies Program, winner of the 2006 Outstanding Program Award from the USC Division of Student Affairs, to educate faculty and staff on LGBT concerns and history.
USC’s highly praised LGBT Resource Center and affiliated organizations, such as the Queer and Ally Student Association and the Lambda LGBT Alumni Association, are holding a series of events (including LGBT T-shirt sales) in celebration of Coming Out month.
October was selected as Coming Out month to commemorate the first march on Washington by a LGBT rally in 1979. National Coming Out Day on Oct. 11 had already attracted public attention, so the recognition was extended to cover the entire month.
As the name suggests, Coming Out month provides a chance for LGBT students to “come out of the closet” and reveal their orientation to those close to them, though, of course, the choice of when or how to come out rests with each individual.
In fact, Coming Out month serves more as an encouragement for LGBT students to accept who they are and to raise awareness for LGBT issues rather than a definitive coming out time period.
For allies of the LGBT community, it’s often still difficult to know what to do or how to help without feeling intrusive.
The individuals committing violent hate crimes might be on the fringe of more extremist anti-gay movements, but just because someone isn’t actively discriminating doesn’t mean they aren’t being judgemental or unsupportive.
As an ally, the best way one might counter a disgusted look or condescending gossip is to still offer continual, whole-hearted support.
Whether or not we personally agree with LGBT issues, there is never an excuse for the bigotry and physical and psychological abuse faced by members of the LGBT community.
We should be proud of USC for fostering an environment of support and respect.
Regardless of sexual orientation, religious beliefs or personal opinions of the LGBT community, Coming Out month reminds us of our shared values.
We all stand for the ideals of tolerance and acceptance of differences — in this sense, we are all allies.
To the LGBT community: Fight on!

Everything was going right for the Trojans in their game against California on Saturday. But then
with 3:58 left in the 48-14 victory over the Golden Bears, senior running back C.J. Gable landed
awkwardly on his left knee after being tackled by two defenders.
The injury put a bit of a damper on the victory; Gable is a fifth-year senior, and it is possible that
he has played his last game in college.
After the game, coach Lane Kiffin told the media that Gable had torn ligaments in his knee, and
that his season was over. USC officials have since amended Kiffin’s statement, however, stating
that the injury is not yet determined.
Prior to the injury, Gable had been enjoying his best game since 2008. The tailback rushed for 72
yards on 13 carries and returned two kickoffs for 56 yards.
The injury deals another blow to the Trojans’ running back corps, who were without freshman
tailback Dillon Baxter on Saturday due to a toe injury.
For Gable, it is another setback in a college career full of them. Ever since earning the starting
job before his first game as a freshman, Gable has experienced a variety of injuries and letdowns
on his way down the depth chart. He experienced a bit of a resurgence in 2008, rushing for 617
yards and reeling off several highlight-worthy plays like this touchdown reception.
But prior to Saturday’s game, Gable was fourth on the depth chart behind Baxter, senior tailback
Allen Bradford and junior tailback Marc Tyler. And unfortunately for him, he may not get
another chance to reclaim his starting job.
“[I feel] real bad,” Gable said. “I was getting my opportunity to show what I can do and then this
[injury] happened.”

Want to see Barbara Boxer when she comes to USC on Friday?
The California senator will host a fundraiser luncheon with President Barack Obama at noon in the Grand Ballroom of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, before the president’s 1:30 p.m. rally in McCarthy Quad.
Tickets to the “Boxer Victory Fund Luncheon” are available — at a hefty price.
The starting price is $500, which results a “guest” seating, according to information from ActBlue, an online fundraising mechanism for Democrats. Spending $1,000 reserves a seat at the luncheon, $2,500 a spot at a preferred table and $10,000 a place at a photo reception.
The highest ticket — which at $32,800 is more than three-fourths of USC’s tuition for the 2010-2011 school year — allows attendance to the “host and photo reception.”
Those wishing to go to either the photo reception or the host and photo reception needed to have submitted an RSVP by Oct. 15. Other tickets are still available.
Welcome to the world of congressional/senate political fund raising. Those are typical prices for private fundraising events for both Gop and Dem candidates. Sadly, those will continue to be the prices because it is such a necessity for candidates to have large campaign warchests to run expensive television campaign ads. Will there ever be a day when political candidates can win on their platform, character, and record versus how much moolah they can raise?

After years of waiting, Lord Of The Rings fans can now look forward to The Hobbit films in the near future.
According to the New Zealand Herald, Sir Peter Jackson, the Oscar-winning director of Lord Of The Rings trilogy and the 2005 remake of King Kong, will be producing and directing a two-part film based on the novel of the same name by J.R.R. Tolkien.
With the leaving of director Guillermo Del Toro, who was initially appointed to work on the film with Jackson,  and MGM’s financial problems, the movie’s production has been delayed for many months.
Now, New Line and MGM have officially given to go-ahead for the shooting of The Hobbit, which is scheduled to start in February 2011.
And great news for the die-hard Tolkien lovers — the movie will be in 3-D.
“Exploring Tolkien’s Middle-earth goes way beyond normal film-making experience,” Jackson said in a the statement. ““It’s an all-immersive journey into a very special place of imagination, beauty and drama. We’re looking forward to re-entering this wondrous world with Gandalf and Bilbo.”
It will take a lot more than simply bringing back the magic and wonders of the Lord Of The Rings fantasy to satisfy critics and fans. The first film is expected to hit the screens December 2012.

There were no ESPN cameras or jam-packed crowds inside the Galen Center Friday afternoon when the USC men’s basketball team officially began practices for its upcoming, sanction-free season.
Midnight Madness took a back seat to a much calmer, serene setting as the Trojans took the court for the first official time since their 2010 campaign concluded prematurely at end of Pac-10 play.
The reason: a newly instituted practice admittance policy conjured up by the university and its Office of Compliance.
As the program tries to turn a corner from a year which was marred by self-imposed sanctions, the new regulations serve as a reminder to the media, scouts, family, friends and anyone in between, that USC under the direction of Athletic Director Pat Haden will be far more vigilant in upholding the NCAA’s compliance policies.
Under the new policy, practices shall be strictly limited to the men’s basketball team student-athletes and coaching staff, necessary athletic department personnel and guests pre-approved by the Vice President or Associate Vice President of Athletic Compliance.
Media, immediate family members of student-athletes (including parents, legal guardians, grandparents, siblings, spouses and children of student-athletes), spouse and children of basketball staff members, USC Executive Employees and their escorted pre-approved guests, and other pre-approved guests may attend practice by requesting and receiving permission to do so from the Office of Athletic Compliance at least 48 hours in advance of a practice.
In addition to these strict guidelines, the new policy much like one enforced for football practices at the Howard Jones field, requires admitted guests to sign a Practice Court Admission Form before entering a team practice for the first time.
Fans and students will get to the see the team uninhibited from the stringency of the new terms of admission on Oct. 23 when the new-look Trojans hold their annual Cardinal and Gold Scrimmage at 12:30 p.m. inside the Galen Center.
