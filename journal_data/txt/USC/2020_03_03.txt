USC women’s basketball forward Alissa Pili was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Year Tuesday, becoming the fifth Trojan in program history to receive the honor and the first since guard Briana Gilbreath in 2009. 
“It was exciting,” Pili said of hearing the news. “It was definitely a big accomplishment. Just knowing that I’m making so many people proud, it just makes me happy.” 
Pili has had an explosive first season for USC. Recruited as a three-time Gatorade Player of the Year from Anchorage, Alaska, Pili has been in the starting lineup since the season opener and has consistently delivered on both ends of the floor. Pili was honored as Pac-12 Freshman of the Week a staggering four times, the most in program history for the Trojans.
The true freshman averaged 16.2 points and 8.1 rebounds per game this season, as well as an even better 19.4 points per game in Pac-12 competition — the second most in the conference. She earned herself a spot on the All-Pac-12 Team as one of the top 10 players in one of the NCAA’s most competitive conferences for women’s basketball. 
“That’s another big accomplishment,” Pili said. “Because this is one of — the toughest conference in the country, so just seeing myself up there with all these big time players too is cool.”
Going into the Pac-12 Tournament, Pili is currently on a 14 game double-digit points streak, including performances against top opponents like No. 3 Oregon and No. 7 Stanford. She also has 11 double-doubles this season, the fourth most in the conference. 
Pili is averaging 50.9% from the field, which stands as the fifth best clip in the Pac-12. She has posted a 79.2% free-throw percentage and an 82.4% mark in conference play. Overall, she leads the entire Pac-12 freshman class in scoring, rebounding and free throw percentage. 
“We thought she might not even start [in the] beginning of the year, so she earned it,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “And she came in and she did everything she needed to do and turned out to be a pretty good player … so we’re very proud of what she did.”
Pili isn’t just one of the best players in the conference, though, as she’s emerged as one of the nation’s most productive players across the board. Pili finds herself in the top 100 in scoring, rebounding, free throws made, field goals made and field-goal percentage as well as the top 50 in double-doubles.
Pili has placed her name alongside Trojan greats like Lisa Leslie and Tina Thompson with the Freshman of the Year honor.
“That’s huge,” Pili said. “They’re some legendary players and just knowing that I’m on that path too is crazy.”
Pili, who obviously also earned a spot on the Pac-12 All-Freshman team, is joined by teammate senior forward Kayla Overbeck in the Pac-12 honors, with Overbeck receiving a Pac-12 All-Defensive Honorable Mention after averaging 1.7 steals in conference play and 5.8 rebounds per game overall.
Both players will begin postseason action Thursday at 6 p.m. in Las Vegas, Nev., where the No. 7-seeded Trojans will take on No. 10-seeded Colorado in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament.

A group of more than 30 students and faculty spend their Saturday mornings in makeshift classrooms at prisons across Southern California. The volunteers facilitate discussions on topics ranging from inmates’ opinions on Oscar-nominated films to theories behind the existence of the universe as part of Dornsife’s Prison Education Project. 
The program, which is part of a larger nonprofit composed of student volunteers, aims to expand educational opportunities for inmates by offering faculty-led classes across a variety of academic disciplines. The program began in 2011 at Cal Poly Pomona and has since expanded to 20 other universities, including USC Pitzer College and UCLA. 
The Prison Education Project emphasizes the importance of prison education in decreasing rates of recidivism, or a person’s relapse into criminal behavior. A 2013 Research and Development Corporation study revealed that participation in prison education programs reduces the risk of recidivism by 13%. 
Faculty co-directors Kate Levin and Nik De Dominic launched USC’s chapter in 2018 after students in the Levan Institute for the Humanities expressed interest in volunteering for the  program. Levin, who also serves as a faculty member in the Writing Program, said the experience of teaching inmates allows students to deconstruct their preconceptions of criminality and mass incarceration. 
“This is not service work primarily,” Levin said. “This is an educational experience for all involved, whether it’s the students who are incarcerated or the students who are traditionally enrolled.”
Faculty volunteers develop a curriculum for an eight-week course to teach a group of 15 to 20 inmates. Students act as teaching assistants for instructors, leading small group discussions and helping participants with the coursework.
The classes offered each semester vary depending on which professors participate in the program. Five courses are being taught this semester, including film studies and creative writing. 
“You’ve got undergraduate students and students who are incarcerated, learning materials together and working through materials together,” said De Dominic, who taught a creative writing class for the program last semester. “It’s much like your own coursework, but just in a very different kind of environment.”
USC’s teaching is based primarily at two medium-security facilities: the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco and the Custody to Community Transitional Reentry Program in Santa Fe Springs. 
Hadiya Culbreath, a sophomore majoring in health and human sciences, acts as one of the student directors of the project. She helps organize the weekly transportation to the facilities and manages the application process for students who want to volunteer. 
Culbreath said she joined the program to broaden her perspective on the criminal justice system and gain exposure to life experiences different from her own. 
“Being inside the prison facility and working alongside students that are incarcerated, there’s an entirely new outlook on life, an entirely new amalgamation of life experiences that you don’t get when speaking with USC peers,” Culbreath said. 
The program primarily offers humanities courses, but Culbreath hopes to increase the number of STEM classes offered in the future. 
“We don’t only want to do writing classes,” Culbreath said. “We want students to have access to different types of education while they are in the facilities.”
While faculty typically lead classes, co-director Colin Petersdorf, a senior majoring in biological sciences, taught a screenwriting class last semester at the California Rehabilitation Center. Petersdorf organized the class after a shortage of faculty volunteers from the School of Cinematic Arts. 
Petersdorf modeled the course after the “Introduction to Screenwriting” class at USC, which teaches students how to write a short film. Petersdorf took the course for his screenwriting minor in Fall 2017.
Technological devices are prohibited inside the facilities, so inmates wrote their screenplays in notebooks that Petersdorf transcribed using the screenwriting software Final Draft. He said participants wrote primarily about their lives as incarcerated people. 
“One man had a very touching piece about his first interaction with his family once he gets out,” Petersdorf said. 
The program also grants inmates the opportunity to grapple with the reasons for their incarceration through writing, Petersdorf said. 
“[The stories] were so moving, the students’ experiences with incarceration and with themselves and fighting those demons and trying to push forward — it was so, so incredibly powerful,” Petersdorf said. 
Aris Mangasarian, a senior majoring in psychology who started Underground Trojans, USC’s post-prison advocacy group, serves as the project’s outreach coordinator. Mangasarian, who spent time in prison as a young adult, emphasized the importance of expanding educational opportunities for incarcerated people. He said that education is a critical part of integrating former inmates into society.
“It’s in everyone’s best interest for us to move towards rehabilitation rather than a punitive approach,” Mangasarian said. 
Mangasarian has also spoken as a guest lecturer about prison education, or the “prison-to-college pipeline.” A play on the phrase “school-to-prison pipeline,” where students from marginalized communities become disproportionally incarcerated, the “prison-to-college pipeline” aims to funnel inmates into higher education after release. During the seminar at the facilities, he reflected on earning his GED in prison and his efforts toward continuing education. 
“It’s extremely rewarding, especially because I didn’t really have that [resource] when I was in their position,” Mangasarian said. “Granted, I was able to earn a GED … but I never really knew what I was going to do with that GED, and I never actually thought about college.” 
Levin said she sees the project as a powerful opportunity for students to develop a deeper understanding of the factors that lead to incarceration and to humanize the experiences of inmates. 
“It’s really important to me, to see [students] come away with a deeper, more meaningful, and frankly, more accurate understanding of how the world works,” Levin said. “I think having this experience can facilitate that.”

It took 18 months and 400 pages of notes and research, New York Times reporter Brian Rosenthall told the more than 30 students and faculty members who gathered in Wallis Annenberg Hall Monday to learn about his investigation into the New York taxi medallion scandal. At the event, moderated by journalism professor Mark Schoofs, Rosenthal walked attendees through his discovery that New York City earned $855 million from selling taxi medallions through predatory lending, which led eight taxi drivers to commit suicide. 
For months, Rosenthal investigated the connection between predatory lending, — the methods used by loan companies to deceive borrowers — and the suicides of taxi drivers. Rosenthal researched the reasons behind why people purchases taxi medallions for large sums, the falling value of these medallions and the series of suicides of taxi drivers tied to it. 
The story started when Rosenthal and four other reporters began gathering data on President Donald Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen’s ownership of 30 taxi medallions in relation to the Stormy Daniels incident, in which Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to conceal her affair with Trump.
This marked the beginning of Rosenthal’s investigation on the effects of improper lending on taxi drivers in New York City. 
Rosenthal came to understand the value of taxi medallion, which gave authorization for one to drive a taxi, had dropped from more than $1 million to $200,000. This led Rosenthal to question why people were purchasing these medallions when they cost a large sum. Over the course of his reporting, Rosenthal also learned about multiple suicides among cab drivers, which he later learned was the result of unethical lending by various loan companies. 
People thought that the medallions fell in value due to the rise of rideshare companies Uber and Lyft, Rosenthal said. However, his research led him to conclude that predatory lending was the real reason why cab drivers had bought the taxi medallions. The loan companies used dishonest lending practices to trick cab drivers into purchasing medallions, purposefully hiding the fact that they could not afford it. 
“What really had led to this huge bubble and the resulting devastation was the lending practices … for the loans given to cab drivers who are buying these endowments,” Rosenthal said.  
Schoofs explained that the loan contracts were arranged between private banks and underprivileged people, making Rosenthal’s research more difficult because private banks were not required to follow the Freedom of Information Act, which requires government agencies to share certain records when requested.
“This is a story, essentially, about predatory lending, about people who have something very valuable — medallions — and they lure unsophisticated people, often unable to speak English, often without a lawyer or financial advisory, into taking out a mammoth loan,” Schoofs said. 
Rosenthal used spreadsheets to organize interviews and statistical data such as auction results showing the amounts people bidding for the medallions and data for the medallions purchased outside of auctions. Rosenthal said he knew 5% of the purchase fee went to the city, which meant the city had made $855 million from selling the medallions.  
“Once you’re able to get all the persons at auctions, 100% [of their purchases] goes to the city, and [of] all the purchases made privately [outside of auctions], 5% goes to the city,” Rosenthal said. “We were able to get that number: $855 million, the amount that [New York] City made from selling medallions. [This amount] has never been reported before and is a very big number.”
Felicia Tapia, a graduate student studying journalism, had read Rosenthal’s New York Times article and watched “The Weekly’s” episode on Hulu about the investigation prior to attending the event. Tapia was drawn to the conversation because of the scale and significance of Rosenthal’s findings in the investigation. 
“[His finding] was very shocking because no one was really seeing what was happening,” Tapia said. “No one thinks [that there is a correlation between] cab drivers and $855 million being made off of their lives being ruined.” 
Jamia Pugh, a graduate student studying journalism, asked how Rosenthal stayed organized while sorting through information during the investigation.
In response, Rosenthal said he gathered information relating to the investigation in one Google Doc, which resulted in more than 400 pages. 
Rosenthal included interview notes, questions to ask, potential sources, key themes, to-do lists, news articles and clips in the Google Doc. One section of the document, which he called the “graveyard,” lists information about the investigation removed by the editor that he hopes to revive one day. 
“I do think there’s an underrated difficulty with investigative reporting, which is the tediousness of doing the same thing over and over again and feeling like it’s never-ending,” Rosenthal said. “I think to get through it, you have to celebrate the reporting victories along the way.”
Pugh asked how Rosenthal became comfortable with speaking to powerful figures, including city officials and lawyers. Rosenthal said he was never afraid of speaking to individuals with different levels of power. 
“I think I’ve been instilled with this thought that nobody’s better than I am, and who cares what their position is?” Rosenthal said. “We are two humans having a conversation.”
Pugh said the conversation was helpful for her own reporting because she is in the process of completing her capstone, a semester-long multimedia project for her master’s program, which includes traits of investigative reporting.
“I was aware of Brian’s accolades, so I came here to … learn about the investigative process more and incorporate that into my own reporting,” Pugh said. 
Rosenthal said he enjoyed the discovery process because the number of facts he unearthed increased his confidence in his findings. This confidence grew after The New York Times sent a letter to banks and those involved in the case stating that it planned to publish information regarding New York City’s profit from taxi medallions and the banks’ predatory lending practices. 
“Almost every bank mentioned, every agency mentioned responded,” Rosenthal said. “People want to respond to The New York Times. That just gave us a ton of confidence because we had the best argument against our story from everybody who was in the story, and it really allowed us to be very authoritative.”

USC Hotel has agreed to expand accommodations for guests with disabilities, the Department of Justice announced Monday. The settlement, entered last month, follows a 2018 investigation launched by the department into the hotel’s facilities when a guest who used a wheelchair sued the hotel in 2017 for failing to provide mobility accommodations, alleging that the one accessible room in the hotel was occupied the day of his planned stay. 
The agreement stipulates that the University will compensate the complainant $4,000 and implement changes to the hotel to align with federal regulations within 30 months of Feb. 21, the date the settlement took effect.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC said its participation in the settlement was elective. The agreement did not constitute an admission of responsibility from either party.
“The University is committed to accessibility for those with disabilities,” the statement read. “In keeping with this commitment, the University entered into a voluntary agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to improve its existing mechanisms for accessibility at the USC Hotel.”
The department found the hotel’s room options in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities. ADA regulations mandate that all hotels built after March 2012 offer a minimum number of accessible rooms and rooms with roll-in showers proportional to the size of the hotel. USC Hotel has 240 rooms and is required to offer 10 accessible rooms and three with wheelchair-accessible showers. At the time of the lawsuit, it offered one accessible room, which the University argued complied with federal policy because the building, opened in 1974 by the Hotels by Hilton chain, predated the ADA regulations. While the investigation did not find the hotel in violation of the act, the ADA requires businesses make reasonable accommodations to advance “full and equal enjoyment” of their commodities.
As part of the settlement agreement, USC Hotel will also install an accessible front counter and increase transparency in its room reservation system to inform prospective guests of the available accommodations.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that USC Hotel would have one year from the start of the settlement to enact the changes. The agreement gives the hotel 30 months to complete them. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

The Gould School of Law received a $2 million estate gift from educator and former Gould advisory board member Barbara Bice Monday. The donation will go to the student organization Public Interest Law Foundation to support their work with underserved communities. 
The foundation, established in 1988 by Gould students, provides funding for students in public interest law internships and assembles pro bono law clinic workshops to provide legal relief for vulnerable populations, including people experiencing homelessness and undocumented immigrants. The organization was founded under the administration of former Dean Scott Bice and has had seen behind-the-scenes support from Barbara in getting alumni donations to support student grants. 
In light of the endowment, the foundation will be renamed The Barbara F. Bice Public Interest Law Foundation. The current president of the foundation, Mirelle Raza, said the change was appropriate given the Bices’ work for the student body and Los Angeles community but also much-needed financial support for growing inquiry in the public interest field. 
“It’s a testament to the Bices’ 50 plus years of commitment to the law school,” Raza said. “But I think it also is just showing that there is a massive increase in the amount of students we’re seeing that are interested in public interest work. This year, we had two-thirds of the first-year class show up to the public interest law foundation meeting, and it’s very exciting for our thriving public interest community at Gould.”
In addition to providing support for internships, the organization works with community partners to strengthen student participation in public interest law, including the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles Skid Row Clinic, which works to protect the constitutional rights of those experiencing homelessness and low-income communities in the Skid Row area, and the Bet Tzedek Gender Marker and Name Change Clinic, which provides assistance with completing name-change and fee waiver applications. 
“This is the reality of any donation, but especially something as incredible as this endowment, because the endowment’s going to be protected for PILF students forever,” Raza said. “And there, it doesn’t just help USC students, it really will help the entire community. This is a decision and a donation that will have an effect on the L.A. legal community forever.”
