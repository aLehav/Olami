Beatrix LeBeau returns for another slime-shooting adventure in “Slime Rancher 2,” the long-awaited sequel to the highly acclaimed “Slime Rancher” developed by Monomi Park. This time, Beatrix finds herself on the mysterious Rainbow Island, a brand new land inhabited by plenty of delightful, wriggling slimes to collect. The goal is to help Beatrix discover new breeds of slimes, upgrade her conservatory and discover the hidden secrets of the island.
Although “Slime Rancher 2” released on the Xbox Game Pass, Epic Games Store and Steam Store on Sept. 22, the game is still considered early access, meaning it is still under development and new features will be added in future updates. With a price tag of $29.99, you may be wondering if it’s worth it to snag this sequel in its current state. 
“Slime Rancher 2” closely follows its predecessor — you play as Beatrix, a young woman who decides to become a rancher in the “Far, Far Range.” Beatrix’s rancher days haven’t ended after the first “Slime Rancher.” On Rainbow Island, her work moves from a little western farm to a giant, Victorian-style abandoned conservatory. The conservatory can be expanded onto the surrounding cliff and even move underground, building plenty of corrals, gardens and coops to house and feed your slimes.
Speaking of slimes — they’re everywhere! “Slime Rancher 2” brings back some familiar goopy faces, like the classic Pink Slime and the Phosphor Slime, a creature that flies and glows like a lightning bug. There are also some fresh new slimes to collect like the Cotton Slime, an adorable little blob with bunny ears, and the Flutter Slime, a delightfully orange slime with butterfly wings. All of the slimes have been revamped with gorgeous new models and textures that make them feel even oozier and bouncier than before. 
You catch and raise slimes to collect their “plorts,” little gems that slimes produce after eating (I’ll leave that process to your imagination…). You can sell plorts for Newbucks, the game’s fictional currency, which allow for the purchase of new corrals, coops and gardens to get more slimes and start the process all over again.
Collecting slimes is just one part of the fun. Rainbow Island is still somewhat small, but considering its early development, there’s lots to explore. The island is scattered with ancient ruins and strange little drones that hint at the complex history of its former inhabitants.
Regarding visuals, Rainbow Island certainly lives up to its name. The art style is absolutely stunning, with incredibly whimsical environments and candy-colored resources. Taking in the sights is an experience of its own, and certainly an exciting adventure for any “Slime Rancher” fans that want to see their favorite little critters wobble around in HD. 
The only downside to these beautiful graphics is the strain they take on your device. If you’re rocking a rinky-dink laptop setup, you’ll have to miss out on those dazzling ocean waves by either suffering endless frame lag or turning your resolution all the way down to even get the game running. Considering how much content “Slime Rancher 2” lacks in comparison to its predecessor, the visuals are its major selling point. So, without them, there’s little novelty in the standard slime-catching formula from the first game. 
“Slime Rancher 2” also features updated portraits and animations for the human characters — that’s right, there aren’t just slimes in this game! Beatrix dons a cute new outfit while her charming group of friends comes to life in adorable 2D animated character portraits. 
For fans of the original “Slime Rancher,” the cast remains the same and their stories continue to expand. For the unfamiliar, don’t worry. The story and character relationships are largely explained through dialogue and environmental cues. The narrative is subtle but engaging as you navigate communicating with far-away friends and establishing life on your own on the island.
The soundtrack completes the immersive, fanciful Rainbow Island experience. A lilting piano guides you from the main menu to the conservatory where the music picks up for a high-energy day of sucking slimes. The soundtrack is both elegant and eager, perfect as background music for both the game and real life.
While the mechanics are fairly standard for a first-person exploration game, it all feels smooth, and the implementation of an energy bar forces you to make thoughtful decisions about using up all of your juice at once. However, there aren’t any new mechanics to distinguish “Slime Rancher 2” from the first game. Beatrix still runs and jumps like before, and the “Vacpack,” a vacuum gun that Beatrix uses to suck up and shoot slimes, fruit and resources, doesn’t feature any remarkable additions.
One concern with the game being early access is that there’s currently no formal release date for updates or major story arcs. To soothe fears, the “Slime Rancher” team does make frequent updates to their website and has an active relationship with their fanbase via Discord server and social media. 
Overall, “Slime Rancher 2” is still a bit flimsy in terms of content, but all is forgiven considering its early access status. Passionate “Slime Rancher” fans will no doubt love the intricate and saturated new visuals of Rainbow Island and enjoy seeking out new slimes and lore. New players to the “Slime Rancher” franchise may fare better picking up the original — after all, the first “Slime Rancher” is content complete and $10 cheaper. 
“Slime Rancher 2” is already an incredible experience in early access and promises so much more. If you want to support the “Slime Rancher” developers while learning more about their fascinating and wiggly world, “Slime Rancher 2” is a great addition to your digital library.

As Lina González-Granados made her way through the pit to the podium at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion last Saturday, the audience buzzed with an especially welcoming and animated applause. Appointed the Resident Conductor of the LA Opera last September, the evening was her debut appearance with the company, an opportunity to demonstrate the energy and presence she hopes to bring to the orchestra.
Opening the opera, the timpani tapped out the beginning of the ominous Prelude, foreshadowing a night of intrigue, violence and destruction. Director Simon Stone’s daring staging waited behind the curtain, relocating the opera from its ordinary 17th century setting to the modern-day Rust Belt. By all means, the evening would pose a true artistic challenge, but for the Colombian Maestro, a personal history of trailblazing and excellence in performance has made her well prepared.
González-Granados hails from Cali, Colombia, a city with a vibrant and diverse musical culture. Though coming from a family of doctors, the conductor immersed herself in the art form, singing in choirs and playing piano. 
“[Music] started as a great opportunity to make friends and to be able to be in touch with something that was a little bit bigger than myself,” González-Granados said.
Moving to the United States in 2010, González-Granados furthered her studies at the New England Conservatory and Boston University, refining her conducting at the graduate level under mentors like Charles Peltz and Bramwell Tovey. For the young musician, the transition from Colombia to the U.S. was difficult. 
“Trying to find the right crew that you identify with, in a place that has little to no one looking like you — it’s just hard,” González-Granados said.
In spite of the many challenges, González-Granados has quickly risen to become one of the most prolific young conductors in the field. She held the position of Conducting Fellow at the Seattle Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra, and she currently holds the Solti Conducting Apprenticeship at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. She also regularly makes guest appearances with top orchestras, such as the New York Philharmonic, the San Francisco Symphony and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
Now, at the LA Opera, she is the first Latina to hold the position of Resident Conductor at a major U.S. opera company. In a field so often dominated by older white men, González-Granados brings diversity, a representation of what classical music can and should be. For her, securing more positions for underrepresented groups in the field is of utmost importance. 
“The job is not done until we all have a space on the table, and we are equal stakeholders in this conversation,” she said. 
Naturally, with the anticipation surrounding González-Granados’ debut, pressure was high to deliver a powerful performance — an expectation not just met, but far exceeded. From start to finish, the company delivered a colorful interpretation, drawing out even the subtlest of nuances in Gaetano Donizetti’s score. The dazzling performance was complemented with  thought-provoking staging.
Stone’s take on “Lucia di Lammermoor” weaves themes of modern life into his Rust Belt setting, such as substance abuse, financial decrepitude and gaslighting. Set designer Lizzie Clachan’s scenery clusters the stage with fragments of the town, including a motel, a pharmacy and the multi-level house. As the stage revolves, new settings appear, creating a convincing, if somewhat disorienting, environment.
In addition to the innovative scenery, a steadicam follows Lucia (Amanda Woodbury) in real time during the opera, projecting a close-up profile of her actions above the stage. This detail allows the production to incorporate new elements into her character, furthering our engagement with Lucia and emphasizing the helplessness of her situation. 
The attention is entirely warranted: Woodbury is completely enthralling. Her vocal performance is powerful, filling the hall with an ample supply of coloratura. Her “mad scene” in Act III, accompanied by the rarely employed glass harmonica in the orchestra, was truly captivating. Woodbury’s acting and singing enthralled the audience, and Lucia’s downfall became personal.
The cast surrounding Woodbury was equally up to the task. Arturo Chacón-Cruz provided a moving Edgardo, Alexander Birch Elliott’s Enrico was a pleasure to despise and Anthony Ciaramitaro left me wishing his role as Arturo was larger. The chorus, featured most heavily in Act II, made meaningful contributions, both in the singing and acting departments. 
Although the culmination of the plot in Lucia’s “mad scene” certainly was thrilling, The Sextet ending Act II may be the high point of the opera. With orchestra, chorus and cast all working in tandem, González-Granados managed to align the company into an adrenaline-pumping performance.  
In the hands of Lina González-Granados and the LA Opera, “Lucia di Lammermoor” becomes indispensable, with tremendous modern-day relevance. González-Granados succeeds in leading a performance that expresses profound emotion, enhancing the cathartic effect of the opera. 
“Sometimes, you have an inescapable joy or incredible sadness that you are not even able to put into words, and then opera can do it for you,” she said.
Remaining performances for “Lucia di Lammermoor” are on Sept. 28, Oct. 2 and Oct. 9, with Liv Redpath taking over in the titular role. Student Rush tickets are available for $25 on the day of each performance.

Yeghishe Kirakosyan, advisor to the Prime Minister of Armenia and Armenia’s representative at the European Court of Human Rights, spoke at the Gould School of Law Monday in a talk titled “How Small States Use International Law.” Kirakosyan discussed issues of sovereignty, justice and human rights against the backdrop of the recent conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Beginning Sept. 13, Azerbaijan launched unprovoked attacks on Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh territory, an area of historical tension between the two former Soviet republics. The territory, while internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan, has a majority Armenian ethnic population and has claimed independence since the late Soviet period. Though a ceasefire halted the recent attacks, many Armenian students at USC worry that future escalation of the conflict will lead to a full-scale war that will threaten Armenia’s long-term sovereignty and survival on the international stage.
“The major triggers for legal proceedings were the actions that broke many natural violations of human rights for crimes committed, and this has inevitably led Armenia to initiate proceedings,” Kirakosyan said.
Salpi Ghazarian, the director of USC’s Institute of Armenian Studies, introduced Kirakosyan to the audience. Kirakosyan studied at Yerevan State University, where he earned a master’s degree in law and jurisprudence and a Ph.D. in international law. Kirakosyan then went on to earn a second master’s degree in law and international legal studies from Georgetown University.
In his talk, Kirakosyan outlined the steps that Armenia has taken to initiate proceedings at the European Court of Human Rights and the International Court of Justice, the main court of the United Nations. The proceedings involved a request that Azerbaijan abide by certain conditions of humane treatment, particularly regarding their treatment of civilians.
“It is very difficult to escape the ethnic and racist policies which have created favorable conditions for crimes against humanity, which eventually can unfortunately lead to a genocide,” Kirakosyan said about international law.
Kirakosyan mentioned the example of the theme park Azerbaijan built after the 44-day war over the Nagorno-Karabakh region in 2020. The theme park depicted scenes from Azerbaijan’s victory over Armenia, and many Armenians decried it as racist. Kirakosyan said that Armenia requested that the park be shut down, and eventually Azerbaijan removed the mannequins and helmets used to depict Armenian soldiers.
“We saw behavioral change, and we saw a letter confirming it had been moved and we had the public commitment from the country that they would not display those articles again,” Kirakosyan said. “That’s a small behavioral change that largely I described.” 
Ghazarian said that the way Kirakosyan’s description of his work seemingly skips over humanitarian tragedy and focuses only on legal issues is indicative of his training as a jurist.
“He’s dispassionate and quite clinical in the way in which he is explaining, but that is what jurists have to do to stop man’s inhumanity to man,” she said.
Kirakosyan also highlighted the difficulties that Armenia faces on the international stage as a small state because of their limited resources. Furthermore, enforcement poses challenges, he said. 
“There is a huge effort on paper, but it’s really hard to enforce the actual conditions of interest,” Kirakosyan said. “You cannot undo the decades-long public racist policies in one day. That’s not possible. I understand that. It will take the next generation.”
Kirakosyan said that legal processes can be long and arduous. Though he has been working on these proceedings for years, it is easy to feel helpless in the face of continuing conflict, but he remains hopeful, he said.
“I do believe that, although I don’t see the immediate impact now, I know that in the long run, these legal proceedings are leading to very important qualifications … and you can use these qualifications in a political and different world,” he said.
Samuel Agustin, a freshman majoring in international relations, said the event contributed to opening his world view.
“I am just one mind,” he said. “And there’s always going to be a little bit of bias from where I come from. So just having other voices that contribute to my worldview really helped me to get an understanding for people around the world.”

A petition from the Middle Eastern and North African Student Association created in July calls for USC’s admission application to expand its racial and ethnic categories to include Middle Eastern and North African identifying students. 
“This lack of university racial/ethnic inclusion causes inaccurate depiction of data, including student body diversity demographics, funding, research, and equitable minority resources,” wrote Patricia Gerges, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering who created the petition, in the petition text. “In addition, the lack of accurate census contributes to the absence of culturally-specific and competent therapy appointments within the USC counseling and mental health services.”
In a MENASA meeting held Friday at the MENA Lounge, a cultural space for MENA students at USC, students discussed their efforts to be recognized by the University. The students are also calling for more funding and their own cultural center. 
“It’s been since 2019, and I feel like I’ve been talking and saying the same thing over and over,” said  Anthony Khoory, a senior majoring in sociology, and MENASA co-director. 
The only option for MENA students on forms such as the census, the USC application or standardized tests is the “white” racial and ethnic box, even though they don’t identify as white. As a result, students in the association feel that their unique racial, cultural and ethnic identity isn’t being recognized. 
MENA students present at Friday’s meeting said they felt the addition of a racial and ethnic category on the USC application would not only provide recognition for individual MENA students and their culture, but it would also provide crucial data on MENA students, such as in the case of health issues that are specific to MENA people. MENA people have an increased risk of cardiovascular and other diseases, according to the World Heart Federation.
Working with the University has often been difficult for MENASA, according to Nour Myra Geha, a sophomore majoring in international relations and MENASA co-director, even considering the progress that has been made.
“At that point, I wasn’t advocating. At that point, I was fighting,” Geha said of the group’s struggles to get recognition from the University. 
Khoory and Geha also spoke about MENASA’s experience with the Undergraduate Student Government at Friday’s meeting. After years of attempting to be admitted to the USG as its own assembly, MENASA was given a trial run this semester as an assembly, with funding of $5,000 from USG’s funding budget of more than $300,000. 
Getting to where they are now, Geha said, has been a struggle for MENASA. She detailed how difficult it has been to get information from the University on MENA students as a result of MENA students’ inability to identify as such when they apply to USC. 
“One thing is that USC, in the beginning before they gave us MENASA or before they gave us the MENA lounge, when we asked for numbers: How many Middle Eastern students are on campus? Allegedly, that’s what they say — they don’t have numbers, that they don’t know how many Middle Eastern students are on campus,” Geha said.
Getting recognition for MENA students would have a positive impact on the entire community,  but according to Razanne Mihtar, a freshman majoring in biochemistry, it would also mean a great deal to them as individuals. 
“When I call myself a person of color, I feel like an imposter because I’m not listed there — I’m either invalidated or I’m an imposter, and I feel like I’m not recognized as an individual,” Mihtar said.
At the end of the meeting, the students discussed their hopes for the future of MENASA and the MENA Lounge. Obtaining more funding and recognition, they agreed, would be critical to improving their programming and having their own cultural center. 
Geha and Khoory said they hope that progress can be made without having to continue to struggle. 
“We’ve been persisting for three years, and it’s a good start and we’re very happy with the start. But we don’t need to fight anymore. We don’t want to fight anymore,” Geha said. “At this point, we want to communicate, very reasonably: This space is too small for Middle Eastern students on campus.”

It has happened to all of us at one point or another. You walk what seems like miles in the cold only to find yourself at the doorstep of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. You get your knockoff Chipotle, grab a fork from Panda Express because Taco-Taco didn’t give you one and walk home. Once inside, you find your roommates sitting at the table laughing over a CAVA bowl with tongues dyed Dulce matcha green. They look at you, then at the brown sack, and ask, “Don’t you ever get sick of that?” You lie to yourself, say you like it and eat.
If this sounds familiar, I sympathize. College itself is already expensive enough, but add in the average lifestyle of a USC student, and your bank account is drained by week five (not personal experience or anything). Most of the time, it feels impossible to stick to a budget as a student. At the beginning of every semester, I sit down and add up all the money in my bank account and the little cash I have. I then divide it by the number of weeks in the semester (about 16.5) and that gives me my weekly budget. 
I start every semester pretty confident, thinking “How could I even spend all of this in a week?” I am quickly brought back to reality. Suddenly, the super fun party I “just have to go to” has a $7 entry fee, no meal in the USC Village is under $15, the Lyft to the concert I already shouldn’t have bought tickets to is $35 each way and don’t even get me started on the effect Handle and Duffl have had on my bank account. 
In a 2020 New York Times article, Ann Carrns explains how the “indirect costs” while living in college affect students who only really looked at tuition when budgeting. These indirect costs include food outside of a meal plan, off-campus housing, transportation and more. This heavily affects first-generation students and those who come from lower-income families who may be caught off guard because they weren’t expecting the costs, which can sometimes “make up half or more of the cost of attending some colleges.”
Although I could be better at following my budget, I do feel like I have a pretty good system set up. I make mine in a Google Sheet, with every type of purchase (like food, going out and groceries) being a different color. It’s pretty easy to figure out and a super fun activity to do every week. I can procrastinate doing my actual work by setting up something that needs to be done anyway. One thing that I have found super helpful is restarting my weekly budget on Fridays instead of Sundays. That way I can adjust my weekday plans based on how much I spent over the weekend, instead of the other way around. It allows me to still do everything I want on the weekends, and then eat the gross homemade meals on the weekdays instead. 
It can be pretty awkward and annoying to turn down plans with your friends because it doesn’t fit into your budget. Literally, as I’m writing this, my friends are Fryfting to Pot of Cha, which I can’t afford because I got a haircut over the weekend. It takes sacrifices to stay on top of and stick to a budget. It may give you extreme FOMO at the moment, but the reality is your real friends will find a way to hang out with you without having to spend a crazy amount of money. Sometimes, going to Trader Joe’s as a group, cooking together and having a movie night is just as fun as going off campus and watching your bank account slowly drop.
So, next time you or your friend walk in from the Tutor Campus Center or a dining hall, don’t ask them how they manage to eat the food — tell them you’re jealous of their ability to save money (because I know I am).

One of the fondest memories I have of living in the South is the distinct smell of rain. I could smell it from a mile away. I’m told it’s a skill that only Southerners seem to have. The rain brought life into our house. It called the frogs out of the makeshift pond we had in the front yard, watered the terraced rows of snow peas, corn, okra, squash and peppers we had in the backyard or rolled off the backs of the chickens that ventured out from the shack they nested in to look for the bugs that would come to the surface. The little creek that ran behind our house would swell but never got too high.
Rainy weather is just another fact of life in the South, but in certain circumstances, rain has turned into a death sentence — something hurricane and flood-prone areas of the region, like Louisiana and Florida, are all too familiar with. A couple short months ago, rain turned to reckless abandon in a place just a little further inland.
My last natural-diaster-related piece came out earlier this year when I wrote about the tornadoes in Mayfield, Kentucky. It is to Kentucky where I return, unfortunately. It’s been a couple of months since the eastern part of the Bluegrass State was struck by heavy rainfall that turned into floodwaters which eventually cascaded down those green mountains faster than a University of Georgia running back. The flood damaged or destroyed homes and communities — about 10,000 of them. It killed at least 37 people. 
I can already hear the sounds of some of y’all’s eyes rolling so far into the back of your heads (unless you’re a regular reader — which in that case, you’re my favorite people and you can ignore this callout). You’re probably wondering why you should care about some folks on the other side of the country. Or, maybe you’re the short-sighted Ben Shapiro-type and you’re thinking, “Why can’t these folks just pick up and move if they keep getting hit with stuff like this?” After all, we’re all dealing with this climate crisis, right? 
It matters because, in one small holler affected by the floods, a Kentucky community is fighting back in the courts. Blackhawk and its subsidiary, Pine Branch Mining, are being sued by residents of Breathitt County. The mining company operates a coal mine in this particularly poor community, already haunted by the dark cloud of local coal mines that have long been abandoned. The community is alleging that the company mismanaged their silt retention ponds, which exacerbated the flood and unleashed contaminated water as a side effect. 
It also matters because climate change will always impact people of color — as well as those stricken by poverty — most severely. It’ll hit those that can’t move because they can’t afford to, those whose only source of wealth may be in the home they can’t just up and take with them. 
While rich white billionaires are escaping to other planets through the hole that they and their corporate greed have drilled into the ozone layer, a conservative Supreme Court has gutted the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to combat climate change in their ruling on West Virginia v. EPA. Meanwhile, the U.S. government continues to twiddle its thumbs. The prospect of a greener, better world — and a greener, better South for all — remains bleak. But don’t let our current predicament depress you too much.
The fact that Breathitt County residents are already taking it upon themselves to pick a worthwhile and important fight with the company that has used and disposed of precious land, while also trying to pick up the pieces of what is left of their livelihoods in the aftermath of the flood, makes their example all the more inspiring. And let me remind you that you need not lose all hope in our legal system because people have taken on coal companies in the past and won. So keep that in mind if you ever want to take your local coal-rolling, pollution-causing business to court.
And another thing: Horrible political figures might represent Kentucky and states like it, but don’t you dare let their presence dissuade you from doing something for the folks here. Don’t let any ill-formed thought tell you to brush this off as something Kentuckians “deserved” for giving the nation Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul. Come hell or high water, we’re going to pay the price for ignoring those most impacted by climate change if we choose to let electoral maps dictate where our empathy goes.

Sometimes, after the official end of practice, you can catch USC’s newest transfer quarterback emerging from the practice field late after getting in extra work with Head Coach Lincoln Riley. 
And no, the newest QB transfer is not the Beats by Dre-sponsored, number 13 wearing, Heisman candidate Caleb Williams. 
In a less heralded but important move, Lincoln Riley recruited another transfer quarterback to add to his ranks behind Williams. 
Standing at 6-foot-2, weighing 210 pounds and wearing number 17, from Pleasant Grove, Utah, it’s sophomore QB Jake Jensen, who transferred from, well…how and why Jensen ended up here is a complex story, albeit an incredible one. 
“I think it worked out the way it’s supposed to be,” Jensen said. 
It definitely worked out the best for the team. 
“Jake’s been awesome. Cool story, kind of just stumbled upon him,” Riley said. “We’re thrilled he came aboard.” 
When he emerges from under the radar, his story that Coach Riley mentioned is one that everyone will be talking about. 
Coming out of Pleasant Grove High school, Jensen was a three-year starter who was labeled a pro-style QB prospect, but received no stars and thus, zero scholarship offers. 
He committed to BYU as a preferred walk-on in 2019, but didn’t immediately show up to school that fall. Instead, he headed to Argentina. 
Vying for a shot to play quarterback at a major American university and then heading across the world from said university seems like a bold move, but Jensen had another important priority besides football. 
He was serving on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Argentina and planned to stay there a whole year before the coronavirus pandemic cut the mission short.
He finally made it to BYU in the spring of 2021, but he’d leave before ever playing a snap, transferring to Contra Costa Junior College. 
From an outsider’s perspective, this may seem bizarre. Jensen essentially left familiar territory to venture into the unfamiliar. He went from BYU, which he called his dream school in a tweet in 2019 and has a big football program sponsored by his church, to a junior college in California. It’s a bold move not many would make. 
But, it was a move that helped Jensen greatly. He threw 22 touchdowns and only 9 interceptions in 10 games at Contra Costa. He only got better as the season went on, putting up his best numbers in the season finale. In a 28-19 win over Foothill JC, Jensen passed for 339 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. 
Now, schools were on notice. He quickly received scholarship offers from UC Berkeley, UNLV and New Mexico. 
He committed to New Mexico and was set to move halfway across the country again — until, as he did in the transfer portal all offseason, Lincoln Riley swooped in. After a visit to USC, Jensen quickly decided to become a Trojan instead of a Lobo.  
“Coach Riley’s obviously got a great history with quarterbacks, and it’s a quarterback’s dream to be playing under him,” Jensen said. 
The defense has appreciated the challenge of playing against him in practice as well. 
“It’s been great having him. We go against him every day…he’s always making good throws, he’s a good player and he’s a good guy too,” said freshman cornerback Ceyair Wright, who made an interception in USC’s win against Oregon State on Saturday. 
In addition to his athletic ability though, Jensen’s character also caught Riley’s attention from the start. 
“We were impressed with Jake’s film, and just as, if not more, impressed with him [as a] person,” Riley said. 
Jensen has brought resilience that could only have been built up during his journey to USC, a trait that has especially amazed his Head Coach. 
“Really have appreciated his toughness,” Riley said. “He’s a tough kid, and I think at that position that’s a very, very underrated quality.”
Jensen has also been extremely adept to the mental aspect of learning Riley’s offense.  
“He’s a fast learner, which has been huge, especially coming in late like he did. He’s very mature, all in, very in tune mentally,” Riley said. 
Jensen has needed every bit of his toughness and mental edge to make it to USC through the wild path he’s taken to get here. But now, Jensen finds himself finally somewhat settled. He’s on scholarship, he’s married, he’s made close friends like the other QBs and tight end Lake McRee and he loves being at USC.“I think I’ve been able to see a lot of different styles of coaching, been able to see different teams, different sides of the game, and I think it’s made me appreciate being here more,” Jensen said. “I love being here, I appreciate the opportunity I have, and I think that my path and where I’ve been has helped with that.” 
But, don’t mistake Jensen being settled for being satisfied. He continues to put in the work to be the best quarterback he can be. 
With a hardworking attitude and three years of eligibility left plus a redshirt year, Jensen believes he can have a real impact on this program. 
“We’ve got a lot of transfers here and we are all here for a reason,” Jensen said. 
Keep your eyes on him, because his Trojan career has the potential to be the best chapter of his amazing story. 
“He’s a guy I’m confident that when he gets his chance, he will be able to shine,” Riley said.

At the beginning of the season, nearly everyone predicted that the Pac-12 would fade into oblivion as all of its top teams prepared to leave. But after week four, the once legendary conference has quelled these concerns and is showing signs of life. 
For the first time in over five years, the Pac-12 looks like a power five conference. The conference has been plagued with mediocrity, with USC, Oregon, or more recently, Utah, running the table. Now, the Pac-12 has four teams in the top 15, more than any other conference besides the SEC.
Three of these teams, Washington, Utah and USC, could realistically make the college football playoffs. Oregon is a very talented team, but the committee will not be able to see past their 49-3 loss at Georgia. Even if they win out, the prevailing argument will be that a team that suffers a loss of that magnitude does not deserve to be among the four best teams in college football. 
The Washington Huskies have produced their best start to a season since 2017. New offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb has injected energy into the offense with an unpredictable and high-paced playbook. The Huskies produced over 500 yards of offense in the first three games. 
One of the Huskies’ most significant perceived weaknesses is their defense, particularly the secondary. However, after limiting a skilled Stanford offense, many of these concerns have been put to bed. Washington is gaining momentum heading into a huge Friday night game at UCLA. 
USC won a nail-biter at Oregon State Saturday night. Some critics bashed the Trojans’ performance, arguing that a top ten team should not barely beat Oregon State. Others who paid close attention to the game noticed a unique persistence developing within the Trojan defense that should concern Trojan opponents. 
Playoff programs find ways to win games in unique ways. The biggest question mark about USC heading into week 4 was their defense, especially after looking completely at times against Fresno State and especially Stanford. 
Before this week, the Trojans have won largely due to their offense. Caleb Williams and Jordan Addison have demolished opposing defenses, scoring in piles. Saturday, Williams was off and the defense stepped up, limiting the Beavers to 14 points. In contrast, they scored 68 points last week and over 30 in their other two games. 
Senior OL Brett Neilon moving four Oregon State players to push Caleb Williams to a first down in what has already been coined the “Neilson Nudge” is indicative of the Trojans’ gritty approach. USC fought for every yard all game, and could not have looked more different than their lethargic state under Clay Helton.  
The USC defense makes up for their lack of superstar talent with a level of tenacity that makes it extremely difficult for opposing teams to score on a consistent basis. USC is tied for first in the nation in turnovers, while also remaining the only team in the nation that has not committed a turnover themselves. 
After proving they are a complete team on both sides of the ball, USC deserves their No. 6 ranking, assuming the Trojan offensive performance was a fluke. 
Washington and USC both have a new head coach and new starting quarterbacks this season, suggesting both these teams have only begun to show their true potential. 
In stark contrast, Kyle Whittingham has held the head coach position at Utah since 2004. After building the program for a few years, the Utes want to win now. 
Junior quarterback Cameron Rising is a dark horse for a Heisman, and will likely enter the NFL draft after this season. 
Utah also cannot afford to lose again after Florida barely defeated them in the Swamp in the season opener. The USC vs. Utah Matchup on Oct. 15 will likely spoil one of these teams’ playoff aspirations. 
Beyond these three teams, the Pac-12 also has many notable teams that don’t quite make the cut as a potential playoff contender but have made this season of in-conference play very entertaining.
UCLA is undefeated, which is impressive on paper, but a closer look at their schedule reveals they still have not been tested by a legitimate team. They will have the opportunity to prove themselves against Washington Friday night in what should be one of the most riveting games of the week.
WSU, OSU and Cal are all one-loss teams that missed the first list by the skin of their teeth. OSU gave the Trojans a run for their money this weekend, while WSU did the same to Oregon. 
The result of this environment is a Pac-12 with very few off weeks in comparison to past seasons. USC cannot afford to drop any more games than one if they want to make a case to the playoff committee, and the latter half of their schedule is loaded with tough matchups. 
In any event, the Pac-12 has looked like an entirely new conference this season, reloaded with new talent and heightened watchability. The timing is strange, given USC and UCLA’s imminent departure, but entertaining nonetheless.
