Set against a dimming pink sunset, 15 dancers from the USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance showed off their moves while clothed in sequins to match the Los Angeles skyline. 
The students, all dance majors, performed at Griffith Observatory in January before an audience of cameras while filming a 60-second Discover Los Angeles commercial.
The ad premiered on Super Bowl Sunday and aired during the Grammy Awards. Later this month, it will run globally in Mexico and the United Kingdom and later in the year in other countries such as Australia and China. 
Many dancers said they benefited greatly from the experience because they were directly placed in the show business world of lights, camera and action. 
“The experience was really eye-opening, and my perception of what it’s like to do commercial work really shifted,” sophomore Brianna Mims said to USC News. “I never understood the amount of work that goes into the one-minute commercials I see on TV until this experience.”
The dancers said that the experience was different from many other dancing opportunities. Rather than performing on stage, they were performing for the camera — but sophomore Mark Daftari said that the two were actually more similar than most people think. 
“Dancing for the camera makes you feel like you’re dancing on stage because there is an audience, but it’s technically the camera,” Daftari said. 
Daftari also said that the camera adds a new component for the dancers; they are able to develop a new ability for transferring performance elements from stage to screen. He said he gained new insight about how to avoid losing the dancers’ stage presence while in front of the camera.
“When dancing on stage, you have to make sure you are expansive and have elongating movements just so everyone can see you,” Daftari said. “While dancing on camera, you have to be more focused on being very detailed because the close-up shots are more revealing of your technique and emotions. Of course these are things to be wary of while on stage as well, but a camera adds an intimacy factor to you and the audience when it’s so close by.” 
Kaufman Vice Dean Jodie Gates designed the choreography for the commercial. According to Gates, the movement was based in contemporary and lyrical styles of dance. 
“The shoot at Griffith Observatory was massive and sophisticated,” Gates said to USC News. “The lighting equipment, drones and extensive staff made for an extraordinary experience.”
Sophomore Juan Miguel Posada worked as Gates’ assistant, helping her choreograph and work out the logistics of the commercial. As the choreographer’s assistant, Posada said he was able to see a different side of the commercial world. He helped organize rehearsals, contact agents, perfect the dancers’ technique and design the costumes. 
“It was a good experience of what it’s like to work in the show business world,” Posada said. “It serves as a sneak peek to what the dancers want to be doing in their future careers. I got to see the behind-the-scenes of what the commercial world is like and so much goes into it to making it happen.”

 A non-USC male drove his vehicle onto campus and crashed into a bench at Hahn Plaza just before 5 p.m. on Monday, causing minor damage to his car and other property.
The accident occurred when the driver made a U-turn and ran over a backpack near the fountain at Hahn Plaza, according to the Department of Public Safety. No injuries to the driver or any pedestrians were reported as a result of the incident.
According to DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle, the man appeared to be disoriented and confused while driving and was unaware of his location at the time of the crash. DPS officers who responded to the situation contacted the fire department and paramedics. Paramedics transported the driver to a local hospital for treatment of possible medical issues or other complications that were not directly related to the crash.
The Los Angeles Police Department impounded the car following the accident, storing it temporarily at their facilities until the driver is able to reclaim it.
Carlisle said that there are currently no ongoing cleanup efforts at the scene of the crash because all damage to property was minor.

Every week, native English and Chinese speakers gather at Kaprielian Hall to practice their language skills with each other. This program, known as the Chinese English Language Exchange allows students not just to improve their speech but to also get a feel for the American and Chinese cultures and customs. 
“We promote cross-cultural awareness as well as practicing language. Language practice is a major component, but the coolest part is the cultural exchange,” said Jonathan Krabbenschmidt, the public relations chair of CELE. “It’s really valuable for us as language learners to learn the different holidays and their significance and hear presentations from students being given in Chinese and English. It helps get everyone out of their comfort zone.” 
The program started two years ago, with just a few students looking to improve their speaking skills. Under several Chinese professors, they decided to get a group together, comprised of both Chinese and English native speakers, to help take advantage of the other’s expertise. 
“It’s difficult to get a grasp on a language if you don’t practice speaking outside of the class,” Krabbenschmidt said. “It expanded to include not just language practice, but also sharing each other’s cultures, and that’s where the exchange part began.” 
As a relatively new organization on campus, CELE has encountered some difficulty in attracting an equal amount of speakers for both languages. Native English speakers learning Chinese, were especially in short supply. 
“There’s more Chinese language speakers at the meetings than language learners, and I think it’s really important that there’s an equal balance,” Krabbenschmidt said. “There’s not as many Chinese language learners as, say, Spanish or French, so it’s a little hard to track more English speakers. It doesn’t matter what your Chinese speaking skills are, we’re always looking for more heads.” 
Some students could also request to be paired up one on one, in order to cultivate a more intimate and personalized experience. These pairings often develop into genuine friendships, with the two spending time together outside of meetings getting to know each other better. 
“I met with a girl, Kathy, once a week, and we talked for an hour in both English and Chinese,” said Turner Wong, a senior majoring in international relations. “We didn’t talk about school stuff. We talked about our friends, our families, what was happening in our lives, and we eventually ended up becoming good friends.”
Wong espoused the benefits of speaking with someone who could help her learn Chinese. Her familiarity with the area surrounding USC was also a plus, as she was also happy to help her partner navigate Los Angeles.
“I think the concept of talking with someone who is native is very helpful, and it’s always good to learn and meet people from other cultures,” Wong said. “And I could help her if she wanted to go to the beach, or she wanted to know where the good food places were, she would come to me.” 
Since its inception two years ago, CELE has grown exponentially and is poised to become even larger in the upcoming years. Now officially USC-affiliated and receiving university funding, CELE now has the resources to put on more enriching events for its members. 
“It’s a little sad for me to be leaving at this turning point, going from a small grassroots language practice club to a full USC-affiliated club where membership is growing,” Krabbenschmidt said. “My hopes would be for it to grow into something more prominent on campus, something that people know about and know anyone is welcome to go to.”
Congrats to all who participate in this important language/culture program because being being an international student is difficult. Assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   An award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.    
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Good luck to all at USC or wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who have the loudest voice!

Nobel laureate Vernon Smith, commenting on society’s most basic structural elements, said that “the rules of property and modern conventions have ancient origins.” Commerce has existed since prehistoric times, and even primitive tribes increased their economic wealth through methods like specialization.
Smith, a professor of economics and law at Chapman University and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, gave a lecture to students and faculty on Monday at the University Club. He received his Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University and has taught at several prominent universities, including Stanford University, Brown University and California Institute of Technology.
Smith’s discussion centered on Adam Smith’s theory of moral sentiments as an explanation for various game theory models that have confounded economists since the 1990s. Hosted by the USC Dornsife Institute for New Economic Thinking, the talk is the first in this semester’s series.
Smith began by exploring the underpinnings of the Enlightenment, noting that prominent economist Adam Smith may have been profoundly influenced by Isaac Newton’s theories.
“I like to think of people in the Scottish Enlightenment as applying Newtonian thinking to social, political and economic life,” Smith said, relating Adam Smith’s theory of the “invisible hand” to Newton’s theory of the invisible force of gravity.
“There are all kinds of order out there in our social, political and economic life. Where does this order come from?” Smith said. “Part of it is that we’re influenced by things that we’re not aware of. We learn things without even realizing we are.”
He then explored several fundamental ideas behind the theory of moral sentiment, including that humans may not be completely rational actors and are instead prone to altruistic behavior. Smith showed this by examining the results of his tests on game theory.
Smith’s lecture ultimately explained an alternative way of viewing economic phenomena, saying that modern economists tend to explain the results of their studies by superficially altering predictive economic functions. His theory, however, harkens back to Adam Smith’s 18th century thesis, prescribing a deeper cause as the root of our capacity for altruistic actions.
Viren Rupani, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said that attending these events gives him the opportunity to hear about cutting-edge economic theories.
“I’ve always been really fascinated by economics,” Rupani said. “Usually in class you get to learn about classical textbook theories, but when you come to lectures like these you get to see what new developments are happening in the field and learn new insights.”
Rupani also commented on how basic structures of human interaction can be applied to economics through Smith’s theory.
“I found the synthesis between Adam Smith’s theory of moral sentiment and the basis for human interaction to be very interesting in how they potentially relate to the realm of economics,” Rupani said. “You can synthesize these fields and see how they come together to provide a much more comprehensive view of how human interaction takes place in the marketplace.”
I want to correct an error in this otherwise excellent report on om Lecture. Adam Smith’s model was not about people being “altruistic”.  Rather, in our maturation, we learn to respect the feelings of others and take this into account in our social world. As Adam Smith put it, we humble the arrogance of our self-iterest to bring it down to what others will go along with.  We are entirely self-interested, but control its expression in the interests of living in harmony with our neighbors. This requires self-control, and we sometimes fail in that virtue.

You should never go into a first date with any expectations, but it is hard not to let the possibilities of who you will meet overwhelm you on a blind date. Without knowing someone’s interests or intentions or appearance, you begin to imagine who they are even before you get there — resulting in some cloudy boy-figure you hold in your mind as you shower and put on make-up. Will he be talkative? Kind? Out of your league? 
As this date was for an article we both had to write, I was worried going in that the boy I met would have little interest in me, and I would pick up a newspaper two days later to find all the awkward impressions I must have given off confirmed in his own writing.
In that regard, then, our date far exceeded my expectations. I arrived at the Ground Zero Performance Café with my heart rate quickening, aided only by my editor’s reassurances that my date was “very woke” and we would have “a stimulating conversation.” 
But, I wondered as I waited: Why did I follow through with this assignment? Years of my heart being tugged backward and forward have resulted in a knot of insecurity I have yet to purge from my chest. A stimulating conversation should have been all I wanted.
Even still, I could feel a familiar hope rising inside of me as I leaned against a black column by the Ground Zero entrance, a hope that I wanted to shove down. However, I wasn’t waiting for long — he soon walked through the door, and there was a small moment where I recognized him before he recognized me (I was told to look for, in his words, a “tall, skinny, awkward white guy”), but he didn’t look very awkward to me. I immediately felt overdressed compared to what he was wearing (a simple USC sweatshirt), and I felt stupid for the amount of time I had spent painting on eyeliner in the mirror while listening to Radical Face’s music.
And yet as we both ordered tea, and as we began to talk about politics and dining halls and journalism, I felt a confidence grow inside me. He was that easy to talk to, and he was charming. Our date was less about analyzing someone for all the physical signs of interest and more about parsing through all the issues we both cared about. We talked about Saturday Night Live and which journalists we loved and indie pop. We lamented the state of the executive branch and fangirled over different political drama shows. We talked about our futures: He wants to go into government, and I want to go into film. 
We spent an hour at Ground Zero before it closed, but afterward he suggested we take a walk around campus. Taking our date into public was a different feeling, and it was hard not to sense some of the closeness we had built up over warm tea dissipate into the cool night air. But still, the walk felt shorter than it really was, cutting past the fountain in front of Doheny Memorial Library and past the Thornton School of Music.
I showed him the School of Cinematic Arts, and we circled back so he could show me the building where he takes class. At the end of our walk we lingered, asking each other more questions. And then, after an hour and a half of conversation, it was over. We both had hours of homework to do and already the rest of the night was pressing against our backs.
It won’t be the last time we talk — we’re both politically involved and promised to keep in touch to link our organizations. But when I suggested we meet up for another conversation, I noticed he hesitated, and I could feel my mind already racing to familiar conclusions. 
He doesn’t find you interesting. He didn’t expect you to say that. He’s just nervous. But as he smiled down at me, some calm inexplicably settled over my shoulders. I breathed again. And as we parted ways, I thought to myself, we had a stimulating conversation. What more can I possibly ask?
————————
I was ready to crack open my administrative ethics textbook and spend the next few hours wallowing in the morality of bureaucrats when I got the call to come into the Daily Trojan office.
In the midst of a Wi-Fi drought, I fled to the newsroom so I could work more on my upcoming article. I was working quietly with my editor when I heard someone asking if someone could go on a blind date and write a story on it. While all the men in the office opted out one by one, there I sat, waiting for the inevitable: “What are you doing tonight?” 
After thinking for a few moments, I decided to say no to the paper I needed to write and the midterm I needed to study for and yes to a night of risk.
Petrified of not knowing how things would go, much less even knowing who to look for when I arrived, I approached the Ground Zero Performance Café with some apprehension. Luckily, my date was there waiting by the front, saving me the embarrassment of walking up to random patrons to ask whether or not they were here for the Daily Trojan blind date.
While waiting for our chai teas, I realized we had a lot in common. For one, we both had received our fair share of unsavory comments on our past Daily Trojan articles. More than that, we had a silent but mutual agreement that we wouldn’t let the unconventional circumstances get in the way of enjoying the evening.
Conventional wisdom tells us to steer clear from politics at the dinner table, and especially on blind dates — but I couldn’t resist revealing the political nerd inside of me. Normally politics is divisive, but for us, venting about everything from the merits of Melissa McCarthy as Sean Spicer to the Sad! state of the President’s Twitter account helped us immediately form a bond. With a solid foundation in our shared liberal beliefs, the conversation veered to anything from majors to movies and from backgrounds to the basic joy that watching La La Land  brings.
After an hour of easy conversation, the opportunity arose to address the elephant in the room. After sharing a laugh over the bizarre turn of events that brought us together that night, we spent the rest of the evening simply getting to know each other better without the worries of expectations or pressure.
A night marketed as a blind date and an opportunity to write about something other than politics for once turned out to be a chance to form a genuine connection with someone over common interests  — something to always be valued. Sometimes we become so fixated on what dates mean that we lose sight of the importance of connecting with someone and having meaningful conversation.
So why did I say yes? Because I know I was tempted to say no. Life, and also love, is about risks, and I knew that I needed to be comfortable with the uncomfortable if I ever wanted to have the confidence to chart my own course free from fear and worry.
As someone who normally dreads spontaneity and uncertainty, a blind date was the perfect way to shake me from me from my own self-inhibition. So I in turn encourage you to say yes. Don’t worry about expectations or circumstances  — take a leap of faith. Regardless of what happens, you won’t regret it.

Josh had a weekly radio show and was part of a touring improv troupe. I had his name saved in my phone with the octopus emoji. 
When I think of him, I often picture him telling me he knew how to do a gun trick straight out of an old Western film. I cringed at first at this dorky boy, whose bedroom I’d wound up in once again, but he pulled out two prop guns from a film shoot and proceeded to spin them dexterously and point them straight at me.
I fell on the bed laughing as he kissed me hard. Something pleased me about this tall, messy-haired boy joking about his gun skills in an exaggerated accent. He went to American University and was a respite from the policy world I was part of during my time in Washington, D.C. He also turned 21 on Feb. 14. And I hadn’t been single on Valentine’s Day since I was 16.
I’m writing this column not in celebration of the gray zone, but in acknowledgment of it. The common Valentine’s Day image is a dichotomy between sad, single people and happy couples. Most young people know it isn’t so black and white — so many of us are also somewhere in the middle. Last year, those people were Josh and me. 
On Valentine’s Day morning, I thought that 2016 was the year that would break my cycle of romantically committed but nonetheless boring Valentine’s Days. The Hallmark cards were getting to me and the culture of “don’t catch feelings” was keeping me at an arm’s distance from Josh, whom I had met about three weeks before. 
Josh and I didn’t talk about our pasts much. We talked about our everyday stresses and our friends and family, but often ended our conversations doing strange things or Saturday Night Live impersonations. He mentioned once that he transferred colleges after following an ex-girlfriend out to California, only for her to leave him. As for what he knew about me, he followed me on Instagram, so I assumed he knew I survived cancer. His pick-up line on Tinder was terrible, but it made me laugh.
It was all a bit weird. But for the first guy since my serious ex-boyfriend, I was quite all right.
On Valentine’s Day morning, I texted my friend who was also in a situation that had not yet DTRed (defined the relationship). As our hangovers from Feb. 13 faded away, we met each other at the local CVS Pharmacy. Pitying ourselves, we threw caution to the wind, ignored that the prices would be slashed in half in 24 hours and bought all the candy we could think of. 
Dahlia bought multiple boxes of Red Vines, and I stocked up on Cadbury, Hershey’s Cookies ‘n’ Creme candy bars, Haribo Happy Cola gummi candies and Reese’s. We sat grinning and giggling over the study table in my apartment building, quietly anxious about boys but writing essays and popping chocolates in our mouths as if we were the ones to invent the single-ladies-on-Valentine’s-Day stereotype. 
Occasionally, Josh would send me text updates about his family birthday situation. He invited me for drinks after dinner. “I guess I have a Valentine’s date?” I said to Dahlia. 
He picked me up and drove me to a quiet bar with a theme somewhere between the Antebellum and Prohibition periods. It was his first legal drink, and neither of us had acknowledged that he’d invited me — whatever I was to him — to this relatively memorable occasion. Even if he was just looking for company, that was OK with me. 
It was Valentine’s Day, after all. I got buzzed on a strong gin and rosemary cocktail as our knees touched under the table. I wished him a happy birthday in a soft voice. It started to snow outside.
As we drove home, listening to ’80s ballads and ’90s R&B, something about the day and the snow and the rosemary gin started to remove me from my inhibitions. I stopped caring for a couple hours about whether I was “catching feelings” or not.
He offered me a birthday cupcake when we got to his apartment and I threw my anxieties aside, taking the one with a chocolate chip cookie on top. I giggled because he ate two and for a couple of hours we watched YouTube videos of raccoons and some It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia together.
I started to get sleepy, and as we quieted down, somewhere around midnight, he whispered in my ear, “Happy Valentine’s Day.” 
Josh and I never became anything more. But for that day we were able to take away the pressure of both Hallmark romance and casual college dating culture. So I smiled and said it back. 
“Happy Valentine’s Day, Josh.”

Ask Vincent Ho and Kami Nagami what defines their relationship, and they’ll find many ways to answer.
She’ll say he’s kind, generous and understanding beyond description. He’ll say that she’s his rock, his pillar of support. They’ll tell you about annual traditions and their plans to travel the world together.
But mostly, when they think of each other, of their years spent together, one place comes to mind — USC.
Kami met Vincent at the end of her first week on campus. It was her first visit to a USC fraternity — Sigma Phi Delta, his house. He greeted her with the two words most likely to garner immediate interest from a girl at her first frat party — “Jello shot?”
It wasn’t quite love at first sight. But it was close enough. From that day forward, Vincent filled in the details of Kami’s time at USC.
As it turned out, they’d grown up brushing the corners of each other’s lives. They came from the same suburbs of Los Angeles, their parents frequenting the same stores for years. Somehow, they’d never crashed into each other until now, at a Welcome Week party in her freshman year and his last year of his progressive engineering degree.
If they tried to explain what happened next, it would add up to a sum of predictable cliches. What mattered most was that they worked in the most uncomplicated of ways.
There was never a resounding moment where either one of them suddenly realized that this would never end. Maybe there should’ve been, Kami said. But instead they fell into each other, slowly building a life together with an ease that never went away.
Vincent was the son of immigrants who never carved out the practices of American holidays, so Kami filled each year with new traditions. She hid eggs for him to find at Easter, forced him to watch all of her favorite Halloween movies and planned a trip to Disneyland each December to see the Christmas lights.
Eight years later, their lives are still patterned around these little rituals.
He proposed in December 2015, a little over seven years after they first met in that crowded frat house. At first, he had grandiose ideas — a drive to the beach for a sunset proposal, maybe. But Vincent knew himself too well. He knew that he was terrible at keeping secrets, especially from Kami, and that his face would give it all away in a heartbeat.
So instead, he took her back to the place where it all started.
He told Kami that there was a Christmas party on campus with some of his old friends. They walked hand-in-hand through campus, which was starkly empty in the week after finals commenced and winter break began.
Vincent’s phone wouldn’t stop vibrating, and despite his nerves, he took a second to glance at it. His screen was filled with texts from the photographer he’d hired to capture the moment — she was warning him that a wedding photo shoot had already beaten him to their location.
He went for it anyways. He walked Kami to Tommy Trojan, the most recognizable symbol of USC, and as they closed in on the statue, the wedding party took a break and moved over to rest by Traveler. This was his shot.
When Vincent dropped on one knee, Kami thought he was stopping to tie his shoe. It took her a moment to realize that he was pulling out a ring, and another to cover her face in surprise. A year later, she can hardly remember the words he used to ask her to spend the rest of their lives together.
“I think I blacked out through it,” she laughed.
He didn’t mind — she said yes, and that’s all that really matters.
Afterward there was a party with friends and family, a wedding, a honeymoon, matching rings and a home together. This isn’t the type of story that has a happy ending, because even after eight years together, the couple is still at their beginning.
“It’s everything you hope of when you think about how you want your life to go,” Vincent said. “It’s been the easiest and the best part of my life.”
They’re both back on campus now, in their respective first and last years of graduate school. It’s been a nostalgic year, as if they’re caught up again in all the firsts of their time together. It’s also their last year before the rest of their lives, and they’re both enjoying soaking in the twilight of their college years together.
There’s some certainty to their future — Vincent just accepted a job with PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Kami will take another year to finish her graduate degree. After that, they might go abroad for Vincent’s new position, take time to travel like they’ve always talked about.
But beyond that, they haven’t laid concrete plans. And as far as Vincent and Kami are concerned, they don’t really need them.
“I don’t know what the future holds, but he’s the constant,” Kami said. “This is the most important thing we have, and no matter what, that’s always going to be true.”

Jake Casino | Daily Trojan
The No. 2 USC women’s water polo team (14-0) took care of business in La Jolla over the weekend, notching four solid wins to take home the 2017 Triton Invitational crown and remain undefeated on the season.
The tournament was hosted by UC San Diego and featured 16 teams, 13 of which were ranked in the CWPA Top 25. To open up group play on Saturday, USC took on the Santa Clara Broncos in an early morning tilt. The Trojans ran out to a 10-2 advantage at the half thanks to some balanced scoring and kept the opposition scoreless the rest of the game to secure the 18-2 victory. 
Three freshmen led the way as utility Maud Megens notched a career-high five goals, while drivers Denise Mammolito and Elise Stein added two goals each. In total, 10 different players made their way into the scoring column, while sophomore goalie Amanda Longan finished with seven saves.
A few hours later, the Trojans took on No. 17 San Diego State in a rematch of last week’s home opener. After holding a 5-1 lead in the first frame, USC went on to score 12 more goals and allowed just three en route to the 17-4 victory over the Aztecs. Once again, 10 different scorers saw action in the afternoon, led by senior two-meter Brigitta Games and senior driver Stephania Haralabidis’ hat tricks. Junior goalie Victoria Chamorro tallied seven saves in three periods of work in the cage and in total, USC outscored both of its opponents on Saturday by a 35-6 margin.
 A solid outing in group play put USC into the semifinals of the tournament, where they matched up against No. 6-ranked Michigan. This was also a rematch of an earlier game this season in which the Trojans defeated the Wolverines 11-3 in their season opener, but once again USC came out victorious. 
Michigan put up more of a fight in this contest, though, as they held USC to under double-digit scoring for just the first time this season. The Wolverines kept it close at the half, trailing by two goals, but the Trojans came up big and punched in five more goals to cap the 9-5 win. Megens and Haralabidis scored two goals apiece and Longan hauled in eight saves to propel USC into the finals of the Triton Invitational, where they squared off against fellow MPSF foe Arizona State.
It was a low-scoring affair to start the match against the No. 5-ranked Sun Devils, as USC held just a 3-1 lead after two periods. However, the Trojans turned on the jets after the half and hit the back of the net nine more times, allowing just one goal the rest of the way to sew up the 12-2 victory and capture the tournament title.
Haralabidis recorded another hat trick to up her total to 10 goals on the weekend, while freshman driver Kelsey McIntosh and junior utility Hayley McKelvey tossed in two goals each. Chamorro put up 12 big saves in goal for the Trojans, shutting out the Sun Devils in the final period to put a stamp on USC’s winning weekend.
While the Trojans have yet to be pushed to the brink in 2017, Haralabidis noted that these types of matchups help the Trojans identify areas for improvement as the season progresses. 
“During these games, we work on what it is that we need to do to perform better,” Haralabidis said. “Even though it’s not some of the toughest competition out there, we’re preparing ourselves for the bigger ones that we’ll face in the MPSF and in the future. We always go in with the mentality that it’s a strong team though, so we just have to push even harder in order for us to get better.”
The Trojans will now prepare for another set of road games when they participate in the UC Irvine Invitational in two weeks (Feb. 24-26) in Irvine, Calif.

The No. 4 women’s lacrosse team left McAlister Field victorious this past Saturday afternoon with a 20-2 triumph over the Saint Mary’s Gaels in its 2017 season opener. USC began the defense of its MPSF title and improved to 5-0 all-time against Saint Mary’s with an offensive barrage that included goals from 12 different Trojans. 
For head coach Lindsey Munday, the Trojans’ first win is the first step towards another successful season.
“It’s exciting to start the season,” Munday said. “The first game, there’s usually some jitters, but I think they are really coming into their own. We’re just going to take everything one game at a time and taking every day to keep getting better individually and collectively as a team.”
Offensively, USC started the scoring off early as 2016 leading scorer and senior attacker Michaela Michael won the opening faceoff and later scored the game’s first goal. Before seven minutes had gone by, the senior attacker was leading all scorers with three goals, eventually adding an assist later in the half. Eventually, Saint Mary’s lack of interior defense and defensive penalties allowed USC to open the floodgates for eight goals before the first timeout. 
Early Gael scoring threats were thwarted by a USC defense that has rebounded well after losing 2016 MPSF Player of the Year Courtney Tarleton, the team’s best defender, to graduation. With eight minutes left in the first half, Saint Mary’s first shot on net was saved immediately by senior goalie Gussie Johns. 
USC added 13 goals before the Gaels eventually got on the board. With 4:31 minutes left in the half, Jocelyn Lubert fired a penalty shot past Johns that resulted in a 13-1 count in favor of USC. After 30 minutes, the Trojans added another goal to its commanding 14-1 lead as eight different Trojans netted goals.
Michael appreciated getting her teammates playing time throughout the game, especially in the first game of the year.
“It was nice to get everyone involved,” Michael said. “It’s weird coming back for the first game, it feels like forever since we had one. It’s definitely nice to get those early jitters out and get that first win. We definitely got reps with different groups, so it was nice to flow through the entire roster.”
The second half was more of the same for USC as junior Alexis Kardias, sophomore Allie Gershman, freshman Sarah Larkin (2), sophomore Gabbi Klein and freshman Kaeli Huff each scored goals. The Trojans’ scoring surge was quelled by Saint Mary’s backup goalie Cassidy Hoffman who registered a save and allowed six goals in relief of first-half goalie Sydney Pinello. 
The Gaels slipped another goal by the USC defense by way of Jill Dunlap, who weaved through defenders to make the score 20-2 with 2:30 minutes left in the game. Though game conditions were overcast and gray, by the time the horn sounded, USC pulled off its first win of the year.
The Trojans’ face-off victories (16 draw controls), shots on net (29 shots) and turnover margin (13 caused turnovers) all contributed to the win. Because of Saint Mary’s 19 turnovers, Johns and backup goalie Hannah Upshaw fielded just seven Gael shots, four of which were saved.
After their 18th consecutive victory at home, the Women of Troy (1-0) will play host to the No. 9 Northwestern Wildcats (2-0) — Munday’s alma mater — next Saturday at McAlister Field. 
Munday isn’t scared for the matchup, but rather excited.
“We’ve played them each year so far, it’s awesome,” Munday said. “They are a phenomenal team, and our girls get excited to play such a quality opponent.”

This semester, I’m taking a communication course titled “Sports and Social Change.” No, it’s not an “easy A.” People are always wrongly mislabeling the communication major as the token student-athlete major, which in itself is pretty unfair. 
As the spring semester has continued, this class exposed me to concepts within the realm of society and sports that I had never previously considered. It has reaffirmed my belief that the impact of sports stretches immensely beyond the field of play. 
One recent event in the world of sports has particularly driven me to observe things through the scope of this course. 
Last Wednesday, former New York Knicks player Charles Oakley shoved security guards, who then used force to escort him from Madison Square Garden. Oakley, who purchased a ticket to the Knicks game that night, claims that he was in the arena for a total of 4 1/2 minutes before a security official told him that there were orders for his removal from the venue. The shoving from Oakley soon followed when the guards attempted to grab him. 
Following the incident, Oakley was arrested and put into law enforcement custody in New York. He has since been released and has been very vocal about the altercation. 
Rumors have since arisen that hyper-controversial Knicks owner James Dolan was behind the orders to have Oakley removed from the arena. 
Just two days after the incident, Dolan fired the arena’s security chief. No statement from the organization has clarified the reason for the firing. 
The team did, however, release a statement on the incident Wednesday night. The Knicks said that Oakley’s telling of the incident was “pure fiction,” and they concluded their open letter with “he was a great Knick and we hope he gets help soon.” 
Before and after Wednesday night’s incident, Oakley is still one of the most popular figures in Knicks basketball lore. Oakley played 10 of his 19 NBA seasons for the Knicks; he earned All-Star honors in 1994. He was also selected to the NBA All-Defensive First Team in 1994. 
A majority of Knicks loyalists and NBA fans have embraced Oakley since the scuffle at the Garden took place, despite conflicting reports about what actually got him booted from the game. It should’ve been expected that many would side with Oakley over Dolan, considering that Dolan has a pretty brutal track record as an owner and human being overall. 
Remember the time that Dolan responded to a lifelong fan’s email by calling him “a sad person?” He also told that fan, “I’ll bet your life is a mess and you are a hateful mess.”
Shortly following the incident, popular comedian and Knicks superfan Michael Rapaport made an appearance on The Herd with Colin Cowherd. He said something really specific that piqued my interest, and I felt it really tied things back to the notion of sports and social change. He noted that Oakley, a gritty player with a heavy work ethic, “embodies what New Yorkers are.”
Here, my friends, is a prime example of the “us versus them” mentality which the working class has adopted for years. It’s the working fans in the nosebleeds of major sporting arenas battling the suits and team management who watch games from the luxury boxes just 20 feet above their heads. 
This social structure of “the people” (working-class fans) sticking it to “the man” (higher-ups in sports) has been embodied throughout sports history. 
Remember those “Where is Roger?” chants in Foxborough just a few weeks ago at the AFC Championship Game? That night the fans in Foxborough’s chants against NFL commissioner Roger Goodell were emblematic of the battle between the common man and the elites who are believed to be corrupt in their governing. 
I’ll never forget being a young kid at my first Dodgers game at Chavez Ravine several years ago. On a Wednesday afternoon game between the Dodgers and Marlins, former MLB commissioner Bud Selig made an appearance on the jumbotron at the stadium. What followed were chants of “You suck! You’re trash!”
While some high-ranking individuals in sports are considered endearing figures by fans, the tendency for working-class individuals is to be very critical of those in the major sports leadership roles. 
When that surefire top prospect is selected with a team’s top draft pick, and they don’t pan out successfully, it’s almost guaranteed that the fans of a franchise are calling for the head of the owner. 
As the owner of a major sports franchise, Dolan isn’t necessarily the most relatable individual for the general Knicks fan base. He should have considered what he was getting himself into when he decided to spark a battle with Oakley, a figure who “embodies” the New York Knicks’ fanbase.

Earlier this month, Wheaton College created a scholarship for refugee students from the seven Muslim-majority nations barred by President Donald Trump’s recent executive order. At a time when America seems to be closing its doors to the world, this scholarship should be seen as a guide to other American colleges to fight for the rights and opportunities of students most in need. In numerous memorandums to students from the administration, USC has maintained its dedication to support international students. However, the University should consider establishing a similar scholarship for disadvantaged students who are fleeing violence and persecution, as well as facing legal challenges as they attempt to enter the United States. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the executive order does not advance national security and is unconstitutional. Still, the court ruling did not affect the part of the executive order which caps the number of admitted refugees at 50,000, a number which pales compared to 110,000 allowed by former President Barack Obama. Even with the executive order temporarily halted, the world is still experiencing a refugee crisis that global institutions, both public and private, must amend.
Shortly after the executive order, Provost Michael Quick sent out a memorandum standing in solidarity with USC’s international students “regardless of their national origin or religious affiliation.” USC has reached out to students and faculty from the countries directly affected by the executive order and joins many other colleges and universities in affirming its commitment to its current international students. But the University has yet to adequately speak to what it is doing for refugee students with much talent to offer USC, but no means to attend.
It is worth noting that for 12 years, until 2014, USC led America in the population size of international students. In 2013, President C. L. Max Nikias stated that “USC continues to attract the most talented and creative students from all over the world — a point of tremendous pride for our community.” Additionally, as of Fall 2016, 10,571 international students attend USC. Nikias has boasted that “USC’s international students arrive on our campuses with a broad range of experiences and perspectives, as well as extraordinary intellect and creativity.” There is a long history of international cooperation in academia and a grave importance in fostering cultural exchange and awareness in our increasingly globalized world. But many international students are cut entirely from the conversation. Attending USC is a near impossibility for refugees.
The cost of attendance at USC for the 2016-2017 year including tuition and other expenses reached roughly $69,711. For all students, this cost can be a major barrier, but financial aid is not even an option available to international students. International students can get aid in the form of work, private loans and merit scholarships. There is one specific merit scholarship for international students, the International Freshman Academic Scholarship, which ranges from one quarter to half of tuition. 
International students may also apply to many of the same scholarships domestic students do, but many of these require an interview which can be a particularly expensive trip for international students that they might not be able to afford. All of this, of course, does not include the cost of applying for visas and green cards.
It’s no surprise that USC claims to so deeply value and commit to international students when they are, for the most part, paying tuition without need-based financial aid. There may be outside scholarships that international students can apply for and use at USC, but if we really believe that fostering our international community improves our university as a whole, then we should make USC accessible for people from a wider variety of countries, backgrounds and circumstances who lack the means to so much as apply to USC. 
USC must not promote diversity and attendance from international students due to financial motivations. The USC administration must demonstrate that its outreach toward international communities, particularly pertinent in today’s political climate, is not solely for financial gain. One way it could demonstrate this is to establish a refugee scholarship and open its doors to those facing violence and persecution to uphold education as a human right and enrich the USC community with the diversity that it lacks. 
It seems like for the next four years, the executive branch will turn its back on refugee students. Thus, it will be up to institutions to pick up the slack. As a school that takes so much pride in the size of its international community, USC should be taking the lead. 
A charitable concept, but what refugees do you mean? Legal immigrants admitted to the US under Federal programs? Or those who penetrate into the US, undocumented by visas or any other legal permission to enter?
For the sake of argument, perhaps you mean the undocumented, i.e., illegals. If so, they arrive without high school transcripts, SAT scores or even documents establishing their names and identities. How would you deal with that? USC has become increasingly selective!  Many fully qualified applicants are rejected because they did not make the cut. Where would the undocumented/illegals be placed? At the top of the admissions list? How would you score them against other applicants, or even against one another?
No, I am not proclaiming bias, hatred or wholesale rejection of immigrants. I am trying to figure out your objectives could fairly be reached without arbitrary selections.
Sadly, Trump’s contentious issue is yet one more that makes being an international student difficult, on top of our already complex culture and language. Assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   An award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.    
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Good luck to all at USC or wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who have the loudest voice!
This happened last April. The provost released a memo about it. Six scholarships.

Two Saturdays ago Melissa McCarthy stepped up to the Saturday Night Live stage dressed in a gray suit and high-forehead wig, unmistakably resembling Press Secretary Sean Spicer before she even walked up behind the mock White House podium. In the next eight minutes McCarthy delivered a scathing parody of Spicer’s press briefings, highlighting idiosyncrasies like his gum-chewing habit and the obvious larger issue of his aggressive relationship with the press. The performance, which went viral, was criticized most notably by a major donor to President Donald Trump whose quote was published by Politico: “Trump doesn’t like his people to look weak.” According to reports, the president was angered because McCarthy, as a woman, played Spicer, and on a program so pervasive across all political divides as is SNL.
Well, last Saturday McCarthy was back behind her podium, and after her came Kate McKinnon as Jeff Sessions, and then Leslie Jones donning a golden wig to play the president himself. It was a parade of women mocking Trump and his team, and if fans of the show have anything to do with it, this trend will only continue. One of Trump’s oldest foes, Rosie O’Donnell, recently changed her Twitter profile picture to one of her face layered over White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon before changing it back.
The fact stands: People love these women because they can nail these performances. And these performances can get under the skin of not only the president, but also every man and woman who voted him into office. Sure, the bumbling, raging energy McCarthy brings to her impression of Spicer is an insult to Trump, who has been very carefully invested in how Spicer looks and presents himself during briefings. But it’s not because she’s a woman. Women don’t make Trump’s administration look weak; strong women with strong performances are what makes comedy work. It takes a kind of unstoppable, unsilenceable bravery to determine every one of your subject’s idiosyncrasies and pull them to the surface, especially when your subject is supposed to be the mouthpiece of the highest seat in the land.
The bottom line is that Trump’s administration does not look weak because it is being portrayed by women. They look weak because they are weak, and SNL points out those flaws with a crystal clarity and a mercilessness that defines the resistance. The president displays less emotional stability than an 8-year-old, and his team members resemble old dogs set loose after being muzzled for decades. SNL put McCarthy-Spicer in a bangle and heels not to ridicule Spicer’s physicality, but instead to condemn the unethical behavior of disparaging Nordstrom (which had recently dropped Ivanka Trump’s brand) from the White House podium. 
Furthermore, the comment that a woman playing Spicer makes him look weak is degrading because of archaic generalizations: Where Trump and his donor may see a woman, the rest of the entertained world sees Melissa McCarthy — an iconic, versatile comedian. The actress is talented in bodily and spoken humor, leads a sprawling range of films, makes waves as a Hollywood phenom whose jokes can punch your gut as you lay laughing on the floor. That’s why SNL gave her the job — because she’s good, and because she’s funny and the fact that she’s a “she” doesn’t matter to anyone but apparently those who she is ridiculing.
As if we need any more proof how Trump and his team feel about women. Trump and his supporters revile these female SNL performers not because they weaken the image of their leaders, but because they are scared of strong women. If they weren’t, why would they tweet about it and make statements about it, lashing out like bullies whose insecurities have been brought to light in the playground? Because that’s what’s happening. And as long as our leaders keep making decisions that impinge upon the rights and humanity of Americans, strong women will be there to laugh at them every step of the way. Strong women who don’t care as much as Trump does care — that’s where the beauty of this lies. McCarthy doesn’t care. McKinnon and Jones don’t care. 
SNL does not occur in an echo chamber. The scope of who it reaches is not limited to those who agree with its content. It is pervasive because it is shareable, inescapable because it is loved and talked about. And that conversation reaches all ears, even those of the president. And I will admit, I take some satisfaction whenever SNL elicits admonishment from Trump, because that only makes its fanbase stronger. And it cements this reality: that SNL’s women scare him, every bit as much as he condescends and looks down upon their work. Simply, the more he complains, the funnier they’ll get.

If you use the group exercise classes at the Lyon Center like me, you may have noticed that with the spring semester came an addition to the workout class schedule. As my workout buddy and I were checking the times of our favorite SCycling classes, we noticed that a plethora of classes called F45 had been listed throughout the week.
I had no idea what these were. They sounded intense. Some were scheduled as early as 7:15 a.m. I thought, these must be a big deal if college students are filling a class at such ungodly hours. What’s more, I kept getting emails from the Lyon Center about their popularity, saying that more and more F45 classes were being added to the schedule. What was this fad taking over our gym?
Just a few days ago, I ran into a friend who mentioned that she was signed up for the 4:30 p.m. F45 class on Friday.
“Join me, they’re great!” she encouraged. So I did.
The F45 workouts are not unique to USC. F45 programs are used across the country and can be found in a variety of studios across Los Angeles. The program was originally developed by entrepreneurs in Australia in the interest of combining the most effective exercises into a 45-minute session of a High Intensity Interval Training circuit workout. The company provides 27 different workouts, with new variations being developed daily. This means that you are unlikely to ever repeat a workout. 
I was definitely tired and sweating after F45, since all the exercises were at a good, challenging level. The class was divided into several sections of circuits. The exercises at each station incorporated weights, jumping, squatting, deadlifts and more to emphasize cardio and agility. The circuit was designed for sections of work and rest, with one water break in the workout.

In order to take an F45 class at the Lyon Center, you must have purchased the group exercise passes for the semester, which gives you access to the yoga, pilates, SCycling, F45 classes (and more) at the gym. Then, download the app REC IT Fitness, which allows you to sign up for an F45 class. All you have to do is make an account and select “University of Southern California,” and then you can see all the timeslots of F45 classes and select the one you want. I had to join the waitlist for the Friday class, but easily got in a few hours later since some people dropped. F45 classes at USC are cardio-themed on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and more focused on strength Tuesdays and Thursdays.
It is easy to fall into a workout pattern and forget to challenge your muscles by changing things up. This is why I’ll be back for more of these classes. Not only did I learn new exercises, but the workout also pushed me harder than I push myself, which is a welcome test.
Check out more about the F45 workouts or find other studios in Los Angeles. Our Lyon Center workout schedule can also be found online.
