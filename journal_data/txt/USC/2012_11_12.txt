The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Friday, Nov. 9, and Sunday, Nov. 11. 
Crimes against property
at 11:23 p.m. on Nov. 11, two suspects spray-painted graffiti on walls and pillars at the University Village.
At 12:16 p.m. on Nov. 9, a suspect cut a hole in the screen on an open kitchen window at 1352 29th Street and climbed through the window. The suspect removed a wallet, speakers, two iPods and a set of vehicle keys, then used the keys to start a resident’s vehicle and drove away in it.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 6:49 p.m. on Nov. 10, DPS officers responded to a student who fell out of a university golf cart while negotiating a turn near the University Parking Center. The student sustained multiple abrasions to her knees and elbows, but she declined medical treatment and was released at the scene. The cart sustained minor damage to the front bumper when it rolled into a gate after the student fell out.
at 12:40 p.m. on Nov. 10, DPS officers responded to a student who sustained a cut when she was struck in the back of the head by a plastic cup that someone threw inside the 901 Bar and Grill. A Los Angeles Fire Department Rescue Ambulance unit treated the student and offered transportation for additional medical treatment, but she declined and was released at the scene.
at 9:03 P.m. on Nov. 9, a student at Parkside International Residence College reported that a photographer who took nude photos of him threatened to distribute the pictures over the Internet after he refused to schedule a second photo shoot.
Well played Tex.
He “Drove Away”…. you mean he “STOLE THE CAR”?
This is a particularly good week for Roundup.   Packed full of life lessons and interesting stories:
1) If you wallet and car keys are home, so should you
2) Women generally can’t drive properly and golf carts are the latest victims to be blamed.  Thank God the cart is okay!
3) Be sure and duck when stuff flies at the 9-0 and yes, plastic cups kill!
4) Don’t let me photograph you naked and then refuse to party with me again

USC leads the nation in international student enrollment for the 11th year in a row, according to a report released Monday.
The report was released by the Institute of International Education and supported by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs at the Department of State. In the 2011-12 school year, USC enrolled 9,269 international students with a record enrollment of 2,515 Chinese students representing the largest group. The second-largest group of international students were from India, with 1,265 enrolled. In fall 2011, about 71 percent of international students were participating in graduate programs.
President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement released Monday that USC’s large international student population enhances the educations of all students on campus.
“USC is so proud of its exceptional international students, as well as its ability to continually draw such talented students from all over the world,” Nikias said in a statement. “These students arrive on our campuses with a broad range of experiences and perspectives, as well as tremendous intellect and creativity. They benefit enormously from their time at USC, while our domestic students learn about cultures outside their own. The bonds our students form — and the professional connections they establish — remain with them for life.”
Associate Dean of Student Affairs Tony Tambascia said USC’s concerted efforts to attract international students will encourage them to attend the university.
“At USC, international students from over 115 different countries participate fully in both the academic and co-curricular aspects of campus life,” Tambascia said in a statement. “The university’s leadership is dedicated to helping international students have a great Trojan experience, and I think this is part of why so many students from around the world enroll each year.
The report also found that USC ranked sixth for the total number of students pursuing study abroad programs, with 2,340 students participating in these programs in the 2010-11 school year.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and New York University ranked second and third place, respectively, for number of international students, according to the report.

The Veterans Center for the Performing Arts, an L.A.-based performance organization, arrived at USC Monday night to perform an original play called Fit for Society in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Grand Ballroom.
Military life · Director Stephan Wolfert (left) and writer Brian Monahan discuss their play, Fit For Society, after a performance on Monday night. – Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan
The performance, which featured military veterans as actors, received a standing ovation from the audience, which itself was peppered with veterans.
Stephan Wolfert, who left a distinguished career in the military for a life in theater, explained afterward during a reception that he originally wrote the play as a result of the frustration he felt when he saw veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq face the same problems as veterans from earlier generations.
“We started seeing the same stories coming in [from Iraq and Afghanistan] that we experienced [in the Gulf War],” Wolfert said. “And a lot of our mentors are from the Vietnam era, and they’re going, ‘We’re seeing the same crap!’”
Despite the cyclical nature of war, Wolfert and his writing partner Brian Monahan hoped to use theater to raise civilian awareness of what veterans have to endure after coming home.
“There is a lack of understanding on the civilian side on basic things, like how to approach a homecoming veteran,” said Brian Monahan, co-writer of Fit for Society. “Veterans are coming home to civilians who really don’t have a language to … offer the support that they deserve.”
Wolfert and Monahan’s feeling of discontent shone brightly in the characters that appeared on the stage, each with a unique story and perspective.
One was a disgruntled female Air Force pilot who denounced the way the U.S. government treated female soldiers. Another was a retired Army soldier who unsuccessfully tried to cover up his emotional insecurities with a barrage of sarcastic remarks. Monahan himself played a legless Marine who spent a good five minutes complaining about how terrible the food was during his service.
At no time was actual combat addressed. Rather than mentioning guns or tanks — topics that movies and TV shows regularly regurgitate -— the play focused on the little details of what veterans face every day, such as night sweats, emptiness and suicidal tendencies.
In fact, suicide is one of Wolfert’s biggest fears when it comes to fellow veterans. “Eighteen veterans kill themselves everyday,” Wolfert said. “From the time you walked in [to the end of the play], one [veteran] has killed himself, and another is prepping to … that number will only rise if we don’t do something.”
Wolfert believes those harrowing statistics could be eased if the U.S. military spends more energy on transitioning its veterans to civilian life.
“The military has eight weeks of basic training in; couldn’t we have four weeks of basic training out?” he said.
There is no time to wait for the government to help, Monahan said.
“My biggest fear is that society does nothing; that we sit back and … withdraw our safety nets for returning veterans from Afghanistan,” Monahan said.
The Veterans Center for the Performing Arts puts on this show night after night to raise civilian awareness and to spread a simple message of empathy. And on Monday night, a packed ballroom got the message, loud and clear.

On Monday, all USC residence halls began requiring students to not only present their student ID, but also to scan their fingerprint in order to gain entry to their building.
Students received an email informing them of the change on Nov. 5.
“As part of USC Housing’s continuing effort to make your residence safer, we will be installing fingerprint scanners at every building entry point. Once the units are installed, each resident will be required to show a valid ID card and to authenticate his/her identity via fingerprint biometrics,” the email read.
Students had four days to scan their fingerprint and picture at their local Customer Service Center during the week prior to the change. Currently, the fingerprinting only applies to on-campus housing, though officials are now considering implementing the system in off-campus USC housing, as well.
Guests are still allowed into the residences, but are required to leave a valid ID in exchange for a guest pass.
During normal CSC business hours on weekdays, student workers will scan fingerprints and collect IDs from guests. When front desks are closed, security personnel will take responsibility.
“From 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 [a.m.] Monday through Friday and all day Saturday and Sunday, we will have an outside security company staffing the ID checkpoints,” USC Housing Director Keenan Cheung wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Michael Jackson, vice president for Student Affairs, said the changes are not related to an on-campus shooting that wounded four on Oct. 31.
“This is something we have been working on since probably the summer time,” Jackson said.
Jackson said the changes will prevent fewer unwanted guests from visiting the residence halls, especially during large on-campus events, such as tailgates.
“Now there is the technology available to allow us to ensure that the people who live there and who are invited by the people who live there get access to the residences,” Jackson said.
Students have reacted to the new policy with everything ranging from support to concern.
Though the cost of housing will not be affected by this change, Haylee Saathoff, a freshman studying print and digital journalism who resides in Webb Tower, said she didn’t see the need for the fingerprinting policy.
“I just don’t really understand what it’s supposed to do,” she said. “It seems like the money could be spent elsewhere.”
Another potential problem some students brought up is not being able to use certain stairwells. In Birnkrant Residential College, for example, students will no longer be allowed to use the stairs to access their rooms because the entrances to the stairwells are separate from the main lobby.
Birnkrant resident Asher Shasho-Levy, a freshman studying philosophy, politics and law, worried that this would infringe upon his daily routine, such as his weekly observance of religious holidays.
“I actually need the stairs, because as a Shabbat [Jewish Sabbath] observer, I’m not allowed to use electricity from Friday night to Saturday night,” he said.
Another issue that several students brought up was a concern for their privacy, though Cheung dismissed this fear.
“[Fingerprints] are stored locally on the specific device,” Cheung said. “There is no central storage dump. Computers are manned 24/7. These computers do not have access to Wi-Fi or the Internet and do not talk to one another. The program is encrypted as well.”
Despite some concern, other students were pleased with the new system.
“It’s better for the students’ safety and it’s better to be safe then sorry,” freshman Anna Lea Damir, who is majoring in chemical engineering (petroleum engineering), said.
 
Daniel Rothberg contributed to this report.
So far, the new security policies have cunningly prevented crime by making the fingerprint verification so annoying that I avoid my dorm as much as possible, and ensuring that I take my phone and computer with me each morning when I leave so I can do my work at Doheny.

USC Concerts Committee, a group within Program Board, and the USC Office of Campus Activities announced that Childish Gambino will headline Thursday’s Conquest concert -— part of an annual spirit rally before the USC-UCLA football game.
Childish Gambino is one of the first solo artists to perform for Conquest. In the past, headliners for Conquest included Cobra Starship, Third Eye Blind, the Dan Band and OK GO. Comedian Michael Ian Black will host this year’s Conquest.
Donald Glover, who performs under the stage name Childish Gambino, released his first hip-hop mixtape in 2008. Last November, he released Camp, his first album on a major record label. The record has sold more than 160,000 copies in the United States. Glover also has a career in television and film: he was an actor on NBC’s Community and a member of the sketch comedy group Derrick Comedy that wrote the feature-length film Mystery Team.
This year, Conquest starts at 7 p.m. and will be held on McCarthy Quad. Students are required to show their student IDs to enter the concert.
Most students reacted positively to the announcement of Childish Gambino as the Conquest headliner, including Konrad Mueller, a sophomore majoring in economics and mathematics.
“I’m really stoked that Gambino is playing,” Mueller said. “I feel like he’s one of the best up-and-coming rappers in the rap game right now and I feel like it’s awesome that we were able to land such a great act like that.”
Though some students were excited for the newcomer artist, other students expressed disappointment.
“I’d heard of Childish Gambino before, but I never listened to [him] so I’m going to listen to [him] now,” said Jennifer Bailey, a freshman neuroscience major. “But I’m just wondering why we couldn’t get anyone more famous.”
In addition to Gambino, Conquest will include performances by the Trojan Marching Band and the Song Girls. Plans for the event also include a bonfire and fireworks display.
Regardless of whether students are excited or ambivalent toward Childish Gambino’s performance, most students said they were excited for the Conquest celebration and the football game against UCLA on Saturday.
Francisco Gomez-Palacio, a freshman majoring in music industry, said he was eager to experience his first Conquest.
“Ever since Childish Gambino’s Camp album came out, I’ve been a big fan,” Gomez-Palacio said. “I think it’s going to be really fun on a college campus, so I’m really excited for it to happen.”
 
Yasmeen Serhan contributed to this report.
FINALLY The committee chooses someone I can get pumped for. He’s quite honestly the best artist today. He’s not new, upcoming maybe, but he’s been around for a while, it’s just that now people are paying attention.
not *was. *is an actor on NBC’s Community.

Think about it for a moment. In all sincerity, do you, at present, feel comfortable with the state of USC’s football program? Are you confident its trajectory points upward? Do its best days, in fact, lie ahead?
Are you absolutely confident in a head coach that flirts with the ethical line for the sake of maintaining a so-called competitive advantage? Are you confident NCAA sanctions won’t leave more than a scratch on the windshield?
Don’t answer yet. Sit. Think about it all for at least another minute or two.
Now again, do you, in all honesty, view this season as the stepping stone to something higher?
It’s rivalry week in Los Angeles, where the annual crosstown showdown pits the city’s two premier college football programs against each other on the gridiron. USC and UCLA square off at the Rose Bowl on Saturday afternoon in a nationally televised showdown. So we ask ourselves these questions as a State-of-the-Union-like examination. And perhaps, ever since UCLA forecasted five years ago the end of Los Angeles’ football monopoly with the now-infamous poster of former coach Rick Neuheisel, we look at this same old topic all the more intently. Who has the upper hand? Is Los Angeles cardinal, or is it blue?
Recent results illustrate the obvious. It’s been an ’SC town, at least lately. The Trojans have won 12 of the last 13 games against UCLA and have been serious contenders for the conference and national title for much of the last decade. Arguing otherwise — especially in the wake of last season’s 50-0 shellacking at the Coliseum — seems pointless.
But mind you, this marks the first time since 2001 that UCLA, No. 17, is ranked higher than USC, No. 18. And the Bruins sport the better record to boot at 8-2 overall.
“He’s ranked ahead of us in his first year,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said of the Bruins’ freshman head coach, Jim Mora, during Sunday night’s teleconference with reporters. “He’s doing really well over there.”
The records to this point don’t suggest too much, but they do highlight a rather evident trend: These two teams are as close as they’ve been in recent memory.
For years we’ve been wondering if UCLA would ever gain some sort of an upper hand in a rivalry that’s stayed particularly one-sided since the turn of the century. Now that the Bruins hold the advantage in the national rankings, we must recognize the significance of what a UCLA win over USC would be come Saturday: It would tip the scale in the direction of Westwood. It’d serve as a springboard for Mora and Co., while marking an irreparably disappointing 2012 season for Kiffin’s bunch.
Kiffin, during his short tenure at USC, has been hampered by one controversy and one road block after another. Less than six months on the job, the program was hit with sanctions, then he was the target of a lawsuit filed by the NFL’s Tennessee Titans. In year two, an assistant coach resigned following ties to street agent Willie Lyles, the center of an NCAA probe. And in year three, the year the program was expected to take the defining leap, too much attention has been wasted on off-the-field distractions such as Kiffin storming out of a press conference, the jersey switching and the scolding for deflating game balls.
If anything, UCLA seems to have karma working in its favor.
On this side of town, the Trojans are  also set to face some pressing challenges in the next couple years. Their next two recruiting classes will be smaller by a combined 20 fewer players, leaving those players free to enroll elsewhere — say, at UCLA.
And many of the apparent on-the-field problems during Kiffin’s tenure have only lingered: poor tackling, poor game management and an inability to contain spread offenses still plague the team.
These are real challenges USC faces in the final stretch of 2012, and heading into next year, these same challenges won’t disappear. At some point, they’ll need to be tackled, but it doesn’t bode well considering they’ve only been accentuated in recent months and seemingly made worse.
The fact of the matter remains: USC, which carries just one victory over a team with a winning record after 10 games, has underachieved. UCLA, meanwhile, with Mora at the helm, has found a new dynamic quarterback in redshirt freshman Brett Hundley and has moved within grasp of a 10-win season, while using many of the same players that were a part of last season’s debacle versus USC. So yeah, by comparison, the Bruins have overachieved.
There is plenty at stake: Whoever wins Saturday clinches a spot in the Pac-12 title game as the South representative. There is plenty that can change the flavor of the rivalry. There is plenty to suggest the programs are walking in different directions.
Streaks don’t last forever.

Very unbiased interesting article
Just a lot of hot air
Isn’t Joey Kaufman the same underpant who just ten weeks ago bragged that there was no longer any need for Arrogant Nation?
Oh, yes he is.

After Friday’s season opener against Coppin State, USC men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill was asked about the play of backup center Omar Oraby, who had racked up 16 points and six rebounds in only 14 minutes on the court.
Facilitator · Though senior guard Jio Fontan didn’t light up the scoresheet in his return from a torn ACL, he did post seven assists in his season debut. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
“He’s a great teammate, he moves the ball, he’s a great passer, he’s a shot blocker,” O’Neill said before looking down at the box score in front of him. “Fourteen minutes and 16 points. Man, I gotta start playing this guy more often.”
Oraby, who was just approved to play for the Trojans last Thursday after transferring from Rice, is just one piece of USC’s talented frontcourt. Even after his breakout performance, Oraby will still begin Tuesday’s home game against Long Beach State on the bench because of similarly strong showings from starters Dewayne Dedmon and Eric Wise.
Dedmon, a junior, collected a career-high 12 rebounds to lead all players and Wise, a senior, got the ball rolling for USC by scoring the first four points of the game on his way to totaling seven points, three rebounds and two assists.
The Trojans were never truly threatened by Coppin State, but the team was nevertheless relieved to win their first game and end a 10-game skid that dated back to last season. Now, they say they’re hungry for more.
“It felt good to start the year off well and get a win under our belts,” sophomore guard Byron Wesley said. “Now we’re just looking forward to Tuesday.”
On Tuesday, USC plays its first opponent that made it to the NCAA tournament last season in the 49ers, who finished 25-9 and were crowned the Big West Conference champions.
Long Beach State was seeded No. 12 in the West Regional last March and lost to fifth-seeded New Mexico 75-68 in the Round of 64.
The 49ers are slated as the preseason favorite to repeat in the Big West despite returning only one starter, forward John Ennis, who averaged 10.1 points and 3.8 rebounds last year.
“They’ve won [20 or more] games over the past couple years now,” O’Neill said. “They’re a very good, well-coached team.”
Long Beach State defeated Division II North Alabama 75-65 in its season opener, with Ennis scoring a game-high 19 points. The team did, however, commit 26 turnovers.
Like the Trojans, the 49ers are expected to lean heavily on transfers this season, with new faces coming in from West Virginia, Arizona State, DePaul and Loyola Maramount. However, only West Virginia transfer Dan Jennings has been cleared to play for Long Beach State thus far.
USC will have a distinct size advantage over the 49ers — Long Beach State’s two frontcourt starters are 6-foot-7 and 6-foot-9, while USC boasts Dedmon, Oraby and senior center James Blasczyk, who are all at least 7 feet tall.
USC’s game against the 49ers marks the beginning of a nonconference gauntlet. Next week, the Trojans play Illinois in the first round of the Maui Invitational. Depending on the result of that showdown, USC could play against Texas, UNC, Marquette, Butler or Mississippi State in the following rounds.
“It’s going to be really difficult,” O’Neill said. “I think we’re playing the best nonconference schedule in the country.”
The Trojans tip off against the 49ers Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. at the Galen Center.

UCLA finally got its signature win over rival USC. For the next year, it has bragging rights over its crosstown enemies.
The win won’t count toward its 2012 campaign on the gridiron, though it didn’t even involve the football team. But there were a lot of happy fans in powder blue in Westwood.
Rousing success · In its first year, the “We Run the City” race raised $51,527 for the 2015 Special Olympics World Games. – Photo courtesy of Special Olympics of Southern California
UCLA raised $28,510 and defeated USC in the first annual We Run the City 5k run sponsored by the Special Olympics of Southern California on Sunday at UCLA. The event, which raised $51,527 in total, will be held annually during rivalry week at the university hosting the football game in subsequent years. The money raised helps fund the 2015 Special Olympics World Games, which will be held at USC.
“It’s a great way to actually get the students and fans and supporters to get out there and run and compete athletically,” Special Olympics Southern California President Bill Shumard said. “Their participation will make a difference as to who owns the city.”
Spirit leaders from both schools cheered on more than 1,000 participants at the event. UCLA met three criteria to win: It raised the most money, had more team members than USC and had 100 people cross the finish line before the Trojans.
It was a typical college sports scene in Wilson Plaza Sunday morning: UCLA’s band played the school’s fight song and Joe Bruin helped get fans excited. The USC Song Girls wore their signature sweaters. And, naturally, there was a lack of cheering from USC fans when UCLA’s totals were announced and vice versa.
When it’s rivalry week, it can’t be any other way.
Shumard is no stranger to the USC-UCLA rivalry. He worked in the USC Sports Information Department for three years before eventually becoming athletic director at Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State, his alma mater. He became a member of the Special Olympics Southern California Board of Directors after the organization approached him about holding the Summer Games at Long Beach.
When he took over as president of Special Olympics Southern California in 2005, he wanted to incorporate the competitive spirit of rivalry week into a fundraising event involving the collegiate spirit to which he is so accustomed.
“We want to see that rivalry at its best,” Shumard said. “We want both sides sort of getting after each other leading up to the football game the following Saturday. That’s what rivalry week’s all about.”
And it is certainly true that the crosstown rivalry has a life of its own off the gridiron.
Every year, students at USC wrap up and protect Tommy Trojan from UCLA pranksters who wish to deface the iconic statue. Meanwhile, students in Westwood guard their Bruin statue from USC’s vandalizing tactics. We Run the City is one more way for students to get involved in the heated rivalry, while raising money for a cause at the same time.
“It brings a level of competitiveness,” Shumard said. “There were no two better weeks [at USC] than UCLA week and Notre Dame week.”
But beyond the competitiveness of the runners participating on the day of the race and in the collegiate rivalry itself is something far more important to Shumard and others: the disabled athletes they are raising money for.
“People forget that our athletes can have that level of talent,” Special Olympics Southern California Vice President of Communications and Marketing Kelly Kloepping said.
And she has a valid point.
At the 2011 World Games in Athens, athletes competed in 22 different categories of events, including half marathon, equestrian, bocce and even judo. And as Shumard pointed out, the athletes don’t want to be thought of as different; they take their sports incredibly seriously.
“They do not want you to feel sorry for them,” Shumard said. “And I think people’s first reaction is ‘Oh, those poor people. Isn’t that wonderful?’ They don’t want to hear that. They are competitors at heart.”
Shumard said things even get a little heated among competitors when it comes to the games.
“Our athletes are really no different than anyone else,” Shumard said. “They compete to win. It doesn’t mean that our athletes don’t occasionally trash talk.”
That competitive spirit for the Special Olympics is not limited to the athletes themselves, though. Sunday was as much an indicator as any that participants in We Run the City were as fired up about the race, the cause and the schools they represent as they were about the football game Saturday.
“I think when you put two groups of people that want to be the best together, with this kind of history, you have to be involved,” race participant Tony Hobley said. Hobley is the managing director for RAPP Marketing Agency Network’s Los Angeles branch. His office had two teams: one for the Trojans and one for the Bruins. He raced for USC, and things got a little heated in the workplace and during the race itself.
“You could feel the passion when we were out here on the course, everybody sort of giving each other a little bit of ‘you know what,’” Hoble said. “But it’s great. I think this is the start of something huge that everyone’s going to want to be involved in.”
Another member in RAPP’s office, Milton Weaver, was racing on behalf of his Bruins. He was a key instigator in the office rivalry.
“It was very fun, because I initiated the rivalry email in the office,” Weaver said. “We had two teams … and [UCLA was] winning by about $200, and I put out an email [saying], ‘I would be embarrassed if I went to ’SC.’ And then ’SC’s jumped up by $300 and then we came back and we ended up winning. But it’s all for a good cause.”
Though in its inaugural year, Kloepping hopes that the competitive juices that flow in Trojans and Bruins will lead to better events down the road.
“All over the board, we have students from the two schools offering support,” Kloepping said. “Our hopes are that this is going to get better every year.”
And though the Bruins ultimately won the day, it didn’t really matter. What mattered was that the schools had come together for a common goal.
“The concept of the rivalry I think is perfect,” Weaver said. “It’s a positive ending to a good, fun little rivalry that doesn’t turn into violence. It doesn’t turn into real negative energy. It’s about putting that rivalry energy to a good cause.”

Throughout modern gaming history, first-person shooters have held a significant portion of the video game market. And within the first-person shooter genre, two major juggernauts stand out in the eyes of avid gamers: Call of Duty and Halo. By displaying dazzling, big-budget spectacles and offering competitive multiplayer experiences, Call of Duty and Halo have established themselves as two of the most critically successful and best-selling video game franchises of all time.
November will witness one of the biggest showdowns in video game sales history with the releases of Halo 4 and Call of Duty: Black Ops II, which are separated by a mere week. Enhanced by Nintendo’s release of the Wii’s successor, the Wii U, November promises an exciting month for games.
The year 2007 marked the supposed death of a giant, as major American game developer Bungie separated from Microsoft Studios and lost grip on the reins of the Halo franchise. Formed under Microsoft Studios, 343 Industries stepped up to the plate to take on the challenge of creating Halo 4. With a current Metacritic score of 87 percent indicating “Generally Favorable Reviews,” it appears 343 Industries has successfully returned the Halo franchise to its former glory with the best-looking installment yet.
Intended to be the start of a second Halo trilogy, Halo 4 picks up four years after the events of Halo 3 as super-soldier Master Chief awakes to the sight of a Forerunner planet called Requiem. Aided by his faithful artificial intelligence companion, Cortana, Master Chief must discover the secrets nestled within the cracks of Requiem and confront the deadly and technologically advanced race of Prometheans, an evolved caste of the “extinct” Forerunners who have retained their ancient hatred toward humans.
Aside from its goals to make the fourth installment part of a larger trilogy, 343 Industries has exceedingly enhanced Halo’s multiplayer experience. One highlight is Halo 4’s Spartan Ops feature: In this game mode, players must complete several objective-based missions either cooperatively with other players online or as lone wolves, if they so please. Uniquely, Spartan Ops reveals its own storyline in a series of episodes, which will be updated on a weekly basis.
Classic fans of the series will truly appreciate Halo 4’s War Games feature. Similar to multiplayer in past Halo titles, War Games sports familiar fan favorites, including Team Slayer and Capture the Flag, that players can choose from. On top of these, Halo 4 introduces a mechanic called Specialization. Players are now able to customize their loadouts, choosing a primary and secondary weapon, a grenade and their own specific armor ability. Such versatility and customization establishes Halo 4, which hit shelves Nov. 6, as a significant title in the Halo franchise.
Just one week after the release of Halo 4, the Xbox 360’s best-selling video game franchise gives birth to its newest title: Call of Duty: Black Ops II. Though the Call of Duty franchise adds a new release every year, Black Ops II promises an element of originality with a unique setting and innovative game mechanics.
Set during both the Cold War and the year 2025, Black Ops II allows players to manipulate robotic drones and use cyberwarfare along with more traditional firearms to defeat their enemies.
A new feature in the Call of Duty franchise is the mechanic behind “Strike Force” missions, which are dynamic situations or events the player comes across during the 2025 story arc. Each outcome of the Strike Force missions informs the rest of the storyline, incorporating the player’s choices and performance into the game’s campaign. The missions cannot be replayed, even if you fail them, for the rest of the playthrough, unless the player starts a completely new campaign.
Accompanied by its familiar and satisfying matchmaking capabilities, Call of Duty: Black Ops II promises to be a sure hit in the hands of faithful, first-person-shooter diehards. It will be available at game retail stores on Nov. 13.
In the world of video game hardware, a new challenger has appeared in the form of Nintendo’s latest creation: the Wii U. Intended to be the successor to the third best-selling home console of all time, the Wii, the Wii U boasts several new advancements for enhanced gameplay and experience.
The most prominent feature appears in the form of the Wii U’s GamePad. Including an incorporated touchscreen and motion control capabilities, the GamePad serves as the Wii U’s primary controller. Because of its elaborate design, the GamePad offers a wide variety of features that can be incorporated into games available for the Wii U. Aside from gameplay, the GamePad can assist in television multitasking, allowing users to display the game on the GamePad’s touchscreen while someone watches something else on television.
With such technology, Nintendo promises to change the world of video gaming forever. Will the Wii U triumph over its Microsoft and Sony counterparts? Decide for yourself when the Wii U becomes available on Nov. 18.
Thanks i did enjoy the post very much.

In a corner of the museum, a painting hangs surrounded only by the sounds of soft chatter and footsteps. Yet the piece seems to speak volumes with its unique mixture of colors and inspiration from one of the biggest music genres in history: the blues.
The Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art’s current show “Blues for Smoke” looks at this intersection — particularly at the way different artists’ aesthetics communicated their love for a single music genre. Everything from installations to paintings to even a work displayed on an iPad explore the impact of the blues, its biggest figures and its lasting influence.
Out of the many pieces paying homage to one facet of blues or another, Beauford Delaney’s “Untitled” (1957) proves especially captivating. Though the artist also painted straightforward portraits of major blues artists such as Charlie Parker, “Untitled” takes on a more abstract interpretation of the blues. Featuring a complex, entangled composition, Delaney’s piece suggests that a complicated work can reveal much about the artist and his artistic process .
“Untitled” features a conglomeration of colors, bright blue popping out from a mostly red and yellow background. The erratic arrangement of colors calls to mind the drip technique of Jackson Pollock, but the yellow paint gives the piece a softer, more welcoming aura. Delaney worked in the abstract expressionist mode in Paris back in the 1950s, so the work very much reflects the aesthetic thought of his other works in the show — even though he didn’t limit his work to that aesthetic. No inch of the canvas escapes the paint and the colors sometimes swirl into circles that break up the chaotic nature of the rest of the piece Delaney’s uniquely expressive style.
“Blues for Smoke” presents the idea of artists taking on the blues but that, in turn, opens the door for other intimate insights into these artists’ lives. Many of them create works that share tidbits like family history and though Delaney’s “Untitled” is less obvious, it too could tell viewers about the artist. Delaney’s younger brother Joseph shares in the book “Beauford Delaney: A Retrospective” that Beauford greatly enjoyed singing and playing the ukulele. In comparison to his younger brother, Beauford was more lively and outspoken.
“Untitled,” then, feels like the musical musings of Delaney paired with the emotional resonance of the blues. Just when it seems like a certain pattern will arise, another color pops up to change the mood. At first glance, a viewer’s tendency might be to form a shape out of the bright blue, but the piece ultimately works as a whole; each color blends into another to create a frenzy of movement that pulls the viewer’s eye in. Trying to find just one shape or form in the work would mean not appreciating it completely.
Perhaps blues music did the same for Delaney. It’s possible he switched on a song while he worked and let the paint guide his reactions to the notes floating around him. If that’s true, they Delaney’s piece fits right into the rest of “Blues of Smoke,” which features video clips of musicians performing complex pieces of music. “Untitled” is not an easy canvas to behold because your eyes don’t quite know where to go, but this complexity is in line with the instrumental gymnastics of the musicians.
Seeing the work in comparison to Delaney’s portraits makes it all the more impressive; in looking at the blues, the artist can construct a typical image of a particular figure, but he can also express the more entangled emotions the music engenders in him. “Untitled” proves a more personal piece as it reflects Delaney’s inner workings rather than outside images as the portraits do.
Abstract expressionist works of art are especially hard to decipher because they don’t offer viewers a concrete image to hold onto. Yet Delaney’s layering of colors makes the piece more accessible if the viewer lets go of the need to over analyze the work. Yes, the layers of color create a very complicated, packed image, but ultimately the viewer’s natural reaction proves more important. Whatever reaction “Untitled” engenders — delight, confusion, curiosity — ultimately reflects Delaney’s own process of creating. This emotional impact lasts longer than the viewer registering a simple image; in viewing the canvas, they can take away a piece of the artist and engage with the work on a deeper level.
Delaney’s incorporation of blues music with the dynamic quality of the painting ultimately makes his work a different piece to each person that approaches it. Someone might see a shape the next person doesn’t or spot a pattern another person cannot decipher. The hybrid complexity of music and color has lived on through the passage of decades and the birth of many other genres — ones that will hopefully give rise to equally intriguing pieces.
 
“Blues for Smoke” runs until January 7 at the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA, located on 152 North Central Ave.

If you’re in USC’s Thematic Option program — or even if you just want to reserve a ticket online — you have the chance to personally tour one such classics museum this Tuesday, Nov. 13, by attending the biannual College Night event at the Getty Villa, free of charge.

According to Shelby Brown, education specialist for academic and adult audiences at the J. Paul Getty Museum and the woman responsible for organizing the event, College Night is hosted by the Getty’s Education Department and provides a way for students to get a glimpse of the inner workings of the museum.
“The Getty Villa, which replicates an ancient seaside mansion, is a small museum centered on classical antiquity, and we enjoy introducing students to our special site,” she said. “During College Night at the Villa, representatives from all different areas of the museum will offer tours of the collection and labs to explain what they do.”
Brown said they have also invited members of Legio VI Victrix, historical re-enactors, to come dressed as Romans. This year, there will be several Roman Runway shows and many photo opportunities with “Romans.”  Additionally, the theme of this College Night is centered around the current exhibition, “The Last Days of Pompeii: Decadence, Apocalypse, Resurrection.”
According to the exhibit website, the unique exhibition draws its name from Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s 1834 novel The Last Days of Pompeii, a melodrama of Pompeiian life set immediately before the eruption of Vesuvius.
The novel was chosen as the theme because, as one of the most popular literary works of the 19th century, it transformed modern perceptions of Pompeii and inspired numerous artists — from Ingres to Duchamp to Dali to Warhol — and works of art, several of which are on view in the exhibition. Contemporary issues, such as sexual identity, are also addressed through this theme.
The exhibit has been running since Sept. 12 and will  stay open until Jan. 7, meaning that USC students are fortunate to be able to see it before time runs out.
College Night is not a new event; Brown also says the Getty Center has a College Night every spring, and the next one is scheduled for April 15.
“In 2009, shortly after the Villa opened, we started to host College Night to encourage students to visit the museum for fun,” she said. “[Many students come to the Villa] because of a class assignment or because their teachers brought the whole class. We wanted to offer a completely voluntary, open kind of experience in the museum that is separate from school obligations.”
Many factors will contribute to this unique experience: According to the College Night web page, students can expect special tours and presentations, free food and drinks, music by DJ AUDIOMOE, GettyGuide multimedia players to explore galleries on their own, Caricature artists, door prizes, 20 percent discounts at the Getty Store and more.
“[To further enhance the event], we encourage students to come dressed in togas, the citizen dress,” Brown said. “Armor and gladiatorial equipment and women’s fabrics will be available for students posing in front of our large Erupting Volcano model.”
USC students are very excited to get this special opportunity. Classics enthusiasts and newbies alike are thrilled to get the chance to be a part of something so unique. For many, the night will be their first foray into Los Angeles’ reputed museum culture.
“I really enjoy opportunities to explore different kinds of art and expand my knowledge of art here in L.A.,” said Kayla Foster, a freshman majoring in international relations and East Asian languages and cultures. “With the Thematic Option trip, I can do that in a special way as I share opinions and learn from other college students and my incredibly insightful Thematic Option professors.”
Brandon Cheung, an undeclared freshman, added, “I’m personally excited to be going to the Getty Villa with my Thematic Option classmates, as the study of Greco-Roman culture and art fits in so perfectly with both the ideas of my CORE 102 course, and the personal expertise of my professor. It’s one thing to talk about classical history, but I’d say it’s quite another thing to experience it firsthand, in the context of the heavy intellectual environment myself and my fellow T.O. classmates thrive in.”
 
College Night at the Getty Villa is tonight from 6:00 – 9:30 p.m, but students should arrive by 7:30 p.m. Thematic options students interested Getty Villa program should sign up at the Thematic Option office as soon as possible, as space and tickets are limited. Students not in Thematic Option should reserve free tickets online at the Getty Villa website and be prepared to their student I.D. at the museum entrance.

For more than 25 years, the American Film Institute has curated a weeklong collection of film screenings in the heart of Hollywood: AFI Fest, the longest-running international film festival in Los Angeles. Every fall, the celebration of cinema runs concurrently with the American Film Market — another cinema industry event — comprising one of the greatest artistic and financial annual events in North America.

AFI Fest is like no other film festival in the world; its docket of movies is incredibly diverse and often critically acclaimed, that it’s almost impossible to comprehend how the selecting committee assembles such a lineup. Rather than focus on hoarding as many grand premieres and star-studded showings as possible, the AFI Fest strives to present the audience with excellent cinema at no cost (all tickets are free).
In 2012, the AFI Fest and its director, Jacqueline Lyanga, created a program that included an astounding 140 films, 84 in the feature film category and 56 other films in the form of shorts from 28 different countries. Divided into 10 categories — Galas, Special Screenings, Young Americans, New Auteurs, World Cinema, Midnight, Breakthrough, Guest Artistic Director, Secret Screening and Shorts — the festival presents movies for any viewer’s taste.
This year, the world premieres of two huge awards contenders, Hitchcock and Lincoln, bookended the extravaganza, but the festival included everything from rich foreign dramas to experimental thrillers. The selected films below offer a glimpse at the varied excellence that was showcased at AFI Fest.
Rise of the Guardians in 3D
Nearly all film festivals are specifically for professional filmmakers, critics and movie enthusiasts; seldom do these gatherings cater to a younger audience and families. AFI Fest, however, included in its 2012 schedule a Sunday afternoon matinee: the L.A. premiere of Dreamworks Animation’s latest film, Rise of the Guardians.
Director Peter Ramsey’s feature film debut tells the story of Jack Frost as he joins the famed Guardians, a team comprised of Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, Sandman and the Tooth Fairy. Based on William Joyce’s children’s books, the animated fantasy features an all-star voice cast of Alec Baldwin, Chris Pine, Hugh Jackman and Jude Law. Usually, casting well-known actors in animated films is just an attempt to generate more revenue for a film, but in Rise of the Guardians, every voice works seamlessly. Every character seems unique and as out-of-this-world as Joyce’s fantastical creatures should be. The animation and 3-D visuals stun with a wonderful array of color and detailed imagination. Ultimately, Rise of the Guardians is an action-packed treat for children and adults alike, especially during the holiday season.
Rust and Bone
Written and directed by award-winning filmmaker Jacques Audiard, Rust and Bone follows the romantic story of Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) and Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts), who each find strength in their bond even as they struggle with tragedy. The story comes off as much more complex and dense than any traditional Hollywood romance, as it paints vivid portraits of these complicated characters. Audiard takes his audience on an enthralling, melodramatic roller coaster throughout the film, which hinges on excellent performances by Cotillard and Schoenaerts.
Cotillard, especially, infuses Stephanie with extreme depth and raw emotion, which moves the viewer through the character’s adversity. And with revealing cinematography, a moving score and realistic visual effects, Rust and Bone succeeds on a multitude of cinematic levels.
The Impossible
The narrative behind J.A. Bayona’s compelling drama revolves around the unbelievable true story of the Belon family during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. After beautifully developing the state of multiple relationships in a brief opening scene, The Impossible delivers one of the most visceral and realistic disaster sequences in recent film memory. The majority of filmmakers tends to focus on spectacle and grandiose scope when fictionalizing disaster, but Bayona smartly prioritizes the characters’ experiences over the visuals. Furthermore, because of superb performances from leads Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, as well as newcomer Tom Holland, the tsunami scene and overall film achieve brilliant results.
The visuals of The Impossible are simply gorgeous and the eerie music, though overly sentimental in some cases, matches the horrifying destruction of the tsunami. But the morals and themes of the film often outshine the authenticity of the catastrophe, leading to a drama that both thrills with action and mesmerizes with emotion.
Zaytoun
Winner of People’s Choice Third Place at the Toronto International Film Festival, Zaytoun made its U.S. premiere amid lofty expectations, and for the most part, those expectations were met. Eran Riklis’ foreign drama about the unlikely bond between a teenage Palestine refugee (Abdallah El Akal) and a fallen Israeli pilot (Stephen Dorff) is an interesting political and social commentary on the historic predicament of the region. The two are attempting to escape a war-stricken Lebanon for safety in Israel. Though tensions between Palestinians and Israelis are extremely volatile, the relationship development of Yoni (Dorff) and Fahed (El Akal) illustrates Riklis’ hope for a sliver of realistic optimism. He demonstrates his faith for some unity of people through a suspense thriller that is authentic to its subject and also metaphorically powerful.

Last Wednesday, Los Angeles City Council members approved the creation of a controversial city identification card that could be used by illegal immigrants to open bank accounts and access city services, such as libraries. The purpose of the cards is to incorporate Los Angeles’ vast undocumented population into civic life.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
This new policy only exacerbates America’s fragile immigration situation by granting illegal immigrants a confusing partial-citizenship status. Yet proponents continue to push for these kinds of measures under the guise of fighting inequality.
In reality, Los Angeles’ new card represents nothing but another step toward total amnesty for the nation’s undocumented immigrants — something that should be avoided as it could irreparably damage state economies for years to come.
Many argue that taking strong steps toward making illegal immigrants legitimate members of the U.S. community is long overdue. L.A. City Councilman Ed Reyes described the new city card as a measure that “allows people who have been living in the shadows to be out in the light of day.”
But there are serious and long-reaching effects to bringing illegal immigrants “out of the shadows” that cannot be overlooked. Most significantly, giving illegal immigrants the ability to open American bank accounts and pay taxes on utility bills is a step in the direction of eventually granting them amnesty, not in the direction of repairing a broken border. Though many humanitarian and political arguments exist for reforming our system to accommodate current illegal immigrants, it’s equally pressing that Congress finds a way to stem the issue at the source. Offering services to illegal immigrants only perpetuates the dilemma at hand.
According to the Federation for Immigration Reform, the cost of services — ranging from education to health care — used by illegal immigrants in California is already a staggering $21.8 billion a year. And The Center for Immigration Studies found that, after amnesty, Medicaid charges alone for current illegal immigrants would cost California $8.1 billion more annually. Social security, Medicare and education expenses would add even more on to that.
This is all to say that, considering a state deficit estimate that swelled to $16 billion this year, California is in a fiscal bind and simply cannot afford the additional cost that granting amnesty to illegal immigrants would bring to the state.
Nevertheless, it is widely believed that illegal immigrants greatly benefit our economy by working in valuable but undesirable jobs. Though it is true that illegal immigrants make up a portion of California’s workforce, the low wages that these jobs often offer would not be enough to cover the cost of granting amnesty with tax revenue. According to a 2011 report from the Center for Immigration Studies, the average per-person household income for illegal immigrants is $12,991 — about $15,000 less than that of American citizens. And illegal immigrants account for 9.9 percent of all U.S. residents in poverty.
Also, adding millions of workers to the American job market at a time when unemployment is still perilously high is nothing short of irresponsible. Just to put things in perspective, the version of the DREAM Act that Obama passed as an executive order earlier this year could alone add 1.8 million job seekers to the U.S. market, according to a Fox News report.
Los Angeles’ decision to approve city identification cards is a step in the wrong direction for a state and a nation that needs to fix, not support, the issue of illegal immigration. The mixed message that the card and its services send puts America into a bind that will make it even harder for Congress to effectively control the influx of illegal immigrants.

Who cares what happens to the GOP? The question is what is best for the country. The question is….what is the alternative to comprehensive immigration reform? You really can’t deport everyone. Obama’s cracked down more on illegal immigrants than any other president. As long as you have a country as poor as Mexico (and other Central American states) next to a country as rich as America, you’ll get a pull factor. of course you can toughen up border security, but don’t think that’ll stop it. And you can’t let all of the illegal aliens here just live in this twighlight zone where they are exposed to tremendous abuse, lack any basic rights etc. And you can’t do a Pete Wilson and just not allow them to access even the most basic of services. Clearly we need a DREAM Act which includes a path to citizenship at the very least and possibly something along the lines of the Bush/Kennedy proposal from a few years back. What is clear is that poo-pooing any proposal for reform is not itself an answer. And the author should know that.
Many other rich countries around the world also have an illegal immigration problem. Most of these countries require a national identity card and that has reduced or eliminated the problem in most places.
Any immigration reform should be coupled with a national identity card for all residents. It works.
Meow!
The ’86 amnesty produced about 3 times as many illegal aliens as were estimated.  This time, I’m betting it will be at least 4 or 5 times as many as estimated.  That is roughly another 50-60 million.  The GOP really will be a  thing of the past if they agree to that.

An open letter to USC and UCLA
The crosstown rivalry between our two campuses, particularly in the weeks leading up to the UCLA-USC football game, is a great tradition in college sports.  But even as we root against each other on the field, UCLA and USC stand united in our common belief that this weekend’s game should be a safe, respectful and fun experience for everyone.
UCLA and USC are both world-renowned research universities, equally proud to call Los Angeles home. We ask that Bruins and Trojans alike make a commitment to displaying the very best of the UCLA and USC spirit.  Please remember that while you alone are responsible for your actions, you can set a positive example for others.  Sportsmanship is every bit as important on the field as off.  Respecting those around you demonstrates respect for yourself and for your university.
People all across Los Angeles and the nation will be watching the big game.  We trust all of you to demonstrate the best of what it means to be a Bruin or a Trojan.
So have a great time Saturday.  Go Bruins!  And fight on, Trojans!

USC should ban the sale of soda on campus
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, half of you who are reading this article right now have already consumed, or will consume today, two sugary drinks or sodas.
But don’t take comfort in the fact that you are not alone in your sugary drink consumption. With weight gain, Type 2 diabetes and other health risks on the rise, we should fear that so many of us consume so much soda on a daily basis. It is because of this that I am arguing that it is time for USC to take action on behalf of the health of its students, faculty and staff and ban the sale of soda on its campuses.
According to a September 2012 report by the Organization for Healthy Americans, nearly one quarter of the adult population in California is considered obese today and projections suggest that by 2030, obesity rates will nearly double, to 46.6 percent. The CDC has linked these rising obesity rates — along with rising rates of Type 2 diabetes and heart attacks — to soda.
USC should ban the sale of soda on its campuses because of soda’s link to numerous preventable health risks. Not only should USC be a leader in health awareness and disease prevention, but it should also be invested in helping guide its students, faculty and staff to make healthy decisions that will benefit their health now and in the future.
However, some might argue that such a ban will result in a loss of revenue from soda sales on USC’s campuses and also in some unhappy students, faculty and staff who might view the university administration as an overprotective nanny. But in the end, the benefits of this policy ultimately outweigh the costs. If USC is providing health coverage for its 20,000-plus employees  and providing the option of health care to its 38,000-plus students, it clearly has a vested interest in also looking out for their health. According to the CDC, in 2008, medical costs associated with obesity were estimated at $147 billion, $1,429 higher on a per person basis. This is a burden that organizations such as USC should work to prevent.
Many others have already recognized these overwhelming benefits of a ban on soda: from Boston’s government buildings to New York City. As a premier university and the largest private employer in the city of Los Angeles, USC has the potential to join these locations with a ban on soda and “fight on” at the forefront of developing a healthier city, state, nation and world.
Valor Lee
Senior, communication 
Valor, you are tossing aside the arguments from the other end by stating simply that the “benefits outweigh the costs.” You make the assumption that USC has the right to do this in the first place. A soda ban is absolutely ridiculous, and not just for the revenue loss. As problematic as obesity is in this country, no one’s diet should be dictated to them, thus removing freedom of choice, nor should soda suppliers lose a potential market due to some arbitrary restrictions – what happened to capitalism?
Any ban like this infringes on personal liberty both economically and physically – neither the government nor USC should be allowed to dictate something like this. I agree there is a problem and don’t drink soda myself, but the answer is in education, education to kill the demand of people to drink this stuff in excess, not the supply.
Overall the notion of  “you shouldn’t do this because it’s not good for you” sounds a little Orwellian, don’t you think?
Look, I don’t think UCLA is holding up their end of the bargain on “sportsmanship” and respect for the rivalry by threatening to hold our band off the field during halftime if our drum major stabs their field (which he does everywhere). It’s rather petty. If this is carried out:
1. UCLA will look like complete hypocrites – where will the line be drawn then? No fans allowed from the other schools, lest they say things not agreed with by the home fans *cough* UCLA fans *cough*
2. I hope the USC band plays during UCLA’s halftime show anyway.
Go away, Valor. You’re annoying me. And get your facts straight—reprehensible though Bloomberg’s actions may be, they are far from the ban of sale of soda. I’ll continue to enjoy soda when I feel like it, and I find it unlikely that such a benign habit will result in anything terrible happening to me. There are far less healthy things I could be doing if I felt like it.
Banning the sale of soda is a sham—it benefits no one, even those who legitimately fight for such causes. And nice attempt at a feint by delegitimizing economic incentives for soda to be sold; they’re not relevant here, and your comm classes should have taught you how to frame arguments effectively. Although economics is often useful as a tool, it is not always apt.
