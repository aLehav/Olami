The Pac-12 Conference announced Wednesday that it would part ways with Commissioner Larry Scott. According to the conference’s statement, the Pac-12 and Scott agreed it was time for “new leadership.” Scott will step down officially on June 30, but the conference begins its search for a replacement immediately.
Scott’s contract terminates over a year before its scheduled expiration in 2022. According to the Pac-12, the early dismissal allows Scott to assist in the transition so that the next commissioner is ready for new negotiations on long-term media deals.
“The intercollegiate athletics marketplace doesn’t remain static and now is a good time to bring in a new leader who will help us develop our go-forward strategy,” Pac-12 executive committee member Kirk Shulz said in a statement. 
Scott’s 11-year tenure as commissioner was heavily criticized. Despite signing one of the most lucrative television deals in college sports history — a $3-billion, 12-year deal that almost tripled the conference’s annual television revenue — Scott failed to elevate the position of the Pac-12 and stay competitive with its Power Five peers. 
An Los Angeles Times analysis of public tax documents in 2020 revealed that the Pac-12 had fallen behind the SEC and Big Ten in revenue, reducing the money that the conference could distribute to its schools. This fact was made even worse by Scott’s status as the highest paid Power Five commissioner. 
Scott’s response to the coronavirus lagged in comparison to other conferences. In July, the league announced a revised conference-only schedule only to indefinitely postpone the season shortly afterward. The conference ultimately decided to hold its season in November, but the delay gave teams no leeway to make up for games canceled due to the coronavirus. It also meant that Pac-12 teams had fewer games than their counterparts to make their case for the College Football Playoffs. 
Scott’s tenure was also clouded by reports that he made the conference’s athletic directors feel disenfranchised,by placing them on a need-to-know basis. In September, the Pac-12 secured a deal with Quidel Corporation — a diagnostic healthcare manufacturer that had developed a daily antigen test for the coronavirus that was touted as the key to restarting football — but Scott did not notify the conferences’ athletic directors before announcing the deal, according to the Los Angeles Times.
In light of the criticism, the commissioner still spearheaded deals that proved fundamental to the conference’s identity. Scott oversaw the expansion of the conference to its modern 12-school membership by adding Colorado and Utah. Along with an ESPN and Fox media rights agreement, Scott also established the Pac-12 Network, an independent conference network owned in part by the conference’s universities. 
Scott concludes his tenure in the midst of a dry spell for the conference’s football and basketball programs. The Pac-12 last sent a football team to the CPF in 2016, and only one team has reached the men’s Final Four since 2009.

Junior Andrew Fowler pulled countless all nighters last semester, but not for the same reasons most college students did. It wasn’t because of wild nights or grinding on research papers that Fowler would head to sleep at 9 a.m. — it was because mornings were when he could finally lie down after a 12-hour night shift at Johns Hopkins Hospital. 
Despite being a premed student majoring in pharmacology and drug development with 18 units of coursework, Fowler has been balancing responsibilities as a full-time student and clinical care technician since last March. Having worked in an ER since age 17 and receiving certification as a pharmacy technician, phlebotomist, EMT and nursing assistant in high school, Fowler said he felt responsible to take on the new challenge of working in an intensive care unit after classes transitioned online. 
“I felt an absolute compelling duty to act and interact with, in medicine, patients, during this time when we as the United States and the greater world needed it most,” Fowler said. “So for me, it kind of felt like a natural thing for me to do. There was never a question of ‘Oh, am I going to work during this time?’ ‘There was obviously the risk.’ But that choice, honestly, was never anything that crossed my mind.”
As Fowler started his job at the beginning of the pandemic, he said he watched as the coronavirus spread rapidly throughout the hospital, with specialty intensive care units transitioning to focus entirely on coronavirus cases. He mainly worked in an ICU that specialized in cancer treatment; however, as cases rose, his job as a critical care technician took him to coronavirus units as well, where he served at the frontlines of the pandemic. 
“It’s definitely not something I would take lightly, going to work into a place that’s such a high COVID positive capacity,” Fowler said. “But in the same way, I feel uniquely privileged to be able to interact with the pandemic in this way and play some sort of role in being able to help people and make a difference.” 
While working at the hospital, Fowler had to readjust to a new lifestyle — moving alone to an apartment in Baltimore two hours away from home, avoiding contact with people outside of work and living with incredible discipline for the sake of his patients. Fowler said he ordered all of his groceries with contactless delivery and had to distance from his family and friends for most of his time at Johns Hopkins. 
Fowler’s mother, Amber Gaskill, said she never doubted Fowler’s ability to handle the double workload and to do so safely. She said she never worried too much about her son because “As soon as he set his mind to something that was what he was going to do.”
“When he does something, he does it with everything that he is. He has a passion for things,” Gaskill said. “He could call me when he was at school telling me ‘Oh, mom,I’m gonna do this’ or ‘I’m going to do that,’ and all I could think was ‘How are you managing to do all of these things and also sleep? Are you sleeping?’ … I just knew he would be okay.”
Fowler said that the balancing act was a challenge, but one he was already familiar with as a first-generation low-income student. 
“Anyone from that background could tell you that they are experts in adaptability because we have no choice but to be,” Fowler said. “We never had the ability to just go to school and not work at the same time. It definitely was a lesson in really pushing the bounds in what it meant to be adaptable. I would say I’m lucky, based on my background, to be well suited for the challenge.”
Despite Fowler’s familiarity with flexibility, his semester was no easy feat. As a student, he still had to find time to study for a biochemistry exam or attend meetings as the senior executive advisor to the Undergraduate Student Government president. Fowler said he often scheduled Zoom calls or study time during his meal break or when patients were sleeping. Otherwise, he was on the go, assessing surgical sites, event managing intubated patients and drawing blood. He essentially performed most tasks a nurse would, except for administering medicine, he said. 
“You just have to be scrappy about how you use your time,” Fowler said. 
Cassidy Highsmith, a nurse at Johns Hopkins who became close with Fowler, said she was impressed with how Fowler was able to fulfill his studies and still excel at work. 
“He did so well at doing everything he was supposed to do,” Highsmith said. “He is not only a strong coworker that’s willing to step in, and you can trust that what he’s doing is good work … He’s just always going above and beyond to learn outside of his own scope so that he can be more prepared for what he has to do and for his responsibilities.”
Fowler said one of the hardest parts of life while at Johns Hopkins was distancing from his family for the sake of their and his patients’ safety. Fowler said he became proficient with FaceTime and Zoom calls, and that he found a sense of camaraderie with his coworkers with whom he could share similar struggles.
“We were all going through the same thing, so it was definitely super easy to be able to talk to them,” Fowler said. “It made a lot of the struggles we were facing more real because all of us could talk about it more openly … That definitely brought us closer together.” 
Fowler said some of the hardest days were when he had to help patients and their family members grieve with the end-of-life process or watch patients struggle on life support. He found an outlet in coworkers who could relate to that weight and practiced self-care by squeezing in runs, but he said he also found it helpful to direct his coping towards finding ways to “improve the system itself.”
“[Working so closely with patients and their families] changed my view on end-of-life care and its faults and shortcomings in America, which later prompted me to want to further investigate that and get involved with the policy work surrounding end-of-life care,” Fowler said. “If people were given the opportunity to really define their values and what they value at the end of their life, I think that would change how we as a culture and society view death and dying and medicine during these stages.”
Moving forward, Fowler plans to continue researching more expansive and value centered end-of-life care plans, and intends to go to medical school to become an anesthesiologist or doctor in intensive care. Next semester, he will be working in an emergency room at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he will be able to scale back his work days to once or twice a week and continue as a full-time student. 
“Interacting with medicine during the pandemic, it’s definitely a unique experience,” Fowler said. “It really has given me a chance to be a part of something that’s so much bigger than what I am and what I can singly contribute.”

Amid the coronavirus pandemic and its effects on America’s healthcare system, USC Viterbi Daniel J. Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering Program Director David Belson saw an expedited need for students with an interdisciplinary background in healthcare, public policy and engineering. 
This led Belson, in collaboration with associate professor of clinical medicine Michael Hochman and Associate Dean of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and professor of public policy Lavonna Blair Lewis, to curate a new Master of Science degree program in Health Systems Management Engineering. The first cohort of the three-semester program is planned to enter the program beginning in Fall 2021. 
“When we were planning on this degree, I talked to a CEO of one of the largest hospitals in Southern California,” Belson said. “He said, ‘This is great. This is a great idea. We want to hire these people, if only to train our own people on how to be more productive,’ so there seems to be a pent-up demand for this program.”
While there was a general need for the interdisciplinary training the program offers, Hochman said, the coronavirus may have been the “final spark” that put the program in place. 
“[The coronavirus] certainly highlights the importance of [the program],” Hochman said. “We see what happens when systems don’t work well. No matter how good a doctor you are, if the systems and processes aren’t in place, the care’s not going to get delivered to where it needs to go.”
Administered by the Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering and including courses taught in the Keck School of Medicine and Sol Price School of Public Policy, the degree aims to prepare students to improve the performance and efficiency of hospitals and clinics. 
For Camilia Rowshan, a junior majoring in business administration working with Belson on marketing the program, the degree isn’t just relevant for students interested in engineering, healthcare or public policy. 
“I’m a business student, and from that perspective, just looking at how much money this country has compared to other countries, and seeing at the same time how we handled coronavirus…compared to the amount of resources we have, I think that there is a serious need for restructuring,” Rowshan said. “What we need are people who know how to distribute [resources], know how to go within these systems and make them more efficient.” 
In addition to the courses offered through the three schools, students are required to gain real-world experience through the program by completing capstone projects in major hospitals and healthcare institutions. 
“This is a very applied kind of degree, so while students learn in lectures and textbooks and exams and so on, in this case, it’s relatively easy to find projects for students to do,” Belson said. “[Students] work on improvement projects on problems that the hospital is having. They learn by applying what they’ve learned in the courses, and the hospitals benefit because they need the work done.” 
However, the benefits of the capstone projects aren’t limited just to the students. 
“Students are great for advancing projects that everyone knows are important, but are less urgent or acute in many circumstances,” Hochman said. “I think it could be a mutually beneficial thing for the health system for hospitals and the students.” 
According to Belson, people with this degree can “really have an impact” on the healthcare system, as they work to improve hospital efficiency and tangibly affect people’s lives. 
“We’re starting from rather poor performance, so there’s an opportunity to really have an impact,” Belson said. “It’s kind of worthwhile from a value standpoint.”

In a nearly unanimous vote, USC’s Academic Senate voted in favor of fossil fuel divestment mid-December, following efforts by various student organizations, including the Environment Student Assembly and the student-led environmental campaign DivestSC, to urge the University to divest the $277 million currently in fossil fuel assets. The vote also affirmed the resolutions passed by the Undergraduate Student Government and the Graduate Student Government in early November. 
DivestSC chair Nathaniel Hyman feels that the vote is an additional step in USC’s path to divest from fossil fuels, however, the resolution does not bind the University to any specific method to actually divest. Instead, the vote displays faculty support for the resolution presented by USG and GSG, and places increased pressure on USC’s Board of Trustees to move toward divesting.
Tianna Shaw-Wakeman, an alumna who co-founded DivestSC in 2019, said the vote fits well with the long term goal of DivestSC and other environmental groups on campus, as their efforts have been to unite different sections of USC’s campus under the same goal of divestment. 
“We wanted to make sure that we were touching every single component of the University, so we got support from USG, we got GSG, we now have faculty and we’re working on getting more support from alumni groups,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “So that just shows the Board of Trustees, specifically the Investment Committee, that multiple stakeholders at USC are interested in the same thing.” 
 President of the Academic Senate Paul Adler said the vote was essential to demonstrate the importance of USC facing climate change. 
“[It is] the survival of civilization on this planet,” said Adler, a professor at the Marshall School of Business. “If we don’t do something about climate change, really, really fast, all hell’s going to break loose. And this is just a tiny little contribution to that bigger effort.”
Adler also said the Academic Senate vote is one move among many that faculty members have attempted to make toward encouraging USC to become more sustainability-oriented. In 2019, President Carol Folt formed a Presidential Working Group on sustainability in which faculty, students and staff across the University formulated proposals for long-term sustainability strategy proposals that focused on teaching, research and operations.
“For a long time [it] was a pretty ad hoc group of mainly operations managers … who were interested in seeing USC doing something like this without any mandate having come from above,” Adler said. “So it’s a kind of interesting example of innovation through middle management … it’s not uncommon that new ideas arise in the middle ranks of management who then sell them to senior managers.” 
Hyman said he felt the vote was significant as it displayed faculty support for an effort that had grown in popularity among the student population. However, Hyman said he still believes the University could be more transparent and is unsure of any policy changes to take place following the vote.  
“President Folt has been supportive, she’s met with us numerous times … but we still need the support and communication with other members of the Investment Committee,” said Hyman, a senior majoring in public policy. “We still know nothing … Has there been a change in policy? We don’t know any of that.”
USG Senator Alexis Areias, sponsored the original divestment resolution passed by USG that would serve as a model for the resolution presented to the Academic Senate. Although the Senate’s vote is a step forward to the University’s fossil fuel divestment, Areias, a junior majoring in political science, emphasized that resolutions do not necessarily mean concrete change, and the process for actual divestment is a long one. 
“It’s really difficult for us to make tangible change with these resolutions so it wasn’t necessarily making a direct change, but [USG], as representatives of the student body, are urging the administration … to make these changes,” Areias said. 
For both Hyman and Shaw-Wakeman, they said they believe in the importance of USC students doing their part by making the University and society more environmentally-friendly, whether through looking at one’s own impact on the environment or the different clubs on campus.
“[Students can] bring attention to this, make this something that the University needs to respond to, make it something that’s not ignored for another 10 months,” Hyman said. 
According to a USC media representative, the issue will be discussed in an upcoming Investment Committee meeting.

Through USC’s Young Researchers Program, the laboratories at USC have seen doctoral students paired with budding scientists from local high schools each summer since 2009. Juan Bravo, a doctoral student studying gerontology at USC, got his first lab experience in 2011, after being accepted to the program. That year, he worked alongside a mentor and studied metal concentrations in Mexican candy, but now, in 2021, as a USC gerontology doctoral student and mentor in the program, Bravo’s mentorship experience looks much different in light of the pandemic.
YRP, a free six-week summer program that accepts 12 to 15 local under-represented and low-income rising high school seniors to conduct research alongside a doctoral student, has moved to an online setting. Instead of hands-on research, like Bravo’s project, the program has shifted to a focus on virtual college application help and career panels. 
YRP remains a free program due to the doctoral students who volunteer more than 2,000 hours a year to the program. The doctoral students aim to raise $25,000 through fundraising initiatives to guarantee that YRP is fully funded for one summer. To reduce educational and economic inequalities, the application process does not consider GPA.
Prior to the pandemic, the program included laboratory research, field trips to USC Wrigley Institute at Catalina Island, NASA JPL Laboratory and a new initiative to take the students camping at Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Park where they will learn about geology and ecology firsthand. The program also included talks from the USC Office of Admission or financial aid officers, talks about college life and weekly seminars that highlighted what a career in STEM and the college admission process could look like for the rising seniors. 
Instead of pairing mentors and mentees to a hands-on research project, the program has shifted towards having mentors help students with their college application essays, specifically UC insight questions. The program also added a day dedicated to exploring careers students could pursue in science and providing students an opportunity to hear from different speakers in the field. 
“[We got] people from different careers after [being] in industry and academia [to] come and talk about their experience and what they did to get to where they are,” Ramin Ghoddousi, a doctoral student studying neuroscience, said. “In that group we tried to have people of color as well just because it’s very important to see people that look like you and have had similar experiences.”
Colette Fletcher-Hoppe, a doctoral student studying marine and environmental biology, is the mentor liaison for the program. She is in charge of recruiting other doctoral students as mentors for the program and created a scientific panel for the high school students. 
“We reached out to a bunch of scientific professionals with a wide range of backgrounds and scientific careers, asking them to explain their jobs and what they liked or they didn’t like about their positions and what they did to get into that kind of a career just to expose the students to different career paths that you can have with a biology degree or some kind of a science degree.,” Fletcher-Hoppe said. “Not everyone is going to become a doctor, you can become a policy liaison, you can be involved in government, you can work in industry.”
Shai Porat, a doctoral student studying neuroscience and the director of YRP, started out as a mentor and has been a part of the program since 2017. Porat aims to create a sense of community at YRP, a goal that he has been able to work towards despite the pandemic. 
“I love being a mentor,” Porat said. “I’ve enjoyed interacting with students and making sure that they don’t repeat the mistakes I made going into college, and they also get a more real world sense of what it’s like to apply to college and what to expect out of the college experience as opposed to many programs that just say, ‘Go to college because you need to and then kind of figure it out when you’re there.’”
According to Ghoddousi, the program may continue to be held online in the summer of 2021. 
However, once it is safe to resume in-person interactions, the college essay mentorship will continue as well as bringing in scientists in the field, particularly people of color.
Ghoddousi is the summer coordinator for YRP and is responsible for school outreach in the local Los Angeles area. Ghoddousi said he is passionate about increasing representation of underrepresented communities in the STEM field and hopes that one day the mentees will see more mentors that look like them in the field. 
“I’m very well aware of the disparities in sciences and throughout a lot of the rest of society as to racial and ethnic makeup of different fields,” Ghoddousi said. “So, I wanted to do something about it and I think this is a small way to help, trying to affect the pipeline essentially of high school to grad school and kind of get more representation.”
Thankful for his YRP high school experience as it helped him choose his career path and select USC for graduate school, Bravo encourages other students of diverse backgrounds to engage in mentorship programs. Choosing USC because of the opportunity he saw to become a mentor and potentially make a difference in the community, Bravo said he believes people of a diverse background have a responsibility to serve as a resource to guide underrepresented students. 
“I never had that role model that I could relate to and talk to,” Bravo said. “It’s something that I think, to some degree, people of a diverse background have a responsibility in doing because if we don’t encourage the next generation of potential scientists it just makes it more difficult for them and it makes it more difficult to change the current state of affairs. It’s something that I am really happy and excited to do.”

The Marvel film franchise is well known for giving its superheroes astounding action scenes and heartfelt storylines, as seen in the one of the last major Marvel productions, “Avengers: Endgame.” The movie featured an epic fight scene with half the lives of the universe at stake, as well as gut-wrenching deaths of fan-favorite Avengers. It was a rollercoaster that’s the epitome of everything a Marvel production is expected to be. 
Marvel’s first major crossover onto the smaller screen seems to break from the stereotypical mold present in “Endgame.” Last Friday, Marvel released the first two episodes of “Wandavision” on Disney+. The new series, which follows the Avengers’ Wanda and Vision, sets itself apart from the movies by starting as a sitcom set in the 1960s. The opening episodes’ black-and-white set design starkly contrasts with the super-saturated colors from the other Marvel movies. 
Wanda and Vision present themselves as happy newlyweds who have just moved into their first home in the suburbs. It’s cute and it’s boring. Wanda serves the role of the dutiful housewife: cooking dinner, taking care of the home and meeting the other ladies on the block in her free time. In this perfectly tailored world, Vision heads to the office to work and tries to impress his boss. The lovely couple competes in a talent show and gossips with the other people in the neighborhood. It feels so normal that it’s easy to forget Wanda and Vision are superheroes and should not be living a mundane life in American suburbia. This storyline is a welcomed twist on Tom King’s “Vision” comic books, which sees Vision forced to live in the suburbs and cope with his sadness over not being human.
The show is essentially “The Truman Show” meets “The Dick Van Dyke Show” in an episode of the “Twilight Zone.” 
The first episodes of the show transport the viewer back to an era of laugh tracks and exaggerated acting. It’s a far cry from the action-packed Marvel experiences the typical Marvel fan is accustomed to. However, the episodes, shot and presented as a stereotypical sitcom, hold mystery and allure. 
It works largely because of its suspense.
The episodes continuously hint that there is a deeper, more paramount storyline that will be revealed later on in the season. Before the characters do, the audience learns that Wanda and Vision do not know the basic backstory of their life. (Episode 1, 18:00) Wanda gets hints that there is something abnormal about her reality, such as when she sees color for the first time (episode 2, 7:00) and hears someone calling out to her on the radio, asking if she is OK. (episode 2, 16:00) 
The campy fun of the opening episodes is almost enough to obscure the deep sadness present in “Wandavision.” The world that Wanda and Vision are living in together isn’t real. In “Avengers: Infinity War,” Vision is killed when his life source, the mind stone, is taken from his forehead. In “Endgame,” the infinity stones were destroyed, and with them, any chance of Vision being brought back to life.  
Vision is dead. And Wanda is grieving. She is in this state of limbo, unwilling to move along and let go of Vision. It is unknown whether she created the suburbia the show is set in, but, nevertheless, her desire for normalcy and a stable relationship with her deceased lover keeps her from questioning it too severely. 
The absence of a villain allows Wanda to reject her superpowers and keep living in her peaceful fantasy. In episode two, Wanda steps outside and notices a man walking out of the sewers in a beekeeping costume staring menacingly at her. And instead of lifting her hands to use her magic, Wanda simply says “No.” (episode 2, 28:16). When she does so, the scene resets and Wanda goes back to playing house. She does not want to use her powers to fight and disrupt the normal peaceful life she has now. 
“Wandavision” is a new way of looking at superheroes. It humanizes them. Marvel lets its superheroes come to terms with the awful carnage of their daily lives, just as the average person would need to do. Finally, Marvel is letting its superheroes grieve.

Offering his fans a rare glimpse into his personal life and inner thoughts, British singer-songwriter Zayn released his introspective album “Nobody Is Listening” Jan. 15. 
Initially famous for being a member of the popular boy band One Direction, Zayn became a heartthrob known for his stunning voice and ability to hit high notes. However, after being dissatisfied with One Direction’s pure pop sound, he was the first to leave the band in March 2015 to pursue a solo career. 
Before “Nobody Is Listening,” Zayn’s solo music hit the top charts with tracks such as “PILLOWTALK,” “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” and “Dusk Till Dawn,’’ the latter featuring Sia.
The tone of this new album is right away different from his previous hits. “Calamity,” the first track on the album, immediately surprises. Zayn does not sing initially but, instead, takes to a type of slow rapping that sounds like spoken word poetry. His emotional words are backed by a soft piano. He talks authentically about how his mind can feel like a prison and speaks in many analogies about mental health. “My mind’s in a prism shape / And in times like prison state / There’s no right that I feel of late.” This track references the album’s title, as Zayn sings “nobody is listening to me” in an echoed, lonely fashion.
The tone dramatically shifts in the next track, “Better,” an upbeat love song that discusses a wholesome and healthy relationship. Fans could infer the song refers to supermodel Gigi Hadid, whom Zayn welcomed a baby with in September 2020. The pair have been on-and-off since late 2015 but now seem to be going strong while spending time with family at the Hadid’s farm in New Hope, Pa.
“Outside” presents a more vulnerable track in which Zayn reminisces about residual feelings for an on-and-off-again relationship. He references his ex-partner leaving his belongings outside for him to pick up throughout the song, but he ends the track by suggesting, “let me in.” 
The following track, “Vibez,” brings in strong R&B influences with a steady beat and more risqué themes; it flows smoothly to create a catchy chorus and melody. 
Next is “When Love’s Around,” which grows on the listener with every play. It flows smoothly from “Vibez” with a similar R&B backing. Featuring Syd, a singer formerly part of the bands The Internet and Odd Future, the track starts with a laid-back verse.
Syd sings, “Mm, ever been in love? / Ever really loved someone? / People tend to rush / People tend to run to love / Only takes a woman / To show you what it means to love, love.”
As one song flows to another, “Connexion” features more raw vocals, displaying the upper-octave runs that Zayn is best at. The lyrics reference a reconnection in Zayn’s life as he sings, “It’s like a force we can’t explain / Work like a magnet.” The track is an homage to R&B as the vocals would likely be considered too raw for pop.
“Sweat” brings back more sensual lyrics and a more produced, percussion-heavy sound. This track is reminiscent of Nick Jonas’s rebellious era that brought songs like “Close” to the fore. 
Zayn exudes confidence and contentment in “Unf***witable.” He references leaving fake people behind as he matures and becomes almost untouchable in his attitude: “So tired of fake friends and fake love, you know / No time for no lie and I’m here to show / I found a way higher.”
“Windowsill” utilizes autotune more than tracks such as “Connexion,” but its usage seems intentional as his vocals stand on their own. This song could be considered intense but poppy. British rapper Devlin’s verse is a little unexpected but fits this song better than any track on the album. Zayn singing, “that’s the way you show me love,” shows an emotional contrast. 
“Tightrope” was a personal favorite as it provides a more melodic alternative where Zayn comes across as genuine and vulnerable, singing, “Something told me it was you.” He utilizes more acoustic and creates a more chill version of a Bazzi song. 
The album finishes off with the best track on the album: “River Road.” It is beautifully soulful and impeccably shows off Zayn’s talented vocals and vibrato. The tone is more melancholy but builds with the use of an electric guitar. Some of the best lyrics include “We don’t define each other / Stand on your own, be a pillar” and “To till the truth, I’m tired of falling / When I’m floating, I’m closer to you.”
Overall, this album is a worthy listen, and with a couple of replays through, fans are sure to find emotional and more surprising R&B ballads that they can resonate with and vibe to in 2021.

A lot happened since I last talked about sports continuing during the pandemic. The most important development being that vaccinations are now finally being administered across the country. Although vaccine distribution has been slow and there are many more months before it is widely available to the general public, it looks like the United States is heading into the final lap against pandemic. 
This means that leagues should not be relaxing their coronavirus precautions, but instead should be doubling down on their efforts to protect the players and staff as well as their cities.
One example of a league that is starting to be less strict is the NBA, which isn’t a great look since they were previously the gold-standard of finishing a professional sports season during a pandemic.
The NBA’s bubble system — a strategy in which all players participating in the continued season resided within a designated campus in Walt Disney World, which also hosted all of their games — proved to be a major success. Even though ratings were lower than usual, it demonstrated that there was a cautious and effective way to play sports during the pandemic. Meanwhile, other leagues had to cancel and postpone games or force teams to play at a disadvantage. For example, the Denver Broncos had to start a practice-squad wide receiver at quarterback due to a coronavirus outbreak within the team. 
The reality of the bubble being recreated for the entirety of the 2020-21 NBA season was unrealistic. It wasn’t feasible for the NBA to force staff and players to stay at one location again for an extended period of time. Additionally, the league and its teams have to think about revenue, and so by hosting games again at their home stadiums, they can recoup some of the earnings lost from the inability to allow fans at games. 
However, without the security of the bubble, the NBA has fallen into the same circumstances as its professional counterparts. The same league that forced a player to go into quarantine 10 days for picking up a food delivery is now okay with Kyrie Irving, who was seen maskless at a birthday party last weekend, becoming available to play this Monday. 
While Irving ultimately didn’t take the court, it wasn’t out of a lack of caution, it was due to a lack of conditioning. The NBA seems like it’s now back in it for the ratings and are prioritizing attracting viewers over players’ health. 
Consequently, it shouldn’t be surprising that teams with one coronavirus case quickly had an outbreak on their hands. For instance, the Philadelphia 76ers had to play a game with only eight players because of coronavirus precautions and injuries affecting the team. Obviously, this ended up having an effect on their 115-103 loss to the Denver Nuggets because an eight-man squad will inevitably become exhausted.
In the case where there are not enough players available because of coronavirus protocols, the league has responded by simply postponing games to later dates. As of now, 15 games have already been postponed. Considering the NBA season has already been shortened because of the coronavirus, postponing games doesn’t look like the best option moving forward.
On the same note, the NBA’s college counterparts have not been doing the greatest job either. Take our own university, for example. The USC men’s basketball team, who had an amazing six-game winning streak, also had some trouble at the start of the season because three games were postponed or canceled. This issue has hurt many other teams as well across the NCAA. Despite the strict coronavirus protocols and testing procedures by these schools, the virus is still wreaking havoc. 
Thankfully, the NCAA is planning in advance and will have March Madness take place predominantly in Indianapolis with some other games played in the same state. So, once tournament time comes in a couple of months, there will be less travel and hopefully less virus transmission. The tournament’s containment to Indiana greatly reduces the risk of community and travel viral spreading and hopefully means its games can be limited to a month long schedule.
Once the playoffs arrive for the NBA, the association should follow the NCAA’s lead. Usually, it’s assumed that the collegiate level would follow its professional counterpart. But, now the reverse seems true.
The current government outlook suggests that “mid-summer” is the most realistic timeline for the general public to receive vaccinations — right around when the NBA playoffs are happening. It is possible that players and staff can get vaccinated so that the bubble system would not have to be as strict, but we need to wait and see. 
Even though vaccinations appear to be on their way, the virus is still very much present and the sports world should not start relaxing its protocols just because it is a new year. The NBA set the standard on how sports should be played in the United States during the pandemic. Now, they need to maintain proper and safe protocols so that teams and their local communities stay safe.

USC’s 2021 recruiting class isn’t complete yet — the regular signing day period doesn’t begin until February 3 — but after wrapping up an exceptional early signing day period, which officially ended December 16, there is a lot for Trojan fans to be excited about. According to 247Sports, USC’s 2021 recruiting class currently ranks No. 8 nationally and No. 2 in the Pac-12, a far cry from the previous year, when the Trojans’ recruiting class ultimately finished No. 64 nationally and dead-last in the conference. 
In light of the program’s recruiting turnaround and seeming return to national prominence, here is a look at the top five recruits in USC’s 2021 class thus far. (All rankings were retrieved from 247Sports composite rankings).
Korey Foreman, fivestar defensive end 
The importance of Foreman’s (Corona, Calif.) commitment to USC is impossible to understate. Following the disappointment that was the Trojans’ 2020 recruiting cycle, the program beefed up its recruiting staff and revamped much of its recruiting infrastructure to ensure that its slide in prominence didn’t become a regularity. Landing Foreman sends the message that the program is back on track and worthy of attracting top-talent from across the country again. Perhaps most importantly, however, it’s a key step towards reclaiming the program’s recruiting dominance in California, a strategy USC has dubbed, “Take Back the West.” It’s been five years since the Trojans last secured California’s top recruit. 
Though much of the commentary following Foreman’s commitment has centered on the symbolic importance of the defensive end’s decision, fans shouldn’t forget that Foreman projects to be an early impact player for the Trojans next season. Standing at 6’5 and 255 lbs, Foreman possesses a well distributed frame, elite quickness, and is considered a technician on the defensive line. Those qualities — which have led some analysts to forecast Foreman as a future No.1 NFL draft pick — will likely serve him well next season, when he presumably bookends USC’s defensive front along with former teammate sophomore Drake Jackson. 
Miller Moss, four-star quarterback
Moss (Mission Hills, Calif.) is the No. 71 recruit in the nation and the No. 5 player in California. He’s a pure pocket passer with one of the quickest releases in the country, good arm strength and exceptional accuracy. He also spurned Alabama, LSU and cross-town rival UCLA to sign with USC, which represented a major recruiting victory for the Trojans. 
Unlike Foreman, Moss isn’t expected to see the field next season, with sophomore Kedon Slovis projected to lead USC’s offense again after a productive 2020 campaign. However, Slovis will be draft-eligible after next season, and all signs are pointing to a battle to succeed Slovis between Moss and the only other quarterback on this list, Jaxson Dart. 
Ceyair Wright, four star cornerback 
Wright (Los Angeles, CA) is the only recruit on this list who has yet to officially sign with USC, but his commitment to the Trojans is a hard one. He’s the No. 6 cornerback in the country and the No. 8 recruit in the state of California. Like Foreman and Moss, Wright’s commitment also represents the fulfillment of USC’s efforts to “Take Back the West.”
At 6’1, Wright has the ideal frame and lengthy build necessary to play man-to-man at the college level. Wright also possesses elite speed, as evidenced by the 10.84 100 meter-dash he clocked as a junior on his state-winning 4×100 relay team. Given the likelihood that USC’s secondary will be much less experienced next season than it was this past season — the result of the junior cornerback Olaijah Griffin and junior safety Talanoa Hufanga declaring for the draft — Wright appears poised to be an early contributor to the Trojans’ defense. 
Jaxson Dart, four-star quarterback
Unlike other recruits on this list, Dart (Draper, Utah) was not a recruiting commodity prior to the 2020 high school season. In fact, as of last September, Dart didn’t have a single Power Five offer and wasn’t even ranked by 247Sports composite rankings until October. His meteoric recruiting rise is largely due to the fact that during the 2020 season, Dart threw for 67 touchdowns, a Utah state-record and more than 3-times his total from any previous season, and 4691 yards, almost double his total from any previous season, on his way to winning his third straight Utah state-championship. 
The stats don’t appear to be a fluke either. Dart, a pocket passer, possesses prototypical size for his position at 6’3, 210lbs. He also demonstrated excellent vision last season while flashing all the necessary intangibles to succeed at the college level. His arm strength isn’t lacking either, as evidenced by his previously mentioned stat line. With Slovis likely to head to the NFL after next season, fans should expect a quarterback battle between Dart and Moss to become USC’s next starter under-center. 
Julien Simon, four star outside linebacker
Simon (Tacoma, Wash.) is the No. 119 overall prospect and No. 4 recruit in the state of Washington. Perhaps no word sums up Simon’s skill set better than versatile. Simon played running back, wide receiver, linebacker and safety during his junior season and managed to find the end zone multiple times on both sides of the ball. Though he offers production and potential on offense, he projects as a linebacker at the college level, a position he’s already slated to play at USC. 
When playing linebacker his junior season, Simon showed off excellent ball skills, an ability to cover running backs, tight ends and receivers and a knack for getting into the backfield and stuffing the ball-carrier. Fans should expect him to be a playmaker whenever he eventually finds his way onto USC’s starting defense.

Long before she stepped onto campus, Valerie Narumi, a senior majoring in neuroscience, already had an idea in mind on how to get involved. 
She wanted to continue volunteering at local hospitals as she had done in Orange County through middle and high school, rolling her piano keyboard on wheels within each building and playing for patients in those facilities. 
Upon being accepted to USC, Narumi realized that the University did not exactly have the type of organization she was looking for that allowed for volunteers to play music in hospitals.
Forgoing disappointment, Narumi took the initiative by reaching out to the patient experience department at Keck Hospital. She held conversations with them about potentially forming a program where people are able to go inside the facility and play music, to which the hospital excitedly said yes. 
After a summer of planning, Narumi’s first few weeks of the Fall 2017 semester were spent registering and attending required meetings to formally recognize the organization. When all the paperwork was signed and settled, Narumi had founded Medicinal Music Makers. 
According to Narumi, Medicinal Music Makers is an organization dedicated to spreading  music’s healing powers to patients, families and medical staff. 
“When you go to the hospital it’s usually very, very quiet, and very desolate … And if me or any of the musicians [go] there … and just play something, even in the background, and if even one patient or doctor is able to have a little bit of a better day because of it, I think that would be the main purpose of this organization,” Narumi said.
Prior to the coronavirus limiting many in-person activities, Medicinal Music Makers would guide volunteers by signing them up for the Keck Hospital onboarding process, including standard training, health screenings and background checks. Afterward, Medicinal Music Makers would schedule volunteers to play music, such as performing piano in the Keck Hospital atrium for about an hour. For people who were still interested yet don’t play music, the organization created opportunities for them to help make sure that everything is running smoothly. 
Due to the coronavirus, the volunteer services at Keck Hospitals have been suspended indefinitely. In order to continue bringing music to hospitals, Narumi reorganized the organization.
“So over summer, I came up with the idea to do a virtual concert where people can send in video or audio performances of theirs,” Narumi said. “And we’ll culminate into like a one 30-minute video that go up every other week. 
According to Narumi, anyone is able to send in a performance of theirs that they’d like to share, no matter how old the video. That’s how Tracy Wong, a first-year doctoral student studying piano performance and now co-communications director, first got involved with the organization. 
Apart from wanting to be involved within the University, the messaging and mission of Medicinal Music Makers is what drew Wong in. Wong received her bachelor’s in psychology and piano performance from Oberlin College, so the connection between music, science and the healing arts has been important to her. However, as she pursued her master’s degree in piano performance, Wong was not able to explore her other interests.
“So coming [to USC] because I know obviously, the Keck School of Medicine is huge at USC, I was already on the lookout for something that would satisfy that itch to connect the two things in my life, so [Medicinal Music Makers] was perfect,” Wong said. 
As a piano teacher, Wong has also seen firsthand how music has been able to assist others. 
“I’ve had students who have come to me who are living with Parkinson’s. And after an hour or two hours of a lesson and focusing attention on these minute details that they’re playing with their fingers, that tactile action actually helps a lot with Parkinson’s disease. And the shakes are noticeably better for like the day after a lesson or something like that,” Wong said. 
For Antoinette Perry, the faculty advisor of Medicinal Music Makers, being a part of the organization has shown her a lot about the healing powers of music.
“I always knew [music] provided healing to the soul that I didn’t realize that it also aids in healing the physical body so that was a big surprise to me,” Perry said. 
Even while virtual, Wong is glad that the organization is still able to serve its purpose. As view counts on the videos go up, indicating that people are watching and listening, Wong appreciates that the videos can “bring a little bit of levity and a little bit of beauty into people’s lives.”
“I think that that feeling is only going to grow, because I’ve only gotten like a virtual version of it. I think it’s going to be increasing tenfold when we’re all back in person and we’re able to actually bring our performers into the hospital as volunteers and watch people’s reactions live and give them a little bit of our time like that,” Wong said.
According to Wong, the group has been in talks of continuing the virtual concerts in addition to in-person performances. Kenneth Cunanan, a first-year graduate student studying biomedical engineering and the co-communications director of Medicinal Music Makers, hopes to one day experience how it felt like to be at the hospital in-person. So far, though, Cunanan has enjoyed being in the group as it functions now. 
“We have a pretty good sense of camaraderie. I think we mesh well together, and we’re pretty welcoming for new members and current members,” Cunanan said. 
Overall, Perry describes the organization as a reminder to music students of what their purpose is in studying music. 
“Sometimes we lose sight of that when we spend so many hours in the practice room, and we’re just thinking of ourselves, and how good we’re gonna get,” Perry said. “And it’s very gratifying for them to see how gratifying it is to be able to improve the lives of others and to be able to bring beauty into the world.”

The events that recently took place in our nation’s capital were a clear display of how elevated political discourse has been ripping through the fabric of our democracy. The fall of a peaceful transition of presidential power and what was once the model of democratic practice is not only embarrassing, but also incredibly alarming. 
It’s important to note that a part of the crowd marching included citizens protesting on Capitol grounds without violence, utilizing their right to protest against what they believed was an unfair and rigged election. However,  those who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6 were neither part of a “protest” or “demonstration” but an unlawful, violent mob.
Compare these scenes to the Black Lives Matter protests last summer: The wrongful deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and many others resulted in many peaceful demonstrations, a few of which sadly turned violent due to either individuals taking advantage of the situation or an inappropriate and harmful police response. 
So whichever crowd your political beliefs align with, it is undoubtedly clear that differences in law enforcement response and media coverage illustrate a terrifying disparity; sadly nothing new yet another example of the racial and social hierarchies which persist in this country. 
When analyzing the rhetoric used by news organizations to report the siege, the lack of consistent wordage becomes starkly evident. Depending on the reporter and script writer, headlines and articles varied significantly on how they labeled the crowd. Some CNN articles cited them as “domestic terrorists,” while The Wall Street Journal referenced the same group as “extremists.” In great contrast, Fox News could barely admit the Capitol siege was a newsworthy story, giving the event no more than a title of a “march.”  
As a publication reporting on these issues that directly affect the USC community, the Daily Trojan continues to prioritize awareness and empathy as we write on sensitive topics. 
Reporting on both topics takes language, rhetoric and tone that remains unbiased and upholds accuracy. It is our responsibility to recognize and adapt to the evolving social landscape, regularly changing and updating our style guide to properly address every member within and affiliated with the USC community. Our writers perform lengths and strides beyond due diligence, making an effort to cover all of the bases with each and every article, speaking to individuals outside of the immediate USC community and researching counterarguments. 
Being members of the Copy section, we are often the behind-the-scenes team with every article or piece of media you digest from the Daily Trojan. We’ve picked out subtle grammatical errors in the latest breaking-news piece, fact-checked every line of your favorite column, and painstakingly listened to interviews to confirm quotes. But most importantly, we’ve ensured the presence of the correct word choice when reporting stories.
We’ve made great strides this past semester copy-wise to properly cover Black and Indigenous people and people of color along with members of the LGBTQ+ community. We hope to continue this onset of diverse terminology in reporting on other sensitive issues such as mental health or disability. 
It could simply be said that these subtle changes in word choice are meaningless — a product of “political-correctness” or the “snowflake” liberal culture that pervades college campuses. However, our responsibility as copy editors is not one rooted necessarily in such lighthearted, gleeful ideas but in upholding the respect and dignity of this institution and its members. It is our job to accurately and fairly  represent and shine light on individuals, organizations and events referenced in articles. 
That’s not to say we’ve been perfect either. There have been many times where our writers may feel their voices filtered out through what we may see as grammatical and word choice edits. Our lack of coverage on some events may too rightfully frustrate members of our USC community. Misprints and failures to properly account for inaccurate storytelling also plague the minds of editors and writers alike. These mistakes, along with many others, are inexcusable in the newsroom, and we have full intentions on improving our work into the spring semester. 
As our nation too moves forward, we will continue to cover the events both at the national and community levels. Unpredictability and change will not phase us, and we are proud to welcome new and returning staff members to the copy team at our publication, ensuring accuracy and readability for articles on thought-provoking, current issues. Similarly, we plan to strive for unbiased publications that encompass all the issues within and outside of the USC community. Despite all the randomness of the world, we will continue to fact-check, edit and represent the news, as it’s not only our responsibility but also a privilege to serve as chiefs of the copy section.

Many movements and political stances use language as a powerful tool to both legitimize their cause and counter any opposition. Although it may seem unimportant what type of language certain groups use, in actuality, language use is very tactical.
One of the most notable examples of this is the pro-life movement. The phrase “pro-life” is very purposeful in that it villainizes the pro-choice movement by implying that pro-choice means “anti-life.” Although this is not the case, this language use is made to depict the pro-choice movement in a negative light to those who may not know what the idea of choice means in its totality. 
By using this language, the pro-life movement — to the bare eye — would seem to be the group who has the moral high ground, when in reality, most (not all) people who are pro-life do not take steps to protect lives past those of unborn babies. In reality, this idea of being in favor of “life” does not accurately represent what this movement is but is instead a tactical move to use particular language to change the perception of these contrasting movements. 
In order to delegitimize the perception of the pro-life movement as being the morally correct option and the pro-choice movement being the villain against life, there needs to be a shift in language use regarding this movement. The phrase “pro-life” does not encompass what this group stands for, thus using antithesis-based language to describe the movement. Using language like “anti-choice” is a valid step toward delegitimizing and unravelling the perception this group created when using tactical, life-affirming language. 
This is not the only case in which language use drastically generalizes and harms specific groups. Oftentimes, hate targeted toward the LBGTQ+ community is generalized to be homophobic which erases the harm targeted toward non-gay, but still queer community members. On top of this, the idea of having a “phobia” and using that language to describe anti-LBGTQ+ hate is harmful within itself. 
Similar to the villainization of the pro-choice movement by using the language pro-life, decribing anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric as homophobic creates a perception that being against the LGBTQ+ community is a “phobia” or fear. This legitimizes anti-LBGTQ+ rhetoric as a “valid fear” and helps hide hate. The only way to expose the hate which is being sheltered by language like “homophobic” is to similarly antithesize the movement using language like anti-LBGTQ+ which not only encompasses hate targeted toward queer idenities, but also counters the idea that being against gay people is a fear as implied by the suffix “phobia.” 
In both instances, the language chosen to encompass a movement or idea is used to hide hate and create an inaccurate perception of certain social movements. In order to combat these perceptions and create a universal, accurate understanding of what each group is in favor of or against, there needs to be a shift in how these movements are described. Using antithesis-based language to decribe hateful movements, like using anti-choice instead of pro-life and anti-LGBTQ+ instead of homophobic, is not only more accurate, but unveils the hate and inaccuracies that are hidden within the original language used.

Picture this: Twenty years from now, the next generation of high school students unveil their AP U.S. History Exam. The free response section projects a simple screenshot of a digital screen. Donald J. Trump. 45th President of the United States. Twitter account suspended. 
The question may ask students to analyze every moment leading up to this decision by the social media company: the unprecedented outcome of the 2016 election, the Trumpism movement, the first impeachment trial, the 2020 election and finally, the atrocious — yet totally predictable, if you ask me — domestic terrorist attacks on the Capitol. 
How did we get here? 
Since the suspension of Trump’s Twitter account, the conversation surrounding free speech has resurfaced, particularly with the trending hashtag “1984IsHere.” However, this application of the term “Orwellian” to our society becomes complicated when considering the history behind “1984” and Orwell’s purpose in writing it: to warn against totalitarianism on both sides of the political spectrum. 
Blatantly, Twitter’s ban of Trump’s account does not parallel an Orwellian society by any means. While approaching modern political strife, we must refocus our application of Orwell’s warning. 
Originally published in 1949, George Orwell’s “1984” encapsulates a dystopian society overrun by a totalitarian overlord, “Big Brother,” where “Thought Police” monitor citizens’ psyches and arrest dissenters. After its publication, the right and left wings raced to apply the novel’s meaning in the context of the political climate. 
Orwell, a self-proclaimed Democratic socialist, wrote the novel while fighting against Francoist fascism as part of the Workers’ Party of Marxist Unification in the Spanish Civil War. However, Stalinist forces turned against the POUM, and Orwell found himself in the middle of left wing and ring wing totalitarianism. As an anti-Stalinist, Orwell ultimately wrote “1984” as a warning against totalitarianism on both sides of the political spectrum — Stalin’s communist state in Russia and Franco’s fascist rule in Spain. 
Contemporarily, we are again experiencing a race to claim the meaning behind “1984.” The right wing throws around “Orwellian” to argue against “communism,” or at least against their own perception of leftist ideologies. The left wing uses it to denounce the fascist tendencies of the GOP. 
Particularly, opinions surrounding free speech follow a paradigm of weaponizing dystopian classics, whether it be Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451,” Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World” or “1984” in this case. These repetitive arguments nearly always circle back to censorship as a trademark of nightmare societies like in “1984.” For example, the GOP uses “Orwellian” to describe Trump’s Twitter ban as an infringement on the right of free speech. This also happens when universities block conservative speakers like Ben Shapiro. 
However, these arguments dismiss the reasons behind these bans. Expressing your opinion on Twitter or speaking at a university are not guaranteed rights. Twitter is a social media platform that has user guidelines, and Trump violated these by inciting an insurgency. Ben Shapiro’s radical ideology provokes hate against marginalized communities particularly vulnerable to violence. Trump can still exercise his right of free speech through other platforms, as can Ben Shapiro.  
Simply put, these lazy freedom of speech arguments misinterpret the meaning behind “1984.” In this country, the remnants of McCarthyism permeate deeply — Americans instantly equate communism and socialism to Stalinism. We live in an age of misinformation, where politicians cannot develop a platform beyond mislabeling their opponent as a “socialist” — President Joe Biden and the “radical left.”
In fact, according to the political compass, Hilary Clinton and Trump, a prominent Democrat and Republican respectively, are both closer to the far right than the far left. Comparing this to a universal political spectrum, Democrats and Republicans are both closer to ideologies like fascism than they are to ideologies like socialism. The United States is a capitalist state, and U.S. centrists repeatedly deem left wing ideology, such as that of Democratic socialists, as too radical. Universal health care, a staple of almost every other developed nation, remains a dream in the nightmare of people unable to afford insulin. 
However, as fascist nations do, we still control the reproductive health of women. We still execute inmates on federal death row. Congress booed Rep. Cori Bush for condemning white supremacy during Trump’s second impeachment trial. If we want to talk about “1984,” these tendencies are closer to totalitarianism than holding violent fascists accountable for condoning white supremacy. 
More than three decades have passed since 1984. It’s time to progress toward a different future where we need not be reminded of the nightmares that the Capitol terrorist attacks exposed. Otherwise, our society will continue to haunt us.
