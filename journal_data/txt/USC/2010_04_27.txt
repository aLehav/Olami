Spring practice comes to a close Saturday with the Spring Football Game at the Coliseum, but that doesn’t mean the team is done making changes.
Game changers · Assistant head coach Monte Kiffin is molding Devon Kennard from the defensive line into the linebacking corp.  - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
In the last practice in pads this school year, junior linebacker Chris Galippo moved from his natural middle linebacker position to outside linebacker to make room for sophomore Devon Kennard.
Galippo got about 15 to 20 snaps in at outside linebacker and said the move from the position he’s played his whole life didn’t feel weird.
“Mentally, outside linebacker is a lot easier than middle,” Galippo said. “You don’t have to worry about making the checks. When I’m in there, I trust Devon to make the strength calls and the checks. “
Other features of the position gave Galippo a new feeling for playing in the system.
“I like that you get a lot of space and you’re kind of on the edge,” Galippo said. “You can take a look at the formation and rush a whole lot more … I kind of felt like I was on vacation and I could just go out there and play.”
Defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin is trying to work Kennard, a defensive end last year, into the linebacking rotation and Kennard has easily been one of the best linebackers on the field this spring. Kiffin told Galippo yesterday about his move to outside linebacker and said he chose him because of his experience.
“I completely understand. Coach Monte said he wants the three best linebackers on the field and if this is what we got to do — being the older linebacker I completely understand it,” Galippo said. “It’s a lot for Devon to go from defensive end to learning middle linebacker and if he were to go then learn outside linebacker… I can handle it.”
Galippo’s not sure what the coaching staff has in store for him beyond Saturday and doesn’t know if he’s going to be playing both middle and outside linebacker. He said he’s “absolutely fine” if Kennard is put atop the depth chart when it comes out on Friday for the spring game.
USC coach Lane Kiffin warned to put little stock in what appears on the spring game depth chart, however.
“We’ll have something on Friday but that’s pretty much in pencil,” Kiffin said. “It’s just something for [the media] to have Saturday. There will still be a lot of work in between that and the final one. Saturday will matter obviously and going back through all the stuff throughout the 15 practices.”

The wide receiver corps looks like it will be thin for the spring game. With senior David Ausberry moving over to tight end and redshirt junior Brandon Carswell and sophomore De’von Flournoy injured, the corps was already low on bodies.
Then there’s senior Ronald Johnson, who spent the majority of practice catching punts but didn’t participate in any receiver drills because of a wrist and elbow injury.
“It’s still questionable about whether he will need wrist surgery. It looks like he won’t now, but he still can’t play because of his elbow sprain,” Kiffin said.
This gave senior Travon Patterson and redshirt sophomore Brice Butler a chance to play a lot yesterday as the team practiced swing passes, wheel routes and bubble screens.
“Travon Patterson made some plays and it’s good to see Brice Butler playing better and really playing physical,” Kiffin said. “We need him to step up. He’s got potential to be a No. 2 or No. 3, but he’s got to be more consistent.”

Continuing with the injury theme that has been a storyline this spring, redshirt sophomore linebacker Nick Perry left midway through practice with a left knee injury. Also, junior tight end Blake Ayles suffered his second concussion of the spring season over the weekend and will miss the remainder of practice.

On a sunny Friday afternoon, when many students sleep in until 2 p.m., a few Trojans choose to trek to El Segundo, Calif., and shut themselves in a frigid ice rink.
Expression · Freshman Michelle Hanabusa joined the USC Figure Skating Club after training in showcase skating, which focuses on artistry. - Candice Harbour | Daily Trojan 
Founded by senior Lesley Wasserman and sophomore Jessica Houston in spring 2009, members of the USC Figure Skating Club spend their practice session polishing jumps and spins. It shares the rink with a few scattered younger skaters and coaches at the Toyota Sports Center, the same rink where the L.A. Kings hockey team and Olympic figure skater Evan Lysacek train.
They even have an unofficial coach — Tiffany Chin, the first Asian-American national champion and the woman Houston calls her second mother.
Houston, who is studying international relations (global business), hopes to expand the club into a team that competes with other collegiate skating clubs. Schools like UCLA have well-established teams that travel.
“We have six to eight members who are committed, but because skating is so hard — we have no rink on campus — and because we’re so new, we have a lot of floater members,” Houston said of the club.
In an effort to raise funds for future competition expenses, uniforms and coaching fees, the team holds ice skating fundraisers where USC students can skate for fun.
“Skating is very expensive,” Houston said.
A Boston native, Houston competed nationally and internationally in Slovenia, Poland and France until the end of her freshman year at USC. She no longer skates the three hours a day, six days a week she did in high school, but wants to keep skating a part of her future. She even teaches skating lessons at an ice rink in Pasadena, Calif.
“When I first got into USC, I was trying to defer to pursue skating,” she said. “I never had the time to really just skate before. But the opportunity to go to USC was just too great.”
She doesn’t plan to go back into competition after school.
“I don’t think that’s possible. Skating demands so much … and is so demanding on your body,” she said.
Fellow club member Michelle Hanabusa, a freshman studying fine arts with an emphasis in design, also came to college with skating on her mind. A showcase skater hailing from Palos Verdes, Calif., Hanabusa took part in events that emphasized artistry over technical moves, such as jumps, and she came back to skating a year after hip surgery.
“I don’t miss the competition, I just miss the whole performance aspect of doing programs,” she said with a reluctant smile. “I would like just to have little competitions with other schools. It would be fun.”
The tiny, bubbly freshman also teaches at an ice rink in Torrance, Calif.
The two might claim to be out of shape, but on the ice, they still glide with grace and power.
Houston still zooms across the ice and whips out salchow after salchow, jumping like a pretty spring, her neat bun bobbing up and down as she jumps and lands while the rink streams pop radio over the P.A. system.
Hanabusa spends her session working on layback spins; where she  arches and kicks up her foot in an arabesque, spinning like a dancer in a music box. Her signature trick, however, is her spiral, a sweeping move where she glides on one foot while her working leg is raised far above hip level in an elegant line.
They’re also joined by Justin Tse, a junior majoring in business administration. Although he stopped skating in high school because he did not have enough time to train, he joined the club to get back into it.
“I was browsing through the clubs list,” Tse said of his decision to join at the beginning of the 2009-2010 school year. He now keeps company with the athletes he grew up watching and admiring — artists such as Michelle Kwan and Kristi Yamaguchi.
And although it’s been years since he was in full practice, he goes out and practices his favorite move: a sit spin. He plans on returning to the sport at his home rink in San Francisco in the summer.
Houston continued practice by flying into spins. Across the rink, Hanabusa works on her Y-spiral, holding her leg to the sky as she glides backwards in a long curve across the ice, all while Rihanna’s “Rude Boy” blasts on the speakers.
The three weave in and out of each other’s paths; making the soft swish of blades against ice, their shirts rippling as they streamed past one another.
They have viewers, too. Hanabusa’s mother, Shinko, watches from the sidelines with camcorder in tow.
She still feels pride for her daughter.
“She still challenges herself,” Shinko Hanabusa said of Michelle Hanabusa. “She just has a positive mind about skating. She has a happy face … a spirit. [Skating] is her way of expression,” she said, beaming with pride.
It is the club’s hope that Hanabasu’s competitive personality will get a chance to show off their love for flips, split jumps and sit spins to other skating clubs ­— all while sharing their art with the USC community.

Last week USC rallied, scoring nine unanswered runs against UC Santa Barbara’s bullpen to slip by 9-8 at Dedeaux Field.
Tuesday, the Gauchos (18-17) got their revenge as the roles were reversed in UCSB’s 5-4 win at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.
Focused · Sophomore first baseman Ricky Oropesa was the only Trojan to have more than one hit on Tuesday while also drawing a walk. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans (17-23, 3-12) fell to 4-11 in their last 15 games after allowing an early lead to slip away. The Gauchos used the long ball and a stellar performance from their bullpen, allowing only three hits in eight innings, to knock the Trojans off.
USC jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead in the first inning. Senior centerfielder Mike O’Neill opened the game with a double to right-centerfield followed by a soft single to centerfield from junior shortstop Joe De Pinto. Sophomore first baseman Ricky Oropesa drove in the game’s first run when his single to right field scored O’Neill and advanced De Pinto to third base.
The Trojans then got tricky, scoring a run on a double-steal of home to make the score 2-0. Sophomore right fielder Alex Sherrod, in his return from a four-game suspension after being ejected for intentionally throwing at an Arizona State batter, added a RBI single scoring Oropesa.
Sherrod came around to score later in the inning on a bases loaded single by senior centerfielder Kevin Roundtree, but O’Neill was unable to add to the lead, grounding out to pitcher Greg Davis to end the inning.
Unfortunately for the Trojans, Davis didn’t return to the mound the second inning. Instead, USC ran into a four-man buzz saw. UCSB relievers Matthew Brady, Sam Phippen, Connor Whalen and Nick Loredo held the Trojans scoreless for the final eight innings.  Whalen recorded the win.
The USC offense essentially shut down after the first inning, recording only three hits in the final eight frames. But the Trojans weren’t without opportunities — they had runners reach base in every inning but the eighth.
USC left the bases loaded in the third inning, stranded a pair of runners in scoring position in the sixth inning and couldn’t capitalize on a leadoff double by freshman Cade Kreuter in the seventh inning.
While the Trojans were sputtering offensively, UCSB combined four hits with a pair of USC errors in the third inning to cut the lead to 4-2 on a pair of unearned runs off USC junior starter Logan Odom.
The Gauchos jumped on senior reliever Shuhei Fujiya the next inning, tying the game on a Gunnar Terhune two-run homer to left field.
It was another big fly that proved to be the difference. In the seventh inning, UCSB outfielder Ryan Tregoning hit a solo home run to left field off southpaw reliever Brad Douthit.
The loss drops USC to 7-2 in midweek contests this season. The Trojans return to Dedeaux Field to open a weekend series with Pac-10 foe No. 19 Arizona at 6:30 p.m. on Friday.

A lot of things are coming to an end this week.
Classes are done Friday. Spring football ends with the spring game at the Coliseum on Saturday, and the Daily Trojan’s last issue comes out Thursday.
Given this is the last football practice this paper will cover until August, it seems appropriate to glaze over, like a fine Krispy Kreme doughnut, the things we have learned over the last four weeks.
First, we have learned the early enrollees are deserving of the hype. Chicago-area wide receiver Kyle Prater is taller than the Sears Tower (it will always be the Sears Tower regardless of its current name) and secretly has a jar of peanut butter he stashes in his shorts because his hands are stickier than Charlotte’s web.
His roommate, freshman running back Dillon Baxter, has shown he can be a big-time contributor in the fall. On a Saturday a few weeks ago, with a darting and dashing run, he changed from an inconsistent freshman still trying to find his way to the next Reggie Bush. Granted, that 52-yard touchdown run was against mostly backups and walk-ons, but it still shows the speed and agility Baxter brings to the program. Something tells me we won’t be missing Joe McKnight.
Second, we have learned Lane Kiffin is no Pete Carroll protégé. Even though he worked under Carroll for five years in the early part of last decade, he has his own ways of going about things. Practices are no longer open to everyone. Discipline and accountability have replaced the loose Southern California cool as adjectives that describes the program. It wouldn’t surprise me to see Ms. Trunchbull replace Will Ferrell as the frequent guest of honor at practices.
Along those lines, special teams will be better at USC than it ever has been before. Under Carroll, special teams seemed to be more of an afterthought. But at the beginning of almost every practice, everyone on the team goes through various special teams drills. I mean everyone. A few weeks ago, the offensive and defensive linemen were catching punts. Who knows, maybe Kris O’Dowd’s speed is the best kept secret at USC, and he’ll be back returning punts.
We also learned we really don’t know anything about the secondary. The area with the most questions coming into spring practice has the most going out. With three players ­— redshirt junior Marshall Jones, junior Drew McAllister and redshirt sophomore cornerback Brian Baucham ­— likely to contend for a starting spot sidelined for most of spring practice, many former backups and walk-ons have been getting a lot of reps.
Dual sport athlete Jawanza Starling has gotten heaps of praise from secondary coach Willie Mack Garza, as have junior Daniel Harper and Shareece Wright, the only senior in the secondary. The group has managed to pick off multiple passes from Matt Barkley and Mitch Mustain over the four scrimmages USC has had, but we’ll have to wait and see until the fall how the injuries and lack of experience shape USC’s defensive backfield.
We’ve learned Devon Kennard might be the next big thing at linebacker for the Trojans. Chris Galippo, Malcolm Smith and Michael Morgan (who are all returning) got the marjority of the reps at linebacker last year. But Kennard, who is a converted defensive end, has emerged as one of the best players to come out of this spring. Kennard had eight tackles and a sack in Saturday’s scrimmage, and Kiffin said he “looks like an NFL player now.”
Lastly, we’ve learned the success the team has had this year will be determined by the play of the veterans. Barkley, senior tailback Allen Bradford, senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson, Wright, Galippo, O’Dowd and senior fullback Stanley Havili anchor the team that is very difficult to rank in the Pac-10 and in the nation.
Some days, it looks like this team could contend for a national title. Other days, it looks like it might visit the Emerald Bowl again. But it will be the play and the leadership of this core group of experienced players that will be indicative of this season.
There are many other things learned from spring practice but there’s not enough space here to list them all. We will know a lot more after the spring game on Saturday and once the season starts rolling in the fall semester.
One thing we do know is, with a new coach, a top recruiting class and a more mobile Barkley, this will be one of the most interesting and intriguing seasons USC football has seen in a while.

Verbose convoluted old news,and  really nothing we all didnt already know.
 Thank God Thursday is your last day!
Try writting about something newsworthy for a change?
  Jordan Campbell for instance how about breaking a story on why and how he seems to be on the bubble of being thrown off the team?  He has been on a zero tolerance track and may have violated it recently fro what I hear. 
 How about being a true reporter and not worrying about potically kissing everyone’s ass around USC so you can continue to write your mundane fluff stories in the hopes of someday gettting some  BS job wriiting sports up in Fresno! Grow some balls young Dude make a name for yourself! 
Who is the loser in the new coaching transition How Gallipo often times got lazy last year and mailed it in because he was hurt with his bad back.  
How Blake Ayles isnt living up to his potential coming out of high school.
  Why does Brice Butler lack the confidence to take his game to the next level? 
 Has Kiffen banished Ausberry and Boyd into oblivion by switching their positions and will the same thing happen to the often hurt Gallipo this summer when the gerrymander him to the outside linebacker position because of Kennards most recent success? 
Will Kan and Manoogian ever see the grass during a game with Barkley, Scroggins, and Wittek there?  Who will wind up odd man out destined to be the next Mustain after Barkley goes pro Scoggins or Wittek. 
,  Willl Abe Markowitz one of the best offensive Centers to play at USC in a long long time (big non stop motor great attitude amazing size fantastic linage smart & adriot) will ever get a fair shot at starting for the Trojans.  He had a full ride to Michigan State and would have been their starting Center  by now.
Someone needs to write about how good he has looked all spring.  Maybe he just needs to grow his hair long and get some tribal tatoos on his arm before they take him seriously.  Anyone watching knowes his game is there and then some 
s Seantreal Henderson going to be a Prima Donna from day one expecting special treatment becuase everyone has been kissing his overated butt fr so long in the hopes of landing this often times inconsistent oversized tackle.  From the film I watched he takes many plays off and relys on his size to dominate in high school.  that wont happen in the Big 10.  The first time he gets yelled at or benched is he going to walk around practice like a wounded worrior with his ego all bent out of shape looking for the next bus out to go hme and play for the Golden Gophers?  
Is Dillion Baxter the Golden child and is Tyler going to be overlooked? 
 Is Moody going to be overlooked?
Is Markeith Ambles and Robert Woods at a dissadvantage by not enrolling early. 
 Our kicking game was one of the worst in the Pac 10 last year.  It is great we have landed the pinacle of special teams coaches but we are still destine to utilize the two pedestrian punter and Kicker from last year by letting Matt Darr get away.
 This is what i mean about going after the real stories out there instead of rehasing what everyone has heard over and over. 
 Just being informed doesnt nessecarily make you a good reporter.  Being able to take the real issues going on the team will.  Don’t be afraid  to be the straw in the drink you might suprise yourself and get a sports job in a top 50 market when graduating by doing so!  Not to mention actually writting somethng we all just might want to read for a change!
how about a story on what’s the deal with Real Fan u Poser….Chill out dude! Way too much time on your hands

Richard Charlesworth didn’t plan this.
He didn’t even plan on being a swimmer. But his aunt had a pool in her backyard, a rarity in Charlesworth’s native England, so he — along with his brother and sister — was “thrown” in the water at an early age. Inevitably, he went on to become one of the best young swimmers in the country.
Long haul · Sophomore Richard Charlesworth specializes in distance swimming for the Trojans, swimming the 800- and 1,650-yard freestyle events in meets. Charlesworth never expected to be a distance swimmer, but embraces his abilities. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
But this? Swimming dozens of miles every week and as many as 1,650 yards in a single race?
“I don’t think I chose to be a distance swimmer. I think distance kind of chose me,” Charlesworth said. “I was never the guy who could get up and go fast for one length and then I would be done. I would always want to do another length and come back just as fast and then another length after that.”
To the casual observer, swimming lap after lap at high speed might seem like the opposite of a good time. Even Charlesworth admits distance swimmers are a peculiar breed.
“There’s something not quite right in our heads,,” he said. “But I do like the feeling at the end of a race. You feel like you’ve really accomplished something.”
Charlesworth’s competitive nature helped him become the 2008 British national champion in the 1,500-meter freestyle. That same year he represented Great Britain in the event at the Olympics, racing against the likes of Grant Hackett and Ous Mellouli.
While Charlesworth didn’t qualify for the final, finishing seventh in preliminaries, his performance in Beijing left one observer particularly impressed.
“After I finished my race, this guy approached me and said, ‘How would you like to go to college in Los Angeles?’” Charlesworth recalled.
It was Dave Salo, head coach of the USC swimming team. Charlesworth’s swimming stroke had caught his attention, and upon meeting him, Salo was pleasantly surprised by his “demeanor and maturity.”
“We kind of talked things over for a little bit,” Charlesworth said. But what Salo was proposing was, quite literally, foreign to a 19-year-old who had never even been to the United States before.
Charlesworth wasn’t sold — yet.
Less than 48 hours later, he watched as Mellouli out-touched Hackett at the wall to capture a gold medal and become the first man to defeat the Australian in the 1,500-meter freestyle in 11 years. Mellouli, a former swimmer at USC, still trains under Salo as a member of the Trojan Swim Club.
“That had some pretty heavy influence over me, the fact that I get to train with him now,” Charlesworth said of Mellouli’s connecting with Salo.
At the time, Charlesworth was also considering swimming for the University of Manchester. But the more he thought about it, the more appealing USC sounded.
“I’d just come from Australia and had the option between sunny California and not-quite-so-sunny Manchester,” he said. “The combination of [being] able to do the degree I wanted to do, train with the best people in the world, a lot better weather as well … It’s kind of a win-win situation for me.”
And so he made the long trek to Los Angeles at the beginning of 2009. In a daze, he stepped off the plane and onto American soil for the first time. Here he was, a stranger in a foreign land, thousands of miles away from anything he had ever known.
“In a sense I just jumped without looking,” Charlesworth said.
Indeed, it was something he hadn’t exactly planned for.
“It’s a kind of sense of adventure as well, just something different,” he added. “Just not to kind to settle with what everyone else is doing — try and do something different.”
His first practice at USC. Charlesworth remembers jumping into the pool and feeling “a little bit lost” as everyone started swimming a warm-up set he had never done before.
“It was a lot more intense than I was expecting,” he said.
But as the season progressed, Charlesworth began to adjust to the new regimen. His Olympic and international experience — he also competed for Great Britain at the 2009 world championships — started to pay off.
Salo noticed his new protégé was learning to swim fast at every practice.
“It took him a while to appreciate that, but he has done well,” Salo said.
It didn’t hurt, either, that his new teammates welcomed him as one of their own. Even before coming to USC, Charlesworth had exchanged Facebook messages with several of his future teammates. They have stayed friends since his arrival.
“Being from another country and not having family or a close support group around you, I think that really, really helped,” he said.
In this increasingly familiar environment, Charlesworth began to put up the results expected from a highly touted recruit. As the team’s preeminent distance swimmer, he took third in the 1,650-yard freestyle at the Pac-10 championships in March. Just a few weeks later at the NCAA championships, he placed ninth in the country, posting USC’s sixth-fastest time ever in the event.
Even faster times could be coming next season with a full year in Southern California under his belt.
But first, Charlesworth has turned his attention to an offseason of studying and swimming. In addition to taking summer school at USC for his civil engineering major, he will be training daily in preparation for the Commonwealth Games in India this October and, beyond that, the 2010-2011 collegiate season.
“There’s no letting up,” Charlesworth said, smiling.
This time, he’s got plans.

“I needed to keep myself sane because I was cut off from the world. No one knew where I was.”
These words — spoken softly by the petite half-Japanese, half-Iranian Roxana Saberi ­— barely described the terror she felt during 100 days in Evin Prison, one of the most notorious prisons in Iran.
Exile · Roxana Saberi was arrested by the Iranian government on espionage charges. Her book, Between Two Worlds, was released last month. - James Watson | Daily Trojan 
Saberi spoke yesterday in a discussion co-hosted by the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism and the USC Center on Public Diplomacy. The journalist discussed her 2009 arrest in Iran while she was on-assignment doing freelance work.
Now working to increase awareness of the injustices facing prisoners of conscience in Iran, Saberi recently released a book called Between Two Worlds: My Life and Captivity in Iran and co-wrote the screenplay for the recently released No One Knows About Persian Cats, the musical-political film that was the subject of Tuesday’s “Sound Check” column.
Saberi, a former Miss North Dakota, was an experienced journalist when she was held hostage in Iran’s Evin Prison, infamous for its collection of political prisoners. She received undergraduate degrees in communication and French as well as graduate degrees in broadcast journalism from Northwestern University and in international relations from Cambridge University. After working for a number of prestigious news organizations, she moved to Iran in 2003 to work as a foreign correspondent for the United States-based Feature Story News, an independent broadcast news agency.
In 2006, Saberi’s press pass was revoked because of a regime change in Iran, but she continued to report for news outlets in the United States while working on a personal project that would eventually land her in jail — a book about marginalized communities in the broader Iranian society.
With the change of leadership in Iran, many female journalists told Saberi that they weren’t sure what was going to happen to their jobs and  freedom under the next president. For Saberi, who had previously taken her freedom of speech for granted, this loss would be particularly painful.
“Why did you interview so many people for your book? Who paid you to write your book?” Saberi recalled being asked after her January 2009 arrest. “You have to confess that the book you’re working on is espionage for the U.S.”
As she was the one accustomed to asking all the questions, Saberi said the accusations from men in the interrogation room of Evin Prison  gripped her with terror. She was trapped in solitary confinement in a room about six by nine feet without a working toilet or sink.
Although she could not see for herself because she was covered by both a blindfold and a traditional Iranian head-garment, Saberi later learned that the interrogation room was lined with foam so that prisoners who were thrown against the wall would be spared from irreversible skull damage.
Saberi was housed in Section 209 of Evin Prison, a special wing controlled by an intelligence agency separate from the rest of the prison that housed many journalists, bloggers, civil rights activists, women’s rights activists and other political prisoners.
Even in such unnerving surroundings, Saberi retained the basic ideals of freedom and the rights that had been ingrained in her.
“Just give me a polygraph test and you’ll see that I’m innocent!” Saberi told the interrogators on more than one occasion while incarcerated.
She was not, however, allowed to receive a polygraph test, an attorney or the benefit of being considered innocent until proven guilty in Section 209 of Evin Prison. Eventually Saberi relented to pressures from her captors.
“I gave in,” Saberi said. “I said, ‘All right, my book is a cover for espionage for the United States.’”
After an hour-long closed-door trial, Saberi was convicted of spying for the United States in April and was sentenced to eight years in prison.
Immediately following her trial, Saberi went on a hunger strike that lasted two weeks, ending when she fainted from malnutrition.
With her arrest and imprisonment making headlines throughout the Western world, advocacy groups such as Amnesty International and the Society of Professional Journalists pressured the Iranian government for her release.
Less than a month after her trial, an appeals court reduced her sentence, and as abruptly as it began, Saberi’s ordeal was over — she was free to leave the country.
It’s been nearly a year since her 100-day captivity in Iran’s notorious Evin Prison ended and Saberi has turned her experience into an opportunity to help others. While she is glad to be back safely in the United States, she worries about those who wre not as fortunate to be granted release.
“Their only crime was to exercise basic human rights. Why am I free and they are still in prison?” Saberi said.
wow, she’s really pretty. no wonder she was a top finalists in Miss America. Good thing she’s all safe.
While I am certainly happy that she is fine and was able to return to the U.S., it is important that journalist do not over extend their welcome in countries that have no regard for human rights.  She remained in the country even though her press pass was revoked.  These countries do not like Americans or anyone else who takes part in telling the world about what goes on in their country.  If a journalist decides to take on that kind of project they should know what they are risking.  She was lucky, I’m sure there are many who are not as fortunate.
I’d be happy if I was held captive with her for just 1 day.

We all love to rant about $8 Caesar salads or the “Italian food” at Everybody’s Kitchen, but between questionable prices and soggy pasta, USC has a few well-kept secrets, both on campus or within walking distance. The wise senior has probably discovered all of these, but has long since forgone a meal plan and might have a car. For doe-eyed freshmen without reliable transport, however, take heed: You can find some more-than-decent eats on campus if you bother to look.
Best grub for a cold day: A cup of chili from Café 84. Whichever nameless chef makes this pot of hearty goodness deserves a hat’s off — this is one of the best grabs on campus. It tastes especially good when mixed with a little cottage cheese.
Best sandwich: Popovich Café’s panini. Don’t hike all the way over to Quiznos. Melty goodness is right on campus, and USC’s version comes with the option of iced coffee on the side.
Best dessert: The vanilla ice cream cone from McDonald’s. Sorry, 21 Choices. Your vanilla is decent, but decent frozen yogurt and $1 mix-ins can’t beat McDonald’s creamy, under-a-buck, 150-calorie, soft-serve wonder.
Best nearby Asian food: Trio House, on Figueroa Street by the Vagabond Inn. Stop in for some great pad thai, barbecue pork or chicken satay before the neighborhood finds out about this awesome new restaurant.
Best close-by Indian food: Manas Indian Cuisine on South Vermont Avenue. Hardly a secret, but for all the freshmen who think their Indian craving dies at Parkside, Manas presents a viable alternative. A few greats are the Chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan and the Tadka Dal.
Best use for Superior Grocers: Exotic spices and ethnic ingredients. Sure, Ralphs might have Crystal Light and regularly stocked skim milk, but Superior has lavender flowers, corn husks and a zillion chilies and spices.
Best grocery store for a budget: Smart & Final. It’s no Costco — is anything? — but Smart & Final can send you home with a semester’s worth of dry goods and a little extra money for Starbucks.
Best mock home-cooked meal: Wolfgang Puck’s rotisserie chicken with mac-and-cheese. If homesickness strikes, call your mom and pick up one of these to-go. You’ll be ready to face your mountain of laundry soon enough.
Best late-night food stop: Panda Express. When you don’t want to consume your weight in gross Denny’s Grand Slams or a Chano’s burrito, pop over to Panda. You’ll find something hot, decent-tasting and surprisingly healthy options.
Best store for interesting ingredients: Village Nutrition in the University Village. Where else can you find nutritional yeast, nori sheets, quinoa, protein powder and every tea known to man all under one roof? It’s a bit overpriced, but anyone up for a culinary adventure should check it out.
Best deal on produce: The CSA drop-off at Birnkrant. A box of fresh veggies that can feed four people for $15? Apparently some things on campus are reasonably priced.
Best secret menu option: Submarina’s foot-long subs. Sometimes, all you need to do is ask. These are perfect when you need to bury yourself at the library for eight hours.
Best post-workout fuel-up: Muscle Milk Light with cereal. After you’ve killed yourself doing deadlifts, hobble over to Café 84 for a well-earned pick-me-up. A Muscle Milk Light paired with any of the available cereals (especially Lucky Charms) will give you the protein and fast-releasing carbs you need to start rebuilding your muscles.
Best vegetarian options: Good Karma Café, Wednesdays and Thursdays at the United University Church. This is an all-you-can-eat veggie bonanza with a great patio atmosphere and some fine eats.
Best pizza: Slice Truck, usually on Jefferson Boulevard. These hardworking pizza-makers put Wolfgang Puck and Parkside Restaurant to shame, and they are tons of fun to talk to as well.
Best cold refreshment: Anything from the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. Jamba Juice is not necessarily the beacon of health it claims to be, and Starbucks gets dull fast. The Coffee Bean serves up everything from frappés speckled in chocolate-covered espresso beans to silky-smooth fruit shakes.
Best on-campus breakfast: Parkside Restaurant weekend brunch. If you need to plant your rear in a chair and hit that neuroscience book, go to Parkside for a leisurely brunch that can carry you through a good chunk of the day. Start with an omelet and a cheesy bagel and end on a fresh salad and soup. Remember, free refills and unlimited coffee!
Best food truck: Lee’s Philly, usually on Jefferson. You get a huge honkin’ Philly cheesesteak for a reasonable price, and it’s loaded with juicy, spicy-sweet meat and kimchi. Not something you would find at EVK.
Best place to study and munch: Literatea. Shaky Internet notwithstanding, Literatea has a slew of snacks from seaweed chips to yogurt parfaits. And lots of caffeine.
Best when-you’re-broke lunch: The entire campus. If you are really broke, just find an event going on around Annenberg or McCarthy Quad or glare at a few fliers. Chances are you will find some decent grub.
Best celebratory splurge: A Ground Zero Café milkshake. For joyous times or when you need more motivation to hit the gym, sink your tongue into the most sinful, awesome dessert around. The Yul Brenner or the Midnight Show? Let your decadent heart decide.

Paper Man is a movie about emptiness. Though it’s not really a good film, it’s not really a bad one either, and that might be the point.
Excellent · In Paper Man, Jeff Daniels (left) stars as Richard, a struggling writer with an imaginary friend played by Ryan Reynolds. - Photo courtesy of MPI Media Group 
Jeff Daniels plays Richard, the film’s main character who has a few problems. He is trying to write a novel after the complete failure of his last one, is seemingly incapable of interacting with other people and has an imaginary friend.
Richard calls his invented companion Captain Excellent (Ryan Reynolds). Reynolds does a nice job of embodying the cheesy superhero while simultaneously revealing his character to be more complex than the hero’s colorful costume and head of blindingly blonde hair would suggest.
This subtle complexity is absent in Daniels’ interpretation of Richard, who is present in almost every scene. Richard simply exists on the screen and is seemingly inactive. He stares at the blank page wedged into his typewriter but can’t find words.
Richard knows he can communicate nothing through an empty page, but Daniels seems to forget an actor conveys just as little through a blank performance.
At this point in Richard’s life, he is defined by his interactions with two women, his wife and a young girl he meets after moving into town. The girl, Abby (Emma Stone), seems real on screen, most likely because her character has the advantage of a more complex backstory than Daniels’.
Abby has a friend, Christopher, played with purposeful eeriness by Kieran Culkin, Christopher sulks around the edges of the frame and in the margins of the story, constantly admiring Abby in a way she cannot understand. Like Richard, Abby seems incapable of figuring out who she is.
The one character that is supposed to have a grip on her identity is Richard’s wife, Claire (Lisa Kudrow). She walks purposefully throughout the film, barely taking a moment to examine the absurdity of her marriage. In one scene, for instance, she plays a game of Operation with her husband. Claire, an accomplished surgeon, takes great pleasure in her success in the real world and the game. By failing to recognize Richard’s agony — even as he’s visibly tormented by the outcome of the board game — she simply compounds his distress.
Kudrow reveals her personal discomfort with her overly oblivious character, however, in one key scene in the film. When Claire discovers Richard sleeping with Abby — albeit innocently — after he threw a party for a bunch of high school students, she becomes furious. Claire demands to have a fight with Richard because that is what a real married couple would do in such a situation. (Abby is allowed to tiptoe out of this part of the movie.) The scene becomes painful as Kudrow’s hands waver — purposefully — at her side.
Kudrow is only playing a caricature  of a career-obsessed wife and, at that moment, her performance loses all sense of authenticity. Daniels’ emptiness of emotion does little to help the floundering scene.
Their argument lacks intensity because it is obviously fabricated. The screen doesn’t contain representations of real people, only two actors struggling to figure out what to do with their hands, something Daniels’ character owns up to, point blank. These actors are carefully folded edges of an origami swan, but the scene — and the movie as a whole — looks more like a tired bear.
Nonetheless, if you go into the movie wanting it to be good, you’ll find yourself seeking out authenticity in the artifice. Strangely, the only moment when real human beings seem to be on the screen is during the very artificial and constructed marital dispute.
In that scene, Claire is with another married couple when she walks in on Richard and Abby. Played by Arabella Field and Chris Parnell, the couple appears genuinely uncomfortable during the argument. Even though the scene comes across as fake to the viewer, the couple’s reaction to it is real — they just want to get out of the room.
The other two don’t recognize the film’s artifice, so their reactions are genuine and they portray characters actually witnessing a marital dispute. But when viewers see something else, they might want to leave the room just as much.
You want to like this movie. But like the people in it, it’s empty — it’s made of paper. Only at the end does Richard touch the keys of his typewriter, making something tangible appear on the page.
But by then, it’s not enough.
what’s a tired bear look like, exactly?

At the beginning of this semester, I entered a Monday class early to find several students sporadically placed around the 50-seat room. The class was “diversely” composed of white Americans, Asian-Americans and international students from China, South Korea and India.
Betsy Avila | Daily Trojan
When I entered the room the following Wednesday, the class had completely self-segregated, with each nationality sitting together.
The class remained that way for the entire semester.
Though USC boasts the largest international student enrollment in the country with 6,600 students, real diversity relies on students, not administrators. We should embrace the diversity of our campus by intentionally overcoming social barriers.
In my four years here, I have observed this phenomenon in many classrooms and social situations. As far as I could tell, racism played no role in the self-segregation.
Rather, the self-segregation arose from a lack of conversational ease. To relate to international students, Americans must intentionally pursue conversation, asking questions, gaining understanding of culture and finding relatable qualities.
This direct approach often feels uncomfortable and forced — somewhat like a networking event. Perhaps because of our laziness, or our limited conversational abilities, we immediately gravitate toward the easy, familiar faces.
Stanford Professor Anthony Lising Antonio conducted a study at UCLA that suggests self-segregation is not a problem on the Westwood campus. He backed up his argument with student surveys that showed the plurality of “friend groups” had no racial majority.
Newsweek offered a divergent opinion from Antonio, referencing studies that concluded that students self-segregate by third grade in order to develop individual identity and pursue popularity.
Some students would counter Antonio’s conclusion by pointing out the existence of cultural student organizations and racially driven Greek communities.
But these organizations are not necessarily bad. Race and nationality play an important part of identity in America. Few people want to be the minority in a group, whether religious, racial, political, gender or other wise.
Consequently, people congregate around people with identifying characteristics and similar backgrounds, largely because it is easier to relate.
Many religious groups advocate for their idea of the truth. Blacks brace to fight oppression. LGBT groups bond over the belief in individual rights.
Amid all of this, our culture claims to celebrate diversity on the grounds that a multicultural society will give more opportunity to everyone.
USC’s administration strives to promote diversity in the student body to provide us with the greatest possible learning environment. It is our responsibility, however, to actively learn from peers of different cultures, nationalities or religions.
I treasure the things my Indian co-workers have taught me about Bollywood and cricket. I treasure the experiences I had traveling through China with a native Chinese student I met in class.
If groups in the majority intentionally work to create a welcoming environment, allowing minority groups to not feel awkward, we will open our campus culture to greater dissemination of ideas, points of view, cultural experiences and new relationships.
Embracing diversity is important to our personal development, our future in an increasingly globalized world and our general ability to relate to people different than ourselves.
It begins with our awareness of differences. It begins in the classroom by intentionally sitting with people different from ourselves, learning from them and befriending them.
A piece of advice from a graduating senior: Don’t let USC’s wealth of cultural differences go to waste.
Jensen Carlsen is a senior majoring in economics and mathematics. His column “The Bridge” ran Wednesdays.
It is so lame when people try to symbolically make the appearance that  we can mix races in a group. What is that proving? Sanctimonious liberals love to point this out like this is such a tragedy a white guy will not sit next to a black guy, Asian guy, Mexican, etc. WHO CARES??
I would be just happen if we are no longer shooting each other in this city because someone is a different color and someone thought they were being diss’d. 
Jensen, What color are all your friends – not just the ones you like to be seen with – I mean your actual REAL friends? Right I thought so – thank you for answering your own question why people gravitate  towards  people they think  they are more in common with.
Wow. A really nice article in DT. My experience has been the same as the authors’. I am an International student, I used to wonder why people never mixed on campus. I thought “Birds of the same feather, flock together”. This is a problem with LA. You never see USC students mixing with locals. They are always the others.
In my experience, students do mix when the assignments get tough. All you have to do is say Hi and you can make some friends. I still remember my Korean, Japanese and American friends from my first class at SC.
Things are usually better at on campus jobs.
No doubt, Ucla has no self segregation. There are just too many Asians there. Even in the sororities. Not as cute as USC though. Classes are full and ppl usually have no problem talking to each other.
awestruck, I came to SC to learn, not just make money. Now I am Trojan and can’t wait for the football season to start! Not all students are like what you say.
Hey Jensen, I honestly believe that USC culls international students for the sake of upping its prestige. The Ivies used to do this; but they no longer need to do it because the names “Harvard, Yale, Princeton” alone sell themselves. 
Anyways, yeah, a lot of these international students merely see USC as a stepping stone. They don’t see their experience here as a journey, but rather an expedient to get that degree so to make money. And in their countries, degrees from U.S. universities usually hold more weight, and will get you further career-wise.  It’s that flat, plain and simple. Sorry, I didn’t mean to disenchant you.
Hmm… you ADVOCATE for self-segregation and “identity politics” in the form of a black students’ association, gay students’ association, racially-segregated Greek houses, etc… and you wonder why your peers seem to be separating themselves? You can’t have it both ways. Racism (etc) will only go away when all of you banish it from your own worldview.
USC is a microcosim of the real world and the bottom line the lack of trust will inherently group one another with their constituents.  This has been going on for hundreds of years if not longer.  You are young and lack the worlds day to day expereice to unfortunately grasp this!  Give it time you too shall see the world in a more succinct fashion.
I applaud the writer’s suggestions and viewpoint. However, given Vice President of Student Affairs, Michael Jackson’s ham-handed message to Muslim students earlier this year; I find it difficult to believe that students who come from Islamic countries would be inclined to reach out to other non-Muslim students at University Park. Perhaps, as the saying goes, “The fish stinks from the head down.”

As students, we have worried about the ABCs since before we could walk. We played with alphabet blocks and watched them swirl in our milk amid pastel Lucky Charms. And after learning to recite, read and write them, those letters have been circled in red on the top of every paper and exam supposedly quantifying  our level of intelligence ever since.

As USC students, it’s safe to assume most of us knew a report card filled with that pivotal first letter of the alphabet would be our best shot at joining the Trojan Family. Now that we are here, however, it seems many of us are still bogged down by that same goal.
“Take Writing 140 with this teacher — she grades easy.” “Don’t take Arts and Letters with that professor ­— he never gives out A’s.”
When registration rolls around, it seems students go on the hunt for classes that will guarantee them the best grade rather than enrolling in courses that interest them or enhance their chosen discipline.
This is apparent on the USC Undergraduate Student Government course guide website where students can submit and read reviews about professors and their courses.
Though the site states that “USG strives to hold each University member to the highest standards,” I’m not sure there is any benefit beyond students trying to determine how difficult a class and professor are going to be.
The areas of study offered in each category of the General Education program at this school are incredibly diverse and present a great opportunity for undeclared students to explore a variety of disciplines.
A freshman who is interested in politics, for example, could take the Law, Politics and Public Policy class (POSC 130) in order to fulfill a GE requirement, while simultaneously determining whether or not he might enjoy majoring in political science or international relations.
However, if the student goes to the course guide, and reads reviews that indicate the teacher is incredibly difficult and the course load is more than average, he will probably be discouraged from registering for the class.
A great opportunity is being missed here. While such classes should provide a chance for unsure students to dip their toes in the water before diving into a major or minor, the difference between course policies, workload and potential for success seems to discourage students before they get a chance to see if a particular academic discipline is right for them.
For those students at the bottom of the registration food chain, worrying about grade discrepancies only compounds the already stressful process of looking for any remotely interesting open sections.
Many students are indignant about the fact that relationships between teacher and student seem much  more strained  in college than in high school.
Emily Tong, a junior majoring in business administration, expressed her frustration by explaining, “When a professor tells us that only a certain number of A’s are going to be given out based on a quota, you literally start the semester off feeling like you have been set up to fail. It reminds me of high school when teacher’s did a bell curve.”
Even more upsetting to students is that the grading system is not universal. “It is really annoying when different rules apply to different classes,” said Tori Perez, a senior majoring in communication. “When certain majors make it so difficult to succeed people just chose a different concentration, and that is sad because we worked so hard to come here. We should be encouraged to follow our dreams, not scared from the start that we will fail.”
I don’t necessarily think implementing a universal grading system or universal rules for each course is the answer because each course is bound to be taught and evaluated differently.
But when students are discouraged from taking a certain class or pursuing a specific major because they fear they won’t get the grade they deserve, we have a big problem.
At this point in our academic careers, the ABCs should not be the first thing on our minds. The university should do its best to encourage teachers to evoke a love of learning in their students rather than a fear of final letter grades.
It would be a shame for USC students to start college, the beginning of their futures, on the wrong foot.
Sara Escalante is a senior majoring in political science.

That’s interesting, but doesn’t account for discrepancies between semesters.  Last semester 20% of my class earned A’s, this semester it is only around 10%.  The class size is the same but these students were just not as studious as last semester’s.  Last semester’s 19/100 student would have earned an A, learning the majority of the material and this semester’s 19/100 student would have earned a B, actually learning much less (in my eyes) than an A student.  Yet by the ranking system they would be ranked the same.   This is the same reason why I don’t curve.
What students need to realize is that when they check “credit” instead of “audit” on the registration form they are agreeing to have their work judged – their actual work, not just their “effort”.  Paying for and attending class is something one can do when auditing a class and not receiving a grade.
I think a big concern for many students is that they are afraid of learning they are actually just average.  Students act like a C is the end of the world when, in actuality, they are being told they are doing just as well as most of the other students.
@NaW:
That’s a novel suggestion. If it could be combined with statistics from entry and/or exit standardized tests for samples of students representative of those comprising the classes, you would have a very informative grading system.
Student reviews of teachers are not worth much, except perhaps to slackers and other mediocrities.  But I agree, grading sucks.  Grades have become inflated (largely as a result of student course evaluations) so that, like the children in Lake Wobegon, everyone is above average.  Instead of grades, let’s implement a means of evaluating students by ranking them in each class.  Absolute ranking–no shared ranks.  “Grades,” then, would read something like 103/104, 2/23, 35/35.

USC basketball knows better than most programs the impact the departure of a head coach can have on player turnover.
Just last season, the resignation of then-head coach Tim Floyd in the wake of allegations regarding his funneling of $1,000 in cash to O.J. Mayo resulted in the departures of DeMar DeRozan, Taj Gibson and Daniel Hackett to the professional ranks. Highly rated recruits Lamont Jones, and Derrick Williams, were also each granted releases from their scholarships and allowed to instead enroll at the University of Arizona to play for the Wildcats’ first-year coach Sean Miller.
Now, instead of losing players to the NBA and rival programs, the Trojans are benefiting from turmoil elsewhere. After Iowa fired head coach Todd Lickiter earlier this month, the Hawkeyes’ top big man, power forward Aaron Fuller, has decided to transfer to USC according to various reports first appearing in the Quad City Times.
Fuller, who led the Big Ten in offensive rebounding a year ago with 3.4 a game, will be a key addition for the 2011-2012 season when he will be eligible to suit up for USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s program.
A native of Mesa, Arizona, the 6-foot-6, 230 lb. forward’s return to the west coast will likely be well received by current Trojan forward Nikola Vucevic. With the expected graduation of Alex Stepheson next spring, Vucevic, affectionately referred to as Kid Euro by the message board geeks, will need another big body to compliment him in the low post.
And by the sounds of his past experiences in the Big Ten, Fuller should be able to do just that.
While averaging 12.3 points and 7.6 rebounds during conference play, he developed an affinity for posting double-doubles (six total), while becoming a force to be reckoned with in the paint.
During a crucial late-season home contest against Michigan, Fuller, who also reached double figures in the scoring department a career high 15 times, showed off his abilities by finishing with 30 points and 13 rebounds.

A recent study found that grade inflation occurs more at private colleges and universities than at their public counterparts, but officials say grade inflation is not a problem at USC.
According to the study by the Teachers College Record, private colleges give out higher grade point averages to students who have the same qualifications as their peers in public colleges. 
The study, which looked at average GPAs at 80 colleges and universities from 1930 to 2006, found that GPAs at private and public colleges rose at similar rates in the first half of the 20th century. After the 1950s, however, students at private colleges started getting significantly higher grades.  
According to the study, the average GPA at private colleges is 3.3, compared to 3.0 at public colleges. USC’s average GPA is 3.18 — below the national average for private universities.
Like other universities, USC’s average GPA has also increased, rising 3 percent in the past decade. But J. Lawford Anderson, director of the Center for Excellence in Teaching and a professor of earth sciences, said he does not think this reflects a trend of grade inflation.
“I don’t think our grades are rising at USC any more than the national average,” he said. “Grades here are monitored, so grade inflation is not a problem.”
USC officials say grade inflation has not become a problem because of strict rules and regulations.  
For example, a number of schools allow students to drop classes late in the semester, so students who might receive bad grades instead receive no grade at all, raising the school’s average GPA. USC, meanwhile, only lets students drop classes without a mark of withdraw on their records during the first three weeks of the semester.
“Students are getting better, but also we have very strict rules about when students can drop a class,” said Steven Lamy, vice dean for academic programs and professor of international relations, “In the College [of Letters, Arts & Sciences], we don’t really see any grade problems.”
The office of Academic Records and Registrar looks at trends between grades given to a student in a particular class and the student’s overall GPA to ensure that classes are not grading too easy or too hard.
Anderson said the reason for the rise in the average GPA might be the quality of the students. 
“Our incoming students are coming in with better credentials, and I expect that they should perform better,” he said.
Anderson added that he has seen a significant improvement in his students’ performance since he began teaching at USC in 1975. He said he gives more A’s to students now than in previous years.
“My students at USC have gotten so much better that I’ve stopped curving grades,” he said. “They are that good.”
Though the Office of Academic Records and Registrar monitors grades in all disciplines, each school has a different method of assigning grades.
Paula Narvaez, a freshman majoring in architecture, said that although she appreciates that some grades are curved on tests in some of her major classes, she feels curving grades can leave students with less incentive to perform well.
“It’s kind of like going into class not really giving your whole effort and still getting the grade,” she said. “Honestly, it’s what you expect going to college. You have to expect to work hard.”
Narvaez added that she believes classes with a quota system for the number of students who can get different grades offer a greater challenge to her.
“I know for some people getting straight A’s in high school, they expect to get A’s in college. For architecture, it’s kind of a reality check,” she said. “If you don’t understand the concepts, you’re not going to make the grade.”
Noel Kim, a junior majoring in biological sciences, said she believes quotas are necessary for ensuring a level of credibility in the grades professors give out.
“I think professors give a strict numbers of A’s to somehow show quantitatively that these students are the brightest and were at the upper tier of the strict bell-shape curve that most science professors follow,” she said.

When Deborah, Rachel and Sarah Herman graduate in May, it will be a historic moment not just for the Hermans but also for the university.
Triple take · (from left) Sarah, Rachel and Deborah Herman, all seniors, will be the first triplets to graduate from USC in the same year when they walk at May’s commencement. - Photo courtesy of the Herman family 
Deborah, Rachel and Sarah, all seniors, will be the first triplets to walk across the stage and accept their diplomas at the same time.
These 22-year-olds are fraternal triplets separated only by two minutes. All three say  they are often confused for one another. But at first glance, there are some apparent differences. Deborah is two inches taller than her sisters. Rachel has hazel eyes and her two sisters’ are brown. Sarah has naturally curly hair, Rachel and Deborah’s is straight.
It’s obvious that they share an indescribable bond. They finish one another’s sentences, have similar mannerisms and laugh at inside jokes.
Rachel, a public relations major, will accept her diploma with her sister Deborah, a communication major. Sarah will walk with them even though she is not accepting a diploma from the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism; each of the sisters was granted special permission to walk in the other triplets’ ceremonies.
After the first ceremony, the group will rush over to the Galen Center, where Rachel and Deborah will walk with Sarah as she accepts her business administration degree from the Marshall School of Business.
“Its important to share moments like that with people you care about,” Deborah said. “We shared every achievement together.”
During their time at USC, the sisters said they always had someone to rely on. Each of the Herman sisters was just a phone call or a walk across campus away from the others.
“It’s nice to know that someone will always have your back,” Rachel said.
Because they were at the same school, Rachel said they shared many college experiences with one another.
“We were going through this all together,” Rachel said. “We went to football games together, studied abroad together and share a lot of the same friends.”
But as much as graduation will be a celebration of the Herman sisters’ shared accomplishments, each one has taken her own road to get there.
Their decisions to attend USC  were not made together; each triplet chose to attend USC for a different reason and at a different time. They lived apart their freshman year and eventually ended up in unique majors.
All three sisters were active in campus groups and community service at USC. Among other activities, Sarah was part of the Shanghai Marshall Global Leadership Program, Rachel was athletic chair for Helenes and Deborah conducted research with professors in Annenberg.
“Part of my identity comes from being an individual but also being with my sisters,” Sarah said.
Come graduation, the Herman sisters will continue their family’s Trojan lineage. Their father earned his master’s degree here and their mother, Jeanne Herman, works at USC.
They credit their parents for fostering an environment where they could explore their own interests and passions.
“Our parents never made us dress alike or act alike or do the same things, but they told us to be our own self,” Rachel said.
Jeanne said commencement will be an important day for her family.
“This is a milestone for our family,” she said. “It’s three rites of passages.”
All three sisters are in the progressive degree program in Annenberg and will earn their master’s degrees in the spring of 2011. After that, Sarah said she hopes to go into sports management, Deborah wants to pursue a career in writing and Rachel wants to work in the entertainment industry.
“It’s cool being the first triplets to graduate, but for us it’s an everyday thing,” Deborah said.
Yay for a set of amazing triplets and congratulations!
Maybe mom got the job after they were accepted to help out! What an awesome story. What a great day graduation will be for the Herman family. Congratulations to all three of their beautiful daughters!
It also helps that Mom is employed by USC so that tuition remission for 3 daughters attending at the same time can come in handy….
hmm you sound bitter. Of course it helps; what is your point? My father also works at usc, and i’m grateful that tuition is significantly lower. I am constantly impressed by those who support themselves and are able to attend USC, and my hat goes off to you if you did that. No need to be critical though. Do you mention that because you think that the article should have stated it?
wow- way to take away from a great article. if you actually read closely, you’ll see that each girl got here on their own merits and they all made their own decisions of when to attend SC.
