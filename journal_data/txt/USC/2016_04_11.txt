I’m only 5-foot-3. My pack is about half of my height and feels like it weighs about as much as I do. I’m not sure how that’s possible when I’m carrying mostly granola bars. Also, why are packs measured in liters? I imagine the amount of water that could theoretically be splashing around in my 52-liter backpack and the thought of that much weight makes me a little faint. The fact that I haven’t tipped over already is a miracle.
These are the realities of backpacking. People have romantic ideas about backpacking across Europe, gallivanting across southeast Asia and spending a hot summer traveling around Australia. One look at those bulging backpacks and the first word that comes to mind is adventure.
I’ve spent the past two weekends doing both kinds of backpacking: the kind where you spend several days hiking carrying everything you could ever need in your pack and the kind where you explore a new city, check into a hostel and pride yourself on finding free things to do. I’ve also met plenty of backpackers along the way and they will tell you that this unique way of traveling is no walk in the park.
Hiking with everything you need to survive for a couple of days was one of the hardest things I have ever done. My back and shoulders ached for days. My legs strained at the thought of going uphill. Then I found out going downhill is similarly painful when you’re trying to fight the momentum from your heavy pack to tumble down the hill. I ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for four meals in a row because I didn’t want to add a camping stove and pot to my load.
Backpacking through cities isn’t always glamorous either. I’d overhear kids making phone call after phone call trying to find some seasonal work. They eat pasta every night to save money on food. Some hitchhike and some take buses to their next destination, and neither are really that reliable. One German girl I met was going home in a week and she said she couldn’t wait to open the cupboard and see it full of food and have the relief of knowing she didn’t have to worry about where she would sleep that night. She always carried a tent with her, in case the hostels in town were full.
She said that part about the tent with a huge smile on her face. Despite all of the hardships of backpacking, she was so proud of herself for consistently finding a way to survive, no matter what town she was in or what obstacles were thrown her way. She was adaptable and resourceful in a way that none of her friends sitting around at home would be. It gave her this confidence that she could thrive anywhere and she could do anything.
I wish more Americans did the whole backpacking thing. It’s a huge rite of passage for many Germans, Canadians and British kids. They spend several months or a year traveling to new places, and often, they come back ready to face adulthood or university with a better understanding of themselves and what they’re capable of. Meanwhile, Americans are in this rat race to get into the best colleges and then start their careers and somehow make the Forbes 30 under 30 list. We’re taught to keep moving through these milestones, but after my long weekend of backpacking, I came away with a new appreciation for having a place to set my pack down.

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism held a conversation with Judge Judith Sheindlin, the presiding judge on the Emmy Award-winning show Judge Judy, Monday afternoon. Willow Bay, the director of the Annenberg School, interviewed Sheindlin about her life and her time on the show, which is in its 20th season. Annenberg students also had the opportunity to ask her their own questions.
Before the conversation with Sheindlin, an overview video of Sheindlin’s career as Judge Judy played to a crowd of alumni, students, faculty and staff. It ended with a quote that has defined her career: “It’s your life, live it well.”
Throughout her interview, Sheindlin said she believed the country wants to work on eliminating gray areas in morality. According to Sheindlin, that is why the show still appeals to people, 20 years later.
“I think that there’s still a thirst in this country to get back to a place where right is right and wrong is wrong, and there are no fuzzy edges and there isn’t a lot of wiggle room for bad behavior,” Sheindlin said.
Sheindlin also relayed the importance of taking on responsibilities. She gave an example of a 15-year-old mother, who may be able to have kids but not be a good mother.
“You can’t be a great parent when you are 15 years old,” Sheindlin said. “Now you can have a baby when you are 15 years old — fish have babies, dogs have babies, cats have babies, lions have babies — but that doesn’t necessarily mean they are good parents.”
In her show, Sheindlin is known for settling family disputes and handing out harsh judgements when needed. Bay asked her if there was a line between her candor and cruelty, and Sheindlin responded with a “no,” primarily because of the way the entertainment industry has evolved.
“I think we’ve passed the point where we think that milquetoast-y kind of stuff entertains,” Sheindlin said. “It doesn’t.”
Bay asked Sheindlin about what skills had traveled with her throughout her professional career. Sheindlin believes that the most important skill that she had was the ability to get the right people to listen to her ideas.
“You have to have the leverage for wanting a better job, to be able to get the right people to listen to a good idea,” Sheindlin said. “Because there are lots of people who have really good ideas, but the truth of the matter is that unless you have the leverage, it’s clawing up a stream.”
She said that for people who are beginning their careers, it is important to focus on developing essential skills in order to become an essential member of the workplace.
“You have to make yourself indispensable,” Sheindlin said. “You don’t have to have a wildly successful television program to make yourself indispensable and you don’t even have to have a particularly unique skill.”
After giving advice to graduating students on how to negotiate on one’s own behalf, students had the chance to ask Sheindlin their own questions. One student asked why Sheindlin places so much importance on responsibility. Sheindlin responded in the context of her own experience in the family court system.
“In those cases [in the family court] I see the result of lack of responsibility,” Sheindlin said. “And lack of responsibility usually meant in all of those cases that children — innocents — suffered.”
Bay wrapped up her interview with a brief discussion on politics. Sheindlin commented on how people are becoming more politically involved.
“I think it’s been exciting from a communications perspective to see that more people have watched the debates than this time around than probably ever before,” Sheindlin said.
Judge Judy is another pseudo moralist on the scene who acts as though she is entitled to judge people instead of their small-claims cases.  The strength of their case becomes negligible once a background check reveals anything!  Apparently, Judge Judy has confused herself with God.  In any event, she should cease being such a lying hypocrite!  If people actually knew the basis for many of her judgements, she would have been canceled long ago.
“pseudo-moralist”?? You must be joking. Judy actually believes it is EVIL that is the reason for what men do, and not the result of “bad breaks”, or a rough life. She does not give excuses for anyone. I think the only one who confuses themselves with God is yourself, you are projecting. Perhaps Judy reminds yourself of something or someone you dislike, as you read way way more into it than actually exists. She is NO hypocrite. If you read her history, she has saved the US taxpayer millions, and had innocent men’s records expunged because of a lying, fraudulent medical group that falsely accused them of sexual molestation based on false positives (so they could collect lucrative Medicare funding) Judy proved these positives could not be true, and so on- anyway it’s in her book, and she was not tooting her own horn, she was complaining about the system and how easy it is to scam by dishonest entities who just want those big taxpayer dollars. She got a woman her child back, that was stolen from her by a Jewish group who ran a huge conspiracy involving judges, prosecutors, social services- she did this ALL by herself, not accepting even filing help as she feared anyone else might be involved in this conspiracy. She never mentions this, but it’s in an LA Times article from the 90’s (I have it saved to my hard drive). She has done SO much- so much, with no accolades, no public acknowledgment.

A 23-year-old man stole three laptop computers at USC Monday at noon and was arrested by Department of Public Safety officers after attempting to flee down Trousdale Parkway while being pursued by DPS and three bystanders.
The suspect stole two laptop computers from Leavey Library and another from the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. DPS was notified at noon about the latter theft, obtaining a description of the suspect and his location. However, when a DPS officer approached the suspect, who was sitting on the steps of the Student Union, the suspect fled on foot.
Although the officer tackled him on Trousdale Parkway near Moreton Fig, the suspect got back up and continued to run toward Exposition Boulevard. A staff member and two students pursued the suspect. A third student tackled the suspect north of Exposition Boulevard, allowing the staff member to detain him.
DPS arrived on the scene minutes later, along with the Los Angeles Police Department Southwest Division and Los Angeles Fire Department Station 15. Ambulances were also present and gave medical assistance to the suspect, who complained of asthma and trouble breathing, and the DPS officer, who sustained minor injuries. Both were transported to local hospitals for treatment. The three laptops were recovered at the scene.
The suspect, who is from Long Beach and has no USC affiliation, was taken into custody by DPS.

The Undergraduate Student Government finalized the executive positions for the 2016-2017 academic year on Thursday. The Daily Trojan spoke to the five executives of USG, who were appointed by the new Student Body President Edwin Saucedo and Vice President Austin Dunn.
Jenny Di, a junior double-majoring policy, planning and development and economics, will serve as USG’s Chief of Staff. Krystal Chavez is the incoming Executive Director of Program Board. Chavez is majoring in policy, planning, and development. She will work alongside the Program Board Finance Director, Hahney Yo, to oversee the 10 assemblies and five committees that make up Program Board. Yo is majoring in business administration and philosophy, politics, and law. Christian Edwards, a junior studying business administration with an emphasis in finance, will serve as USG Treasurer.  Luke Southwell-Chan, a sophomore majoring in communication, will become the senior director of communications.
Daily Trojan: What was your previous position in USG?
Hahney Yo: Last Spring and Fall semester, I served as the Assistant Director of Business Relations under marketing for Program Board.
Krystal Chavez: Previously, I was the executive director of the Latina/o Student Assembly and although it was my first year in USG I was a part of LSA since I was a freshman here at USC.
DT: What challenges did you face in that position?
KC: Some of the most significant challenges I faced were balancing the workload of being a director that programs events for our community and the USC student body while also being an advocate for the Latina/o students on campus through the Campus Climate Resolution. It was hard to recognize that there were so many issues that administration failed to address before that momentum started.
Luke Southwell-Chan: It was becoming acquainted with PB in general because I hadn’t had experience in that branch of USG, and it didn’t take super long to understand, but as with any new thing I think you have to figure what the organization is like and how it works.
HY: The biggest challenge I faced was taking on the position without any real guidance. It was a new position and I worked with a lot of different people in USG to shape that position. My position entailed working with companies looking to sponsor PB events, plan events and such.
Jenny Di: I was executive director of PSA. The biggest challenge was making sure that you were broadening the intellectual realm of students. I think the big thing with politics is that it can get very partisan, very divisive. So the hardest thing for us was making events approachable for all students, regardless of their political beliefs.
DT: What did you do in your previous position that you believe impacted our campus the most?
KC: Being a part of the Campus Climate Resolution when it was getting started really opened my eyes to making sure everyone knows that their voice matters and that there are people willing to fight to make this campus a better place.
HY: My position really enabled me to help bring in money for our committees/assemblies so seeing the money we received from companies be used to host awesome events is always nice! Plus, the free food it brings to students is always a plus!
LS: We were really pushing all the events that PB does to the student body, and making them informed with PB in general. That was the main aspect of my job and the most rewarding, especially when you see an event you’ve been pushing so hard do well, and have many students turn out.
Christian Edwards: This past fall semester we had a unique opportunity with the SoCal Vocals, to be able to fund their trip for professional development to Washington, D.C. to perform at the White House. So that was a particularly interesting occasion.
DT: Have been in touch with your predecessor?
CE: I’ve looked to [Previous Treasurer Tiffany Chang] as a guideline on how to succeed in the position and more importantly succeed for the student body. She’s given me many tips in terms of the transitional process.
KC: I actually met [Previous Program Board Executor Director Diana Jimenez] my first day at USC at freshman orientation and then after as LSA interns our freshman year together. So it’s an honor to be able to learn from her and be taking on this new role.
DT: Did they give you any advice?
KC: Diana’s advice was to recognize the kind of leader you are when you enter the role may not be the same type of leader you will leave as. She’s also told me this role although tough is so fulfilling, you learn a lot about who you are as person. You gain this perspective about thinking critically of everything you would not have gained otherwise.
DT: What do you plan to do with your position in the upcoming year?
KC: I think that with every executive officer role there are expectations on what you are required to do in your job descriptions per bylaws, but then there is also the freedom to take that and make it better each time a new person comes into the position.
JD: I really want to focus on transparency. My role in a sense is the opposite of Luke’s, I focus on the internal and making sure people are working to their full potential, understanding everything that’s going on and working to the best capacity to serve the student body.
DT: Tell us about a specific plan or idea you have for the 2016-2017 year.
JD: I want to help all the students in USG to work on their personal leadership skills and potential because part of being in our organization is not just being a leader but learning how to be a better leader.
HY: I want to do a lot of things! But for now, I want to have better outlines listing funding resources and the do’s and don’ts for assemblies’ member organizations. Two, I want to ensure committees and assemblies are periodically aware of their budget and are optimizing their usage. Three, I want to enhance the relationship between PB and USC administration. And four, I want to support PB directors in their endeavors as best as I can, because they honestly do so much great work.
CE: I’ll be working with Luke to get the word out there as much as possible. We do want everyone on campus to know that this is their student programming fee at work, and they should most certainly be able to take advantage of it.

Holocaust survivor Zenon Neumark spoke about his struggles and experiences during World War II at Popovich Hall on Monday.
At the age of 17, Neumark escaped from a labor camp, where he was held until a day before the camp was dissolved. Alone and without any weapons, Neumark avoided capture. The other inmates were taken to a concentration camp.
“The day before the camp was being liquidated, the commander of the camp told me, ‘Young man, escape if you can; tomorrow will be too late,’” Neumark said.
He escaped the camp next morning and lived for a few days in town, after which he made his way to Warsaw, Poland. According to Neumark, he was betrayed by his friends in Warsaw but at the same time, he had some good experiences with people who assisted him. He mentioned how one family helped him when he sent a note to them and asked them if he could stay there.
“I knocked on the door in the evening, and a lady and her daughter said they were glad I came and that I shouldn’t let her husband know. Two days later, her husband told me that he knew I was there and he brought me a piece of bread and marmalade along with a glass of milk. They were decent people,” Neumark said.
While living in Poland, Neumark joined three organizations, one Jewish and two Polish. After that he was taken to a camp in Vienna, Austria. He was freed when Russia liberated Vienna in 1945.
“I never had any grudges against people who didn’t help. The only people I did feel angry towards were friends who didn’t help,” Neumark said. “There were people who risked their lives and also the lives of their families, and still helped. About a 100,000 Jews did survive the war and they all needed the help of at least one non-Jew for food, shelter or documents. So they did get help.”
The average rate of murder per day was 10,000 people, according to Neumark. He said that he believed the propaganda and cult of personality cultivated by the Nazi Party as the main reason they were able to initiate the Holocaust.
“Nazis were the biggest deceivers and liars that were ever created,” Neumark said. “They used it as their tool.”

The recently passed California legislation that will increase the statewide minimum wage from $10 to $15 an hour will have vastly different effects on students, the University, and the California economy.
Many students have expressed their support for the raise in the minimum wage, citing reasons as varied as increasing the extra spending money they enjoy from part-time jobs to expressing solidarity for low-income earners who struggle to pay the bills and provide for their families.
Other students, however, see the higher minimum wage as a damper on the economy, sacrificing long-term growth for short-term benefits.
Signed into law last Monday, the minimum wage bill underwent an expedited voting process through both houses of the state legislature to make it onto Gov. Jerry Brown’s desk within a week after being introduced. The remarkable speed at which the legislation went from first draft to enacted law can be attributed to a series of negotiations that took place behind the scenes, where officials worked out the bill’s many details and nuances.
Under the new law, the increase in the minimum wage will take place gradually over a period of time until 2022. On Jan. 1, 2017, it will be raised to $10.50, then to $11.00 in 2018, and then a $1.00 annual increase until it reaches $15. This incremental system gives businesses time to adapt and prepare for the increased expenses they will incur, rather than overwhelming them with a rapid push to $15.
Though Los Angeles County will certainly be affected by the statewide increase, this is not the first time the city has considered similar measures. In fact, last year, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors voted to increase the minimum wage incrementally to $15 by 2020. Thus, the city itself, as well as unincorporated areas within L.A. County, will experience similar wage hikes as the rest of the state but at a faster pace.
Matthew Kahn, a visiting professor of economics and spatial sciences at USC, said that companies may begin to hire more experienced or efficient workers as a result of the legislation to make up for larger costs.
“Economic theory predicts that a firm hires a worker if the extra revenue the worker generates per hour is greater than the extra cost she is paid,” Kahn said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “If workers are now paid $15 per hour, then firms will be less likely to hire ‘marginal’ workers. For example, if a worker is expected to generate $12 in revenue per hour — a firm would have hired her before the minimum wage of $15 was enacted but now will not do so.”
Kahn also said that the gradual increase will give businesses a better chance of adapting to the new policy.
Many students saw the need for a higher minimum wage in California and expressed their support for the recent reforms.
“I think it’s a good thing,” said David Rosenfield, a first-year law student. “It’s going to take a few years for [the minimum wage] to get up to $15 an hour, but with what the minimum wage is now, someone working one job can’t live here in Southern California … They have to work multiple jobs.”
Students are also in favor of the wage increase because of the increase income students will receive as part of the part-time employment, such as Natalie Galdanez, a sophomore majoring in theater who also works as a receptionist.
“[Raising the minimum wage] will definitely give me more living money,” Galdanez said. “Since the cost of living is so high in Los Angeles, the $15 minimum wage will be a big boost to workers who live here.”
Andy Navarro, a StaffPro security employee at USC, says that the wage hike will likely increase the leisure time workers like him experience, since workers won’t have to work for as long.
“Most people would benefit from [the increase],” Navarro said. “I see people working hard hours here, working overtime sometimes seven days a week and doing double shifts every other day. So for them, it would be a benefit, because they wouldn’t have to work as many hours.”
Opponents of the bill, however, fear that the bill will increase costs for businesses by too much, and that many will resort to laying off employees in favor of more efficiency and automation.
The prices of everyday goods may also rise in tandem with the incremental wage increases because of higher overhead costs, and as a result, low-income workers will not be able to enjoy the greater purchasing power they were promised.
“There’s going to be a lot fewer employees in the coming years,” said Pratik Patel, a freshman majoring in business administration.
Patel also said that businesses simply cannot keep up with the rising labor costs, and something will eventually have to give.
Max Gonzalez, a freshman majoring in business of cinematic arts, said that since USC employs many local residents as staff members, the local community will likely suffer as a result of potential job losses in the future.
“Most of the employees that work here are from the surrounding community, and [USC] is what they live off of,” Gonzalez said. “It’s going to hurt people more than it’s going to help.”
Though there is the possibility that USC will be forced to cut jobs as a result of the increase in the minimum wage, some students are hopeful that the University will be able to adapt well to the changes and prevent job losses.
“I think, for large employers, the effect will be a lot less than on small employers in the sense that they will just have to make changes to the pay structure from the bottom all the way to the top,” Rosenfield said. “But I think larger employers will be able to accommodate that more easily.”
Kahn also thought that larger employers, such as USC, will be in a better position to deal with the wage increases than a small business.
“USC is not a for-profit firm,” Kahn said. “Our job is to teach students, to create great research and to be a vibrant community neighbor. This ‘triple bottom line’ means that USC will be better able to adapt to the minimum wage than a small business. If USC must pay workers a higher wage and if these workers live close to USC, then the general community gains extra purchasing power from the higher minimum wage. I do not believe that USC would significantly reduce its workforce due to the higher minimum wage.”
The University is currently in the process of analyzing the effects of the minimum wage increase, according to Associate Senior Vice President of Auxiliary Services Daniel Stimmler.
Though the economy as a whole may not be subjected to large changes, Kahn said that certain groups of people and industries may bear the brunt of the legislation’s burden.
“The macroeconomy will barely be affected,” Kahn said. “Prices of some service sector goods will rise, some low-skill workers will receive a wage increase, while other low-skill workers will have more trouble finding work.”
Though he acknowledges potential problems with small businesses and other concerns with sectors of the workforce, Rosenfield is optimistic that the new legislation will prove to benefit California in the years to come.
“In the United States, the income gap is a pretty big issue. If you go to other countries, such as Australia or any of the Scandinavian countries, the individuals who work for minimum wage enjoy a higher standard of living than in the U.S.,” Rosenfield said. “I think it’s a good step in the right direction.”
As a non-Californian, I cannot believe CA legislators are so mean-spirited.  Why the hell would they stop at $15/hr?  If more is better, then the minimum wage should be at least $30/hr.  Maybe $50.  For the life of me, I cannot figure out why they stopped at $15.  help me out here.

Up until April 24, students will have an opportunity to step into the wild, thrilling world of diamond smuggling — for half an hour, at least. Escape SC is bringing the escape-room concept to campus with a “diamond heist” twist, challenging students to decipher a series of clues to prove their innocence after being framed by diamond smugglers.
“I think what really drew me to [escape rooms] was the idea of being in a completely different environment and having to piece together a bunch of things and get out quickly, and the chance to prove myself,” said Racquel Fygenson, one of the members of Escape SC.
Escape SC was formed by Landon Brand, Fygenson, Brianna Doyle and Justin Bishop, freshmen at the Iovine and Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation, for a class project. Their assignment was to earn as much money as possible in five weeks. Initially, they tried creating a portfolio website. However, they decided to pursue a project they were more passionate about.
While designing their Diamond Heist escape room, they drew on their previous experience with escape rooms and built a plotline using antique props for inspiration.
“One of the things that we did is that we went to an antique store and a couple thrift stores, and we just looked around at different props we thought might be useful, and then came up with a way to build a story around that,” Fygenson said. “We came across this kind of old-timey, 1920s scale at an antiques store and we thought, ‘Oh, this is pretty cool. We could build something about smuggling around this,’ and then from there we came up with smuggling diamonds.”
Knowing there were many escape rooms already out there, they tried to innovate on the conventional escape-room model and make it more accessible to USC students.
“First of all, we wanted to make a really low barrier of entry for college students, so we tried to figure out how to make it a shorter experience that we could make cheaper, and also bring it right to USC’s campus,” Brand said. “We also provided more backstory than most escape rooms do, just because we’ve been frustrated with how little plot goes into each escape room — it seems like it’s just a bunch of puzzles, and we wanted to provide something so that, maybe, at the end, you could tie it all together and feel like you know what the story is.”
The Diamond Heist escape room debuted on March 26. Escape SC is also raising the stakes by offering a $150 cash prize to the team who solves the puzzle in the shortest amount of time before the end of the event. So far, the time to beat is 12 minutes, 28 seconds.
For students looking to earn the grand prize, Brand and Fygenson offered tips on the optimal strategy to use, based on their observations of other groups over these past two weeks.
Fygenson recommended inspecting the room for clues immediately, instead of focusing too much on any one clue in the beginning.
“A lot of teams get caught up in the idea that there are puzzles, that they might not be able to solve them, and they psych themselves out. In reality, all the puzzles are pretty solvable as long as you have scoured the room and you have all the clues,” Fygenson said.
Brand shared his theory on the secret to doing well in the competition, based on the two main types of groups who play escape rooms.
“One group takes a pretty shallow approach to the puzzle and just moves quickly around the room, and typically, they do very well,” Brand said. “Another group just finds a clue, and then tries to go all the way through just figuring out the significance of that clue, right off the bat, maybe before it’s even possible for the room.”
The Diamond Heist escape room is available every Saturday and Sunday noon to 10 p.m. Reservations for a group of one to four people can be made on their Facebook page for $40 per group.

The New York Times didn’t call it better than Sundance, Cannes and SXSW combined, but that doesn’t mean Ground Zero’s first official film festival wasn’t.
This past Sunday, the Ground Zero Performance Café planned a screening of several 10-minute short films produced and directed by USC students.
“This is our first film festival, so we’re learning as we go,” said Jack Runburg, public relations and promotions manager at Ground Zero. “We asked some of our friends at [the School of Cinematic Arts] to publicize our event and were overwhelmed by the response.”
While the event is new, the Ground Zero staff hopes it will become a yearly endeavor. Runburg said the festival will be very similar to the open mic nights and comedy shows thrown by Ground Zero, but the staff encourages people to come with blankets and popcorn to watch the films.
Runburg said the films were chosen by film buffs on the Ground Zero staff.
“We had a panel of barista film aficionados screen the films and then choose based on both quality and how we felt they accurately reflected our goal to showcase our peers’ talent in all ways,” Runburg said. “We want to help everyone appreciate the work that our peers are doing and have a greater understanding of the issues and the art they are passionate about.”
Adrian Hernandez, a sophomore majoring film and television production major, was one of the directors chosen to showcase his work on Sunday. Other filmmakers include Susan Lin, Elaine Yee Wong, Caroline Frined, Sikander Sidhu and Jacqueline Walukas.
A filmmaker since age 10, Hernandez has enjoyed cultivating his skills at SCA.
“Back [when I was 10], my family only had access to our old VHS camera,” Hernandez said. “Therefore, the first films I ever created had to be edited linearly using VHS — universally considered the worst way to edit a film.”
In high school, Hernandez became the president and director of his school’s drama club and directed several plays, while also honing his photography skills. He was excited to share what he’s now learned at SCA with the USC community, with the screening of his short film Sidney.
“Sidney is the story of how an elderly Jewish cantor met his wife-to-be at a young Israeli dance when he was 19,” Hernandez said. “I produced this [film] in collaboration with the USC Davis School of Gerontology’s Zekenim program, which takes the stories of elderly Jewish citizens and produces works of art around them. I wanted to take a unique approach to this documentary by telling Sidney’s story largely through cinematic recreations.”
For that layer of documentary realism, Hernandez said he limited all speech in the film to Sidney’s voice exclusively — no one spoke unless he spoke for them.
“[So], on set, I had actors emote based on the speed and delivery of [Sidney’s] narration,” Hernandez said.
Hernandez hopes the story he shares is relatable and nostalgic.
“I’ve heard many of my Jewish friends say this story remind them of their grandparents,” Hernandez said. “I hope people can find a similar relatability in [Sidney’s] tale of the night of the festival.”
At the end of the night, Ground Zero handed out various awards to the filmmakers and there was a brief Q&A session with the filmmakers for those curious about Ground Zero’s history. The cafe has also hosted a band night and open mic night.
Other upcoming events at Ground Zero are Commedus Interruptus Improv on Tuesday, and Rhapsody in Blue on Friday.

A few days ago, I stumbled across an old vinyl recording of Vincenzo Bellini’s Norma at The Last Bookstore. The album, recorded at Teatro alla Scala in 1960, includes Maria Callas singing the title role, as well as tenor Franco Corelli and mezzo-soprano Christa Ludwig in their respective roles. It was a charming find, especially considering it was less than $5. So naturally, I bought it.
Norma is one of the most popular bel canto operas of all time. Likewise, it is also one of my favorite operas. Bellini was the master of the single-line melody — his haunting and decorative part-writing is what make his music such a treasure to the ears. Even famed Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi once remarked on the beauty of his melodic writing, saying that no other composer had this type of skill. However, what makes this opera one of my favorites is not necessarily the music but the themes of friendship and loyalty that are present throughout the plot.
To give a very concise synopsis of the opera, the piece chronicles the life of Norma, a high-priestess of the Gallic Druids. Though in a position of power and commanding respect, she broke her vows by falling in love with Pollione, a Roman general fighting in Gaul. She, in turn, bears his children in secret. All the while, Pollione has also maintained a secret relationship with Adalgisa, a fellow priestess in Gaul. Upon his return to Rome, Pollione begs Adalgisa to accompany him, to which she agrees. However, once Adalgisa learns of Pollione’s history with Norma, she angrily denounces him, as well as their relationship. In a classic case of “chicks before dicks,” Adalgisa remains her loyalty to Norma over her affair with Pollione.
I am particularly sensitive to issues regarding friendship right now. Over the past few months, I’ve realized that many of the people I’ve chosen to surround myself with don’t seem to value loyalty as much as I do and in turn don’t have my best interested in mind. The entire ordeal has been rather humbling, as it has affirmed my suspicions regarding other people’s intentions. Maybe I’m just being cynical, but my decision to not seek friendships further from the ones I already have stems directly from my fear of rejection.
All in all, these undertones are what make Norma so relatable in today’s society. In addition, I believe that Adalgisa is the true MVP of the opera. Her refusal to continue her relationship with Pollione after discovering his romantic involvement with Norma has stuck with me, as I value loyalty above all other traits in regards to friendship. And perhaps I find these themes so powerful because I’ve always had some difficulty maintaining friendships. Though I have a few very close friends who I’ve stayed in touch with since high school, for the most part, I haven’t held on to many of the friendships I’ve made in the last few years. I believe this is related to my trust issues, because I have little faith in people’s intentions when it comes to loyalty. Regardless, I’ve always known that friendship is one of the greatest gifts of all. Perhaps that is why I am so picky when it comes to who I choose to surround myself with.
I’ve listened to my vinyl of Norma almost nonstop since purchasing it. Bellini was not only the master of melody (or the “Swan of Catania” as he is more commonly referred as), but he was also so meticulous in the way particular emotions were translated into the melody. Verdi was correct in saying that no other composer had his talent in melodic writing. And in a society that seems to value self-gratification, I can always turn to Bellini to restore my peace of mind.

The baseball team prepares for a short trip up to Malibu on Tuesday night, as the Trojans face Pepperdine for the second time in as many weeks. USC won last Tuesday’s game against the Waves at Dedeaux Field in extra innings thanks to a walk-off single from senior Timmy Robinson. Robinson and company will now look to make it two in a row against Pepperdine at Eddy D. Field Stadium.
The Trojans are coming off a weekend series win over Utah, which improved their record in Pac-12 play to 5-4 and 15-15 overall. After taking two impressive victories to open the three-game set, USC suffered a 14-8 blowout at the hands of the Utes in the series finale. The team remains upbeat, however, having notched another Pac-12 series win.
“We obviously wanted a sweep [against Utah],” senior AJ Ramirez said. “But taking a series against one of the top teams in the conference gives us momentum going forward.”
Head coach Dan Hubbs agreed that the series win was paramount, but he also criticized his pitching staff for not making opponents work to get on base, particularly in Sunday’s finale.
“We have to minimize the free bases we give up — it’s as simple as that,” Hubbs said. “When we don’t pitch, anyone is going to beat us.”
Junior Bernardo Flores, who tossed six scoreless frames in relief on Saturday, agreed with his coach and praised senior pitcher Kyle Davis for firing up the rest of the Trojan arms to step up their game over the course of the season.
“He’s always out there pushing us and helping us strive to get better,” Flores said. “It’s one of those things you see in a leader, and it’s what has motivated us to go out there and perform.”
Hubbs, as he has often repeated throughout the spring, said that he wanted his players to trust their own abilities and stop pressing, both at the plate and on the mound.
“When we try and get big and try to do too much, that’s when we get into trouble,” Hubbs said.
Perhaps a familiar foe will calm USC’s nerves on Tuesday. After last week’s loss pushed them below .500, the Waves rebounded over the weekend to take two out of three against Santa Clara, and Pepperdine will enter its matchup against the Trojans with an identical 15-15 record. The Waves are definitely comfortable at home, with 12 of their 15 wins of the spring coming at Eddy D. Field Stadium and this USC squad needs no reminder, after being pushed to 12 innings last year and escaping Malibu with a 2-0 victory.
Despite the disappointing end to the weekend, Ramirez was confident that the squad would come out firing against Pepperdine.
“We can compete with anyone in the country,” Ramirez said. “We know we can hit as a team, and we know we can pitch as a team.”
First pitch at Eddy D. Field Stadium will be at 3 p.m. After taking on the Waves, the Trojans will prep for a grueling weekend series in Eugene, when USC plays Oregon in its third in-conference series of the season.

For the past several weeks, the men’s golf team has held the top spot in the national rankings, and the talented group will look to keep it that way. The No. 1 Trojans are competing against some of the best competition there is at the Western Intercollegiate, which began Monday at the Pasatiempo Golf Course in Santa Cruz, California.
Through one round of the tournament, the Trojans stand in third place with a score of 4-under. Pac-12 rivals Oregon and Stanford are currently first and second with scores of -9 and -5, respectively. Oregon’s Aaron Wise is the individual leader after one round with a round score of 63 strokes; USC’s junior Rico Hoey and freshman Justin Suh are tied for the team lead with round scores of 67, followed closely by senior Andrew Levitt with a round score of 68.
The Trojans began last month with two consecutive victories in the Southwestern Jones Invitational and the Southern Highlands Collegiate, led by outstanding performances by Levitt and sophomore Sean Crocker. Crocker, who finished second overall at the Southern Highlands Collegiate, earned Pac-12 Golfer of the Month honors after helping the Trojans push past two other top-20 teams in Las Vegas to win the tournament. Crocker also turned in a solid effort at the Goodwin — where the Trojans finished ninth overall — with a 2-over to finish tied for 17th in the tournament to close out the month.
Crocker will have to continue to perform well for the Trojans to have a shot at winning the Western Intercollegiate, as the field is among the toughest the team has seen this year. USC is one of six top-25 teams competing in Santa Cruz; their opponents include No. 7 Arizona State, No. 9 Stanford, No. 15 Cal, No. 21 San Diego State and No. 25 Washington. Unranked Oregon, UCLA and Arizona are the Trojans’ other Pac-12 foes in the field, along with Pepperdine, the University of Texas at El Paso, Hawaii and UC Irvine.
For any of the teams to win the tournament, they’ll have to tackle the challenging course at Pasatiempo, which was designed by Alister MacKenzie, the same architect who created the master-class links at Augusta National. USC has seen success at the Western Intercollegiate in the past, winning the tournament six times, but the Trojans haven’t finished first as a team since 1995. The last time a Trojan captured an individual victory was Sam Randolph’s win in 1986.
“Like Augusta, the greens are a big part of the challenge at Pasatiempo,” head coach Chris Zambri said. “In addition to the greens, there are many large trees that need to be avoided.”
Zambri, who is at the helm of the USC men’s team for his tenth season, has led the Trojans to a successful season thus far with a roster that features both veteran leadership and young talent. In addition to Levitt and Crocker, Zambri will also look to Hoey and sophomore Jonah Texeira to contribute in a big way to the team’s total score. On Feb. 10, Hoey was named to the Ben Hogan Award watch list for the second consecutive year; the Hogan Award is collegiate golf’s equivalent of the Heisman. Crocker’s name also appeared on the list this year for the first time.
“As the season approaches the end, it is very important that everyone is playing well,” Zambri said. “We are good enough that if everyone is playing like they can play, we can compete to win every tournament we play.”
The “everyone” Zambri refers to also includes Suh and Ryan Slater, each of whom has finished in the top 15 at least once this season. It’s easy to think of golf as an individual sport, but winning collegiate tournaments takes a collective effort, which the Trojans have been able to successfully put together several times this season. The team has finished in the top 10 at each of their nine tournaments this season, with their lowest finish coming in the Goodwin two weeks ago.
USC will finish the month of April with the Pac-12 Championships, but the Western Intercollegiate is essentially an identical preview of the postseason tournament. The Trojans will face off against nearly all of their conference opponents in Santa Cruz, enjoy a few weeks off preparing for the postseason, and then meet up with Arizona State, Stanford and Cal, among others, once again in Salt Lake City beginning April 29.
For now, the Trojans have their sights set on winning in Santa Cruz.

With the continuous shakeup of the leaderboard at the Masters, one player remained the constant.
As the plot continued to thicken, Jordan Spieth remained atop the field. The seemingly unflappable 22-year-old was cruising to his second green jacket in as many years.
Then, it happened. Spieth’s inexplicable implosion in the middle of Amen Corner on Sunday all but destroyed his chances of retaining his crown as king of Augusta National. In the span of just a few minutes, Spieth went from leader to chaser — from 5-under-par to 1-under. Surely, fans thought their eyes were deceiving them when the tournament leader found the water hazard twice on the same hole.
He was indeed unable to rebound from his stunning 7 — a quadruple bogey on the par-3 12th hole.
Danny Willett went on to win the Masters and Spieth had to trudge through the process of presenting the Englishman with the green jacket. Spieth showed genuine class during what was surely an agonizing experience.
Yet these moments are inevitable in arguably the cruelest sport on the face of the planet. Spieth took home the hardware from the U.S. Open last June, but Dustin Johnson three-putted the 18th green on a fateful Sunday and finished just a stroke worse than Spieth. Johnson collapsed on the 72nd hole at Chambers Bay. Spieth lost his magical touch on one hole on the back nine at Augusta. It happens to the very best.
Spieth will never forget the burn of the 2016 Masters, but the horror story that was the 12th hole could actually make him even better in the future. He has already snagged two majors. Golfing great Sergio Garcia has never won a major, and he turned pro when Spieth was in the early stages of grade school.
Spieth’s Sunday debacle was incomprehensible, but the nature of the sport suggests that something like this was bound to happen at some point in his career. In a sense, this experience could be a catalyst for Spieth to take his game to the next level. He is so young and already possesses such a refined skillset, but he failed to break 70 after shooting a sporty 66 on Thursday. A 66 at Augusta is unreal, yet the Spieth of the future will likely be able to card that score on all four days. He erred on one hole, but one hole can doom a player in this unforgiving game. Ernie Els six-putted the first hole on Thursday and was immediately out of contention.
Augusta National is ruthless, yet Spieth was nearly infallible in this tournament. His short game was reliable, as he correctly read the challenging greens time and time again. He just happened to err on one hole, and well, that was that.
Spieth has the potential to go down as one of the greatest of all time, and he is precocious both on and off the links. After a devastating turn of events in Augusta, Spieth faced the media and came back with earnest, candid responses.
The consistency this young man exhibits from hole to hole and round to round has the capability of blinding fans from the fact that he is mortal. To see this golfing demigod so somber was eerie. While he does not provide fans with the raw emotion of a Tiger Woods, his game in and of itself is something to behold. He was still the personification of equanimity after losing out on Sunday, but a certain fire ought to be brewing from within this competitor. This Sunday was certainly one to forget for Spieth, but he simply will not be able to shake the image of the 12th hole.
That is not necessarily a bad thing.
This Masters moment will likely fade into the background when Spieth is surrounded by major trophies one day, leaning back on his throne of greatness. Or perhaps this moment might be in the forefront of his mind as he reflects on an illustrious career, noting that Sunday was the day that sparked his transition from great to unstoppable
This was a career-defining moment for Spieth. In other words, the best is yet to come.

The Trojans added to their list of recruits for next season after three-star power forward Nick Rakocevic committed to USC on Monday, marking the Trojans’ fourth freshman recruit to sign a letter of intent.
The news follows the transfers of forwards junior Darion Clark, sophomore Malik Martin redshirt junior Katin Reinhardt. Junior guard Julian Jacobs is also reportedly entering the NBA draft.
Rakocevic, a 6-foot-10 forward from St. Joseph High School, received offers from multiple top-25 teams and has a composite three-star rating from ESPN, Scout and Rivals to go along with First Team All-State honors and a Division 3A Illinois State Championship in 2016.
At just 210 pounds, Rakocevic’s frame is undersized in comparison with other top forwards in the nation. Luckily though, his Tim Duncan-esque play in the paint makes him a scoring presence in and outside of the paint.
Prior to signing with the Trojans, Rakocevic received 16 offers from many top schools, including the NCAA Tournament runner-up North Carolina Tar Heels.
“Honestly, [USC] was just the best situation for me,” Rakocevic said to Scout.com. “I think that the people there and the coaching staff really love me, and I really love them. When I was on the official visit, I knew it was the place for me.”
In terms of Rakocevic’s potential playing time in 2017, he is on board with a backseat, complementary role as head coach Andy Enfield described to him during his visit last Thursday.
“His plan is to develop me my freshman year,” Rakocevic said. “It’s going to be a lot in the developmental process, but I’m going to be playing. My sophomore year, I’m going to be one of the guys to step up and be one of their main big guys … I’m just excited.”
On the roster the Trojans will have three core forwards in rising senior Nikola Jovanovic, and rising sophomores Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu who will share time with Rakocevic and fellow freshman recruit Harrison Henderson.
Rakocevic should earn some playing time considering that the departed Martin, Clark and Strahinja Gavrilovic’s combined 13.7 minutes per game earned in 2016 will be distributed among him and Harrison.
Forwards Boatwright and Metu came in and succeeded as freshmen last season, and Enfield will look to groom Henderson and Rakocevic the same way to be the prominent interior players that Boatwright and Metu were in USC’s 2016 campaign.
Rakocevic is unique in his supreme length that allowed him to dominate the glass in high school and play much like Metu above the rim.
Also, Rakocevic is slightly taller than Henderson and will most likely be utilized in bigger packages along with Jovanovic to pick up rebounds and prevent any further scoring. Rakocevic and Jovanovic have similar games on offense and could potentially be a pain to defend.
With an underrated shooting and defensive capabilities, Rakocevic is an intriguing prospect with a virtually unlimited potential if he can increase his size and strength. The summer and fall camps will prove if he is up for the challenge of big freshman minutes.

Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, an especially significant novel in feminist literature, depicts a moralistic dystopia in which women are relegated to total subservience to men, acting purely as wombs or wives, but never both. The protagonist and narrator, Offred, reflects on the differences before the advent of the theocratic dictatorship that tore her from her family and forcibly turned her into a concubine, stating, “Now we walk along the same street, in red pairs, and no man shouts obscenities at us, speaks to us, touches us. No one whistles. There is more than one kind of freedom … Freedom to and freedom from. In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to. Now you are being given freedom from.”
The mechanism of “freedom from” is leveraged to silence and suppress women in Atwood’s dystopia. However, this mechanism can be explicitly used to suppress any demographic. As more and more students demand freedom from intellectual diversity by labeling it as oppression and attempt to end it through the systemic silencing of opposing opinions, the American college campus is moving closer and closer to a regressive dystopia.
The idea of college safe spaces and coddling is a relatively hot topic right now. I myself have written about it multiple times from a contemporary perspective, focusing on constitutionality and precedent. But viewing the regression of free speech and intellectual diversity on campus from a historical lens paints a more viscerally jarring picture.
Consider the history of the rationalization of sexism. Pennsylvania State University psychologist Stephanie Shields hypothesizes that historical paternalism was enforced by a cultural standard labeling men’s instinctive responses as “passionate” (and thus strong,) but women’s instinctual responses as just “emotional.” By generalizing women as biologically predisposed to emotional or intellectual weakness, sexist behavior and norms have been justified as protecting women. On college campuses, safe spaces are a form of this protectionism that subjugates people and continues to treat them like children.
As I have previously asserted, free speech is the best attack on bigoted behavior simply because it does not discriminate. The best way to shut down racism is to employ one’s “freedom to” logically deconstruct racist and other bigoted fallacies, not just silencing the conversation. In fact, shutting down the conversation to ensure people’s “freedom from” discomfort or even immoral opinions just ferments bigotry into an even worse beast, churning ignorance and fallaciousness into resentment and anger. This backlash to silencing and political correctness is exactly what produced the rise of Donald Trump. Trump supporters, who are statistically working-class and uneducated, are not supporting him for the successes that were Trump University or Trump Steaks, but instead, they admire Trump’s self-described best asset: his “aura of personality.”
Aside from its syntactic redundancy, this “aura of personality” is just a manifestation of pent-up anger, not only at a feeling of a decline of American exceptionalism, but also largely as a violent reaction against the politically correct, safe space culture which vilifies any and all dissenters and forces them into silence and submission. The result of silencing someone, even a bigot, is not shutting down the idea, but fueling their fury. In essence, safe space culture breeds the very evil it seeks to destroy.
Furthermore, college students should not want an arbitrary line drawn to grant them “freedom from” uncomfortable ideas. Intellectual diversity, especially that of the highest quality afforded by attending a prestigious university, is an incredible privilege and an asset to learning. Only by learning how to defend moral or logical ideas can students, especially those in the liberal arts and humanities, truly become scholars. Yet today, conversations are shut down with claims of triggers and microaggressions. While claims of PTSD from traumatic events such as rape or abuse should not be taken lightly, psychologists have already come to the conclusion that discourse and mild exposure to events which caused trauma is the best way to overcome it.
The people who tend to advocate for safe spaces also tend to be the ones who vehemently oppose a potential Trumptatorship. However, to halt a rising tide of a cultural and political system motivated by fear and irrationality, we, as college students with the power to shape some part of the future, must not impose a fear of intellectual dissent in our own social spheres. It is tempting to give into the imposition of “freedom from” unpalatable ideas, but choosing “freedom from” over the “freedom to” uncensored or coded speech destroys the very core of what it means to receive an education and will condemn us to a future of a society ruled by terror and instinct instead of knowledge and advancement.
Tiana Lowe is a sophomore majoring in math and economics. “Point/Counterpoint” runs Tuesdays.
Very well written article. 
Well done, Tiana Lowe! You skillfully connected the  timid and sissyish expectations of some for “safe spaces” to protect them from frightening “triggers” and “microaggressions;” with the appeal that Donald Trump has for his followers. No, I am not among his followers, but I can observe that many find his bluntness and candor to their liking.
The political ideas that Mr. Trump blurts out or advocates may be vile and likely will eventually eliminate him. But whatever the contents of his speech, he is not “politically correct,” an atrocious concept. A lot of people who deplore Mr. Trump’s ideas, like his direct, outspoken style. So yes, he probably attracts many followers who are revolted by “political correctness” “triggers” and “microaggressions.” They will not win for him office, but theirs is an interesting reaction to “political correctness.”

From the divisive political rhetoric of the 2016 presidential election to recurring instances of racism taking place on college campuses across the nation, the case for safe spaces at universities has been a prominent, yet controversial, issue. Though many students have expressed the need for campus forums in which they feel welcome and comfortable regardless of gender, ethnic background or sexual orientation, some have denounced the need for such spaces as a threat to freedom of speech and a means of coddling overly sensitive students.
But it would seem that those who hold this type of view don’t understand what it is they’re opposing.
A safe space is, very simply, a place in which students can come together without being subjected to outdated — though nonetheless present — forms of bigotry such as racism, homophobia and sexism. They are inclusive spaces in which students aren’t forced to be exposed to the kind of language and microaggressions that encourage the types of inequality and prejudice that we as a society still struggle with today.
Within the last year alone, we’ve seen instances in which university administrators have resigned after mishandling instances of racism on campus. Last fall, our crosstown rivals at UCLA marched in protest after members of their student body wore blackface to a Kanye West-themed fraternity party. Even during this academic year, our own campus has had to deal with similar acts of bigotry — from the instance in which our former student body president was accosted with a racial slur, to the more recent incident in which a student was called a racial epithet and pelted with eggs within university housing.
It is precisely these instances of campus racism that reinforce why safe spaces are so fundamentally important. Such instances didn’t occur in a bubble, and they’ve sparked a nationwide conversation that has forced students and administrators alike to come together and decide what kind of campus environment we hope to foster. It was in light of these instances that our Undergraduate Student Government passed a diversity resolution reaffirming our campus-wide commitment to creating a more inclusive, respectful campus community. The resolution was met with near unanimous support.
Those who argue in opposition to measures like these tend to frame their argument around freedom of speech, reasoning that promoting such a campus environment can only happen at the expense of students’ right to express themselves freely. Such a defense, however, suggests an inherent misunderstanding about the purpose of safe spaces in the first place.
Safe spaces and freedom of speech aren’t mutually exclusive. Just as students are free to voice our own opinions and viewpoints on a number of issues, students are also free to address those with whom we may disagree. But such an exchange needn’t be predicated on the right for students to make other students feel continuously disrespected. There are ways to voice our own viewpoints and beliefs without relying on the kind of bigoted or prejudicial language that is opposed to the kind of university environment our students and administrators are trying to create.
Moreover, framing safe spaces as somehow threatening to students’ freedom of speech highlights the privilege that those who make such ludicrous arguments ultimately have. The argument that spaces for students to escape the microaggressions they receive on campus somehow detracts from other students’ ability to feel comfortable ignores serious issues of racism, sexism and the like that hamper many students from thriving on their own campus. Regardless of whether or not some students are privileged enough not to endure these forms of bigotry each and every day, there is no reason why they should subsequently deny safe spaces to other students who may not be so lucky.
Our tuition doesn’t have to keep rising for us to realize that we’ve given a lot to be here. As students who pay upwards of $50,000 a year in tuition, we’re not being oversensitive when we ask for the respect and resources necessary to create the kind of campus environment in which we can thrive as scholars. We’re simply demanding that we get what we paid for.
This isn’t to say, of course, that our campuses must be reduced to echo chambers — places in which people are surrounded only by ideas and thoughts that fit their own, with no regard for opposing opinions. Such an environment is antithetical to an academic setting and does little to promote serious debate and dialogue.
But the freedom to discuss should not come at the expense of students’ safety and well-being. And that’s simply all that students who demand these kind of spaces are asking for — an open and relaxed atmosphere in which students can engage openly without being made uncomfortable, unwelcome or unsafe on the basis of their ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or any other part of their identity. Such a request isn’t unreasonable — it’s one that our student and administrative leaders should continue to fight for.
Yasmeen Serhan is a senior majoring in international relations. “Point/Counterpoint” runs Tuesdays.
I agree with Yasmeen that the USC campus is no place for sexism, racism, insults, rudeness and other forms of bad behavior toward others. No one on our campus should be subject to such treatment and should be safe from it. Fellow students, faculty and staff should strongly counter such behavior. 
But what if the “triggers” and “microaggressions” are words innocently intended and terribly misconstrued? If you have been reading about these concepts, you may have read about some absurd and utterly false descriptions where no “triggers” and “microaggressions” can be inferred by normal people.
We should not have to accept evil affronts, but it is also bad to offend friendly people by misconstruing their statements in bizarre and extreme ways. Don’t forget, “microagressions” and “triggers” are defined as subtle insults. They also may exist only in the overrought imaginations of those cocked to perceive them, whether objectively real or not.
Translation: “objective reality” is what “normal people” (e.g. straight / white / male / Christian / etc. people) say it is. A woman, person of color, gay, trans, disabled, etc. person who asserts that your expression is harmful to them is just suffering from an overwrought imagination. Innocent intent professed on the part of aforementioned “friendly person” defeats any attempt to redress the harm caused. 
I don’t think so.
Point taken, Sodium11!  Objective reality should certainly not be defined by the narrow groups you mention. And yes, I do understand your sarcasm. As for casual sexism or racism or other disparaging and mean comments, they deserve no protection. Other students and faculty who note such vile behavior should challenge it and certainly not look away or coddle that behavior. 
But some people are cocked to perceive a slight, a microaggression or the like, when nothing was intended, nor detectable by others listening. In short, it works both ways. Mean behavior, even if casual or subtle, is mean behavior and should be countered. But making oneself into a fragile, sensitive victim by straining to perceive non-existent slights is likewise not behavior to encourage or applaud.

Throughout my time in college, I’ve witnessed an increase in the use of the word “feminism,” and with it, an increase in the number of people who identify as feminists. Though there are many different types and meanings, feminism as a whole is generally perceived to be a movement aimed to achieve equality between men and women. Many people, once they find out what feminism actually is, tend to support the concept.
I myself identify as a feminist, and would argue that the newfound mainstream usage of the term is a key step in achieving the movement’s goal. Given the general increase in the understanding of feminism, I’ve been pretty surprised — and disappointed — in how little feminism has impacted romance and relationships in college. Inequality is ever-present, and it negatively impacts both men and women.
As a man who is in a committed long-term relationship, I oftentimes find myself playing the role of wingman at parties, especially for my friend, Joe. By doing so, I’ve discovered there are a few reasons why having a wingman is beneficial. First and foremost, as a wingman I can hype Joe up in ways Joe himself couldn’t do without making himself seem arrogant. Furthermore, if both Joe and I are trying to find Joe a lady, the chances that Joe actually find a lady essentially doubles. However, this assumes that Joe is actually trying to court a lady. Oftentimes he doesn’t try, but instead waits for me to make an approach or confirm a lady’s interested in him before he gets directly involved. This leads us to the main reason why having a wingman is beneficial — the wingman assumes responsibility for the approach. Regardless of the setting or what the first move actually entails, society has ingrained in us the idea that men are supposed to court women. Thus, the burden of approach is on men.
The idea that men are supposed to court women negatively impacts both men and women. For men, the burden of approach and a disproportionate fear of rejection is oftentimes crippling, which is precisely why having a wingman or wingwoman is so essential. However, not all men that have trouble approaching women have access to a wingman/wingwoman, and often these men resort to alcohol, overt aggression and catcalling to compensate. For women, making the first move routinely gets them criticized and thought of as desperate at best, and slutty at worst.
In a truly feminist society, both men and women would approach one another with equal frequency, and the burden of approach would be equal. This would be beneficial for both parties. For men, the burden of making the first move has been removed, and they would enjoy being courted for a change. For women, catcalling would greatly subside, and women would be able to approach men without criticism.
Unfortunately, inequality and anti-feminism also exists outside of the party setting. Over the summer I was with a few of my guy friends, and somehow or another we began to talk about chivalry. The discussion started off with the concept that men should always open the door for women. Personally, I think that holding the door open for another — regardless of gender — is just basic common courtesy. Though holding the door open for another person is a nice gesture, it is by no means an obligation. Almost all of my friends disagreed with me. One of my friends, we’ll call him Jack, went on to further say that acts of chivalry toward women are obligations men must meet and that women have a right to traditional acts of chivalry. He felt particularly strongly that men must pay for women on dates. According to him, it’s only fair that men should pay for the date since men ask women out for dates in the first place. Jack even claimed that he’s heard women say if the man doesn’t pay for the first date, there will be no second date.
The concept that men must pay for dates is anti-feminist on several fronts. First and foremost, it’s simply unfair and unequal to have the man pay for the woman on a standard date. Second, the notion that men should pay for women stems back to the idea that men should court women, and having the man pay for the woman further perpetuates this negative idea. Third, and perhaps most importantly, this notion disrespects the woman’s economic capabilities, and implies that women need to have men provide for them.
Moreover, when you couple the notion that a man must pay for a woman and a man must make the first sexual move, a troubling reality arises. The reasoning goes as such — I’ll take her out on a few dates, pay for her dinners, then I’m entitled to have sex with her. This line of reasoning — which is unfortunately prevalent among some men I know — leads to the objectification of women. At worst, it promotes a rationale that amounts to the man feeling he has the right to have sex with the woman because he paid for her dinners. In other words, the women gave the man tacit consent when she allowed him to pay for her. This, of course, is absolutely ridiculous and is not consent, but it’s the line of thinking that these two social norms imply. In a truly feminist society, these norms wouldn’t exist. Men would benefit by no longer having to pay for women on dates. Women would benefit because they would be seen as economically capable as any man. They would also be respected, valued and courted for other reasons besides sexual gratification.
This is not to say that men should not approach women first, hold the door open, or pay for a date. Men — or women — should feel free to do any of these. However, traditional views on courtship and chivalry has led to certain expectations and obligations. When unequal treatment in obliged, feminism loses, and both men and women are negatively impacted.

I’m a freshman, and I’m still struggling to find my group of friends here. It’s difficult because on Facebook and Instagram I see all my friends from high school having so much fun at their own schools with their new friends, and I have nothing really to compete with. I’m afraid that this school wasn’t for me — but I don’t want to transfer.
Research has shown that spending time on Facebook can lead to depressive feelings because of social comparisons (Steers, Wickham, Acitelli, 2014). Considering your social life a “competition” probably makes this worse too. 
As a senior, I have met many more of my classmates than I knew as a freshman. You’d be astounded by the level of intelligence, quirk and general dopeness some of your peers have, and the crazy shenanigans they are involved in — coding apps, balancing music careers and writing novels, just to name a few.  There are organizations, both officially and otherwise, for everyone. Your people are here somewhere, you just have to find them. I wouldn’t write USC off just yet.
Expand your social horizons sophomore year and see how it goes. If you still feel like USC isn’t for you, transfer. Both the academic and social aspects of college are important and, let’s be real, this school is too expensive to not enjoy your experience.
