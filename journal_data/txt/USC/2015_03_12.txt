Isabella Sayyah | Daily Trojan
Sometimes I forget that London is one of the top tourist destinations in the world and not just any ordinary city. You see, though I live in central London, I don’t live next to Big Ben or the London Eye. When I walk out of my apartment in the morning, I see joggers out for their morning run and workers on their way to the office, not sightseers.
Living in a relatively residential area of London has made it a lot easier for me to feel like a true Londoner. During a normal day, I’m not dealing with gawking tourists walking slowly and actually waiting for the crosswalk light to turn, instead I’m going to class and working in coffee shops, grabbing dinner with friends and going to bars and pubs.
I hadn’t quite realized the transition I’d made from visitor to semi-resident until this weekend. My friend Mollie, who’s also studying abroad in London, had some friends who are studying in Paris visit for the weekend. I spent part of Saturday with them, going to some of London’s many markets, seeing Big Ben, taking photos in the signature red phone booths, walking along the Thames — some of the main things visitors do upon first arrival.
In addition to being a Saturday, it was also an absolutely gorgeous sunny day out — one I honestly haven’t seen the likes of since I left California — and it’s the start of spring break season. And that meant one thing: The tourists were out in full force. Often, I could barely move there were so many people crowded around me, and even when I could, the pace was not the brisk London speed walk I’ve gotten used to in my time here.
But though it was cool to be a guide, one of the people who knew where the tube station was and how long it would take to get from one area of the city to another, it was also kind of terrible. London was no longer my city to explore; suddenly it seemed I was surrounded by invaders. I actually missed the gray, drizzly days with people hustling to get inside rather than packing the banks of the Thames to enjoy the sunshine.
The only other time I’ve ever really felt like this, like a native surrounded by tourists is in my home for nearly all my life — Los Angeles. So though I’m very far from being a true Londoner, I guess this means I’m not just a visitor any longer.

Tucked away from the bustle of Downtown and the unrelenting vroom of cars, is a little oasis for pasta lovers called Maccheroni Republic. Going in with a craving for Italian and a brief recommendation from a friend, I initially knew little of the Broadway trattoria, but left the restaurant feeling full and fulfilled—as if I had just had a home cooked meal.
As a native New Yorker, good Italian food had always been within my reach, whether we were talking dollar pizza “Italian” or decadent, truffle-topped pasta Italian. Coming to L.A., I knew there was plenty of food within driving distance, but it’s taken much more time to reach, so when that mentioned friend uttered the words “really good pasta”, I was quickly sold into giving Maccheroni Republic a chance—on a Sunday night.
Upon arriving, I was surprised that the restaurant was not located amidst lit-up, fast-paced surroundings despite its address on Broadway. Instead, Maccheroni Republic is nestled cozily into a smaller alleyway that intersects the main street: it is Downtown, but at the same time, not. In the evenings, the outdoor area is strung with dangling lights under a darkened sky. Warmed by the work of heated lamps, guests enjoy an intimate dining experience that mimics the ambience of a candlelit dinner indoors, with the breeze and open air that can only be found outside.
For this degree of privacy and thus sense of exclusivity, I was initially feared that the pasta and cream saucy goodness I craved would be out of my budget range. After scanning the items on the menu, however, I saw that few dishes were priced above $15. I breathed a sigh of relief and proceeded to the toughest decision of the night: picking which pasta dish to try.
Maccheroni Republic is best characterized as a trattoria, so its offerings are fairly simple. The restaurant serves appetizers, salads, soups, and homemade pastas, all staples that are priced moderately, given their quality of ingredients and attention to craft. With indecisiveness taking over, I decided to ask a waitress what she recommended and she explained that the restaurants three most popular dishes are the Bianchi & Neri, a black and white thin vermicelli dish with shrimp, mushroom, and roasted pancetta in a creamy bisque; Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare, linguine with clams, bay scallops and shrimp in a tomato sauce; and Rigatoni Pom’Amore, a pasta in a creamy tomato sauce topped with burrata. Having been among the company of two other friends, we decided to share all three pastas along with an appetizer of fried calamari. Each pasta dish catered to varied preferences, but the general consensus was that each received high marks.
The black and white pasta was topped with a rich creamy sauce that was hearty but not overwhelming. Cooked with pancetta, the bacon-y flavor was present throughout all parts of the dish: from the vermicelli to the sauce. The linguine was definitely geared toward the seafood lover who would order it, but the pasta and sauce definitely did not lag behind; it made for a good base for the seafood and ensured that the shrimp and clams never felt too heavy. The rigatoni, lastly, made its appearance by being the most simple. It reminded me of the delight of a homemade pasta dish—just with a much more unique tomato sauce. It was a special blend of creamy and sweet that made an ordinary rigatoni dish just the more special. Though all three portions were on the smaller side, the bread that preceded the meal made for a dinner that was just filling enough.
Maccheroni Republic was created by Antonio Tommasi and Jean-Louis Mori, who are also known for Locanda Veneta, Ca’Brea and other regarded Italian eateries. According to an article published by the LA Times, the Maccheroni Republic empire is seeking to expand, with possible international locations on the way. Word on the street is that Hawaii might be the next to indulge in this pasta. Stay tuned!
Maccheroni Republic // 332 South Broadway // Lunch: 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mon.-Fri. // Dinner: 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. Mon.-Sat. // 4:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. Sun.

It’s March 8. Dozens of young, eager J.Cole fans file into the Santa Ana Observatory on this mild Sunday night. Inside, the modestly sized venue is packed, seemingly beyond capacity, allowing Cole to send a message before even setting foot on stage – he is a force to be reckoned with.
Cole is touring for his recently released album, 2014 Forest Hills Drive, which many critics hailed as his best project to date. With him he brought recent signees to his newly formed Dreamville label imprint, Omen, Cozz and Bas. It was clear that Cole’s Dreamville newbies were more than just opening acts – they were part of a cohesive presentation of the Dreamville sound and image.
Omen kicked the show off with material from his upcoming debut album. Billows of smoke frequently permeated the hazy blue stage as Omen bounced along with his beat. The crowd immediately showed its loyalty to Cole by giving a surprising amount of support to one of his protégés. Cozz and Bas were more aggressive performers than Omen, giving the opening group a good dynamic.
Bas concluded the opening act with a question: “Are you ready for J.Cole?” The crowd released cries of affirmation and began chanting Cole’s name. After about what seemed to be an eternity – but really turned out to be 20 minutes – the deep blue lights facing the stage flipped over and illuminated the anxious faces of the concert-goers. A tall figure emerged from the back corner of the stage to thunderous cheering; the chanting resumed.
Cole, wearing sweats and an unassuming white t-shirt with “Forest Hills Drive” written plainly on the back, smiled and thanked the crowd. He declared his appreciation for Santa Ana. “I’m coming to Staples Center in L.A. this summer,” he explained, “so tonight this is Santa Ana’s show.” The crowd showed their approval by throwing their W’s in the air. And with that, Cole went right into “Intro,” the jazzy opening of 2014 Forest Hills Drive.
Cole would perform his critically acclaimed album in its entirety, and on every song, the audience would rap right along with him. With 2014 FHD, J.Cole tries to establish himself as a top player in the rap game; the energy and sincerity with which he performs, and the pure love his audiences show him, makes his case convincing. Early in the show, Cole performed Wet Dreamz, his relatable coming-of-age tale, featuring some of Cole’s best production and story-telling. Cole rapped with fervency, but still managed to create an intimate atmosphere, as if he were simply having a passionate conversation with the crowd.
Like Cole himself, the lighting arrangement was modest throughout the whole show – Cole was the only point of focus. The lights took on a blood-orange hue halfway through the show when Cole started Fire Squad, the boldest song from FHD. Cole put on his crazy eyes and lunged onto a speaker as he called out Elvis, Macklemore, Eminem, and Iggy Azalea all in one line. The audience ate up every word with zeal and reciprocated the energy that Cole emitted.
Cole then took some time to tell his story. He talked about how he would do anything – including rapping on people’s voice machines – to get recognized. Accordingly, he diverged from the album to perform a few songs from earlier projects. The audience proved their devotion by rapping along with every word of “Light’s Please,” a track from Cole’s second mixtape released six years ago.
After two more tracks from past projects, Cole went back to FHD with “St. Tropez.” As he did for almost every track, Cole gave a bit of history for “St. Tropez,” which chronicles his first tastes of fame. By giving the audience his story, Cole made every performance seem earnest, which made his show easy to appreciate. And Cole clearly appreciates his fans just as much – he puts everything into his performances because he put everything into the music he’s performing.
The future looked bright for Cole as he rapped the album’s last song, “Note to Self.” Despite his success, he has a chip on his shoulder, and that has kept Cole one of the most energetic and honest performers of his generation.

Before you left for college, every adult in your life probably told you that these would be the best four years of your life. You arrived to USC bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to make the people who would end up being your sorority sisters or fraternity brothers for life, your new best friends, and your bridesmaids and best men. Once you fumbled your way through the first couple of weeks of meeting dozens of people every day, you (hopefully) emerged with a solid group or spread out scatter of friends. Everything, it seemed, had gone perfectly. But without a doubt you were soon faced with one of the most serious problems facing college students: Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). Mindy Kaling sums it up pretty accurately in the title of her book.
It basically means that any time you try to do something productive, like your reading assignments or catching up on sleep, you are haunted by the fact that somewhere on campus your friends and peers are doing something fun that you’re therefore missing out on.
The stages of being haunted by FOMO are fairly distinct:
1. You feel bad that you’ve been procrastinating a lot lately, so you decide to designate an afternoon or evening to unadulterated productivity. Naturally, you make a big show of telling all of your friends that you can’t hang out because you have to get some work done.

 
2. . You sit down and read a few pages, but then your group text with all of your best friends starts to blow up. You take a quick break to see what’s going on and see that they’re going out to dinner, going to the row, or seeing a movie. Basically, they’re doing something that’s better than whatever you’re doing. You will them to stop.

3.  You flip your phone over or put it out of reach so that it will stop distracting you, but you’re in too deep now. You can’t focus anymore because you’re thinking about the plans that are in motion. You force yourself to read a few more pages but let’s be honest, you can’t absorb any information at this point.

4. You stare at your book and try to convince yourself that staying home or in the library studying is the responsible choice. But what if your friends go out and have the best night of their lives? You will have missed it, and that’s simply not acceptable. You know the feeling…welcome to FOMO. You want your friends to have fun, but you want you to have fun, too.

You have two options here. (The second one is much more likely).
5. A) You decide to be studious and continue studying. Your friends will undoubtedly manage to go have a marvelous time without you. Get ready to endure Snapchat stories and Instagram posts and stories about the fun you missed. You can hardly bear to hear about all that you missed out on.

or B) You give up on the studying and join your friends. The FOMO was just too real.

If you go with A, it’s okay. You may feel like you missed out on the the most exciting and wonderful thing that has ever happened, but it’s college. There will be plenty more “best night ever”s.
If you chose B, don’t feel bad. The people who told you that these would be the best years of your life were right. It’s not the end of the world if you have to stay up a little later tomorrow night to make up for the reading you didn’t get to tonight. It was worth the experience with your friends, wasn’t it?

As the Common Core is being rolled out into public schools this year, increasingly more parents across multiple states — Ohio, New Mexico and New Jersey — are opting their children out of Common Core exams. Why? Because the Common Core is just another standardised test among a slew of others that detracts from learning in the classroom and ultimately facilitates teaching to the test.
Since the No Child Left Behind Legislation was passed by the Bush administration in 2001, the federal government has attempted to make schools more accountable for their students’ performance through standardized testing. The government’s intent was to ensure that all students would receive a quality education, regardless of income, district, or race. But despite evidence that standardised testing does not make education better, largely from the failure of No Child Left Behind, the Common Core is still being promoted by the government as a better alternative.
The main goal of the Common Core exams is to provide the government with statistical information on the standards of the nation’s education. Thus, students, such as Marina Ford, a sophomore interviewed by the Washington Post, are forced to spend “valuable weeks” studying for exams that “didn’t remotely have purpose.” She was forced to prioritize the Common Core exam over her AP exams, which have more purpose to students, namely to facilitate admission to college. Like online tests, Common Core exams are also vulnerable to glitches, such as unreliable Internet connection and log-on issues. Students have complained that the questions are often ambiguous or have errors, directing students to analyse paragraphs that don’t exist. Indeed, the Common Core has proven so unpopular that some schools are giving out incentives to students just to encourage participation in the exams.
Parents have a right to be concerned about the standards of their child’s education and opting out of the Common Core is their last ditch attempt to express their disapproval to a government which does not listen.
 
I disagree with you Sam.  The Common Core standards and the tests are a package deal, so I’m fine with the author lumping them together.
Bill Gates himself lumped them together when he said:  “When the tests are aligned to the common standards, the curriculum will line up as well—and that will unleash powerful market forces in the service of better teaching. For the first time, there will be a large base of customers eager to buy products that can help every kid learn and every teacher get better.”
Okay, so aligning tests to standards is normal and Bill Gates thinks raising the standards will lead to mass commodification of K-12 education or something. I disagree but that’s not important. You and the author are blasting tests based on common core as if there wasn’t already an equivalent test. California used STAR, other states used similar tests under different names. All of them were pointless to the students and used to give the schools and state performance data. But they were designed to identify the worst of problem schools, so most teachers didn’t feel the need to teach the test.
For some reason, states decided to make these tests far more difficult when realigning to common core standards. No one made them do this (except the anti-public education lobby). Yes, the new standards are higher than the outdated state standards (which I hope everyone wants) but in theory nothing was stopping states from doing away with the tests entirely. The new tests are a product of the crusade for “greater accountability” and the wider efforts to discredit and destroy public education. Common core is just the boogeyman to distract everyone from what’s really happening.
Lots of misinformation here. First off, Common Core is a set of standards for English and mathematics teaching. It’s not a test, though many states have chosen to develop tests based on the standards. Then there’s the fact that common core wasn’t developed by the federal government. It was developed on behalf of a coalition of state governors and later endorsed by Arne Duncan.
Since the entire basis of this post was blatant misinformation, the rest falls apart. “The main goal of the Common Core exams is to provide the government with
 statistical information on the standards of the nation’s education”? How does that work, when distinct tests are created and administered by groups of states? And when every state uses tests to measure how schools are doing, the problem of pointless testing has nothing to do with what standards are in place.
So I’d encourage people to check the facts on this matter, as well as the sensationalism of the final sentence.
