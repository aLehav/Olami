Despite an early start time and a crushing defeat for USC, the Homecoming game against Stanford on Saturday brought in more sales to the USC Pertusati bookstore than expected, though not as much as last year.
The bookstore made about $300,000 on Homecoming day, and approximately $550,000 over the entire weekend.
In previous years, the bookstore averaged about $1,000 in sales per minute during peak Homecoming hours; this year, sales topped out at $930 per minute.
Daniel Archer, director of the bookstore, said part of the reason for the decline in sales might have been the early kickoff. A 12:30 start, he said, meant customers didn’t have much time to purchase merchandise beforehand.
But more customers than usual purchased bookstore merchandise after the game, which Archer attributed to the unfortunate results.
“Sadly, it’s ironic … So many people left the game and our store was really busy,” Archer said. “It’s almost like retail therapy.”
Archer said once “disenchanted fans” left the Coliseum, they needed to do something else to distract themselves and found shopping at the bookstore a good option.
Archer said this accounted for the unusually strong sales during the second half of the day — that is, about $50,000 in sales from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Though sales were still down from last year’s Homecoming, Archer said sales were actually higher than anticipated, which he partially attributed to the recovering economy.
Overall, Archer was pleased with the results of bookstore sales, saying they were “very comparable to … last year,” and that it was a successful Homecoming weekend for the bookstore.

While fans cheered on the USC basketball team Tuesday night at the Galen Center, across the street, players stole the spotlight on a different set of courts.
The courts there are a little more dingy, with tattered nets and a thin layer of sand covering the cement. There is no scoreboard and no announcer, and players compete under the yellow wash of lights mounted on the adjoining parking garage.
Hoops · Local residents frequently play basketball at the courts across from the Galen Center. The courts are used almost every night, but often remain vacant during the day. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
But even though these courts aren’t nearly as ornate or well-kept as the Galen Center — or even the courts in the Lyon Center, for that matter — the games they host might be more important for USC’s image than those in either of the other venues.
The two basketball courts located on the edge of campus — nestled between Gate 3, Figueroa Street and Parking Structure X — have become a mecca of sorts for basketball enthusiasts over the years. Though the courts are close to the freshmen dorms and sometimes attract USC students, a different crowd comes out to play at night: people who live in the neighborhood.
“You get a good workout up here,” said 19-year-old Wayne McIntyre, who lives near campus. “I come here because I [see] the homies and I like playing basketball.”
McIntyre and his friends play basketball on the courts regularly — he said he comes to campus “every other day.” There’s always someone on the courts in the evenings, he said, especially on the weekends.
“There’s always competition,” he said.
But competition marks every basketball court. What sets these courts apart, players said, is that here — unlike elsewhere in South Los Angeles — the competition doesn’t get out of hand.
“Elsewhere people are getting mad regularly,” said Clifford Warrn, a 20-year-old who plays on the USC courts daily. “Not so much here. There’s really no arguing — nobody’s causing trouble.”
“You can’t say the same thing about other courts,” McIntyre said.
There’s something else uncommon about the outdoor courts: Although they are on campus and near many freshmen dorms, they are usually vacant during the day. They don’t come alive until 6 or 7 p.m., when the lights on the parking garage flicker on and players trickle in from different directions — mostly from outside of USC’s gates. Many students say they go elsewhere on campus to play basketball and rarely think about these courts.
Anand Abraham, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, said he has never played basketball on the outdoor courts. He usually plays at Cardinal Gardens or at the Lyon Center, even though he said the latter is “always crowded.”
“They’re just closer to me,” Abraham said.
Though Daryl Trotter, a junior majoring in architecture, has played basketball on the courts with his friends from the surrounding neighborhood for the past three and a half years, he said he doesn’t see too many other students around. Still, Trotter said, it would not be a problem if students were to visit the courts more often.
“People over here wouldn’t even care,” Trotter said. “I think it’d actually be cool.”
Bruce Morrissette, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said he used the courts last year and most of the other players were not USC students. Although some students might have negative misconceptions about the neighborhood surrounding USC and the people who live near the university, Morrissette said he had no problems playing basketball with players who weren’t students.
“I always thought it was fine,” he said. “I really didn’t see any problems. People got a little into it sometimes, but that’s just competition.”
For Trotter, the courts are the place where his friends in the neighborhood can feel like they’re part of the USC community.
“A lot of people also come here because it’s up at ’SC. People who are fans of ’SC sports like to come here and ball and play sports at the ’SC courts,” he said. “It makes them feel at home.”
Still, some of the regulars said it’s not about the relationship between USC and the neighborhood, and it doesn’t matter who shows up to the courts.
“If they can play, they can play,” Warrn said. “It doesn’t matter.”
I graduated from SC when the courts were where the McCarthy Quad now is. I had a great time playing there against neighborhood kids, SC football players, SC women’s basketball players and totally uncoordinated SC freshman. It was a great mixture, then as now mostly kids “from the hood”, but it was a great learning experience for me as well.
To “parenr” and “USCDad”: I have a simple solution: Pepperdine exists. Great location, good education, none of the big city problems. Send your kids there. Please don’t try to turn us into Pepperdine.
You will be the very same niave parent that willl throw a fit when if anyjting every happened to you child.  You are the one who actually sounds quite ignorant of the facts.
Dear “parent”:
Your post reeks of fear and ignorance, not to mention racism. Not every kid who lives near USC is a criminal. My daughter is a junior and lived in Pardee as a freshman. She never had a problem with local residents using the courts in the evening, nor did I ever have any cause for concern. Why do some people feel the need to stir up trouble for no good reason? Furthermore, if you can’t spell you should have someone proofread your posts before you submit them. Your poor spelling is evidence of your own lack of education.
This is a recipe for diaster!  A litany of situations can and will arise from having non students competing in heated scenarios on USC basketball courts!  We as parents pay 50k plus a year for our kids to be secure and safe.  USC courts should be for USC kids end of subject.  All of  the bleeding heart liberals that are so predisposed to constantly reaching out to be inclusive of the community around USC will be the same individuals that will roll their eyes up in their head and throw their arms up in the air upon some unfotunate incident at the hands of an outsider invading our school property and perpetuating a violent crime agaisnt a student!.
If history hasnt taught us anything USC needs to purchuse all of the housing around campus and errect school boundires.   Similar to what Brown & Columbia and Brown have done encompassing thier campuses for safty reasons!  Then anyone who is not supposed to on campus will be querried and asked to leave.  Until such action is taken our kids will continue to be shot, stabbed, rapped and beaten up.  But we have our kids paying top price for the privildge of being at USC and being  forced on an ongoing daily basis to live amoungst some of the worst element that Los Angles has to offer.  Great now lets encourage heated competition with kids that are underprivildged have a chip on their shoulders and do not have the same resouces, educationally or monitarilaly.  Our goal is to educate our kids that have been fortunate enough to have been chosen one of 2400 kids out of the 50,000 that have appiled to attend this prestiegious school not to baby sit and be and out reach program for the less fortunate these kids are forced to cohabitate with while securing such a desirable education! .
  Sounds like a pot waiting to boil over to me!  But what do i know?

The Department of Public Safety and LAPD will be conducting a second bike traffic enforcement effort today, despite sentiment from many students that the first crackdown was ineffective and unfair.
The crackdown on bike traffic will focus on the intersections on Jefferson Boulevard at Hoover Street and at McClintock Avenue. It will mirror the enforcement effort on Sept. 18, when LAPD gave out about 120 traffic citations, according to DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas.
Ticket to ride · An LAPD officer issues a traffic citation to at student by the intersection of McClintock Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard during LAPD’s Sept. 18 traffic enforcement crackdown. LAPD will again be ticketing in droves on Wednesday. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
Since then, Thomas said, LAPD officers have sporadically come to campus and ticketed students, but Wednesday’s enforcement will be the first concentrated effort since September. Still, Thomas said he hopes the periodic citations have helped decrease the number of offenders.
“We’re expecting them to write fewer tickets this time, meaning the behavior is changing and students are at least more mindful,” Thomas said. “If we write more of the same number we’re not having the impact we need to see.”
Despite Thomas’ optimism, many students said they have not noticed a difference in biking habits.
“People still ride against the traffic and in the intersections and they just hope they don’t get caught,” said Jeremiah Forkkio, a junior majoring in business administration.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle, however, said the occasional citation efforts, even if they don’t make a noticeable change, help prevent collisions and other bike safety issues.
“If we don’t occasionally take action to impound bikes or give tickets the problems get worse and worse,” Carlisle said. “When the resources allow it, we need to keep some control and order with the traffic flow.”
Some students said they do not think it is worthwhile for LAPD to dedicate time and resources to patrolling the intersections.
“It seems like LAPD has a lot more problems it could be dealing with than if USC students are walking their bikes in the crosswalks,” said Alicia Johnson, a junior majoring in French and neuroscience.
But Thomas noted that it is LAPD’s South Traffic Division that enforces these traffic laws, and one of its primary tasks is ensuring traffic safety.
“Students say the officers can be doing something more important, but traffic safety is one of the most important quality of life issues in the city of Los Angeles,” Thomas said. “We have two of the most problematic intersections in our division, so it’s a good use of South Traffic Division’s resources.”
Other students argued that the cost of the citations is too steep given the magnitude of the violation.
Rachel Fuhrman, a sophomore majoring in international relations, was given a $212 ticket in September for failing to obey posted traffic control signals. But Fuhrman argued the signs were not clear enough.
“There was a sign that said, ‘Walk bike in crosswalk,’ which is pretty much illegible because the ‘bike’ part is graffitied out,” Fuhrman said. “It just says, ‘Walk in the crosswalk.’”
Fuhrman said she thinks tickets should be given just to students who are biking
dangerously. She does not think students should be ticketed for coming to a near stop and then slowly entering the crosswalk.
Still, Thomas said, officials must consider pedestrian safety when deciding whether or not to ticket.
“The crosswalk is an extension of the sidewalk,” Thomas said. “But with the number of bikers causing the people walking to get out of the bicyclists’ way, we consider that disregard for the safety of others.”
Thomas noted, however, that most of the citations issued were not for biking through the crosswalks, but for riding in the wrong direction.
Geoff Montgomery, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said he received a $174 ticket for biking against the flow of traffic. Montgomery plans to appeal the ticket in court, however.
“I think the city realizes that by making students jump through hoops, a lot of kids will just pay for it to avoid the hassle,” Montgomery said. “It would be one thing if it were a $30 bike ticket but it’s more than some speeding tickets that my parents have gotten.”
Despite students’ wariness of the enforcement efforts, Carlisle said they are worthwhile if they make even a small difference — and he thinks they have.
“We have noticed students walking their bikes in the crosswalk at Jefferson and McClintock and that may not have been the case in recent years,” Carlisle said. “It may be a small incremental increase in compliance but if that makes fewer accidents then we’re happy.”
Good Luck Mrs. Kendall this endevour of your is a three headed monster and no one wants tot take responsibility.  Maybe we can get students to volunteer to tell  other students to safetyly walk their bikes…they would quit after one lunch time rush and after a few flip off and FU’S;(
It seems like Mrs. Kendall and Sustainable Streets wants to take this responsibility.  I do not believe flip-offs and FUs would help this problem.
I am a USC parent and board member of Sustainable Streets, a non profit which aims to make Los Angeles more bicycle and pedestrian friendly. A month ago I wrote campus police suggesting that our organization, which provides bicycle safety and urban cycling classes, develop a curriculum for USC students.  It would be wornderful if we could convince students that riding the wrong way down the street wearing flip flops without a helmet while talking on a cell phone is a dumb idea.
Enforcement of bicycle laws can be effective at increasing safety, primarily if it focuses on real safety hazards.  But we need to make sure students know how to cycle safely, and we need to redesign the campus and surrounding streets to accommodate the high volumes of pedestrians and cyclists they carry. Most importantly, we want to ENCOURAGE biking…its a healthy, fun, clean and ideal transportation mode.
I love this solution.  Teaching bicycle safety while also redesigning streets to accommodate both pedestrians and bicyclists.
It seems that USC discourages bicycling, though.  Unnoticed by many students, at Gate 5 there is a sign which prohibits bicycles from entering.  The only legal way for a bicycle to enter through Gate 5 is by walking through the crosswalk, then getting onto the sidewalk, which does not afford enough space for both bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
shouldn’t lapd be focused on stopping hit and run on adams?
if USC students were more active in their community, they would take the city of LA to court for unfair practices  – this is the same with parking tickets. parking enforcers are always on time only at usc.
only at usc will you see lapd bring a chopper to break up a party on the row.
The only problem is that this is difficult to prove in court.
Sorry guys but the days of student bicycle terror on the USC campus are limited…and OMG you may have to walk a hundred yards to get to class…
We’re not talking about getting to class. We’re talking about crossing a street.
@ Cory
You’re close, but not quite right mostly because of LAMC 56.15 which says, “No person shall ride, operate or use a bicycle, unicycle, skateboard, cart, wagon, wheelchair, rollerskates, or any other device moved exclusively by human power, on a sidewalk, bikeway or boardwalk in a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.”
Many cities do in fact prohibit riding bikes on sidewalks, but LA is not one of them.  They have decided to allow it.  Crosswalks, in this case, are extensions of the sidewalk, not the roadway and so it is not correct to cite portions of the CVC governing bicycle use in a roadway.
The LAMC refers to the manner in which the cyclist is riding.  The LAPD has instead invented a standard of “there are numerous pedestrians” rather than assessing whether the bicyclist is operating in a safe and respectful manner.  On the pedestrian signal, pedestrians have and should have the right of way, but that does not mean it is not possible to ride respectfully and safely, particularly if one enters the vehicle lane on McClintock.
That said, it will always be safer for bicyclists to ride on the roadway (in the same direction as traffic) and use the vehicle signals.  If LAPD were interested in increasing bike safety, they would be instructing students to do this as they write their tickets.
We need to figure out an engineering solution to make both the Hoover and McClintock intersections safer for bikes and peds.  But with ambiguous and inappropriately applied laws, enforcement is not actually addressing the problem.
well according to Jeremiah Forkkio who’s quoted in the article  “People still ride against the traffic and in the intersections and they just hope they don’t get caught,” and  DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas who’s also noted states “most of the citations issued were not for biking through the crosswalks, but for riding in the wrong direction”.  If they cited for that, then it would be a violation of California Vehicle Code (CVC)  21650.1.  which states:
” A bicycle operated on a roadway, or the shoulder of a highway, shall be operated in the same direction as vehicles are required to be driven upon the roadway”. A Sidewalk is an extention of the roadway.
Also for other bike laws check CVC 21200(a). That alone states that bicyclist are subject to the same rules that motorist do.  There’s a lot of things that are illegal and I see it all the time.  Having earphones on while bicycling, not stopping for the stop sign, going the wrong way etc. There’s cities who have local municipal codes agaisnt riding a bike on the sidewalk.
I’m an avid bicycler. I don’t like getting tickets, that’s why I take time to study the law and find out what’s illegal.  The information is out there, all you have to do is research it.  As University students it shouldn’t be that hard for us to do.

this is definitely not the most pressing issue in L.A., but does deserve attention.
False.
Crime in this area is a non-issue. Proof: I have not been robbed.
So, get the students on their bikes.
The cops are completely right in ticketing people biking through crosswalks. I would suggest that they set up a substation there to completely make biking a hassle 24/7 instead of the measly 2 or 3 hours that they did today.
This is without a doubt the most pressing issue in the area, maybe even in LA. A few kids might get brushed by a bike, and this demands an LAPD presence.
I, personally, also believe that bikes should have to walked when on the sidewalk. I’ve talked to some that say that bikes should be walked at all times, and although I am not yet of that opinion, it has some good arguments.
“… LAPD should similarly ticket walkers for disregarding the path of cyclists”
I have to disagree with this. We’re focusing on the enforcement of laws right now and pedestrians have the right of way on sidewalks. Bikes have to yield to them. If pedestrians on the sidewalk or crosswalk are annoying you, then ride your bike as a vehicle on the street and wait for the green light.
“The crosswalk is an extension of the sidewalk,” Thomas said. “But with the number of bikers causing the people walking to get out of the bicyclists’ way, we consider that disregard for the safety of others.”
If the crosswalk is an extension of the sidewalk, than bicyclists should be allowed to bike across the intersection.
And if bikers are getting ticketed for disregarding the safety of walkers, than the LAPD should similarly ticket walkers for disregarding the path of cyclists.
Many of the people cited are not breaking any laws. THERE IS NO LAW saying that bikes cannot ride in a crosswalk. Crosswalks are an extension of the sidewalk and the LAMC gives bikes the right to ride on the sidewalks in a safe manner. If the cyclists are being reckless to those around them (I know plenty of riders that are), then they deserve to be ticketed.
Saying it’s illegal to ride in a crosswalk is completely false and misinformation. I really wish the DT would read the corresponding municipal and vehicle codes and report on that. That would do more good for the community.
Cory- which law is this that the students have broken?
you guys need to stop whining.  this is the LAPD traffic division. that’s their job to enforce traffic laws. bicyclist aren’t excempted from the law. it sucks that some of you got tickets, but that’s the law.
as far as LAPD riding a brand new BMW motorcycle, good for them.  they need their old bikes replaced, just like their patrol cars. their equipment wears out with time like anything else.
don’t want to get a ticket, stop breaking the law and follow the rules.  simple. hopefully some of you will get the picture.
We live in one of the worst crime areas in the country. Doesn’t LAPD have some gangs or a drug ring to deal with? Just because the state of California is facing a $21 billion deficit doesn’t mean that USC students are responsible for helping them pay it off. Just yesterday, I saw an LAPD officer riding a brand new BMW motorcycle. So glad LAPD uses our bike ticket money so effectively.
Sorry, Chris.
The yellow-on-black signs are not enforceable on speed limit signs as they are advisory signs.
Yellow signs that are not related to speed limits are still very enforceable.
Nice try, though.
“Still very enforceable,” is gray. It either is, or is not. “Very” is not definite.
I’ve watched this go on and off for years, it’s always a sad spectacle, and ultimately very disrespectful of USC. But then USC Students are the easiest targets in South Los Angeles, as witnessed by recent events. Picked on by USC Security and the local police, abandoned by the USC Administration, they are just dollar bills with tennis shoes, right?
The truth of the matter is; it’s not just the increased revenue that’s attractive, but that LA Traffic Cops like to talk to USC Co-Eds. I’ve seen it happen over and over again.
As a longtime area resident, I’ve seen too many traffic accidents that involve pedestrians and/or cyclists.
I don’t want the students to feel harassed by LAPD, and frankly, we need to redesign some of the streets and throughways to be safer for other-than-autos, but in the meanwhile, students really need to look out for themselves on our streets.  Riding against traffic, with a cellphone or Ipod, inebriated, no lights, no helmet, etc – is a recipe for permanent disability or death.
LAPD enforcement of good practices may seem a bit fascist, but tickets are totally avoidable if you simply follow the law.
There’s a big difference in upholding the law frivolously, and looking at the big picture. Being frivolous is when you go 2 mph over the speed limit, and Mr. police officer decides to give you a ticket just because he can. Frivolous is also when California is in a economic crunch, along with the rest of the country, so the city of Los Scandalous decides to find ways to generate revenues via giving USC students $485–that’s right–$485 moving violation tickets for riding your bike across the Jefferson and Hoover cross.
I think DPS and LAPD need to focus on the BIG PICTURE. You know, kind of like preventing the 2 recent tragic events?
Listen, giving out $500 tickets to students for trivial “bicycle infracions”doesn’t slow down the reckless drivers speeding to hit students like bowling pins, nor does it stop the thugs from acting violently.
I’m disgusted!
I completely agree. My son was given a $436 ticket for riding his bike through the same crosswalk. He tried to fight it and it was finally reduced to about $275. He decided to do community service instead of paying the fine, but now I’m worried about where he will have to do the community service in such a bad area, because the LAPD seems more concerned with ticketing USC students instead of spending their time dealing with real crimes in the area. I think the real reason the police officers are targeting the students is because California’s state budget is in the tank and they figure most USC students can afford to have their parents pay the high fines. He also received a ticket for not having a bike light on his bicycle. He got a bike light, and then had to ride to a separate inspection site to make sure he put the bike light on his bike. Additionally he had to pay another fine for having the inspection and a fine to “release” (the court’s wording) the infraction.
Hey guess what! Yellow signs aren’t legally binding. I did my drivers’ ed homework; they are nothing more than “recommendations.” If you’re citing people for disobeying them, you could fight those and win.
I’m still just.. outraged at this. I know you’re supposedly worried about safety, but you might stop a few scratches but pick up $10,000 in citations. Interesting ratio, that. Pull over just a couple speeding cars, and you’ll do more for safety. Pick up one armed robber, and you’ve done even more for safety. College kids on bikes? This is just pathetic. Sack up.

In South Africa, a race is under oppression, lashing out violently against the harsh constraints placed upon it. In the midst of these clashing sides, one man is drawn into the events. These are the ingredients for one of the year’s most compelling films.
No, not District 9. I’m talking about Endgame.
Secrets and lies · Chitwetel Ejiofor stars as Thabo Mbeki in Pete Travis’ Endgame, which centers around the South African apartheid. - Photo courtesy of Target Entertainment
The latest film from Pete Travis, who directed the lackluster Vantage Point, Endgame is a thriller based on events from the end of the South African apartheid.
In 1985, as Nelson Mandela (Clarke Peters) is locked up in prison, Michael Young (Jonny Lee Miller) is sent by his company, Consolidated Goldfields, to organize secret negotiations in England between the white Afrikaner government and the African National Congress. Leading the representatives of each side, respectively, are Professor Will Esterhuyse (William Hurt) and director of information Thabo Mbeki (Chitwetel Ejiofor).
Apartheid is a crumbling policy, and the main goal of both sides is to control the endgame. Will South Africa explode in violence or is there a middle ground that can be reached?
Endgame is a wonderful example of a modern-day thriller. Rather than fabricate conspiracies or plots, Travis sticks to the true events of the negotiations, using the mutual mistrust to build tension and suspense. Even to those who know South African history, the film is never predictable.
Historical events have a tendency to be adapted into stifling, emotionally bland films, but Endgame breaks that trend. The events portrayed in the film are ones in which fear, anger and hope play key roles. The film does not shy away from these feelings, but embraces them. As a result, it creates one of the most compelling and engaging narratives in the past year.
The negotiations between the two parties compose the crux of the story, but Travis avoids letting it devolve into mundane boardroom conversations. Both sides have plans, along with prejudices and fears. For the government to ease back on its tactics would mean an end to their political power; for the ANC to halt its terrorist attacks would be seen as surrendering to the powers that be.
Each party struggles not only to work with each other, but with their own allies. Mbeki works to stop violent reprisals from the ANC that could undermine the talks, while Esterhuyse faces threats from extremist Afrikaners, all the while being forced to report on the negotiations to the head of government intelligence, Dr. Niel Barnard (Mark Strong), who also is working on breaking Mandela’s resolve.
Endgame relies heavily on its cast to deliver the tension and drama, and the actors do not disappoint. Hurt and Ejiofor immerse themselves in their roles, both perfectly mastering their South African accents. Ejiofor in particular shines as Mbeki, a man who has the weight of the world on his shoulders and is constantly on the verge of failing. The chemistry between Esterhuyse and Mbeki feels real, and the two develop a respect for each other over time.
Strong, who has proven to be a master at playing villains and shady individuals in Sunshine and Body of Lies, maintains a captivating and chilling presence as Neil.
Even the supporting actors shine. Peters captures the serene determination of Mandela, fighting doubt and temptation while being cut off from the ANC. Derek Jacobi gives a strong, brief performance as Young’s boss, whose ultimate motives for organizing the negotiations are shrouded in secrecy.
After the gimmick-heavy Vantage Point, Endgame has a much more grounded style. The film relies not on shock twists or sudden scares, but on a slow burn of tension, which flares up into pulse pounding car chases across the country side and marketplace attacks. This is truly an edge-of-your-seat film.
Although it is a look at the end of apartheid, Endgame’s themes hold weight in today’s world. The film is a powerful example of the benefits of overcoming fear and extremism to pursue compromise. The questions of national security versus oppression and terrorism versus freedom fighting can be applied to the Iraq war.  Endgame is both a brilliant historical thriller and a topical look at the power of compromise.
These days, thrillers tend to include big explosions or convoluted conspiracies. Endgame is a prime example of a thriller that is twice as compelling and suspenseful without those tropes.
In a year of giant robots, alien invasions and over-the top-action films, the realism, drama and slow-burning tension in Endgame are not only powerfully compelling but also a fresh breath of relief.
Not much else to say:  A quality review.  Concise, balanced and thoughtful…  A movie based on its own merits, rather than “tropes”, as it was put so well, relegates demogogues, and the biast to the rally within their own silence, and allows the audiance to think for themselves…    Very finely written…  Hope the flick is as well done…

If senior guard Dwight Lewis is to be the team leader and go-to scorer for the USC men’s basketball team, coach Kevin O’Neill and the Trojans will be expecting performances like this all year.
Lewis led the Trojans (1-0) with a game-high 20 points on 7-of-14 shooting and added three rebounds in the Trojans’ 77-67 victory over UC Riverside at the Galen Center Tuesday night.
Fast break · Senior Dwight Lewis got USC out of the gate fast against UC Riverside, scoring 20 points in the Trojans’ 77-67 win on opening night. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
After the Trojans lost four of their five starters from last season, Lewis was expected to take the role of the Trojan’s leader — and in the first game of his final season, Lewis delivered.
Lewis hit on his first three attempts from the field, helping USC sprint to an early 28-11 lead midway through the first half. The Trojans gave some ground back to the Highlanders (0-2) late in the first half, however — going nearly five minutes without a field goal — and led by 13 entering halftime.
Foul trouble plagued the Trojans early in the game, as both junior guard Marcus Simmons and redshirt junior forward Kasey Cunningham — who would eventually foul out — were forced to miss large portions of the first half because of foul trouble.
Lewis and sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic, who finished the game with 18 points and eight rebounds, picked up the slack late in the half and kept the Highlanders at a distance.
Defense played a key role all game, as the Trojans were able to neutralize former Trojan Kyle Austin, holding the junior to eight points.
No Highlander scored more than 12 points. The Trojans also forced 15 Highlander turnovers.
After Lewis cooled off, the Highlanders pulled the score to within eight points midway through the second half, but Simmons, one of four Trojans scoring in the double-digits, scored 11 of his 18 points in the second half, including six unanswered to extend the lead to 14. The Trojans never looked back.
“He dominated the game for us on both ends for one stretch and had some great hustle plays,” O’Neill said of Simmons.
Starting his first career game at point guard, redshirt junior Donte Smith scored 12 points, the most he has scored in a Trojan uniform, and quarterbacked the Trojan offense effectively while playing all 40 minutes of the game.
Although Smith committed five turnovers, after the game O’Neill took responsibility for Smith’s mistakes and praised his good play.
“It was my bad play calling. Two of those turnover are my responsibilities,” O’Neill said. “For a guy who hasn’t played any point guard and for him to play 40 minutes really says something about him.”
In a game in which the Trojans never trailed, a variety of the team’s new faces were able to get some playing time, most notably freshman forward Evan Smith, who contributed five points off the bench in his first career appearance. The play of the newcomers gave O’Neill cause for hope.
“For the most part, I think our whole team played well tonight,” O’Neill said. “I’m more than happy with any win, but we have to get better as a group.”

Do you remember when you were five, maybe six, and held an empty pickle jar as if it were as big as the world? And it was once, cradled within the intimate embrace of your innocent touch, this gaping expanse entwined with naïve hope and small, clenched fingers.
You scampered amidst giggles and lost breaths and warm summer nights, jar held high, collecting the little flickers of meandering dreams your father once called lightning bugs. But you knew what they were, really. Them and that pickle jar, your dreams and the world. Because magic happened; magic always happened.
And you knew when you were five, maybe six, that you were holding it when you lifted the jar to the waning moon to see those flickering lights go on and off and on again — always on again.
I wish I were five again. Or maybe six. Because when I was younger, it was easy for me to smile at those lightning bugs trapped inside my dusty pickle jar, unscrew the thin, metallic cap and set them free.
There are very few lightning bugs in Los Angeles. As of yet, I haven’t seen a meadow vibrant with flickering lights — but at the wee hour of 1 a.m. on an early Tuesday morning, I found myself on a chaotic Malibu beach with some flickering lights of its own.
The open sky was our pickle jar. Like the dozens of other people there, we lay on our backs and watched the dancing sky — we watched meteors burst left and right, blazing moments of brilliance and rapture falling gracefully and disappearing silently. We lifted our hands and watched them fall into our very grasp only to vanish moments later. There we were, hands above our hands and pointed to the waning moon — and even though that pickle jar eluded our small fingers, we still knew it was magic of its own — the brilliant kind.
As I grew older, I became more doubtful and bitter toward the pickle jar collecting dust in the far left corner of my garage. Was it selfish of me to want those flickering lights, to close the lid with pinprick holes and place it at my window to compliment the moonlight shining in? My father had always told me to let them go, but I grew a little too greedy and once, when I was seven, snuck back into the house with a pickle jar full of glowing lights, cap snapped closed.
The next morning, I expected my new glittering friends to be waiting, suspended in that pickle jar. But in the light of day, there was no rush of light, no dwindling calm, no breath of a fresh world. Only the rough, raw sounds of forgotten remains, restlessly rubbing against the confines of smeared glass.
That’s the thing about remembering and brilliance, I learned. Of unscrewing that thin, metallic cap and letting go while you can.
It’s funny how things like flashing lights and streaking glimmers of radiance place the world in your hands and then, years later, somewhere in the eternal expanse above our heads. During a meteor shower, you don’t get the chance of capturing those flickering lights in an empty, dusty pickle jar — there is no risk of a selfish embrace destroying the dancing lights you only hoped to keep for yourself. But those moments, like those lightning bugs, will always be ephemeral. Temporary.
You know when you lie down on a beach in Malibu that you will be watching a few rushing moments of rapture — nothing more, nothing less. And even if you know that those meteors will return to you one day — perhaps, sometime in the next year — this is it. This is your only time to enjoy it, to relish in it, so you do.
One of my roommates, a girl who never fails to see the warmth in all things, joked that we were all taking time away from our schedules to “witness the universe.” As we stared up into the blistering night sky, we did just that — we all commented on our meager brevity but also on the amazing knowledge that despite any flaws, mistakes or corruption, unyielding beauty can still surround us.
So to all of you concerned with the forks in your roads, unscrew that thin, metallic cap, watch the lights streak across the sky and jiggle the world, just a little. I promise those lights will find their way back to you.

Any student that has influential older siblings or a youthful affinity for music should remember Everclear, the band that dominated the ’90s alternative rock scene with hits like “Father of Mine” and “Santa Monica.”
But those who can remember Everclear’s success might also question what happened to the band that was once a regular name on popular radio stations and MTV. Much of the band’s fame seemed to silently fade away during the early 2000s as it was dropped from Capitol Records, and its loud, guitar-driven style of alternative rock began to lose popularity.
Father of mine · At age 47, Art Alexakis — lead guitarist and vocalist of the popular ’90s band Everclear — is indifferent to success. Alexakis is the only remaining member of the Portland, Ore. band’s original lineup. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
Now, the band is attempting a resurgence. As the only remaining original member, lead singer Art Alexakis recently hired a new backing band, recorded an album and ventured on a three-week tour throughout the United States to reconnect with an otherwise lost audience, stopping to play The Roxy in West Hollywood Thursday night — the band’s first performance at the venue since 1998.
Although Everclear has significantly declined in popularity during the past decade, Alexakis is unfazed.
“[Popularity] is nice because it helps pay the bills,” Alexakis said, before bluntly adding, “But I don’t really give a shit.”
Indifference to popularity is often seen among struggling and successful artists, but Alexakis genuinely means it.
He’s not uncomfortable with discussing his future.
“If it gets to the point where I have to do something else, I’ll do it with absolutely no unhappiness whatsoever,” he said.
Alexakis certainly has the credentials and talent to succeed outside of Everclear, as he briefly attended UCLA’s film school and continues to work as a writer, director and actor in the film industry.
Still, he has numerous passions outside the music industry.
“I want to finish my psychology degree and become a therapist someday,” he said.
Even though Alexakis is modest about his future, it became apparent as soon as Everclear began its concert Thursday night that he was exactly where he belongs: on stage. The band began its set with a noisy, driving song, “So Much for the Afterglow,” from its 1997 album of the same name.
Alexakis commanded the stage with high energy, an energy that didn’t fade throughout the band’s hour-and-a-half set. The club was fairly crowded, with a diverse audience ranging from younger fans to middle-aged people like Alexakis himself.
“It’s interesting to see a lot of people in their teens and early 20s, people in their late 20s and early 30s who were in college when we came up, and then older people at our shows. It’s an interesting cross section,” Alexakis said before the show.
His sentiments rang true during the set, as fans both young and old cheered loudly and sang along with the band’s hits.
Despite the wide range of supporters for Everclear, the band’s new album is a disappointment.
In a Different Light, released on the independent 429 Records in early October, features only two new songs: “At the End of the Day” and “Here Comes the Darkness.” Neither has earned significant radio time nor any other measurable form of success. The rest of the album features only stripped-down, acoustic versions of past hits such as “I Will Buy You a New Life” and “Everything to Everyone” that sound like cheap imitations of the original recordings.
Alexakis, speaking before his concert on Thursday, was quick to defend the album.
“I just wanted to document the way those songs have evolved over the years, and I had a lot of fans ask for us to go on a more acoustic route,” Alexakis said.
This may be the case, but the record has thus far failed to be as successful as the band’s previous albums.
Though In a Different Light provides softer, acoustic versions of the band’s well-known songs, the live show consisted of the hard-hitting guitars reminiscent of the band’s earlier years.
“We’re a rock ‘n’ roll band, man,” Alexakis said. “The guitars are there; we’re loud.”
The band followed through with this statement, playing piercing, electric guitar-driven versions of its hits throughout the set, as well as less popular songs from earlier albums such as Sparkle and Fade, which the crowd seemed to know just as well as the hits.
The four new members of the band, hired only months ago, seemed well-integrated and comfortable performing older songs. They leaned on Alexakis for support during jams, shared the microphone with the lead singer during choruses and took center stage during solos.
“We’re really lucky to get to play with [Art],” bassist Freddy Herrera said on stage.
But the new members weren’t the only people in Everclear that appeared lucky to be onstage. During the beginning of “At The End of the Day,” one of the new songs from In a Different Light, the entire band chanted “We will be together” over and over again, and the grin on Alexakis’s face made it seem as if that’s what he truly wanted.
Midway through the set, the band played “Volvo Driving Soccer Mom,” a song in which Alexakis sings lyrics such as I used to be a bad girl/ I used to be a real wild child/ but now I am a Volvo-driving soccer mom. Despite the gender-specific and fictional nature of the lyrics, the song has obvious autobiographical echoes.
“Most of the time I like to spend with my family,” Alexakis said. “I don’t tour as much as I used to.”
This might explain the relative lack of success attained by the new formation of Everclear, as Alexakis is simply taking his life slowly, enjoying himself and making sure he is able to raise his daughters differently than he was raised.
He referenced this desire to provide a better upbringing for his daughters from the stage.
“This song goes out to anyone who’s a better parent than their parents were to them,” he said before playing “Father of Mine,” a song about his father’s abandonment.
Although Everclear’s success has rapidly declined since the band’s peak in the mid-’90s, Alexakis seems content with his life.
“I’ve been very blessed,” Alexakis said. “I’ve achieved and exceeded every goal I’ve ever had.”
Alexakis may have slowed down since the band’s peak, but his commanding stage presence demonstrates that he has by no means become a complete “Volvo Driving Soccer Mom.”
As the band closed its set with a joyful crowd sing-along of “I Will Buy You a New Life,” it became apparent that Alexakis hasn’t given up on Everclear, and neither have his fans.

Today, many student cyclists will dismount and walk their bikes through the two major intersections along Jefferson Boulevard, under the threat of a ticket.
But tomorrow, they will most likely keep riding through.
Today marks only the second day this semester that Los Angeles Police Department and Department of Public Safety officers have made a significant push to patrol the Jefferson intersections at Hoover Street and McClintock Avenue, ticketing wayward students who don’t walk their bikes.
On Sept. 18, the first time they did it, LAPD gave out 120 tickets; DPS hopes that the number will be lower this time, as students will have learned their lesson. With such sparse shows of force, however, this is foolish optimism.
The department has, admittedly, had many problems enforcing the growing number of bikers on campus this year; its efforts to create any real change have been few and far between.
In September, DPS announced that it planned to start pushing bike security and safety, in part by impounding all bicycles not secured to racks. A month later, DPS admitted that it didn’t, in fact, have the resources to put this plan in action. Despite punctuated episodes of impoundment, such as Tuesday’s incident outside the Lyon Center, DPS has not had the capabilities to enforce any sweeping changes to campus bike regulation.
The Los Angeles Department of Transportation is currently pushing through an initiative to make the city more bike-friendly — including installing a bicycle lane on Adams Boulevard. With these efforts, the university needs to decide whether or not it will be a cyclist’s campus and act accordingly.
Intermittent tickets and impounding will do little to curb bikers’ careless riding. If DPS is serious about solving the problem, it needs to work with administrators and student leaders to make a strong statement about bike safety. This may mean putting more bike racks on campus or making the area a wheels-free zone altogether.
But one thing is for sure: Hollow displays of force promote a freewheeling attitude.
What is the violation they are citing when they ticket the cyclists who ride through the intersection? I’m unfamiliar with the “dismount” code, maybe there isn’t one. If they’re using the “ride with traffic” approach, the intersection is an extension of the sidewalk and there is no direction of traffic. What’s the violation?
There are yellow signs (with black legend) reading “Walk Bikes in Crosswalk.”  I believe cyclists are being cited for failing to follow these signs.
I like how bike riders being “careless” is the focus of the story. What responsibility does USC have to protect its own students? With the all-star lobbying team USC throws at local government each year, you’re telling me that they can’t wrest some pro-bike planning decisions for streets leading from student housing onto campus?
USC has to do an AQMD filing each year under Rule 2202 – to show how they are reducing green house gas emissions. Building massive parking lots and throwing hundreds of dollars in fees at bicycle riders doesn’t seem to jibe with what the school ought to be doing – calming traffic and making all the streets leading into campus “complete streets”.
For a school with so much intellectual capacity, this whole debacle makes the place look plain stupid.
[…] plans to change the face of biking in NELA. The Daily Trojan says lax police enforcement only encourages a freewheeling attitude among campus cyclists. According to Damien Newton, […]

If we believe the press, which impending obsolescence has converted into a bunch of nostalgic cultural critics bemoaning the way things are, then storytelling is in a bad way.
The long-form narrative is out, the 140-character Tweet is in.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Permit me to download — in small, snack-sized chunks — a few examples from recent columns.
Ben Macintyre of London’s The Times, in “The Internet is Killing Storytelling”: “The Internet has evolved a new species of magpie reader, gathering bright little buttons of knowledge, before hopping on to the next shiny thing.”
The Washington Post’s Joel Achenbach, in “The Vestigial Tale”: “Narrative these days competes against incrementalized information — data, chatter, noise.”
The Atlantic’s Nicholas Carr, in “Is Google Making Us Stupid?”: “The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle.”
Of course, I risk misrepresenting these fine writers by only excerpting parts of their pieces, but if what they say is true, our fried attention spans wouldn’t be able to handle much more (at least before checking our emails).
We need to step back. Is the Internet really rewiring our brains, to the point where we can’t read like we used to?
It’s a serious charge, certainly worth considering (more by neuroscientists than opinion columnists, I would think), but we should, before addressing it, also ask, when will the media let up on the Internet?
It seems the Internet is on a killing spree. Not only stories, but movies, music, print media and social interaction are all said to have been sacrificed, or at least wounded, by the Internet. It has become the scapegoat on which we comfortably place blame for every pop-cultural woe.
Lately, that woe has been the so-called death of the long-form narrative, perhaps the most serious charge of them all.
By narrative, I mean story — the very bedrock of culture. Students of USC’s venerable School of Cinematic Arts Professor Drew Casper might recall his frequent pontification on the importance of story to our spiritual well-being. Of course, he’s right.
“Life is all inclusion and confusion,” Casper said. “Story is discrimination and selection.”
Certain prophets in the media, however, believe we’re slowly losing our capacity to formulate stories. It’s the sound-bite syndrome. Give it to me in a sentence or less, or don’t give it to me at all.
Don’t buy it. Story-loving, as Achenbach puts it in “The Vestigial Tale,” is biology. Stories are the schemata into which we pour our experiences; in other words, we need them to make sense of the world. Culture would collapse if it weren’t built on some common foundation of storytelling.
Granted, the Internet is completely revamping the way things are, and as with every colossal step forward, there are steps back, repeatedly emphasized by a community of naysayers. The rest of us, far less vocal, see the Internet (quite correctly) as progress, opening up a world of possibilities.
History provides us with countless examples of people wondering whether the next big thing — the printing press or the radio — will irrevocably pervert human thought and ruin us all. Maybe some things have, maybe they haven’t, but we’re still here.
And we’re still reading.
The Internet isn’t narrative-killing. If anything, the Internet facilitates storytelling. In between Facebook updates, we might stumble upon a story of feral child in Plant City, or be alerted to the kidnapping and eventual rescue of a little girl in our neighborhood. These are stories with beginnings, middles and ends. We respond to them as we always have: with complete attention and deep emotion.
There is no substitute for the narrative. Twitter won’t replace it, and neither will Facebook nor the simplification of news into bite-sized tidbits. We instinctively know what makes a story, why some work and some don’t, and when we find a good one (whether it’s Harry Potter or a fine piece of journalism), we gobble it up whole. Because we crave them.
And that part of us cannot be tampered with.

A national study has found that a  gap exists between the experiences of transfers from four-year universities and those from community colleges. But USC’s approach to the transfer process has left only a small discrepancy between each type of transfers, according to many students.
The National Survey of Student Engagement, which includes students from both public and private colleges and universities nationwide, found that transfers from four-year institutions were more likely to participate in “high impact” activities, such as studying abroad and researching with a professor, than transfers from community colleges.
The study, commonly referred to as the “Nessie,” compared the experiences of “vertical” transfers, who are from community colleges, with those of “horizontal” transfers from four-year institutions. The study aimed to find out as much as possible about campus life, beyond just quantitative data.
“We want to change the nature of the conversation about college quality to focus on teaching and learning,” said Alexander McCormick, director of the survey and a professor at Indiana University School of Education’s Educational Leadership and Policy Studies department. “The quality discourse is really about US rankings, and about resources, and doesn’t tell you about what’s going on, on campus.”
But to understand how students are affected at schools like USC, some feel the study should factor in socioeconomic status, and say that is an important determinant of what kinds of activities a student will participate in.
“For a university like USC, the horizontal transfers are likely to be affluent,” said Alicia Dowd,
co-director of the USC Center for Urban Education.
This could have some effect on the results, Dowd said, since affluent students are more likely to study abroad and engage in similar activities that require extra expenses.
“The Nessie is really measuring only really small differences in behavior … They don’t tell us anything about the value of transfer as a whole,” Dowd said.
To help transfer students acclimate to USC, the school offers a separate orientation session for transfer students as well as programs that help specific groups  of transfers.
“The transfer orientation spends a good deal of time making sure that [transfer students] understand what they’ve been credited for,” said Tom Studdert, director of Orientation Programs at USC. “Also, at transfer orientation, we spend a little more time understanding the culture of student involvement at USC … [and] how it’s different from their previous institution.”
In addition to the separate orientation, USC’s SCholars program, funded by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, seeks out potential transfer students at local community colleges who are at a socioeconomic disadvantage, and tries to acclimate them to the USC campus before they apply. If they are accepted into the program, USC ensures that they find out about available opportunities on campus, said Kenechukwu Mmeje, the program’s director.
“Our community college students don’t know about these opportunities, and haven’t been introduced to them in a conventional way,” Mmeje said. “We have students participate in fellowships and scholarships, and it’s a result of our deliberate effort to expose students to those opportunities.”
Still, the SCholars program reaches out to only a limited number of students, and many transfers, from both two-year and four-year schools, feel USC should offer more programs to help them find out about resources available on campus.
Even so, many transfer students said they do not feel there is a large discrepancy in campus participation between transferring from a four-year university versus a community college.
“That’s not the case with me, and I’m a community college transfer,” said Kyle Young, an undeclared sophomore who transferred from Moorpark College. “I could definitely see that being true for other people. At a [junior college], it’s a lot less social. You don’t get to be part of your school spirit.”
Instead, many students from both two- and four-year schools say the real discrepancy in experiences is between transfer students and four-year students in general.
“I don’t feel like I know enough about the groups I can get involved with on campus, so that’s holding me back from participating in more organizations,” said Leher Pathak, a sophomore majoring in communication, who transferred from Loyola Marymount University.
Melanie Irinco, a sophomore majoring in public policy, planning and management who transferred from Los Angeles Valley College, also said she hadn’t been exposed to programs helping transfer students.
“I’m sure [the existing programs] are effective, but I would hope there would be more programs,” Irinco said. “Also, I wish they were easier to have access to or even just hearing about them would be nice.”
Whether they come from two- or four-year colleges, Dowd said, universities should make an extra effort to appreciate and assist transfer students to help them fit in on campus.
“USC has the largest number of transfers of any private university,” Dowd said. “We don’t celebrate that, and we should.”
No, the experience is not the same for junior college transfers vs. 4-year transfers. I don’t feel resetful that I, a JC transfer, wasn’t shown the ropes. That’s the loss you incur when transferring from a JC, you miss out on the first 2 years as a real undergraduate.
USC is unique in culture. There’s good and bad to this.  It’s not like a lot of other 4-years that are “normal.”
USC is just a stepping stone for me…It’s all good.

The dated cafeteria at the Sunshine Mission-Casa de Rosas, a nearby women’s shelter, turns out one hot meal per day for its residents — but rarely is that meal as bountiful as Wednesday’s Thanksgiving meal will be.
For the second year in a row after a brief hiatus, USC occupational therapy graduate students will volunteer their time at the mission, located at the corner of Hoover Street and Adams Boulevard, to put on a Thanksgiving dinner for the residents. This year, 20 students will go to the shelter and about 20 others will be helping with the planning, funding and food — far more than last year.
Ray of sunshine · Constance Hamilton works the reception desk at Sunshine Mission-Casa de Rosas. Hamilton also lives at the mission. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The dinners used to be an annual occurrence, but were halted in 2004 because of issues with the mission’s director, residents say.
“They used to do it in the past, but the lady that was before us, she didn’t want nobody to be here … So she kind of, like, pushed them away,” said Teryl Warren, a resident of the complex for 13 years.
Last year, occupational therapy students decided to bring the tradition back. Celso Delgado, the previous program coordinator and current residential advisor for Centennial Apartments, a building specifically for graduate occupational therapy students, led the push to reinstate the dinner, and is leading the charge again this year.
Delgado, now a doctoral student in the occupational therapy program, remembered the dinner from several years back and said he was surprised to learn that it hadn’t been put on since 2004.
“I was a master’s student in occupational therapy back in 2005, and when I was, I was the RA for this building back then,” Delgado said. “It was traditional to have that dinner at the Sunshine Mission, and … whoever the RA was, one of their responsibilities was to run it.”
About two weeks ago, Delgado began contacting his residents to gauge their interest in again putting on the annual Thanksgiving supper. After receiving an overwhelmingly positive response, Delgado began to delegate jobs to his residents.
To finance the event, Delgado sought funds from multiple sources, including URSC, Graduate, Upperclassman and Family building government and the Graduate and Professional Student Senate.
With the occupational therapy department donating four turkeys and most of the volunteers supplying one dish that they will prepare at home and bring to Casa de Rosas potluck-style, the Thanksgiving dinner is a collaborative effort.
Chrissy Kim, a graduate student studying occupational therapy who will participate in the event, said she is excited to be involved and tried to get as many people involved as possible.
“As the Community Service chair of the Graduate and Professional Student Senate and being an OT student, I tried to utilize my position to get as many graduate students of other disciplines involved into this great event,” Kim said. “Graduate students tend to stick to their discipline and are primarily involved in events hosted by their departments, but the community is best served by multi-disciplinary talents.”
Yecica Robles, the mission’s manager, said she is grateful for the work of the occupational therapy students, as the mission would be unable to host the dinner otherwise.
“The building is just going through hard times right now, financially,” Robles said.
Robles said Sunshine Mission has seen all of its government funding cut in recent years. The mission now relies on donations and revenue generated from the $306 monthly rent that residents of the Casa de Rosas complex’s single-occupancy apartments are charged.
Because of its limited funds, Sunshine Mission cannot currently afford to house any women in the upstairs portion of the main building. When times were better, women in need were offered accommodations for 30 to 90 days, allowing the women sufficient time to get back on their feet.
Casa de Rosas, a 55-unit residential complex configured to resemble a motel, was built in 1893 and has been designated a Historical Landmark by the City of Los Angeles.
The closely related Sunshine Mission has been operated from Casa de Rosas facilities since 1942, but its operations are distinct from Casa de Rosas’ in that the emergency housing and transitional living facilities Sunshine Mission provides to as many as 30 single homeless women are free of cost for up to 90 days.

With the 2010 Census coming up in March, USC students got involved Monday by attending a Census 2010 testing session that will determine whether or not they are eligible for a census job.
“For any government-related job there is an applicant exam,” said Nina Losorelli, assistant director of career services at the School of Policy, Planning and Development. “This is really the first stepping stone for applicants.”
The test consists of questions to gauge candidates’ clerical skills, reading and writing ability and organizational skills.
According to Losorelli, the school received 50 RSVPs from students. USC also did a census testing last spring, with about the same number of RSVPs.
The testing on campus is specifically for USC students who want to be involved in something close to the community, Losorelli said.
If students pass the exam, a number of jobs become available to them. The 2010 Census Bureau is hiring census takers, data compilers and office workers, according to Dave Gabor, a census manager in Los Angeles.
Any of these jobs, which involved knocking on doors to ask residents questions for the census, offer an opportunity for students to engage with the local community, Losorelli said.
“If they’re interested in civic engagement and getting involved in the community, this could help them gain experience in a public service,” Losorelli said.
Though these are paid, part-time jobs, Losorelli said she does not think students are in it just for the money.
“It’s a good mix of payment and a good time set-up, with flexible schedules,” she said. “It’s a great way to do something in between jobs and get paid while you’re giving back.”
The Census Bureau and the university have worked together to ensure that all of these part-time jobs are within walking distance, Losorelli said.
She added that it is typical for more students to get involved as the process continues and the actual census draws nearer.
“I think there’s a large population of students who are an active part of the community and want to be a part of this,” Losorelli said. “I think more will get involved, especially as we move into the spring semester.”
The census itself has an impact on a national level, because it helps determine how many representatives each state receives in Congress; the numbers collected in the census are used to allocate the 435 members of the House of Representatives to each of the states based on their populations.
“The more accurate a census, the more likely that your state is adequately represented,” said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. “It’s important that this census count is right, so it’s great to see students getting involved.”
Schnur added that the census also collects demographic information. Specific information about people living in an area, and not just the population, is factored into decisions that the government makes about allocation of resources at the local, state and federal levels.
“A great deal of government spending and resources are determined by the makeup of the population of areas,” Schnur said. “It attends to issues depending on what these ethnic, racial or cultural communities need.”

A discussion panel for students sought to raise awareness of the difficulties faced by the transgender community on campus, and attempted to teach students how to better relate to them.
“SpeakOUT: How to be a Trans Ally,” held by the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Assembly on Monday evening at the University Religious Center, offered students a personal talk from Natalie Camunas, an alumna who is an active proponent of the transgender community.
Marked ·Marshall Wilson, a junior majoring in international relations and history, participates in a talk about the transgender community. The talk, “SpeakOUT: How to be a Trans Ally,” was sponsored by the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Assembly. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“Often people from the gay and lesbian community don’t fully understand what it means to be trans,” said Vincent Vigil, director of the USC Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center. “We’re trying to engage in discussion about how we can, from with our own community, be more accepting of our trans people.”
Although the purpose of the event was to educate people about the transgender community, much of the talk was based on the personal experience of Camunas, who shared how she first became involved in the community: She dated someone who came out as transgender.
“It’s this rollercoaster ride — it’s scary,” Camunas said. “It’s difficult to let go of the person you were friends with, or who you dated.”
The informal talk people gave the audience of about 25, many of them members of GLBTA, a chance to ask questions about the transgender community. Points of discussion were the proper use of neutral pronouns — such as Ze, Hir, and Hirs — as well as other stories from attendees.
While there is still work to be done, said GLBTA Director Genevieve Flores, a senior majoring in psychology, USC is slowly acknowledging the transgender community.
“The new Campus Center is going to have gender neutral bathrooms,” Flores said.
Still, few students know how to relate to the transgender community, Camunas said. She spoke to the audience about how to be a good ally — someone who identifies themselves as straight, but supports the LGBT community — namely by stopping transphobia.
“That’s the number one thing; Just talk about it,” Camunas said. “Be an ally. If you hear something that doesn’t sound right to you, then say something. The more you do it, it puts you in a position of power.”
Allies have a very important role in the LGBT community, Vigil said, because if the LGBT community pushes their issues to LGBT students, they’re usually just preaching to the choir.
“It always become a gay issue — ‘Oh, those gays are arguing about such and such,” Vigil said. “But if they see a straight person supporting our cause, they might ponder and think, ‘Maybe I should give this a second thought.’”
A number of students who attended the event said they walked away with more knowledge about the treatment of the transgender community than before.
“You only hear about gay and lesbian issues, sexual orientation and not so much gender,” said Anthony Gaytan, a sophomore majoring in East Asian languages and cultures.
Meanwhile, other students also approved of the talk’s informality, which allowed the event to have a bigger impact on attendees.
“It was very interesting, but also really personal,” said Emily Allen, a sophomore majoring in psychology and creative writing. “I really liked the personal aspect. Natalie brought it a step above something rigid like a class.”
Marrissa Emond, a senior majoring in biological sciences who helped organize the event, said she hoped all attendees were able to benefit from the event.
“It is important trans people have acknowledgement,” she said. “A lot of people acknowledge themselves more to be LGB allies, but they always forget the ‘T,’ the little ‘trans’ at the end.”
The time for talking is over!  It’s time for action USC.  There are only 45 days left before our planet suffers irreparable harm from global warming!  And what do we do?  We sit around a conference room talking about gender neutral bathrooms and how to be trans-friendly.  No one cares about gender neutral bathrooms when we are under 40 feet of pacific ocean water people!  Your trans-ally won’t last long when the global food supply runs out.  Do you realize how much carbon was emitted during the construction of those gender bending bathrooms?? Wake up GBLT copmmunity!  Wake up USC!!
What in the hell is a “Gender Neutral” restroom and why do we need them?  Do they have different plumbing or does everything flush like normal?  In this time of Obamanomics and Global Warming, why would USC waste any money on something so stupid as a Gender Neutral restroom?    If you people need a place to meet up, I am sure we can accomodate you in some conference room somewhere on Campus.  And yes that was fumble and we should have gotten the ball back…..
I started my own wall chart in my dorm room.  Does it make any difference that I don’t have any green markers?
OMG “ze, hir, and hirs” what’s next? Polygamists? UFO cults?
Yeah, but what about that bad call during the Stanford game?
