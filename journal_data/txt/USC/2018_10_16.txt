Daily Trojan file photo
The women’s tennis team had a strong showing this weekend at the Women of Troy Invitational, with a 12-6 record in singles and an 11-0 doubles performance. 
The team hosted Loyola Marymount, Oregon, Arizona and Cal State Fullerton at the tournament. 
On Friday, singles players included junior Becca Weissmann, junior Angela Kulikov, freshman Danielle Willson, freshman Estella Jaeger and junior Sydney Van Alphen. They faced competition from Cal State Fullerton, a program whose doubles team reached the Big West championship match for the first time in program history last season. 
All of them won their matches but Kulikov, who lost to senior Karla Portalatin in the longest match of the day (2-6, 6-3, 10-7). Weissmann had the most dominating first match, winning against sophomore Genevieve Zeidan, 6-0, 6-1. 
The USC women’s doubles teams won all of its matches on Friday. The pairings consisted of senior Rianna Valdes/Kulikov, sophomore Alexa Corcoleotes/Van Alphen, Weissmann/junior Constance Branstine and Weissmann/Jaeger. Each doubles match was settled after only one set. Weissman and Jaeger’s win against the team of senior Camila Wesbrooks and senior Taylor Tamblyn was the only match that finished 6-0 on Friday. Valdes and Kulikov played two matches on the day, beating pairs from the Oregon and Arizona.
Kulikov said her summer training helped in this tournament.
“Typically, I play the backhand side, but today we were trying some different partner combinations,” Kulikov said. “For my game I’m a bit of a net player, that’s really my strength, so this summer especially I put a lot of work developing my base line game for doubles.”
The Trojans did not have the same success on Saturday. The Trojans went .500 in singles, winning four of eight matches. Weissmann, Valdes, Willson and Branstine all won; Weissmann had the closest match, narrowly winning 7-6(2), 6-4. The singles players on the losing ends included Jaeger, Van Alphen and Kulikov. Van Alphen struggled on Saturday, losing two single matches against Tamblyn from Arizona and junior Julia Eshet from Oregon. 
The Trojans only played three doubles matches and won all three. The winning pairs included Weissmann/Willson, Kulikov/Jaeger and Van Alphen/Corcoleotoes. The teams from Loyola Marymount competed hard against the Women of Troy, as the team of junior Siobhan Anderson and sophomore Eva Marie Voracek lost 7-6(4) to Weissmann/Willson and the team of junior Camila Tumosa and sophomore Yesica De Lucas lost 6-4 against Kulikov/Jaeger.
“We were just trying to put as much pressure as we could on the opponents, and be really aggressive at the net and move our feet as much as we could, just to keep them on their toes,” Willson said.
On the final day of the tournament, the singles team showed resolve, going 4-1 overall. Kulikov suffered USC’s only singles loss of the day, playing in one of the closest games of the tournament, against Loyola Marymount’s Voracek (7-6(5), 6-4). The singles winners were Weissmann, Kulikov, Willson and Jaeger. 
“It was a well fought match, I thought I stuck to my game plan really well, executed, and it was fun to be out there competing alongside my teammates,” Weissmann said. 
As for the USC women’s doubles teams, Kulikov/Valdes, Weissmann/Willson and Jaeger/Branstine all had fantastic performances to give the Trojans a three-match win over Cal State Fullerton. 
The Women of Troy will compete in the ITA Southwest Regional Championships, which will be held in San Diego this Thursday.

Sophomore driver Jacob Mercep scored the game-winning goal against Stanford on Sunday. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
USC had an impressive showing over the weekend as the No. 3 men’s water polo team avenged its only loss of the season against Stanford with a dramatic 10-9 victory in the Mountain Pacific Invitational tournament championship game Sunday. The Trojans had a victory-filled weekend with wins over Air Force, Long Beach State and Cal, paving the way to the championship game. 
The Trojans netted a last-second goal to seal the win. USC started off hot when freshman goalie Nic Porter rejected an attempted Stanford five-meter penalty shot. The USC offense notched back-to-back goals by drivers freshman Hannes Daube and senior Zack D’sa. Stanford responded to level the score at 2-2 but USC turned it back on when redshirt junior driver Daniel Leong lasered in a shot to give the Trojans a 3-2 lead at the end of the first quarter. 
Leong’s goal started a 4-goal attack from USC with scores from Daube, sophomore driver Marko Vavic and junior driver Marin Dasic. USC led by 4 goals in the third quarter but Stanford slowly narrowed in on the Trojans, evening the score in the final minute of play. Sophomore driver Jacob Mercep notched a game-winning goal with five seconds left in the game, clinching the Mountain Pacific Invitational tournament title for the Trojans. 
USC started the tournament with a decisive victory over Air Force on Friday in a 20-6 win. USC notched the first 3 goals of the game and had a 6-2 lead at the half. Junior captain two-meter man Matt Maier and sophomore driver Sawyer Rhodes both had recorded hat tricks in the opening game and eight USC players contributed points in the win over the Falcons. Freshman goalie Sam Krutonog manned the cage for three periods before sophomore Vaios Vlahotasios took over for a fourth quarter shutout. 
The Trojans stayed strong Saturday with takedowns of No. 9 Long Beach State in a 14-8 game and No. 4 Cal in a 13-6 semifinal match. USC brought the energy to the morning face-off against Long Beach State, recording the first 4 goals of the game. Long Beach State was able to net 2 goals before the end of the half to trail the Trojans 8-2. Daube completed his hat trick early in the third period and Vavic scored on USC’s second five-meter penalty shot of the game as USC continued on at a steady pace with goals from Mercep and D’sa. Sophomore driver Christian Hockenbury and Leong both netted goals of their own in the fourth quarter to secure USC’s 14-8 victory.
On Saturday afternoon, the Trojans faced Cal for the first time this season in the semifinal game. The game stayed close in the first period, with neither USC nor Cal finding a lead.  Cal answered back to scores from Vavic and redshirt sophomore utility Luka Karaman’s goals with scores of their own, but Rhodes put USC back in the lead with a powerful bar-in goal to give the Trojans a 3-2 advantage. Porter led the defense with 13 saves, including one attempted five-meter penalty shot that would have narrowed USC’s lead to only one point. The Trojans’ advantage quickly widened to an 11-5 lead, scoring the first 4 goals of the second half. USC surrendered only one more goal before capturing a 13-6 win over the Golden Bears and earning its spot in the final. 
The Trojans return to Southern California for two non-conference games this weekend. The Trojans face off at 1 p.m. on Saturday at Long Beach State, before hosting Pepperdine at 1 p.m. on Sunday at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

In pretty much every respect, Saturday night was a major victory for USC football. In a season tarnished by turmoil, berated by bad breaks and filled with calls for the heads of nearly everyone in the front office, a win at home over a ranked, previously undefeated Colorado squad could prove to be a major turning point in the team’s 2018 fortunes.
With that said, USC was still left with a deep, lasting scar from the Pac-12 battle in the Coliseum when defensive captain senior linebacker Porter Gustin was forced out of the game in its closing moments. Gustin fractured his ankle and saw his injury-plagued USC career end in a flash, in a situation the team shouldn’t have been in. 
After playing in just four games in 2017, Gustin had managed to put together easily the most complete season of his career. With seven sacks on the year, including 1.5 in the Colorado game alone, the captain was tied for sixth in the nation in that statistic.
A truly gifted pass rusher, Gustin leaves his playing days as a Trojan as one of the best linebackers over the past decade at USC. With 21 sacks over his injury-limited career, Porter will prepare for the 2019 NFL Draft. Considering his status as a top-10 prospect at his position, he is expected to go within the first few rounds of the draft.
An outpouring of love for the senior linebacker has come from former Trojans Kenny Bigelow Jr. and Antwaun Woods, yet the team will need more than well wishes to fill the void left in Gustin’s absence.
Veterans such as juniors defensive lineman Connor Murphy and linebacker Oluwole Betiku Jr. will have to find a way to produce and take advantage of the additional snaps that will come their way. 
However, no one will have as much pressure to step up to the task as junior defensive end Christian Rector. With Gustin injured and on the sideline for much of the 2017 season, Rector flourished as a pass rusher and racked up 7.5 sacks to help put USC atop the nation in the statistic. Through the first six games in 2018, Rector has been relatively silent, picking up one tackle for loss and failing to bring down the quarterback once. While he no longer has the advantage of lining up across from former Trojans Uchenna Nwosu and Rasheem Green, the Loyola product will need to return to last season’s form if USC’s defense is to remain dominant and capable.
For as much as the absence of a top-10 pass rusher will cost USC in terms of production, it may lose even more in terms of leadership and team chemistry. Last year, USC was able to survive Gustin’s absence due to the experience of players such as Green, Nwosu and Chris Hawkins. This year, however, the squad isn’t afforded such a luxury and will now turn to its seniors in cornerbacks Iman Marshall, Ajene Harris, linebacker Cameron Smith and safety Marvell Tell III to help fill in what is lost by Gustin’s injury.
In many ways, these four players represent a major generational gap on the USC team. Along with veterans such as Toa Lobendahn and Chris Brown, these are essentially the only remaining players that had an impact role on the 2016 team that won the Rose Bowl. With impact players like Adoree’ Jackson, Sam Darnold and JuJu Smith-Schuster long gone, it is up to the lasting veterans to lead by example the way those before them did.
Even before Gustin’s injury, USC was facing an uphill battle in the division, if not the conference. Even after taking the Pac-12 South lead with the win over Colorado, USC will need to find a way to win in Salt Lake City against the Utes, a feat that hasn’t been accomplished since Marqise Lee put up nearly 200 yards on the Utes in 2012.
Now, with Gustin permanently on the sideline, USC’s veteran leadership will be asked to step up and deliver for the Trojans one final time. The fate of the South, the Pac-12 and the future of USC football just might be at stake.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
My roommate just came off a two-month-long break from Instagram, something a social media junkie like myself would gawk at. She broke her cleanse, downloaded the app and scrolled through photos for 10 minutes before the negative mental effects of social media began to weigh on her again. Without a second thought, she immediately deleted the app again, put down her phone and returned to life in the real world.
Since summer, my roommate has made the bold decision to delete nearly all the social media apps off her phone, caving every once in a while only to find that she hadn’t been missing out on much. She is not alone in these revelations. In fact, she’s a part of the growing 64 percent of Gen-Z members who are taking a break from social media. Further, a survey of over 1,000 people from 18-to-24-years old revealed 41 percent of young people think platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat make them feel anxious, sad or depressed according to a survey conducted by the research arm of Hill Holiday, Origin. Consequently, more and more young people are actively choosing to detach from social media, arguably a crucial part of living in the modern age. Still, 77 percent say having a social media presence is more beneficial than it is harmful, so why is there such a disconnect between users’ actions and mental states?
Instagram is easily one of the most dominant platforms among Gen-Z and millennials, but it is also the most toxic. Long gone are the days of taking middle school selfies, applying in-app filters and posting photos without a care about engagement or having a “nice feed.” In 2018, whether (or not) you’re an obsessive user, posts are clearly more curated with carefully thought-out captions, filters, angles, expressions and countless other considerations. As a result, such curation has allowed individuals to build entire platforms and careers on Instagram. The real toxicity of the platform isn’t in the resulting comparison between individuals; instead, the toxic nature of Instagram comes from the level of curation itself. No one is that happy all the time. No one is that perfect all the time. When that’s all you see, however, it becomes increasingly harder to believe.
On a more personal note, here’s a quick inside look into my Instagram process. First, I’ll make a point of going to a destination with a friend to take photos. After filtering through the hundreds of photos, I’ll narrow it down to 10 or 15. I edit those select images in the photos app before applying a filter in the app VSCO (C7 all the way). Next, I’ll narrow that down to four photos I like, which I import into the organization app UNUM to see which one fits my feed. Lastly, I’ll send the photos to my roommate to see which one is her favorite, come up with a caption and then finally upload to Instagram. This whole process takes upward of an hour — maybe even two hours. Needless to say, whenever I ask my roommate which photo I should post, she rolls her eyes.
I detail this process not to emphasize my narcissism, but to highlight the ridiculous measures we go to for likes, comments and the sake of a personal online “brand.” We have to step back and ask ourselves the fundamental question: Why do we do this?
If this column hasn’t made it clear enough, I see social media as a critical resource for discovery and opportunity. Between my professional and personal social media ventures, I spend an inordinate amount of time contemplating how to craft content online that will impact life offline in some manner. Constantly putting on this show, however, is not just mentally taxing — it’s unnatural. At no point in human history has nearly 30 percent of the world’s population put themselves on a public platform accessible by almost anyone anywhere. Face it: We can barely manage our own lives, let alone keep up with hundreds of others’. Information overload takes over when we are constantly presenting ourselves while comparing our lives to others’. The worst part is it’s become so second-nature that we often don’t even realize we’re doing it.
When I was interviewing candidates for Reach, USC’s social media club, one of my favorite questions to was: “Where do you think social media is headed?” In the past decade, we’ve allowed ourselves to become consumed by social media, but with more and more people quitting various platforms, it is clear that the way social media currently functions is not sustainable. Even though my social media presence sounds obsessive, I, too, have scaled back significantly and have chosen to post only what makes me happy and confident for the sake of my own mental well-being.
At the end of the day, it’s about balance. Our interwoven existence with the online world isn’t going anywhere, so quitting social media entirely and too wrapped up in it are equally futile. Ultimately, a digitally present individual should allow social media to organically reflect real life, not wage a constant battle between their real and digitized selves. My extensive Instagram process probably isn’t changing anytime soon, but my ability to live a healthier life both online and offline is.

Held at the scenic Lake Perris State Recreation Area in Moreno Valley, this year’s Desert Daze festival that took place Friday to Sunday was surrounded by jagged mountains and stunning views. Previously housed in Palm Springs, Joshua Tree and Mecca, the seventh installment of the alt-rock music festival featured headliners Tame Impala and My Bloody Valentine. 
All preconceived notions about the festival layout faded away as patrons entered. Glowing psychedelic, interactive art installations were scattered across Moreno Beach, creeping down to the waterline. By the beach, the music faded away, and the glow of suburbia at the far end of the reservoir felt as if one was at edge of the world. This is one of the overarching motifs that defined the Desert Daze experience; the atmosphere, art, lack of cellular service and genre of music all catered to the festival’s bizarre, otherworldly theme. It was less overrun by mass amounts of people, creating a genuine, intimate space that felt almost untouched by the mainstream nature of most events of its kind. 
Eventually, a large group made its way to the main stage, dubbed “The Moon,” to catch Warpaint’s set. From beautifully synced harmonization to sleepy rhythms, the indie rock trio delivered an incredible set to the lucky crowd who had made it through the festival’s chaotic parking traffic. 
At another stage named “The Theater,” patrons gathered to catch British punk band IDLES. Ironically, this indoor stage contained retro, vaporwave decor, spanning from vintage TVs to Greco-Roman statues that completely contrasted the gritty punk rock music on stage. IDLES’ intense energy set up The Theater for an hour of moshing, replete  with a speedo-wearing guitarist and ample time for the crowd to expel their angst before Tame Impala’s headlining set. 
After IDLES’ performance, the wind escalated significantly and bursts of lightning bolts frequently decorated the sky behind the mountains surrounding Lake Perris. As patrons excitedly waited for Tame Impala’s set, the crowd’s energy was electric as people cheered each time lightning struck behind the looming mountains. 
Despite the rain, the crowd roared as Tame Impala’s signature visuals appeared on the massive stage screens. Although Tame Impala’s live performance didn’t match the same dreamy quality the band usually exudes in its studio music, the amplified drums fit the festival’s rock methodology. After a strong start, fit with confetti cannons and psychedelic visuals, Tame Impala’s set was unfortunately cut short due to an approaching thunderstorm.
This poor weather ended the first day of an immersive, unique and otherworldly experience early. Even as patrons left the festival that night, there was still a line of cars at the entrance filled with people waiting to make it into the festival. However, what Desert Daze lacked in organization it certainly made up in entertainment, complete with world-class performers and captivating art.

Directed by Nathan Singh, “When You Comin’ Back, Red Ryder?” is playing at the Scene Dock Theatre until Oct. 21. (Photo from Facebook)
On Friday, “When You Comin’ Back, Red Ryder?” debuted at the Scene Dock Theatre as part of the School of Dramatic Arts’ BFA Senior Acting Repertory. The play — performed entirely by SDA seniors — is about a quaint diner, its neighborly inhabitants, a couple of tourists and the unstable war veteran who takes them hostage. Despite minor flaws, the production was stunning. 
The play’s most obvious strength is its set decoration. The detail that went into the visual design is immediately captivating, from the glowing jukebox in the corner to the real, edible food prepared live by Antoinette Ricchio in character as diner waitress Angel. Another noteworthy element of the set design is that the other BFA Senior Acting Repertory production, “Bus Stop,” which plays in tandem with “When You Comin’ Back, Red Ryder?” shares the set. Between shows, stagehands preserve most of the set since both productions take place in a diner. 
The sound design was also impressive, from the low notes of cowboy country tones upon entering the theater, to the brash punk rock music following a violent break and intermission. Sound designer Dominic Torquato deserves recognition for conveying the correct tone of the play and its clash of emotions. 
The cast also brought the heat with great character work. Some had much more dialogue than others, but all factions capitalized on their stagetime. 
Despite the titular character being Stephen “Red” Ryder (Jackson Jones), Teddy (Ian Stewart Riley) was the story’s protagonist, perhaps because his character ignites the play’s hostage-scene climax. Jones’ performance as Red provided key tension and emotion in many scenes, but Riley dominated the dialogue and was more expressive than anyone else on stage — convincingly conveying the threatening and emotionally tortured persona his role required. Richard and Clarisse Etheridge, portrayed by Matthew Aberly Lebowitz and Lisandra Stebner, had the play’s most heart-wrenching exchange about faith and trust after being pushed to the limits by their situation.
Another point of contention and one to consider if one is more sensitive to language is that the play is a little dated, and so the dialogue is as well.
Director Nathan Singh said he was more than happy to put on the play, as he found it very topical considering the current political ecosystem and the nation’s divisiveness. With a powerful couple like the Etheridges pitted against Ryder and Angel’s minuteness, he’s not wrong. He was also quick to mention the psychological realism and how it plays on human behavior, which is very apparent in the stony silences and emotional tension on stage. 
SDA’s production of “When You Comin’ Back, Red Ryder?” is playing at Scene Dock Theatre Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m.

Within the past two months, four USC fraternities have faced or currently face suspension due to charges of hazing. Although it is well-known among students that hazing is alive and well on USC’s campus, what’s seldom considered is the psychological motivations behind the practice — a critical step in taking measures to offer alternatives to dangerous hazing practices in the future. 
USC’s policy guidelines and California law explicitly forbid hazing, with SCampus defining it as “any method of initiation or preinitiation into a student organization … which is likely to cause serious bodily injury to any former, current or prospective student.” 
David Burkman, director of the independent film “HAZE” explains in a USA Today article that the psychology of hazing is rooted in humans’ primal need to become a part of a community and that all people share this psychological drive. 
But Burkman said becoming an accepted part of a group doesn’t fully satisfy this evolutionary urge.
“We need hazing to make it feel like we are achieving something real (even if it isn’t),” Burkman wrote. “We have to feel that we earned it, that we went through a trial. It’s in every story: The hero must face trials and tribulations to grow in strength and knowledge to become all that he or she can be. It has to be hard.”
However, this explanation does not adequately address how the humiliation and scare tactics associated with hazing is conducive to building “brotherhood.” 
In fact, many researchers, including psychologist and hazing expert Susan Lipkins, assert that hazing is about something psychologically darker and less obvious than community building. 
“This century has seen a rise in deaths and sodomy due to hazing rituals,” Lipkins wrote on her website Inside Hazing, which aims to raise awareness on the widespread practice. “In general, hazing has become more violent, more humiliating, and more sexual. Hazardous hazing is a virus that has attacked our youth and is spreading quickly.”
Former fraternity brother Gabriel Maestretti, who was charged for the hazing-related death of Matthew Carrington at Chico State University in 2005, confirmed that his motivations for hazing were more sinister than many are led to believe. At his sentencing, Maestretti took ownership for his actions and told the jury, “Hazing isn’t funny, it’s not cute. It’s stupid, dangerous. It’s not about brotherhood, it’s about power and control.”
In light of the recent interim suspensions of fraternities at USC, the administration is trying to figure out how to prevent dangerous hazing-related accidents from happening on campus. Suspending fraternities isn’t the answer, because uncertified Greek groups do not have to answer to anti-hazing regulations.
Moreover, Greek organizations on campus have made it clear that regulations won’t deter them, as evidenced by recent hazing suspensions.
For Maestretti, it took a felony on his record and a year in jail to finally realize the dark reality of hazing. 
Hopefully, the same measures will not be necessary for USC’s students to wise up.
The University made the right decision in placing Sigma Alpha Mu and Phi Sigma Kappa on interim suspension, but students and the administration alike must find alternative, beneficial ways to build the culture of “brotherhood” that’s used  to justify hazing.
After all, other student organizations on campus maintain beneficial initiation practices. For many organizations, a simple application that proves one’s skill and character is enough for communal acceptance. For many clubs, a shared interest is all it takes to create bonds. 
StopHazing, an anti-hazing awareness group comprising teachers and researchers alike, lists multiple healthy alternatives to dangerous hazing practices, including participating in community service projects together, planning athletic or social events with other organizations or developing a peer mentor system. 
It is entirely possible for Greek organizations to adopt the same approach, but they first must find the courage to shirk dangerous, arbitrary traditions in favor of building positive institutions for the future.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Screams rained down from the gallery onto the Senate floor last Saturday as Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault by multiple women, was confirmed to the Supreme Court. The raw terror and misery of the protesters conveyed a fresh sense of how morally broken our government is two years into the Trump administration. I wonder how the hell things got this bad.
The Kavanaugh hearings and subsequent confirmation seemed to be a referendum on the way the United States treats cases of sexual assault. On one side is the rhetoric of “believe survivors” and on the other is “innocent until proven guilty.” To varying degrees, both of these approaches are flawed, and those flaws teach Americans not only to reflexively jump to conclusions, but also to never ignore and condescend those who come forward.
“Believe survivors” is, to me, the more respectable of the two polar ends of the discussion. Christine Blasey Ford was a credible witness whose strong testimony compelled me, and millions of other Americans, to call for a full investigation to evaluate the truth of her claims. I believe her testimony, but her word alone isn’t enough to convict Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Ford understood that, which is why she repeatedly welcomed an independent FBI investigation. “Believe survivors,” shouldn’t mean accepting their side because they’ve made an accusation; it should mean finding their word credible enough to seriously listen and investigate.  
With that said, I am troubled by the calls for Price School of Public Policy professor James Moore to be fired because of his poorly timed email to the Price school, in which he said “accusers sometimes lie.” His statement isn’t incorrect. Of the extreme minority of rapes that do go reported, 5.2 percent are found to be false according to a meta-analysis conducted at the Queensland University of Technology. While that’s an extremely low proportion, it isn’t negligible; thus, an accusation shouldn’t be treated as proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
That’s what an investigation is for: to discover the truth.     
Conversely, the FBI found that only 8 percent of rape accusations are determined to be false after investigation. For GOP senators to understand that statistic, and to not call for an investigation with the full capacities of the FBI is, as Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut claimed, “tantamount to a cover-up.” 
On the opposite side of the argument is the “innocent until proven guilty” approach. This argument is based on an integral value of equitable criminal justice, where presumption of innocence is the norm, but it has been grossly misapplied and misrepresented by those using it to defend Kavanaugh. 
The key word is “until,” which implies some sort of process. In a court of law, the process implied would be an investigation. We say “innocent until proven guilty” because it implies an effort to discover evidence of guilt, or lack thereof. For that to happen, there must be at least an exploration of the issue. This has not happened to a sufficient extent during the Kavanaugh confirmation.  
Republicans have tried to have it both ways. By calling upon principles of equitable, criminal justice, such as “innocent until proven guilty,” they equated the Kavanaugh hearing to a criminal trial, yet failed to execute the due process a criminal trial demands. A key aspect of criminal trials is the presentation of evidence found from investigations which take time to complete. The investigation the Senate begrudgingly permitted under extreme political pressure was so limited in its scope and time frame that it would be considered inadequate for any credible sexual assault allegation, much less one to determine the moral soundness of a Supreme Court nominee. 
Agents weren’t allowed to issue subpoenas or issue orders for physical evidence and they were limited in who they were allowed to interview. The FBI interviewed only 10 witnesses total, and only six involved in the Ford’s allegations, ignoring requests by Democrats to interview over a dozen other witnesses. Since this investigation was outside the regular practice for the FBI and initiated by the White House, the Trump administration was able to set the parameters. Considering that Trump lied about the restrictions he put on the FBI, saying he gave them “free rein” when he in fact applied strict limitations, I find no credibility in this toothless investigation. Consequently, I find no reason to believe this accusation was actually treated within the context of “innocent until proven guilty,” because no effort was ever made to “prove guilty.”
Kavanaugh might have been qualified to serve on the court if these allegations were investigated, but neither he nor his right-wing political allies wished to search for truth, because they either don’t trust women or don’t care about sexual assault. Kavanaugh will hold his seat on the bench for decades, and during that time he may hinder the progress of women’s rights, and will principally serve as a symbol of this country’s disregard for women, survivors and the truth.
It’s time for a new country. Election day is Nov. 6. Vote.

Postdoctoral fellow Zhiyao Lu said the most reliable drive for economicgrowth is technology. Lu believes ground-shaking technology can stem from traditional research. (Photo from USC News)
Postdoctoral student Zhiyao Lu leads Catapower, a startup that designed a molecular robot to turn vegetable oil into renewable fuels and biodegradable plastic. 
This year, Lu earned the top 2018 Wrigley Sustainability Prize in an annual competition that promotes eco-friendly business concepts. From that, Catapower was selected for the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps program, which aims to foster national innovation beyond the laboratory. The I-Corps program has provided Lu’s team with training on technology commercialization, as well as providing research and development funds. 
“Our idea at the time was to turn this waste into a biodegradable plastic to replace the plastic currently in the market,” Lu said. 
As chemists, Lu’s team wanted to tackle the rise of greenhouse gases and the filling of plastic waste in the ocean. The team began to research biofuels and realized that the largest issue was the excessive waste generated during manufacturing.
To combat the issue, they considered biodegradable plastic, which decomposes naturally in the environment through living organisms such as bacteria. Lu’s team wanted to make an impact in the society, and to do so, they decided to commercialize the new technology in July 2017. 
“When I first started the research, I purely looked at it as an academic research problem,” Lu said. “Then, I realized there is great market potential and I wanted to know what people think of the technology, what customers really need.”
Lu said that commercialization has been a complex process. He said that it has become difficult to get companies to accommodate the new technology.
“To effect change in this industry, we have to be able to convince people to think differently,” Lu said. 
Catapower plans to expand its business by helping manufacturers implement their technology on a larger scale, recruiting more customers and helping non-biofuel industries such as the wax and cosmetic industries, which deal with products from vegetable oil. 
“If people don’t think we can make the ground-shaking technology in the traditional research areas, then they’re wrong,” Lu said. “I think the future direction for the company is not only to scale up the technology we have now  but also to advance more clean technologies to make the world a better place, to preserve the environment and to improve the quality of life.”

Students who display valuables such as cell phones and wallets while they’re distracted are likely to be targeted, according to DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle. (Daily Trojan file photo)
USC students received a Department of Public Safety notification Monday detailing two related robberies on the 1200 W. 37th Drive block Sunday morning. 
According to the alert, a student was approached at a party by a suspect who demanded his cell phone. When the student “raised his hands, backed up and indicated he did not want trouble,” two other suspects grabbed his wallet.
Another incident occurred that night during which a suspect, who introduced himself as “Breezie,” befriended a student. Later that evening, he stole the student’s cell phone after asking if the student had an Instagram account, according to the DPS notice. 
Immediately after, the student alerted two men standing near him who then stole the student’s wallet and keys. The two men were identified as suspects two and three in the report.
DPS has yet to locate the suspects and is working with LAPD to solve the cases. 
DPS is labeling the incidents as related due to their proximity and the similar behavioral and physical descriptions of the suspects, according to assistant chief David Carlisle.
“Typically when a student’s phone is taken, they are walking and they are not paying attention to their surroundings, and it is jerked from their hand,” Carlisle said. “So this is unusual in that the [suspect] initiated a conversation.”
DPS hopes that students remain aware of their surroundings when they are walking on streets and at social events. 
“Students need to trust their intuition,” Carlisle said. “In most cases, students will have some indication that nothing is ‘quite right,’ and in those cases, it is best to be with a group of friends … and [not to] put yourself in a position to be taken advantage of.”
In the email notice, DPS advised students to be wary of strangers, refrain from using cell phones while walking and avoid distractions. DPS also warned students not to resist in the case of a robbery and to call DPS and LAPD immediately after going to a safe location. 
Carlisle said that when students display their valuables, such as cell phones and wallets, they are likely to be targeted, especially if they are distracted. 
“The faster DPS is notified, the better our chances are of locating the suspects,” Carlisle said. “We all have to be aware that these kinds of things can happen anywhere.”

Dentistry students Eumi Choi and Thomas Nguyen plan to serve in the public dental industry. Nguyen wants to run a clinic in a small town and Choi hopes to work with the L.A. community and at USC. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Dentistry students Thomas Nguyen and Eumi Choi received scholarships from the National Health Service Corps last week. The NHSC program ensures full tuition and a monthly stipend of $1,300 for medical students. In return, the scholars must provide clinical health services and treatment to areas with a shortage of medical professionals. 
Nguyen, a second-year dentistry student, said that his devotion to bettering the public care industry stems from his low-income roots. Nguyen said his family had to rely on Medi-Cal and food grants while he was growing up, and didn’t have access to proper hygienic care. 
To prevent others from going through his childhood experiences, Nguyen pursued a profession that would help those with underprivileged backgrounds. He earned a bachelor’s degree in kinesiology from Cal State Long Beach and attended podiatry school until he realized he was most passionate for dentistry after gaining experience in the field. 
“Everything about dentistry really just appealed to me, the procedures seemed really interesting and I got to work with my hands,” Nguyen said.
Unlike Nguyen, Choi, a dental hygiene graduate, spent much of her childhood going on mission trips with her parents to volunteer in disadvantaged areas. Choi said she remembers a specific trip to Nicaragua that pushed her to pursue a career in public dentistry. 
“I was just there volunteering, assisting, doing administrative work and logistics and when I was there I spent a lot of time at the dental clinic translating for the dentist,” Choi said. “I think from there, I decided I wanted to do dentistry … They were amazing people and they really inspired me and so I wanted to have more of a practical skill set.”
Choi also attributes her success to the work she has done at public dentistry offices like the USC Mobile Clinic, a program where dental students travel in mobile offices to areas with a shortage of medical professionals. The program gave Choi the opportunity to receive hands-on medical care experience and become engaged with community outreach.
“Sometimes we’ll travel to Bakersfield or Escondido, look for migrant farmers and provide free care for their children and parents,” Choi said. “We visit these sites every year, very regularly, and it’s amazing because we can do it. We can follow up on the patients that we see every year.”  
Ostrow Dean Avishai Sadan believes NHSC scholars are important and that students should give back to the community through public service. 
“We’re really proud of [Choi] and [Nguyen] on their National Health Service Corps scholarships,” Sadan said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “The education that they will receive here at Ostrow — with our focus on giving back to the community — will prepare them for the all-too-important work they’ll be doing in underserved communities after dental school.”
The two aspiring dentists plan to serve in the public dental industry in the near future. Nguyen wants to run a public clinic in a small town where he can connect with the patients, and Choi hopes to continue helping the greater L.A. community by working at USC after graduation.
