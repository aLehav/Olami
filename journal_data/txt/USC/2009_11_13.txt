“Please stand for something,” said Deyonte Austin as he stood on stage at Lazzaro Plaza, his arms and legs in shackles.
Austin, a junior majoring in music industry, was playing the role of a slave in the Black Student Assembly’s re-enactment of a slave auction on Thursday. The event was held in honor of Nakumbuka Day — dedicated to Africans who died on the Middle Passage — a route of the slave trade. About 1 to 2 million slaves died on the Middle Passage.

As he recited his speech on stage, Austin began to cry. He  said after ward that re-enacting the role of a slave deeply moved him.
“For a second, I felt like I was actually in that position,” he said. “My grandfather used to tell me stories like this. He saw it … I could never forget.”
“Nakumbuka” translates to “I remember” in Swahili. The slave auction re-enactment was held to ensure people did remember — or, for those who had never heard of the day, to teach about the plight of slaves traveling from Africa.
The re-enactment drew in many passersby as Chris McAbery, a Caucasian male, led three black students — Austin, Rachel Brown and Brandi Vicks — from Tommy Trojan to Lazzaro Plaza.
Austin, Brown and Vicks, playing the role of slaves, wore shackles around their necks and were tied together in a line. They wore dirty, ripped clothes and hung their heads as they walked.
McAbery led the three slaves onto a stage. He displayed them each individually, and then each spoke — Austin recited a poem about slavery, Vicks detailed the horrors of the Middle Passage and Brown spoke as if she were a slave who was making the journey.
About 30 people were gathered at Lazzaro Plaza when the re-enactment began; many more stopped to see what was happening and stayed to hear the speeches.
“It was definitely eye-catching,” said Gabe Suranyi, a senior majoring in business administration, who had never heard of Nakumbuka Day before. “It was a good idea.”
Eye-catching is precisely what the BSA was aiming for. Though it has held memorials for Nakumbuka Day in past years, Tirsa St. Fort, executive director of BSA said the group had hoped to stage an event that would draw people in.
“We were going for people who might not have heard of it,” she said. “The speakers were intense — it caught attention. It was a lot different.”
The event was intense for those who participated, as well.
“I got a couple of dirty looks,” said McAbery, a junior majoring in economics. “But I remembered it’s for a good cause.”
Slavery is mark upon this nation like nothing else.  However, global warming is going to kill us all if we don’t stop all these toxic emissions now!
I love college
We are the world….
America’s dark and evil slave trade past must be showcased so that it is never forgotten.  But I think efforts need to be focused on what is really important.  GLOBAL WARMING!  Did you know we have just 54 days left to SAVE OUR PLANET.  We need Cap and Trade now.  If you want to stand for something.  Stand for a carbon neutral future.  Stand for shutting down the capitalism that is killing our Mother – the earth.  The USC Greek system, made up of the spoiled kids of rich white capitalist America — the ones who owned slaves, emits the most carbon of any group at USC.  They have parties all night and leave the lights on 24 hours a day.  they also use air conditioning and leave their front doors wide open – air conditioning the street I guess?  I want to be the first concerned student at USC to stand up and demand that we – SHUT THE GREEK SYSTEM DOWN NOW.  Slavery is important but not as important as global warming.  Wake up USC!  Wake up America.
Thanks, I needed a laugh!
We also need to pass OBAMACARE and let’s not forget about THE MONEY WE COULD BE SAVING WITH GEICO!
Hey, hold on a second…the lights are off between the hours of 7am and 1pm when they sleep off the previous nights party.  Come on, get a clue.  Without the money coming in from the parents of these folks USC wouldn’t be the powerhouse university that it is today.  You’re funny, thanks.
Slavery consist of not being able to get a education, comprehend information intelligently and apply it to getting a real job.

Hoping to increase its fundraising revenue any way it can, Troy Camp is expanding its annual Pass the Can fundraiser to give students an easier way to donate — via text message.
“We are trying to solicit donations from people who don’t have change,” said Collin Evans, a senior majoring in international relations and the director of alumni and public relations for Troy Camp. “A lot of people show up with a credit card or no cash, and this is a way to get those people.”

Each year at the Homecoming football game, Troy Camp — a student group that works with local elementary school children — passes empty milk cartons around the rows of the Coliseum, hoping for donations to help fund their annual summer trip for local elementary students.
In the past, though, those milk cartons never made it to the student section because there were not enough volunteers to staff the entire stadium. But Troy Camp has hit a financial rough patch and will target students with the new text message donation system.
“Before, we didn’t have enough students volunteers to go to the student section, so the text messages will allow those students to participate,” said Ben Rose, a junior majoring in international relations and the director of fundraising for Troy Camp’s Pass the Can.
During the game, students can text the word “camp” to 85944. A $5 charge will then be added to the student’s cell phone bill. Troy Camp makes $4.50 for every text message, and the other 50 cents goes to Mobilecause, the company providing the service.
Troy Camp will advertise the text message system on the Coliseum’s big screen, and the group is hoping to get USC’s Spirit Leaders to hold up signs telling students how to donate. The goal is to raise $2,000 through text donations.
Last year, the group raised almost $33,000 through Pass the Can, but since it costs the group about $150,000 per year to put on its annual camp, Troy Camp is looking to raise more money any way it can.
Troy Camp is faced with the task of raising the whole $150,000 this year — it have no surplus from last year’s camp. It is an improvement over last year, though, when it began the year in debt.
“Financially last year we came in with some debt, but toward the end of the year we over-fundraised, so this year we started at zero with no debt and no surplus,” said Xavier Vargas, a junior majoring in history and the co-executive director of Troy Camp.
With the launch of the text message donation system, some have raised concerns about the poor cell phone service at the Coliseum.
“Unfortunately there is not much we can do,” Rose said. “We had a bunch of our members text back and forth last game and they had no problems. I know it is notoriously bad, so I am hoping it works.”
Still, Troy Camp has high hopes for the program and some students have already said they will likely donate.
“I think that’s a great way to get more people to donate. I know I never bring cash to the games, so if I can just text, I will definitely donate,” said Tammy Batzofin, a junior majoring in health and humanity.
Javier Sotelo, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, said he has never known how to donate before and is more likely to do so now.
“I haven’t participated in Pass the Can because I did not know the details of it,” he said. “Maybe if they passed the cans around the student section I would, but it hasn’t been that accessible. Texting would be easier.”
Troy Camp leaders said that if many students donate, they will consider extending Pass the Can to the student section in the future.
Even students who aren’t at Saturday’s football game will be able to donate — the system is open now and will remain open until Troy Camp’s contract with Mobilecause expires in February. This, Troy Camp leaders said, should help them raise more money.
The reason for not soliciting the student section for donations wasn’t just the lack of volunteers; it was mostly that trusting drunk college students with milk jugs full of cash didn’t seem like a good idea. The texts are a great way to get around both problems.

Saturday’s game against Stanford will bring thousands of alumni back to campus, but for local businesses, Homecoming Weekend’s influx of fans brings more than just Trojan spirit.
With the Alumni Association estimating that about 100,000 visitors will flock to campus — on Saturday, outlets on and around campus like the USC Pertusati Bookstore and the Radisson — expect to see an uptick in business over the weekend.
Coming home · Vendors around campus are preparing for  homecoming weekend, which will bring thousands of visitors to campus. - Vicki Yang | Daily Trojan
“With all the Trojan
faithful coming back, there’s always a huge surge of people,” said Daniel Archer, director of the USC Pertusati Bookstore. “There are normally a lot of people [on game day], but this is really extravagant.”
The bookstore takes several measures to ensure it can keep up with the throngs of people who flood the store.
“There’s a large amount of temporary labor to support the large crowds,” Archer said. “The stock area and sizing need to be correct, and the concessions booth near Tommy Trojan gets expanded to sell more products.”
The bookstore’s normal operating hours on weekends are from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., but during Homecoming it opens an hour earlier and closes an hour later to give customers as much time as possible to pick up merchandise.
During peak hours on Homecoming before the game, the store usually sells about $1,000 of merchandise per minute — Archer said he once saw sales up to $1,400 a minute — and he expects this weekend’s sales to be in the same range.
Still, the early timing — Saturday’s game is set to kick off at 12:30 p.m. — is going to affect the bookstore’s revenues.
“If we had, say, a five o’clock game, we’d definitely have more sales,” Archer said. “After the game is over, business slows down to a trickle.”
Erin Grathwohl, a freshman majoring in civil engineering (building science), has been putting money aside specifically for the purpose of purchasing bookstore merchandise over this weekend.
“I’m really excited about my first Homecoming,” Grathwohl said. “So I’m definitely planning on doing some shopping at the bookstore this weekend.”
On-campus dining, however, does not see as much of a jump in business as the bookstore, especially since most people prefer to tailgate on game days.
“Most groups and organizations bring their own food,” said Kristian Klinger, director of USC Hospitality. “There’s a small lift in business, but it’s nothing too dramatic.”
Klinger expects the real jump in profits comes with off-campus dining, since The Lab, McKay’s and Rosso Oro’s all usually see noticeable increases in business during game days.
This is the first year the three off-campus restaurants will be open during Homecoming Weekend, and Klinger said he expects them to serve as a hub for people to watch the game if they aren’t going to the Coliseum.
Michael Ramires, an undeclared freshman, said his parents are coming to watch the game and plan on eating somewhere off campus afterward.
“We’ll probably end up eating at either McKay’s or Rosso’s,” Ramires said. “We just want a convenient place to go eat after the game.”
Next door to the restaurants, the Radisson hotel is also set to benefit from the influx of alumni over the weekend.
Ashley Reid, the sales manager at the Radisson, said although business isn’t as good during Homecoming as it is during graduation or Parents’ Weekend, the hotel stills see a remarkable turnout.
“With the game going on, it always gets really busy,” Reid said. “The restaurants are always packed, and the hotel usually gets within 90 percent full to capacity.”
Reid said last-minute reservations called in during over the weekend can often make business even more hectic than usual.
“It’s usually people coming back from the game who don’t want to drive back home,” Reid said. “But there are also lots of
last-minute reservations for the different departments on campus, for the coaches and such.”
Reid said the game also attracts a large amount of people, which requires preparation to handle the visitors.
“You need to make sure you have enough staff,” she said. “There are lots of people, and the demand is high, so you have to be sure you can meet it.”
Archer echoed Reed’s statement, saying Homecoming Week was a prime opportunity for the bookstore, and it will be dedicating its efforts to taking advantage of it.
“We’ve been doing this for quite some time,” he said. “We’ve got a veteran staff, and this is our game time. We need all hands on deck.”

USC swimming and diving will face Arizona and ASU in back-to-back dual meets this weekend, starting with the Wildcats on Friday.
Arizona was shell-shocked after an upset last season when the Trojans beat the 2008 NCAA Champions 164-136 on the women’s side and 152-91 on the men’s.
Fired up · USC swimming coach Dave Salo said defending champion Arizona will serve as a measuring stick for the up-and-coming Trojans. -Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
But this year, USC is no longer the underdog and Arizona, one of the top three teams in the country, is well aware of what is coming.
“If we are going to challenge for a team NCAA title in the next few years, we have to be able to compete against the very best like Arizona,” USC coach Dave Salo said.
Sibling rivalry will be pushed to the limit when USC’s freshman distance star Haley Anderson takes on her older sister, Wildcat sophomore Alyssa Anderson, who was ranked in the top 10 in two individual events at the NCAA Championships last season.
USC’s Anderson is no rookie, coming in second at the World Championship Trials this summer.
The men’s team feels confident in its sprint events after Arizona’s mistake-ridden 50-freestyle last weekend against Wisconsin, when freshman Nick Popov and junior Craig Jordens both false-started. Jordens failed to realize his mistake until completing the entire 50 meters.
Sophomore Jeff Daniels and junior transfer Emmett Walling will be the Trojans to watch in this event.
“We’re ready to give the Wildcats a serious run for their money,” said men’s sophomore captain Patrick White said. “The freshmen are going to get a chance to feel what it’s like to truly earn a victory.”
The women’s 200 butterfly might be the nail-biting event of the day, with the Trojans dishing up four of the best flyers in the country: All-American sophomore Tanya Krisman, All-American junior transfer Lyndsay DePaul, All-American sophomore Katinka Hosszu and freshman Yumi So.
“It’s going to be a great meet — very competitive with close finishes,” said women’s senior captain Krissy Forelli. “We’ve been preparing for this meet from the moment we won last year.”
Following a stellar performance at the Trojan Diving Invitational, the diving team looks to continue its success this weekend. Sophomores Victoria Ishimatsu and Harrison Jones swept all their events at the invitational and are showing no signs of slowing down.
On Saturday, the Trojans will travel to Tempe, Ariz. to take on the Sun Devils, a once-strong team that has endured unsettling changes after their men’s team was temporarily terminated due to budget cuts in 2008.
“ASU is rebuilding their program and will no doubt be under-manned this year,” Salo said.
The key to beating ASU will be staying focused after a tough day of competition against Arizona. The team will be traveling on a flight the same day they face the Wildcats, so remaining mentally alert and tough will be vital to both days of competition.
“Everyone knows the task at hand and I have a feeling we’re going to have some breakthrough performances,” Forelli said. “I’m excited and can feel the energy throughout the team.”
For the men’s team, there will be many Trojan debuts, this being the team’s first official dual meet of the season. Freshmen to watch will be top US recruit Alex Lendrum in the 100 and 200 backstroke, and Clement Lefert, who will compete in the butterfly events as well as cover for sophomore Richard Charlesworth, who will not swim because of eligibility reasons.
“The freshmen have raced a lot of [the men’s team] before in meets over the summer,” said James Martin, the men’s senior captain. “They might have some jitters at first but if we can build some momentum off the first relay the freshmen will fall into line and they will be awesome.”
The Trojans will be hoping to add to their list of NCAA Championship A and B cuts this weekend. Hosszu, DePaul, So, Krisman and freshman Jessica Schmitt have already scored NCAA consideration times for the women’s team, and Lefert and junior Dillon Connolly have scored B cuts for the men’s team so far this season.
