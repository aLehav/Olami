On Tuesday, the Annenberg School of Journalism and the Center on Communication Leadership & Policy hosted “Through Her Lens: Women & Photojournalism,” an event that explored the role of photojournalists and evaluated the opportunities and challenges females face in pursuing careers in photojournalism.
Girl Power · From left to right: Lori Shepler, Marissa Roth, Pamela Peters and Barbara Davidson spoke with students about their experiences and challenges they faced as female photojournalists. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Pulitzer Prize-winning Los Angeles Times staff photographer Barbara Davidson, award-winning photojournalist and documentary photographer Marissa Roth, multimedia documentarian Pamela Peters and award-winning photographer and author Lori Shepler were among the featured guest speakers headlining the event.
USC professor Geoffrey Cowan opened the panel humorously with the question, “Do female photographers shoot in a different eye?”
Davidson then started the discussion by presenting her photos that were taken in Iraq, Afghanistan, Congo, Israel, Gaza and Bosnia. She wanted to empower the victims of humanitarian crises such as war through her photographs.
Barbara Davidson, winner of the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography, a 2011 National Emmy and the 2006 “Newspaper Photographer of The Year,” has been a staff photographer for the Los Angeles Times since 2007.
Though she has experienced many traumatic events through her camera lens, Davidson stressed the importance of remaining professional.
“My role as a photojournalist is to educate,” Davidson said. “If I am not able to put myself together, I am not doing my job. The photography is just a small part in this picture. Listening to their stories and riding the journey with them are the main purposes of documenting.”
Inspired by the 1961 film The Exiles, Pamela Peters had a similar vision. With her photographs, she wanted to accurately portray the lives of the Native Americans who live in cities.
“I wanted to create accurate and humanistic images of young Native Americans in Los Angeles that had never been in mainstream movies in Hollywood,” Peters said.
The discussion was later followed by a Q&A session. Questions were mostly centered on whether women took photographs differently and whether they had encountered sexism in the news.
“Stereotypes are out there but you just have to be professional,” Roth said. “Competition in the industry was challenging earlier on, but as long as you are professional, you can overcome these obstacles.”
The female photojournalists argued that they could offer unique perspectives to topics that are typically considered masculine, such as sports.
“I believe that women can bring unique perspectives to many topics,” Shepler said. “[A] camera is just a tool. People think that my pictures are different because I am there to capture emotions and that makes me so much better.”
Audience member Ewa Glowaczewska was thrilled to finally meet the award-winning Barbara Davidson.
“I am currently not enrolled in USC but in Santa Monica College,” Glowaczewska said. “My biggest passion is photojournalism and I found Barbara Davidson on Annenberg’s website which inspired me to attend this event. I am seeking a career in photojournalism and this is a perfect opportunity for me.”
Taoran Zhou, a first-year graduate student studying communication management, thought the forum provided many valuable insights with regards to women and their leadership in journalism.
“I am interested in gender when I do my research in journalism so I am very glad to understand how photographers see the world and how they interpret opinions about women,” Zhou said.

The New York Times readership program has been renewed, giving USC students access to the daily newspaper on campus and online starting next week.
Read all about it · The New York Times is now available for students at Tutor Campus Center, the Annenberg School and Leavey Library. – Kevin Fohrer | Daily Trojan
“The New York Times readership program was started in the spring semester of 2013,” said Michael Yoshimura, USG’s director of Academic Affairs. “When we looked over the budget for the spring semester, it made sense to continue it.”
In order to expand its readership base, The New York Times offers discounts to student organizations at major universities.
“[The New York Times education staff] gave us a presentation on their readership program, and it sounded like a great way for students to learn what’s going on outside USC,” Yoshimura said.
Physical copies of the daily paper will be placed in special racks near Leavey Library, the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and the Annenberg School each week from Monday to Friday. The directors say this spring’s distribution is an increase from last semester’s.
“We’re actually getting more copies now, as well as a new online subscription,” said Logan Burkhead, USG’s assistant director of Academic Affairs.
USG has registered for 200 digital licenses per day, which students can obtain by going to nytimes.com/passes  and registering with their USC email address. Students logging in will be given 24-hour access to subscriber content on the website.
Yoshimura and Burkhead hope this new feature will increase the subscription’s popularity and result in even more educational opportunities for USC students in months to come.
“We want to extend the program in the future,” Burkhead said. “We’re hoping to have an actual New York Times columnist come in by the end of the semester and give a presentation to students.”
The directors believe that in comparison to other papers, such as the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times offers the “best package” to college students.
“It seems like The New York Times is an elite publication, and it deals on a national scale,” Yoshimura said. “And considering everything else they’re giving us, they really set themselves apart.”

By combining the elements of entrepreneurship, technology and education, Professor Kathleen Allen has launched herself as one of the leading faculty members at USC.

Allen, who was recently awarded the 2014 Entrepreneurship Educator of the Year Award from the United States Association for Small Business and Entrepreneurship, has been a USC professor for more than 20 years at the Marshall School of Business and the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurship Studies.
USC Vice Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs Gareth M. James stressed how high an honor Allen’s award was.
“In making its selection from among a large pool of deserving nominees, the awards committee specifically commended Dr. Allen’s extensive and exemplary record of publication that includes some of the best-selling entrepreneurship textbooks in the world,” James said.
The veteran professor has helped propel the school’s entrepreneurial program to the top, and James G. Ellis, dean of the USC Marshall School of Business, noted how beneficial her contributions have been.
“Kathy Allen has been critical to helping our Lloyd Greif Center Entrepreneurial Studies program grow into the leading entrepreneurial studies program it is today,” Ellis said. “She has become the go-to person to help USC students, alumni and faculty commercialize complex technology ideas. We could not be more proud.”
The Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, the first entrepreneurship program in the United States, was established in 1972. It aims to equip students with the comprehensive skills required to start and manage a successful new business venture.
The program is currently ranked among the top undergraduate and graduate entrepreneurial programs in the nation. In 2013, Entrepreneur magazine ranked the program No. 3 on its list of Top 25 Undergraduate College and Business Schools. Businessweek with U.S. News and World Report describing The Greif Center as “one of the best” in the country.
According to her article “The Value of Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration,” Allen has dedicated her teaching and research to “the business of commercializing technological innovations developed by university scientists.”
Professor Kathleen Allen, however, has quite the unconventional background. With degrees in business, foreign language and music, her role in the technological field at first can seem quite misplaced. Yet her background is exactly what gave her the edge she needed.
“My experience in business and entrepreneurship enabled me to bring to the table a set of unique skills and a market perspective that scientists, physicians, and engineers didn’t have,” Allen said in her article.
Though now well-established in the field of entrepreneurship, Allen revealed that her passion did not begin until later in her life when she entered the business industry for the first time. This newfound interest was fueled by the desire to be her own boss.
“I have always been interested in technology because I grew up with a father who always brought home the latest technology gadgets,’’ Allen said. “However, entrepreneurship was a field that I did not get into until my 30s when I first started my business. I never wanted to work for someone else. Entrepreneurship provides me the ownership I always wanted.”
Allen is also a leading proponent of cross-disciplinary education. She is a founding director of the Marshall Center for Technology Commercialization, an interdisciplinary partnership founded in the 1990s to support entrepreneurship education across USC’s business, medical and engineering schools.
“My courses in entrepreneurship and technology commercialization bring together business, science, and engineering students to create diverse perspectives that produce new insights and a level of creative and critical thinking I have not seen in more discipline-focused classes,” Allen said in her article.
Sandra J. Chrystal, vice dean for online education at Marshall, expressed the importance of Allen’s cross-disciplinary contributions.
“Professor Allen’s vision, commitment and research have provided Marshall, Keck and Viterbi students and faculty with knowledge focused on commercialization of entrepreneurial technology,” Chrystal said. “She designed and directs the Center for Technology for Commercialization, one of Marshall’s Centers of Excellence. In addition to these unique contributions, she actively engages with the Marshall Faculty Technology committee and several other key Marshall and USC committees.”
Allen is also the owner of four successful businesses and the author of 15 entrepreneurship books, including Launching New Ventures: An Entrepreneurial Approach, Entrepreneurship for Scientists and Engineers.
She hopes to keep expanding the entrepreneurial program in the years to come.
“At USC, I wish to expand the program to the undergraduate level as well as the graduate level,” Allen said. “We also want to develop an online version of the program that could reach out to the people in the industry.”

Approximately 100 students, faculty and staff gathered in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism’s East Lobby Tuesday night to watch President Barack Obama’s fifth State of the Union address. Those in attendance watched intently as the president offered his agenda in front of the 113th United States Congress.
Panelists · (From left to right): Jack Merritt, Bill Simon, Sarah Herald and Dan Schnur speak on a panel co-moderated by Kerstyn Olson and Teddy Davis following President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address. – Kevin Fohrer | Daily Trojan
The president opened on a positive note and addressed a broad purview of issues, focusing on economic growth, the wage disparity and raising the minimum wage.
“Upward mobility has stalled,” the president said in his address. “The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by — let alone get ahead. And too many still aren’t working at all.”
Other issues the president discussed included U.S. technological innovation, energy independence and immigration reform. Vice President Joe Biden, who watched stoically for most of the speech, stood to applaud when the president called for a comprehensive immigration bill.
Though the lobby remained silent for most of the address, cheers erupted from both men and women in the audience when the president addressed inequality in the workplace.
“It is time to do away with workplace policy that belongs in a Mad Men episode,” the president said.
The president concluded honoring wounded Sgt. First Class Cory Remsburg, and invoking his difficult but spirited recovery as analogous to the nation’s.
Following the speech, the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC held a panel featuring Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute who is currently on leave; Bill Simon, co-founder and co-chairman of William E. Simon & Sons, LLC; Sarah Herald, president of the USC College Democrats and Jack Merritt, speaker’s director of the USC College Republicans.
The panel debated the merits of the speech, and whether or not it was a missed opportunity for larger agenda initiatives such as President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 State of the Union call to put U.S. astronauts on the moon.
Democrats and Republicans on the panel also contested unemployment insurance in more depth.
“The president and Congress don’t have a lot of middle ground on the issue,” Schnur said.
Schnur continued to say that the president will not be able to reach bipartisan compromise for unemployment insurance for the remainder of his term.
Students were enthusiastic to interact with the panel when questions were opened up to the floor, tackling issues from gun control to the closure of Guantánamo Bay Prison.
The panel also addressed the president’s failure to mention the debt crisis in the State of the Union.
“Sometimes what people don’t say is just as important as what they do say,” Simon said in response to President Obama’s silence regarding the economy.
In general, students responded favorably to the Unruh panel.
“I thought it was interesting that they were all on the same page, it speaks to the neutrality of the speech this year,” said Annie Wanless, a sophomore majoring in political science.
Other students wished for controversy between the panel’s bipartisan members.
“I came to the panel because I’m part of the College Republicans,” said Lisa Battaglia, a sophomore majoring in communication. “I like having these opportunities where I can learn from the best of the best. I thought the panelists all did really well- -— I kind of wanted more argument, though.”
Still, the general consensus was that the panel capably tackled the tough issues.
“They did a very good job addressing some very challenging topics that generally aren’t easy to address without substantial research and data,” said Eric Dubbury, a junior majoring in music industry.
The speech itself, however, was met with slightly more hesitation.
“Talk is cheap,” Dubbery said. “There is debate as to what is going to go down from the White House as compared to what was being talked about in the speech. People shouldn’t take the State of the Union as something that is set in stone.”

“Reblog,” “like,” “retweet,” “swipe right” — this is the terminology of the current generation. Many USC students are familiar with Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter and Tinder. These are just four of the countless social media apps and platforms that permeate day-to-day life. They are diverse in their functions, but share a common thread — all are superficially woven. “Liking” someone’s new profile picture on Facebook or giving someone a “heart” on Tinder are ways of interacting with a profile that someone has carefully constructed to come across as attractive in some way.
Get Connected · Anomo strives to create friendships between players through icebreaker activities, status updates and check-ins. App users create avatars and communicate with people in their area with the ability to unlock photos and information based on how often they play. – Photo courtesy of Timbre & Post
But what if there were a way to easily form genuine interactions with new people, rather than simply reblogging someone’s selfie or retweeting a heavily premeditated 140-character chunk of thoughts?
Enter Anomo: a revolutionary networking app that allows individuals to anonymously interact with others in their vicinity, yielding real connections before a single photo is exchanged.
“Anomo is an anonymous social network where you reveal information about yourself over time,” said James Sun, the app’s creator. “The best example is that it’s just like a masquerade party, whereas other parties require that you have a name tag with a photo ID.”
Individuals on Anomo are represented by avatars rather than photos. To start meeting people, you select the “Find People” tab located in the left sidebar.  The app generates a list of nearby users, listing only their username, gender, location and tagged interests. Once you’ve chosen an individual, you tap “Play” to begin an icebreaker activity.
“When you play an icebreaker, you answer five questions that are multiple choice, and Anomo figures out how compatible you are,” Sun said. “After that, you start chatting on our app. And if the chat goes well, that’s when people reveal their photos, their major, where they go to school, their name, their Facebook page, and then they follow each other on Anomo to keep in touch.”
Anomo is particularly relevant for college students, especially those at large campuses such as USC. USC students are surrounded by more than 18,000 other undergrads and more than 22,000 grad students, most of whom they will never meet. Anomo provides a convenient method of linking people with common interests, creating connections and community in an environment that can feel overwhelmingly large.
“The people you meet in college are going to become influential in your character, in your career, in the activities you’re involved with, and so it’s really important to meet new people in college,” Sun said. “So I think the problem that we’re solving is, we’re making it easier for people to meet people — especially those who are a little bit more shy. It’s so easy on our app to start interacting with people.”
Anomo is different from other social networking apps in that its purpose is to help its users meet people, whereas most other apps are intended to maintain connections in already-established friendships. Tinder, a mobile dating app, is a notable exception to this rule, but Anomo differs from Tinder in that it is not exclusively a dating app.
“The dating element is secondary — it’s more about people just finding people that are interesting whether it’s girl-guy, guy-guy, girl-girl — it’s about their interests,” Sun said.
In addition to engaging in icebreakers with other users, Anomo users can post statuses, photos and check-ins on their Anomo profiles. When one logs in to Anomo, you are greeted with an activity stream. This feed displays posts from people in your area, and only reveals each poster’s anonymous avatar, username, location and age.
One of the advantages of an anonymous social network is that people tend to post statuses and photos that reveal more intimate, personal details about their lives and struggles. Thus the social network can dually serve as a support network. The purpose of sharing on Anomo is not to boast — profiles are not linked with the user’s real name and image so there would be no point.
“[On Anomo,] people are more real — we have some students on there that talk about things like depression in college, or weight loss in college — those are things you would never post on Facebook or Twitter,” Sun said.
USC students who are looking to meet people their age can utilize Anomo to easily forge new connections.
“In college, a lot of students are looking for dating, for friendship, for professional networking within their friend group, and what we’re seeing is that students on college campuses are more open to meeting new people even more than high school kids,” Sun said. “So there’s something about being in college where you are the most open to meeting new people, and that’s what we’ve seen on our app.”
 
Anomo is currently available for free on both iPhones and Androids.

Week three of classes and we are all still alive and kicking. Congratulations and Happy Wednesday, Trojans! I hope everyone is managing their time well and that their New Year’s diets are still intact — if not, I have a great recipe that might help you stay on track while still satisfying those stubborn cravings. Chances are, this recipe will also get you in your kitchen and away from picking up a Chinese Chicken Salad or a package of sushi from Seeds Marketplace everyday.
Salads can be boring and monotonous to order, as well as to make. The ingredients can be repetitive and the options can become limited — sometimes, all you need are the right ingredients such as bacon, bacon and more bacon.
Aside from my bacon obsession, I recently added three simple ingredients to that list — no, they are not some crazy foodie ingredient such as mangosteens or kale -— the ingredients are freshly grated Parmesan cheese, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Olive oil is one of the most versatile oils around and is also very good for you. I use olive oil to cook vegetables, meats and pastas. Olive oil also goes great on whole grains and of course salad. Parmesan cheese is flat-out delicious and always makes me feel like I am in some sort of classy Italian café, as well as the sweet smell of balsamic vinegar — reminiscent of the warm bread you scarf down with olive oil and vinegar before you give your order to the waiter.
Olive oil, balsamic vinegar and Parmesan seem to be making their way into every entrée I make, from eggy breakfasts to quick lunches, olive oil even makes an appearance when it is time for dessert — like drizzling some on top of ice cream — sounds bizarre, but it’s actually delicious. With these ingredients, I used my culinary skills to make a one-of-a-kind salad — not really.
I got creative with some bacon, lettuce and tomato; then I realized that I started adding all of the vegetables I had in my fridge at that time, magically tossing them here and there, ultimately creating the BLT Cobb College Salad. This salad is exactly as it sounds, part BLT (bacon, lettuce and tomato) without the bread, and part Cobb all chopped up, with a couple extra ingredients such as freshly grated Parmesan cheese, cucumbers, fresh cilantro, balsamic vinegar and olive oil.
In Southern California, there is not a time that is not qualified to have a fresh salad tossed in the middle of it, so here is one that I feel covers all bases: meat, protein, dairy, fruit and the classics. Maybe this plate is not something incredibly new to you, but I like it, especially with extra Parmesan.
Staying on a diet has never been so easy, in my opinion. You can seriously have it all in one salad, and hold the guilt — if you do not have access to a kitchen, dining halls on campus have salad bars that have all of the following ingredients.
The BLT Cobb College Salad
Ingredients
1 head of romaine lettuce
4 hard-boiled eggs
1 large cucumber
2 tomatoes
8 pieces of thick cut bacon (can also use turkey bacon and as much as you want)
Olive oil
Balsamic vinegar
Salt
Pepper
Parmesan cheese
Fresh bunch of cilantro, washed and dried
Directions
Boil the eggs.
While the eggs are boiling, take the cucumbers, tomatoes and head of lettuce and chop them into bits.
Put the slices of bacon on a skillet, and cook to your liking. Once done, place on a paper towel to absorb the extra grease, then chop the bacon to bits.
Take the cooled eggs and chop them to bits.
Toss all the ingredients in a bowl.
Take the fresh cilantro and pull off the leaves and place in the bowl.
Add salt and pepper to taste, and add about two tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, and four tablespoons of olive oil — feel free to add more or less of each ingredient.

It doesn’t take a venture capitalist to figure out food trucks are a risky business: The grueling hours, the ceaseless competition, constant jostling for prime real estate and the ephemeral nature of singularly focused food trends are all factors as to why a food truck is just as, if not more, susceptible to the risks of opening a restaurant. It makes sense, then, that a successful food truck concept such as The Bun Truck would have fewer qualms than your average restaurant opening a brick-and-mortar business in Koreatown, an area notorious for restaurants going belly-up in the face of trend-based turnovers.
Hot crossed buns · Korean fusion restaurant The Bun Shop, an expansion of The Bun Truck food truck, delivers with delicious menu items – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
The Bun Shop opened earlier this month in the wake of one such closure: It occupies the former space of King Hot Dog, a Korean fusion hot dog concept that closed its doors in July 2013, just five months after opening. Unlike King Hot Dog, however, The Bun Shop seems up to the task of transforming a notoriously tricky location on the corner of Western Avenue and Council Street into a casual pub destination.
Korean fusion is nothing new in Los Angeles’ dining scene. What Roy Choi did with Kogi was seen as more or less a blueprint for the successful business — take food from two cuisines and fuse them together in a convenient, street-friendly package. The Bun Shop, however, doesn’t seem content with attempting to haphazardly mesh two disparate food cultures that sound good on paper. The buns are soft, pillowy mounds stuffed with a variety of meats, ranging from Korean bulgogi to pork belly to panko-fried chicken katsu.
Each thoughtfully conceived bun reads like a melting pot of culture. In the “Spicy Pig,” the Korean dwaeji-bulgogi takes on the traditional flavors of caramelized red pepper paste, ginger and garlic. A dash of Southeast Asian Sriracha sauce kicks up the heat, before freshly sliced cucumbers and a cool Greek tzatziki sauce mellow out the proceedings. Cucumbers are a Korean food staple and are oftentimes served with Korean barbecue, yet using the yogurt and cucumber-based tzatziki to balance the heat of Korean spicy pork is not only a ballsy move on paper — the tastes play against each other in marvelous fashion.
The “Beefy” reads a bit overwrought in theory: a stellar bulgogi is paired with an aioli that takes on the flavor profile of the beef marinade, and a tempura-fried onion adds a textural element to contrast the soft bun. Thankfully, the “Beefy” doesn’t taste nearly as complicated as it sounds: It’s a small (and simply tasty) bulgogi slider.
The word “simple” loses its more negative connotations when individual elements are so well-executed. A made-to-order “Katsu” bun contains a sinfully crispy panko-fried cut of juicy chicken breast. A “simple” side salad includes some mixed greens and a cornichon mixed in a miso vinaigrette, which could be inserted in any of the buns to lend another acidic counter-balance to some of the heavier meats.
But of all The Bun Shop’s culinary accomplishments, none match the heinously addictive “Shop Fries”: crunchy, garlicky, McDonald’s-width shoestring fries are served with a side of dill ranch sauce. There were no survivors.
Other menu items read like a list of Korean anju, or bar snacks: “Ba’corn Cheese,” a bacon-adulterated take on a Korean pub favorite, “Sticky Wings” that come with a side of pickled daikon radish and some of the better sweet potato fries in Los Angeles (The Bun Shop’s rendition comes seasoned with paprika and with a side of honey cream for dipping). All of these bar snacks lead to another point: The Bun Shop has yet to receive its beer and wine license — and yes, they are applying for one. The one advantage that The Bun Shop has over The Bun Truck is that they will have the ability to serve alcohol. Much of the storefront’s menu seems to complement a cold pint of craft beer (or any beer, really).
The overall direction of The Bun Shop’s menu is partially a Koreans vs. everybody fusion concept, but also a version of a Korean pub menu — and The Bun Shop already looks every bit the part of a pub. The ambiance is attractive, with smooth, black walnut wood booths and dangling ceiling lights. A wall-sized, graffiti-like mural pays homage to the shop’s food truck roots, with large storefront windows looking out at traffic on Western Avenue. The posh aesthetic is both sleek and smart, without being pretentious. A storefront such as this looks like it belongs in Downtown or off La Brea or Fairfax — instead, it’s situated in Koreatown, where competition is cutthroat and turnover moves at a breakneck pace. But with such culinary finesse and a deeply-rooted Korean pub concept, you get the feeling that The Bun Shop on Western wouldn’t have it any other way.

USC students who aren’t typically fans of collegiate swimming might find a good reason to head to Uytengsu Aquatic Center this weekend, as the No. 5 Women of Troy will be hosting Olympic champion Missy Franklin and the No. 1 Cal Bears as well as the No. 4 Stanford Cardinal.
Franklin burst into the national spotlight at the 2012 London Olympic Games, winning four gold medals and one bronze medal, and setting two world records at the age of 17.
Franklin has continued her success at Cal, currently holding the top times in the 200-yard free and the 500-yard free. Her dominance has led Cal to an undefeated season so far, including a 190-109 win over Arizona and a crushing 229-69 victory over Arizona State last weekend.
Stanford is likewise undefeated after sweeping the two Arizona teams last weekend. The Cardinal are led by All-Americans Maya DiRado and Maddy Schaefer. DiRado currently holds the nation’s top time in the 200-yard IM, while Schaefer shares the top time in the nation in the 50-yard free.
The Women of Troy’s roster also boasts multiple national leaders who have led the team to an undefeated mark. Senior All-American Kasey Carlson set the fastest time in the 100-yard free this season, the second-fastest in the 100-yard breast and the third-fastest in the 50-yard free. Sophomore Kendyl Stewart, senior Stina Gardell and sophomore Jasmine Tosky, all three of whom also earned All-American honors last season, are ranked in the top five of their events this season.
This weekend’s performance will be particularly crucial for Gardell, Carlson and the other three seniors on the Women of Troy’s roster: Lolo Blair, Meghan Hawthorne and Lynette Lim. Saturday will be Senior Day, serving as the last home meet for these decorated swimmers, who have accrued a total of 22 All-American honors between them.
Last year, the top-ranked Women of Troy pulled out a 155-145 win over California in Berkeley, Calif. with Gardell clinching the victory for USC. The next day, USC headed to Palo Alto, Calif. to take on the second-ranked Cardinal and suffered its first loss of the season, falling 158-137 to Stanford.
The fourth-ranked Women of Troy will undoubtedly aim to exact revenge this year at home. USC will host Cal on Friday at 3 p.m. and will face off against Stanford on Saturday at noon. All three teams will then head to the Pac-12 championships in Federal Way, Wash.

It’s been an intriguing week for USC football recruiting, as five-star quarterback and former Alabama recruit Ricky Town de-committed from the Crimson Tide and gave his verbal commitment to USC. Though there’s plenty of intrigue about Town’s potential at the college level, the high school junior (class of 2015) still isn’t going to put on a Trojan uniform until after next season. The class of 2014 recruiting season, however, is about to be finalized, and precisely a week from now, National Signing Day will set all the new recruits and rosters in stone.
Though the vast majority of the Trojans’ 2014 recruits are expected to sign their letters next Wednesday, there are a couple key recruits the Trojans will need to pursue in order to take 2014’s recruiting class from “intriguing” to “outstanding.”
The first of these recruits is Gardena, Calif. safety/athlete Adoree’ Jackson: listed at 5-foot-9 and a solid 182 pounds with a 4.44 40 yard dash, Jackson has yet to commit. According to 247sports.com, however, Jackson is a solid favorite to follow in the footsteps of his fellow Junipero Serra High School alumni Marqise Lee, George Farmer and Robert Woods in taking his talents to South Central.
Watching film of the 2012 CIF SS Western title game between Junipero Serra and Chaminade, it becomes quickly apparent that Jackson is no ordinary athlete. On one particular kick return, the recruit’s next-level athleticism is on full display. He has the long, fluid strides of a track runner and transitions effortlessly between evading defenders, maintaining his balance and immediately firing on some world-class jets to torch his pursuers.
Jackson seems to have an otherworldly grasp of his body’s internal momentum, to the point where he’s spinning and pirouetting naturally not just in a flashy way to avoid defenders, but employing the circular motion with force to twist free from poorly executed shoestring tackles.
This type of fluidity of movement makes him best suited at a defensive back position and as a kick returner, though the possibilities offered by his athletic versatility are practically endless. He has fantastic hip flexor and upper body control, and could make for a very long 60 minutes for opposing Pac-12 receivers. Jackson is a consensus five-star athlete, and though he hasn’t set a schedule for his last official visits quite yet, his final three schools (in no particular order) include USC, that one school across town which will remain unnamed and the University of Florida.
Another top recruit and five-star athlete the Trojans could haul in is John “JuJu” Smith from Long Beach Poly High School in Long Beach, Calif. According to 247sports’ “Crystal Ball,” Smith is heavily favored to commit to USC. Smith is the 20th ranked player in the nation according to the site and the No. 4 recruit in the state of California.
Smith, who was a two-way star in high school, draws comparisons to another Long Beach Poly graduate: Cal alumnus and Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeSean Jackson. But position and high school are where the comparisons end. Whereas the 5-foot-10 DeSean Jackson had game-changing speed and agility that translated well to big-play potential on offense, Smith’s strength and coverage instincts on intermediate routes could land him a spot at free safety.
This assessment is not to rule out any possibilities. A review of Smith’s game film against Santa Ana-Mater Dei reveals one of his greatest assets: Smith’s size and wingspan. It would be unsurprising if Smith came to USC and became part of an already deep wide receiving corps. At 6-foot-1, 200 lbs., the Long Beach Poly senior already has professional size and is capable of breaking tackles and tacking on yards after the catch.
Adding Adoree’ Jackson and John “Juju” Smith could be two huge flourishes on the USC recruitment haul, and could bump the Trojans into the top 20 of overall rankings for recruiting classes.
Though the Trojans could run into depth issues in the trenches with the departure of defensive lineman George Uko and offensive lineman Marcus Martin, junior college transfer Claude Pelon, who enrolled for the spring semester earlier this week, should be part of the solution to that problem.
The Trojans have also addressed needs at the offensive line by recruiting two of California’s top three offensive linemen in Toa Lobendahn and Viane Talamaivao. Both are rated as consensus four-star recruits and will provide valuable depth on the Trojans’ thinning offensive line.
In many ways, 2014 is shaping up to be a highly successful recruiting class for the USC Trojans -— not only as a way to build depth on the roster, but laying the foundation for future success.
So sure, Ricky Town is verbally committed to USC for the recruiting class of 2015 — but the Trojan faithful have plenty to be excited about in the more immediate future.

UPDATE: in an earlier version of this article it was reported the Trojans would need to replace senior offensive lineman Aundrey Walker. The article has been corrected to refer to Marcus Martin, who will be leaving to the NFL.
When did Walker announce he was leaving? Maybe you mean Marcus Martin from the offensive line.

After finishing the first day of the Arizona Intercollegiate with a two-stroke lead, the USC men’s golf team struggled mightily yesterday and fell to fourth place in the final standings. The No. 22 Trojans’ best mark was a 4-over 75 from senior Jeffrey Kang, just a day after the team recorded four individual scores of 70 or below. Only last-place finisher George Washington finished below the Trojans on yesterday’s leaderboard.

USC’s struggles allowed No. 3 California to recover from a tournament-worst 3-over to claim first place, while host Arizona and No. 16 New Mexico also leapfrogged the Trojans during the final round. New Mexico State and Brigham Young tied for fifth.
The Trojans appeared as if they would compete for the title after a strong performance on the front nine, but failed to keep up that pace over the second half of the day at Sewallo Golf Course in Tucson, Ariz. Head coach Chris Zambri was not pleased by the day’s results.
“It was a very disheartening day,” the 8th-year coach said. “The course played quite difficult.”
After leading the individual race for nearly all of Monday’s 36 holes, junior Anthony Paolucci’s team-worst 8-over 79 forced him into a fifth-place tie with New Mexico’s Sam Saunders and New Mexico State’s Pat Beyhan. Though not good enough to earn his first collegiate victory, Paolucci’s overall 1-over still ranked as the Trojans’ top score.
Kang finished tied for 12th, while freshman Rico Hoey slid to 23rd place after a 7-over 78. Hoey appeared to be headed in the right direction after a 1-under performance in Monday’s second round, but could not build on that strong effort. The highly touted Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. native earned the team’s No. 1 seed with a win in the Gifford Collegiate this fall, finishing just ahead of teammate Paolucci.
Junior Eric Sugimoto, the Trojans’ No. 3 seed coming into the tournament, did not qualify after disappointing scores of 9-over and 10-over in the first and third rounds. The transfer from Pacific did show the brilliance that made him a 2013 Big West conference medalist with a strong 1-under second round.
Paolucci extended his lead over Cal’s Brandon Hagy over the first nine holes, but mirrored his team by fading as the day went on. Hagy went on to share the individual championship with teammate Joel Stalter, who led all players on the day with a 4-under 67. Arizona’s Kolton Lapa and BYU’s Justin Keiley finished a stroke behind at 1-under.
Zambri admitted that his team’s preparation for the final round could have been better.
“Perhaps we came out tight because we had the lead,” Zambri said. “This is not the type of course you want to play if you are mentally tight.”
The Trojans now have a few weeks off before the Amer Ari tournament in Hawaii starting Feb. 6, which will feature Pac-12 rivals No. 9 Stanford and No. 16 UCLA. The team then heads to the Prestige Tournament at PGA West in Indian Hills, Calif., beginning Feb. 17.
Even with such a disappointing result to begin the spring season, Zambri is confident that strong veterans such as Paolucci can gel with skilled newcomers such as Hoey and Sugimoto.
“We will pick ourselves up,” Zambri said. “We have a ton of golf left this semester.”

After an upset loss at the hands of conference rival Cal State Northridge last Friday, the men’s volleyball team looks to rebound in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play tonight against Cal Baptist. The Trojans (4-2, 3-2) were swept by Cal State Northridge in three sets by a score of 25-19, 25-21, 25-21.
On the attack · Junior middle blocker Robert Feathers and his team will seek to rebound from their loss to CSUN against Cal Baptist tonight at the Galen Center. Feathers has recorded 26 kills so far this season. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
Redshirt senior opposite outside hitter Tanner Jansen led the team with seven kills during the matchup at Cal State Northridge (2-3, 2-3), but it wasn’t enough to stop the Matadors, who served for nine aces and had 12.5 blocks against the Trojans.
“We really had some issues passing the ball,” head coach Bill Ferguson said. “We made 14 service errors, and we had nine reception errors, so in essence we gave them two points shy of a full set on first contacts of the rally. That was the key factor. We just couldn’t get anything going. Every time we started to get something going, we just shot ourselves in the foot with a service error or a defensive error.”
USC came into the matchup ranked as the No. 4 team in the country while Cal State Northridge had not yet cracked the top 15. The Trojans dropped to No. 5 in this week’s American Volleyball Coaches Association poll with the Matadors jumping to No. 13. The Trojans will have to try to avoid another upset against unranked Cal Baptist.
Ferguson said that the team needs to cut out the defensive errors to get back to its winning ways.
“We’re just looking to get back on track passing the ball,” he said. “That’s been one of our strengths so far this year, and Cal Baptist serves really tough.”
Ferguson said that Cal Baptist will primarily run its offense through the middle rather than on the outside. Though the Lancers  could make adjustments and hit from the outside if the Trojans choose to overload the middle, the team is most concerned with preparing  for Cal Baptist’s skilled middle blockers.
“They have two middles that are excellent,” Ferguson said referring to 6-foot-11 Kristopher Johnson and 6-foot-8 Amir Lugo-Rodriguez. “They create some matchup issues. Their offense runs through the middle, then they set a fast ball to the outside, but they want to run the middle first.”
Because the Lancers have much stronger middle blockers than outside hitters on offense, he said he will likely start defensive-oriented junior outside hitter Chris Lischke rather than the stronger offensive threat in junior middle blocker Robert Feathers along with usual starter freshman Andy Benesh. Ferguson said Feathers will probably come in as a substitute late in the game, however, if USC needs a spark on offense.
“Robert seems to be better off the bench than Chris,” Ferguson said. “It’s not really a punishment, it’s just that [Feathers is] the guy that can change the energy really quick in a good way. His ability to change the energy is really important and I don’t know if that’s Chris’ nature as much, but that’s something Robert’s able to do.”
With wins over Long Beach State, UC Irvine and UC San Diego but losses to Pepperdine as well as Cal State Northridge in conference play, the Trojans sit in the fifth spot in MPSF rankings. The Matadors are tied for sixth in the 13-team conference and Cal Baptist is tied for ninth. The Lancers beat UC San Diego in five sets this season but have been swept by Cal State Northridge, Long Beach State and UC Irvine.
The matchup against Cal Baptist comes three days before another crucial conference home game for the Trojans against BYU. The Cougars, who come to town Saturday, sit atop the conference standings after winning all six of their MPSF matchups so far this season. BYU is ranked fourth in the country. Pepperdine sits at No. 3, and UCLA is tied for first with Loyola-Chicago. The Trojans defeated Loyola-Chicago before the start of conference play earlier this season. Ferguson said he would love for the team to bring some momentum into Saturday’s game against BYU with a win tonight.
“That would be huge, it definitely would be,” he said. “If we’re able to bounce back and have a good game passing the ball, then we’ll be alright.”
The Trojans begin play at 8 p.m. tonight at the Galen Center.
 
Why didn’t Feathers play at all vs. CSUN? The way the match was proceeding he should have been
inserted in the first set. Great strategy by Coach Ferguson and staff to be swept by the Matadors who
were UN-ranked at the time. Tanner Jansen only played the third set. The program has dropped
significantly since two –  three years ago with lack luster recruiting for some reason.

When I was young, my elementary school had an annual fire drill. When my parents were in elementary school, they participated in Cold War-era duck-and-cover drills to protect themselves from atomic bomb threats. Today, proposed legislation in states throughout the nation could have K-12 children performing annual lockdown drills. Such drills, however bold they might seem, are necessary requirements to ensure school safety.
Lockdown, or shooting-incident drills, have been integrated into the list of schools’ annual drills to conduct given the public’s growing awareness of increased school shootings, according to The New York Times. In states such as New Jersey and Michigan, K-12 students perform lockdown drills every year.
In other states, there are less strict rules surrounding how schools should conduct lockdown drills. California, for example, requires that elementary and intermediate schools conduct a fire drill at least once a month, whereas secondary schools must conduct no less than two every year, according to the California Education Code. If proposed bills are passed, it would specify both exactly how schools conduct the lockdown drills and the regularity of these drills.
The lobbying for these additional drills is not without merit. Mass shootings have become more deadly in the past decades, according to the Center for Disease and Control.  Of the 12 deadliest shootings in U.S. history, six have taken place since 2007, according to the Washington Post.
Furthermore, school shootings rank among the deadliest mass shootings in the United States. In 2007, the deadliest mass shooting in the United States occurred at Virginia Tech, leaving 33 people dead. The second deadliest occurred at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December of 2012, during which 26 people were killed — 20 of whom were children.
On Jan. 21, the country witnessed yet another deadly school shooting at Purdue University, where the shooter killed another student in a classroom, according to The New York Times. Shootings are occurring with more frequency, and now is the time to start preparing for them.
Preparation, as it was in the past, is key to maintaining a high level of school safety. Many students will never experience a fire at their school, but because of the drills they know how to react to one. The same should be true of incidents when an intruder comes into the school with deadly intentions.
Many adversaries to legislation for mandatory lockdown drills argue that students will lose their innocence if exposed to lockdown drills. This concern, however, should not trump the necessity to give students the information that could save their lives in a situation as dangerous as a school shooting. Some parents have argued that kids are losing their innocence having to hide in closets and corners while police officers walk through the school’s halls conducting the drill. Yet, school policy often responds to the ways of the world. If there are several incidents of school shootings, and evidence that these drills could help protect children in cases of intruders, they should be conducted.
Schools should be safe havens for students. But even more so, schools should be facilities for students to gain insight into the world around them. Because of recent school shootings that are seemingly becoming common occurrences, school administrators should feel obligated to conduct applicable safety drills.
As with any drill, there is the concern that students can become desensitized. If performed too often or without seriousness, students often come to believe the drills are unnecessary. A codified state law that mandates lockdown drills, however, would work toward showing how concerned the state is about students’ safety.
From Columbine in 1999 to Purdue last week, the threats against children in schools are manifesting, and society must prepare children for the world they live in.
This country has witnessed school shooting after school shooting. Not only do we need to prepare for the unimaginable, but we must take action and implement mandatory lockdowns. The decision to conduct lockdown drills on a frequent basis should not be left to school districts. States should take charge and make the decision, as they do with several other school requirements.
An atomic bomb thankfully never fell on my parents’ generation, but they still repeatedly ducked and covered under their desks in preparation. In the same way, school administrators and students need to prepare for this generation’s tangible and recognizable threat. Even if students never have to apply this drill in real life, knowing what to do in cases of danger is one of the most important pieces of knowledge a school can provide.

The past three years have been eventful for the Egyptian people. From the removal of former President Hosni Mubarak to the ousting of former Muslim Brotherhood political party leader and President Mohamed Morsi, chaos in Egypt appears to have no end in sight. Yet, on Jan. 14, the Egyptian people voted in favor of a new military-backed constitutional referendum, according to the Washington Post. Despite the overwhelming approval of the constitution and its improvements from previous constitutions, there is still much to be desired if Egypt is to flourish as a democracy.
Arnav Garg | Daily Trojan
 
Egypt’s Supreme Electoral Committee released the official result of the two-day referendum on Jan. 18, showing that 98.1 percent of the participants voted to approve the 2014 constitution, according to the Washington Post. The overall turnout was 38 percent, with 62 percent — many of whom are young voters — staying away from the polls. The new constitution included provisions the former constitution left out, including safeguards for women’s rights and religious freedom.
Though the poll results seem to represent the public’s desire to move away from the Muslim Brotherhood’s rule, the numbers’ representation of overall Egyptian opinion is questionable. Dissent against this new constitution, primarily by Muslim Brotherhood supporters, was limited by the military. Further, state-run and private news media echoed with endorsements of the charter, rarely giving voice to its critics. Whereas banners urging Egyptians to vote in favor of the new constitution were posted freely, hanging signs opposing the constitution was considered a crime.
Though the military is at fault for responding to Muslim Brotherhood protests with the use of violence, it is important to consider the actions of Muslim Brotherhood supporters after the removal of Morsi — a move supported by millions of Egyptians, according to the The New York Times. Muslim Brotherhood protestors participated in violent activities, including torching two government facilities in Giza. The military’s decision to fight violence with more violence, however, is counterproductive.
Since the fall of Mubarak, Egyptians have made no direct effort to establish a lasting democracy. Because Morsi and Muslim Brotherhood members in government solely focused on promoting radical and questionable interpretations of Islam, the seemingly democratic election of Morsi was anything but. During the election, Muslim Brotherhood party members were accused of taking advantage of and bribing many poor people to vote for them, resulting in a 52 percent approval rating for Morsi.
Though the removal of Morsi by the military was overwhelmingly supported by Egyptians, the manner in which he was removed is a testament to the fact that democracy was not achieved through his presidency. Rather than leave leadership to the military, another election with new political parties should be held to finally lead the Egyptian people to democracy and unity.
The youth of Egypt are the key to moving Egypt forward. The state must attract and include the youth who did not join the polls to bring Egypt back to its feet. Investing in the young people of Egypt is the country’s best bet for bringing back Egypt’s glory days, bringing people together and fixing a broken nation.
Egypt is in shambles because of old ways of thought. New knowledge and new leadership not associated with the military or the Muslim Brotherhood are necessary for Egypt to finally make a truly democratic transition — and it is up to the Egyptian youth to answer this call.
 
Yasmeen Kamel is a freshman majoring in business administration.
 
My brother suggested I would possibly like this blog.
He used to be entirely right. This put up actually made my day.
You cann’t consider just how much time I had spent for this info!
Thank you!
My head is literally going to explode if I read one more article about “achieving democracy in Islamic country______” fill in the blank.
When are we going to learn that Islam is incompatible with democracy.  That Islam and Sharia law are co-joined at the hip and that Sharia law is fundamentally undemocratic.
Yasmeen why can you not see the obvious?  There is not one single Muslim country where true democracy exists.  There is not one Muslim country where non-Muslims are considered equals (which in itself is undemocratic).  There is not one Muslim country where free speech and freedom of the press is respected.  In fact even a country like Turkey which is considered a moderate Muslim country has imprisoned more journalists than all other countries in the world.
Yasmeen, as a Muslim I am amazed you do not understand your own religion.
Yasmeen idealistically calls for Egyptian youth to change their country. I am with Yasmeen, but it will not happen until Egypt undergoes a few more decades, if not more, of cultural evolution. The fellahin elected Morsi as their president, and they are the most numerous class in Egypt, not the sophisticated city dwellers. Egypt, and the rest of the Muslim world, are still in the grip of people who believe that their culture should be the same as in the time of the Prophet (peace be unto him). With that attitude, they are not yet ready to rule themselves, but need Mubarak, or Morsi, or Al-Sissi or another strongman.
Don,
I am afraid that unless Islam goes through a major reformation that democracy will never happen in Muslim dominated countries.
I would suggest the proof is in the pudding.  
Islam and Sharia law can only exist together.  One cannot exist without the other.  Sharia law is profoundly undemocratic.  Islam is at its roots undemocratic.  Sorry, but true.

Charlie Schmidt walked onto the stage at the Echoplex Theater to a soft applause. Despite their excitement, the crowd stayed quiet for the star of the show ¬— not Schmidt, but the easily frightened cat in his hands, known to the Internet community as “Keyboard Cat.” Schmidt’s cat was one of many animal celebrities at the second annual Internet Cat Video Film Festival. The travelling film festival concluded in Los Angeles on Saturday, Jan. 25 at the Echoplex.
The festival showcased 85 of the year’s best cat videos, as selected by the festival’s founder, Will Braden. The “meowvies” were selected from a pool of over 10,000 submissions ranging from seven second Vines to three minute documentaries. Fans could vote on their favourite videos to receive awards in various categories including animation, musical and documentary.
Like Cannes or Sundance, the festival brings together not only the best films, but also their stars. “If cat videos were rock ‘n’ roll, then Keyboard Cat would be Chuck Barry,” Braden said. Stars of equal, if not greater magnitude were also in attendance. Christopher Torres, creator of the Nyan Cat meme, and perhaps the biggest name in cat culture, Grumpy Cat, were both at the venue.
Braden, a cat celebrity in his own right, is known for his webseries, “Henri, le Chat Noir,” which follows the existential musings of his tuxedo cat, Henri. Following Braden’s success, he founded the festival to celebrate cat culture in a communal environment. “It’s not just about watching cat videos,” Braden said. “It’s about watching them together.”
Even though he festival is still in its early years, it has been an overwhelming success. It has sold out every venue, even out-selling Macklemore and Ryan Lewis at the Minnesota State Fair. The line at the Echoplex Theater stretched around the block, with many people unable to get in.
From the outset of the show, it was clear that the event and cat culture as a whole are not for everyone; many, not knowing what they had gotten themselves into, headed for the exits after a few minutes.
Yet the numbers suggest that cat culture, with its videos, Internet memes and apparel, is more than just a small following. Torres’s Nyan Cat has mor than 10 million views on YouTube and Grumpy Cat more than 14 million. The crowd itself represented a wide array of the Los Angeles population with kids, grandparents and everyone in between in attendance. The simultaneous wide-reach and religious following of cat culture is what makes it so unique.
The afternoon’s first attraction was the seven-person band, The Cat Museum. The group, dressed in white lab coats and cat beanies, played a 40 minute set that dragged on a bit. The psychedelic music sounded like a radio caught between the Dubstep and Indian music stations with strange visuals that looked like a cat-lover’s acid trip. The miserable screechings were met with as many boos as cheers; the cat community showed its weird side.
While many were frustrated and put off by the display, unity and positivity returned to the room with the simple image of a kitten nibbling on a slice of watermelon. With the afternoon’s first video, the event got down to what the people wanted to see: cute cats doing funny things, of which there was no shortage in the 90 minutes of video.
For some, the event provided an opportunity to network. Buzzfeed’s “Cat Instagram to Follow in 2014,” Shrampton, and her owner attended the festival to talk to Grumpy Cat’s manager. Other filmmakers had their own booths to scout the local, undiscovered talent. It was the place to be for anyone trying to break into the Internet cat business.
Despite being billed as a film festival, the event was more of a celebration of a shared passion than anything else. Attendees brought their cats, compared gear with one another, and discussed their mutual obsession. People purchased official Nyan Cat or Grumpy Cat apparel at the various booths scattered throughout the venue. Many parties continued their cat endeavours into the evening at the Cat Art Show in Santa Monica. “It’s Cat-urday,” one attendee said.
The most remarkable achievement of the festival is the way in which it took the individual and made it communal. The festival was able to pluck an Internet community from the ether and make it real. “I thought I was just a crazy cat guy,” Braden said. “Turns out I am, but there are millions of others just as crazy as me.”
