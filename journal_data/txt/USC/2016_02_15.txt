The No. 6 Trojans suffered their first two losses the season as the men’s tennis team fell short to No. 2 TCU in the quarterfinals Saturday and No. 10 Wake Forest in a consolation match Sunday in the ITA Men’s Team Indoor Championships.
The losses followed a win in the first round over No. 13 USF Friday to advance in the tournament.
Against TCU, Max de Vroome lost a three-set battle that ended with a 7-3 defeat in the final set tie-break, giving the Horned Frogs a 4-3 win. 
“I’m proud of our effort tonight,” USC head coach Peter Smith said. “It was one of those college tennis matches that you love being a part of. TCU did a great job down the stretch to get the win.”
The Trojans started off with an early lead in the match as de Vroome and Jack Jaede defeated Hudson Blake and Reese Stalder with the final score of 6-4 on Court 2 and Rob Bellamy and Jake DeVine topped Guillermo Nuñez and Alex Rybakov on Court 3 with the final score of 6-3.
At singles, the Horned Frogs started off with two wins on Court 1, where No. 6 Cameron Norrie defeated the Trojans’ No. 33 Nick Crystal 6-1, 6-2, and Eduardo Nava dropped only 3 games in his 6-3, 6-0 win over USC’s No. 43 Logan Smith. 
The Trojans reclaimed the lead thanks to Thibault Forget, who won in straight sets on Court 5, and Jack Jaede, who came back and won 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 after dropping the first set at sixth singles to TCU’s Trevor Johnson. 
On Court 3, No. 38 Nuñez took three sets to overcome No. 104 Jake DeVine. TCU eventually notched the fourth point and punched the ticket for the semifinal when No. 122 Alex Rybakov battled back after losing the first set against de Vroome and finished the match with an epic 6-7, 7-5, 7-6 win. 
On Friday, USC was able to pull out a 4-3 win in the first round against USF. After losing the doubles point, the Trojans went down 0-2 after Peter Bertran defeated Laurens Verboven on Court 5 with the score of 6-2, 6-1. 
USC tied the match at 2-2 thanks to de Vroome and Smith, as they both won in straight sets. Roberto Cid gave the lead back to the Bulls as he defeated Nick Crystal on Court 1 with the final score of 6-3, 6-2. On Court 2, de Vroome upset No. 26 Dominic Cotrone in straight sets.
 With the score tied at 3-3, all the attention shifted toward Court 6, where Forget was tied 1-1 in his match against Vadym Kalyuzhnyy. After the winning the tie-break in the first set, Forget dropped the second set 6-1. Feeling the pressure on him, he pulled out a 6-2 win in the second set, giving the Trojans their sixth win of season.
On Sunday, in the consolation match, the Trojans lost 4-0 to Wake Forest. After losing the doubles point, the Crystal, de Vroome and Smith recorded three losses on Courts 1, 2, and 4, respectively, stopping the play on the other courts. 
USC is now 6-2 on the season. The next competition will take the Trojans to Palo Alto, where they will face Stanford on Friday, Feb. 26, at 3 p.m.

As many people know, Los Angeles is a diverse city with an incredible food scene. I usually have a hard time deciding what type of cuisine I want. The options are endless. Am I craving Korean or Mexican food? Italian or Chinese? Well, there is finally a solution to my problem of indecisiveness: cross-cultural fusion foods. I’ve recently discovered that Los Angeles offers a variety of food mashups. These innovative dishes bring together flavors from different cultures. 
The Ramen Burger
Ramen is a Japanese staple, and burgers are a classic American food. What happens when you combine these foods? You get the crispy crunch of noodles along with the satisfying taste of juicy meat. Try this inventive dish at The Original Ramen Burger or at Tatsu Ramen.

The Sushi Burrito
The sushi burrito is a revolutionary concept. It makes sushi easier to eat than ever. This delicious dish blends Asian and Latin flavors, and the results are spectacular. Jogasaki Food Truck is the place to go in L.A. for this dish. A few favorites are the Spicy Salmon Burrito, Lobster Burrito and the Spicy Tuna Delight Burrito.

Kogi BBQ
Los Angeles is lucky to be home to the iconic Kogi BBQ food trucks. These trucks fuse Korean and Mexican cuisine to create trendy, flavor-packed dishes. They are highly publicized in press and on social media — for good reason. Popular dishes include the kimchi quesadilla with cheddar, buttered kimchi and sesame and the spicy pork tacos with pork belly and gochujang marinade.

Masala Bowls and Naan Rolls
What if a casual restaurant like Chipotle served Indian food? This magical place exists in L.A., and it’s called Urban Masala. It has an assembly line much like Chipotle Mexican Grill but serves Indian food with a twist. Customers can customize basmati rice bowls with different meats including lamb curry and chicken masala. Another option is meat rolled up in naan burrito-style.

Fusion Tacos
SoCal’s Asian fusion dishes are a unique combination of flavors from Mexico and Southeast Asia. L.A. is home to Komodo restaurants and food trucks that serve gourmet fusion tacos. One popular dish is the Komodo taco with sirloin steak, jalapeno aioli and Southwest corn salad. Another top-seller is the Blazin’ Shrimp taco with Singaporean-style shrimp and sour cream salad.

From break ups to make ups and everything in between, “Love U” captures the nuances of college students’ relationships. “Love U” runs in DeeTs on Mondays.  
Dear former valentine,
It’s been two years since you’ve been my valentine. Now what you are to me is something between a distant friend and a memory. Over the course of three years, we had a lot of firsts together. You were my first boyfriend, first love, first heartbreak. During our time together, you taught me a lot of lessons about love. So, in lieu of snuggling up with a special someone this Feb. 14, I’m going to share with you a few things I’ve learned instead.
You taught me that long-distance relationships are hard, but that it’s worth going the distance for some people. As tough as it was to be away from you for months at a time, nothing beat the excitement of picking you up from the airport or opening my front door to see you standing there with open arms.
You taught me that it’s okay, even worthwhile, to be vulnerable. I think it was fairly obvious to both of us that wearing my heart on my sleeve wasn’t my strong suit, that I had a habit of thinking practically rather than emotionally. While neither quality can exist in a vacuum, now I know it would do me a little good to let my feelings out more often rather than bottling them up inside.
You taught me to believe in myself. For three years you were my biggest cheerleader. You told me I was smart and funny and beautiful, but, even more important than telling me all those things that a girl wants to be told, you made it known that you thought I deserved the best. You told me that I do could do anything I set my mind to, and you made it a point to tell me so.
You taught me that “but you broke up with him right?” means nothing because heartbreak can happen even if you’re the one who does the proverbial dumping. Even though I knew it was time that we parted ways, my heart cracked open knowing that I pushed you away — and even more so knowing that that I hurt someone I cared so deeply about.
You taught me that a first love is something not to be forgotten. I still have cards you made me for anniversaries, letters you sent me on Valentine’s Day, a couple screenshots of funny text messages we exchanged. I used to think it was a little sad, maybe even pathetic I that I held onto these mementos; now I know I would have regretted throwing them away. I kept them because they remind me how much love you can have for a person, and how amazing that is. Reading them brings back memories that I’ll always smile back on.
Last — but not least — you taught me that time heals some things, but not everything.  We’ve both seen other people, and you don’t pop into my head as often as you once did. From time to time, though, I wonder if we could still be right for each other somewhere down the line, at a point in our lives when the timing is better for us both. 
Yesterday, you spent this Hallmark holiday with a new valentine. I genuinely mean it when I say I hope you two make each other happy because you deserve that more than anyone I know. But most of all, regardless of who you spend today, or tomorrow, or five years from now with, what I really want to say is thank you for being my former valentine. The fact that my first love was someone as caring and loving as you is something I’ll always hold in a special place in my heart. 
Love,
Your former valentine
