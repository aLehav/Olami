According to his twitter account, @USCnumber19, USC sophomore wide receiver Brice Butler will transfer, citing playing time as the primary reason.  Around 11 p.m. PST Wednesday Butler tweeted the following, “Always will be a part of trojan nation! No regrets, I just gotta go play fball, which isn’t happening here… I love all yall! Always will.”
Butler had not previously indicated he would transfer.
A native of Norcross, Georgia, Butler had a promising freshman year in 2009, totaling 20 catches for 292 yards and two touchdowns. He played in all 12 games and started against Stanford, where he caught six passes for 96 yards, including a 36-yard touchdown grab. As a result, he was named to ESPN.com’s All Pac-10 freshman team.
However, those numbers failed to carry over to 2010, as he was lost amongst a new coaching staff. Despite playing in 12 of 13 games, he caught just nine passes for 112 yards and one touchdown, as he was behind the likes of fellow receivers Robert Woods, Ronald Johnson and Brandon Carswell and tight ends Jordan Cameron, Rhett Ellison and David Ausberry.
While Johnson, Ausberry and Cameron were all seniors, Butler would have faced stiff competition from redshirt freshman Kyle Prater, who was a highly rated recruit last year, as well as two incoming freshman. George Farmer, who is ranked the No. 1 wide receiver and No. 3 prospect overall nationally by Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com, and Victor Blackwell, who is ranked 18th nationally for wide receivers by Rivals, both have committed to USC.
“For the second straight year, USC Juniors and Seniors can transfer to another school without the normal penalty of sitting out a season.” Inaccurate, only seniors can transfer without penalty now. Only banned from a bowl for one more year, so only players w/ 1 year of eligibility left can transfer without penalty.

President C. L. Max Nikias warned students to think twice before attending raves in an e-mail sent Wednesday.
Nikias advised students to be “cognizant of your choices and to make wise decisions during your time here at USC.”
In the letter, Nikias mentioned that several venues near campus­­ ­— including the Los Angeles Coliseum, the Los Angeles Sports Arena and the Shrine Auditorium — routinely hold raves. These events, Nikias said, “present serious risks to all who attend.”
The Shrine | Daily Trojan
The letter went on to list some of the common effects of the drug ecstasy, which is frequently linked to the rave scene.
“Ecstasy, which is common at raves, produces a number of adverse reactions that may include disorientation, anxiety, paranoia, panic attacks and hallucinations,” Nikias wrote. “These reactions, even in mild forms, can create a ripple effect of dangers that lead to catastrophic consequences.”
The letter comes about two months after a USC freshman fell from the sixth floor of Birnkrant Residence Hall after attending Hard Haunted Mansion, a rave at the Shrine Auditorium.
LAPD Deputy Chief Pat Gannon told the Los Angeles Times that based on a police investigation report, it appeared the student had consumed alcohol, marijuana and ecstasy during the rave on Halloween night.
This summer, a 15-year-old girl died at the Electric Daisy Carnival at the Coliseum. The girl did not meet the minimum age requirement of 16 to attend the rave, and doctors told family members that she had ecstasy in her system, according to the Times. More than 185,000 people attended the two-day event, and approximately 120 people were taken to emergency rooms, according to the Times.
The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission plans to meet next week to decide if it will allow the Electric Daisy Carnival to occur this June.
Pasquale Rotella, the owner of Insomniac Inc., one of the two companies that holds raves at the Coliseum, issued a statement in response to Nikias’ letter.
“Insomniac’s events aim to cultivate and enrich the human mind and spirit through the arts — a goal that is perfectly in tune with USC’s own mission statement,” Rotella said. “We are eager to meet with President Nikias to provide more information to him and to address his concerns.”
Insomniac Inc. is hosting another rave, Beyond Wonderland, on March 19 at the NOS Events Center in San Bernardino.
Denzil Suite, USC’s associate vice president of Student Affairs, said Nikias’ letter to the student body was intended to raise awareness about raves.
“I think it was prompted purely out of concern for the well-being of the students,” Suite said. “Some students attend raves and he just wanted to make sure they are making good choices if they decide to do so.”
Linda Dahl, a sophomore majoring in political science and history, said that although the message seems well-intentioned, she thinks USC should not implicitly link drugs and raves.
“The intent of the message is good, but just because you go to a rave doesn’t mean you have to do ecstasy,” Dahl said.
Dahl said that it would be better if USC discouraged drug use in general.
Some students do not believe the message will change the minds of those who attend raves.
“If you are a raver, then you’ll go to a rave no matter what,” said Michael Cheng, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering.
Carol Jun, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said she believes the message will raise awareness, but not alter students’ decisions to attend raves.
“[The people who go to raves] already know about the drugs and they still go to them,” Jun said. “[The message] raises awareness, but I don’t think it will reduce the number of people who go to raves.”
Suite said he believes the message was not meant to change students’ decisions about raves, but to inform students about how to make healthy decisions.
“It’s easy when students are in an environment like this to succumb to the moment,” Suite said. “By giving this information we hope that students will make good personal choices if they decide to attend.”
For those that don’t know, raves have been going on in socal for decades. Nikias claims that they have become a recent problem when in fact raves have been held at venues like the coliseum, sports arena, convention center, and other “massive” venues since the mid-90’s. There has always been a constant back and forth between authority figures and promoters/rave community members.
The bottom line is people love music and attending concerts/raves of all shapes and sizes. Drugs have been a part of the concert/club experience since forever (think jazz, rock, disco, 80’s, raves).
If Nikias really wanted to improve the safety of Trojans, instead of discouraging taking a part of what has turned into a defining musical cultural experience for many the past two decades he and USC should educate students on the risks of using substances in general instead of making raves sound risque which will generate curiosity and lead more students to attend and make possibly bad decisions.
So… who wants to hit up Beyond Wonderland and EDC with me?
[…] Thursday. Meanwhile, Denzil Suite, USC’s associate vice president of Student Affairs, told The Daily Trojan that Nikias’ letter to the student body was motivated only by concern for student […]

The No. 1 USC Trojans continued their five-match road trip with a 25-20, 25-22, 25-22 sweep at No. 6 UC Santa Barbara on Wednesday.
The Trojans (5-0, 5-0) continued to show their outstanding attacking efficiency, finishing the first set with a blazing hot .625 hitting percentage and finishing the match with a .493 hitting percentage in comparison to the Gauchos’ (4-3, 2-2) .337.
Win streak · Senior setter Riley McKibbin has played a vital role in leading the Trojans to a 5-0 start — the program’s best since 1994. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
Senior opposite and co-captain Murphy Troy led the charge with 12 kills, finishing with a remarkable .632 hitting percentage and no hitting errors.
Junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli finished with nine kills and six digs.
“They had some good point runs in the second and third sets,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “They came off some quick spurts at the service line for them. It’s not much to worry about.”
Passing was deft, leading to a high number of opportunities to attack for the Trojans’ two talented middle blockers. Senior middle blocker Austin Zahn finished with seven kills on 11 attempts and junior middle blocker Steven Shandrick finished with seven kills on 10 attempts.
“I really liked that we ran them, and the both did really well,” Ferguson said. “Especially since Austin had a guy committed to him all night.”
Sophomore outside hitter Maddison McKibbin provided a huge block in the third set on Irons. He also had a key dig at the 22-20 mark in transition that gave the Trojans a three-point cushion.
“Maddy came in and did very well, and had a huge effect on two crucial points,” Ferguson said. “Our two-headed monster with [McKibbin] and [Senior outside hitter] Tri Bourne is huge.”
The Trojans also targeted Gauchos senior outside hitter Jeff Menzel in an effort to neutralize his offensive talents.
Senior setter and co-captain Riley McKibbin set the tone for the defense with a stiff block on Menzel on his first attempt.
“Although he’s not that tall, he had a huge block on Menzel,” Ferguson said. “And with Riley being the shorter guy, it really got in his head.”
The Trojans continued the effort with strong serving from Troy.
“Murphy did a great job serving him,” Ferguson said. “He made it tough for him to pass and that made it difficult for him to attack.”
The Trojans outdug the Gauchos 29-21 and outblocked them 11-6. Freshman libero Henry Cassiday continued his impressive inaugural season, tallying nine digs.
Ferguson, however, was not impressed by his team’s defensive execution.
“We didn’t dig as well as we could have,” Ferguson said. “We missed about seven opportunities that I thought were easy plays, but we were a little bit out of position or made a wrong move. Just something to keep an eye on.”

Six years ago, a scrawny kid from Agoura High dreamed of football stardom.
But in his words, the chance of playing collegiate football was “not applicable.”
Although his grandfather, father and uncle starred in the NFL, Clay Matthews III wasn’t the likeliest of candidates to follow in the footsteps of his family.
Only Division-I Football Championship Subdivision schools and community colleges saw the then-6-foot-1, 165-pound Matthews fit to play at their kind of level.
But Matthews thought differently.
Rather than settling, he chose to chase his dream.
Like his father and uncle before him, who chose the great Trojan tradition and left behind an even greater legacy, Matthews picked USC.
“I knew I was capable of playing with the best athletes in the nation,” Matthews told the Los Angeles Times. “I thought I could come in here, day one, and be the guy. Maybe I was crazy to have that mind-set, but obviously that’s better than saying you can’t.”
When Matthews joined the team during the 2004 season, his family legacy continued and a dream was fulfilled.
Finally donning the cardinal and gold, Matthews was an unheralded, unknown player among flashy five-star recruits.
That year, which happened to be the Trojans’ 2004 national championship season, gave Matthews a chance to play, albeit only in garbage time.
Playing time is playing time, but it was far different to Matthews.
The waning minutes of a blowout game are designated for non-scholarship players who put in arguably twice as much work yet receive only minimal reward.
It was at this time that former coach Pete Carroll and former linebackers coach Ken Norton always looked Matthews’ way, asking if he desired to play.
But when Carroll asked, Matthews turned him down.
Every single time.
“I knew that I was capable of so much more,” he told the Times.
To preserve another season of eligibility, Matthews redshirted that year.
Then, he watched as the Trojans signed one of the greatest linebacker classes in history, including Rey Maualuga and Brian Cushing.
Matthews, however, was undeterred.
Still just an ordinary guy among extraordinary talent, his abilities proved worthy enough for Carroll and the rest of his coaching staff to give him a greater opportunity.
Through hard work and an unquestioned desire to improve, he earned an athletic scholarship for the 2006 season, making his presence felt on special teams and as a reserve linebacker.
Three years out of high school, Matthews started making a name for himself.
“I wanted to be the best, and I knew it was going to take hard work, but I was willing to do that,” Matthews said. 
By his senior year at USC, Matthews went from being an unheralded walk-on player to a well-known NFL prospect.
He went from a 6-foot-1, 165-pound kid to a 6-foot-3, 240-pound man.
He also went from the relative obscurity of a walk-on to a significant member of the Trojans defense, which boasted arguably one of the best core of linebackers in collegiate football history.
When his USC career came to an end, Matthews was recognized by the team, becoming the first and only player in team history to earn three consecutive Special Teams Player of the Year awards.
Next up: the NFL.
Matthews impressed scouts so much in pre-draft workouts that the Green Bay Packers traded up to draft the USC standout with the 26th pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.
What was once an afterthought became a reality.
The Packers’ defense improved immediately and Matthews certainly played a role in that success.
The 2009 squad finished second in total defense and first against the run, after it was 20th and 26th in those categories in 2008.
Now, in the two years since being drafted, Matthews has been selected to the Pro Bowl twice and developed a reputation as one of the best pass-rushers in the NFL.
Earlier this season, Matthews became the first player in Packers history to have consecutive three-sack games, and the NFL’s first player to accomplish the feat since Seattle’s Patrick Kerney in 2007.
Anchoring a defense that ranked fifth overall in total defense in 2010, the blonde, long-haired Matthews has become the “mane” man in the Packers’ defensive scheme.
It is because of this defense, and Matthews himself, that the Packers are the first sixth-seeded team to reach the Super Bowl.
Matthews was bred to play football, but it didn’t come easy at all.
“I feel very fortunate to be the player I am today, and I can pretty much say that it was all because of hard work,” Matthews said.
Like his grandfather, father and uncle who starred in the NFL so long ago, Matthews is finally getting a turn.
Six years ago, the same scrawny kid from Agoura High nearly didn’t get a chance.
Now, he’s living the dream.

After disappointing losses at California and Stanford on their road trip to the Bay Area last week, the USC women’s basketball team returns to the Galen Center looking to keep its undefeated home record intact.
“We don’t ever want to lose at home. There’s more incentive to win at home,” said junior guard Ashley Corral.
Expectations · Junior guard Ashley Corral and USC aim to keep their home winning streak alive against Arizona and Arizona State. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
The games against Arizona and Arizona State will have a big impact on the Pac-10 standings, as the Women of Troy (12-6, 4-3) are currently tied with the Wildcats (13-5, 4-3) and the Sun Devils (12-5, 4-3) for third place in the conference. All three teams lead Oregon and Cal by one game and trail UCLA by two games.
Both Arizona and Arizona State have lost three of their past five games, but USC is not underestimating its Pac-10 foes.
“We’re a different team [from last year],” said senior center Kari LaPlante. “We need to come out and execute everything … offense, box out, rebound, and then get back in our transition defense.”
Arizona possesses one of the most efficient offenses in the Pac-10, as it ranks in the top three in the conference in scoring offense, field goal percentage, assists and turnover margin.
LaPlante will have her hands full in the paint against the Wildcats, who boast two senior forwards averaging double-digits points this season in Ify Ibekwe (13.8) and Soana Lucet (11.4).
Ibekwe also leads the Pac-10 in rebounds at 9.8 per game.
“They’re very tough in transition and very athletic,” Corral said. “We have to worry about rebounding and getting back out in transition. It’s going to be a fast game.”
Arizona State has one player who averages double figures in points: senior guard Dymond Simon (13.8).
But the Sun Devils have a lot of depth on their bench with nine players who can come in to contribute.
The Sun Devils also boast a stifling defense — their 52-49 win over Washington last week marked the sixth time this season they have held their opponents under 50 points, something the Women of Troy have only done once this season.
But Corral believes that if they stick to their game plan, the Women of Troy will sweep their games this weekend and take a huge step toward clinching third place in the Pac-10.
That’s an accomplishment that would hold a lot of weight with the NCAA Tournament selection committee come March.
“No matter where we’re playing in the country, they’re just another block in our road, so we have to get through them and do whatever it takes to get a win,” Corral said.

As the waning days of January give way to the feverish conference battles of February, the great teams and those that will be fortunate enough to punch a ticket to the NCAA tournament begin to separate themselves from those on the outside looking in.
Big goals · Still struggling to play consistently, freshman guard Maurice Jones and the rest of the men’s basketball team must prove themselves worthy of the NCAA tournament tonight during their away game against Arizona State. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The USC men’s basketball team hopes to be part of the latter group, and its first chance to make its case for greatness will be against Herb Sendek’s Arizona State Sun Devils for the first test of their season-long three-game road trip.
The team has struggled lately after wins over Texas and Tennessee.
“We were happy to get a few big wins under our belt,” said freshman guard Maurice Jones. “We felt we were kind of good and we just stopped playing the way we should have.”
Of the Trojans’ nine losses this season, seven have been decided by six points or less.
The team’s rally Saturday night against California came up short, when junior guard Jio Fontan’s final three-point attempt at the buzzer missed the mark in the 60-58 home defeat (their fourth loss decided on the final possession of the game).
Questions continue to arise as to whether this group of players can consistently play fundamental basketball for 40 whole minutes.
If ever there were a time to begin to piece together a response to what looks to be a season-long deficiency,  it’s against ASU, who comes into Thursday night’s 6 p.m. matchup in Tempe, Ariz. with just two wins in their last eight games.
“We haven’t played our best basketball, but we pretty much need to get it together and go down there and try to win two,” Fontan told reporters after Tuesday’s practice. “It’s important for us to definitely try to get two.”
For USC (11-9, 3-4) to get the first of two in the desert, defense will once again have to be the focus for USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s squad, as the team is 10-1 this season when holding the opposing team under 40 percent shooting from the field.
Although the Sun Devils (9-11, 1-6) have been underwhelming for the majority of the 2010-2011 season, the team boasts two of the better perimeter shooters in the Pac-10.
Senior guard Ty Abbott averages 13.9 points per game and 41 percent from three-point range and senior forward Rihards Kuksisks averages 9.5 points per game and 39 percent from three-point range.
Perimeter defense has been an issue during USC losses this season, as opposing teams are averaging almost seven hits from three-point range (62 three-point baskets surrendered in nine losses).
Since Arizona State boasts the No. 9 scoring offense in the Pac-10 at 63.5 points per game, stopping veterans like Abbott and Kuksisks from the outside will help USC to steal a Pac-10 road game — something they have yet to do in 2011.
Despite these concerns heading into their three-game road swing, the Trojans insist they’ll be able to solve their ongoing problems.

Amoeba Music served as Sunset Boulevard’s main polestar Tuesday night as a line of music lovers wrapped itself around the store like a boa constrictor to meet Cold War Kids for a live in-store show and signing.
Among the attendants were fans of various backgrounds, from accommodating parents, excited children, cliquish high schoolers, trendy hipsters to collegiate fans.
Rocking out · With a maraca, spontaneous screeching and playful interludes, Cold War Kids exuded a uniquely frenetic vibe at Amoeba. - Ted Gerike | Daily Trojan 
Brought together in the vast space of Amoeba’s music selection, the fans were packed like sardines, between colonnades of CDs and vinyl, to enjoy the release of Cold War Kids’ new album Mine Is Yours.
Cold War Kids was welcomed to the stage by roaring applause, and began its set with “Louder Than Ever.” The song exhibited Cold War Kids’ noted Long Beach vibe and soul-punk blend of sound, highlighted by the thick dual drumming of Matt Aveiro and a guest drummer.
Frontman Nathan Willett added quirks, tweaks and squeaks to his vocals, giving the live presentation of their set a freedom of style and personality not found in the album. During “Audience Of One,” Willett displayed his vocal virtuosity by releasing sharp falsetto howls mixed with spurts of smooth, sentimental phrases.
Front and center, Willett assumed the role of maestro, controlling the group for the entirety of the show. Aveiro and his ephemeral duet partner drummed at the back of the stage together until the guest drummer left, while guitarist Jonnie Russell and bassist Matt Maust rocked, bobbed and spun like symmetrical tops on either side of their conductor.
Cold War Kids had an exciting stage presence from start to finish, and songs like “Royal Blue” elicited hoots of ecstasy from the audience. In “Royal Blue,” Aveiro’s gentle drumming mixed with the jazzy beach ambiance of Maust’s and Russell’s instruments. The song got the crowd going before Russell’s dissonant solo made everyone really let loose.
The audience’s applause interrupted every song, and it was this audience interaction that made Amoeba an exciting venue in which to watch the show despite its small size.
Cold War Kids bridged the gaps between its set with weird jamming interludes that kept the audience guessing which song would be played next.
At one point, Willett hacked at the microphone, Aveiro grabbed a maraca and the other musicians began a thunderous, malevolent jam that segued into “Cold Toes On The Cold Floor.” Evil-sounding riffs, slow chord progressions and Willett’s vocal masking highlighted this new song that seemed to deviate from the typical musical flavors of Cold War Kids’ records.
The band thanked its listeners profusely for coming out and supporting them, and stated that their new album is a bit of an experiment. It is the most labor-intensive work they have put out, as evidenced by a few of their new songs.
One such new track, “Sensitive Kid,” bounced to and fro between vibes and styles as Willett alternated between his idiosyncratic, pseudo-yelling vocals, bleakly expressive singing and slow, paced-out scatting. The other musicians worked in collusion to send the spectators through a pulsing world of sound to a sparkly, tinkling destination.
Willett proceeded to impress and rouse the audience as he amped up his keys for their new song “Bulldozer.” He sang with falsetto jerks while showing off his multi-faceted talents with piano chords and arpeggios. “Bulldozer” contains a teasing pause in the middle of the song that soothes like a lullaby before quickly relapsing back into the eponymous character of the song.
After another “Thank you,” Willett slammed his hands on his keyboard to start the finale of the band’s set, “We Used To Vacation.” All of Amoeba bobbed, swayed and smacked its hands, almost in synergy.
Willett’s piano parts screeched throughout Amoeba like skidding cars, while Maust, Russell and Aveiro thrashed their instruments. The concert came to a chaotic close as their ferocious sounds meshed to form one destructive onslaught of reverb and noise.
The melting pot of Cold War Kids fans filtered through Amoeba’s aisles applauding the quartet’s performance and newest creation.

We live in a post-burger world.
The humble burger is not just a humble burger anymore. It’s a statement, a blank canvas, a form of nostalgia and an American comfort food.
Classic and innovative ideas bump shoulders constantly in Los Angeles, and burgers are no exception.
Burger bar · The burger variations at Go Burger include everything from the “UltiMelt,” made with a couple of grilled sandwiches as a bun, to the “Smashed Burger” which is literally “hand smashed” and comes with onions. - Cory Sanford | Daily Trojan 
There’s In-N-Out, and the always popular Tommy’s. Umami Burger serves up a fascinating gourmet version, as do Bouchon, Lazy Ox Canteen and Wolfgang Puck.
Might as well add Go Burger to the list.
Newly opened in Hollywood, Go Burger is the BLT Restaurant Group’s new venture into the world of Los Angeles burger joints.
It features various gourmet burgers with an endless selection of toppings, as well as a weekly special. Also available are hot dogs and a few other entrees.
Additionally, Go Burger boasts a delicious drink menu, full of combinations that read like the  work of a rebellious 16-year-old.
The menu presents spiked milkshakes with ice cream, liqueurs and hard booze, as well as “adult floats” with, you guessed it, more ice cream and hard booze. This is accompanied by a long list of beers from the bottle and on tap, a few house cocktails and even beer cocktails.
Go Burger is virtually a mosh pit at 8:30 p.m. on a Friday night, with dozens milling around the host’s stand hoping for an open table. Thankfully, the wait this Friday was made bearable by SportsCenter and the Lakers on Go Burger’s numerous large, flat-panel TVs.
The ambiance blended diverse elements, modern and luxurious with dark woods and lowered lights, but also raucous and trendy with crowd noise and throwback elements like simple tables and steel chairs.
Still, few care about ambiance when burgers are on the brain. And Go Burger certainly doesn’t disappoint in this respect. The menu lists a few “Signature” burgers, including the violent-sounding “Smashed Burger” which comes “hand smashed” and “studded with onions.”
It is ferociously delicious, particularly when done “Philly style” with griddled onions, peppers, pickled jalapeños and provolone cheese.
And who could resist the “UltiMelt,” a grotesquely seductive concoction of fat, meaty beef plopped between — wait for it — two grilled cheese sandwiches? Granted, they are extremely slender grilled cheeses that are really just a sprinkling of cheese between two shavings of tasty rye bread, but the idea is still mouth-watering. The UltiMelt is undeniably rich, but not the heart-stopping monster that the menu implies.
Other burgers run the predictable-but-still-delicious gamut of topping combinations. The “Great Hills Blue” is a standout, with a salty-creamy-sweet mix of Great Hills blue cheese and caramelized onions.
There is also a “BLT,” a “Prime” burger made with dry-aged cuts of meat and the de rigueur “Classic,” all served on toasty if somewhat generic burger buns.
But the meal also had its low points. The “Kobe Dog,” made with a Snake River Farms frankfurter, is surprisingly average. If grilled or griddled it could have been better. Instead, this dog feels boiled, with a mildly chewy skin.
It could’ve gone head-to-head with a Hebrew National and earned a draw. In any event, the Kobe Dog is certainly not worth $7.
The duck fat fries, which are stunningly crisp and aromatic, came in a notably paltry portion for $6 a pop.
But should you still get them? Absolutely. Everything is better fried in duck fat, especially potatoes.
One can only push the burger envelope so far, and Go Burger doesn’t tread many mysterious culinary waters with its options (save for perhaps the UltiMelt).
But although Go Burger might lack the sheer innovation and precision of, say, Umami Burger, it offers flat-out satisfying burgers that don’t disappoint.
Sometimes that’s exactly what you need.

Why is Taco Bell’s food so cheap? Because its meat filling is only 36 percent beef and full of oat products!
That’s not a joke.
The Alabama law firm Beasley Allen P.C. is pursuing a class-action lawsuit against Taco Bell for falsely advertising its “beef” filling as beef when, according to the firm, it’s mostly fillers and random flavorings — most notably, “isolated oat product” and oats.
Although there’s always been the running gag about mysterious fast-food meat products, I doubt anyone would have guessed that the meat in their Taco Bell burrito was only one-third real meat.
The content of Taco Bell's meat has long been questioned. | Creative Commons
If the accusation is true, Taco Bell’s filling, by USDA standards, can’t be called “beef.”
In fact, it can’t even be called “meat taco filling,” which is the label used by the USDA for taco fillings that contain at least 40 percent fresh meat.
Unbelievably, Taco Bell fails to meet this very, very low bar.
But why would Taco Bell do such a thing? Why would it take a nice pile of ground beef and thin it out with water, oats and beef flavoring? What purpose does that serve?
When it comes to corporate food manipulation, the answer is simple — profit.
Of course, Taco Bell could use more fresh meat in its filling, perhaps raising the price of a foodstuff from 80 cents to — gasp! — a dollar. But why would they do that?
It’s worked out perfectly fine for them to ride on the backs of their customers’ sheer apathy about what goes into the food they chow down.
And until now, it’s been a lot like “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” Except maybe in this case, it would be “don’t ask, and we won’t ever mention that our meat isn’t all that much meat — but hey, thanks for paying more than you should be.”
Granted, the latter doesn’t roll off the tongue as well, but we’ll get that ironed out.
In any event, the president of Taco Bell, Greg Creed, got all worked up, releasing a press statement. Creed notes that the company starts with “100 percent USDA-inspected beef,” and that it is proud of the quality of its beef, identifying all seasonings and spices on the Taco Bell website.
“Unfortunately, the lawyers in this case elected to sue first and ask questions later — and got their ‘facts’ absolutely wrong,” Creed said. “We plan to take legal action for the false statements being made about our food.”
It’s hard to know whether or not the claims about Taco Bell’s meat filling are true. But it is important to note that the lawsuit does not ask for money, but a correction.
And it’s hard to believe that a law firm would dive into a pricey, time-consuming lawsuit without getting their research straight.
It’s even more unthinkable than the idea that Taco Bell’s meat isn’t mostly meat.
There’s nothing inherently wrong with Taco Bell’s filling. True, it’s kind of a grotesque, Frankensteinian creation, but meat and oats with flavoring doesn’t seem too egregious. And God knows that the morning after a regrettable night of drinking, most people will be craving a sour-cream spurting taco with lots of Fire sauce.
The problem here is that if the claims are true, Taco Bell has been flaunting food service legalities to prevent its customers from dealing with unappetizing descriptions of its food.
What sounds better to you, “a crunchy, corn taco shell filled with seasoned ground beef,” or “a crunchy, corn taco shell filled with meat taco filling?”
The bottom line is that if fast- food corporations want to serve their customers dirt-cheap food of questionable quality, they should be forthcoming about their ingredients.
A white lie, at day’s end,  is still a lie.
And it’s our job as consumers to demand the best that can be reasonably offered.
No one’s asking Taco Bell to hire Gordon Ramsay to redo its menu, but is it all that much to ask that we be told the truth once in a while?
Although there might not be anything wrong with tacos full of oat-meat, there is something surreptitious about passing them off as a higher grade product.
Thankfully, Beasley Allen P.C. is willing to ask the question that many of us simply never consider: What the heck are we eating?

Mr Kim: i know facebook has taught you that the “new age of sarcasm” is cool, but this isn’t facebook. less “edgy, sassy, preachy” sentences. affirm your opinions elsewhere. this is about taco bell, not about you
Did the lawyers do correct sampling? Its suppose to be based on the squareroot of N plus one.  That is, 100 stores, sample eleven, 400 meals, sample 21.  If this trend shows up in most of their stores and in the individual samplings, then its valid.  Also, I predict any real deviations found will be blamed on the cooks, not the stuff that came in the back door.  It may represent a form of cheating to increase profits if they are using just half the beef required.
Not even the tiniest mention of Taco Bell’s side of the story or the possibility that the claim by the law firm could be untrue? The law firm, of course, states all of their opinions as fact; this is, after all, how they hope to win their case. But you, as a a journalist, should be more discerning in what you present to your readers. At least allow for the possibility that the law firm’s claims may not be completely accurate…

A remake of the 1972 movie of the same name, The Mechanic is the tale of Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham), an elite hitman, who picks up an apprentice, Steve McKenna (Ben Foster), out of guilt for assassinating the unstable young man’s father.
Renee Cohn | Daily Trojan
As usual, Statham plays Statham. The actor has now repeated the same role so many times that what was once a unique spin on the clichéd Cockney tough guy is now about as compelling as the trailer for Mars Needs Moms.
Yet the man deserves some credit. Statham performed all of his own stunts in the film and the risks pay off.
With Statham’s determined face clearly visible throughout the action, what would otherwise be relatively unremarkable for today’s cinema becomes more engaging and personal. It’s a shame the energy couldn’t be converted into a more complex performance from the star.
The Mechanic’s decision to glorify silent, subtle assassination along the lines of what a real hitman might do, as opposed to the outright bombastic action of most similarly marketed action films proves somewhat successful.
It comes as little surprise that the film has been more than 15 years in the making, with hundreds of pitched scripts. Unfortunately, 15 years later, the remake still does not quite hit the mark.
According to director Simon West and screenwriter Richard Wenk, the main difference between the original version and the remake lies in the development of Foster’s character.
Instead of merely being Bishop’s apprentice, McKenna becomes a catalyst for the story’s developments and his relationship with the teacher serves as the film’s primary emotional draw.
The son of a known assassin exposed all his life to the culture of hitmen, McKenna becomes consumed and deranged by his desire to enter their world, a thirst complicated by his desire to avenge his father’s death.
As McKenna, Foster excels, frequently overshadowing Statham. Foster is showing his versatility as a young Hollywood actor, having successfully portrayed disturbed characters in movies such as 3:10 to Yuma and Alpha Dog, along with a comedic, yet still deranged, appearance on NBC’s My Name is Earl.
The producers and casting directors of The Mechanic had their eyes on the young actor as soon as the opportunity arose. Foster claims to have taken on the film as a light side project yet, ironically, it is his talent alone that makes The Mechanic into something more.
You’ll come for Statham, but you’ll leave thinking Foster might just be the next great action hero.
All things considered, this  should have been a good film. The plot is interesting, the focus on the intimate life of a hitman is captivating at times and Foster’s performance is revelatory.
But as executed by West and Wenk, the sum of the film is substantially less than its parts. The dialogue is trite, as per typical action movie fare.
Wenk unadvisedly centers the film on a plot arc less stirring than what he and West had.
The film is no longer about assassination and the training of a young hitman, but instead is dominated by the digital explosions and action sequences that moviegoers have seen hundreds of times before.
Those who watch The Mechanic expecting an action picture with a twist will find gratification in the first forty minutes or so. Those seeking a rawer, more thoroughly dynamic action picture can find better elsewhere.

Tomorrow is the last day to drop or add classes. It is not, however, the last day to return unwanted textbooks to USC’s bookstore — that was one week ago.
This means that in the last  seven days, students could have added a class, purchased books for said class and then dropped the class, leaving them out some hundreds of dollars for nonrefundable textbooks.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Unfortunately for the enraged masses of students — and there are many — who feel the bookstore tricked them into buying exorbitantly overpriced textbooks and then forced them to shove Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades into the closet when they realized MUSC 499 wasn’t a major requirement, the bookstore actually has a reason for this policy.
USC students love to complain about (often legitimate) instances of the university ripping off its students. ($18.95 for a paperback that can be read in three and a half trips to the bathroom? $5 for hummus?)
But institutional machinations aren’t always so black and white. Case in point: The bookstore is not trying to steal our money.
Not that it doesn’t need it. As with many university bookstores in the country, textbook sales at USC’s Pertusati Bookstore are suffering because of online competitors.
Of course, the downside of shopping online is waiting for the merchandise to come; that’s where the bookstore’s policy comes into play.
Bookstore manager Raymond McDermott pointed out that many students try to game the system, at cost to the university.
“We had too many people abusing the system — buying books and then ordering from someplace else and then returning them, which then creates artificial shortages for students here who want to purchase them, and it was increasing our cost,” McDermott said. “That’s why we have the one week with receipt [refund policy].”
It’s hard to begrudge what is clearly the underdog in the college textbook arena, but the bookstore’s policy still technically precludes the honest section of the student body — those who dropped a class and need to unload unnecessary purchases.
But McDermott said there is often wiggle room for students who can prove they dropped a class.
“We make exceptions to the refund policy after [the refund date] for people who dropped,” he said. “Because, after the first week really, the only reason why you should be returning a book is if you dropped a class in the first place.”
And yet, every year, students gripe about an unfair policy.
The first step the bookstore can take in clearing its name is making its exceptions to the rule better known to students when they buy their books — something McDermott said he is considering implementing for next semester.
He said a reworded policy would clarify that if students drop a class, “they can still do a refund, with proof that they dropped the class and their register receipt, until the last day of drop and add.”
In a time when the bookstore has been hit as hard economically as its students, we’re not going to see lowered prices, and USC is not the only university grappling with how to deal with the encroaching menace of online options.
Hopefully with a better delineated policy, students can take advantage of the option to return their books up until registration closes. What students face, McDermott said, “is an industry trend. Something that regrettably stores have to do to survive.”

President Barack Obama faced a daunting challenge as he took the podium in front of a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening for his second State of the Union address.

Despite all of his campaign references to a spirit of bipartisanship, the American political arena has become increasingly more divisive in the first years of Obama’s presidency.
In the 2010 midterm elections, the Republican Party gained control of the House of Representatives and made significant gains in the Senate.
With Democrats still reeling from the midterm elections, Obama insisted on bipartisan cooperation, although he did not attempt to fix his image with voters and he did not back down from challenging the GOP on certain issues. Instead, he decided to keep a careful eye turned toward the future.
The president’s glowing rhetoric shone through at the start of his speech as he recognized Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who is recovering from an apparent assassination attempt. Obama urged Congress to learn from the tragedy.
“Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater — something more consequential than party or political preference,” he said.
From there, Obama began to paint a picture of his plans for the future of an America that the eternal idealist sees as “poised for progress.”
He explained that for Americans, progress is more than just improving stock values or a growing economy. It’s the personal progress of attaining dreams and securing the opportunity for a better life.
Obama’s rhetoric carried a darker tone than his campaign speeches of 2008. He once again evoked the idea of “change,” only this time in reference to a shift away from a time when jobs were more readily accessible to Americans.
“That world has changed,” he said. “And for many, the change has been painful. I’ve seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories, and the vacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets.”
With such worries haunting the minds of many Americans, Obama struck a comfortable balance between reassuring the public about the current situation and providing hope for the future.
He reminded his audience that the United States still has the world’s largest economy and best colleges and universities.
At times, though, his attempts at re-energizing the American public did came across as forced and overly patriotic.
“We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world,” he declared,  to raucous applause.
His statements sometimes felt too much like a pep talk, more fitting in a rally than in a State of the Union Address.
His message, however, could not have been more relevant to Americans.
Obama took some of his strongest stands against the Republicans on the topics of immigration and health care reform.
Although he never explicity mentioned the DREAM Act, which failed to pass in December and would have given illegal aliens who graduated from U.S. high schools the opportunity to earn conditional permanent residency, he stressed the need for protecting our borders while still retaining and developing people like foreign students or children of undocumented immigrants.
“And let’s stop expelling talented, responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs, or starting a new business, who could be further enriching this nation,” he said.
Obama also addressed his new policies that have taken shape in the past years.
With regard to his health care reform act, Obama said he would be eager to work with Congress on improving the bill, but he rightfully took a firm defense for the reforms of insurance company practices.
In the later stages of his address, however, Obama’s argument seemed to weaken.
He attempted to prove to his audience that he could control spending by proposing a freeze on annual domestic spending for the next five years, but he did little to explain how that would be reconciled with his plans for an improved American infrastructure and education system.
For what it was, though, Obama delivered a solid speech, as did Rep. Paul Ryan, who gave the official Republican response.
Ryan smartly avoided being too confrontational, even saying that “no one person or party is responsible” for the national debt.
Through Obama’s speech and Ryan’s response, Congress demonstrated that the tide is slowly turning toward a more bipartisan government.

Known for their well-made videosong mashup creations on Youtube, USC alum Alex Pfender and high school friend Noah Dietterich have made quite a name for themselves on the web as the folktronic duo yOya.
Recently, they’ve come out with their own a album “Nothing to Die.” The duo eclectically combined the classic folk sound with the contemporary electronic sound to create adistinct and original sound (think MGMT mixed with Bon Iver).
Juggling acoustic guitars, drum sequencers, shakers, synths, keyboards, common household items and whatever they can get their hands on, the two create catchy tunes matched with witty lyrics.
Using modern technology, what once was necessary for a full band is now easily tackled by just two people. Their brilliantly arranged upbeat yet heavy hits make great songs to bob your head to in your car while their slower ballads have the ability to draw out raw emotion.
Since the release of their album last year, they’ve shared a stage with bands such as The 88, Moving Picture Show and Avi Buffalo. Still a very young project, they’re definitely on the right path to success.
My Top Picks: “Fireworks,” “Lovers On” and “New Years Morning.”
yOya have performed many times for KXSC here on campus. They are excellent live and I always live to hear about them knowing that I’ve met them and they are fantastic people.

There’s nothing more important than finding your voice as a writer. Or so we’re told. Roger Ebert, one of the most prolific writers working today, lost his voice four years ago after a battle with thyroid cancer.
Roger Ebert | Creative Commons
Ebert has been writing more than ever, and has shown no signs of slowing down, even through all the difficult times he has endured. So, it’s no surprise that he has also relaunched his television program, now called Ebert Presents: At the Movies.
In this modernized edition, the focus is still on reviews of films currently in theatrical release, with hosts Christy Lemire of The Associated Press and Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of Mubi.com.  The original series dates back to over a quarter of a century ago, when Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert first took their seats in the balcony.
The chemistry between Siskel and Ebert was always palpable and the world was introduced to two sharp, intellectual critics who brought respectful film reviews to their audience. The humorous arguments and often dissimilar viewpoints between the hosts was nothing less than entertaining. The series was an immediate success.
The program, however, endured difficult times when Gene Siskel was hospitalized for a brain tumor in 1998, and eventually passed away in 1999. There were numerous guest hosts, until Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times took over the empty seat.
The series was plagued with continuous bad luck as Roger Ebert was eventually diagnosed with thyroid cancer and had sections of his jaw removed. The program struggled from there on, never finding a balance with its frequent guest hosts, and quickly went from an intellectual discussion with respectable critics to brief introductions with questionable reviewers.
Ebert’s plan has long been to return to the roots of the original program. That’s essentially the structure we have with the new series, along with an opening sequence that’s heartwarming and nostalgic. The sequence begins with old photographs of Siskel and Ebert, two irreplaceable hosts, and moves into the present day.
Christy Lemire and Ignatiy Vishnevetsky opened the series reviewing films such  as No Strings Attached and The Company Men. The episode was filled with opposing viewpoints, with Lemire giving a thumbs down on every film, and Vishnevetsky giving a thumbs up.
There are several surprise additions in this updated version, including special segments on classic films, along with two contributing film critics, Kim Morgan and Omar Moore. There’s also a segment called “Roger’s Office” in which Ebert himself will review hidden gems and overlooked films, using the assistance of his computer generated voice. In the first episode, Roger Ebert reviewed the animated film My Dog Tulip, whereas Kim Morgan introduced audiences to the classic film noir, The Third Man.
Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, who is only 24-years-old, clearly knows his cinema history, but tries to justify his opinions when reviewing mediocre films. There’s a clear passion and drive in his speech, but his thumbs up rating of Season of the Witch, for instance, is unquestionably alarming. Christy Lemire, on the other hand, is much more experienced and judgmental, reminding us of what constitutes a good film critic.
 
Ebert Presents at the Movies cannot compete the original, and nobody can ever replace the two film critics we fell in love with. The series, however, is a fresh and innovative approach, and is much better than the mess it was several years ago. The discussions between the young critics are lively and entertaining, even if they will never replace Siskel and Ebert.
Roger Ebert is still speaking to his audience, and he’s willing to do so with or without a voice.
I was glad as well as surprised  to read that Roger Ebert is bringing back the show. It is not every critic that is a great critic and although he is not going to be the one in the “balcony” I am hoping that his leadership can influence the new hosts to provide viewers with an interesting show and honest reviews. Thanks for the great article!

At Sundance 2011, the motto on every attendee’s mind is “Be Here.” That’s the mindset of the USC School of Cinematic Arts and its alumni filmmakers and students who will make their annual presence  at Park City, Utah, for the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and Slamdance Festival from Jan. 20th to the 30th.
For the past four years and fifth consecutive event, the SCA has sponsored a USC filmmaker’s breakfast to celebrate the accomplishments of student filmmakers and allow them a chance to mingle.
“So often with the festival, you’re so focused on your particular project,” Senior Director of SCA Alumni Relations Justin Wilson said. “You don’t often get a chance to meet your fellow filmmakers in a relaxed setting.”
A palpable sense of anticipation courses through the gathering of USC filmmaking alumni mirroring the general atmosphere of the 2011 Sundance Film Festival at large.
“I’ve been coming to Sundance for seven years in a row.  It only gets better each time,” Restless City producer Katie Mustard said.  “You know you’re going to see old friends, meet new people and attend great films and parties.  I look forward to these USC events all the time.”
Melissa Lee, Class of 2007 in Peter Stark Producing, similarly reveled in this excitement with her film Circumstance, a story about teenagers dealing with the struggles of love and sexuality.
“You’re not sure what to really expect.  This is my first Sundance,” Lee said.  “It’s our world premiere, so you never know how the audience will react.  The screening went better than expected.”
Not only was the filmmakers’ breakfast originally organized to bring the USC filmmakers together in a relaxed setting, but it is also a way for the SCA dean to congratulate the successful filmmakers for getting their projects to such prestigious festivals.
Originally, the SCA envisioned an annual USC Sundance Cocktail Festival Party on a Monday night, hoping to get the filmmakers together for networking. Unfortunately, most USC filmmakers left Tuesday morning, leaving little time for introductions.  Consequently, the SCA created the USC Filmmakers’ Breakfast to be scheduled on a Monday morning and set the Cocktail Festival Party for a Tuesday night.
“When the Sundance and Slamdance lineups get announced, we ask our cinema alum to contact us if their films made the festivals,” Director of Student Industry Relations Bonnie Chi said.  “Once we finalize the details, such as venue and date, we send out an email invite to all those filmmakers.  They could also contact us through our First Look event.”
Considering that 43 USC alumni films made it into both 2011 festivals, there was a strong sense of Trojan pride among the 33 filmmakers attending the breakfast.  Nicola Marsh, Class of 2006, has her film Troubadours in the Sundance festival.
“It’s super to connect to people who make films and you know them through the USC Film School.  You first see them as students and now as professionals,” Marsh said.  “When your film makes it into Sundance, you’re a legitimate filmmaker.  It makes you feel really good.  I’m at Sundance!”
For Sundance and Slamdance 2011, the USC Filmmakers’ Breakfast was held at Flanigan’s, a restaurant bar co-owned by a USC Alumnus.  Flanigan’s offered an intimate setting for USC Filmmaking Trojans to gather among cinema Trojans, share success stories and network over a breakfast.
“USC Cinema is a recognizable brand and people expect quality filmmaking,” Wilson said.  “Year after year our alums deliver just that.”

USC seniors, wide receiver Ronald Johnson, center Kristofer O’Dowd and cornerback Shareece Wright, are scheduled to play in Saturday’s Senior Bowl, the annual all-star game pitting the nation’s best senior college football players and top NFL draft prospects on teams representing the North and South regions.
The Trojan trio leaves USC after embarking on careers that saw multiple Rose Bowl victories and various mentions on conference All-American teams. O’Dowd started 36 games in four years for both Pete Carroll and Lane Kiffin, while Johnson had his most productive season in 2010, totaling 64 receptions for 692 yards and eight touchdowns.
Wright, who was academically ineligible for the 2009 season, did not have an interception in 2010, but did recover two fumbles and had a blocked field goals, while starting alongside freshman Nickell Robey
The event is scheduled to kick off at 1 p.m. PST and will be televised on the NFL Network.
