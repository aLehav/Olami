Although he is deeply embroiled in a fair use lawsuit with the Associated Press, politically-charged artist and graphic designer Shepard Fairey followed through with his scheduled Visions and Voices event Wednesday night, speaking to an overbooked Annenberg Auditorium about his role in art, culture and politics.
Most recognizable for his widely circulated Obama “Hope” posters during last year’s campaign season (the original photo from which the iconic image was created is at the center of his AP court case), Fairey’s work has always set out to blur the lines between politics and art.
After his infamous “Andre the Giant has a posse” stickers—which started spontaneously as an inside joke between skateboarding friends in 1989—garnered the attention of local media, Fairey became fascinated by the ability to incite a response through placing unfamiliar images in public space.
“This happy accident ended up becoming an obsession for me,” he told the crowd. “The more stickers that are out there, the more important it seems. The more important it seems, the more people want to know and then you’ve built something from nothing.”
So, grounding his interests in both the Sex Pistol’s conception of situationism (“people have become numb through repetition an they need unexpected spectacles to give them new perspective”) and Heidegger’s theory of phenomenology (“there are things that are unique that can reawaken one’s sense of wonder about their environment”), Fairey created a space where his “happy accident” could evolve into something more meaningful.
Naming his company Obey after an image repeated in an anti-capitalist B-movie, Fairey mass produced a line of posters, stickers and stencils that through hand exchange ended up on walls, overpasses and street signs worldwide.
“People follow the path of least resistance and are obedient just not to rock the boat. But when they’re confronted with the direct command to obey, it’s very unsettling,” Fairey said. “I am exposing it to inspire action.”
Throughout the conversation—which was lead by professor of American studies and ethnicity Sarah Banet-Weiser—Fairey scrolled through a slideshow of his works and spoke candidly about many of the pieces, even those (such as one portraying George W. Bush as a vampire) that might be viewed as immature.
“It’s a bit juvenile, I’ll admit, but that can be cathartic when you’re depressed about what’s going on,” Fairey said.
After eight years of frustration with the Bush administration, Fairey channeled his anger into support for Barack Obama during the 2008 elections. And although his very vocal endorsements for the former Illinois governor might have seemed overzealous, Fairey acknowledges that Obama is not the cure-all that the “Hope” posters idealized.
“He’s just a foot in the door—a step in the right direction,” Fairey said.
But a presidential victory is not enough to quell Fairey’s overtly propaganda designs and some of his recent works focus on issues such as stopping global warming and creating immigration reform.
“I’m still disappointed in us,” Fairey said. “Idiots are controlling the conversation. Glenn Beck has an audience and that makes me want to kill myself.”
When the floor finally opened for questions from the audience, a student wearing an Obey Giant T-shirt stood at the microphone and noted that Fairey recently complicated his ongoing lawsuit with the AP by admitting to lying about which photo he used for the “Hope” poster. The student’s question created palpable tension in the room: “What was your motivation behind not giving the truth initially?”
Without hesitation or insincerity, Fairey admitted to the wrongdoing.
“It’s going to be something I regret for the rest of my life,” Fairey said. “I did something dastardly that I shouldn’t have done. I’m an honest person and it was a very difficult confluence of circumstances that led me to make a very bad decision.”
He then explained the historical context of fair use laws (which he claims are on his side regardless of which photo he used) and was starting to describe other technicalities when his wife, Amanda, interrupted him from the front row.
“Wrap it up,” she said.
Then, in a moment of spontaneity similar to the one that created his initial Andre the Giant stickers, Fairey responded to his wife’s concerns.
“It’s okay,” Fairey said. “These principles are available online. You can go on Google like I did to get the image.”

As phases of USC’s Master Plan approach finalization, many students remain concerned about how the proposed renovations to the University Village will address their retail needs without negatively impacting the surrounding community.
Students had the chance to voice their concerns Thursday night at the USC Master Plan Forum, hosted by the Undergraduate Student Government’s Community Affairs department. The forum featured a presentation from the university officials involved with the Master Plan, who answered students’ questions on issues related to the changes to University Village changes.
Kristina Raspe, associate senior vice president of real estate and asset management for USC, and Brian League, director of entitlements for Capital Construction Development, focused their presentation on District 3 of the Master Plan, which includes the University Village and the Cardinal Gardens and Century housing complexes.
“The students who are coming [to USC] want to engage in the campus on a 24-hour basis,” Raspe said. “District 3 provides us with our greatest opportunity to make this a residential university, to build high-quality, affordable housing for students. We own virtually all of it, so we can control what goes on there.”
The Master Plan calls for the construction of mixed-use buildings in the University Village, with retailers and restaurants on the ground floor and student housing on the upper floors. The project will provide an additional 5,200 beds for students. A fitness center, hotel, movie theater, bookstore and intramural fields will also appear in District 3.
This phase of the Master Plan is projected to reach completion in 2014, with construction anticipated to begin in 2012, League said.
About 50 students attended Thursday night’s forum, and many were interested in learning about the specific retailers that would come to the revamped University Village.
Although USC is still several years away from settling on contracts with specific retailers, officials plan to continue the relationship with many current University Village retailers and to consider students’ and community members’ needs when searching for new retailers, Raspe said.
“We have identified more than enough retailers that meet both needs. There are surprisingly a lot of crossovers,” she said. “At this point we’re not making any decisions. We’re testing the market. As we get closer to the time period when we can actually look at retailers, we will be looking for feedback from students and the community.”
Raspe added that Superior Grocers had decided not to temporarily relocate to University Gateway while the new University Village is being constructed, which could potentially leave Ralphs as the only nearby grocery store for students during that period.
Some students were concerned about the effects the changes would have on residents of the surrounding community, who have criticized USC as more and more students have begun to live in the area.
But Raspe said the plans for District 3 provide USC students with more university-operated housing options to prevent them from having to unnecessarily encroach on the surrounding neighborhood.
“I don’t believe that this project creates gentrification. Our goal is to make affordable housing for our students so we can increase the housing stock for the community at large,” she said.
Many students, like Veronica Gregg, a junior majoring in public policy, management and planning, said they found the information in the presentation valuable, but hoped they would have more chances to give suggestions and provide feedback regarding the Master Plan.
“This is really interesting to me because it’s a project where the university can get students involved,” Gregg said. “But because they’re not that far along, they can’t tell how involved we’ll be.”
Raspe said she and other Master Plan officials want to keep students informed, but because the approval process for the project is still taking place, updates come slowly.
“We’re happy to meet with the student groups as often as they want,” she said. “We need all the stakeholders’ feedback. We can come out monthly, but the problem is things don’t happen monthly.”
USG has hosted similar events in the past and held Thursday night’s forum to further increase student knowledge about and involvement in the Master Plan, according to Victoria Chernova, USG’s director of community affairs.
“We wanted to [hold this forum] to make sure there’s no speculation or rumors about what’s going on with the Master Plan and to give students a chance to get involved because there will be a time when student involvement is key to getting [the Master Plan] passed by the city,” Chernova said.
Although the forum’s attendance was not as high as USG would have liked, Chernova said she was glad the students who attended were genuinely interested, and she hopes the rest of the student community will become just as concerned about the Master Plan. More forums and discussions with student organizations are planned for the spring semester, she added.
“Because we’re going to be alumni of the university, its future is very important to us regardless of whether we’re going to be here,” Chernova said. “It is really early to give [Master Plan officials] our feedback, but we need to make people aware of the issue so that when that time comes, it’ll be easier to mobilize them.”

A recently awarded grant from the US Department of Commerce will help a USC program expand its research on how to assist the economic development of local manufacturing companies, with the aim of creating jobs for both community members and USC students.
The two-year, $750,000 grant, given by the DoC’s Economic Development Administration, will allow the USC Center for Economic Development to research how to pair local businesses so they use each others’ waste and byproducts as fuel.
The research is based on the idea that one company can benefit from the products another company produces as waste, CED Program Director Deepak Bahl said. The research will focus on creating “equal industry parks” that help these companies share energy streams and byproducts, such as water or steam, to create new products.
“[We hope to] identify projects that could be developed and lead to the establishment of equal industry parks that create jobs,” Bahl said. “This will lead to better resource recovery and materials recycling and remanufacturing.”
The center, which is housed in the School of Policy, Planning and Development, will focus on businesses in a 21-county area of Southern California. The center hopes to provide technical assistance, applied research and information dissemination for the companies, through working with the local governments and non-profits.
“We hope to add some long-term impact on the manufacturing process thus increasing the number of people who work in the area in manufacturing — but that’s not a short-term goal,” said Leonard Mitchell, the executive director of the CED and professor at SPPD.
The project will not only provide jobs in the community but also part-time jobs to graduate and undergraduate students. These jobs will be offered mainly within SPPD, but the center will branch out to other schools, such as the Viterbi School of Engineering.
“Students are an integral part of the center’s activities,” Bahl said. “They are involved working hands-on on the project.”
Bahl said some student responsibilities include market analysis, feasibility studies, identification of  potential tenants for the industrial park and outreach to local governments.
Joseph Marcos a graduate student studying policy, planning and development who is involved with the center, said the center’s work would help create a manufacturing base in Southern California.
“At the manufacturing and industrial level there are so many opportunities to create an immense amount of jobs in economic development,” Marcos said. “There’s a really a space for everybody in implementing green techniques.”
Although this grant will only provide two years of funding, Bahl added that they were hoping the research’s success would jumpstart the center’s other initiatives, such as transit-oriented studies and comprehensive economic development strategies for troubled communities.
“We are considering this a seed grant that we are able to expand into broader activities,” Bahl said.
