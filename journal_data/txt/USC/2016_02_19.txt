The USC women’s basketball team fell 76-52 to No. 7 Oregon State Friday night in Corvallis, Ore. as the Beavers used a combination of great defense and hot shooting to defeat the Trojans.
USC (18-9, 6-9) was unable to muster up much offense against a tough defensive frontcourt anchored by senior Ruth Hamblin.
Pac-12 leader Oregon State (23-3, 14-1) came into today as one of the best defensive teams in the country and the Beavers lived up to their reputation tonight, limiting the Women of Troy to 17-of-63 shooting and forcing 11 turnovers.
Hamblin, Oregon State’s career leader in blocks, wrecked havoc defensively for the Beavers. As she has all season, Hamblin protected the rim valiantly and limited USC’s ability to score inside, finishing with five blocks and 13 rebounds.
“Ruth Hamblin is one of the premier defensive players in the country,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “She contested every shot that was in the paint.”
Freshman guard Aliyah Mazyck was one of the few bright spots for the Trojans, finishing with 17 points.
The frontcourt duo of senior Temi Fagbenle and sophomore Kristen Simon struggled throughout the game, combining for 10 points on 3-of-21 shooting.
Oregon State came out of the half on fire, jumping out to an 8-0 run and extending its six-point halftime lead to 37-23. The Beavers moved the ball effectively, leading to open jumpers and easy layups. USC struggled to score with Hamblin protecting the rim valiantly, stifling the Women of Troy’s ability to attack the rim. Oregon State was unstoppable in the third quarter, hitting multiple jumpers, and outscoring USC 27-12.
In a fourth quarter that was not competitive, the Women of Troy were unable to cut into the lead with the Beavers continuing their hot shooting into the fourth quarter. The Beavers extended the lead to a game-high 27 on a 3-pointer by Taylor Kalmer with two minutes remaining in the fourth quarter.
The Trojans struggled offensively to start the game but they were able to keep things close with their aggressive defense and relentless hustle. After trailing throughout the first quarter, the Women of Troy were able to tie the game with two minutes remaining in the quarter on a tough layup by Sadie Edwards. It was an ugly first quarter with both teams shooting below 30 percent and finishing with a meager nine points.
The action picked up in the second quarter with both teams shooting the ball much better. USC took its first and only lead of the game on its first possession of the second quarter on a put-back by Fagbenle. But the Beavers quickly responded with an 8-0 run, including back-to-back 3-pointers by senior Deven Hunger and freshman Taylor Kalmer to take a 17-13 lead. The Women of Troy were unable to muster up a run of their own and finished the half trailing 29-23.
It was a tough game for the Women of Troy as they suffered their largest loss of the season. The team not only had trouble on offense but they also struggled on the defensive end as Oregon State’s ball movement left USC scrambling.
“We’ve got to get back to our basics of playing defense and running,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We’ve got to be able to execute our game-plan for 40 minutes.”
USC next heads to Eugene to play a Ducks team coming off a loss to No. 12 UCLA.

Just this week, Obama and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) met for a two-day summit in Sunnylands to address the increased tensions within the South China Sea. While not directly mentioned in their joint statement in efforts to be diplomatic, the main source of the problem is China’s growing security threat in the Asia-Pacific region. The leaders of the US-ASEAN summit claimed that the meeting had positive outcomes, but it is highly unlikely that the deeply rooted problems between the Southeast Asian regions are close to being solved. While the U.S. involvement in ASEAN has been linked to regional security and economic growth, considering that US-ASEAN trade is worth $225 billion, its motives are questionable and have come under fire for its hypocrisy and violation of human rights.
The United States wants China to play by the rules, but China doesn’t think they are at fault or that these rules apply because these disputed areas are already under Chinese sovereignty. They believe that they are granted the right to all of the South China Sea and have gone to many extremes to assert their dominance, including deploying surface-to-air missiles on a disputed island, claiming the action to be “appropriate and reasonable.” 
From the U.S. perspective, every individual and country is entitled to rights, and the conflict of the disputed areas involving sovereign states and China is infringing on those states’ sovereignty. Not only that, but some of the waters do not belong to any sovereign state but are international waters per UN designation. China’s recent aggressive and territorial behavior over islands in the South China Sea has irritated other countries and ASEAN members near the region, like Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines. While the countries agreed to approach this situation peacefully and legally, the United States has already angered China by sailing Navy ships near the artificial islands that China created, in order to “demonstrate freedom to sail there” and is looking for additional support from other ASEAN members by holding the summit.
Though it is true that China has been crossing lines with U.S. allies in Southeast Asia, the United States’ involvement with ASEAN is a red flag in itself. Obama said that he would stand with those in the region looking to advance good governance, but four of the 10 Southeast Asian leaders invited to the summit, only four were elected through free and fair elections. The other heads of government came into power through illegal means and most of the 10 members have poor human rights records, including “restrictions on civil society, failures on women’s rights, the political use of courts, high-level corruption, lack of protection of refugees and asylum seekers, human trafficking, and abuses against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people,” according to Human Rights Watch. In the past, the U.S. has backed, funded and even enabled dictatorships, including Thailand’s military coup in 2014, in order to maintain influence in a certain country or region. Despite public statements of disapproval from Secretary of State John Kerry, the administration continued to fund for law enforcement, counterterrorism and non-proliferation programs in Thailand. Though on the surface, the United States is a democratic republic and prides itself on these foundations — its foreign policy of denouncing authoritarian regimes is more of a means to an end. 
U.S’s partnership with authoritarian regimes of ASEAN and its implicit actions toward China makes it clear that the alliance is solely for economic and political gain, disregarding important issues like human rights and democracy. If it were the other way around and China’s authoritarian regime did not pose a threat or even benefitted the United States, the U.S. would be okay with it, adding to its hypocrisy.
Obama can smile at a desert resort with dictators of Southeast Asian countries, promising optimism and peaceful resolution, but based on the U.S.’s past actions and China’s increased militarization and recent deployment of missile systems, it’s clear that this dispute will only lead to mutual escalation and won’t be peacefully resolved anytime soon.

China’s CCP is Stepping all over the Asean Countries and all they do Cry , Cry ,and Cry . China has shown them War is Coming , because of Their Cowering Stance in dealing with China . After at least 10 years of the CCP Militarizing the SCS , Asean still Sits on Their Hands waiting for  ……….. What…. ? . The CCP’s Night-Mare That has Just  Started ……. !
RED FLAG.  Just needs one incident.  
If China claims sovereignty they have every right to protect their territories.  However, China’s actions or no action suggest they are using words to bluff their fake claims.
US and AU with FON will perhaps keep pushing for a RED FLAG to get a result.
Chinese media is asking its Navy or militarized white hulls to ram USN ships.  They should do it.  Let’s see what happens next.
Is China ready to play with the big boys and their toys?  Or is China using big words… but has no credibility?
Erika,
There’s a chess game going on with big powers thinking ahead 10-15 years. Think Realpolitik.
The Chinese government is actually trying to claim sovereignty over almost all of the SCS, in which $4 Trillion in trade passes each year. It wants to eventually control who trades with Taiwan so it can blockade the island into submission, and bring Taiwan under it’s control. China wants to deny non-Chinese military ships from the SCS, mainly the USA, to prevent any assistance to Taiwan trying to resist China’s takeover. There are many other reasons, as well. It’s a total “might makes right” power play.
China had a trade surplus of half a Trillion dollars with the USA last year, and enormous trade surpluses with the USA for the past decade. Why would they want to upset the apple-cart?
I’m all about human rights, and, needless to say, the USA is far from perfect, but China is starting to scare the hell out of a lot of countries. It’s the East Asian countries trying to establish and increase military ties with the USA and each other in response to China. It’s because China is becoming an aggressive expansionist power, not a peacefully rising power.
Do you suppose that it is perhaps in response to the US using its military might and advanced weaponry to control the world?
Nope.
Might makes right.  World powers only stay on top so long.  They will succeed us.
Our influence is waning.
Some have a hard time accepting that. 
Maybe so.  However, it won’t be china that gets the priviledge.
it didn’t say anywhere in the article that China is a “peacefully rising power.” it clearly states and agrees with the fact that China is aggressive and territorial. It might be true that China is starting to scare the hell out of a lot of countries, but it doesn’t mean the U.S. should be involved so deeply into this conflict.

The No. 11 USC women’s tennis team fell 6-1 to No.1 California in the first match in the new Marks Stadium.
“It was definitely a tough loss for us today,” senior Giuliana Olmos said. “I think we were closer than it looks. It’s just been a little bit bumpy for the team right now.”
On Court 1, No.11 Olmos and sophomore Gabby Smith upset Cal juniors No. 2 Maegan Manasse and Denise Starr 6-4. 
“[Olmos] and I played really well in doubles,” Smith said. “We lost to Maegan and Denise in the fall at national indoors, and they played really well. But this time we just came out really strong and we finished them off.” 
On Court 3, freshman Rianna Valdes and sophomore Madison Westby were able to even the score at 5-5 after being down 5-2, but ultimately fell 7-5 to senior Lynn Chi and junior Stephane Lin of Cal. 
In the meanwhile on Court 2, freshman Jessica Failla and junior Zoë Katz, after taking an early 4-1 with two breaks, were reached senior Klara Fabikova and freshman Olivia Hauger, bringing the match and the doubles point to the tie-break. There, the Cal duo was able to finish off the match with a 7-3 win, giving the Bears the doubles point.
The same tune went on in singles. On Court 6, Cal sophomore Karla Popovic stormed through Katz 6-1, 6-3, while on Court 2, No. 5 Fabikova pulled out a double 6-2 over Westby. A little hope for a comeback came from Court 1, where No. 38 Olmos was able to upset No. 13 Manasse in straight sets 6-3, 6-3. 
Shortly after on Court 5, No. 102 Hauger was able to clinch the match, after a 6-4, 6-3 win over No. 90 Valdes. As the rest of the matches went on, Chi defeated No. 87 Smith in the third set match tie-break and Failla lost 6-7(3), 4-6 to Starr, after being down 0-4 in the second set.
“They’re the No. 1 team in the country, so when you have a chance to win the doubles and you don’t get it, it’s frustrating, but I felt that we played some good singles matches,” head coach Richard Gallien said. “We need all the oars in the water, and today we only had some of the oars in the water. I’m super positive and I think by the end of the year we’ll be a really good team, but losses are painful.” 
Next up for the Women of Troy is a match against crosstown rival UCLA, whom they will face Thursday.
“I am definitely looking forward to UCLA,” Olmos said “It’s always fun playing against them, we just need to get going again and get excited.”
Smith pointed out a good start would be beneficial to pulling off the victory.
“I think the key for us is to start off strong again in doubles,” Smith said. “Our whole team can do better in doubles. In singles,  competing well, really fighting hard and playing smart because we can win that match.” 
For Gallien, his team has not quite reached its satisfactory point.
“There has to be some belief,” Gallien said. “I think this team hasn’t had that one win yet where everybody says, ‘Ok, we get it, we’re good.’ That win is still out there and maybe Thursday is the day.” 
First serve is at 1:30 p.m. in Westwood.

We all have those days when we’re in our dorm room studying, and just don’t have the energy to run down to the dining hall. When those times come up, ordering on food delivery apps like Postmates and Doordash don’t always sound like the best choice either — delivery costs add up. After a fair share of those days, I’ve realized that the cheapest, most convenient option (at least for lazy students like me) is to pop a frozen meal in the microwave and wait a few minutes. Luckily, Trader Joe’s offers a variety of healthy frozen meals and snacks that really do satisfy cravings. Below are a few of their best frozen foods. 
1. Stir Fry Vegetables.
 Vegetables might not be your idea of a delicious snack, but this low-calorie vegetable mix actually tastes good. It’s also packed with vitamin A and vitamin C and extremely easy to make.

2. Greens, Beans and Grains. This microwavable meal is a mixture of kale, garbanzo beans, couscous and peanuts. It has tons of nutrients including calcium, iron and fiber. After eating this, you’ll just feel healthier.

3. Vegetarian Masala Burger
This meatless burger is definitely not In-N-Out, but it’s more filling and much healthier. It’s packed with vitamin A and is made of carrots, green beans, bell pepper, potatoes and Indian spices.

4. Mandarin Orange Chicken
This frozen entree is said to be Trader Joe’s best selling product. And with high protein and calcium, it’s a better option than greasy takeout Chinese food!

5. Reduced Guilt Mac & Cheese
Any meal with “reduced guilt” in the name is a meal for me. This cheesy comfort food has less fat and fewer calories than the traditional mac and cheese. You can find this in my freezer.

6. Spinach and Artichoke Dip
 This creamy dip is a blend of artichokes, spinach, Swiss and Parmesan. It goes with almost every random type of cracker or chip lying around my dorm room. Added bonus: it’s low fat!
