Electro-acoustic music is created by the electronic tinkering and adjusting of sounds. Simply by pressing a button or moving a slider, one can create sounds rich in tonality and color that mirror those accomplished by plucking a string or pressing a key. On Monday, the Thornton School of Music invited students to experience these infinite possibilities of electro-acoustic sound.
The ensemble consisted of music composition majors: freshmen Maia Thomas, Sophie Mathieu, Caleb Hannan, Lucy McKnight and Victoria Vasta; senior Richard An; and graduate students Dan Caputo, Ryan McWilliams and Stephen Cabell. Doctor of Musical Arts Composition student Eric Pham led the group.
“There’s ease of access because of the fact that you’re dealing with buttons, knobs and sliders, which everyone interacts with everyday,” Pham said.
Using and interacting with such everyday tools makes learning how to create electro-acoustic music fairly easy, but the actual process of assigning meaning to compositions is a much more nuanced process.
“It’s good to have a set of rules for yourself because it makes you more creative,” Pham said.
The ensemble followed Pham’s advice, and the showcase featured various creative performances while maintaining the distinct ethereal style among the group. Using white noise and dissonance paired with haunting hums and expressive beeps, the ensemble evoked the otherworldly aspect of their music and drew the audience in.
One particular piece, “Gravity Well,” used the musicians’ voices as well as musical effects to create a stirring piece in which the natural and the electronic blended seamlessly. An, Mathieu, McKnight and Maia Thomas sang different notes before they playbacked their recordings, layering individual voices over one another while adjusting the tone and depth of the notes on their controls. As the piece went on, the musicians moved with their composition, looking toward one another and conversing through their electronic instruments.
Another piece, titled “The VII Machine,” showcased the possibilities musicians have when playing music from their laptops. An, Caputo, McWilliams and Thomas deftly went from slider to button to knob, adjusting dissonant sounds and loud beats while adding wobbling effects and changing tempo. The effect was a perfect chaos, in which the overlapping sounds, sudden starts and stops and rich colors of the piece entranced the audience.
“You should be able to explain before you get started what effect you’re trying to get and make sure that everything you add is serving that purpose,” Pham said.
The artists featured in the piece “Lucid Dreaming” achieved their effect of transporting the audience into the semi-conscious state of the dream world. Dancers Stephen Beitler, Jeremy Hahn and Alison Hart from the L.A.-based performance collective Efflorescence, graduate oboe performance student Theodosia Roussos on the English horn, CalArts graduate Kathryn Shuman on vocals and Eric Pham on electronics led the audience into a dreamlike state.
The fluid and then sharp movements of the dancers coupled with Shuman’s altered vocals, Roussos’ mesmerizing English horn and Pham’s dissonant sounds created an atmosphere where everyone was trying to escape from the dream they were stuck in.
The night concluded with a visual and audio performance of “Boomdinger,” showcasing the exciting opportunities music listeners have in the future of electro-acoustic sound. With optical illusion visuals filled with different shapes, letters and outlines, the performers matched their diverse beats to the images projected, creating an eccentric experience for the audience’s senses.
“We need to think about [electronic music] as a valid ensemble and as vigorous and meaningful as a composition of practice,” Pham said.

On Thursday, the USC School of Dramatic Arts will present one of the most iconic American plays of the 20th century, The Kentucky Cycle. Written by Robert Schenkkan in 1991, the Pulitzer Prize-winning play is a series of nine one-acts that span roughly two centuries of the American narrative. This play was no small feat for SDA — the duration is estimated to be roughly six hours, which will be split into a two-part performance.
Schenkkan initially began his career as an actor, acquiring roles in acclaimed series like Star Trek: The Next Generation. He discovered his passion for writing much later in his career, eventually receiving a sizable grant from the Kennedy Center for New American Plays to produce The Kentucky Cycle.
The play follows three fictional families, one black, one white and one Native American. Suffice it to say, the play reveals the diversity of families that settled in America from 1775 to 1975 by not only following their struggles, but also reminding viewers of the issues that bound them together. Though these families each possess their own conflicts, Schenkkan sought to streamline familial tension among the three races.
The play take place throughout history, as the characters face issues such as tribal conflict, the Civil War, poverty, unemployment and even murder. Though these are largely disparate issues, Schenkkan illustrates that each family sought one ultimate goal — the American Dream. In essence, the story underscores the hardship associated with forging a new life in unchartered land.
The production consists of a large cast — 29 student actors play nearly 80 different roles throughout the play. The students, who are part of the School of Dramatic Arts’ theater program, were challenged to play vastly different roles throughout the play.
Stephanie Shroyer, the associate artistic director of the School of Dramatic Arts, directed the play. An actress, choreographer and director, Shroyer possessed the experience necessary to bring the complex, nuanced play to life.
“[The BFA students] had to use their left brain just to sort through the sheer size of the piece, and then the intuitive side, the right brain, to call upon a tremendous emotional and psychological connection to 200 years of a very difficult and tumultuous history in the United States, particularly that of Kentucky,” Shroyer said of her experience working on this production.
After many hours of rehearsal from cast and production team,  the first half of The Kentucky Cycle will debut at the McClintock Theatre on Thursday at 7 p.m., followed by the second half on Friday at 7 p.m. Other showings will take place throughout the weekend and into Tuesday.
“Just to try to take on a piece of this size during school is monumental and worth the six weeks that we spent on it in order to accomplish getting through it,” Shroyer said. “Hopefully there will be a sense of intellectual stimulation for all involved.”

With Moonlight’s win at the Oscars this past Sunday, it felt like a great boundary had been crossed. The win was incipient: A contemporary love story about a black, gay man had won Best Picture. What more blisteringly real and diverse films would this open the floodgates for? Yesterday, I published an editorial column about the victory of Moonlight over La La Land feeling like a subversion of the presidential election — a grand comparison, but also one rooted in familiar themes: A modern movie about minorities won out over one about white nostalgia for an idealistic past.
It is easy to look at this win and feel like justice has been served, that the film industry responded to the #OscarsSoWhite debacle and that progress is the only way forward. But the fact is, these waves of progress are exactly that — waves. There will be good years and bad years, and until the tide changes then nothing will. The systemic nature of Hollywood inequality is made even more explicit when one looks at the constant either under-representation or misrepresentation of Asians and Asian Americans in film. It’s not a coincidence that stereotyped depictions of Asians onscreen make their way into the cultural lexicon. These tropes, passed down through film history, filter themselves into instinctive societal perceptions.
Emma Stone, who took home this year’s Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role for La La Land, was deeply criticized in 2015 for her portrayal of a character named Allison Ng in Cameron Crowe’s Aloha. (Allison is a quarter Asian, Stone is not.) But she moved on, took a role from the plethora readily available for her, and took home her Oscar for it. Truthfully, I don’t think Stone’s involvement in Aloha propelled her career, but it was still one step forward to her Oscar. Imagine what that could have done for an Asian American actress. One step forward.
When it comes to diversity in film and television, it is sometimes difficult not to adopt an “I’ll take what I can get” attitude. Last Sunday, Moonlight’s win felt like an undeniable triumph, a feeling of joy that soars over that attitude. But at the end of the day, things were still bittersweet. Watching the black community celebrate triumphs like Moonlight, Fences and Hidden Figures fills me with both thrill and longing.
I share every ounce of their joy. But a part of me still longs to know what it feels like to be proud of a prominent Asian American actor, a groundbreaking Asian American film. Is there a community of like-minded people out there? Sometimes, it doesn’t feel like it. I knew more Marvel-loving film students willing to defend the decision to cast Tilda Swinton in her traditionally Tibetan role in Doctor Strange than I knew those willing to fight it. More willing to designate this casting choice unavoidable due to political reasons or allegiance to the source material, than one of blatant and ridiculous anti-Asian discrimination.
Maybe these are tricky waters to enter. It’s not like there are a finite number of films that can be made in any given expanse of time. When the medium is imagination, why shouldn’t we demand fuller diversity? One more picture about Asian Americans will not take away the spotlight from anyone else. There is no limit to human creativity and empathy in this world.
Representation is the only way to widen the way people think about each other. And sometimes it hurts to say this, but even stereotyped depictions are better than no depictions at all. Because how else will I see another Asian American onscreen, even if he or she is forced into the kung-fu master/wise sage/dragon lady/nerd box? How else am I to know that I exist in the public conscience?
That is how bad this gets: that we demand Asian American representation, even in these roles that so plainly demean our existence. If movies are mirrors then that is how desperate we are to see ourselves in this reflection of society.
I’ve been told not to make a big deal out of whitewashing, that the misrepresentation and underrepresentation of Asians and Asian Americans in film is not a pressing issue. But how can that be true when an Indian man was killed in Kansas last week in a xenophobic hate crime?
I grew up in a community where the most exposure people got to Asian Americans was through TV, a medium in which we are repeatedly and dependently caricatured. My childhood was marked by an othering so severe that the alienation settled inside myself, lay the groundwork for some of the insecurity I still feel to this day. But in some cases, like in Kansas, this othering is violent and fatal. And I dare you to look me in the eyes and tell me that film and television play no part in perpetuating these stereotypes. The ideas that those who are yellow and brown are necessarily foreign, inherently un-American, and do not hold a place in our society.
When it comes to diversity on-screen, we have a long way to go for minorities of all races. When it comes to Asian Americans, there is a specific and urgent need to depict them in ways that include them in the fabric of this country. I am tired of seeing myself on-screen cloaked only in accents and tropes. I am tired of fighting to see myself on-screen even in these demeaning and generalized forms.
And the truth is, I cannot imagine watching a film where every lead looked like me, being able to do so freely and without feeling like I need to account for the actions of every Asian or Asian American person onscreen. I do not know how to watch Doctor Strange without my heart falling at the depiction of the simple-minded, buffoonish Wong, reading the script for Crash and feeling disappointed that the Asian character is called “the chinaman” the entire time. I don’t know what that’s like, to be thought of as a “default” American and person.
If Moonlight’s win taught us anything, it is that there is no such thing as a niche story. Not when a movie is good. As long as a story portrays emotions realistically and tangibly, it can appeal to everyone. And I demand more Asian stories in cinema. I demand someone to be proud of and a role model for myself and my future children. I want a character to whom I can hold not hesitant allegiance, but blistering pride: an Asian American hero.

I could not disagree with you more! (And i truly mean that respectfully, as I do when expressing all my opinions.) To be honest I don’t like the “alt” moniker either way. I only started using “alt Left” in protest of the ridiculous “alt Right” moniker which is so often used incorrectly to identify normal conservative ideas as extreme. You will always lose the battle with me if you want to discuss “moral equivalencies”… I’m a critical and independent thinker, so I’m aware there are good and bad ideas on both sides, but Conservative ideas like enforcing immigration or diversity by organic means, are NOT extreme or so-called “Alt RIght”. By contrast, the Left embodies all sorts of extreme ideas. Among them: Providing drivers licenses, in-state tuition, and admission to the State Bar for illegal immigrants…. Ignoring established science on gender by suggesting gender is fluid and can be simply chosen…. Lowering the bar for minorities (only) so that we have a more diverse population in colleges…. Changing the definition of marriage, a gender-specific term like “king” or “queen”. One could go on and on. People are welcome to support any of these ideas, but they are extreme positions. What’s not extreme and not alt-right is the idea that we should enforce immigration laws, including deporting people here illegally, or prohibiting people here illegally from practicing law ….that everyone no matter their race, background or income status should face the same standards for admission to schools …respecting gender science while allowing people to ‘express’ themselves how they wish. These ideas have all been described with such disdain, and with the “alt right” label, and it’s not valid. So again, i don’t like the term either way, but i use it to shed light on how imbalanced the discussion has become on these issues.
Now that I’ve launched into all those other issues above, I’m sure you’ll find more room for disagreement… which is fine obviously. I didn’t want to get into everything else when the topic here is diversity in Hollywood, but I often find it difficult to speak about imbalanced Left wing thought without a broader conversation… particularly to highlight the reality that conservative ideas and values are really not so extreme at all when you take a deep breath and think about it. I respect difference of opinion and debate, but I demand it be honest, balanced and sincere. I realize some people want to turn the world upside down (so to speak); Just don’t pretend that those opposed to it are the extreme or “Alt Right” ones.
Oh and PS: I will double down on my point that the “Alt Left” has become very militant. Just look at the marches and protests and even riots, where signs read: “Undocumented and Unafraid”. Wow! And they wonder why much of America is pushing back.
The whole “diversity” conversation is just so misplaced in the Hollywood and movie context.  Nobody knows what they’re talking about.  I assume it comes from a good place, but it’s just so misguided.  Filmmaking and storytelling is completely subjective.  Hollywood is a subjective business, and it should be!  You can not legislate taste or preference.  People see the movies they want to see. People make the movies they want to make.  You can’t “demand” Asian characters, or black characters.  Nor can you demand black directors or female directors.  This is just total nonsense.  Entertainment is a wholly subjective business.  It is an escape from reality.  I work in the industry and let me assure you there is one mandate:  Make money!  That’s always the bottom line.  There should be no mandate for diversity in entertainment.  If people would “like” to see more diversity, then by all means… encourage more women or minorities to pursue careers in entertainment.  Encourage filmmakers to write roles for women or minorities.  But “demand” is the wrong word completely.  The alt-Left has become so militant.  By the way… let’s not forget that Hollywood was created by white people.  Who cares?!  It’s a fact that is meaningless except that it perhaps explains why white people are so entrenched in the business on and off screen.  All of this artificial social engineering just has to stop.   By the way, blacks and gays are very well represented in Hollywood (again, on and off screen)… so Moonlight really didn’t break any ground.  Good movie though.  Many liked it; Many didn’t.  Who cares!  It’s entertainment!!!
I almost agreed with most of what you said, but then you had to fuck it up with the Alt Left comment.  LOL   There’s no need to make false equivalencies. No matter how hard you try there’s no equivalent movement on the other side to the Alt Right.

The Oscars raced to make up for last year’s Oscars So White, but along the way forgot that there’s more to American than black and white.  25% of America is neither white nor black.  And they weren’t represented.   Nice work; esp the last paragraph.
The movies were well into production before the Oscars So White controversy, so it had no connection to that.  Quit creating this narrative that Hollywood somehow could respond that fast, that’s not how movies get made.  Also I’m all for more diverse films inclusive of all minorities, but quit using Black success/progress as podiums to voice your displeasure, it comes incredibly close to Anti-Blackness, when your focus should be on the homogeneous of Whiteness that permeates most of Hollywood’s films.
Not the most logical response.  Whether the movies were in production by the time of Oscars So White last year is irrelevant.  There were moves with blacks in them for last year’s Oscars but they chose NOT to nominate them; this year they did.  That’s the difference.     Anti-blackness?  Get out of here.  It’s great that blacks were recognized but we shouldn’t stop there.
What does Blacks in films being nominated by the Oscars have anything to do with the lack of other minorities even being cast in films?  That’s my point.  Black films have been a thing for decades and have been overlooked for quite some times such as Do the Right Thing not getting nominated for Best Picture despite most critics not only believing it was the Best film of that year, but one of the best of that decade.  Same with Malcolm X not getting a Best Picture nomination.  My point is Blacks being acknowledged for their work in Hollywood that they’ve been apart of for decades is a separate and different argument than the diversity argument addressing the systemic issues in not casting minorities.  Quit conflating the two.
What you’re saying is that blacks are due recognition (that’s overdue) but non-black minorities are not.  That blacks were wronged in the past, but non-black minorities were not.
That’s not what I’m saying.  I’m saying they’re two different issues so there’s no need to bring one up when discussing the other.  Moonlight is a low budget (1.5 million) film starring an all Black cast, written and directed by a Black man based off of a play written by a Black man.  That’s not indicative of Hollywood considering diversity to only mean Black people, it’s literally Black people doing it on their own.   There’s nothing stopping any other minority group to do the same in that regard, which still doesn’t address the systemic issues in Hollywood that excludes other minority groups.   The issues are deep, and if you don’t address those problems and only recognize the symptoms, then you’re going to be commenting on this same article being written 10 years from now wondering why the data hasn’t changed much for other minorities and Blacks having progressed in Hollywood.
Courtney.. I totally get the passion with which you and others discuss this issue, but again, it’s completely misplaced and misguided.  Hollywood and the business of filmmaking is a completely subjective business, involving completely subjective tastes.  There is no mandate for films or television shows to reflect society.  They might, they might not.  This is a made-up problem that has nothing to do with ACTUAL civil rights abuses and sins of the past.  It is regrettable (though necessary) that in a free society, we will always encounter individual racism, but “systemic” racism is a thing of the past… This is California, not the South. How dare anyone try to bring this issue to California and the Hollywood entertainment industry… demonizing good, honest and non-racist people in the process.  It’s disgusting.  There is no systemic racism in Hollywood.  It’s simply not true.

Known for its street food and fads, Los Angeles has a culinary culture like no other city in the world. The NoMad Truck, which integrates both fine dining and casual street cuisine into one spectacular dining experience, launched last fall serving the streets of Los Angeles. The NoMad Truck has the typical fast food found in a food truck but with a very Californian twist to it, transforming an average menu into an upscale version of comfort food.
The original NoMad restaurant fits perfectly in New York, but the version opening in Los Angeles later this year will cater to Los Angeles’ unique culture. Each month, a local L.A. chef will collaborate with the food truck to test their take on a chicken burger against the NoMad’s. They kicked off the food truck year in Koreatown, which featured Chef Roy Choi, and created the “Roy Choi,” a chicken dumpling burger with shrimp, chili and ginger. Other featured chefs include Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo.
Satisfying the foodies and Instagrammers alike, the truck is extremely aesthetically pleasing for any social media feed with the baby blue exterior and modern NoMad logo. The food truck itself is on the opposite end of the dining spectrum from The NoMad Hotel in New York — a five-star hotel and dining establishment located north of Madison Square Park. Aside from co-owning The NoMad in New York City, Chef Daniel Humm also co-owns Eleven Madison Park alongside restaurateur Will Guidara.
The staff was beyond friendly and took the time out of the hectic lunch rush to get to know locals and the city. Moreover, the food itself was comfort food without the lingering guilt resulting from a junk food splurge. Ground chicken with truffles perfectly grilled into a mouthwatering burger? It’s nearly impossible to feel guilty for eating something that sounds both healthy and phenomenal simultaneously.
For desserts and other sweet treats, try Humm’s speciality, the milk & honey soft serve, a vanilla soft serve drizzled with honey and a crunchy topping to curb the salt craving. Another of Humm’s best items is the Humm Dog, a bacon wrapped hot dog with french fries, which makes for a great casual lunch.
NoMad Los Angeles is expected to open in fall of this year in the Giannini Place, located in downtown Los Angeles. Unfortunately, the opening of the restaurant possibly signals the closing of the iconic food truck, yet the baby blue aesthetic and top-notch menu items will live on inside of the new restaurant.Tracking down the NoMad Truck is no easy feat, but is most definitely worth the effort. The hours and location of the truck are not posted on social media until the day of or a few days beforehand, keeping up with spontaneity of exploring Los Angeles throughout the year via a food truck.
Hopefully, the NoMad Truck will continue to make its rounds after the permanent restaurant opens.

Three nights removed from a gut-wrenching one-point loss to Arizona State in Tempe, the USC men’s basketball team (21-8, 8-8) takes the court at the Galen Center on Wednesday in search of its first win in 20 days. The Trojans’ opponent: the Washington State Cougars (13-15, 6-10).
“We’ve been impressed with Washington State all season,” head coach Andy Enfield said after Tuesday’s practice. “Coach [Ernie] Kent’s done a great job with them, especially in Pac-12 play.”
The two teams last met on Feb. 3 in frosty Pullman, Wash., where USC rode a hot offense to an 86-77 win. The Trojans shot 57 percent from the field in that contest and rallied from an 11-point deficit in the first half. Sophomore forward Chimezie Metu scored a career-high 29 points, and freshman guard Jonah Matthews added 18 off the bench. The Trojans left Washington with a sweep for the first time in 15 years, a healthy squad for the first time all season and a four-game win streak in tow.
This time around, USC carries a four-game skid into Wednesday night’s game, which is threatening the Trojans’ postseason hopes. It’s their longest losing streak in two years.
“It’s a different sort of feeling,” junior guard Elijah Stewart said. “We let a couple games go that we should’ve won. We’ve just got to finish out strong right now.”
But morale is not down, and intensity has ratcheted up.
“Practice has gotten a little chippy,” Stewart said. “We’re all competitors. We all enjoy the intensity. It’s going to make us better in games.”
USC expects to earn a postseason berth, whereas Washington State knows it has two games left to play this year. That spells danger for USC, as the veteran Cougars may come into this contest ready to empty the tank. On Sunday — Senior Day in Pullman — all four Cougar seniors scored in double figures to beat favored in-state rival Washington, 79-71.
“We have to play as hard as we can, and whatever happens happens,” Enfield said.
Two seniors in particular, guard Ike Oroegbu and forward Josh Hawkinson, have paced the Cougars throughout the season. Oroegbu scored 22 versus the Trojans earlier this month, and he has scored at least 15 points in four of WSU’s last five contests. For the season, he is averaging 12.6 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game.
Hawkinson, meanwhile, has found his place in the annals of Cougar basketball. Last time versus USC, he became WSU’s second all-time rebounder — a testament to his four years of hard work in the paint. He finished that game with 17 points and 16 rebounds. On Wednesday night, he could set the school record with 11 more boards. Enfield called Hawkinson a “double-double machine.”
On the other side of the court, USC will be significantly younger, playing no seniors and three freshmen.
“Our freshmen have had terrific seasons,” Enfield said. “They’ve been a little streaky, but most freshmen are. We would not have 21 wins without our four freshmen contributing. They’ve got to play like sophomores the last week of the season and into the tournament.”
For USC’s postseason aspirations to stay alive, those freshmen will have to help USC get at least a 22nd win Wednesday versus Washington State.
“We’re taking it one game at a time,” freshman guard De’Anthony Melton said. “If we start looking too far forward, we might lose to a team we should beat.”

Men’s swimming, ranked No. 13 in the nation, will head to the Pac-12 Championships, which will run from Wednesday through Saturday in Federal Way, Wash. The conference championships will offer some of the toughest competition in the country, as USC will have to take down No. 1 Cal and No. 5 Stanford to bring the title back to Los Angeles.
The diving team already competed during the men’s diving championships last weekend, which were held alongside the women’s Pac-12 Championships. Junior Dashiell Enos took home the 3-meter springboard title for the second year in a row, with freshman Henry Fusaro finishing close behind in second place. Enos won with a 428.35 score, and Fusaro followed him up with a score of 408.15. Both performances were personal bests, firmly outpacing Arizona State’s Heikki Makikallio, who finished in third with 372.50 points.
Enos also reached his first 1-meter final and took fourth on the platform, while freshman Nick Mamola finished eighth in his first conference final competition. Enos took home fourth place with a final score of 335.95, and Mamola finished with 291.20 points.
The Trojans finished second in last year’s conference championship after taking home the title in 2015 for the first time since 1979. USC has not had three consecutive top-two finishes in the Pac-12 since the mid-’70s, but it’s an accomplishment the Trojans could achieve with all of their 2016 Pac-12 swim champions still on the squad.
Senior co-captain Reed Malone will return in his final Pac-12 championship to defend his conference titles in the 200y and 500y freestyle, and fellow senior co-captain Steven Stumph will look to repeat in the 200y breaststroke and become the first Trojan to win the event three years in a row. Junior Ralf Tribunstov will also look to protect his 100y backstroke title, while sophomore Patrick Mulcare will race again in the 200y backstroke.
Sophomores Alex Valente and Carsten Vissering will also return to the pool after finishing second overall in the 100y butterfly and the 100y breaststroke, respectively, at last season’s championships. Vissering will enter this week’s competition as the top seed in the conference in the 100y breaststroke.
Redshirt junior Dylan Carter is also the top seed in the 200y freestyle, and the Trojans will enter the pool as top seeds in the 200y freestyle relay. The team will look to continue its dominance in the 100y freestyle event, which it has won three times in the past five years.
The Trojans boast a balanced team of seasoned upperclassmen including All-Americans such as Malone, Mulcare and Tribuntsov and 2016 Olympians such as Carter (Trinidad and Tobago) and redshirt junior
Santo Condorelli (Canada).
The championships will kick off at the Weyerhaeuser King County Aquatic Center on Wednesday with the 200y medley and 800y freestyle relays. Thursday will feature the 500y freestyle, 200y individual medley, 50y freestyle sprint and 200y freestyle relay. Friday will be the longest day for the Trojans, with races in the 400y individual medley, 100y fly, 200y freestyle, 100y breaststroke, 100y backstroke and 400y medley relay.
The tournament will conclude on Saturday with the 1650y freestyle, 200y backstroke, 100y freestyle, 200y breaststroke, 200y butterfly and 400y freestyle relay.
These four days will be a test to see if the Trojans can compete among the best of the best in both the Pac-12 and the NCAA, setting the stage for the national championships in March.

Growing up, I idolized Mia Hamm.
When my mom dropped me off for third grade soccer practices, she told me to play like Mia. It didn’t matter that I spent most of my time sucking on orange rinds and kicking at dandelions or that I wasn’t particularly fast or outrageously talented with the ball. I loved soccer, and that meant that I wanted to be like Mia.
I fell out of love with soccer in middle school, then fell rapidly and suddenly and irrevocably back into it during the 2012 London Olympics. Our men’s team, as usual, didn’t earn an appearance, but the U.S. women’s national team was at one of its many peaks, riding the tandem of Abby Wambach and Alex Morgan to a redemptive victory over Japan.
It doesn’t take much for most sports fans to fall in love with particular teams — a single player or game or year, or sometimes even just a jersey. All it took was the 2012 Olympics to get me stuck on women’s soccer.
I followed the sport through the birth of the National Women’s Soccer League in 2012 and screamed my way through the 2015 World Cup final. I fumed along with my favorite players as they lodged demands for equal pay rights. In short, I became that typical obnoxious superfan. I understand the ins and outs of the U.S. team’s lineups, injuries and controversies better than I understand any of my linguistics homework due this Thursday.
Which is why last summer’s loss in the quarterfinals of the Olympics, when the highly favored USWNT crashed out against Sweden, didn’t come as a shock to me. For anyone following the team, the loss was, in fact, a long time coming for a variety of reasons.
For too long, the United States Soccer Federation has centered its women’s program around a few stars who have become household names. First it was Hamm, then Wambach and Megan Rapinoe and now Morgan. These stars built the program and the fanbase that followed. But the federation’s dependence on this handful of players has also built the possibility for future disaster for U.S. soccer.
Before I continue, let me get a singular part of this discussion out of the way — U.S. women’s soccer is U.S. soccer. The women sell more tickets and jerseys, draw in more viewers and win more trophies than the men. Period. So with that being said, the success of U.S. soccer relies strongly on the success of its women’s team.
It’s an anomaly in sports, really, to have a women’s program be the frontrunner of a sport — except when you look at the Olympics, where American women dominate the podiums and the viewership in gymnastics, tennis, swimming, track and a plethora of other events. But the U.S. women’s soccer team is different in that it is making the sport a profitable industry in America.
Not yet, of course. The NWSL isn’t able to offer livable salaries to full rosters yet, and there’s been a recent shift in American players signing with European clubs during their offseasons, driving attention across the Atlantic. But between record ticket sales for the national program, a new club team opening in North Carolina and a reasonable TV deal with Lifetime, the sport is coming alive rapidly.
It’s not the NFL. But it’s something, and for women’s sports, that’s saying a lot.
But although women’s soccer has done well in regard to profit margins and salary advancements in recent years, the U.S. team is coming off its worst performance in almost a decade. After riding the hype of a record-breaking World Cup victory, the team fell to Sweden in the 2016 Rio Olympics, dashing dreams of becoming the first-ever program to win back-to-back World Cup and Olympic titles.
Some called it shocking, but most fans saw it coming from a mile away.
The coaches and managers at the USSF have often clung to veteran stalwarts long past their prime. That was evidenced throughout the World Cup every time that Wambach, who used to be one of the most powerful players in the world, trudged around the field for a compulsory 20 minutes each game.
At the time, Wambach wasn’t even participating in full practices with the rest of the team. She acknowledged her poor physical shape, which kept her from producing useful touches or opportunities and left a weak side during transitions.
Head coach Jill Ellis cited Wambach’s leadership as the reason for her continuation with the team, and that made sense during the 2015 World Cup due to its extended roster of 23 players. But for all her ability to lead, Wambach’s presence on the field was — for lack of more tactful words — useless.
I know what you’re going to say here: Didn’t the U.S. go on to win the World Cup in thrilling style, climaxing in a thorough 5-2 devastation of Japan? Yes. Yes they did, and it was awesome, and I cried for about 68 percent of it.
But Ellis followed that poor decision with another: the Olympic roster, which included a barely healthy Rapinoe who wasn’t even cleared to play full games when the Americans touched down in Rio.
In the final minutes of the match against Sweden, Ellis played Rapinoe in place of a healthy and more skilled Tobin Heath in that game against Sweden, forcing Heath to rotate into defense in place of Kelley O’Hara, an actual defender. And the Americans lost in penalty kicks. It was brutal. It was sad. But it wasn’t shocking in the slightest.
This mistake was a repetition of the same pattern from the previous year: calling up a player who isn’t physically prepared to compete due to their star status — and disguising that star status as “leadership ability.”
It’s not necessarily the fault of Ellis or the federation, though I can passionately complain about the ineptitude of both. Rather, it’s a pattern of sticking to the “old guard,” the group of players who made this team and therefore, it is assumed, will break this team if not present on the field.
As the USWNT kicks off a new year of play on Wednesday with a friendly against Germany, the program must keep the pain of that loss fresh in order to keep looking toward the future rather the past. Today’s roster is more promising than the one presented in Rio. Rapinoe isn’t listed, and a quarter of the players are young hopefuls who have been groomed well by their college or club teams.
This type of turnover is the core necessity of the team’s ability to continue to improve. It’s the ability to continue moving toward a better future for women’s soccer that will keep competition fresh and prevent our team from becoming stagnant.
Mia and Abby and Rapinoe will always be our stars. But the federation’s foremost goal should be to honor their legacies by molding new stars, both on our field and on our crest.

Rising to the occasion · Junior forward Kristen Simon was named to the All-Pac-12 Team after leading USC in scoring and rebounding this year – Jo Danielle Esteban | Daily Trojan
Three Trojans garnered All-Pac-12 honors on Tuesday as the women’s basketball team continued preparations for its conference tournament, which begins on Thursday with a game against Cal.
Junior forward Kristen Simon was named to the All-Pac-12 Team, while senior guard Courtney Jaco was an honorable mention for the All-Pac-12 and All-Defensive teams. Freshman guard Minyon Moore rounded out the trio, earning a spot on the All-Freshman Team.
Simon is USC’s leading scorer and rebounder this season, and her spot on the All-Pac-12 Team is the first all-conference honor of her career. Simon was named Pac-12 Player of the Week on Dec. 5, and she has notched 10 double-doubles so far this campaign, leading the Trojans in scoring in 10 games and pacing the team in rebounds on 19 occasions. Simon also won Most Valuable Player at the Great Alaska Shootout in November, as she led the Trojans to victories over Missouri State and Portland.
Senior captain Jaco nabbed her second consecutive All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention this year (the All-Defensive Honorable Mention was the first of her career). The guard provides plenty of offense for the Trojans as the No. 2 all-time 3-point scorer in program history, and four more baskets from beyond the arc will tie her career high of 72 3-point makes in one season. But Jaco was also honored for her defense this year (she averages over a steal per game) and for her role as a workhorse, as she leads USC in minutes played.
Moore is the youngest member of the trio of all-conference Trojans, and she has already made her mark at USC. Moore was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Week twice this season — most recently last week — and was the first player in program history to be selected as the USBWA National Freshman of the Week. Her 15 assists against Sacramento State in December was the second-highest single-game tally in USC history, and Moore leads her team in both steals (2.0) and assists (4.0) per game.
With this trio of stars in their lineup, the Trojans will now look to make a Cinderella run in the Pac-12 Tournament. Nine-seed USC will hope to edge Cal in the first round before upsetting top-seeded Oregon State in the quarterfinals. The Trojans’ tournament opener against the Bears tips off in Seattle at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday.
What a disappointing regular season once again. Hopefully changes will be made by AD Swann to get this program back on
the right track. First time in many, many years I did not see one conference game live at the Galen Ctr. They upset Oregon St.
already, and where did it get them with a 5 – 13 record in the Pac-12. Almost every top contributor is returning unless a woman
or two decide to transfer so new leadership is definitely needed at the top.

By now, we have all heard about how the registry for the University Village’s residences, which will house about 2,600 students, is full. Accompanying this news was widespread disappointment and frustration — the University Village had been marketed as a USC icon, the crown jewel of President C. L. Max Nikias’ tenure so far. It seemed as if those 2,600 coveted spots would never cease to be available — but they have. Rising sophomores have been given preference for housing at the University Village, and it can easily be assumed that the reason for doing so is to provide young students who do not yet know how to navigate independent life with an easy way to figure out where they will live in their second year of college. However, if the University is concerned about making sure that younger members of the Trojan Family can reliably find housing, a class-based approach to distributing housing spots may miss the mark.
Throughout this University Village escapade, there has been one constant talking point: Rising sophomores get preference for housing. It is undoubtedly true that students new to college probably do not have the best understanding of where to go for housing — and that is likely why most freshmen choose to live in USC’s on-campus dorms. However, as a student who will be graduating before he will ever be able to grace the brick-and-mortar halls of the University Village while a student, I am a little disappointed that students from all classes did not have an equal shot at enjoying such a unique living environment.
Housing for freshmen is one thing, but giving preference to sophomores — who are considered upperclassmen by the University — over other upperclassmen is quite another. Sophomores have been on-campus for a year, have come to understand how to live and work in the university environment and are rapidly becoming more mature and independent. In short, the difference between a sophomore and a junior is not always significant or apparent at first glance. Why USC would choose to distinguish between sophomores and presumably older upperclassmen is therefore unclear.
I write “presumably older” because I would also like to draw attention to the fact that not all upperclassmen are older than other members of the USC community. I, for example, am 20 years old — about the average age of a sophomore — but I am categorized as a senior by the University. It is conceivable that in another life, I could easily be enjoying preferential selection for a spot at the University Village right now.
Younger-than-normal students like myself are not the only ones who may be affected by the University’s system of prioritization in housing assignments. Increasingly and across the nation, colleges are enrolling older students as well. The Atlantic reported in 2011 that a quarter of all American undergraduate students were over the age of 30. Imagine, say, a 26-year-old sophomore getting preference over a 19-year-old junior for a spot at the University Village. Such a circumstance would be absurd — and admittedly unlikely — but exactly what USC’s system could currently allow.
UCLA, on the other hand, has a system of housing assignment in place that would prevent the above scenario from happening. UCLA differentiates in its housing allocation system between non-traditional students, students with families and traditional students. This allows those who most likely need assistance finding housing and navigating responsibility — younger students — to actually receive the support they may need while also being aware of the needs of other, non-traditional members of the UCLA community.
Perhaps USC should consider moving away from class-based considerations when doling out housing assignments and instead evaluate a student’s fit for University-sponsored housing based on their individual circumstances. At the least, it would put us on even footing with our crosstown rivals.

Am I the only upperclassman that isn’t mad about not getting a spot in the University Village for next year? All 2,600 spots at the University Village filled up almost immediately after the housing lottery began, causing many students to be disappointed. Upperclassmen who dreamed of living in the University Village since they were freshmen have every right to feel a bit snubbed by President C. L. Max Nikias and USC Housing, but giving priority to underclassmen is still the best way to assign housing.
Under USC’s housing system, current freshmen (rising sophomores) typically receive first priority. This generally makes the most sense, given the time that housing is decided and the fact that upperclassmen (current sophomores and juniors) likely have a better idea of off-campus housing than these current freshman students. With housing decisions made in March, this is still relatively early into freshmen’s school year.
In the March of my freshman year, I didn’t know anything about off-campus housing. I wasn’t very involved on campus yet, so most of my friends were fellow freshmen — I only personally knew a handful of people who lived in non-USC housing. If I hadn’t gotten a spot in USC housing, I would have been completely lost.
Second-semester freshmen are typically not ready to figure out the confusing world of contracts, sublets and utilities bills that make up off-campus housing. Granted, there are some older sophomores who might have started school later, and therefore would definitely be mature enough to figure out housing. However, regardless of age, anyone who has lived on campus for under a year is at a disadvantage in finding housing over someone who has lived in the area for two years or more.
USC’s current system prioritizes the students who need USC housing most. We might deserve it more as upperclassmen — we’re the ones who have been dealing with the endless University Village construction for our entire college career — but ultimately, we’ll be able to figure out our own housing situation. By the time a USC student is a rising junior or senior, they undoubtedly have some knowledge of off-campus housing, and if not, they have friends who can make recommendations or help find them a room.
In some ways, university housing also makes it easier on whoever is funding the cost of housing, whether it is the parents or students. University housing attaches the cost of housing to the student’s main bill, making it easier to apply loans or scholarships toward housing. While it would be ideal for this to be the case for all students, with a limited number of USC Housing spots, it makes sense to limit this opportunity to families who are relatively new to figuring out annual college costs.
However, the debate surrounding whether or not underclassmen should receive priority for housing merely distracts from another USC housing controversy: The decision to convert Troy Hall and Troy East into a new “Master’s Village,” designed for graduate students. This removed valuable spots that previously went to undergraduates, making it even more difficult for upperclassmen to secure spaces in USC Housing.
When plans for the University Village were initially discussed, many students were led to believe that the point of the Village would be to alleviate the demand for USC Housing from upperclassmen. USC could have achieved this either by using the UV exclusively for upperclassmen (junior and senior) housing, or by using the Village to house sophomores, opening up spaces traditionally taken by underclassmen in buildings like Troy Hall to upperclassmen. Instead, it converted these spaces into residents for graduate students, so upperclassman undergraduates are still left out.
For this, upperclassmen are right to be upset. However, blaming the system for prioritizing current freshmen ignores the larger problem, which is that USC was misleading about the intentions for the University Village and chose to increase graduate housing, instead of using the Village to leverage even more spots for undergraduates in other buildings.
As frustrating as this is, upperclassmen will be okay. We’ll all eventually find off-campus housing (which is very likely much cheaper than the Village anyway), and it will be way less stressful than dropping a current freshman into the off-campus housing hunt.

Photo from Women’s March on Washington
Following the Women’s March on Washington and its sister marches around the world, Chinese women were noticeably absent from the international media spotlights. This is because street protests and demonstrations that “promote falsehoods” are illegal in China, and the Chinese government has a history of cracking down and retaliating against public events and figures that bring light to gender inequality.
While the Chinese government’s restriction of public protests and demonstrations is nothing new, over the past few years, China has been slowly increasing its censorship of feminist media and publications. For example, in 2015, the imprisonment by the government of the Feminist Five, a group of vocal Chinese women’s rights activists, made headlines and led to an international outcry, leading to their subsequent release. The members of the group had been detained for distributing pamphlets about sexual harassment on March 8, International Women’s Day.
This event from last year also mirrors a recent attack on feminist press. Just last week, a Chinese feminist social media account run on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, was suspended for a month after it re-posted news about a strike taking place in the United States to honor International Women’s Day. The account, Feminist Voices, which is one of the most popular in the nation with 80,000 followers, has temporarily moved to a different name. Citizens reacted with anger and fear on social media, warning of the threat to general civil liberties and to women’s groups who want to remain outspoken against U.S. President Donald Trump and on gender equality issues. 
However, besides high-profile cases such as this, the more insidious censorship and oppression of female artists and writers in China who dedicate their lives to the production of pieces that will inform and illuminate a worldwide audience has remained less publicized throughout the last year.
Consider the film Hooligan Sparrow, which was on this year’s short list for the Oscars category of feature length documentary. The director, Nanfu Wang, captured the story of Ye Haiyan, one of the most prominent women’s rights activists in China. Ye and seven other activists risked arrest for publicly protesting against the outcome of a child rape case in Hainan involving a government official. Wang filmed undercover and smuggled the footage out of the country. The documentary was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival.
Before the announcements of the final Oscar nominees, local authorities shut off all of Ye’s utilities and Internet from her apartment on the outskirts of Beijing. The film was not ultimately included in the nominee list; if it had been, Ye would have had an extremely difficult time remaining in China and most likely would have had to leave the country somehow, though the government confiscated her passport in 2014. Ye is now facing eviction, and her daughter is not allowed to enroll in school because of Ye’s political activities. 
The film is strictly prohibited from being shown within China but has garnered international acclaim. Wang and Chinese organizations have worked to plan underground screenings of the film domestically, risking government backlash.
Though the Chinese government supposedly supports the promotion of gender equality, it views any press or publicity that reveals a less-than-stellar status quo of women’s rights as a threat to its order and stability. Working in these unfavorable conditions, Chinese feminists have increased efforts and are looking to forge alliances with other women’s rights activists in the United States and beyond in order to foster international awareness. Journalists and activists such as Lu Pin, who is New York-based, have founded organizations such as the Chinese Feminism Collective that promotes the communication of Chinese feminism to Western nations. 
Feminism is most definitely NOT about gender equality.   It is, instead, a bigoted, (reverse-) sexist, female supremacist, and fascist hate movement.  While free speech (feminist hate speech) should never be banned or attacked by rioting lieberal antifas, we need to spread awareness about the world’s most officially coddled hate movement.

The Ladybugs Movement, which focuses on ways to help homeless women access basic feminine and hygiene products, is one of the latest service organizations on campus. The organization was started by Crystal Arellano, a master’s student studying health education and promotion.
The idea to lead the organization started in the summer of 2016. Arellano, Iselin Arias, Lucy Chen and Gigi Ady, masters students studying social work and public health at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, as well as Irene Cuevas and Shell Barba, two close friends of Arellano’s from high school, decided to kickstart an organization to provide hygiene products for women in need. 
“This campaign brings together womanhood, hygiene, health and vulnerable populations,” Arellano said. 
While traveling in Cuba, Arellano was faced with an urgent need for feminine products and could not access them. Her experience inspired the Ladybugs Movement.
Another motivation was the community in South Central Los Angeles, where many homeless women lack basic access to fundamental resources like feminine hygiene products.
Since the organization’s founding, the Ladybugs Movement has worked in coordination with several shelters in Los Angeles to understand the specific needs of homeless women in the community. The organization has held three drives for donations of all kinds of feminine hygiene products, as well as running a GoFundMe, which to date has received over $880 in donations for products. During these drives, the Ladybugs Movement has collected items like maxi pads, feminine cleansing wipes, hand sanitizer, tissue paper, body wash, shampoo, first aid kits and nail clippers. The group assembled the products into hygiene kits and donated them to the Downtown Women’s Center and the Los Angeles Mission, which specialize in caring for women. To date, the organization has donated more than 1,300 kits.
Arias, the USC graduate student government director of community service, has worked with the Ladybugs Movement nearly since its inception. To her, the value of the organization is in the impact that it is having on both the community and the women of Skid Row. 
“Spreading the awareness about the need of hygiene products for homeless women and knowing that I can make a difference makes me happy,” Arias said. “I know the homeless women in L.A. who will receive the hygiene packs will [see] a difference in their health and way of living.”
The Ladybugs Movement is looking to build off its recent successes. Working with the USC Graduate Student Government and the USC Master of Public Health Student Association, the organization held a month-long drive during the month of February at USC for feminine and hygiene products. Within two weeks, the collection boxes were completely filled. On the heels of its success, the Ladybugs Movement is planning to host a kit-making day. They anticipate to make over 2,000 kits in a single day on March 5.
Arellano said that she is proud of the response to the Ladybugs Movement thus far.
“I was nervous and afraid of the backlash,” Arellano said. “Womanhood and menstruation are rarely openly talked about. Therefore, I was afraid that people would judge and be turned away by the sensitivity of these topics. But, to my surprise, my colleagues united. We knew that this was a social and public health issue that needed more recognition and with our knowledge, resources, evidence based approaches [and] connections, we have continued to grow the conversation.”

Since last January, robotics expert S.K. Gupta led the Viterbi School of Engineering’s latest project — the Center for Advanced Manufacturing. After a full 13 months of development, CAM held its grand opening last Friday.
Located in downtown Los Angeles, the 6,000-square-foot establishment will equip students with firsthand knowledge and experience with advanced technologies. Funding for research projects at the center will come from a wide variety of sponsors, including the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Department of Defense.   
“It’s amazing to see what kind of impact it has on a national level,” said Kyler Correia, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering. “By pairing ourselves with institutes such as the Department of Defense, we truly establish ourselves as one of the top universities in the country.”
The center will provide new and advanced technologies such as affordable 3-D printing, machines and equipment to support additive manufacturing, robotics, machining, polymer processing, augmented reality and virtual reality. These amenities will be available not only to the USC community, but also communities beyond Los Angeles and California. 
“CAM will enable the Southern California community to learn about advanced manufacturing and its relationship to innovation,” Gupta said. 
This knowledge can be used to make informed decisions about careers in manufacturing, develop innovative products by exploiting advanced manufacturing capabilities and grow manufacturing businesses in  the L.A. area, according to Gupta.
“It’s amazing to see what USC adds to the community,” Correia said. “The potential for what CAM can do not only for the students and for Los Angeles, but for the world is limitless.” 
CAM’s main purpose is to conduct basic and applied research to enable advances in manufacturing. More specifically, this goal would be attained by developing interdisciplinary manufacturing education programs by supporting K-12 communities in the Southern California region. According to Correia, by providing manufacturing services to students and inventors, these populations can better serve the Los Angeles community.
“The USC Center for Advanced Manufacturing is poised to become the premier research and innovation center on advanced manufacturing in the greater Los Angeles area,” said Viterbi Dean Yannis C. Yortsos. “It will serve the academic community and also help support the fast-growing technological ecosystem in Silicon Beach.”
CAM will feature classrooms for the training and instruction of undergraduates and graduate-level students, a design studio, machine lab and industrial robots. 
“I’m really excited to be attending an institution that is constantly providing its students with new and advanced resources,” said Jerry Tejada, a freshman majoring in computer science/business administration. “CAM’s objectives truly represent the tie and impact that USC has on the enrichment of the L.A. community.” 
The Center for Advanced Manufacturing will function as a resource for students and businesses, and also as the site of manufacturing for a number of companies in the aerospace and biomedical industries. The aim of this initiative is to bring down the cost of medical devices with a more market-friendly approach.
“Innovation in manufacturing can speed up creation of new products, and cost-effective manufacturing can enable products to be made closer to the customers,” Gupta said.
Shunta Hashimoto, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering, applauded the University for developing the program. 
“It is remarkable that USC and Viterbi are taking the proper steps and initiatives to be the forefront of this issue,” Hashimoto said.

The Department of Public Safety met with the Association of Indian Students to discuss methods for improving student-officer relationships, on Monday.
The meeting, held at the USC University Religious Center, addressed students’ concerns at their annual international foods festival.
Erwin Valencia, the community relations officer for DPS, meets regularly with AIS and suggested that the organization should invite DPS to their foods festival this semester. Valencia, who is also the international student liaison for DPS, stressed the importance of strong relationships in the USC and overall L.A. community.
“The idea here is that the students can get to know us more,” Valencia said. “That way, in the future, if they need something or if they become victims of something, they know DPS officers are here for them.”
Valencia encouraged students to reach out to him via telephone and Facebook, about issues ranging from petty theft to landlord abuse.
“If they need something and they reach out, we want to look for a possible solution to the problem,” Valencia said.
Students also sought to discuss homelessness, theft and other prevalent issues affecting the USC community. According to Valencia, several student body associations have organized events with DPS aimed at improving student-officer relations, especially in light of the current presidential administration.
According to DPS Chief John Thomas, student citizenship status is not a concern among DPS or LAPD officers, and DPS is working to relieve this fear through similar community relations events. Thomas said LAPD has no authority to ask people for their immigration status, which has been a department policy since 1979. Thomas stressed DPS’ commitment to USC students and the community surrounding USC, especially expressing their willingness to help the international student population.
Thomas said that many international students are unaware of the help available to them at the University. Thomas continued to explain that citizens from certain countries such as India do not have close relationships with police, which often causes mistrust in the police system. However, he expressed his and DPS’ availability and readiness to all students.
“In America, the police work for the people,” said Thomas. “We’re an extension of the people, whereas in other countries the police are an extension of the state.”

Kelly Lampotang hacks — and she wants to see more women take a crack at it, too.
Lampotang, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science, founded AthenaHacks after participating in hackathons her freshman year and realizing she was frequently the only female team member.
“Every single time, I was always the only girl on my hackathon teams,” she said. “The friends that you would usually go to hackathons with were always guys. There aren’t many women in hackathons.”
Less than 20 percent of hackathon attendees are women, according to Lady Problems Hakathon, an organization that examines issues regarding women in technology. A hackathon features developers of varying skill levels banding together to cultivate technology solutions to issues in everyday life.
After attending an all-female hackathon in the Bay Area, Lampotang was inspired to host one for Southern California and expand the idea of an all-female hackathon to the region.
“I expected it to be really great, but it was not as great as it could have been,” Lampotang said. “I wanted to make something for SoCal that was as great as a real hackathon, but also all females.” 
Fellow Viterbi undergraduates Catherine Chung, Ilona Bodnar, Sampurna Basu and Yingyu Sun joined Lampotang as the five co-founders of AthenaHacks. They then recruited 10 other women to help plan the event and work toward their mission of supporting and nurturing women in tech.
Yingyu Sun, a sophomore majoring in computer science, is one of the five founding females of AthenaHacks. She also recognized the need for such an event to take place.
“This is something that’s pretty rare,” she said. “There aren’t a lot of all-female hackathons in the country even.” 
In addition to hosting the hackathon, AthenaHacks will host a slew of skill-building, social and professional workshops for all who identify as female. According to Lampotang, the workshops range from introduction to programming to advanced skills and technical specialty workshops; however, they are normally for beginners.
“These are usually geared towards people who haven’t been to a hackathon before,” Lampotang said. “Find something that you want to work on, gain some basic knowledge, then go in with your actual team and build something from what you learn.”
Sun also said she wanted AthenaHacks to focus on beginner’s workshops. 
“Hackathons can be pretty scary to start, especially if it’s your first time,” she said. “What we really want AthenaHacks to be is a way for beginners to learn more about what they can do and have that support system there for them to do what they want to.” 
 Corporations such as Facebook will send representatives and host a workshop. Others, like Zynga, will sponsor prizes.
 Marsela Sulku, a sophomore majoring in computer science, stated that the accessibility of companies surprised her.
 “It’s cool to know how connected we are,” she said. “It opened my eyes.”
 According to Lampotang, a diverse array of companies were willing to help.
 “A lot of companies are excited about the idea [of having] an all-female hackathon for the diversity aspects,” she said. “And I think that they recognize that there’s a huge imbalance right now in how many women currently attend hackathons.” 
 Sulku and Sun both acknowledge that they have seen this imbalance recently. They were the only two girls in a group of six for a group project.
 “I think people use girls in tech almost as a token of diversity,” Sun said. “But I think there’s more to that than just having them be there. People need to realize that we’re not just there to make things diverse.” 
 Sun credits faculty and staff from USC for helping bring the vision to life and rallying for their cause.
 “People are really responsive, and if they can’t do anything, they’ll forward us to someone else,” she said. “It’s nice to know that people out there care.” 
 The hackathon will also be providing free feminine products and donating money to local women-centric charities in the hackathon’s winners’ names.
 “I think AthenaHacks provides an area where everyone’s on the same boat,” Sulku said. “It’s the first step to feeling more comfortable in this industry, which is important.”
 AthenaHacks will be held from April 8 to 9. In addition to undergraduate and graduate students, high school girls are also eligible to participate.
 “The whole goal is to get more women to go to [AthenaHacks],” Lampotang said. “Maybe they’ll see that it’s a good environment, be less intimidated by the whole thing and go to more hackathons.”
