After defeating Cal in overtime on Thursday, the Trojans suffered their first loss of the season to Stanford in overtime on Sunday afternoon, losing 0-1.
The Trojans didn’t survive overtime on Sunday afternoon, and the game against No. 1 Stanford ended in heartbreak for the Trojans as they lost 1-0, courtesy of a goal by freshman forward Sophia Smith.
McAlpine made a risky move to start the game with senior forward Leah Pruitt and redshirt sophomore Savannah DeMelo on the bench. The pair bolsters the offensive attack, combining for 11 goals and 10 assists over the first 10 games of the season.
Even after Pruitt and DeMelo joined the action, it was obvious by the half that Stanford was the better team. Within the first few minutes of the second half, the Cardinal created many dangerous chances that were either put wide or saved by redshirt sophomore keeper Kaylie Collins, who made three key saves and fended off 22 shots from Stanford. 
The Cardinal looked dangerous in both the offensive third and the midfield and controlled the game in the second half. While the defense kept players like sophomore forward Catarina Macario off the score sheet, the Cardinal continued to apply widespread pressure.
As the game approached the end of regulation, the Cardinal created two chances from corner kicks that they nearly put away in the last minute of the game. Going into overtime, they took full advantage of the built momentum. Eventually, the Cardinal were able to score off a break away, and finish the game 1-0.
Three days earlier, the Trojans took on unranked Cal on Thursday afternoon, and managed to claim a late 1-0 win, courtesy of junior midfielder Ashleigh Plumptre’s corner kick in overtime.
“This game was a little bit of a struggle for us honestly. We weren’t playing the way we wanted to,” Plumptre said about the Cal game. “When we came off at the end, when we knew we had to go into overtime, we knew that we weren’t playing our best, but it’s about digging it out when there’s game like this. And I think that’s exactly what we did and it kind of showed in the goal. It was a bit of a scrappy goal, but we just tried to put our body on the line.”
USC managed to claim 25 shots within the game, but only forced four saves from Cal’s keeper. While the Trojans claimed a majority of possession throughout the game, specifically in the second half, it wasn’t the performance they were looking for against the Golden Bears. Both teams like to play possession based in the midfield, and despite the depth of the Trojans’ talent, they struggled to maintain control of Thursday’s game. 
“When you have a day like today where you don’t play that well and you find a way to win you have to be thankful for that,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said after the game. “But it wasn’t to the standard of the way we like to play and what we want to do. Yes, we had a lot of possession there in the second half; yes, we created chances. But we didn’t play with the rhythm and tempo, or even some of the thought process that was necessary to win the game.”
The Trojans look to bounce back from this loss next week with games against Arizona and Arizona State on Thursday and Sunday, respectively.

In his postgame radio interview on 710 ESPN on Saturday after USC hung on to beat Arizona 24-20 in Tucson, it didn’t take long for head coach Clay Helton to utter the words, “control our destiny.”
He did it last season ad nauseam, to the point that writers placed bets in the press box as to how many times Helton would use that phrase in his postgame interview — which means that no matter how bad things may seem, USC is still in position to win the Pac-12 South. It’s one of the many cliches that clutter Helton’s press conferences, and it would be accurate to characterize him as a coach who sees the glass as half full, no matter the circumstances.
To be fair, Helton admitted to not being satisfied with how the Trojans finished Saturday’s contest. With a 24-0 second half lead, USC shot itself in the foot with turnovers, penalties and poor decision-making, allowing Arizona and its hobbled quarterback, Khalil Tate, to come dangerously close to making a comeback. 
Nobody in the locker room seemed particularly happy, like freshman quarterback JT Daniels: “You can’t be too mad when you get a win, but I’m pretty mad. We can do better. And I guess that’s a positive, [because] we’re nowhere near our potential.”
Or redshirt sophomore wide receiver Tyler Vaughns: “I’m not happy for [the win] because I know we should’ve done better.”
Or senior linebacker Cam Smith: “I think we just haven’t put a complete game together, and we’re due.”
But still — “control our destiny.” Mhmm.
The thing is, though, his words actually ring true. With a 2-1 conference record, the Trojans do control their own destiny. They can play exactly like they did on Saturday — exceptional at times, terribly at others — and roll through a weak Pac-12 South. Of its six remaining conference games, USC is projected by ESPN’s Football Power Index to win all but one of them, with Oct. 20’s road game at Utah the only toss up. 
The Trojans get Colorado, Arizona State and Cal at home. They’ll play Utah, Oregon State and UCLA on the road. None of these teams match USC’s talent. None of them have USC’s playmakers. If the Trojans show up to these games with a half-decent game plan, they can finish 8-1 in the Pac-12 and undefeated in the South. Whether or not playoff contender Notre Dame blows them out in the regular season finale has no impact on a potential Pac-12 Championship berth. 
This is why this football program is as promising as it is infuriating. The Trojans can be so much more than a team that merely beats up on inferior competition, so much better than a team that escapes Tucson with a win that should have never been in doubt, yet was in jeopardy up until they recovered an onside kick late in regulation.
Nobody questions the skill. Look at how composed Daniels seemed, as an 18-year-old starting quarterback. Look at how explosive senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware was on the ground, rushing for two touchdowns and 173 yards. Look at how the defense shut down the dynamic Tate and Arizona’s rushing attack, which entered the game leading the Pac-12 with an average of 247.2 yards per game but was held to 98 yards on Saturday.
And yet, the Trojans barely clawed out the win to inch a game above .500 on the season, and they remain unranked for the third straight week. 
This can be better. It should be better. Being able to “control our destiny” shouldn’t be the goal; it should be a given. If USC wins the rest of its conference games but is blown out by Notre Dame to end the regular season, all that means is the Trojans won the games they should have won only to lose a game that would have actually meant something bigger than just controlling their destiny. 
Instead of measuring USC against Pac-12 competition, Helton should be looking at the non-conference results. Since 2016, the Trojans have suffered blowout losses to Alabama, Texas and Ohio State, with the 2017 Rose Bowl win over Penn State the lone statement out-of-conference victory in the Helton era. 
But USC might reach the Rose Bowl this season anyway without having to prove itself. All the Trojans have to do is beat mediocre competition the next six games, and then come up on top against presumably Stanford or Washington in the Pac-12 Championship.
So yes, Helton is right: USC does control its own destiny, and it could be enough to keep everyone happy this season. But that is frustrating in itself.

Redshirt freshman Velus Jones goes airborne to make a catch in Saturday’s game against the Wildcats in Arizona. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
USC held off a late push by Arizona to defeat the Wildcats 24-20 on Saturday in Tucson. The victory extended the Trojans’ record to 3-2 overall and 2-1 in the Pac-12. 
The Trojans had a 24-0 lead, but Arizona reeled off 20 consecutive points to draw closer in the fourth quarter. A touchdown with under two minutes drew the Wildcats within 4 points, and USC recovered an onside kick to close out the game.
Freshman quarterback JT Daniels was 16-of-24 passing for 197 yards, while Arizona’s junior quarterback Khalil Tate’s was 16-of-33 passing for 232 yards. 
Penalties (once again) plagued the Trojans as the team committed 18 penalties totalling 169 yards.
“There was a lot of yellow on both sides from both teams,” head coach Clay Helton said. “It was one of those nights. The things that I’m going to point out to the team are some of the decision-making things. 
USC’s first score came from a solid mixture of receivers to spark the passing game. Daniels completed passes to three different receivers, including tossing a 37-yard pass to sophomore tight end Josh Falo for a total of 80 passing yards on a 12-play, 90-yard drive. The reception was notable as USC does not typically target tight ends offensively.
In the first half, the Trojans were successful on key plays, converting three of five third down attempts while holding the Wildcats to just one of four conversions. On the other hand, USC failed to reconcile its preventable penalty issue from the Washington State game. The Trojans were penalized nine times for 95 yards in the first half alone. One of the fouls, a holding call, negated what would have been a large gain for sophomore running back Stephen Carr.
Solid defensive pressure led to a turnover in favorable field position for USC. Senior linebacker Porter Gustin’s pressure on Tate on a play action forced a throw into the hands of senior safety Marvell Tell III. The Trojans were unsuccessful in breaking into the red zone and settled for a career-long 42-yard field goal by redshirt sophomore Michael Brown to extend the Trojans’ lead to 10-0. 
Perhaps the biggest improvement for the team was the diversification of receiving targets. Daniels had five receptions to freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown for 54 yards, two receptions each to redshirt sophomore wide receiver Velus Jones Jr. and redshirt sophomore wide receiver Tyler Vaughns for 22 and 23 yards, respectively. This marked a stark contrast to past games in which Daniels focused on one receiver, usually St. Brown, for the bulk of  his targets. The offense also experimented with targeting tight ends, which aided in the offense’s passing success. 
“I think [getting comfortable with more receivers] is a big positive for us,” Daniels said. “We’re getting better and better throwing the ball.” 
The second half kept the ball rolling for the Trojans. On its first drive of the second half, USC extended its lead to 24-0 when senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware rushed 69 yards into the end zone. He ran for 176 yards on 21 carries for two touchdowns on the night. 
“The O-line did their thing,” Ware said. “They opened up holes and I just ran through them.” 
The Wildcats’ first score came in the third quarter, and it was Tate’s first showing of the game. He led his team 84 yards in seven plays for a touchdown to narrow the Trojans’ lead to 24-7. The Wildcats’ next scoring drive didn’t come until midway through the fourth quarter. Following a turnover via a fumble by Daniels, Arizona found the end zone on its first play when Tate slung a 32-yard completion to redshirt junior receiver Cedric Peterson. 
Arizona’s last drive ended with its third and final touchdown of the night late in the fourth after taking multiple stabs at the end zone from the red zone at the goal line. The Wildcats narrowed the Trojans lead to 24-20, the final score of the match up.
Heading into the bye week, there is a definite need among the team to improve on its recurring flaws.
“Helton came up to me after and said, ‘We really gotta go. These next two weeks are big for us,’” senior linebacker Cam Smith said. “And I said, ‘Hey coach, we’ve gotta have a sense of urgency.’ And that’s what we’ve been communicating a lot about, and we’re all working together. These don’t feel great, but at the end it’s a win and I’m happy we have it.” 
Following its week off, USC will welcome Colorado at the Coliseum on Oct. 13.

Canadian folk singer Bahamas performed at The Theatre at Ace Hotel Friday evening. (Photo from Instagram)
On Friday, Bahamas brought his indie folk-inspired music to The Theatre at Ace Hotel,   fostering an uplifting energy among audience members through his charming melodies about love and loss.
Bahamas, whose birth name is Afie Jurvanen, swayed the sold out crowd with his banter about “Canadian-ness” and his favorite La Croix flavor.
Bahamas kept his performance simple in every aspect. Dressed in earthy tones (alluding to his latest album “Earthtones”), Bahamas and his band’s outfits proved that they were purely focused on musicality, while the sparse stage ensured that the spotlight remained on the music.
Bahamas and touring artist Christine Bougie traded lead moments on guitar on rock songs like “No Expectations” and the country-influenced “Can’t Take You With Me.” Backed by vocalist Felicity Williams, the harmonies were especially gratifying on “Lost in Light” and “No Wrong.”
It would be wrong to simply classify Williams as a background singer, as her notes were soaring and instrumentally resounding. “Opening Act (The Shooby Dooby Song)” brought fans back to music of 1970s bands Allman Brothers Band and Elvin Bishop Group.  
On certain tunes, Bahamas’ sound was also reminiscent of country rock. 
Bahamas’ eras and genres of influence were apparent, yet his music still original. Compared to other indie artists that make use of electronic elements in music production, Bahamas relies solely on vocal and instrumental skills, harkening back to popular styles of the past, without sounding outdated.
The setlist spanned his entire discography, as far back as his debut 2009 album “Pink Strat.” Bahamas mostly played from “Earthtones,” but received an especially warm reception with the opening tune, “Lost in Light” from his 2012 album “Barchords.” The haunting opening plucks of the guitar set off instant cheers from the crowd. Mid-song, Bahamas and Williams harmonized on the line “leaving me on my own,”  before Williams’ haunting, wordless solo. 
At times, the crowd got a bit unruly, with questions and requests to which Bahamas responded: “I like that we’re in the Q&A portion of the concert.” 
He then reminded the audience with a smile, “Now guys, I’m in charge.” 
The show’s spontaneity kept the performance lively. Midway through the set, an audience member yelled out, “Chattahoochee,” referring to a spur-of-the-moment cover Bahamas posted on his YouTube channel. 
Bahamas took a comedic pause. “Are there any aspiring musicians out there?” he asked, laughing. “I have a word of advice: Don’t put anything on the internet.”
Overall, the beauty of this concert stemmed from its authenticity. Bahamas played his truth on stage, generating real emotion from the audience in return. There were no screens, video nor fancy graphics to distract from the music. Bahamas’ show stirred a sentiment of returning to the basics with music that comes from the heart.

Leo Xia, who graduated in 2017 with a degree in industrial and systems engineering, says the inspiration for his new album stems from his grandmother’s passing earlier this year. (Jessica Ma | Daily Trojan)
This past Saturday, USC alumnus Leo Xia hosted an album release party for his sophomore album “384” in Downtown Los Angeles for fans and family.
Although he received a bachelor’s degree in industrial and systems engineering in 2017, Xia has been pursuing music as a career since graduation. Since then, he has co-hosted the podcast “Now, Pour The Tea,” had his songs featured on Buzzfeed and performed at events hosted by Asian American groups around the Los Angeles area.
Before the show, attendees mingled around the lounge and some congratulated Xia on his album release, while others caught up with old friends. Xia said he was just glad that his friends and listeners  were there to support him and share in the experience.
“I know a lot of my close friends are coming today and people that have never seen me perform, too,” Xia said. “I’m just happy that I can experience music — at the end of the day we have music as humans and that’s so amazing.”
To start the evening, Xia invited an impressive lineup of artists to perform before him. From content creator Chris Lam, who used to work for Buzzfeed Video, to spoken-word artist and USC alumnus Alex Luu, who spoke about Asian and immigrant struggles, these performers impressed and moved the audience.
Xia’s inspiration for producing “384” stemmed from the passing of his grandmother who he had a strong bond with.
“Five months ago, my grandma, or my laolao, passed away, and she was the one that taught me Chinese growing up,” Xia said. “So I’ve had other grandparents pass away, but I wasn’t affected as much. But this one really hit me.”
After Xia traveled to China right after his grandmother’s passing and visited his childhood home, he was overwhelmed with emotion. These feelings originally only existed in the form of random notes on a phone notepad, but soon became more than that, he said.
“I wasn’t even writing songs at first — it was just like notes on my phone, like thoughts like how you would write an article. Just for me, eventually that turns to a song and everything moved really quickly from there,” he said.
His grief morphed into songs on “384.” Surrounded by a crowd of about 50 people at the release party, Xia explained the origins of each song that he wrote.
“Keep,” the third song on “384,” had nostalgic undertones, and was written from the point of view of a parent watching their child leave home after caring for them for their whole lives. “Will you remember me when you go flying free, what can I keep?” he sang. 
“Sliced Fruit,” on the other hand, took the act of cutting fruit for a loved one into a song about a parent’s unconditional love. Each song emphasized relations between family members in a different way and allowed the audience to reach a higher appreciation for family.
As for what he wanted people to take away from his album, Xia stressed the importance of maintaining good social and familial relations.
“I appreciate my family members so much more now … Like you see your parents not as invincible, but they were children once too,” Xia said. “So I think in that sense, kind of like treasuring the people around you, not necessarily just family but like friends too.”
Another important message Xia hoped to convey was self-forgiveness.
“I feel like the message is also like don’t beat yourself up about what you haven’t done well in the past,” Xia said. “Guilt doesn’t accomplish anything unless it’s transformed into action of some kind, and I was lucky I had my grandmother, who would come from the city to teach me Chinese on the weekends. So when you flip it instead of a sadness about loss, make it into gratitude for what was.”
On Saturday night, Xia felt grateful. Amid the cheers after the end of his final song, Xia bowed with a large smile on his face.

If you’ve followed the news at all this past week, you are all too familiar with Brett Kavanaugh. The controversial Supreme Court nominee became a symbol for every woman’s worst fear when Dr. Christine Blasey Ford came forward with allegations of sexual assault against him. From his initial denials to the testimony he gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kavanaugh has exemplified the length to which some men will go to control and discredit women. 
When the allegation first came forward, I felt with every fiber of my being that he would not be confirmed. I believed beyond a shadow of a doubt that in the current culture of #MeToo, he would be the latest in a long line of publicly ousted abusers. I thought that more women would inevitably come forward with allegations, and the Senate would absolutely do the right thing by sending him packing. 
Still, I did a good job distancing myself from the testimonies. My schedule required me to commit energy elsewhere, and I couldn’t risk the emotional drainage of keeping up with Kavanaugh. If I let curiosity get the best of me, I would have gotten caught up in the proceedings and spent too much time dwelling upon them.
The next day, the judiciary committee voted along party lines to go through with the confirmation proceedings. An FBI probe was announced soon after, but it didn’t lessen the initial sting of the news. This time, I wasn’t so careful. On Twitter, I scrolled past sad and angry women trying to grapple with their disbelief, and I got stuck. I told myself that pushing the vote would mean ousting Kavanaugh that much sooner. Then I could go back to believing in a political system concerned with truth instead of agenda. 
Before long, I gave up. An all-too-familiar gnawing feeling ate at my stomach — the same one that grabbed me during Hurricane Maria and the first wave of President Donald Trump’s travel bans. It was the same hollow feeling that sat on my diaphragm when I lay in bed refreshing the computer screen, praying it would eventually display a different outcome to the 2016 presidential election. This black goop in my belly reduced my emotional state to a vague sorrow, and served as a constant reminder that all was not right in my America. 
So I turned to the only thing I could control. I took out my ear buds, opened up the Spotify app and transported my body into the world of Regina Spektor. I settled on listening to “The Grand Hotel,” a place Spektor describes as hiding the entrance to hell. In the song, she talks about mythical times, when devils would emerge from the basement and fill the world with terror. Now they’re too tired to eat souls, content to hang out with the humans on the dance floor instead. Hiding their horns under hats, they look for comfort and a good time.
Maybe I particularly liked the song that day because I needed to believe people could change, even if it’s instigated by fatigue instead of moral courage. Kavanaugh throwing a tantrum in front of a national audience or 11 U.S. Senators voting to speed up his confirmation makes this sentiment seem naive. There’s no sense of justice or exhaustion — just a bunch of angry, affluent men too stubborn to entertain the light. More often than not, people do the bad thing when it’s obvious what choosing good is. People who start off choosing wrong keep at it, confining icy hearts to the tall-tales and happy fictions.
Perhaps I need to accept that the world is more like “The Trapper and the Furrier” on the same album. The men in this song separate animals from their mothers, take advantage of dying patients and overwork employees in pursuit of profit. 
“What a strange, strange world we live in,” Spektor sings, “where the good are damned and the wicked forgiven.” 
Despite how appropriate the song was in light of my feelings, I skipped it. I didn’t need to have those words ingrained into me, confirming my belief that the world really is broken beyond repair. For every day when Kavanaugh gives his testimony, there are more where I see people speaking out and trying to do right by others. 
For every time I feel hopeless, there are more when I am lifted up by the people I love. For every realist bent on making America bleak again, there are plenty of starry-eyed romantics and naive dreamers to remind us there is still good to be had. 
Even if I can’t see past the dark right now, soon I’ll be back to my ignorant bliss and putting faith in our ability to do the right thing. Until then, I’ll check into the Grand Hotel and dance with semi-retired ghouls until I drop. When I wake up to a new day, I’ll believe again.

On Thursday, commentator and provocateur Ben Shapiro will speak at Bovard Auditorium. The past few weeks have seen mixed reactions rippling across campus, ranging from fierce defenses of discourse on a college campus to warnings from students about the implications and dangers of Shapiro’s platform. The Trojan Advocates for Political Progress believe the presentation of such a speaker under the guise of free speech and discourse to be not only intellectually dishonest and morally bankrupt, but also dangerous to marginalized and vulnerable groups here at USC and in the surrounding community.
As our fellow students and allied organizations across campus continue to spread the word and sound the alarm, we are often met with surprise that we take offense at this so-called moderate speaker on our campus. Though many of Shapiro’s stances are cemented within the context of the modern conservative movement, we take issue not only with his half-truths and deceptions, but also with his demeanor, falsehoods and rhetoric, all of which invalidate the experiences and struggles of marginalized populations. Ultimately, Shapiro hides behind the facade of moderate politics while espousing hateful and dangerous lies.
In a world where, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, “scientific evidence for warming of the climate system is unequivocal,” and on a campus striving to hit its 2020 Sustainability goals, Shapiro instructs us: “The idea that the Arctic ice is disappearing is nonsense” and “The earth — basically — has not been warming for the past 15 years or so.”
In a country struggling to overcome homophobia and transphobia, Shapiro refers to the legalization of gay marriage as the “the homosexual assault on traditional marriage” and to transgender people as “mentally ill.” While there are countless cultures with non-binary views of gender, he asserts “the idea that sex and gender are malleable is not true” and, “for all of human history, boy meant boy and girl meant girl” to invalidate those of such identities.
He claims that “there is no evidence of systemic discrimination against minorities” by police departments despite the fact that the Justice Department has found “‘systemic’ discrimination” by Baltimore’s police force. And while Shapiro casts former president Barack Obama as the “first Welfare Queen president,” he proclaims, “The reason people are permanently poor in the United States is not because they don’t have money — it’s because they suck with money,” despite the many studies that prove that institutional factors keep the rich rich and the poor poor.
With many of Shapiro’s ideas outdated at best and dangerous at worst, we are left to question: “What is his true purpose on this campus?” 
As the posters around campus which depict liberals as babies indicate, his supporters want to infantilize and denigrate us, rather than engage in thoughtful debate. The word “university” derives from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium, which roughly means “community of teachers and scholars.” This definition encompasses the two aims of the modern university: to tie students closer to one another, and to knowledge. Using this framework as a foundation, any speech that seeks to injure the student body’s relationship to one another and to academic inquiry ought to be challenged. The horrifyingly divisive rhetoric and lies illustrated above not only violate both the principles of community and knowledge, but also belie disingenuous appeals to logic, discourse and freedom.
Too often, many conflate opposition to Shapiro and others like him with disregard for free speech and dialogue. In the wake of the unveiling of a white supremacist on our campus, our administration told us to combat “hate speech with more speech,” in a memo. But when confronted on campus with an individual who espouses racism, transphobia, Islamophobia and falsehoods to undermine the historical struggle of marginalized groups, a question and answer period cannot suffice with student safety and well-being coming into question. At a university where we prize and respect diversity of sexual orientation, race, gender, religion and economic background, we must hold ourselves to a higher standard. 
As the title of Shapiro’s speech indicates: “Facts don’t care about your feelings.” We agree; facts don’t care about Shapiro’s feelings or his falsehoods. As an organization, we implore our fellow students and administration to avoid falling for the trap of enabling hateful and dishonest rhetoric under the pretense of free speech.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Last week, professor and research psychologist Dr. Christine Blasey Ford stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify at length, detailing her allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her 35 years ago. Attempting to conceal her terror before cameras and an audience of predominantly male senators, Ford painstakingly recounted the traumatic experience of being barricaded in a room as Kavanaugh pinned her down, covered her mouth and attempted to forcibly undress her while his friend looked on at a high school party in 1982. After being asked to identify her most vivid memory of the ordeal, Dr. Ford offered a simple yet powerful response: “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter…the uproarious laughter between the two. They’re having fun at my expense.”
Having studied the human mind for decades, Ford knows a lot about the hippocampus, a structure in the brain responsible for regulating emotions and consolidating memory. As she puts it, “Trauma-related experience is locked there… other memories just drift.”
The trauma sexual assault survivors face can stay with them for a lifetime. It’s not uncommon for survivors, over time, to be able to move on, build families, redefine themselves and maybe even begin to speak up after their experience as Ford has: But, sexual assault could remain a part of them forever. 
According to Mental Health America, sexual assault survivors are at an increased risk of developing depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders and substance abuse habits.
If Kavanaugh did, in fact, assault Ford, it’s entirely possible that he is being honest about having no memory of what he did to Ford. Sexual violence against women has long been such a normalized part of our culture that one in five women will experience sexual assault in her lifetime, but even so, the vast majority of survivors will never report. Faced with no consequences for their actions, the majority of perpetrators are repeat offenders. A culture without accountability for those who hurt — those who abuse and instill lifelong trauma in their victims — is one in which sexual assault is normalized and so trivialized to the point where it can be entirely forgettable to the abusers. 
Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimonies last week, along with the national attention, scrutiny and backlash Ford has shouldered, have opened up the scars of survivors across the country. The cruel treatment of Ford by some of the most powerful men in the country has elucidated exactly why so many survivors don’t report their experiences. The treatment of a woman, who has already endured so much punishment for what she alleges happened to her is now being handled as a criminal subject by senators. Ford has experienced social ostracism, academic struggles, time in therapy, marital problems and, most recently, death threats and being forced to move out of her house throughout this ordeal. This is a reminder to survivors of the backlash they may face upon coming forward.
In the last week, the National Sexual Assault hotline saw a 201 percent increase in calls as survivors watched their worst fears and lived experiences play out before the eyes of the nation. They were told by the president and leading U.S. senators that if they did not immediately report their experiences to law enforcement, despite how many survivors cite fear of intimidation and blame from police as a reason they don’t report, then they are not credible. They were called “con-artists” by the most powerful man in the nation at a press conference last week. All of this hatred and cruelty, after all that they’ve already suffered, fell on their shoulders. Given the trauma they’ve already experienced, that’s not right.
At this time, the burden of speaking up, standing up and declaring unequivocally that what’s happening is unacceptable and unjust can’t fall solely on the shoulders of women and survivors. As a man who has never experienced sexual assault, I can only try to imagine the pain, trauma and isolation survivors have felt throughout their journeys — certainly while watching what’s happening. But I understand my moral obligation to stand with them, and refuse to subject them to the cruelty of going through this alone. 
As Ford could attest as a decorated psychology professor and researcher of trauma-related issues, the impact of sexual assault on mental health is deep and long-lasting. We can no longer allow manipulative, dangerous narratives that portray men accused of sexual assault as victims to distract from the traumatic harm that sexual assault subjects survivors to. We have to take her powerful testimony and brave choice to speak before the nation as a lesson: Coming forward is often a thankless, dangerous experience for survivors, who typically sacrifice their mental health and comfort to support others. We cannot force them to go through this alone.

SparkSC hosted its second annual women’s makeathon this weekend where students competed in groups and learned about the product design process. (Photo courtesy of Jules Nash)
SparkSC hosted USC’s second all-women makeathon this weekend at The Reef in Downtown Los Angeles. During the two days of “Break to Make,” students competed in groups  to enhance their knowledge in hardware technology. 
“Even though it sounds really technical, the weekend is more about being hands-on and making an idea come to life,” event co-coordinator Mimi Tran Zambetti said. 
While the first makeathon was held at Wallis Annenberg Hall, Tran Zambetti wanted to experiment with the location to make the event more like a retreat away from USC. To ensure that transportation was not a barrier to attendance, SparkSC partnered with Lyft to give participants free rides. 
The weekend consisted of learning about the product design process or “ideation,” prototyping with Arduino, an open-source computer hardware, and pitching projects to a panel of judges from venture funds. Teams of three or four came up with solutions for two issues: reducing food waste and improving educational engagement. The teams also had the option of an “open design,” where they identified a problem in their community and prototyped a solution. 
Holly Huber, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering, and Kristie Leung, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering, worked to tackle the challenge of food waste by focusing on farmer-produced waste. 
Their team found that 60 percent of produce is thrown away because of its “ugliness,” and were inspired by a cultural tradition of growing square watermelons in Japan. In addition to reducing waste, their product featured an acrylic coating protection from bugs and an ability to save fuel by shipping greater volumes more efficiently.
Leung said the hardest part of the procedure was settling on an idea and coming up with designs for the box.
“It sounds like a simple task, but [the hardest part was] trying to figure out the best way to make the box and make it sturdy, adjustable and thinking creatively in a way that’s applicable,” Leung said. 
Lena Tavitian, who also helped coordinate the event, emphasized that all female-identifying students were welcome to participate in the event. Tran Zambetti’s idea to organize “Break To Make” in such way stems from her personal experience building robots at an all-girls high school. Once Tran Zambetti came to USC, she realized the entrepreneurial community was predominantly male. Tran Zambetti decided to pursue this makeathon to break down gender stereotypes in the STEM field and to introduce maker culture to budding female engineers. 
“It’s been a really fantastic experience,” Huber said. “I think ‘Break to Make’ is unique among these sorts of design competitions, and it’s a very collaborative environment. I felt like it was less of it being a competition, and more of an opportunity for people to work in a very collaborative, innovative space.”

The Viterbi Career Center will change the structure of its career fair after receiving a flood of student complaints over a proposed lottery-style format once results came out. (Daily Trojan file photo)
The Viterbi Career Center will reverse changes made to the Viterbi Career Fair’s structure after students voiced complaints, according to a Sept. 28 email to engineering students. 
The intended changes would have blocked off an estimated 20 high-volume companies and only allowed students selected from a lottery process to speak with the companies. 
“We listened to your feedback about access to Alumni Park during the Viterbi Career & Internship Fair,” the email stated. “Access to Alumni Park will be the same as the general fair — open to all Viterbi students.”
To apply for the lottery, engineering students would have been required to upload their resumes to VMock, a career platform provided by USC. If the student’s resume achieved a score of 70 percent or higher based on an algorithm, they would be allowed to enter the drawing. 
After last week’s lottery drawing on Sept. 27, students voiced their disappointment about not being selected for the “high-volume” companies.
Initially, the center restructured this year’s fair to mitigate the long lines, after many students complained about the lengthy wait times in previous years.
“It was always exhausting, even the times that I devoted my whole day to it, it was like I would stand in line for a couple hours and spend 30 seconds talking to a recruiter,” said Reed Barnes, a junior majoring in computer science.
These common complaints came to the attention of the Viterbi Career Center through feedback surveys in response to past years’ career fairs. 
“[The new format was] actually based off of several years of survey results, both from the student perspective and from the employer perspective,” said Kaitlin Harada, director of Student Engagement and Career Connections.
While the new format aimed to address previous complaints, students were wary of its potential to reduce contact with certain employers. 
“There are going to be a lot of deserving candidates left out because it’s a lottery-based system,” said Robert Vigil, a junior majoring in civil engineering.
Since computer science students form a significant majority of the engineering student population, a random drawing would have allowed far more computer science students into Alumni Park. Other engineering majors would have had significantly less representation, even though for many of them, these selective employers may be their best chance at securing a job the following summer.
“For [non-computer science majors], if one of their high volume employers gets locked behind this fence, their chances are, by default, going to be worse because they are not a computer science student,” Barnes said. 
Since the Viterbi Career Center has already decided to reverse the upcoming fair’s structure, students will have to continue facing long lines and wait times to meet with recruiters.

School of Social Work graduate student Vanessa Castellanos is planning the fourth annual “No Más Clinic” to provide free legal consultations and other services to local residents. (Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan)
As a long-time South L.A. resident, Vanessa Castellanos always wanted to give back to her community. 
A graduate student in her final year at the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and the co-community representative for the Latinx Student Caucus, Castellanos serves as the main planner for the fourth annual “No Más Clinic,” an event that provides free legal consultations and other resources to local residents each spring. 
In previous years, the event was held at USC in a conference format in which community members rotated classrooms to learn about topics within Latinx communities. However, Castellanos said the conference schedule didn’t work well for residents who had to work or take care of children. 
This year, she aims to make the event a drop-in style clinic with legal consultations and nonprofits available all day to talk with community members about their rights and various resources available to them. 
Castellanos and her team are currently working to find an off-campus space to host the event, which she believes will be more inviting to the community. 
“We feel like, as social workers, we want to meet clients or meet community members where they are, and I think sometimes making it too academic-focused we may lose the community in that,” Castellanos said. “We want to make it more practical, easier to understand, easier to navigate.”
USC alumna Mirian Juarez helped organize the “No Más” event last spring. She worked closely with Castellanos last year and continues to consult with her today. 
Even though Castellanos was not yet a board member in the caucus, Juarez said she got involved in planning the event early on and wanted to learn from the current leaders. Juarez said Castellanos also showed a passion for the community and strong networking skills with students, community organizers and politicians.
“It was very clear to everyone on the board that she was the perfect person for [community representative] not only because she put in the time for the whole previous year, but she also demonstrated a lot of the skills you need for this,” Juarez said. 
As an undergraduate student at UCLA, Castellanos said she often felt a sense of imposter syndrome because she didn’t see many students who looked like her. But Castellanos said joining the Lambda Theta Alpha Latin sorority helped her find other Latina students and reconnect with her desire to help her community. 
Castellanos is currently applying to doctoral programs in urban planning, and said she hopes to use her knowledge of Latinx communities to shape policy in areas like South L.A. Castellanos said she also wants to be a role model for Latinos to push past challenges and pursue careers in academia. During the 2011-2012 academic year, 5 percent of doctoral degree earners were Latinx, according to A National Education Blueprint. 
“In academia, [Latinos] are very underrepresented … I want to be a part in encouraging those numbers to go up and show that we are here, we are present in academia,” Castellanos said. 
Eliane Fersan, director of the Initiative on Immigrants and Global Migration, has met with Castellanos and other students to talk about ways to further improve “No Más” and facilitate contact with outside resources and leaders. 
Fersan thinks Castellanos will create change for Latinx communities through policy and education because of her persistence and drive. 
“She knows how to get into the system and break it from the inside,” Fersan said. “She’s a woman with a plan. She knows what she’s doing. She knows what it takes. She knows it’s hard and tough, and it’s going to take time and sweat and she’s doing it.”
Castellanos said her family and community have inspired her to continue pursuing her goals. After earning her doctorate, she plans to give back by doing more research on Latinx communities, advocating for new policies and educating the next generation of students to continue this work.
“This is for my family, my parents specifically, who have endured so many challenges on giving us a better future,” Castellanos said. “I really want to make sure that I take advantage of everything that they did not have and be that role model. So, that is important to me because it’s not only something for myself, it’s something for my family and for ultimately my people and my community.”
This story is part of a mini-series highlighting Latinos at USC. It will run every Monday during Hispanic Heritage Month, which ends Oct. 15.

After defeating Cal in overtime on Thursday, the Trojans suffered their first loss of the season to Stanford in overtime on Sunday afternoon, losing 0-1.
The Trojans didn’t survive overtime on Sunday afternoon, and the game against No. 1 Stanford ended in heartbreak for the Trojans as they lost 1-0, courtesy of a goal by freshman forward Sophia Smith.

McAlpine made a risky move to start the game with senior forward Leah Pruitt and redshirt sophomore Savannah DeMelo on the bench. The pair bolsters the offensive attack, combining for 11 goals and 10 assists over the first 10 games of the season.
Even after Pruitt and DeMelo joined the action, it was obvious by the half that Stanford was the better team. Within the first few minutes of the second half, the Cardinal created many dangerous chances that were either put wide or saved by redshirt sophomore keeper Kaylie Collins, who made three key saves and fended off 22 shots from Stanford. 
The Cardinal looked dangerous in both the offensive third and the midfield and controlled the game in the second half. While the defense kept players like sophomore forward Catarina Macario off the score sheet, the Cardinal continued to apply widespread pressure.
As the game approached the end of regulation, the Cardinal created two chances from corner kicks that they nearly put away in the last minute of the game. Going into overtime, they took full advantage of the built momentum. Eventually, the Cardinal were able to score off a break away, and finish the game 1-0.
Three days earlier, the Trojans took on unranked Cal on Thursday afternoon, and managed to claim a late 1-0 win, courtesy of junior midfielder Ashleigh Plumptre’s corner kick in overtime.
“This game was a little bit of a struggle for us honestly. We weren’t playing the way we wanted to,” Plumptre said about the Cal game. “When we came off at the end, when we knew we had to go into overtime, we knew that we weren’t playing our best, but it’s about digging it out when there’s game like this. And I think that’s exactly what we did and it kind of showed in the goal. It was a bit of a scrappy goal, but we just tried to put our body on the line.”
USC managed to claim 25 shots within the game, but only forced four saves from Cal’s keeper. While the Trojans claimed a majority of possession throughout the game, specifically in the second half, it wasn’t the performance they were looking for against the Golden Bears. Both teams like to play possession based in the midfield, and despite the depth of the Trojans’ talent, they struggled to maintain control of Thursday’s game. 
“When you have a day like today where you don’t play that well and you find a way to win you have to be thankful for that,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said after the game. “But it wasn’t to the standard of the way we like to play and what we want to do. Yes, we had a lot of possession there in the second half; yes, we created chances. But we didn’t play with the rhythm and tempo, or even some of the thought process that was necessary to win the game.”
The Trojans look to bounce back from this loss next week with games against Arizona and Arizona State on Thursday and Sunday, respectively.
