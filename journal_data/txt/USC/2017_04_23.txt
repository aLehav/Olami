On any given day, Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni can be mentoring and counseling students, conducting a religious ceremony, teaching a class or even writing articles for CNN and the Huffington Post.
A lawyer, a radio show host, an entrepreneur, a professor and a hardcore Clippers fan, Soni has never let himself be pigeonholed into one career or way of life.
Born in India and raised in California, Soni has worked as dean of religious life at USC since 2008 and holds five degrees from institutions, including Tufts University, Harvard University and the University of California, Los Angeles. His responsibilities as dean encompass an array of counseling, religious, community-building and academic programs and activities to serve one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse colleges in the United States.
“On our campus, we have over 90 student religious groups,” Soni said. “That’s more than any other American university,” Soni said. “We have over 50 chaplains representing every faith tradition … the largest group of chaplains working at any American university, and we’re in Los Angeles, which is the most religiously diverse city in the world.”
While his days are often fully booked coordinating pastoral care, speaking at ceremonial events, teaching classes and conducting public programs and community service activities, Soni said that the dynamic nature of his position is exciting, keeping him on his toes.
“There’s never a dull moment, honestly, in my job,” Soni said.
In spite of Soni’s impressive academic and professional background, however, he often reflects on how unconventional his career path has been, and how unlikely it was to be selected for the position as a Hindu.
“I don’t have a similar background as most people in this role,” Soni said. “When I was hired in 2008, I was the only non-Christian in the United States to be the chief religious or spiritual leader of a secular American university, and I was the first Hindu to ever have that role. I’m still the only Hindu, and there’s just a few of us now who are not Christian.” 
One of Soni’s major goals has been to create an inclusive, environment for students of all beliefs, not just students who associate with religious traditions.
“A growing number of students on our campus are not affiliated with religion,” Soni said. “Many students will say that they’re more spiritual than religious, and some are completely secular, and I want to be a resource for them too. So instead of orienting our office and work around God, we’ve oriented it around meaning, purpose and significance, and the things that make us human.”
Soni has noticed that in the past two generations, the American religious landscape has changed drastically as fewer and fewer people identify as religious.
“Even if students formally leave religion, or they weren’t raised with it, they still should have opportunities to think about the big questions in their life … to think about their morality and ethics,” Soni said. “They should still be building community and cultivating a sense of wonder, awe and gratitude … but they may have to do this in a different context.”
Soni also wants to design programming and events that are groundbreaking and innovative in an effort to position USC as a campus known for its forward-thinking religious life.
“We’re really trying to think about what religion will look like in 10 years in higher education, and be that office,” Soni said.
Soni’s grandfather, who lived in India, spent a significant amount of time with leader and activist Mahatma Gandhi, and shared these experiences with Soni when he was a young man. According to Soni, these stories played a major role in influencing his decision to study law and religion in academia.
Just as his grandfather closely interacted with a major political and religious leader, Soni has also kindled a personal relationship with a renowned spiritual figure: the Dalai Lama.
“I lived in a Buddhist monastery, and just as [my grandfather] spent a lot of time with Gandhi, I spent a lot of time with the Dalai Lama,” Soni said. “So I’ve had my experience with a transformative religious leader, as he did.”
Soni first met the Dalai Lama in college, when he was living in a Buddhist monastery.
“It was a very fortuitious meeting,” Soni said. “I was sitting under the tree where the Buddha was enlightened, at the very place he was enlightened, the sun was rising, it was Gandhi’s birthday, I was meditating. I opened my eyes, there was laughter, and the Dalai Lama was walking toward me.”
This proved to be the start of an enduring relationship. Several years ago, Soni hosted the Dalai Lama on campus and introduced him to his own students, reminding him of his first meeting with the leader during his college years and bringing the experience full circle. He now considers the Dalai Lama to be one of his gurus, seeking to internalize what he’s learned from him over the years.
“I saw in the Dalai Lama a type of wisdom and joy in his being, and I wanted to emulate that in my life,” Soni said.
Though Soni remains the only Hindu to hold the title of dean of religious life anywhere in the country, he feels that the faith’s teachings provide a unique perspective on truth that he has found essential as dean.
“As a Hindu, I was raised with the idea that … there is no exclusive “truth,” that we’re all on our own truth journeys, but that we’re all moving in the same direction and ultimately trying to achieve the same thing,” Soni said. “That idea has been really important to me as dean of religious life, where my job is not to support or endorse one tradition over another, but to support all traditions equally.”
One piece of advice Soni has to students is to not limit themselves. Though it is often easy to think of a career path as one-dimensional, he said students should strive to pursue their passions, however diverse or unrelated.
“What has served me well is not thinking about what I want to be, but what I want to do,” Soni said. “I think we do a disservice to our children when we ask them, ‘What do you want to be when you grow up?’ I think the question should be ‘What do you want to do when you grow up?’ It’s cool to be the dean of religious life — it’s a great title, but the title isn’t enough to get me in the office every day. It’s the work I get excited about. The title is cool, but the work is inspiring.”
Soni’s path to the position was unconventional, to say the least. But now that he is able to utilize the skills he’s learned throughout his life and fulfill his academic and religious aspirations as USC’s spiritual leader, he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“This isn’t a job I ever thought I could get, because I’m a non-ordained Hindu attorney,” Soni said. “But when I got this job, I realized it’s the job that I always wanted. I just didn’t know it.”
The only way is Jesus. Only Jesus saves.

Photo courtesy of USC Department of Public SafetyTrojan family · Sonya Lee had deep-rooted connections to USC — her daugher is an alumna and her brother works in USC Transportation.
Sonya Lee, a community service officer at the USC Department of Public Safety for 13 years, died Friday as the result of a traffic collision. She was 49.
During her career, Lee worked at the Health Sciences Campus, the bookstore, Adopt-a-Hall, the USC Village, Camera Surveillance, and most recently at 3434 Grand Avenue.
DPS Chief John Thomas said that Lee was an exemplary officer whose devotion and commitment to USC shone through in the quality of her work. 
“She cared deeply about USC,” Thomas said. “She really cared about providing quality service. She was exactly the kind of officer that we want at our department — really at your service, but also caring about people.” 
Thomas said Lee was also a kind, genuine person who always had a smile on her face and brightened up the days of everyone around her. 
“Sonya was by far one of the nicest people you’d ever want to meet,” Thomas said. “She cared about the students. She was very compassionate, a person who loved people. She was always smiling, always positive and really enjoyed working here at USC.” 
Thomas said that Lee would be remembered for her selfless spirit and positive energy. 
“Anyone who has been at DPS for a length of time would say the same thing,” Thomas said. “She was always helping people. She’s one of those people that no one would have a negative thing to say about her.” 
Lee’s family is heavily connected to the USC community. Her daughter Destinee received her master’s degree from USC. Her brother Billy also works at the USC in the transportation department. Lee is survived by her daughter, her two brothers, Billy and Bernard, and her mother and father.
In Lee’s memory, Thomas authorized all uniformed personnel to wear a mourning band.
I knew miss Lee she was a sweetheart I’m so glad to have known her my deepest sympathy to her family Sonja Lee rest in heaven dear angel

In an epic display of passion and competitive fire, the top-ranked USC beach volleyball team put an exclamation point on their regular season with a huge 4-1 victory over crosstown rival No. 2 UCLA over the weekend at Merle Norman Stadium. The matchup between the nation’s best was one to remember, as the Trojans completed their dual slate undefeated at 30-0 and improved their incredible school-record winning streak to 60 consecutive matches dating back to last season. Furthermore, USC snapped the Bruins’ (26-3) own school-record 24-match win streak in the process and remained perfect in the series history against UCLA at 7-0 all-time.
Saturday was a big day for USC athletics, with multiple crosstown rivalry matches on tap across tennis, beach volleyball and women’s water polo. However, it was perhaps an even bigger day for head coach Anna Collier’s
five-member senior class, who played in their final home matches and were honored in pregame Senior Day ceremonies. The most successful class in USC beach volleyball program history — comprised of seniors Sophie Bukovec, Kelly Claes, Sara Hughes, Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler — have amassed over 400 wins individually in their four years and were the
first-ever true recruiting class for Collier back in 2014. In particular, Hughes, the winningest player in NCAA beach volleyball history, became the first high school player to declare that she would only play sand volleyball in college back in 2013 and has been the staple in USC’s rise to national prominence. Since then, Hughes and her veteran classmates have led USC to
back-to-back national championships in 2015 and 2016 and an unblemished record in 2017. Fittingly enough, it would be those five seniors who came up big in Saturday’s rivalry matchup against UCLA. 
To begin the dual, the Trojans fell behind 0-1 after USC’s youngest pair, sophomore Abril Bustamante and freshman Joy Dennis, took a 13-21, 19-21 loss against UCLA’s Jordan Anderson and Izzy Carey at the four spot. Then, after dropping a close second set, USC’s No. 5 tandem of juniors Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer were forced to a third against the Bruins’ Chanti Holroyd and Lily Justine before pulling out the thrilling 21-16, 19-21, 15-9 victory. That win by Belton and Kremer would knot things up in the dual at 1-1 and ignite the fire underneath the rest of their Trojan teammates in the next wave of play. 
All even heading into the top flight of matches, things would turn into a best-of-three series on courts one, two and three. At the No. 2 spot, Bukovec and Wheeler used mini point spurts in the middle of both sets and solid blocking at the net to run away with an identical 21-13,
21-13 victory over Kamila Tan and Madi Yeomans and give USC its first lead of the day, 2-1. With fans now packed in the stands, along the courts, and even above the adjacent parking structure surrounding Merle Norman Stadium, all eyes turned to the top court to watch senior All-Americans Claes and Hughes take on UCLA’s Megan and Nicole McNamara. After capturing the first set 21-15 over the Bruins, USC’s all-time winningest pair fought back from a 3-point deficit late in the second frame to reach set, match and dual point. To the roar of the crowd, Claes and Hughes fended off the UCLA attack and squashed the Bruins’ hopes for an upset on a huge cross-court smash by Claes, ending the set 22-20 and clinching the dual win for USC, 3-1.
With the outcome already decided, heads then shifted to the far end of Merle Norman Stadium, where junior Terese Cannon and senior Nicolette Martin were engaged in a long battle with UCLA’s Torrey Van Winden and Elize Zappia on court three. After dropping a tight first set, 19-21, Cannon and Martin came back to win the second, 22-20. As spectators gathered around and both teams surrounded the court to finish off the day, consecutive aces by Cannon helped USC pull away and eventually claim the 15-10 victory in the third set to seal the 4-1 win over UCLA. All in all, the Trojans extended their streak to 16 consecutive home victories, while each of the five seniors came away with wins in their final matches on home sand to cap a successful Senior Day.
USC will now take its 60-match winning streak with them to the desert when they head to Tucson, Ariz. for the Pac-12 Championships tournament hosted by the University of Arizona from Thursday to Saturday. The Trojans are the defending Pac-12 champions, having won the conference title last season when they hosted the event at Merle Norman Stadium, while Claes and Hughes are the defending Pac-12 pairs champions.

USC’s long search for a new women’s basketball head coach ended on Friday, as Athletic Director Lynn Swann announced Mark Trakh would return to lead the Trojans after an eight-year absence.
Trakh, 61, previously coached USC for five seasons, from 2005 to 2009, guiding the Trojans to two NCAA Tournament berths and four Pac-12 Tournament semifinals and one
Pac-12 final. The NCAA Tournament appearance in 2005, Trakh’s first season, was the program’s first in seven years, and USC progressed past the first round, losing on a last-second basket against top-seeded Michigan State in the Round of 32.
“I’m excited to once again be a part of the great tradition at USC,” Trakh said. “I feel that there is a ton of potential in this team, and I look forward to start working with them.”
USC finished with a 15-14 record in Trakh’s final season, falling to Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship in the Trojans’ first-ever tournament final.
Trakh’s arrival brings an end to an extended coaching search during which multiple candidates linked to USC took positions at different programs — some at rival Pac-12 schools.
“Mark is a great teacher of the game,” Swann said. “Players enjoy playing for him.  He is a very effective recruiter. And he has a knack for taking teams to the NCAA Tournament, which we look for him to continue doing.”
Always liked Coach Trakh when he coached at USC previously. You could talk to him easily. Got a raw deal from Garrett
at the time. The joke is an extended coaching search with only one outsider from Florida Gulf Coast who turned them down.
Hopefully new coach will get the program back on Trakh to make the ncaa tournament on a yearly basis.
A lazy and uninspired hire.  Expect the team to stay on the wrong Trakh.

After having its NCAA-record winning streak snapped against Stanford earlier this month, the second-ranked women’s water polo team fell for the second time in three games on Saturday, losing to No. 1 UCLA 11-7 in Westwood.
 The top-two clash began in predictably neck-and-neck fashion. The Bruins struck first thanks to Maddie Musselman, but USC struck back within minutes. Set up with a six-on-five advantage, freshman driver Denise Mammolito cannoned a shot off the crossbar before junior utility Hayley McKelvey pounced on the rebound to tie the game.
UCLA pulled ahead once more with 30 seconds left in the first quarter, but the Trojans responded promptly again with a goal from senior driver Stephania Haralabidis.
It appeared the back-and-forth would continue throughout the game, but the Bruins then scored four unanswered goals to put USC in a 6-2 hole at the half. Alexa Tielmann added UCLA’s seventh less than a minute into the third quarter to extend the lead even further before senior 2-meter Brigitta Games ended the Trojan drought with her first goal of the game.
Games’ effort would kick off a streak of three unanswered USC goals. Haralabidis added her second of the game after the Trojans killed a
shorthanded six-on-five, and freshman utility Maud Megens pulled her team within two with three minutes left in the third quarter.
 It was as close as USC would come, however, as UCLA responded with a goal of its own just 20 seconds later. The Bruins then converted a power play to extend their lead back to four scores. The Trojans narrowed the margin to two in the final period thanks to second goals from Megens and Games, but the comeback bid ultimately fell short. USC was unable to cash in on two
six-on-five opportunities in the fourth quarter while the Bruins padded their lead en route to the 11-7 victory.
 USC had won three in a row against the Bruins before the weekend, but the Trojans’ first defeat to their archrivals since 2015 locked UCLA into the top seed and a first-round bye at this week’s MPSF Tournament, which the Bruins will also host at the Spieker Aquatics Center. USC will enter the bracket on Friday as the third seed, taking on
sixth-seeded San Jose State at 12:45 p.m.

Diehard sports fans are irrational. There is some unquantifiable and illogical aspect of sports that makes every passionate fan value sports way more than we probably should. Admittedly, I made my decision to attend USC partially based on the fact that I needed to be at the Coliseum on Saturdays in the fall. While the logical reason for choosing a college is academics, which USC has in spades, I simply couldn’t stomach the idea of putting on any other colors besides the cardinal and gold. 
I’ve been a Trojan fan since I was six years old. While other kids would choose school-recommended books for summer reading, I plowed through Athlon, Phil Steele and Street and Smith’s college football guides, memorizing the USC offensive and defensive lines before I learned my times tables. My introduction to the world of Trojan football came at a good time. Former head football coach Pete Carroll’s first year was not great, but in year two, the first season I truly remember, the Trojans took off.
Most of my favorite memories from elementary school have to do with USC.  I watched Carson Palmer absolutely torch the Fighting Irish and cement his Heisman Trophy candidacy with my dad on a Friday night from the basement of a synagogue because we were out of town for a family friend’s bar mitzvah (this really added meaning to the whole football as a religion concept). 
I vividly remember Mike Williams’ touchdown pass to Matt Leinart in the 2004 Rose Bowl. I remember eating a taquito every time the Trojans scored against Oklahoma in their route to their sole BCS national title. I was for two days after that, and I haven’t eaten a taquito since. I remember Dwayne Jarrett’s blurry-eyed catch on fourth-and-nine and the roller coaster of emotions as time expired and the few precious seconds that were added back to make way for the Bush Push against Notre Dame. I remember the feeling of Trojan superiority when November hit because no one was beating Carroll.
It wasn’t just the championships and the Rose Bowls and the legendary moments. It was coming back against Arizona State from a 21-3 deficit behind Lendale White overpowering an overmatched Sun Devils defense. It was thoroughly dominating Oregon with Dennis Dixon and Jonathan Stewart and forcing Nebraska and Bill Callahan to play keep-away and still lose by a lot. It was always being confident USC would find a way to win, no matter the score or the situation.
I remember thinking that USC was always going to be this good, even after the Texas loss (which still ranks as one of the worst days of my life). Then the dominoes started to fall. It was small things at first: roadblocks that kept the team out of National Title games and instead restricted USC to vying for consolation Rose Bowls. Then came John David Booty’s broken finger and an upset Thursday night loss in Corvallis, when the Rodgers brothers and the Beavers shocked the Trojans.
Then it was bigger things, like Mark Sanchez leaving too early and Jim Harbaugh thinking it was OK to go for two and Carroll jumping ship before the sanctions hit. Even sadder than this slow demise was that it wasn’t just football that fell. The basketball team was probably an even bigger passion for me. I thought when Daniel Hackett shut down Kevin Durant and the Trojans beat the Longhorns in the 2007 NCAA Tournament, USC basketball was going to be a power. Then Taj Gibson picked up his fourth foul while the team was up 12 points against North Carolina in the Sweet 16, and Trojan basketball was never quite the same. 
High school, unfortunately, was a wasteland of sorts when it came to rooting for USC. In football, there was the upset win against a top-ranked Oregon team in Eugene and the 50-0 beat down of UCLA, and in basketball, there was the occasional big win over the Bruins. However, I came to college hoping that USC’s fortunes would turn and somehow there would be a national title in there for football or a Final Four berth for basketball.
While we didn’t quite have that the last four years, I did become an even bigger Trojan fan. Dealing with former head football coaches Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian taught me what it was like to root for an underachieving program. Sitting through a too-close-for-comfort basketball game between USC and Northern Arizona taught patience. 
I was also lucky to be a columnist for the Daily Trojan for four years and sit in the press box for some games. As just a fan with zero professional sports journalism aspirations, it was such a privilege to go down on the field for the final five minutes of games. I’ll never forget when USC played Cal in 2015, and I was right there when Justin Davis bounced it outside to get the game-clinching first down. The speed with which he moved was truly astounding and will stick with me forever.
It wasn’t just that, though. Sitting in class and making friends with members of the teams and working on exceptionally difficult Asian art history projects together gives you a different rooting interest when its people you know on the field. You root a little harder and have a bit more compassion when they get burned on a deep route or drop a catchable pass.
I would argue that there is no better place to go to college than USC even if you aren’t a sports fan, but being a diehard Trojan makes it even better. Sitting through miserable football losses to Washington State and Washington makes redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold’s emergence and USC’s Rose Bowl victory that much sweeter. Watching blowout defeat after blowout defeat for two years at the Galen Center makes a quadruple-overtime conquest against Arizona or a buzzer-beater against SMU in the NCAA Tournament that much better.
Growing up, I had the luck of becoming a Trojan football and basketball fan just as the first became a dynasty and the second gained respectability. It gave me confidence that USC would always win, no matter the score. There was a time in recent years that that unwavering confidence was lost, but thanks to Darnold, Helton and Enfield, it is back. It remains to be seen whether or not this will be the start of another dynasty or a brief resurgence, but either way, I’ll be there, hoping for another 34-game win streak or Sweet 16 berth.
There is nothing quite as satisfying as being a college sports fan, especially when you are rooting for the Trojans.

“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”
The words of my childhood hero, Albus Dumbledore, resonate with me in the 20 days before I walk into a future with the choices I have made as a student these past three years at USC. 
Since last September, I have made the choice to advocate for mental health on campus while seeking and receiving psychological care at the Student Counseling Center at the Engemann Health Center. I have put aside self, peer, family, co-worker and faculty perceptions of my abilities in sharing my struggles with anorexia, depression and anxiety from ages 13 to 20 through music, poetry and talks with RSG and USG leadership. I made the choice to take leadership of USC’s Active Minds chapter, one of the only two student organizations programming for mental health awareness and resources. 
My experiences have informed me that there is not yet sustained mental health education and care to ensure and enhance the well-being of the 44,000 Trojans on the University Park Campus. In light of a discriminatory national climate on immigration and racial and gender discrimination, there must be greater efforts to create inclusivity of access and informed communication regarding mental health within LGBT and multi-ethnic student populations — two communities defining USC’s longstanding national rankings as a top-25 LGBT-inclusive campus and No. 15 in student body diversity. More so, sustained collaboration between Engemann, cultural centers under Student Affairs and the USC administration is essential to ensuring student academic and professional success. 
Sergio Gonzalez, a graduate intern at the LGBT Resource Center, felt that the resources at Engemann didn’t take his identity into account.
“Last spring, I was diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety,” Gonzalez said. “I specifically asked for a queer counselor at the health center, but there was only one who worked full-time who could not help me. It was very heteronormative. They outsourced me to Downtown for hours of testing. There was a backup of months on waitlists near campus until I finally got care near West Hollywood.” 
Established in 2005 as a division of Student Affairs, the LGBT Resource Center promotes mental health education and resources for staff and faculty through ally trainings under the Safe Zone Program.
While the advocacy of seven undergraduate and four graduate student organizations and the doubling of the Resource Center’s physical space at the Student Union have contributed to the community’s visibility, Matthew Carrera, a first year master’s student at the USC Rossier school of Education, said that the general decentralization of the USC administration’s initiatives for student wellbeing and the lack of ongoing and mandatory ally training for University officials impedes sustainable access to care within the community. 
“It’s challenging to be able to partner with faculty in the various departments from which our students come from,” said Rosalind Conerly, director of the Center for black Cultural and Student Affairs.  “It’s hard to track specific student mental health needs since many come to our space for many different reasons.” 
This February, Conerly organized one of CBCSA’s first mental health-related event featuring the documentary “Outside of the House” and a Q&A with the director and Engemann pyschotherapist Bruce Wallis. At USC, the experiences and stigma of mental illness and related issues in the black community and other multicultural communities expand across a large range of ethnicities and nationalities. 
Matt Weisbly is a sophomore and an information specialist at Asian Pacific American Student Services, which provides confidential, 15-20 minute consultations with counseling staff in its office every Monday from 1-3 p.m. He said that the Asian Pacific American experience stifles help-seeking.
“There was limited emotional expression growing up as half-Asian,” Weisbly said.
“I feel more prepared to help with experiences of helping friends here. I’m glad that USC is making helping less of a burden and life experience.” 
During the summer of his freshman year, Weisbly participated in training programs facilitated by the Student Counseling Services to become an APASS mentor for freshman and transfer students. He learned specifically about resources for victims of sexual assault and points of contact for help-seeking within the APA community at USC. 
The lack of inclusive and 24/7 emergency services and difficult student transitions to off-campus care is indicative of mental health crises across campuses nationwide. USC must first support student initiatives to seek and sustain care through administrative measures to require staff and faculty trainings on mental health and protect student health information. Second, USC must promote student mental health in gender and multiethnic diversity by tailoring existing counseling services and programming through student surveys through cultural centers. 
Prioritizing our mental health is a choice we make for developing and strengthening our academic and professional capabilities and the overall safety and success of the Trojan Family.

Letter to the editor:
Student Counseling Services (SCS) is very concerned when any student does not feel understood.  SCS has a diverse staff, including several LGBT-identified staff, that receives ongoing multicultural competency, ally, and transgender training. It is disconcerting that students needing help may read this opinion piece and be deterred from using our service based on one person’s experience. 
-The SCS client satisfaction survey from the past two semesters rated their counselor as “very good” or “excellent” with regard to sensitivity to diversity and cultural issues.
-97% of these 400 respondents say that they would use the center again and refer their friends.
-45% of SCS clients in Fall 2016 self-identified as students of color.
-SCS together with the cultural centers provide the “Cultural Center Drop-in” program which is open to all students for a solution-focused, 20 minute consultation. Drop-in hours are Mondays from 12-2 pm, hosted in the APASS office in the Student Union.  
It is necessary for some students to be referred out for specific concerns like ADHD testing and specialized or intensive psychotherapy and treatment. We do want to hear students’ concerns, and I encourage them to contact their counselor or myself at SCS. If they are not satisfied with the response, they may also email Engemann Student Health Center . Student care is our priority and we want to ensure that they are connected with the resources they need. 
Sincerely,

Another damn snowflake that needs a safe zone. Once you graduate and get into the real world you will find there are no safe zones. I was a 7th. grader in 1962 during the Cuban Missle Crisis. We were on the verge of nuclear war that could have ended all human life on Earth. We lived through it without safe zones, puppies being given us, and none of this horse manure you little pussies are demanding. Grow up and get a life. You cry babies can’t even survive an election. We also had to take our classroom tests, quizzes and get our homework done every evening. Grow some balls.

There is less than a month until graduation, and I feel suspended between excited anticipation and inevitable hesitance. Articulating what these past three years have meant for me personally is a task surely encumbered by trite expressions and saccharine sentiment. However, I hope to reflect on the good, focusing on the gratitude that has sustained me in these final weeks and quiets any anxiety about the future.
Processing the countless hours spent preparing for graduation day, I return to the day I received my acceptance letter. At the beginning of my senior year of high school, the thought of applying to USC was inconceivable. Growing up in Southern California, I knew USC as the school you attended if you played football, or if you were a legacy who grew up chanting, “Fight on!”
Despite my Bruin upbringing, something compelled me to apply in early January at the 11th hour. I did not know then that I would be overcome with excitement when I received my acceptance letter in the mail. After visiting campus and meeting professors and students, I realized that my prejudices against the Trojans were unfounded.
Today, I am as grateful as ever that I said “yes” to this school. I think about the small lessons I have learned about my own pride and idealism. When I started my freshman year, people warned me about all the pages of reading and that, in college, you have to learn to “skim.” Despite my efforts to prove I could read every page, I quickly learned the art of skimming. I remember taking 20 units in my first spring semester, eager to show that I could take on a heavier course load, balance extracurriculars and get all As. Sure I got the grades, but I realized unnecessarily pushing myself for no defined reason was not worth my health and sanity.
I think about all the opportunities this school has afforded me. I have traveled from Washington, D.C. to Oxford, England for research, meeting lifelong friends and mentors along the way. I have had the chance to sit in classrooms with professors and peers who have challenged my assumptions and exposed me to perspectives of which I was previously ignorant. I have received criticism and praise that were equally invaluable.
I would be remiss, most of all, to fail to mention what the Daily Trojan has meant to me. The Daily Trojan reignited the passion for journalism I thought I abandoned after high school. Here, I have found my voice not only as a writer but also an advocate. The opinion pages have given me a platform to both understand myself, especially as a woman who cares deeply about social and political issues, and enter into a conversation with the community around me.
To every person who inspired one of my columns, thank you. To anyone who has ever read one of my columns, and sent an affirming text message or left an encouraging comment on Facebook, thank you. To the members of the Daily Trojan staff who work tirelessly and genuinely love this paper, thank you. To my friends and family who listen to me when I’m not getting my thoughts out on the page, thank you.
Despite my love of words, there are times when they do not suffice. Parting with the column that has given shape to the person I am and the school that has provided me with every opportunity is one of those times. Although I know I will continue to write, this last column indeed marks an end and a very special goodbye.

On Friday, the Musical Theatre Repertory at USC presented Edges, a song-cycle musical comprised of individual songs performed in a sequence and written by songwriting duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. The musical is made up of 15 songs: Each song contains unrelated stories and characters, but still possesses similar coming-of-age themes that are indelibly intertwined. Each vignette illuminates characters that are on the edge of their young lives, struggling to grapple with the daunting issues of adulthood.
MTR is a student theater company at USC that produces an array of musicals spanning multiple genres. This past year, they presented several notable works, including Company, Stephen Sondheim’s famous musical, and Heathers, a rock musical written by Laurence O’Keefe and Kevin Murphy that was adapted into the 1989 feature film.
Edges is the most contemporary musical MTR has presented this semester. Pasek and Paul were undergraduates at the University of Michigan when they composed the piece in 2005. Beyond Edges, Pasek and Paul went on to have wildly successful careers as a creative team, writing the acclaimed Broadway musical Dear Evan Hansen, as well as the lyrics in La La Land. 
Ultimately, MTR’s production of Edges was not only highly entertaining, but also extremely relevant to students at USC. The songs address some of the most challenging aspects of adulthood, including relationships, career prospects, commitment, heartbreak, rejection and failure. MTR impressively managed to assemble a simple, yet highly nuanced portrayal of these multifaceted themes.
Edges involved a small cast of eight, starring Liz Buzbee, Chas Conacher, Marissa DuBowy, Tyler Ellis, Taylor Kass, Carson Klasner, Maxine Phoenix and Patrick Wallace. The show was directed by Taubert Nadalini, a senior majoring in theatre, and Annika Ellwanger-Chavez, a junior majoring in theatre with an emphasis in acting.
“Because there are so many different songs that target different aspects of youth, optimism and goal-setting, people of all walks of life can relate to the show,” Nadalini said. “[Edges] champions hope and showcases how people pursue relationships, careers, new horizons — what the obstacles are that get in their way and how they overcome them.”
The overall production compellingly examined the transition from adolescence into adulthood. It was put together in a little over three weeks, which is a short time for an MTR production.
Despite this short preparation period, Taubert and Ellwanger-Chavez succeeded in putting together a piece rife with inventive choreography, set design and formation changes. The only subtle trace of the crew’s brief rehearsal period was through a few unpolished transitions near the beginning of the show. 
In all, Edges as a whole effectively investigated the struggle of a young person in the modern era through memorable lyrics and powerful performances. MTR produced a highly engaging, moving and dynamic production that underscores a deeply universal message.

When I decided to write a column at the beginning of the semester, I had difficulty selecting the topic I’d write about. Despite being an editor of a section focused on arts, entertainment and culture, I felt that my interest in these areas weren’t strong enough to warrant writing a column every other week. But just as I was about to give up on the whole idea of being a columnist, I realized there was one story left that was worth telling: my own.
As I left behind my teenage years to enter adulthood, life still felt so uncertain. It was partially because my career goals were starting to shift, but I was also still trying to find myself in the midst of everything happening around me. It felt as if I had all the puzzle pieces, but needed to put them all together to fully understand who I am.
Writing this column gave me that outlet. I was able to fully express the sentiments that I withheld for so many years about my gender identity, my Vietnamese-American background, my cultural heritage, my religious beliefs and my sexuality. In essence, I had opened up my thoughts and feelings to the rest of the world without fear of consequences — something I never thought I was brave enough to do. But I’m happy I did, and I know that I’m stronger because of it.
Sharing my thoughts in this column did have its consequences. My parents found out about my sexuality, though I meant to keep it hidden from them. Despite this leading to a strained relationship with my family, I was finally able to find myself amid all the messy pieces of my life.
In retrospect, a lot has already happened in 2017. I turned 20. I got my first internship and started listening to EDM. I witnessed the death of a friend. I became truly open about my sexuality, but I jeopardized my relationship with my parents. During spring break, I went on a solo trip to Chicago. And when I came back, I withdrew from a class. But at last, I finally found myself.
There were moments when I wanted to quit writing. When my parents found out about what I had published about my sexuality, I felt like I had disappointed them beyond measure and that there was no way that they would ever forgive me for bringing our family to shame. I spent several weeks questioning my own existence. And it took many teardrops to realize my worth as a person in this world. During my solo trip to Chicago, it even took a Wednesday evening in the snow to realize that I needed to live according to my own terms, and to not let anyone or anything obstruct my view of the future. The Chicago trip helped me reflect on my progression thus far in life, and how much more I have yet to accomplish, despite the academic, professional and personal setbacks I’ve faced.
All of that contributed to the change that occurred throughout the course of the semester. Though there were parts of me that remained the same, I learned that it was OK to evolve, and that I needed to embrace the change that was occurring in my life. Of the more minor changes, I began to develop a liking for electronic music. And of the more major changes, I learned that it was important to take a gamble and be vulnerable because that was easiest way to finally accept and understand every part of my identity.
Before this semester, I was under the impression that I would always remain the same, no matter what. However, I now know that change is instrumental to growing up — and that it will allow me to become the best version of myself as I mature. When I left for Chicago, I spent much of the time I had considering what direction I wanted to take in my life. Would I continue to chastise myself for not going to church or not being the person my parents expected me to be? Or would I learn to let go of the past, let life run its course and just be spontaneous?
In the end, I’m confident I chose the right path for myself. I no longer fear change. I no longer fear being judged for expressing myself. I no longer fear disappointing other people. And now, I know that I’m capable of happiness if I just remain true to myself and be open to exploring different possibilities. In the end, life has a way of surprising us no matter how much we try to prevent it. Our identities are constantly shifting and molding according to our present experiences and relationships with others. And despite these changes, I’ll always be content with myself for all my flaws. That’s what matters the most.
