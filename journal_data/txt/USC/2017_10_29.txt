The men’s water polo team showed off its depth against San Jose State on Saturday as 16 members of the roster scored at least one goal in the Trojans’ 24-8 victory at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. Since it was Senior Day, it couldn’t be more fitting that out of those 16, every player in USC’s 13-man senior class got on the scoresheet. The Trojans were sharp on both offense and defense, giving the team confidence heading into its final three matches of the regular season — and then onto the MPSF Tournament and NCAA Championships.
“I think we are the most well-balanced team in the competition for sure,” senior driver Blake Edwards said. “Our list goes very deep, and that’s just from the last three years and how the program has rebuilt us. It’s definitely a strength that we have because, for other teams’ defenses, it’s going to be really hard to stop us because anyone can step up on any day and any occasion.”
Four players — senior utility James Walters, senior driver Grant Stein, freshman driver Marko Vavic and sophomore driver Marin Dasic — all scored hat tricks before the final whistle. Stein, Vavic and Dasic put up 2 goals each to start the Trojans off strong in the first period before Walters added a goal to stake them an early 7-0 lead. By the second period, Dasic had already completed his hat trick. In the third period of play, every goal was scored by a senior as the USC defense shut the Spartans out in the period. The list of scorers continued to grow, and San Jose State never had a chance to make a comeback. 
“Offensively, we looked quite good today,” Edwards said. “We made some really good passes and finished the high-percentage opportunities.”
On the defensive end, the Trojans held San Jose State to 8 goals. Four of those goals came from Jacob Mercep, who continued to pester USC even in the face of an impossible deficit. Senior goalie McQuin Baron saved seven shots in three periods before redshirt sophomore Simon Wu entered the cage in the fourth quarter and claimed a save of his own. 
However, as always, the Trojans are looking ahead at what they need to improve for the next game.
“I think tightening up our defense a little bit,” Edwards said. “[Cal has] some real weapons that we need to stop down and shut out.”
Looking forward to facing the Bears next Saturday, the Trojans used this game as preparation and practice for what is to come. Naturally, USC has been itching for a rematch, as Cal defeated the Trojans in the NCAA title match last season.
“We had a couple of things we wanted to work on for Cal next weekend, which is our main focus and has been our main focus for the last couple of weeks,” Edwards said. 
That focus translated to the game against San Jose State and its overall score, but the team is still looking to keep improving its defense, which has been one of the Trojans’ main goals for the season. They know that defense wins games and that their offense is not their struggle, as they exhibited this weekend.
“[Cal] has a few guys who are real scorers, and we’re going to have to play really tight defense on those guys and their impact on the game,” Edwards said. “But ultimately, we just have to come fired up and ready for a showdown.”
As they have been doing all season, the Trojans are already looking ahead to the next game before their victory celebration was finished — but that just goes to show how focused the team is on its end goal. The next step is taking on the team that stole USC’s prize last year, and the Trojans certainly are not planning to let that happen again.
“We’re looking good, we’re hungry, we’re fired up and we’re ready to go and play them next weekend,” Edwards said.

Eric He | Daily Trojan
Two years ago, USC marched — or rather, sulked — into Arizona State following a disappointing upset to an unranked Stanford team at home, a loss that slowed its hype train considerably after the Trojans had blown out their first two opponents and climbed to No. 6 in the rankings.
They came away with a 42-14 rout of the Sun Devils in what was Steve Sarkisian’s shining moment at USC (ironically, this was the game where Sarkisian, according to reports, coached while not sober). That game gave the 2015 Trojans some relief, a sense that the season wasn’t yet lost.
Saturday night seemed like a repeat of that game — minus the Sark, of course. Something about Tempe just seems to rejuvenate the Trojans, give them life and look like the team everyone thought they would be preseason.
And for this year’s USC squad, after a 49-14 humiliation at the hands of Notre Dame last week, playing ASU on the road was, once again, the exact recipe it needed. 
The Trojans pummeled the Sun Devils yet again, and this one had to feel good. The final score was 48-17, and it was every bit the blowout that the scoreboard indicated. For a team that has lacked any sort of punch, any sort of identity, any sort of juice all season, USC found all three on Saturday night. 
The offense, which looked lost against Notre Dame — and has been mediocre at best up to this point — came to life. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold did the things we thought he would do since Week 1, putting together a solid, turnover-free game — save for a meaningless fumble on fourth down — for the first time this season. 
“These are very prideful individuals in that locker room,” head coach Clay Helton said. “Both as players and coaches. I praise this team because they never stop fighting. Obviously, it’s a confidence builder. As a head coach, you never want that lingering mentality coming off a loss. Usually, the better teams clear it out. That’s what these kids did tonight. They had their jaws set and played some of their best football of the season.”
A lot of players had their best games of the season, and it started with the quarterback. From the opening drive and onward, Darnold was the Darnold we know and love. 
He floated a ball perfectly to junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett for the first touchdown of the night. But it was a 19-yard touchdown pass to redshirt freshman wide receiver Tyler Vaughns in the second quarter that was Darnold’s best pass of the night, fitting it in a tight window over the middle, right over the outstretched hands of Sun Devils cornerback Chad Adams. It was reminiscent of Darnold’s game-tying touchdown pass in the Rose Bowl to Burnett, the version of Darnold that has disappeared this season, save for a few fleeting moments such as that one.
Like Darnold, junior running back Ronald Jones II also needed to rebound after logging just 32 yards against Notre Dame. And Jones delivered, not only carrying the load with freshman running back Stephen Carr still hurt, but also looking superhuman with two long touchdown runs, exploding through tackles and gaps for scores that kept USC’s big lead afloat.
And there shouldn’t be any doubt who Darnold’s top target should be for the remainder of the season. Vaughns had a career night, recording over 100 yards in catches for the first time. He had two touchdown grabs and averaged 21 yards on his six catches — a sign that he can be the explosive, big-play receiver that USC has been searching for all season to replace JuJu Smith-Schuster. Vaughns’ first score featured a nicely timed pivot after the catch that opened up room, and he worked for his second touchdown, hanging onto the ball despite taking a big hit in the end zone after the catch. Vaughns’ emergence is pivotal for Darnold, who needs more consistent weapons to turn to at wide receiver.
“Tyler has been a big part to the passing game for a while now,” Darnold said. “I think the way he works and the fact that every single play the ball is coming to him is huge. That’s a really great mentality to have as a receiver.”
On the other side of the ball, the defense was sensational, limiting an above-average Arizona State offense to 17 points. In one stretch in the first half, the Sun Devils were held to just one first down in a span of five possessions, with the Trojans forcing three-and-out after three-and-out. It had to be a welcome sight for a USC defense that barely had a pulse against Notre Dame, a confidence-booster heading into the final stretch of the season.
So that’s where we turn next: the home stretch. Remember, after USC demolished Arizona State in 2015, the Trojans were upset the following week by the Huskies at home. Then, following Sarkisian’s infamous firing, USC dropped another game at Notre Dame in Helton’s second debut as an interim coach.
This time around, the Trojans will need to build off the momentum. While it can sigh with relief in beating Arizona State, USC cannot afford to let its foot off the gas pedal. Not against Arizona and Khalil Tate — the Sam Darnold of 2017 — next week. Not against Colorado the following week, especially on the road in the thin air. And definitely not against UCLA, which, for all its struggles this season, would surely love to ruin USC’s Pac-12 title hopes in the final week.
The Trojans may have passed the test in Tempe with flying colors. But there is much more to come, if they hope to salvage what is left of their season.

During her first week at USC, Ana Lucia Rivera would introduce herself to people as just “Ana.” As a freshman international student from Honduras, she didn’t want people to deal with two names.
But Rivera, an international relations major, came to realize that her name wasn’t just “Ana,” and she didn’t need to sacrifice her identity just because she was in America.
“Every time I meet someone [now], I’m like, ‘My name is Ana Lucia,’” Rivera said.
In many ways, Rivera’s anecdote epitomizes the experience of an international student at any university in the country. It is the struggle to adapt to a new country, a new culture. It is the dilemma of whether to change your identity. It is the challenge to fit in while speaking a second language and moving away from home for the first time.
But it is especially true at USC, which enrolls among the most international students of any university in the country. This academic year, the University brought in its most diverse freshman class in history, with international students now comprising nearly a quarter of the student body. Sixteen percent of the incoming freshman class came from 50 different countries, a figure that rose 2 percent from the 2016 freshman unit. Prior to 2014, USC had been the most popular option for international students for 13 consecutive years, according to the Los Angeles Times.
At a school of 44,000, it’s easy for international students to get lost in the shuffle. And oftentimes, they are. USC has championed a culture of diversity, the various international flags hanging at the Von KleinSmid Center serving as a symbol of welcome. But at the personal level, it’s difficult to grasp how each international student will adapt to a campus,  country and  culture they may not have experienced before.
A different world
There is one similarity every international student shares upon entering the United States: culture shock.
A common trigger is the food. Rivera, who grew up in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, was accustomed to eating a heavy diet of beans, especially baleada, a classic Honduran dish. 
“I’m a freshman so I have to eat from the dining hall,” Rivera said. “It’s just eggs, bacon — the same thing.”
Another is football knowledge, or lack thereof. At a school where every Saturday of fall semester is centered around football games, many international students enter USC not knowing that football isn’t “soccer.” Xiaoyue Zhang, a senior from Shanghai double majoring in business administration and accounting, was one of them.
“At USC, people are really eager to talk about sports or football and stuff, and I had no clue what they were talking about the first few years,” Zhang said. “I think that’s common.”
Felix Tam, a junior majoring in  international relations and the global economy who grew up in Hong Kong, said he has a professor in his business law class who frequently brings up football during class, and it makes him feel out of place.
“He’s gone to every football game since he was a freshman,” Tam said. “Every time he talks about football so enthusiastically and the class echoes with him, I don’t feel like I’m a part of it.”
There are minor things, too, like greetings. In Honduras, Rivera was accustomed to saying “Good morning,” or “How are you doing?” to people all the time, whether she knew them or not.
“Here, people don’t really do that,” Rivera said. “When I go into any place, I’ve been inclined to do it, and some people won’t answer back. Some people will look at me like I’m weird.”
But ultimately, Tam has come to accept the cultural discrepancies, comparing it to a semester-long study abroad program, except for four years.
“I just kind of embraced the cultural shock,” Tam said. “It’s just something that every international student is going to experience. It’s tough for international students to integrate into the culture, but that’s one part that is inevitable. It’s also the reason why we came here.”
Language barrier
Rivera went to an American school in Honduras, one that taught classes in English. Having spoken the language her entire life, she felt confident with it coming into USC. But she only used English in academic settings, switching to Spanish whenever she talked to friends.
“I know what I want to say, but I know I can say it a lot better or faster in Spanish,” Rivera said. “So that’s been a huge difference, learning to just think in English and how to say things in English. I was very confident in my English skills before coming here, but I’ve become more self-conscious about what I’m saying and how I’m saying it.”

Conversational English takes some getting used to for international students. Tam, for instance, didn’t know what the phrase “I’m good” meant when he first arrived in the country. His resident assistant, sensing more questions, referred him to Urban Dictionary.
For others, the language barrier comes at an academic cost. Serphina Wang, a junior from Taiwan majoring in global business, said she sees fellow international students struggle in business classes.
“[Business classes are] very project-based,” Wang said. “I know a lot of Asians who aren’t familiar with it or struggle really hard to come up with something creative. It’s not really their fault; it’s just the way the education system is.”
This can result in international students not being able to showcase their talents to their professors. Zhang said that though her English is strong enough to get through academic work, she has friends who struggle to speak in class.
“They’re capable of doing stuff, but their speaking ability prevents them from looking smart when they are actually smart,” Zhang said.
Fitting in    
When Zhang received her roommate assignment for her freshman year, she could tell from the names that her suitemates were all Chinese. Immediately, she requested a reassignment, and wound up with a roommate from the United States.
“My parents paid so much money for me to experience a Western education,” Zhang said of her logic at the time. “I didn’t want to just go back to the circle I had in high school. I didn’t want to just hang with Chinese people without knowing, ‘What’s the life of Americans, or other international groups?’”
Tam had a similar viewpoint during his freshman year, when he lived in Fluor Tower and frequented Café 84, the former dining hall next to his building.
“There was always this group of mainland Chinese students, just occupying tables, speaking loudly in Mandarin every day, in the same spot,” Tam said. “I was always wondering why they came to the States for college, if they’re just hanging out with their friends from mainland [China].”
However, in reality, many international students are reticent to fully assimilate into American culture, to stray from their pack.
For freshmen like Rivera, surrounding themselves with people who speak the same language can serve as a comforting reminder of home. All her suitemates are from either Colombia or Mexico and speak Spanish, and she’s been able to connect with them from a cultural perspective.
“I can speak Spanish and express myself as I would and they’ll understand me perfectly,” Rivera said.
In retrospect, both Zhang and Tam don’t think that running from their cultures initially did much good.
“I realize now that your cultural identity isn’t something you can change,” Zhang said. “I wouldn’t say hanging with Chinese friends is a bad thing. Even now, after three-and-a-half years, most of my friends are still Chinese or ABCs [American-born Chinese]. I don’t feel easily connected to people who are not Asian.”
Tam, who is now part of the Hong Kong Student Association at USC, regrets not joining the organization earlier.
“My first year, I tried to really separate myself from the Hong Kong community,” he said. “I didn’t really reach out to them. I tried to put myself here and make friends with people from the States. That’s not really good because a balance is more important.”
“That first friend”
The first resident who approached Thomas Finn, a junior majoring in computer engineering and computer science and a resident assistant at Parkside International Residential College, was an international student from Beijing.
“She didn’t know the norms of carrying money around,” Finn said. “None of the dining halls were open, so I took her out to eat. She only had a bunch of $100 bills. I said, ‘OK, in an area like this, you shouldn’t be carrying this much money.’”
It’s advice like this from resident assistants that can serve as valuable lessons for international students, who may not be aware of certain societal customs.
“My job is being that first friend that they have, being someone they can talk to if they get worried or afraid,” Finn said.

But Wang said her resident assistant freshman year did not seem to grasp what she was going through.
“Most RAs are Americans,” Wang said. “A lot of times, they’re not necessarily aware of what other cultures are. My freshman year RA … didn’t really understand the struggles of international students.”
However, this experience  varies by building, and by person. At Parkside, a majority of Finn’s residents are international students. He makes a concerted effort to get to know them, learning their names in their native language, picking up a bit of their language in the process.
One of his suites is split half-and-half between international and non-international students. So Finn played icebreakers with them and helped them talk to each other, eventually getting them to bond through a common interest: K-Pop.
Finn admitted it’s difficult to convince international students to come to residential education events. But his main goal remains making sure they are comfortable and happy.
“I want them to have that college experience regardless of where they’re from,” Finn said. “I don’t want them to feel alone. Every freshman will feel that, but being an international student ups that factor.”
What can USC do?
The Office of International Services, which declined to be interviewed, serves as the official on-campus organization for international students. It helps students with logistics such as obtaining visas and checking their work statuses.
There is also the International Student Assembly, which provides funding for the 20 member organizations, such as the Hong Kong Student Association, under its umbrella. As ISA’s assistant director, Zhang is working with OIS to be more proactive with assisting international students.
“OIS is predominantly right now just providing visa consultation to students,” Zhang said. “We want to make it more resourceful and have more outreach, even provide it more space for international students to chill and rest.”
The ISA itself is also attempting to connect the international student assembly. It has a mentorship program where freshmen or transfer students are paired with more experienced students, who act as a cultural guide of sorts. There are also various workshops that include “Football 101,” where students can familiarize themselves with the game, as well as a “Driving 101” workshop.
“We are a bridge between the school administration and staff and the student body,” Zhang said. “We do both event and advocacy work for international students.”
Still, no matter how fluent their English is or how many local friends they have, they are still international students, with a label attached to them, and a prevailing sense of uncertainty over their identity.
For Wang, her situation is hard to grasp. She was born in California and has a USC alumnus as a father, but moved to Taiwan as a toddler and grew up overseas. Yet, she exemplifies what it means to be an international student.
“I’m in two worlds, and I’m trying to get the best out of it,” Wang said. “I can’t answer what it’s like.”
Wonderful insight about why being an international student away from home is difficult, compounded by our complex culture and language problems. Welcoming and assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   Something that might help anyone coming to the US is the award-winning worldwide book/ebook “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” Used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors, it identifies how “foreigners” have become successful in the US, including students.
   A chapter on education explains how to cope with a confusing new culture and friendship process, and daunting classroom differences. It explains how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas.
   It also identifies the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here.
   Good luck to all at USC or wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who shout the loudest!

When renowned food critic Jonathan Gold announced in his Los Angeles Times column that he visited Sari Sari Store, the newest Filipino food stall in the bustling Grand Central Market, a whopping three times in one week; it was as if almost instantly, the eatery became more jam-packed than ever.
Located near G&B Coffee, Sari Sari took over the former space of Bar Moruno, another formerly popular destination at the market. The simple food stall is best known for its quick traditional Filipino dishes such as adobo fried rice and lechon manok, or rotisserie chicken on garlic rice. Sari Sari’s rice bowls, each served with a toasty egg, are heaven at first bite. The time it took to set the food on an average weekend afternoon was just under an hour, but it was well worth the wait.
Opened by the power couple of the culinary industry, Sari Sari is not the first of Walter and Margarita Manzke’s restaurants, but is another gem to add to the pair’s collection of successful and popular restaurants. Some of the other restaurants in the Manzke empire include Petty Cash and Wildflour Café and Bakery in Manila. Before opening République, a French restaurant in Hancock Park, the Manzkes were just a couple living in the Philippines dreaming of moving to Los Angeles to pursue their culinary dreams.

Margarita Manzke’s love for food and the culinary arts started at a young age — from helping her family in a kitchen at White Rock Resort to studying pastry at Le Cordon Bleu. She then received a culinary degree at The Culinary Institute of America in New York.
Those who don’t have enough time or money to spend at the beloved République restaurant will be delighted to visit Sari Sari, which provides an equally pleasant dining experience by the same chef and owners without breaking the bank. While the wait is a bit longer than most due to its increasing popularity, the hospitality makes up for it completely. Almost every menu item — whether it’s a dessert, sandwich or bowl — is under $13.
In addition to its wide variety of savory rice bowls, Sari Sari also serves halo halo, which means “mixed together” in Tagalog, and buko pie (coconut pie) — two iconic Filipino desserts. Halo halo contains coconut tapioca pudding, leche flan and chunks of fresh fruit. Those who have never tried the combination of jelly and ice cream will find it unusually refreshing and tasty. 
Other favorites include the Filipino breakfast sandwich, arroz caldo (rice porridge) and tortang talong (charred eggplant) for the vegetarians.

Until recently, I had considered myself a musical purist. I used to create separate Spotify playlists for different genres I wanted to listen to, depending on my mood. One for pop: Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa, Ed Sheeran, Niall Horan, Ariana Grande. One for electronic music: Porter Robinson, Gryffin, Snails, Zomboy, Jai Wolf (granted, there’s a wide range here).
The point is, I had always viewed music as being parsed and segmented by genres, each with its own unique, distinctive sound. But as I scrolled through my “dreams” Spotify playlist for inspiration to write this week’s column, I realized that this preconceived notion was no longer the case.
The music industry has evolved over the past couple of years, not only in consumer patterns, but also in the content itself. Streaming is now the backbone of the music industry, with Spotify monopolizing the entire market. Music events like the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which began as a fringe gathering for rock and alternative fans, have become cultural hallmarks, bringing artists across the spectrum and attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.
In the same vein, electronic dance music has permeated through the sphere of pop music, gradually propelling itself into the mainstream and redefining its own cultural boundaries through the commercialization of two particular subgenres: tropical house and future bass. EDM-influenced sounds are omnipresent — and whether people like it or not, it’s a visible indicator of pop music’s evolution, as well as EDM’s emergence from the subcultural realm.
Tropical house — a brighter, smoother offshoot of deep house — has taken pop by storm in the past two to three years, thanks to producers and DJs like Kygo and Robin Schultz. On one end, Kygo, hailed as tropical house’s ultimate pioneer, pushed the subgenre into pop music through collaborations with artists such as Ellie Goulding (“First Time”) and Marvin Gaye (“Sexual Healing” remix). Conversely, pop artists also played a major role in its rise, specifically Justin Bieber, who formally introduced it to Top 40 listeners with “Sorry” and “What Do You Mean?” in his 2015 album Purpose.
The past three years have been big for tropical house. Charlie Puth and Selena Gomez’s chart-topping single “We Don’t Talk Anymore,” Disclosure and Lorde’s “Magnets” and Zedd and Liam Payne’s “Get Low” are all just a few examples of how tropical house has thrust itself into pop radio and blurred the lines of musical categorization.

Similarly, future bass has risen as one of the most prominent examples of EDM fusing into other main genres. Unlike tropical house, however, future bass is much broader sonically, featuring a wide range of sounds woven together by a strong bassline and synthesizers. According to Rolling Stone, it “drops like dubstep” and “pulses like pop” — a much more nuanced, romantic musical fusion between pop and electronic.
Flume himself has delivered future bass to the masses with original records like “Never Be Like You” and the remix of U.K. garage duo Disclosure’s “You and Me.” One of the most popular examples of original future bass, however, is The Chainsmokers’ 2016 summer anthem “Closer,” co-written with Freddy Kennett of Louis the Child and performed with Halsey. And in the past year, pop and electronic music fans have witnessed the marriage between these two genres with the meteoric rise of artists like Martin Garrix, ODESZA, San Holo and Marshmello — who have all employed the same methodologies used in promoting tropical house to bring future bass into the forefront of our consumption.
Tropical house and future bass are two EDM subgenres changing the landscape of today’s pop music, and at this point, I don’t think there’s anything stopping them from taking over the mainstream. With young and up-and-coming artists like Whethan, Louis the Child and plenty of others starting their careers with future bass jams, it’s almost inevitable that music listeners will not have the same perceptions of EDM as they did throughout its history. 
It’s been fascinating to witness the intermingling of these two worlds, which I initially thought were completely separate. But as it turns out, electronic dance music is no longer just for the rave kids — it’s a malleable genre that has proven its capacity to conquer pop music and culture in its current renaissance.

Earlier this month, in light of the recent sexual harassment scandals involving Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein, social media was flooded with an outpouring of alleged victims of sexual misconduct writing “#MeToo” on their timelines. It all started when actress Alyssa Milano tweeted, “If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote ‘Me too’ as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.” According to Facebook, within 24 hours there were over 12 million “#MeToo” posts, comments and reactions. 
With the #MeToo movement, the conversation has moved from the impersonal world of Hollywood to people’s personal social media accounts, where they see posts from friends, colleagues and even family members. Not only did #MeToo raise awareness about the number of women and men that have fallen victim to sexual assault and harassment, but it also succeeded in illuminating the gray area that surrounds the definition of sexual misconduct. 
Contrary to what many believe, sexual assault and harassment come in far more forms than rape; for example, USC defines sexual harassment as “unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature.” The 2015 USC Climate Survey includes sexual remarks or inappropriate comments in its definition of harassment, as well as inappropriate physical conduct, which approximately 66 percent of undergraduate female survey-respondents said they had experienced. 
The survey demonstrates that sexual misconduct has become normalized to the extent that it’s almost expected to occur when a female student walks near campus at night. Even more alarming is that the physical aspects of assault and misconduct have also seeped into this gray area. Despite the high numbers of female students who have experienced sexual assault or harassment, the 2015 USC Climate Survey noted that an overwhelming majority of survey-takers who experienced sexual assault or misconduct opted not to report the incident to campus officials. Seventy-six percent of females claimed they did not think the nonconsensual touching was “serious” enough to report. In essence, the survey demonstrated that women have become so accustomed to variations of sexual misconduct that much of the time they feel it is not worth reporting. 
#MeToo’s ultimate impact is that it has raised the question of what has caused this behavior to become so normalized. One of the most blatant examples at USC may be a rule on the Panhellenic Council barring sororities from hosting parties with alcohol, sending most underage female students to fraternities. This arguably adds a predatory component to college parties by removing women from safe and comfortable spaces and bringing them into spaces where men hold the power. Since the inception of Greek life at USC, this tradition has stood largely unchallenged. 
Going forward, it is important for women at USC to be aware that what makes them uncomfortable — even if they have been conditioned to perceive this behavior as normal and insignificant — is always “serious” enough to act on or report if they are comfortable doing so. The #MeToo hashtag was so surprising because it showed people how many of their friends had experienced sexual harassment or assault and not told them, perhaps because they did not realize how “serious” their experiences were at the time. Anything that makes someone afraid or uncomfortable should not be delegitimized. 
Exposed by #MeToo, the prevalence of sexual harassment directed at women in vulnerable positions almost seems like a natural component that goes hand-in-hand with the experience of being a young, college-age woman. The next step is for young men to educate themselves and evaluate how easily their words, actions and behaviors could cross the line into sexual misconduct. Ignorance remains pervasive when it comes to the definitions of sexual harassment and assault, and people of all genders have an obligation to fight this. Whether through bystander intervention, or stepping in when students see sexual assault taking place around them, or through educating ourselves and others, and replicating the openness and candor of #MeToo in our everyday lives, we all must address the issue of targeted sexual misconduct toward young women.
Fun fact: women harass/rape men as often as vice versa, but prosecution targets men only. Read up on Lara Stemple’s “The Sexual Victimization of Men in America.”
Fun fact: that’s blatantly, flagrantly untrue and you should reconsider why you’d be willing to take that stance.
Feel free to read Lara Stemple’s study first, which is based on federal aggregate data. Outdated myths need to die.
Hello, I read Lara Stemple’s “The Sexual Victimization of Men in America”. Very insightful. Stemple’s study shows how men are sexually victimized; however, this victimization goes unrecognized due to our preconception that men cannot be victims, that male victimization is non-existent. The study goes on to show how men are sexually victimized by other men: “inherent in this is a methodological bias that misses many who are at great risk for sexual victimization in the United States: inmates, the vast majority of whom are male”. (Male) Inmates of whom are sexually assaulting other (male) inmates. The study goes on to say how males do not have a narrative to cope with this victimization: “Indeed contemporary social narratives, including jokes about prison rape,(25) the notion that “real men” can protect themselves,(8) and the fallacy that gay male victims likely “asked for it,”26 pose obstacles for males coping with victimization”. The study shows that males are victimized by other males; of course, as you pointed out, the female can still be a perpetrator: “one multiyear analysis of the NCVS household survey found that 46% of male victims reported a female perpetrator”. However, unlike what you claimed, the study shows how same-sex perpetuation (that is men victimizing men) is just as relevant, if not more relevant: “the NISVS found that 79% of self-reported gay male victims identified same-sex perpetrators (34). Ultimately, both men and women are effected by victimization. However, to say that women perpetuate (harass/rape) as much as men is not the intent of the study. The intent is to show that everyone is effected under our social construction; in fact, by reducing the study to what you have is to perpetuate a blaming and victimizing culture.

You are misquoting her study. Lara Stemple’s study found that men and women experience sexual victimization at absolutely equal rates (1.270 million women and 1.267 million men). “Of juveniles reporting staff sexual misconduct, 89% were boys reporting abuse by female staff.” The %46 figure is from an older study which is inaccurate. Stemple has another study, “Sexual Victimization Perpetrated by Women,” which finds that %79 of all men who have experienced rape were coerced by women. This is consistent with more than 300+ studies which found that domestic violence is equally perpetrated by women and men. However, prosecution only targets men because of feminist dogma.

Often buried by the turmoil of health care reform, immigration bans and allegations of collusion with foreign powers, the political sphere contains another pervasive issue: case after case of men silencing, undermining and degrading their female counterparts. From male senators repeatedly interrupting Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, to more recently, Rep. Darrell Issa referring to Rep. Pramila Jayapal as “a gentle lady” consumed by “naivete,” the issue of male voices eclipsing women’s is an ingrained part of politics.
But as prevalent as the issue of men speaking over female colleagues is, another problem arises when men remain silent. Despite an overt and oversized male presence in state assemblies and essentially all positions of power, there’s a pervasive culture of silence that extends from public service to everyday life.
At a time when male presidents, executives, news anchors and thousands of other men sexually harass and assault women, when predominantly male “Bernie Bros” and “Trump Trolls” degrade women on and offline, sexual assault once again dominates the news cycle, with harrowing tales of abuse and countless victims at once horrifying and confounding the country. But almost as disturbing is the silence that follows, from the male perpetrators to male bystanders.
How can you start a dialogue about the one in 12 college men who commits acts that met the legal definition of rape, when 84 percent fail to see their actions as illegal? How can we proactively begin to prevent one in five college women from suffering rape or attempted rape? How can we restructure our organizations and cultures when only 13 percent of military males who are sexually assaulted go on to report the crime, leaving 87 percent of cases not only unsolved but also unheard of?
This silence, whether due to apathy or stigma, spills into other realms of society, juxtaposed with the noise coming from prominent males in politics, entertainment and the news. The real growing divide in America represents the disparity in participation between the common man and men in prominence, the gap between the soundwaves of the overspoken and the silence of the apathetic.
In 2016, while 63.3 percent of women voted, only 59.3 percent of men cast a ballot. And this gender disparity of several percentage points reaches all the way back 1984. Men dominate news networks, editorial pages and the halls of legislatures across the country; only 19.6 percent of Congress is female, and 65.4 percent of news network supervisors are male. But at the most fundamental level, with the building block of democracy, men fail to participate.
This lack of presence spills out into the community as well. A poll commissioned by The Chronicle and New York University’s George H. Heyman Jr. Center for Philanthropy and Fundraising found 71 percent of respondents at nonprofits reported that their CEO was male and 69 percent said that their organization’s board was predominantly male.
Yet this domination and overrepresentation of males at the top of nonprofits hardly trickles down to community engagement for the rest of us men. The same poll revealed 66 percent of respondents reported that their organization’s staff was comprised mostly of women. And according to 2005 data from the Corporation for National and Community Service, 33 percent of females volunteer, compared to only 26.8 percent of males.
And despite a lack of statistics curated for our campus, we see national trends unfolding here as well. My committee for Undergraduate Student Government’s Community Affairs branch last year featured a 4 to 1 ratio of females to males. My Friends and Neighbors volunteer group was 75 percent women, and male applicants to the Service Student Assembly’s Executive Board were a decisive minority. These statistics in isolation may pose as anomalies, but together they represent disconcerting discrepancies in terms of how we males interact with and give back to our communities.
They say actions speak louder than words — but the silence is deafening when we won’t speak up for women in the workplace, when we don’t show up to the polls and when can’t be present in our communities. For males, the “dude discourse” presents more style than substance, but it’s about time we know when to not only sit down but also to stand up, and when not only to take a backseat but also to speak up.

Men are indeed silent. For example, even though women rape/harass men as frequently as vice versa, decades of feminist brainwashing have made it impossible to prosecute women, especially on campuses. Read up on Lara Stemple’s “The Sexual Victimization of Men in America.”
