Retired General David H. Petraeus delivered the keynote address at an annual USC dinner honoring veterans and ROTC students Tuesday night. The event, held at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and hosted by President C. L. Max Nikias and Board of Trustees Chairman Edward Roski, marked Petraeus’s first public appearance since he admitted to involvement in an extramarital affair and subsequently resigned as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in November.

Petraeus made international headlines last fall after it was reported that he’d had an affair with Paula Broadwell, his biographer. Further investigation by the FBI resulted in a full-blown media scandal. Aware of the controversy left in his wake, Petraeus was quick to acknowledge in last night’s speech the circumstances that led to his stepping down. “Needless to say, I join you keenly aware that I am regarded in a different light now than I was a year ago,” said Petraeus, speaking to a room of more than 600 guests. “Please allow me to begin my remarks this evening by reiterating how deeply I regret — and apologize for — the circumstances that led me to resign from the CIA and caused such pain for my family, friends and supporters.”
The main points of Petraeus’s address, however, dealt not with the incidents leading to his resignation, but with the general theme of helping veterans and the families of military personnel.  The highly decorated four-star general, who received praise for the primary role he played in stabilizing Iraq with U.S. and allied troops, stressed the importance of adhering to four main goals: to work with the families of fallen soldiers, to care for those wounded in combat, to aid in the transition from military service to the civilian sector and to recognize and honor all veterans.
Petraeus emphasized the difficulties faced by service members returning from combat overseas. “War changes everyone who has experienced it firsthand,” Petraeus said. “In some cases the changes are positive. But many others come home scarred and wounded. This group includes, of course, those with physical scars. It also includes those with the so-called ‘unseen wounds,’ in particular post-traumatic stress and other mental health challenges. We must work to help all veterans.”
The message of veteran support felt appropriate given USC’s long history in helping the military. Along with Notre Dame, USC remains one of the only schools in the country that has maintained an unbroken relationship with ROTC since the USC chapter was established in 1943. Through various initiatives, USC enrolls about 450 veterans every semester, fulfilling what Petraeus considers an “obligation to help those who’ve served.”
Following Petraeus’ address, Nikias gave the general a pair of silver USC cuff links and commended Petraeus on his service to the country. “In our post 9/11 world, General Petraeus’ influence on our military is unmatched, and his contributions to the CIA are far-reaching,” Nikias said. “General Petraeus completely reshaped American military tactics and promoted our nation’s counter-insurgency strategy.”
Many ROTC students spoke to the effectiveness of the address as they exited the ballroom. “It’s great that he has a positive outlook on helping veterans when they return home,” said Monica Laporte, a freshman studying human biology who plans to enter the Marine Corps.
“I like how much support and appreciation he showed to what USC is doing,” said Anthony Trombley, a fifth-year who plans on entering the Air Force. “I’m glad to see that the school’s efforts to benefit veterans have been recognized by such a prominent figure.”
Indeed, USC’s many veteran assistance initiatives went duly noted by the general. “The leadership of the Trojan nation understands and is intent on meeting its share of the responsibilities. For all that USC does, I want to say thank you,” Petraeus said.
zman…I agree with you completely…makes me a little ashamed to call myself a trojan after inviting this scumbag onto our campus
pretty sad that the school would invite this criminal..

The USC football team took to the field for practice Tuesday for the first time following spring break.
Sophomore quarterback and incumbent starter Max Wittek, who is coming off a knee injury sustained two weeks ago, returned to action and got back into the thick of the battle for the starting quarterback job.

“I felt like Cybertron out here with two knee braces, but I felt good overall,” Wittek said. “I think it’s natural to be sore after sitting off of it for three weeks.”
Wittek’s injury meant more reps for sophomore Cody Kessler and freshman early admit Max Browne, but Wittek remained focused on his task at hand. When asked about the quarterback competition, Wittek said he wouldn’t be surprised if head coach Lane Kiffin didn’t name a starting quarterback by the end of spring.
“USC is built on competition, and competition gets the best out of everyone,” Wittek said. “It’s important for us to feel like we’re competing against each other all the way.”
Wittek’s teammate and Biletnikoff Award-winning sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee was also sidelined over the break but, unlike Wittek, he was not cleared to practice.
“I’m OK, probably a little bit sore here and there, but I’m able to go,” Lee said. “Coach Kiffin [said] there’s no need to rush it — he gave me a little extra day off.”
Lee did have a personal milestone to celebrate today, however, as he was enshrined with a plaque on the Trojans’ All-American Walk for his efforts during the 2012 season.
“I was super happy just to accomplish it,” Lee said. “The thing about it is I’m not done, though. It would have been great if I got it as I left; I didn’t. So now … that plaque is motivation … by me having the next two years now I really gotta compete and make sure I let everybody know why I’m on that wall.”
Despite injury issues with two of its biggest stars on offense, the defense stole the show in practice on Tuesday.
“Very defensive-dominated throughout the day, especially by the front seven,” Kiffin said, referring to the defensive line and linebackers. “In both units, but the first team front seven especially.”
The Trojan defense appears to be taking shape under the tutelage of new defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast. Pendergast was not as impressed with the play of the defensive line, stressing the importance of developing consistency.
“It’s kind of been a roller coaster for the whole group,” Pendergast said. “Just when I’m expecting a guy to be consistent, he’s not, so it’s kind of been an up-and-down group so far.”
One player fighting to be more consistently on the “up” side was sophomore defensive lineman Leonard Williams. As a defensive tackle for the Trojans in 2012, the play of Williams and senior defensive end Morgan Breslin was one of the bright spots on a heavily criticized defensive unit.
The 6-foot-5 Williams has moved to defensive end, the position he played in high school, and hopes to make more of an impact in the pass rush in the coming year. Williams, who is officially listed at 270 pounds, stated he was 285 pounds during the season but appears to have gained more muscle.
“I feel faster and [have] more endurance,” Williams said. “Last year by this time I’d be worn out and ready to go to sleep, but I’m just fine right now.”
When asked about what he is striving to achieve next season, Williams brushed off any personal goals and pointed to the Trojan tradition of strong defensive lines.
“Just play good as a whole D-line,” Williams said. “I just want us to look like a good D-line, like the Wild Bunch.”
The “Wild Bunch II” moniker, originally named after the Sam Peckinpah film The Wild Bunch, was appended to the hellacious Trojan defensive line of 2002-03, which included now-NFL player Mike Patterson and defensive ends Omar Nazel and Kenechi Udeze.
With a maturing defensive line and Sports Illustrated All-American honorable mention Breslin returning for his senior year, the thought of a “Wild Bunch III” in the coming season is an enticing possibility.

For a USC wrestling team that did not exist a year ago, the 2013 season has been full of milestones.
To begin the season, the Trojans were officially recognized by the National Collegiate Wrestling Association, allowing them to compete at the National Junior College Athletic Association, NCAA, National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics and National Collegiate Wrestling Association levels.
Practice makes perfect · The USC wrestling team was only able to practice twice a week as per Recreation Club Council restrictions. – Photo courtesy of USC wrestling
 
And in its first year competing at a higher level, the team made history by sending two wrestlers to nationals, one of whom became the first NCWA All-American winner from USC.
At the beginning of the month, the Trojans sent six wrestlers to Riverside, Calif. to compete in the West Coast Conference Championships. The team fared well, placing fourth overall among teams from the WCC, which includes Sacramento State, UC Santa Barbara, Utah, Utah State and 2013 NCWA champion, Cal Baptist.
Four of the six Trojans who competed in the tournament qualified for nationals: freshman Nick Cegelski at the 149-pound weight class, sophomore Armand Farrokh at 157, freshman Dennis Ruan at 197 and freshman Kevin Kang at 285.
Though all four made history by becoming the first USC wrestlers to ever compete in the postseason, USC was only able to send Cegelski and Farrokh to the national championships in Allen, Texas, because of budget constraints.
“For Nick and I to be going alone to Texas as the first two national competitors in USC history was a daunting thought, but it felt amazing,” Farrokh said. “I finally felt that I had some attachment to USC and that I was representing the Trojan family.”
Cegelski and Farrokh led USC to 45th place out of 90 teams at the NCWA Championships. Farrokh had an explosive start to open up the tournament, pinning his first opponent, Moises Lopez of the University of Texas-Pan American, in just one minute and 32 seconds to advance to the next round. Next, he fell in a hard-fought match to Danny Apgar of Northwest Missouri State. In the consolation round, Farrokh was defeated by Hunter Allen of Mercer.
Cegelski also had an impressive tournament, placing sixth out of 38 wrestlers in his weight class and earning NCWA All-American honors, to become the first Trojan in history to do so. In the first round, Cegelski defeated Mason Macfarlane of Eastern Washington University 5-2. Then, he was defeated 3-2 in overtime by Peter Crawford of Liberty University. Cegelski bounced back in the consolation rounds by overtaking Evan Burchette of Mercer 7-1, then Vincent Camps of Slippery Rock 4-2. Next, he bested Max Becks of Central Florida 11-9 to clinch All-American status. He went on to win a 6-5 overtime decision over Air Force Prep’s Gerald McGinty before falling to Jesse Freise of Lindenwood and Kyle Spruill of The Apprentice School.
“A year ago, I wouldn’t have believed you if you’d told me I’d be wrestling, let alone be gaining All-American status in the NCWA nationals,” Cegelski said. “My accomplishment is a result of thousands of hours of incredibly hard work by my coaches, my teammates, the team managers and my parents. At the end of the day, I could not be prouder to represent USC to the abilities I did.”
The team’s success might surprise some people, as it seems the odds were stacked against the Trojans this season. Though some of the schools they competed against have full varsity programs that practice daily under a full-time coaching staff, the Trojans are only allowed to practice on mats two days a week because of Recreation Club Council restrictions for club teams. Additionally, the wrestlers themselves are responsible for scheduling their matches and arranging for transportation and lodging. Unlike athletes from varsity programs, USC’s wrestlers are not able to focus on wrestling all the time.
The Trojans overcame these obstacles this season and hope to continue to make progress in the upcoming seasons and eventually become a premier NCWA team.
“It’s easy to be timid and think that we could never be anything but a club, but that’s not the route we’ve taken,” USC head coach Wes Fulkerson said. “We’re building and we want to be able to compete with the best.”
Lacrosse has nothing to do with this…
Like I said, even lacrosse laughs at you
Idk man…you don’t wanna mess with wrestlers!
Don’t worry Mark, when I was in high school as a wrestler, people used to write it off as a “fruity” sport. But many don’t realize that almost all fist-fights end up on the ground, in which a wrestler has like 95% of the control. And after the wrestler controls you on the ground in a “mount” position, let the ground n’ pound, elbows to the face and what not begin. It isn’t coincidence that the top level MMA fighters i.e. Jon Jones, Benson Henderson, Cain Valsquez, and many others have freestyle/folk wrestling as their base…
What’s the room for everybody keeps mentioning?  More intimate setting?
Funny how even lacrosse players laugh at wrestling….
They might laugh but it wouldn’t happen if they were near a wrestling mat.
to USC parent,
We used to have a wrestling room. PE building, basement, SW corner. Small but functional.
Really? Could you shoot me a message on Facebook? Perhaps we could work to get the room back.
Keep up the good work guys. I have a 15 year old who placed 3rd in CIF and went 2-2 in Masters and then he hears his favorite college has wrestling…. Pure Joy ….. And then my 9 year old who is a junior Trojan and wrestler says he is verbally committing to USC now…. Within 5 years we will be competing for national wrestling title… Go Trojans
Hey Haden, give ’em some money.
Congrats on your success. Looking forward to seeing the growth of the team in roster size and mat success.

Take downs, escapes, nearfalls and pins! that’s what it’s all about baby. So proud of how SC got the ball rolling, and even some wrestlers placing at tournaments. If the football and basketball programs are going to go through a down period, then let’s at least see SC wrestling rise. 
Penn State, Iowa, OSU watch out! Trojan wrestling is coming for ya!!!!!!
Why can’t they practice as much?
Wow! Somebody get these kids a wrestling room! A group of kids working this hard deserves to have a place to train on a daily basis. Wrestling is t a 2x a week sport! 
Great job guys!

What if USC had made the NCAA tournament?
A silly hypothetical, I know. The Trojans were nowhere near qualified enough to make it to March Madness. They were an average basketball team at best, with an interim coach at the helm to boot.
But it’s the last week of March — we have Cinderella teams like Florida Gulf Coast University, La Salle and Wichita State in the Sweet 16 after knocking out a couple of powerhouse squads. As brackets are busted across the nation, it’s the ultimate “what if” period for basketball junkies.
So, let’s say the Trojans didn’t lose to the Utah Utes in the opening round of the Pac-12 tournament in Las Vegas. In fact, let’s assume USC went on a miraculous run and won the conference championship. How many teams could the Trojans realistically defeat with their newly minted automatic bid?
Probably not many. USC finished 2-11 against teams that qualified for the tournament — its two wins were against the UCLA Bruins on Jan. 30 and the Arizona Wildcats on Feb. 27. Both of those teams entered the tournament as a six seed, which is a good indicator of the maximum level of competition this Trojan team was capable of pulling an upset against.
Of course, as Florida Gulf Coast proved in its victory over second-seeded Georgetown, sometimes you can throw all the statistics in the world out the window. But, in general, this tournament has been devoid of major surprises, contrary to the Cinderella stories making headlines.
The West region is all over the place with a nine seed (Wichita State) facing off against a 13 seed (La Salle) and a six seed (Arizona) taking on a two seed (Ohio State), but the rest of the tournament has gone pretty much according to plan. The East region still has its top four seeds intact. The Midwest features the top three seeds and 12-seeded Oregon, a team that should’ve easily been ranked higher. The South region is more of the same — three of the top four seeds remain.
USC would have a fighting chance in its first matchup mostly because of its streaky shooting. Under interim head coach Bob Cantu, the Trojans scored 50 points in their first meeting against the Wildcats and 89 points in their rematch. If players like junior guard J.T. Terrell got hot early, it’s definitely not inconceivable to think the team could’ve at least made it interesting in the round of 64. Terrell is more than capable of dropping 25 points on virtually anyone. Temple’s Khalif Wyatt exuded that very quality, as the senior guard dropped back-to-back 31 point games and nearly brought the Owls to the Sweet 16.
When you play the odds though, there are few teams you could pick out as easy wins for the Trojans. I would assume USC could defeat any of the 16-seeds, probably by double-digits. After that, nothing is guaranteed. The Trojans lost to some pretty average teams this year, including Nebraska and Georgia (albeit during the Kevin O’Neill era). On paper, they’re more talented than Florida Gulf Coast. They’re probably more talented than plenty of other double-digit seeds, especially mid-major squads who didn’t face off against nearly as much stiff competition. But that talent just didn’t seem to mesh during the regular season. Not only that — even a conference title wouldn’t save the Trojans from being one of the lowest seeds in the tournament. They’d likely get an unfavorable matchup against one of the best teams in the country. Other than that home win against Arizona, the Trojans were unable to beat a single ranked team in the regular season.
Still, it’s not like USC was in the easiest conference in the world. The Pac-12 champion Oregon Ducks, woefully underseeded in the NCAA tournament, easily beat Oklahoma State and Saint Louis. The Arizona Wildcats, a team USC defeated, blew out Belmont and Harvard. The conference as a whole is 5-3 in the field of 68, one of the better marks in college basketball.
When it comes down to it, even a dream scenario in which the Trojans swept through the Pac-12 tournament into March Madness just wouldn’t have ended well. A first-round upset would’ve been possible, but definitely not plausible. And beyond that, there would’ve been practically zero chance of a Florida Gulf Coast-esque run against some of the nation’s best squads.

The No. 4-ranked USC women’s sand volleyball team could not keep up with defending champion Pepperdine, as it fell Tuesday to the No. 1-ranked Waves 4-1 in the final regular-season home contest at Merle Norman Stadium on Tuesday.
The Women of Troy (9-3) put themselves in a hole early, dropping the No. 4 and No. 5 matches in the first round of play. In the No. 5-ranked match, the pair of junior Sam Hirschmann and sophomore Alexa Stonish fell to Pepperdine’s Katie Messing and Emily Cook in straight sets, 21-12, 21-19. The No. 4-ranked match had the same result, as the Waves’ Victoria Adelheim and Taylor Racich swept the USC pair of junior Brooke Fournier and senior Natasa Siljkovic 21-16, 21-13.
Not quite enough · The No. 5 duo of junior Sam Hirschmann and sophomore Alexa Stonish (above) came up short against Pepperdine’s Katie Messing and Emily Cook, 21-12, 21-19. USC lost the match by a score of 4-1. — Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
“Ultimately, the difference was that we didn’t stay in the match,” said USC head coach Anna Collier. “We put ourselves in a hole and would get behind early in our matches, and playing catch up is very tough to do.”
The overall team match was clinched by Pepperdine in the No. 1-ranked pairing with the USC team of graduate student Stevi Robinson and junior Kirby Burnham falling to the Waves in straight sets, 21-13. 21-19.
With the win, Pepperdine (6-0) stays undefeated on the season and has never dropped a dual team match.
In the No. 3-ranked match, the Waves’ Kelley Larsen and Kellie Woolever would put Pepperdine up 4-0 with another perfect match over the USC pair of sophomores Eve Ettinger and Bria Russ, 21-14, 21-17.
Though the match was already decided, USC would fight back in the No. 2-ranked match, looking to prevent the Pepperdine sweep. USC’s pair of senior Katie Fuller and freshman Cinnamon Sary dropped the first set 21-13 to the Waves’ Lara Dykstra and Racich.
The Waves had gone four-and-a-half sets without a single loss and were poised for another sweep, but the Trojans’ Fuller and Sary had other plans. The two would narrowly claim the second set 22-20. In the third set, they ended the dual on a high note, winning 15-13 to take the match.
“The match was a lot closer than the score indicated,” Collier said. “We just need to stick to playing our game and not getting caught up early in our matches.”
The Trojans will get another shot at the Waves during the regular season when they travel up to Malibu on April 6. With Tuesday’s loss, USC is 0-3 all-time against Pepperdine, with two of those losses coming in its inaugural season in 2012.
“We need to take care of our side of the court better,” Collier said. “We have a game plan and we just need to execute that game plan using our fundamentals.”
The Women of Troy finished the regular season with a home record of 7-3. However, USC will play an exhibition match at home against the USA National Beach Team on April 27.
The road ahead does not get much easier for the Women of Troy as they are set to travel away from the comfort of Merle Norman Stadium to take on No. 2-ranked Long Beach State on Thursday. First serve is set for 1 p.m.

The university’s undergraduate admission center and enrollment services team mailed out acceptance letters Tuesday night to more than 45,000 Trojan hopefuls.
The acceptance rate for this year’s applicants was 19.6 percent, down from 20 percent from last year. The admitted students come from more than 3,100 different high schools across the world. One out of every nine students accepted is the first in their family to attend college.
According to the university’s Office of Undergraduate Admission office, the newly admitted students have diverse backgrounds. Sixty-four percent of the students from the class of 2017 are students of color, while international students comprise 17 percent of the admitted students.
Many students come from California. Other highly represented states include Texas, Illinois, New York, Washington and Massachusetts. Most of the admitted international students hail from China, South Korea, India, Canada and Singapore.
The students have high academic accolades and achievements, according to the USC Undergraduate  Office of Admission The standardized test scores of 75 percent of the admitted students were in the 95th percentile; in addition, the average admitted student had an unweighted high school grade point average of 3.8 on a 4.0 scale. The accepted students also took an average of six to eight advanced placement classes during their time in high school.
Admitted students have until May 1 to accept the admission decision.
Pike is far more selective and only takes 1 out of 100
I think USC accepted a much much larger number of appeals last and bumped up many more spring admits to fall than they typically do. Their yield rate turned out to be lower than expected due to the switch to the common app, and as such the final Fall admission rate went up by a couple percentage points. This is all rumors though, I could be totally wrong.
However, people with rejection letters this year could let us know how many appeals were accepted last year. Usually appeals stand around a 5% chance. How was it last year?
Why did USC state that last year the acceptance rate was 18% down from 22%, yet this year the acceptance rate is 19.6% down from 20% and a decrease over last year? 
Another great job from the incompetent Daily Trojan. 
Does anyone from this newspaper go on into the field of journalism or is this just a gimme class? Some one needs to overhaul this piece of c..p newspaper.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Monday, March 25, and Tuesday, March 26. 
Crimes against a person
At 3:00 a.m. on March 26, DPS officers responded to a student who reported from the Delta Chi fraternity house that she was sexually assaulted. The crime did not occur there.
Crimes against property
At 9:16 P.M. on March 25, DPS officers responded to a report from a student that said he and his friend confronted two suspects after seeing the suspects remove their cellular phones while they were running on the track at Dean Bartlett Cromwell Field. The suspects returned the phones, then fled in a waiting vehicle.  DPS officers responded to the call to conduct an investigation, but they were unable to determine if a crime had occurred because the two students did not cooperate with the officers.
At 1:11 P.M. on March 25, DPS officers responded to a student report that a suspect climbed through an open window to gain entry and removed five watches, two bottles of alcohol and a pair of sunglasses from 1150 30th St.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 4:24 P.m. on March 25, DPS officers responded to a staff member who injured her wrist, back, shoulders and buttocks when she slipped and fell inside the Carol Little Building. An LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #84 responded.  The RA Unit examined the staff member, then transported her to California Hospital for medical treatment.
I will be searching for tips on the way to boost the quantity of comments by myself website, precisely how have you reach your goals in achieving this?
According to DPS and the University, the Daily Trojan is factually incorrect in its reporting.  The report of a sexual assault occurred at Kappa Kappa Gamma and Delta Chi was not involved.
Hello —
We received the original incorrect report from DPS, who had made an error in naming Delta Chi as the location. The Daily Trojan noted this correction in print. 
Best,
Rachel Bracker
Managing editor
Who do we get to sue for this misinformation? 
Will USC threaten to close down Kappa for letting this happen on their property?
Perhaps it would make sense to correct this information in the online article as well, instead of misreporting a sexual assault?  Although I suppose this is the quality of the reporting the Daily Trojan is known for.
Another reason to close the row!  How many incidents do we need before the administration takes action?
What was a girl doing at Delta Chi?  Did she get lost or walk in the wrong house?

Samuel Levine, a senior majoring in psychology who was known for his thoughtfulness and optimism, died of severe head trauma on March 19 while vacationing in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico during spring break. He was 22.
According to KTLA, Mexican authorities say Levine fell six stories after climbing onto an air conditioning unit outside of his hotel room. The exact circumstances of his death, however, are unclear; Claire Becker, Levine’s girlfriend and a sophomore majoring in international relations and narrative studies, says he fell through an unstable part of the roof of a hotel.
Passionate Trojan · Classmates of Levine said he influenced those in his life with his thoughtful comments and graceful confidence. — Courtesy of RIP Sam Levine Facebook page
Levine was born and raised in Oak Park, Calif., by his parents Michael and Debra Levine. He had two older brothers named Ryan and Andrew.
“They have a really tight-knit family. All his relatives live nearby. They are the type of family that doesn’t judge, they are so accepting,” Becker said. “The first time I met Sam’s dad, Michael, he told me that his wife and boys were his best friends and the reason he lived.”
Levine attended Oak Park High School, where he was a three-year varsity basketball player. He won the Tri-Valley League Most Valuable Player in his senior year in 2009.
Sean Spear, a friend of Levine and a senior majoring in public policy, management and planning, said Levine was kind- hearted and thoughtful.
“He was elected four times in a row for homecoming king, but was such a humble guy that he never wanted the spotlight on him,” Spear said. “He would always encourage his friends to vote for the other guys.”
After graduating from high school, Levine showed his commitment to his community and his love for sports by returning to OPHS to coach the freshman and sophomore basketball team.
Levine attended Moorpark College for one year before transferring to USC in 2010 as a sophomore.
“Sam’s dream was to go to USC and that’s why we connected so well,” Spear said. “For Sam, there was nothing about USC that he wasn’t in love with. Everything he wanted in his college experience he got at USC. I remember him telling me he felt he was truly blessed to go to such a fine university.”
Many of his friends remembered Levine for his strong sense of school spirit.
“He was a proud Trojan,” said Justin Silber, one of Levine’s roommates and a senior majoring in business administration. “He wanted to go to USC his entire life. He loved Los Angeles. He was a Southern California kid.”
Levine was an active member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. His fraternity brothers, who held a memorial for Levine Monday night, said he touched several lives during his time in the fraternity.
“He was always quick to smile — very lighthearted, very kind, very caring — and probably one of the most genuine people I know,” said Ryan Park, a member of Sigma Chi . “[He was] always there if you wanted to talk about something heavy and always willing to give advice.”
Becker also endearingly described his infectious personality.
“I fell in love with him the first time I saw him,” Becker said. “He was so classy and such a gentleman and he was so charismatic that just looking at him made me smile. Everything that came out of his mouth was so thoughtful. He was very calm and collected and radiated confidence but not arrogance at all.  I don’t think he knew how incredible he was, but everyone else could see it.”
Levine was especially passionate about athletics.
He was a practice player on the USC’s women’s basketball team his sophomore year and was a marketing director for the men’s baseball team his junior year. Upon graduation, Levine had his sights set on the sports industry.
“He was looking to combine all the things he loved and had learned: sports, psychology and marketing,” Silber said.
Levine’s friends said because his zeal for life resonated with many people, his impact will be felt forever.
“In 22 years, Sam Levine was able to touch more people than others do in a lifetime,” Spear said. “He was a guy who truly made the world a better place. He will be dearly missed but I know his spirit will live on through all those who have been touched by knowing him.”
Silber said the death of his roommate has left the community in shock.
“It’s been a really somber and sobering experience realizing how good of a person we had,” Silber said. “He was the one person everyone loved and the one person everyone respected,”
 
Levine’s funeral will be held today at 10 a.m. at Pierce Brothers Memorial Park in Westlake Village, Calif.

Xinhai Huang, a junior majoring in electrical engineering, was remembered for his intelligence and optimism Tuesday at a memorial in his honor. Huang died March 18 in a car accident about five miles southwest of the University Park Campus. He was 22 years old.
In addition to being an honors student on the Dean’s List, Huang was an avid rock climber, a son and a friend to many.
安息. 昕海 · Yoshika Masuda plays the cello with the message “Rest in Peace, Xinhai” hanging behind him at the memorial on Tuesday night. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Justin Wayne Rawls, Huang’s best friend and rock-climbing partner, said his contagious smile always spread to everyone who encountered him.
“He was always so positive and always had the biggest smile on his face,” Rawls said. “He made sure that I knew how to love life.”
Huang’s sense of humor was just as contagious. Ethan Chan, a junior majoring in electrical engineering, recalled the many times when Huang made him laugh.
“I met him freshman year and got to know him more sophomore year,” Chan said. “He loved to joke around with everyone. He was a great person to be around.”
Mary M. Eshaghian-Wilner, one of Huang’s electrical engineering professors, said Huang’s death was a huge loss to everyone.
“He was a brilliant, great student,” Eshaghian-Wilner said. “I’ve been trying to deal with it with my students. It’s a very difficult loss.”
Rami Mazid, a junior majoring in electrical engineering and a classmate of Huang, said his absence will be felt by all who knew him both in and out of the classroom.
“We did a lot of work together, and we always helped each other out,” Mazid said. “He was [one of] the smartest people I knew by far. His passing was a loss for all of us.”
Those who knew Huang remember him most for his optimism, even in the face of challenges.
“I’ve never seen him down,” Chan said. “Though school may get hard and busy, he always worked through it.”
Viterbi School of Engineering Dean Yannis Yortsos comforted students by comparing life to Huang’s passion for rock climbing in his speech at the memorial.
“Your world is literally upside down, and you are tightening your arms and fingertips the entire time as you climb. The only way to move forward is to blindly leap with faith through the air,” Yortsos said.
Vice President of Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson said Huang’s time at USC was one filled with true friendships.
“He wanted to build lifetime friendships with the people he met at USC and around the world,” Jackson said. “I know that he cherished his memories with all of you more than you can possibly imagine.”
In addition to being a beloved member of the Trojan Family, Huang was also a beloved son. Huang’s father, Yuejiang Huang, praised his son for his dedication, diligence and warm spirit.
In a speech in Mandarin addressed to his son, Huang’s father reminisced about his son’s positive nature throughout his short life.
“You were such a good boy,” Huang’s father said according to a printed translation. “Your family and friends all loved you when you were with us. I am grateful that you were beloved by so many people throughout your short-lived life.”
Huang’s father concluded his statement by thanking those within the Trojan community who supported the family following Huang’s death.
“I would like to express my appreciation toward everyone who had helped and taken care of Xinhai,” Huang’s father said. “I hope all of Xinhai’s friends will continue to live their lives with health and happiness.”
Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni urged those in attendance to remember Huang’s legacy.
“Let us be inspired by his life, and let us recognize that we are all deeply connected in miracle and in mystery to this university, to this community and to each other,” Soni said.

Of green tea Arnold Palmers and doughnut sandwiches.
Ever eaten a savory sandwich on a doughnut bun? Yes, a DOUGHNUT bun! Now, before you write the idea off, or conjure up thoughts of sugary, glazed, fried dough surrounding your sandwich fillings, hold that thought. Things are not always what they seem, but not necessarily in a bad way.
Fickle & The Sandwich Smith recently opened in Little Tokyo and is located on East 1st Street. The sandwich-shop-meets-bakery concept was inspired by a San Francisco counterpart, and sells custom-built, expertly crafted sandwiches in the Japanese Village Plaza in downtown Los Angeles.
When you walk in, go straight to the counter to fill out a form and start building your own sandwich on paper. Then, wielding your edible master plan, head to the register to make your sandwich dreams a reality. There, you can choose to get a combo, which comes with a side and a drink. If you can’t decide between the green tea and their freshly made lemonade, try an off-the-menu green tea version of an Arnold Palmer by asking them to combine the two. The ice cold drink is delicious and refreshing, and a great complement to the hot and hearty sandwiches.
I customized my Dr. Pepper pulled pork sandwich with cheddar cheese, BBQ sauce, pickled red onions, and a creamy coleslaw. I chose another coleslaw, this time with bacon vinaigrette, as my third free topping on the side, heeding the cashier’s advice, and ordered the tofu-kale salad as the side to my combo. This led to quite a bit of food, but the common thread with all of it is that it was high-quality and made with fresh ingredients. The tofu-kale salad even had cranberries in it, which added a nice sweet and tart element to the dish.
Now, for the moment you may have been waiting for all along: when unwrapping the sandwich, what can you expect? The doughnut bun looks kind of like a baked bread bun, and is definitely not sweet, nor does it have a hole in the center. However, it is freshly baked and soft, complementing the fillings in the sandwich. So as long as you don’t expect your sandwich to be served on a typical glazed doughnut, you’ll probably enjoy it.
I also highly recommend checking in on Yelp for a free pastry. I fulfilled my glazed doughnut craving this way, and boy, did it satisfy. The fluffy pillow of raised dough was bite after bite of yeasty goodness, with the perfect amount of sweetness.
The restaurant is clean and bright inside, and at night the mood shifts to a slightly fancier, more romantic ambiance. The staff is super friendly and attentive, and is always up for giving their own recommendations when asked.
They even validate for parking in the Japanese Village Plaza structure, in case you needed yet another reason to try it out.
For more information on Fickle & The Sandwich Smith, you can check out thesandwichsmith.com.
What are your thoughts on doughnut buns and Fickle & The Sandwich Smith? Stay tuned for another foodie find next Tuesday, here at Tanaya’s Table. (Feel free to tweet me at @MsTanayaG)

Undergraduate Student Government unanimously voted Tuesday to pass a resolution that mandates the university administration to actively investigate the Facebook page USC Hook-Ups and determine what further action is needed to address the negative impacts of the page.
The Facebook page was launched on Feb. 11 by anonymous creators, and submission posts are anonymous. The page has over 1,600 likes so far. On the page, the creators urge their users to “Comment with your craziest story, raunchiest hookup, or best one night stand.”
The page has inspired 157 posts so far, most of which describe intimate and graphic details of student encounters at parties and events. The explicit nature of the posts has prompted student organizations, such as USG, to call for university interference.
Residential senators Maheen Sahoo and Jasmine McAllister worked with the Co-Director of Diversity Affairs and Assistant Director of the Women’s Student Assembly Anh Phan and Jackson Burgess, a sophomore majoring in English and narrative studies, to author the resolution.
Sahoo said that Phan approached her with worries about the page and wanted to write a resolution that would call for university intervention.
“One of my problems with this page is that the negative material posted is celebrated and rarely contested,” Phan said. “This page contains the most horrific conversations between students and other Facebook users and paints a negative portrait of our university.”
The resolution says the derogatory and explicit nature of the posts on the page is detrimental to the image of the university. The page is viewable to any Facebook user, including prospective students, parents, alumni and members of the general public, Sahoo said.
“Our reputation as an institution is undoubtedly suffering as a result,” Sahoo said. “To me, making sure that we foster a safe, tolerant and welcoming atmosphere in the USC community, whether in person or online, is of utmost importance.”
Because a number of posts on the page allude to users engaging in possible sexual assault, the resolution argues that the page does not support the USC Code of Conduct’s Policy and Procedures on Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Assault.
The authors also said possible victims of assault might be traumatized by the public exposure. They said this exposure could be potentially interfering with their healing process.
“The page expresses sexist, homophobic and racist sentiments toward, but not limited to, members within the USC community but also other communities at large,” Phan said. “We should not be circulating such content as educated, open-minded individuals.”
Student opposition to the USC Hook-Ups Facebook Page has resulted in a Facebook event titled “Report USC Hook-Ups to Facebook.” The event has more than 250 confirmed attendees so far.
Zoe Sanchez, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering, agreed that the page was not representative of the culture on campus and negatively impacts on the school’s image.
“People are using this page to post truly demeaning and often untrue stories,” Sanchez said. “It will really reflect badly on the morals and actions of the overall student body.”
Some students, however, said the university does not need to play a role in ending the Facebook page.
“People have the choice of posting,” said Ian Wilkerson, a sophomore majoring in communication. “A lot of other universities have similar pages. To think sexual activity doesn’t happen in college is crazy.”
The resolution calls the administration to investigate the page and limit its negative impacts. The USC Center for Women and Men also urges the administration to ensure that the page will not taint the reputation of the university by encouraging abusive behaviors.
“The creation of the page isn’t our school administration’s fault, and we certainly aren’t blaming it by drafting this resolution, but if our administrators care as much we do about ending this page’s propagation of sexism, homophobia and misogyny, they will work with us to appropriately address the problem,” Sahoo said.
 
Hahahaha. The fact that people care is ridiculous. Anyone heard of free speech?
I agree with Alex’s statement, “these crimes and hookups will happen whether or not they are on this site, and the site will likely just take another, slightly more private, form even if administration pressure forces the closure of the page.”
The resolution doesn’t call for the closure of the page; it was written to simply get USC’s attention on the issue. (So this headline is inaccurate.) USC has a HUGE problem of sexual assault and this resolution is one of several campaigns to get them to admit it and then to take steps to create a safer campus.
I’m not against sexual activity. I am against rape, sexual assault and harassment, misogyny, racism, and homophobia. All of which have appeared and have even been celebrated on this page.
When the page moderators post degrading and/or violent stories, and people make comments speaking out against this stuff, the moderators usually censor their comments. As a result, the page doesn’t foster an open or positive forum about sexuality. It creates a “safe space” for hateful bullshit.
Here’s one of the worst posts, which has since been deleted without comment. Covering their tracks much?
“#85 My date just woke me up by asking what happened last night. She doesn’t remember anything and asked if she cheated on her boyfriend. I said definitely. She cried and walked home.”

Am I supposed to feel sympathy for the ho?  I don’t!
Say that when it’s your sister getting raped, Billy. Prick.
My sister isn’t a ho
After reading this article I went to this Facebook page only to be stunned by sexual depravity described by USC students.   It is truly disgusting what some have chosen to share online.   Despite what is proudly proclaimed on this page, I know for a fact that not everyone on the row is taking part in SC’s own online version of Sodom and Gomorrah.  There are still men of integrity on the row who don’t partake in this disgusting behavior.  
I only hope those that have forsaken their morals for the sins of the flesh turn back from the darkness that fills their hearts and find peace in His word!
God Bless!
Hi Alex,
Thank you for your input and adding a different perspective to the conversation, and I completely agree with you that we as a community need to step up our efforts to be more aware of what sexual assault is and prevent it.
Just to clarify, the resolution itself does not attack the Greek system. If you would like me to email you the resolution that was passed by the USG Senate last night, please contact me.

the row brings in an amazing number of prospectives and also donations from alumni each year. Administrations at other schools where greek life is much less entrenched have backed out of trying to ban their greeks after they discovered just how many donations they would lose.
This article seems to be full of bias. Is it really that hard to find someone who doesn’t think USC Hookups is the spawn of the devil? the only conflicting opinion in this piece comes at the very end, bracketed with the language “Some students, however, said the university does not need to play a role in ending the Facebook page.” Is this because the author took a representative sample of students and questioned their opinions via impersonal, unbiased survey and then found that only ‘some’ wanted the school to ban the page? No. It is because the author took a sample of convenience, asking similarly-minded people and simply ignoring any other commentary on the issue. It’s called confirmation bias, and it generally is not allowed in mainstream journalism.
Furthermore, this entire article revolves around a moot point because these crimes and hookups will happen whether or not they are on this site, and the site will likely just take another, slightly more private, form even if administration pressure forces the closure of the page. If USC wants to improve its image, which is fine by me, the administration could start with actual sexual assault prevention measures instead of just blocking a website.
Sorry, the “name” on the above comment should read Jasmine McAllister, not “USG Senate”
Can we please shut down the row at the same time?   Both make us look really bad!
I agree!

It’s time to blow the dust off those books and prepare for post-midterm madness, and this week’s New Noise has just the soundtrack for you. Whether it’s the awaited return of the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club or the awesome simplicity of Colleen Green, the songs featured will help get you off that couch and get down to doing what you have to do.
The best motivation songs are the ones that have the power to erase your memory, making you forget what it is you’re feeling lazy about in the first place and hijacking your attention for a whole three minutes. These tracks only give you back your attention when it’s been fully energized and revved up by the drive of the music.
Straight up in-your-face and loud — if energy could be captured and injected into a soundwave, this week’s tracks would definitely be the results.
Black Rebel Motorcycle Club: “Let The Day Begin”
Let the day begin, indeed. After a three-year break following the release of Beat the Devil’s Tattoo, post-punk/psych-blues darling BRMC released its seventh album in January 2013. “Let the Day Begin” is the band’s version of The Call’s hit track from 1989, and the song is a sure shot to get you moving.
The tune is the perfect way to start a day and does the original version some major justice. BRMC adds its trademark psychedelic touch, and the song ends up sounding as though The Call and the Beatles’ “Tomorrow Never Knows” duked it out in a blender — basically, a great sound. The vocals are clearer than usual, not dripping in distortion like The Club’s vocals often do, and the anthemic lyrics that are basically cheering the world beg to be sung atop Doheny aloud— or in your head, at least.

Colleen Green: “Heavy Shit”
Colleen Green is the latest where-were-you-my-whole-life addition to the indie-music world, and rightly so. Sure, there are great stoner rockers and stoner metal, but perhaps no one has perfected stoner pop as well as Green has.
Her latest release, Sock It To Me, is one of the more minimal albums that have been pressed in a while. The one-chick band rocks a drum machine and a guitar, and if you can count more than three chords in a song, then you should rewind and listen again, because you’re probably wrong.
“Heavy Shit” is one of the deeper songs on the album, and it goes as profound as the chorus: “Heavy shit / on my mind.” Green’s music is unbelievably charming, with upbeat and lo-fi electro-punk beats that sound like Ramones-meets-The-Network on downers.
The poppy sound has the simplicity of garage rock and the DIY ethos of punk, making for a unique style that is so charismatically unpretentious, you can’t help but love it. Some songs you contemplate to, some songs you smile to and but “Heavy Shit” wants you to shut up and pogo.

Grown Up Avenger Stuff:  “Too Cool”
Grown Up Avenger Stuff is as awesome as its name — that’s basically all you need to know. The quartet has a distinctive sound that mixes a bunch of different genres, and “Too Cool” off of Sparkleton is one of the more upbeat songs on the record, serving as a perfect example of the awfully fun head space Grown Up Avenger Stuff puts one into.
Lead singer Deirdre Kroener has the best type of vocals — strong and sweet, but tough enough to make you scared of her in the best way possible. Kroener demands you to “come on and dance” in the chorus, and it’s pretty hard to disobey.
The band’s sound brings back vibes of the multi-genred music wave of the ’90s – the production is earnest and simple, in that the song literally sounds like a quartet playing its song in one take. There’s no frills, no gimmicks and no trimmings — just pure awesomeness.

Her Parents: “Why Don’t You Just F-ck Off”
From the band’s Facebook: “Her Parents are just a great bunch of total friends playing some punk music.”
The description on the band’s Twitter: “great guys.”
It doesn’t get more straightforward than that, and that goes for the band’s music as well. To everyone out there who misses good old fashioned loud and reckless punk rock, Her Parents are just what you’ve been waiting for.
If the last three songs on the list weren’t enough to get you moving, then “Why Don’t You Just F-ck Off” is not only the perfect statement to make to your laziness, but also a straight guarantee to get some blood pumping in you. Just a warning though — this song will kick your ass. And right when you start getting used to it, it’ll kick your ass again.
The track is off of the London band’s upcoming album Happy Birthday, set to drop on May 13 via Alcopop! Records. When the song is over, there are just a couple of things left to do — lather, rinse, repeat.

Technology has given people unparalleled opportunities to socially connect and share information. It is not, however, normally associated with improving one’s physical health. Many spend hours “plugged in” to their tech toys, preferring to stare at a screen than spend time on exercise and outdoor activities.
An apple a day · With a background in health studies, Harsh Vathsangam has come up with an effective way to encourage exercise. – Courtesy of Harsh Vathsangam
Despite this, technology does not have to work against one’s personal well-being. USC doctoral candidate Harshvardhan Vathsangam seeks to harness technology to encourage people to get moving and lead healthier lives through his app.
MeasureMe, Vathsangam’s budding company, has developed a smart and social software-based pedometer and calorie counter that uses the sensors in smartphones to characterize and quantify human movement.
MeasureMe is unlike applications such as Fitbit or Nike+ Fuelband, which burn through a phone’s battery life, making the apps frustrating for some users. Instead, MeasureMe utilizes the sensors in the phone, rather than GPS or any external sensing technique, which means a user can save 10 times as much power on their phone.
“MeasureMe has the potential to greatly improve [ease of use] and brings cost-effective activity monitoring into the pocket of every user,” Vathsangam said.
Vathsangam, who collaborated with Gaurav S. Sukhatme, a professor of computer science at USC who serves as the chair of the Department of Computer Science, has had plenty of experience melding health and technology.
Vathsangam spent four years studying on-body sensing and personal health and previously developed three generations of prototype hardware, building up the data-driven algorithmic framework to bring the product to its current level.
Vathsangam said his ultimate goal when designing his app was to change the way people behave in accordance to physical activity.
In Vathsangam and Sukhatme’s opinion, there are three ways to effectively change people’s behaviors. First, Vathsangam said it is important to correct behavior in real time so that one is conscious of when they revert to bad habits. The second, just as important, is to receive pressure from loved ones.
“When someone feels pressure from people he or she cares about, they are more likely to change his or her behavior in order to receive approval from them,” Vathsangam said.
The third way is by tailoring the application to meet the expectations of each individual.
“There was never a tool to tailor it to specific people until the invention of cell phones,” Vathsangam said. “Everyone has a cell phone, therefore everyone can receive personalized information in order to change their behavior.”
To achieve this, the student-professor team programmed the application to use the power of big data to motivate the user to become more active. The application sends notifications to the user’s cell phone, reminding the user to meet his or her daily goal of exercise.
MeasureMe’s app also encourages friendly competition among users of the app. Users can check on the progress of friends to see how they are doing and keep them inspired.
The chat feature on the application also allows users to send messages back and forth about their exercise for the day.
It’s easy to get lost in the technical bells and whistles of the app, but Vathsangam stressed that at the end of the day, the app is not about the numbers.
“The application allows people to collaborate and encourages competition between friends,” Vathsangam said. “We want to make it an interactive experience for users.
The purpose of this application was to create a social platform that builds off data that people generate in real time in order to induce lifestyle changes.”
The application is in beta right now, but Vathsangam said that his app will be released this summer in mid-May.
I look forward to this app coming out.  It sounds very interesting. Thanks

Before I got around to finishing season two of the notorious HBO dramedy Girls, I had already read detailed analyses of the “rape scene” on all the major blogs. And yet the scene (which in my opinion only vaguely resembles rape) didn’t interest me.
After all, Girls has desensitized me to watching terrible sex. In the events leading up to the rape scene, Natalia shrugs when her recovering alcoholic boyfriend—whom her alcoholic mother met at AA—orders a Jack & ginger, and the couple go on to order several more. I couldn’t believe this lead-up to the “rape scene,” so I didn’t really buy the characters or their behavior.
On the flip side, one of the best moments in the series was Hannah’s phone message to free-spirit-Jessa in the final episode. It is revealed to us that Hannah idolizes the biggest phony of the four girls, which is interesting, childish and completely realistic. The juxtaposition of the “rape” and the phone call did make me wonder: what is Girls really about?
The first line of Hannah’s ebook may present the show’s thesis: “A friendship between college girls is grander and more dramatic than any romance.” But is Girls really about relationships between girls? They hardly appear in scenes together anymore, and the characters’ arcs are completely dependent on (dramatically) getting together or splitting up with boyfriends.
Enlighteningly, the ratings reveal that girls don’t even watch Girls—fifty-something men watch HBO. It seems that above all else, Girls is “about” whatever Dunham and her producing team want it to be about that week, and the result is more of a Twitter feed than an e-novel. That’s not necessarily a bad thing (and to get meta, it better reflects young life), but I wonder if this is really how the show has been sold.
Despite the fact that the stakes have suddenly risen to a fever pitch in the final episodes of season two, I find myself increasingly ambivalent—about the substance of the show, about the characters and about whether or not I will watch each week: my interest has flatlined.
That this season ends with the reunion of Hannah and Adam in a poignant hug may indicate that season three will delve deeper into the characters’ inner lives, and that the series may be an e-novel after all. Who knows? The only sure thing about Girls is that there are no sure things about Girls. Dunham seems to delight in the surprise twist, if at the expense of authenticity or even nailing the punch line. True to form, what we can probably expect in season three is more sex, more boys, and more anxiety about sex and boys.

Growing tired of the lazy, pot-smoking, man-child protagonist in American comedies? Then perhaps it’s time to give the lazy, unreliable, man-child protagonist in Canadian comedies a go. There’s a chance it’s been done better.
Cheaper by the dozen · David Wozniak (Patrick Huard), a prolific sperm donor, finds joy when he begins to take a role in the lives of some of the children that he has indirectly fathered.  – Courtesy of Entertainment One Films US
Starbuck, the acclaimed French-Canadian comedy that debuted in 2011, is now being shown in limited release in the United States, including in Los Angeles for the first time.
The film centers on a 42-year-old named David Wozniak (Patrick Huard), who is better known by his local sperm bank under the alias of “Starbuck” — he has, after all, donated his sperm there nearly 700 times. David has never given these donations much thought until the day a lawyer shows up and tells him that the clinic made a slight error: It turns out David’s sperm was accidently used exclusively at the clinic for an entire year.
This means that, almost unbelievably, he has fathered a total of 533 children. The real kicker? One-hundred and forty-two of them have now filed a class-action lawsuit against the clinic in an effort to find their biological father’s true identity.
On first glance, David is your classic screw-up. What makes this film stand out is that there is more to him — and more to this film — than some 40-something goofball trying to figure his life out.
The wonderfully talented Huard gives life to David, who works (when he feels like it) as the deliveryman at his father’s butcher shop. At the start of the film, David also owes $80,000 to questionable lenders while his girlfriend, Valerie (Julie Le Breton) is pregnant and questioning David’s reliability to raise a family with her.
Huard manages to bring a certain lovable quality to the role that serves to ground the outlandish story. His charm takes the film, which is being marketed as a comedy, to a gentler level. Though there are definite laugh-out-loud moments, the scenes that one walks away fondly remembering are the ones that hit that soft spot of the heart.
When David is given a folder stacked with the 142 profiles of the offspring who are now suing him, he is at first hesitant to peek inside, but eventually his curiosity prevails. One by one, he blindly picks from the folder to reveal the identities of a number of the human beings he selfishly helped to create.
Throwing himself into a dizzying crash course of parenting, David tracks down a number of his children — sometimes even barging in on what might be the most important days of their lives.
He learns that he has fathered a star professional soccer player, a struggling actor, a lonely drug addict, an unemployed musician and a disabled son, among many others. He forms relationships with some of them, appointing himself as their guardian angel, but is careful not to reveal himself as their father.
The film oozes with bittersweet narratives like that, and Huard shines in his role, masterfully steering the film toward sentimental, but not sappy, moments.
When David is led to one of the meetings meant to organize the case against him, he finds himself surrounded by a room full of his own children. Handling that scene required just the right touch of sentiment and Huard is spot-on as he portrays a character racked with guilt, questioning whether or not he should go through with the countersuit to protect his identity  at all.
Still, the film is a comedy and before it gets too heavy, David’s goofy best friend, Avocat (Antoine Bertrand), steps in as his lawyer and provides much of the film’s comedic relief. Though the film is in French with English subtitles, Bertrand’s pitch-perfect comedic timing comes through well and keeps the story rolling smoothly.
At the time of its original release in 2011, Starbuck was a huge success, winning a number of awards internationally and locally. Aided by exceptional writing, superb performances and thoughtful direction, the film has been embraced as a refreshing take on the popular man-child narrative.
DreamWorks Animation has already jumped on the rights for an upcoming American remake. Set to release in fall 2013, the American version, titled The Delivery Man, will star Vince Vaughn, Cobie Smoulders and Chris Pratt.
Seeing as it will be directed by Ken Scott, the skillful director/co-writer of Starbuck, the odds are it will most likely prove to be just as fertile as the original.
But until then, the French-Canadian Starbuck is more than able to provide a feel-good comedy option for English-speakers.
 
Starbuck is playing in limited release at the Landmark Theatre and will also be released in select theaters in Pasadena, Encino and Orange County on March 29.

Major news outlets have gone all-out on reporting on the Proposition 8 hearing in the Supreme Court this week, but though making marriage legal for all Americans is important and necessary for the betterment of our democracy, there are many under-reported issues facing the LGBTQ community that the media should pick up.
Yes, the ability for same-sex couples to marry and adopt children is important for the legal status and day-to-day life of many queer Americans. But problems such as discrimination, homelessness, poverty, abuse and mental health issues are still much more common for LGBTQ-identified people than many believe.
For one, discrimination against LGBTQ people of color is also much worse than against white LGBTQ people. A 2010 reports found 70 percent of anti-LGBTQ murders are committed against people of color.
Transgender people, who will only be affected by the Prop 8 case if they also identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual, also face significant discrimination. A recent survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality found that 63 percent of transgender Americans had either lost their jobs, were evicted, faced bullying that caused them to drop out of school or faced physical or sexual assault, were homeless, were denied medical service or were incarcerated because of their gender identity or expression.
Nearly a quarter of transgender Americans have had four of the previous incidents happen.
About 20 percent of homeless youth are LGBT, even though the general youth population is about 10 percent LGBT-identified, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless. If homeless, LGBT youth are more than seven times more likely to experience acts of sexual violence than heterosexual cisgender homeless youth. These LGBT youth are also about twice as likely to commit suicide than their heterosexual cisgender counterparts.
Most news outlets aren’t covering these in coordination with the Supreme Court hearings. The legal issues and historical context surrounding same-sex marriage are enough to fill airtime, but there are other issues that can be brought into the national consciousness when the LGBTQ community is in the news.
All types of minorities are affected by this sort of single-issue coverage but, while the push for same-sex marriage has been important in the LGBTQ community in recent years, such tunnel-vision focus can marginalize the T and Q members of the LGBTQ community in particular.
As one USC student, Dylan, a junior majoring in gender studies, put it: “They’re not glamorous and they’re not relevant to affluent — or white — cisgender LGB people, and it’s frustrating.”
The Supreme Court is expected to make its ruling on Prop 8 in June, and whatever the justices decide is certainly important. Some of the media‘s coverage has had a strange effect, however — a 2011 Gallup poll found that U.S. adults, on average, think about 25 percent of Americans are gay or lesbian.
In reality, a Gallup poll from October of 2012 stated that 3.4 percent of Americans identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, which means the decision will affect a fairly small minority of Americans. But it’s a minority that faces far more issues than apparent at first glance — ones that are less hot-button and more endemic, and need to enter the national dialogue now more than ever.
 
Rachel Bracker is a junior majoring in linguistics. She is also a managing editor of the  Daily Trojan.
Of course the contention that the Constitution guarantees persons a right.to marry in accordance with their sexual orientation  raises questions about the nature of sexual orientation and the impact of such a ruling not only upon who may marry whom but whether laws that discriminate by definition will be invalidated by courts. Surely, a bi-sexual will next claim the right.to marry at least one man AND one woman.

A survey released Monday revealed a dismally low approval rating for the Supreme Court among the American public. The survey, released by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, came just days before the Supreme Court was set to begin hearing two highly anticipated cases regarding gay marriage.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
Though some might view the results of the survey in a negative light, it is actually a sign that the Court is carrying out its original duty to make decisions based on legal reasoning — without concern for public opinion.
According to the survey, only 52 percent of Americans approve of the highest court in the nation, while 31 percent disapprove. The current approval rating marks a mere 1 percent increase since last July, when the lowest approval rating since 1985 was recorded.
Instead of signifying the collapse of the Supreme Court’s legitimacy, these low numbers should provide hope that there is a healthy separation between the judiciary and the more political branches of government. After all, anyone who paid attention in 5th grade social studies could tell you that the judiciary was meant to protect the nation from unchecked government power.
Partisan grumbling over what is supposed to be an inherently nonpartisan institution is normal and could perhaps even be seen as a positive. If all Republicans were happy with the decisions of conservative-leaning justices, such as Chief Justice John Roberts, and Democrats with the decisions of more left-leaning justices, such as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, it would indicate a dilution of the impartiality of the law by the justices’ personal politics.
According to the same survey, though, this is not currently the case. About the same percentage of conservative Republicans consider the Court to be liberal as liberal Democrats consider the Court to be conservative (45 and 48 percent, respectively).
In the political realm, the idea of an “activist court” is disparaged as a threat to the very institution of the judiciary. Former Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich drew a lot of attention in the last election cycle for his pledge to reign in misguided judicial decisions, for example. Gingrich controversially proposed a policy of judicial review that would allow Congress not only to subpoena individual judges but also to eliminate whole courts if they made certain decisions considered unfavorable.
Such a proposal was problematic in its implications for the separation of powers doctrine that functions to protect the American government from such capricious action. The point of the courts is not subjectivity, and any interference from other branches based in political ideology would be corrosive to the buffer that the courts provide. Clearly partisan decisions within the judiciary could deliver a deathblow to the institution if allowed to occur unchecked.
Thus, the recently reported approval ratings suggest that such partisan decisions are not currently a significant problem. The evident confusion among the public as to which way the current Supreme Court actually leans also suggests this. The only consistency that court observers should be able to see when it comes to judicial decisions is in legal reasoning, not political opinion.
The purpose of lifetime appointments for justices is that they will not face the crippling pressure of re-election. In other words, they are free to do their work without worrying whether what they decide will negatively impact them maintaining their position. They have no constituents to impress and no votes to lose.
As the Court hears oral arguments this week on cases regarding gay marriage, it is important to remember that justices’ jobs are not to be political figureheads, but to impartially apply the law to current situations.
The Supreme Court is far from flawless, and it would be unreasonable to think that its justices are completely unbiased and that their thinking is not influenced by their political affiliations. But though it is imperfect, the Supreme Court should be lauded for its recent tendency to blur the political lines and defy expectations when it comes to its decision-making.

A USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll found that 72 percent of California voters were in favor of changing the immigration system to include a path to citizenship, while 21 percent were opposed to such a policy.
The USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll, conducted March 11-17, offered insight into three pertinent issues regarding education, gun control and immigration. The full sample included 1,501 registered California voters, and the poll results had a 2.9 percent margin of error. The poll was conducted with Republican polling firm American Viewpoint and Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research.
In a video posted on the poll’s website, Dan Schnur, the poll’s director, said that despite disagreements between Congressional Republicans and Democrats, voters seek change to current immigration policies.
“Many Congressional Republicans are opposed to a path to citizenship,” said Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. “Many Congressional Democrats are leery of enhanced order security and a guest-worker program. But California voters understand that each of these elements is essential to a comprehensive immigration reform package.”
Voter response to the poll shows that Californians are committed to fixing the immigration system, American Viewpoint polling firm representative Dave Kanevsky said during a conference call on Monday.
“There is a consensus that the current immigration system is broken, which is why voters are willing to make major reforms and not just tinker around the edges,” Kanevsky said.
The poll also showed overwhelming support for stricter gun control laws.
Seema Mehta, a political reporter for the L.A. Times, suggested that increased support for California gun control laws stems from a smaller number of individuals owning guns. Four out of five voters support a hypothetical requirement that would enforce background checks on individuals purchasing firearms.
Schnur told CBS News that though a federal assault weapons ban might be difficult to pass, such a ban would easily pass in California.
“Right down the line, Californians have made it clear how strongly they support the idea of gun control,” Schnur said.
The poll also collected public opinion on tax increases in California.
According to the poll, when voters were asked if money should go from wealthier schools to more disadvantaged schools, results were divided. Though 67 percent of Latinos backed the proposal, only 42 percent of white voters did.
Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research’s Drew Lieberman told the L.A. Times that the results suggest that California Governor Jerry Brown will have to defend Proposition 30’s reallocation of extra funds to disadvantaged students. Prop. 30, an initiative that passed on November’s ballot, raised revenue by increasing income taxes on the wealthy and temporarily increasing California’s sales tax from 7.25 to 7.5 percent.
“The challenge for the governor here is to make a case that this is not a divisive issue but a rising-tide-lifts-all-boats proposal,” Lieberman said.
Kanevsky told the L.A. Times that he described such extra funding as “class warfare applied to schools,” as it promotes “taking from one and giving to another.”

Let’s take guns & ammunition away from our parents, homes near wildlife,
& those protecting their families. Why should they be able to protect
themselves? These Right Wingers need to yield to the weeds of the world
who are taking over everywhere …gangs, rapists, burglars, terrorists, etc.
Use your common sense & figure this out you pathetic academic !
Do editors or reporters even look into a story before they print it these days? 
This ‘poll’ was done using hand selected demographics and biased (leading) questions. A single read over the methodology would tell you that. 
These ‘leading polls’ are designed not to inform, but to convince. They attempt to add another ‘fact’ to the side that sponsored them. 
Rather than being trumpeted, they should be ignored as the ‘junk’ science they are.

Students with a meal plan can find  out where to eat their next meal on-campus and what will be served with a few taps on their smartphone.
Fitz Tepper, a freshman majoring in business administration, created the Eat at USC app, which lists all of the locations to eat on campus, including each venue’s location and some items on its menu. The app was launched earlier this month.
Tepper was the application came out of his necessity for finding food on-campus.
“It really kind of started as something that I needed,” Tepper said. “It was a way of solving my own problem.”
Since its launch, the app has been downloaded more than 350 times, Tepper said. Though information about where food venues are and what they serve each day was already available on the USC Hospitality website, even USC Hospitality agrees that the information is not convenient for students on the go.
USC Hospitality associate director of special events, sales & marketing Erika Chesley said seeing Tepper’s application came as a surprise to USC Hospitality because it was already planning to develop its own application for USC venues.
“It actually was, in a way, kind of comical because, coincidentally, we were going to name our application ‘Eat at USC,’” Chesley said.
Chesley, who downloaded the app on her iPhone, said she appreciates Tepper’s work on the application.
“We’re actually really grateful for him for having done this because it just proves our point, which is that it’s the road we want to go down,” Chesley said. “He did a great job with the information that is there and he was very accurate.”
Chesley said USC Hospitality will continue the development of their own application as part of their multiphased project to incorporate technology. The department hopes to introduce the application to incoming freshmen at summer orientation.
Students have responded favorably to the new application. Nicholas Stillman, a freshman majoring in international relations global business, said the application is especially helpful for accessing dining hall menus.
“It’s extremely user-friendly,” Stillman said. “As a freshman, I think the menus for the dining halls are great. I check the menu every single day.”
Chesley echoed Rolwes’ sentiments, saying that she looks forward to making USC Hospitality’s information more easily accessible.
“We all live by our phones these days,” Chesley said. “So it just makes sense to have an application where the information will be readily available to our students, staff, faculty and also to visitors of the university.”

Memorial services were planned this week in honor of the recent deaths of juniors Xinhai Huang and Samuel Levine.
The memorial service for Levine was held Monday night at 10 p.m. at the Sigma Chi fraternity house, where the brothers of Sigma Chi held a candlelight vigil in Levine’s honor.
In memoriam · About 300 students gathered Monday at the Sigma Chi Fraternity on The Row to honor Sam Levine, a junior who died in Mexico. — Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The memorial service for Huang will take place today at 5 p.m. in Room 450 of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Huang, a 22-year-old junior majoring in electrical engineering, died March 18 in a two-car collision about five miles southwest of the University Park Campus.
Viterbi School of Engineering Dean Yannis Yortsos said Huang’s death was tragic for both his family and the Trojan Family.
“We grieve for a promising life cut short, and for his parents who have lost their son,” Yortsos said in a statement.
Levine, a 22-year-old senior majoring in psychology and a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, died March 19 while on vacation in Cabo San Lucas, according to a statement released by Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Dean Steve Kay.
“Sam touched so many of us here at USC with his talents and ambition,” Kay said in the statement. “We all grieve for his incredibly promising life that was tragically cut short.”
Both statements urged students, staff and faculty seeking support to contact Student Counseling Services or the Center for Work and Family Life.
Students who would like to schedule an appointment for grief counseling can make an appointment by calling Student Counseling Services at (213) 740-7711 or the Center for Work and Family Life at (213) 821-0800 during business hours.

Fifteen states, including Texas and Florida, have put rules on the books banning political contributions while their state legislatures are in session. Now, Dan Schnur, director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, is looking to add California’s name to the list.
“I have put together a proposal that would ban all legislative fundraising and all fundraising for statewide officeholders at any time that the Legislature is in session,” said Schnur, a former chair of the California Fair Political Practices Commission.
Currently, California bans contributions from lobbyists during the legislative session but does not ban other fundraising. Though Schnur said this rule means well, it does not prevent other contributors from writing a check during the session.
“Under the current system, the majority of legislators can attend fundraisers at breakfast, lunch and dinner every day they are in Sacramento,” he said.
Schnur’s proposal would limit all contributions during the legislative session, a regulation Schnur says is necessary to weaken the link between political giving and government activity.
“Like it or not, fundraising is a legitimate political activity,” Schnur said. “But, legislating is a legitimate political activity, too. And they shouldn’t be done simultaneously.”
Schnur said the ban could produce several positive outcomes, such as increasing bipartisanship, reducing the appearance of impropriety and curbing the purchase of access during key votes.
“A check that’s written six months before a legislative vote is not going to offer nearly as strong a quid pro quo as that same check written 15 minutes before that same vote,” he said.
California legislative sessions typically run from early January to the end of August, with spring and summer breaks and two short sessions in September and December. But, because legislative sessions can conceivably be any length, Schnur said the proposed ban would stay in effect for 72 hours after the legislative session ended.
“That way they can’t go out of session at 4 o’clock, hold a fundraising dinner and come back in at 7 [p.m.],” Schnur said. “Or what they do in Illinois — and this is especially appalling — Monday is fundraising day in Springfield and then Tuesday through Friday they legislate.”
The ban might also result in more contributions to politicians on the basis of ideology and philosophy, rather than to influence a particular bill, according to Schnur.
For Schnur, tackling campaign fundraising is the next logical step in reforming the state’s political system. He said adding a ban would strengthen two recent political reforms — the top-two primary and redistricting reform — by allowing for more bipartisanship to take place in Sacramento.
“They combine to create an environment where those legislators who are so inclined will have a safe space from which to work with members of the other party,” Schnur said.
A longtime Republican consultant, Schnur changed his party identification from Republican to “decline to state” in March 2011 to allow him to better campaign for political reform.
“This was not a matter of repudiating either political party. It was simply a matter of recognizing that in order to be an effective and credible reform advocate. It couldn’t be done from either major party,” said Schnur, who believes the ban would affect both parties equally.
Schnur plans to move forward with the ban by first reaching out to legislators, a group that Schnur recognizes might be reluctant to throw its weight behind such a proposal.
“As is the case with any political reform, by definition, anyone who has succeeded under the current rules is probably not going to be all that excited about seeing them changed,” he said.
Schnur also plans to reach out to those seeking statewide office and encourage them to include the ban in their platforms. If all else fails, Schnur said a ballot initiative would be an option.
Though there has yet to be polling to measure public opinion on the proposal, Schnur said he believes voters will be on his side.
“While I’m not a soothsayer, I’d be willing to bet if you asked voters if they thought their elected representatives should have to forgo fundraising until their legislative responsibilities are completed each year, you’d probably get a pretty strong ‘yes’ vote,” he said.
Schnur is also currently in the process of working to organize a series of conferences on political reform, including the fundraising ban proposal, at colleges throughout the state.
