The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team swept No. 8 Long Beach State 3-0 (30-28, 31-29, 30-23) last night in the team’s first game at the Galen Center this year.
Junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy led the Trojans with 20 kills, and it was his play at the end of the second game that made sure USC didn’t let Long Beach into the match.
With USC up one game and leading 25-24 in the second game, Troy and Long Beach senior middle blocker Dan Alexander went on a tear that saw the two opposing stars score eight of the last 10 points.
After Alexander got a kill and then Long Beach blocked Troy to give the 49ers game point at 29-28, Troy put the Trojans on his back and killed the next three points to give USC the crucial second game.
“I was just screaming for the ball and luckily [junior setter Riley McKibbin] gave it to me,” Troy said. “I got blocked at                          29-28 and I definitely was not happy about that, so I wanted to get it right. We put them away in game one but we couldn’t let them back in the match. We had to win that second game.”
After saving game point and taking a two-game lead, USC came out fired up in the third game to keep the feisty 49ers at bay.
“After the second set, I think our guys were pretty motivated and focused,” coach Bill Ferguson said. “There was a lot of talk on the bench to go out there and try and put these guys away, and I thought they did a nice job.”
Long Beach wasn’t ready to concede the match yet. But with the score tied 8-8, USC broke the game open with a 16-5 run, and the 49ers never got closer than five the rest of the game.
“When you’re up two games we know how easy it is to relax, so we just stepped on the pedal right there,” junior outside hitter Tri Bourne said. “One of our goals is to sweep a lot of teams this year, so that’s what we went for tonight.”
Bourne set the tone early for the Trojans, recording six kills in the opening game as the 49ers focused on stopping Troy and junior middle blocker Austin Zahn.
Bourne’s domination in the first game caused the 49ers to adjust and that opened up the floor for Troy later in the match.
“Tri had a great game, and he’s a great player,” Troy said. “With the lineup we have and the weapons we have a lot of teams are going to try to make Tri beat them and that’s what Long Beach started to do tonight and Tri beat them. Then, they realized they had to be more balanced, and that’s when we spread the ball around and became more successful.”
Bourne’s quick start helped the Trojans establish an early lead, something that’s been a weak point all season. And unlike  Friday’s game against UC Irvine, the Trojans came out firing from the start. They built a four point lead early and kept that margin until Long Beach came back late thanks to some heavy kills by Alexander.
With Alexander leading the way, the 49ers came within one point multiple times late in the first game, but some timely kills by Bourne and Troy ensured USC got the first game victory it wanted.
“We focused on that a lot in practice,” Bourne said. “We know we came out soft in some games and like coach said, he wants us to take the first punch, so that’s what we went out and did.”

After competing in tournaments down the coastline last weekend, the USC women’s tennis team will begin competition today, hosting their first dual match of the year.
The No. 9 nationally ranked Women of Troy will challenge the No. 50 Long Beach State 49ers today at Marks Stadium at 1:30 p.m. Last year, USC beat Long Beach State 7-0 during the spring season and is hoping to repeat that success.
Leader · Junior Maria Sanchez is ranked No. 8 headed into the season. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
The seven-time defending Big West champion 49ers, however, also hold an impressive roster. Sophomore Rachel Manasse and freshman Jaklin Alawi made their debut in the doubles rankings at No. 58. The duo had a perfect 4-0 record in fall play, and won the Fullerton Invitational doubles championship.
But the Women of Troy are also coming out of a successful fall season. Eight players returned from the 2009 roster, which went undefeated in the Pac-10, claiming their first-ever conference crown and a 21-3 overall record.
Junior Maria Sanchez leads the way after pounding out a dominant fall season for the Trojans, holding a No. 8 singles ranking. Sanchez and the Women of Troy are looking for a fast start to their season.
“We are all just getting eager to start the season,” Sanchez said.
Sophomore Alison Ramos, who holds a No. 39 ranking in singles, echoed Sanchez’s anticipation for the dual season to begin.
“We’re just ready to compete,” Ramos said.
Two other Women of Troy have secured 2010 singles rankings, with freshmen Danielle Lao and Valeria Pulido weighing in a No. 18 and No. 37.
In the doubles scene, Sanchez and Pulido are teamed up with a No. 19 national rank.
The lineup for the match includes six singles matches and three doubles matches. The lineup is not yet official, but for singles play, it is expected to be Sanchez, senior Sarah Fansler, Ramos, Lao, Pulido and junior Leyla Entekhabi.
For doubles play, the lineup is expected to be Sanchez and junior Lyndsay Kinstler, Pulido and Fansler, and Ramos and Lao.
Each win for a singles match earns the team one team point, while the team that wins two out of three doubles matches gets a doubles point.
The teams will be notified this morning if the match is still on, depending on weather conditions. If there is bad weather, the match will be rescheduled for a later date. USC will also host UC Irvine on Friday at 1:30 p.m. at Marks Stadium.

Lane Kiffin’s continued to fill his coaching staff Wednesday as he hired James Cregg to be the new offensive line coach for the Trojans.
Cregg, who held the same position under Kiffin in Tennessee, joins a large contingent of crossover coaches from the Knoxville team to USC’s staff.
After Kiffin was hired to be the new coach of the Trojans, he announced he would be bringing along assistants Ed Orgeron and Monte Kiffin. Wednesday’s announcement only continued Kiffin’s trend of hiring people he trusts.
Cregg’s involvement with Kiffin goes even farther back than his one year at Tennessee. Cregg was an assistant coach to Kiffin for the NFL’s Oakland Raiders. He worked with Kiffin for the extent of the coach’s year and a half tenure with the team.
After Kiffin was let go by the Raiders, Cregg stayed on staff for interim coach Tom Cable.
Cragg worked with Cable for eight games, during which time the Raiders had limited success.
With two games remaining in the Raiders season, Cregg bolted to join Kiffin at Tennessee just two weeks after it was announced that Kiffin would be the coach for the Volunteers.
Kiffin and Cregg also had a working relationship prior to their time at premier football coaching jobs,
In 1999, Kiffin worked for one season at Colorado State as the offensive line coach for the Rams, while Cregg was on staff as a graduate assistant that year.
Cregg is a native of northern California and played high school football at Norco High School in Norco, Calif. Cregg was elected into the Norco High School Hall of Fame in 2001.
After high school, Cregg played for Colorado State as an offensive lineman, starting during both his junior and senior year.
During his junior year, Cregg helped lead the Rams to the Western Athletic Conference title and participated in the Holiday Bowl in his final two years.
In his senior year, Cregg was included in the WAC’s all-conference team as an offensive lineman.
After his playing time, Cregg stayed on staff at Colorado State for three years as a graduate assistant. During his time at his alma mater, the Rams won two conference championships and captured another Holiday Bowl victory in 1997.
He then moved on to coach the defensive line for Colgate University from 2000-2003, where he helped the Raiders make it all the way to the NCAA I-AA (now Football Championship Subdivision) championship game.
Cregg then held the same position at Idaho from 2004-2006 before joining Kiffin with the Raiders.

After a thrilling victory against crosstown rival UCLA on Jan. 17 at the Galen Center, the Women of Troy hope to carry that momentum into Washington starting tonight.
Involvement · Senior guard Hailey Dunham is part of a balanced attack that has helped the Women of Troy to a 4-1 record in the Pac-10. -  Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“We’re definitely feeling good about ourselves and I think we’ve won some games that were really difficult,” coach Michael Cooper said.
The Women of Troy are currently sitting in second place in the Pac-10 with a 4-1 record in conference play, but are looking to solidify their position in the standings tomorrow against the Washington Huskies.
The Huskies (8-8, 3-3) return four starters from last year, but the Women of Troy have won their last three meetings.
Traveling to Washington will not be an easy task though.
Sophomore guard Ashley Corral, a Washington native, said she is “really excited” to be going home and playing in front of her hometown but understands the gravity of the situation.
“[Washington] is tough to beat at home, so we need to come out and take care of business,” Corral said.
The upcoming road trip will be an important test for the Women of Troy, especially on the defensive side of the ball.
“Going to Washington is definitely important, but we have to take it one game at a time,” Cooper said. “We have to get it done from a defensive standpoint, because defense can win you games on the road.”
The Women of Troy have been led by Corral and sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath but have also received steady and solid contributions from the rest of the supporting cast.
Senior guard Heather Oliver has been shooting the ball well this season, providing the Women of Troy an outside threat to complement the inside games of senior guard/forward Aarika Hughes and junior center Kari LaPlante.
But the Women of Troy will need a team effort tomorrow night if they want to stay in contention for a Pac-10 conference championship.
“These games are very important. Corral said. We’ve played the top four ranked preseason teams in the Pac-10 and beat them.  All of that work that we put in goes to waste if we don’t win these two games.”
The upcoming road trip may prove to be a challenge, but the team has a positive attitude about its recent play and the effect its recent success will have on the upcoming road trip.
“We’re playing with a lot of confidence and we know that we’re good, and I think that will carry over,” Corral said.
Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m.

Seldom are there opportunities for do-overs in sports.
But I would bet that USC wishes it had another chance to recruit Klay Thompson.
Thompson now stars as a guard for Washington State, an off-the-map destination for what might be one of the Pac-10’s best players. The sweet-shooting sophomore has emerged as one of the country’s most potent threats, ranking fifth in the NCAA in points per game.
USC will have to find a way to contain Thompson tonight when the Trojans play Washington State at the Galen Center, but few teams have had luck corralling him. And as Trojan defenders prepare to lock him down, they’ll also have to consider that they could have been playing alongside him.
Thompson’s emergence as a star seemed unlikely just a few years ago when he was playing in USC’s backyard. Throughout his career at Santa Margarita Catholic High School, Thompson was always known for having a great shooting stroke. But questions persisted about how his skills would translate at the next level, even after a standout senior season.
Despite having offers from several schools, Thompson was essentially ignored by the Pac-10. Yet Washington State, which under former coach Tony Bennett developed a reputation for overachieving with lightly recruited players, seemed like the perfect fit for the second-generation basketball star (Thompson’s father is Mychal Thompson, the No. 1 overall pick in the 1978 NBA Draft).
Less than two years later, Thompson has made plenty of schools regret overlooking him — including USC.
“It would have been cool to go to USC or UCLA at the time, but they already had guys recruited at my position, so it was difficult to get an offer from either of the two. I understood the situation,” Thompson told Sports Illustrated this summer.
The Trojans looked at Thompson but already had a commitment from Malik Story, a player who began his career as a highly touted prospect but fizzled after a tumultuous senior year. Story never enrolled at USC, instead starting at Indiana and then transferring to Nevada.
Former USC coach Tim Floyd tried to explain last year why Thompson slipped through his fingers in favor of a player that never made it to campus. But hey, it’s not his problem anymore.
Still, Thompson’s story reveals plenty about the previous administration of Trojan basketball.
Floyd had an odd habit of reaching for stars and burning up in the atmosphere when he fell short. He was able to bring in NBA-level talent, but it often created great roster turnover that forced the team to plug leaks on a yearly basis.
The influx of stars often came at the expense of players like Thompson who are capable of overachieving. Floyd also often ignored positional needs, instead bringing in a glut of swingmen no matter the team’s landscape.
It’s true that elite talent often separates the top-tier teams from the rest in the NCAA. And Floyd deserves credit for bringing in the current players as well as assembling what would have been a stellar recruiting class.
But it was Floyd’s pairing with O.J. Mayo and whatever happened subsequently that got USC in hot water with the NCAA. And it wasn’t until this year that, without a star on the team, many of the former role players started to flourish.
There should always be room for players like Klay Thompson ­— more coaches just need to realize it.
USC’s handling of Thompson also brings into question a NCAA-wide practice: recruiting too early. Surely there was a time when Story looked like a better prospect than Thompson, but there’s little value in making prognostications on players who are still growing.
Story committed to USC before his sophomore season, but Floyd took commitments from players so young that they hardly knew where their high school locker was. Plenty of schools race to lock down players as early as possible, but the pledges rarely tend to pan out. Since when are 14-year-olds capable of committing to after-school plans, let alone a college?
Schools have to begin making inroads with prospects as early as possible — it’s a reality of the recruiting game. But schools should be aware that their evaluations need to continue into the later years of high school. Some players plateau and others, like Thompson, are late bloomers but show great potential.
Perhaps it would have taken a circuitous route for Floyd to get Thompson to USC. But there’s no question how much the Trojans could use him — Thompson has made 44 three-pointers this season, which doubles Dwight Lewis’ team-leading total of 22.
There’s nothing USC coach Kevin O’Neill can do about it, but tonight he might wish that USC hadn’t let Thompson be the one that got away.

Transportation Security Administration director nominee Erroll Southers withdrew his name from consideration Wednesday after Republican efforts to block his appointment raised eyebrows around the country.
The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that Southers, the associate director for special programs at USC’s National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events, had decided not to pursue the TSA directorship.
“It is clear that my nomination has become a lightning rod for those who have chosen to push a political agenda at the risk of the safety and security of the American people,” Southers said in a statement, according to the New York Times. “This partisan climate is unacceptable, and I refuse to allow myself to remain part of their dialogue.”
Members of the GOP feared Southers would attempt to unionize the TSA and had suspended the vote on his appointment in early January.
“Americans deserve a leader at TSA with integrity and with an unwavering commitment to putting security ahead of politics,” Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) said in a statement.
Several Republican senators also expressed concern that Southers had run background checks on his then-estranged wife’s ex-boyfriend over 20 years ago as a former FBI agent.
Southers admitted to the incident, and had been censured by the FBI at the time of the occurrence.
The White House accepted his withdrawal, but spokesperson Nick Shapiro expressed how “uniquely qualified” Southers was for the position.
“[Obama] believes that Erroll Southers would have been an excellent TSA administrator but understands his personal decision and the choice he has made,” Shapiro said Wednesday, according to CNN.

The United Kingdom is no stranger to resounding yet haunting indie-rock bands guided by post-punk melancholy and ascending synth lines. Blame it on the sovereign state’s dreary weather or the Manchester club scene of the late 1970s, but the recent U.S. release of Editors’ third studio album, In This Light and On This Evening continues this accented dark indie-rock dalliance.
Cut copy · For their latest release, In This Light and On This Evening, British band Editors enlisted a new producer and new sounds. - Photos courtesy of EPIC Records 
Spawned from the post-punk resurgence of the early 2000s — as was the case in the United Kingdon with Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party and across the pond with New York City-based groups like The Strokes and Interpol — Editors have been the British band du jour since the group’s first two albums, The Back Room and An End Has a Start, yielding top-10 singles and earning platinum recognition for selling more than 2 million copies worldwide.
After these early successes, the band was praised by The Mail on Sunday as the second biggest British band of the decade, after the Arctic Monkeys. And as for all the comparisons to post-punk originators, the band has already produced a progeny in similarly despondent yet musically illuminated fellow Brits, White Lies.
For In This Light and On This Evening, Editors kept it in the British family by recruiting Grammy Award-winning producer Mark “Flood” Ellis, whose previous clients include The Killers, Depeche Mode and U2, and whose musical signature incorporates a heavy use of synthesizers. The band’s members said months before In This Light and On This Evening dropped in the United Kingdom on Oct. 9 that they wanted their third album to have a newer, rawer sound. Although it’s a commendable wish, it strikes fans as a patent unlikelihood for a two-time platinum band that sells out arenas in Europe.
It’d be a stretch to say that Editors accomplished its goal. Ultimately, this incestual collaboration appears to have generally done Editors more harm than good — specifically on In This Light and On This Evening — keeping both the band and its sound strictly within the musical confines of the Union Jack.
From the album’s opening songs, it’s obvious Flood has driven the group down the synthesized road at full speed. “Papillion” pulsates with a racing electronic melody precisely fit for dance-punk halls, while the harmonious, church choir-esque “You Don’t Know Love” delivers a sleek yet generic indie-rock anthem. As one catchy electro-rock hook picks up from where the other left off, it forces the listener to wonder if Editors either strayed too far from the shadowy essence of its previous albums or if the band failed to experiment enough.
In This Light and On This Evening mellows the pacing with “The Boxer,” a dulcet tune that features echoing guitars playing second-string to spiraling synth lines and lead vocalist Tom Smith’s smooth and refined baritone. “The Boxer” is the first moment on the album  where the band’s call for a more stripped-bare timbre is not only apparent but valid and incredibly appealing.
The same grittiness can also be found on the jarring synth ballad “The Big Exit,” where Smith pulls off an eerie Ian Curtis impersonation as he belts lovelorn lyrics that would make any Curtis worshipper proud. It is then, with Smith’s voice backed by a pounding drum beat and maddening screeching that sounds like a metal chair being forcefully scraped against a linoleum floor, that Editors come into its own — though perhaps a bit too late into the album.
The album is cohesive overall but, although the brooding vibe is there, the sound is not. While Ian Curtis-led Joy Division’s music felt spacious with its instrumentation minimal yet sonically vast, In This Light and On This Evening feels compressed and claustrophobic as the use of synthesizers suffocates the listener in its overproduction.
It would be daunting for any band to live up and strive to exceed expectations with an endless barrage of Joy Division and Echo and the Bunnyman raining down on it, but Editors should take a hint from its predecessors and make an effort to trim the synth fat. Sometimes, a bit of editing goes a long way.

While the football team’s recent losses certainly have damaged the program, the women’s golf team is set to suffer a similar blow at the end of the season.
Sophomore Jennifer Song, the No. 1 collegiate golfer in the country according to the Golfweek/Sagarin rankings, has announced that she will become a professional at the end of the season.
Song, who has won both of the tournaments she has played for the Women of Troy this season, is planning to turn pro in time to participate in the Women’s US Open.
Her freshman season with the Women of Troy culminated in a second place finish at the NCAA Championship, being named a first team All American and winning the NCGA’s Freshman of the Year award.
In between these seasons, Song became the second woman to ever win the Women’s Public Links championship and the Women’s Amateur in the same year.  She went on to finish 13th at the US Women’s Open, the lowest finish by any amateur in the field.
Song made the decision to turn pro after competing in the Halan-Kolon LPGA Tournament in Seoul, South Korea, last October.  She broke the news to her teammates at their annual Christmas party.
She has announced that she will retain her amateur status through this year’s Curtis Cup, a team competition between the top female amateurs in the United States and Great Britain/Ireland.  The NCAA Championship tournament is May 18-21 this year, giving Song and her teammates another opportunity to win the national title that eluded them last season.

My name is Nicholas Slayton, and I was a spoiler addict.
No matter how hard we try to wait for the endings and plot thickeners of our favorite movies, books and shows, spoilers abound. The largest source of these are the Internet, where everything from the twists to the season finale of 24 to the death of a beloved literary character are just a click away. 
My addiction to spoilers began in the summer of 2007 with two moments that drove me into an information-seeking frenzy. The first was seeing the teaser trailer for The Dark Knight in theaters. The second was catching up on Christopher Nolan’s entire filmography. I was hooked on Nolan’s work, and I wanted more. At that moment, I had to find out everything I could about The Dark Knight.
Within days, I was caught up in the spoiler hunt. I hounded movie news sites for plot summaries and downloaded leaked screenshots. I was hooked on the story before the film even opened. It was only thanks to a distracting — and addictive — alternate reality game and a strong desire not to fully ruin the film-watching experience that I abstained from looking at readily available ending spoilers.
Now, Nolan has a new film coming out, Inception, and this time I have promised myself not to even go near spoilers. But when I forced myself to look away, I asked myself, why are we so obsessed with knowing all the details anyway? Are we really that impatient?
In a word: yes. We are. The 21st century is a “need it now” society and the Internet is the ultimate tool to help us get it now. Everyone has a Blackberry or an iPhone, meaning the Internet is always nearby, and, in a world where Wikipedia entries are updated within minutes of a celebrity death, Twitter feeds give instant updates from friends and up-to-the-minute news is always online, it only makes sense that everyone knows about the latest episode of Lost before it airs.
The Internet is a smorgasbord of information just waiting to be pounced on, and the fact that spoilers abound on the Internet is just another symptom of the web’s information overload. An innocent Google search can reveal surprise-ruining information about movies, television shows, novels and even secret guests at concerts.
And it’s not as if spoilers are an underground trend for a niche market. Websites such as SpoilerFix.com have helped make revealing inside information a popular topic on the web. Even the science fiction blog io9.com features a daily article called “Morning Spoilers,” which compiles pictures, set reports and leaked casting information about the latest movies and television shows.
The worst offenders, however, are social networking sites. As the instantaneous transmitter of entertainment gossip and news, social networking sites carry spoilers to fresh eyes, whether they want it or not. When J.K. Rowling’s book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince came out, people’s online statuses, Twitters and websites collectively declared the instant meme of “Snape kills Dumbledore!”
People love to share stories and trade new information, even at the expense of a surprise ending. And the rapid-fire nature of the Internet allows for it more than ever. There is a sense of instant gratification in spoilers — all the information, with none of the effort of actually experiencing the work.
We are addicted to knowledge, and while there may not be a 12-step program available for those who crave spoilers, it’s not impossible to shut them away. First, resist the urge. Most websites will warn you that they contain spoilers, giving you a chance to leave. Or try aversion therapy. Maybe replace news about movie and T.V. shows with politics or current events. Focusing on the present instead of things far away will help pass the time until you can find out the answers for yourself.
Don’t ruin a good moment just because you can find out about it beforehand. Enjoy the experience of watching the show and having it all revealed to you as it happens. It will be worth it. Why settle for instant, simple gratification when you can get the full experience with a little patience?
Inception comes out in July. And while there are many sites out there beckoning to divulge exclusive information to me, I’ve lasted this long without looking at spoilers and — like a sober alcoholic — it’s not worth it to give in now.
It’s going to be a long six months, but I am not ruining this for myself.

At 32 years old, USC School of Cinematic Arts alumnus Brendan Hayward, who graduated in 2004, finally found his first big break. 
His submission to the Doritos “Crash the Superbowl” commercial competition was chosen as one of the top six finalists, winning him $25,000 and bringing him one step closer to his dream of becoming a successful film director — and it all started when he first signed up for an elective film class his senior year of college.
“I really just needed an easy A,” Hayward said. “But I ended up really liking it. It was the first time I saw something that I really want to do.”
Hayward comes from a family with math and science backgrounds; both his parents are engineers and his grandfather, a physicist, helped build the atomic bomb. So when Hayward entered the University of Virginia as a physics major, he seemed destined to follow the same career path as his family. Though he enjoyed his time in Virginia, he never experienced a burning passion for his studies — until he took that fateful film class.
It was then that Hayward found his true calling ­— film production.
“Everyone in my family was into math and science, but I figured out that I was actually really into film,” Hayward said. “I ended up not getting a good grade in the class, but I also figured out what I actually wanted to do with my life.”
After graduation, Hayward cast his physics degree aside and decided to act on his passion. Within a year of graduation, he had packed up his Honda Accord and driven across the country to Los Angeles. Two years later, he got accepted into the Peter Stark Producing Program, a selective two-year graduate program at USC offering intensive preparation for careers in film production.
Even with a prestigious masters degree in hand though, breaking into the film industry is a huge challenge. To make ends meet after leaving USC, Hayward worked at an SAT tutoring company in Santa Monica. A high school tutor by day, dreamer by night, he saved up whatever money he earned so that he could spend it on his independent film projects, eventually hoping to break into commercial directing.
Meanwhile, Hayward started looking for film contests online, hoping for a way to make his name known to the highly competitive world of the film industry. When he found out about the Doritos “Crash the Superbowl” competition, he saw his chance.
“The Doritos [competition] is top of all commercial contests,” Hayward said. “Not only does it offer a lot of money, but you get to be shown during the Superbowl. It doesn’t get any higher than that.”
His winning commercial, called “The Smackout,” is about two men playing a game where they physically smack each other — the first one to flinch has to make the next Doritos run. Beside them, their girlfriends sit and watch in disbelief.
As a big football fan, Hayward found inspiration for his commercial from his fellow football buddies.
“I saw a lot of games that the guys play, and I came up with the idea of two guys smacking each other. It’s just pure physical comedy, and I thought it would work for Doritos, because Doritos is sort of into all that kick-to-the-groin slapsticks,” Hayward said.
But the journey to his current winning commercial was full of setbacks. In fact, Hayward entered the competition last year but lost. Undeterred, he entered again this year but ended up having to reshoot the entire film because he was not satisfied with some of the acting in the original.
Just two days before the submission deadline, Hayward found himself agonizing over whether or not he should reshoot the commercial.
“I asked my girlfriend, ‘Should I spend another $2,000 to reshoot it?’ And she said, ‘Well, will you regret it if you don’t?’”
In the end, Hayward decided that he did not want to have any regrets, so he rewrote and reshot the commercial and submitted both the original and re-do in the nick of time. The second last-minute commercial won.
“It was amazing,” said Hayward about his reaction to the news. “I jumped through the roof. I thought they had already announced the winners, and I thought I had lost. It was two days before Christmas when they called and said, ‘This is Doritos. Do you know why I’m calling?’ And then they told me, and I screamed and called my girlfriend. It was a great early Christmas present.”
This was not the only time Hayward’s girlfriend, Alana Littler,  had contributed to his accomplishments. Littler, a marketing brand expert, she noticed that the first commercial Hayward shot was full of stereotypes and, during the second round, helped him change the scripts to make it more “female-friendly.” The result: women cast as incredulous and amused girlfriends, while still retaining the casual stereotypical view of silly, childish boyfriends.
“My girlfriend has been awesome, helping me through,” Hayward said. “She was an integral part of me getting into the contest. I think the commercial got picked because of the help I got from her.”
She was also the first person he called to celebrate, and they cracked champagne together that night. But they had no time for any other major celebrations as Hayward was already worrying about getting public votes and planning out how to make it to the final round.
For Hayward, the voting process has been just as tough as the shooting process, if not harder. Enlisting all of his friends to help him out, Hayward created Facebook pages, a website and sent out e-mail newsletters to everyone he knows. Hayward learned to build a thick skin by constantly seeking more votes, no matter how annoying he had to be.
And though his parents had at first disapproved of his decision to switch to a film career, they have supported him throughout the competition, helping him to solicit more votes. His girlfriend joined him in interviews on local radio stations, and the two even traveled to Hawaii to gain more voters.
If Hayward makes it to the top three, he could potentially win a grand prize of more than a million dollars. The first thing he said he would do with the money is pay a bonus to everyone who was involved in the project. Then he would donate $10,000 to his high school film program in Cranston, R.I. With the leftover money, Hayward plans to produce yet another film. Eventually, he desires to break away from directing commercials and move into producing romantic comedies.
The voting ends on Jan. 31, but Hayward will find out the results along with every other viewer during the Super Bowl XLIV broadcast on Feb. 7. Doritos will pay for a six-day trip to the game in Miami. The six finalists will watch the game together, and their reactions will be filmed when the winning commercials are aired.
But in the case he doesn’t win, Hayward will still continue to pursue his career goals.
“The way I look at the voting process is that on Jan. 31 when it’s all done and over, if I look back and say, ‘I’ve tried my hardest and done everything I could have done but still didn’t win,’ then I’m fine with it,” Hayward said.
Being one of the top six finalist out of 4,000 entries is already a big success, and Hayward says his future is set: he will no longer have to direct as a side job. Besides, there just might be other perks.
“I’ll have to ask if I can get free Doritos,” Hayward added. “I love Cool Ranch, it’s my favorite flavor.”
This is one sharp young man and he should go far.  He certainly demonstrates the importance of persistance.  Now where have I heard that before?

In just his first year as coach of the USC women’s basketball team, coach Michael Cooper has brought a new energy to the Women of Troy.
However, that energy went a bit too far after last Sunday’s 70-63 victory over rival UCLA.
During the postgame press conference, Cooper’s first words were: “My opening statement is (expletive) UCLA”
Cooper received a great deal of media attention for the surprising statement and offered an apology Tuesday via a letter to Bruins coach Nikki Caldwell.
“I want to offer my sincerest apology to you, your players and your university for the inappropriate comment I made after our game on Sunday,” Cooper stated in his letter. “There is no excuse for it, and I realize it is outside the bounds of good sportsmanship.”
Cooper, who was a popular figure in Los Angeles during his days as a Los Angeles Laker, has never been a controversial figure, and even won the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award in 1986, which awards “outstanding service and dedication to the community.”
Cooper realized his mistake Tuesday, and knew the impact of his comments.
“As a coach, I know I am a role model to student-athletes and my comment was certainly not a proper example for them. I will work hard to correct that,” Cooper said.
Despite Cooper’s apology, Pac-10 officials stated Tuesday that the conference was looking into the comments and situation, and Cooper may be reprimanded by the Pac-10.
He just got a little too much into the Trojan fever thing…It’s OK, we appreciate his fervor.
Oh my.  Didn’t his team win the game???

In our society, we are told that if we work hard enough for something, we can achieve it. Who knew that the rich and famous would come to understand this illustrious set of desirables to include rhinoplasty, breast enhancement, liposuction and a laundry list of other cosmetic surgeries only a sliver of America’s upper crust can obtain and actually afford? 
This week, Heidi Montag, the 23-year-old reality star made famous from MTV’s The Hills, sent shock waves to the public and to her fans when she revealed her new look on the cover of People Magazine. The headline read “Addicted to Plastic Surgery,” and rightfully so.
Last November, Montag went under the knife to have more than just a couple cosmetic operations performed, including a nose job revision, Botox injections to her forehead, a mini brow lift, breast and buttocks augmentation, chin reduction and liposuction on her neck, waist and thighs. The self-conscious starlet also had her lips enhanced with collagen and her ears pinned back, bringing the outrageous total to 10 whopping procedures, which all took place over 10 hours in a single day.
ABC news has suggested Montag is using her nips and tucks as another publicity stunt and calculated promotion for her new album. Could this be true? After all, she is one half of the notorious fame-seeking duo, Speidi. Along with her husband Spencer Pratt, Montag trots shamelessly around the streets of Tinseltown self-promoting her career to no end and soaking up the luxuries of being a polarizing entertainment personality. But surgery for fame?
At least she’s creative.
At the sight of Montag in all her plastic glory, a number of questions arise: What is that? What the hell did she do to her face? Perhaps most importantly, what message is she setting for the millions of young fans following her every scripted, televised move? Whichever way you look at it, her message is diluted and irresponsible.
It is definitely no surprise that young people in their teens and twenties, many who idolize the star, most commonly deal with self-image problems; Montag paints herself as a victim no different. A study from the National Institute on Media and the Family reports that by the time girls reach college, nearly 80 percent are unhappy with their body image. As displayed by Montag, there are dangerous alternatives that can be taken to drown out the pressures from the media, the industry and an ever so judgmental public audience.

One route some take is eating disorders. According to The National Institute of Mental Health, about 10 percent of female college students suffer from some kind of eating disorder, most prominently bulimia. The other route is going under the knife. Montag’s promotion of plastic surgery and consequential “obsession with being perfect” offers another drastic coping strategy for young men and women to achieve their ideal state of beauty.
But is Montag just the poster child for a pre-existing trend? Recent studies from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery suggest that young people ages between the ages of 18 and 24 are now more than ever accepting of cosmetic alteration. Last year, hundreds of thousands of these pricey procedures were performed on young people, stunting car sales and making the nose job and breast enhancement the new graduation gifts of choice. Undoubtedly, plastic surgery is no longer centered in Hollywood but is just as popular among the masses.
Whether Montag chooses to accept her position as a role model or not, her actions are amplified with resounding clarity, as she is a figure in the public spotlight. For its decision to put Montag on the cover, People Magazine — a credible, respected entertainment publication known for its ability to distance itself from the trashy tabloid circuit — is now under fire from readers and Hollywood stars alike. Actress and singer Emmy Rossum slammed the magazine saying that Montag on the cover legitimizes “the dangerous lengths to which some will go for fame and beauty.”
Rossum’s concerns are valid, though the public doesn’t help either. The public demands that its stars be beautiful, and Montag defends her surgery as merely a job requirement. However, what the magazine and apparently Montag’s doctors fail to acknowledge are the medical dangers and huge social repercussions that can occur following Montag’s example. At 23, if her addiction is true — though she claims she’s not addicted — the situation could be far more tragic than we know.
With Montag’s philosophy in mind, if we work hard enough, we can achieve whatever we want, as long as we’re flaunting good bone structure, stick-thin waists and an F cup.

I thought Korean females were bad about this?? Korean females are obsessed with plastic surgery, and even get it as a high school graduation gift. They aspire to have “white” i.e. Euro facial features, which they think is the aesthetic standard. Heidi Montag is white, so by default she doesn’t need plastic surgery. She’s beautiful already!

CNN published a story at the beginning of January outlining the possible health advantages of having sexual intercourse. These benefits will soon be revealed in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. And just like a captivated puppy, every college student in the country just perked up one ear. 
The article said that people who have frequent sex will benefit from a healthier heart, lower blood pressure, a lower risk of different types of cancer and a longer lifespan.
It also listed benefits such as relief for migraines and lower back pain, higher testosterone levels, healthier semen for men and fewer negative symptoms for women during menopause. Also, CNN lists sex as an effective form of exercise. In fact, it reported that having sex 12 times burns as many calories as running seven miles.
In light of this article, I decided to see how students and health professionals on campus felt about the new study and how they thought it could affect the overall campus culture. I mean, I was certainly surprised to find out that an act frowned upon in our society for people my age, unless judged under specific circumstances like marriage, is now being seen in a positive and more encouraging light.
According to the USC American College Health Association’s National College Health Assessment Report of 2009, which was based on results collected from a student survey, 23.1 percent of students are exercising at a rate that would help them maintain a healthy body. Healthy students are defined as those that participate in about 30 minutes of semi-intense exercise five to seven times a week.
When asked what types of activities they considered exercise, most students listed sports, gym activities — such as elliptical machines and weights — swimming, running, etc. Not surprisingly, not one student considered sexual intercourse as a form of exercise.
I interviewed students to find out how they thought their peers might react to the findings mentioned in the CNN article. Several respondents agreed that sex, as a form of exercise, would not lead students to a particular view or opinion regarding their personal sexual activity.
“I think sex for a lot of people is also a moral issue, so I don’t think if [the CNN study] was proven, people would go out and have sex gratuitously,” said Sabrina Rahrovi, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
But a few students thought these new study results would encourage others to justify having sex to themselves and to others.

“I think it would [change the college culture] because it would lead to a lot more people having sex,” said Sheliza Kabani, a junior majoring in biochemistry.
The USC report said 35.1 percent of students engaged in vaginal intercourse within 30 days of taking the survey and about 40 percent of those students said they always used a condom.
Yet despite the relatively low rate of students who use condoms as contraception, the rates of sexually transmitted diseases among USC undergraduates are relatively low.
On campus, less than 3 percent of undergraduates have human papillomavirus (HPV), and less than 1 percent of undergrads have chlamydia, gonorrhea or HIV. Further, 85 percent of undergraduates within the last 12 months had either zero or one sexual partners.
I asked several students how the information presented in the CNN article might affect students’ views on conducting safe sex in the future, and several students said it would encourage students to engage in safer sex now more than before.
“I think these findings are shedding light on sex in a positive way, so this positively would add to the idea of safe sex,” Rahrovi said.
Paula Swinford, the director of USC Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Services, said the information in the CNN article would not affect students’ sexual behavior at all.
“It’s trivia that would catch people’s eye,” she said. “But the reasons why we have sex and take care of ourselves while we are having sex are much more complex than just getting a bit of exercise.”
While I’m not convinced that the college culture will change significantly because of the results of CNN’s study, I do think that people in relationships and those who are already having sex with a specific partner will have more incentive to engage in sex on a more regular or frequent basis. But those who are not having sex are not going to start just because a study says it’s good for their health.
Students will still use their moral and personal views to base their readiness for sex, but at least now they can weigh the positives and negatives with enough pros and cons on each side to keep the scale balanced.
Danielle Nisimov is a sophomore majoring in public relations. Her column “On the SCene” runs Thursdays.
This incentivizes me to make good on that new year’s resolution: to lose weight…Now only if I had a partner.
Sex twelve times instead of seven miles of running?  What is considered running?  The faster you go, the more calories you can burn within a span of time and distance.
Think of the time frame as well.  It doesn’t take nearly as long to run a little bit than to have sex twelve times.
man…I need a work out right now…lol!!!

You may be asking yourself: comic books? Seriously? Well, why not? Comic books are the ultimate template for creativity. Movies require millions of dollars, but with comics, you can get intense action, emotive characters and genius stories, all for a cheap cost. Interested now?
If you are, think of this post as a comic book primer, a kind of must-reads to wet your appetite for illustrated stories and provide you with some recommendations for great comics of the past decade. So, what’s the first story on the list? Green Arrow: Year One.
Most people may know Oliver Queen and his alter ego from his appearances on Smallville, where he was basically used as a stand in for the unavailable Batman, but Green Arrow has been a staple of DC Comics since his creation in the 1940s. Originally a Batman copycat with an archery gimmick, the character evolved into a goateed man of the people, defending the impoverished and sticking it to the man. Basically he’s John Lennon meets Robin Hood. Year One, from the creative team of Andy Diggle and Jock, tells the story of how Ollie became a hero, and developed his social conscience.
The heir to his family’s billion dollar corporation, twenty-something playboy Oliver “Ollie” Queen is stuck in his life. Vaguely socially aware, he spends his time traveling the world for thrills and casually criticizing his wealthy peers for their lack of concern for the underprivileged. When a charity auction goes awry, Queen heads out on his boat to reevaluate his life. However, when his bodyguard betrays him, he ends up stranded on a tropical island, with only his wits and a makeshift bow to survive. At least, that is until the criminals using the island as a heroin farm show up…
Year One is essentially the evolution of Queen as a person, told as an action-packed thriller, and it is extremely effective. Jock’s art leans a bit toward the sketchy side but his panel layout and designs lend the book, and especially its action scenes, a very kinetic feel rather than static frames of fighting. Diggle’s writing style is just as effective, with little fluff and each panel moving the story along. His development of Queen is paced and natural, without any sudden 180s of attitude or tone. Queen’s evolution from casual activist to defender of the people is given a strong origin and never feels forced or campy. The story works on many levels, both as a great crime story, a superhero story, and a Cast Away-like survival story.
So if you’re interested in checking out comics for the first time and aren’t sure where to start, give Green Arrow: Year One a shot. It’s exciting, deep and better than most action films Hollywood churns out these days.

USG passed a resolution Tuesday supporting the installation of wireless Internet in Leavey and Doheny libraries, citing the high volume of people using the facilities and the inadequacy of the current technology.
“[USC’s Committee on Information Services] chooses 8-10 buildings to completely overhaul of stuff,” Residential Senator Juan Orjuela said. “Doheny and Leavey weren’t on the list … so this resolution is showing the students’ support for them.”
The process of upgrading the libraries’ technology is already underway.
“The libraries have been very cooperative,” John Baldo, director of University Affairs, said. “They have gotten a lot of complaints [about wireless]. It’s a really good partnership.”

Aside from the Grammy nominations in the fall, the announcement of Coachella’s line-up is arguably one of the most hyped events in the music industry’s year. In much the same way that Vogue’s September issue is said to set the tone for high fashion’s entire Fall season, the much anticipated release of the three-day music festival’s line-up is similarly influential in determining what direction mainstream-leaning indie music will take in the coming year. 

As Coachella becomes a beast greater than the sum of its performing parts, this is truer than ever.


 
So when the three biggest-name acts headlining Coachella this year are Jay-Z, Muse and Gorillaz, it’s not because the festival has completely sold out to KROQ, but because they are the new faces of what Coachella’s core music is.


 
Yes, there are the traditional indie-dream bands and come-up weirdness in the smaller print of the lineup (Mew, Yo LaTengo, Lucero, Beach House), but to purists accustomed to Rage Against the Machine reunions and former-Beatle comebacks, having Pavement open for the Gorillaz seems a little bit sacrilegious.


 
But giving electronic prog-metal and cartoonish hip-pop acts top-name treatment and featuring the hip-hop mogul who killed hip-hop in a solid spot on a stateside festival like Coachella (he already headlined England’s equally-as-epic Glastonbury), doesn’t complicate the area between mainstream pop and indie rock as much as fill it in.
 
Instead of tiptoeing around the already-blurred Pitchfork-defined boundaries of what is acceptable indie music, the Coachella curators have fully accepted the genre-bending culture-crossing amalgam that popular music has become and organized a three-day cross-section of popular music today.


 
Who says Jay-Z can’t headline a rock-oriented festival? And who is to say that Pavement would be more worthy? Looking at the big-text names on this year’s roster might make Coachella appear as though it has hit the corporate-sponsored mainstream jackpot (well, they did), but a look in the last year of mainstream music will prove that so-called indie rock has, too.


 
Check out the full lineup here: Coachella.com.

But giving electronic prog-metal and cartoonish hip-pop acts top-name treatment and featuring the hip-hop mogul who killed hip-hop in a solid spot on a stateside festival like Coachella (he already headlined England’s equally-as-epic Glastonbury), doesn’t complicate the area between mainstream pop and indie rock as much as fill it in.
 
Instead of tiptoeing around the already-blurred Pitchfork-defined boundaries of what is acceptable indie music, the Coachella curators have fully accepted the genre-bending culture-crossing amalgam that popular music has become and organized a three-day cross-section of popular music today.


 
Who says Jay-Z can’t headline a rock-oriented festival? And who is to say that Pavement would be more worthy? Looking at the big-text names on this year’s roster might make Coachella appear as though it has hit the corporate-sponsored mainstream jackpot (well, they did), but a look in the last year of mainstream music will prove that so-called indie rock has, too.

Too true. To be honest, I don’t even know half of the artists playing at Coachella this year. Oh well. Dream Coachella lineup: The Vines, AFI, The Offspring, Matisyahu, and Rage Against the Machine.

A team of doctors and nurses from USC’s Keck School of Medicine flew to Haiti Saturday as part of the worldwide effort to help the survivors of the country’s massive 7.0-magnitude earthquake that occurred last week.
The nine surgeons on the team are working along with another team led by Dr. Henri Ford, vice dean of medical education at Keck and chief of surgery at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, performing surgeries and providing medical assistance at the Israeli field hospital in Port-au-Prince.

Members of the team have been providing updates on their work through a new blog set up by Keck.
Ford, a Haitian native, recently sent an update about surgeries he performed on board the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.
“While on the ship, the chief medical officer [Dr. Alfred Shwayhat] asked me to stay to help with a young girl with a penetrating head trauma,” Ford wrote on the blog. “A roof collapsed on her and a piece of brick was embedded in her skull with extension to the brain. Last night, we removed most of the brick.”
To organize the team initially, Keck Dean Carmen Puliafito called Keck’s Director of Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Demetrios Demetriades. It took about 10 minutes for Demetriades to gather surgeons who were interested in going to Haiti, Puliafito said.
“We’ve got some great doctors at USC; because we staff the Los Angeles County Medical Center, we’ve got lots of experience with trauma,” Puliafito said. “It’s really gratifying to see how quickly people respond to this call.”
Although air traffic in and out of Haiti has been severely bottlenecked, the doctors were able to fly in on a private jet provided by Project Medishare Haiti and the Miami Global Institute.
The doctors are working together with colleagues from the University of Miami, the United Nations and the Israeli field hospital to provide aid, Puliafito said. He expects the team to be in Haiti for at least one or two weeks.

The surgeons on the team have been sending updates by text, e-mail and blog posts, but Puliafito said this can be a difficult task.
“They have a situation where electrical power is extremely scarce, and they’re conserving the battery on their cell phones,” he said.
Dr. Ramon Cestero, the surgeon who is heading the Keck team, sent blog updates about the conditions in Haiti.
“Outstanding facility, everyone being put to use,” Cestero wrote on the blog. “Team continuing to provide triage, orthopedic, trauma, ice, anesthesia and emergency care alongside Israeli field hospital personnel.”
In another update, Ford emphasized the need for aid after the devastating earthquake.
“Many people (hundreds if not thousands) living in tents just outside the clinic area. Some have been waiting to see a doctor since the earthquake,” he wrote. “The stories we are hearing are gut-wrenching.”

With the neighborhood council elections approaching, USC students currently on the council have begun searching for their replacements.
The Empowerment Congress North Area Neighborhood Development Council is a community forum that discusses issues of local importance and proposes ways to address them.
Samantha Foley and Daniel Wu, both graduating seniors, were appointed to the NANDC board last fall to maintain a USC voice on the council. They will vacate their spots early, however, to make room for USC students who will be able to represent the school in the future.
Foley, a senior majoring in international relations and political science, said it is important for USC to maintain a presence on the board, particularly to address myths or concerns about the university’s Master Plan, which involves significant neighborhood development.
“It’s all about clarification and communication, going back and forth,” Foley said. “It’s important with USC being such a large, involved part of the community. We need student perspective and voice.”
Shawn Simons, president of the neighborhood committee, said NANDC has always had student participation and stressed that a USC presence is integral to the council’s operations.
“It would be really terrible not to have USC students involved in the council,” Simons said. “They play an extremely active part that we hope will grow. We can’t reach out to students without a student representative.”
Foley and Wu have been in touch with various student groups to try to recruit potential candidates for the NANDC positions. Wu, a senior majoring in Los Angeles urban studies, said they are looking for students who will be at USC beyond this year, including freshmen, sophomores, juniors or seniors planning to do their graduate studies  at USC, to serve all or most of the two-year term on the NANDC board.
“It’s a good opportunity to get involved in key issues and make a difference,” Wu said.
At the next board meeting on Feb. 4, the council will have a special presentation about what it means to be a board member, Simons said. The council is hoping to pique the interest of students who might want to get involved in neighborhood affairs.
Ashley Ramos, a junior majoring in political science, plans on running because she said she wants to go into city planning and urban development after she graduates.
“It’s important being a representative for USC,” Ramos said. “It’s a first time thing, jumping in there and hoping I can learn a lot from the experience.”
Liam Powers, a sophomore majoring in political science and communication, is also seeking a NANDC position. He said he wants the position because of his interest in politics and government.
“I take pride in the city and want to have a greater level of input,” Powers said.
He said he was interested in Los Angeles and hoped he would be able to make changes to improve the city when and where they are needed.
Foley said she will be working closely with a few of the potential candidates for the rest of her time on the council.
“I have a good five weeks here, and I want the person replacing me to get into contact with my contacts for everything so they have these resources at their disposal,” Foley said.
Board members are elected by vote, and Foley said it is therefore crucial for candidates to reach out to any groups they are involved with to get people to vote.
“It’s all about follow-through,” Foley said. “You actually have to run a campaign.”
After the new board is elected positions will be appointed. Simons said the bylaws were revised this year, and the board will appoint a new seat for a USC student representative. Students can also be elected to positions besides student representative, however.
Simons emphasized that any USC student can run for any position, including president. There is no limit on the number of USC students that can be elected to the council. Jan. 26 is the last filing date for candidates, but Foley said until Feb. 25 students could apply to be write-in candidates. Voting takes place at the Hoover Recreation Center on March 27.

As photos and stories from Haiti continue to catch the public eye, students and professors on campus have undertaken various efforts to provide whatever help they can.
Much of Haiti has been ravaged and hundreds of thousands left dead by the large-scale earthquake that struck last week. To honor those lost and to help those in need of aid, the USC Office of Religious Life hosted a vigil Tuesday and the Annenberg School of Communication & Journalism hosted a CrisisCamp volunteer session Sunday.

Students and community members came together Tuesday at the interfaith vigil.
“The event was all about healing and grief, but it’s also about learning, and getting background,” said Rev. Jim Burklo. “Education is a big part of it; we want to get people interested in the history of the country as well as a spiritual response.”
The vigil began with Varun Soni, the dean for the Office of Religious Life, who gave the audience of about 25 a brief recap of what occurred in Haiti and of the earthquake’s destruction and its effects.
“Today we come together to support the people of Haiti and to support each other,” Soni said in his opening speech. “Today we bring together the spiritual and scholarly resources of our university in order to raise money and awareness for Haiti.”
Allyson Salinger Ferrante, a graduate student who is working on her dissertation on Caribbean literature, followed with a poem by René Dépestre titled Ballad of a Little Lamp.
“As students and members of a privileged community who have access to education among other basic things like food, clothes and shelter, we may feel that we are too small to really effect any change, but that’s not true,” Ferrante said. “Every dollar counts and the spread of information counts, and that doesn’t cost anything.”
Students who attended the event said they felt it was important to show support as a group.
“I think its important to unite our campus because a lot of us know people whose family members have been affected,” said Jillian Angeline, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism. “As the Haitian community is uniting, the students on campus should as well.”
Erica Edwards, a senior majoring in English who attended the event, said she hopes other students understand what happened.
“It’s important to take some time to reflect on Haiti, it’s really important to look at the larger picture and to see the world and see life globally as opposed to just our own life,” said Edwards. “It is important to make time for those who are in need. One day it could be us.”
Beyond the vigil, faculty and community members met Sunday to use their technological skills to help the relief effort as part of CrisisCamp Haiti, a program hosted by Annenberg.
More than 40 volunteers worked on various projects, including an open street map of Haiti and a family locator system. Others helped by translating messages into French and Haitian Creole.
“The idea was just to get people together and see what we can do,” said Andrew Lih, the Annenberg faculty member who organized the event in Los Angeles. “It’s tough to figure out the impact of what is going on here in Haiti, but at least we can use the technology to help.”
Lih said he is trying to organize another event but emphasized that volunteers should also undertake crisis-relief projects on their own.
“Events like this are really time sensitive, and some people say that even waiting a week to meet is too late,” Lih said.
