Pop artist Carlie Hanson has an upcoming EP and recently released “Goodbye” which was featured on the soundtrack for the Netflix original film, “Sierra Burgess Is a Loser.” She opened for pop singer Troye Sivan at the Greek Theatre Wednesday. (Dillon Matthew | Daily Trojan)
In the span of her burgeoning music career, 18-year old Carlie Hanson has transformed from a normal  girl from Wisconsin to a budding pop sensation with viral singles reaching over 50 million Spotify streams and spots on multiple nationwide tours with artists like Jeremy Zucker, Troye Sivan and Gnash. 
On Wednesday night, she opened for pop singer Troye Sivan at the Greek Theatre as part of his “Bloom” Tour. 
Hanson’s stage presence exuded confidence as her setlist was ideal for the upbeat, dance-filled atmosphere. The Daily Trojan sat down with Hanson to talk about her career so far and her plans for the future.
Daily Trojan: You played your first live show a little over six months ago. Where are you today as a artist compared to then?
Carlie Hanson: As an artist, I’ve grown into a more confident performer since my first show back in May. I remember that night. It was my birthday. My family was there so obviously I was nervous but, surprisingly, having them there singing every word to every song made my worries disappear. Now that I’ve been on these tours, doing this every night, I approach the stage with nothing but excitement. I’m at a point that I never thought I would be at.
DT: You’ve been on your first few tours since late September. What has it been like to play multiple shows every week?
CH: It’s way better than going to college. That’s what all my friends are doing. I used to work at McDonald’s. The fact that I can play shows every night and make a living out of that is unreal to me. It’s been nothing but fun and new experiences.
DT: It seems as if you’ve built a great network of artists and other musical influences since moving out to LA. What has it been like having a support group that includes notable pop artists like Troye Sivan?
CH: Troye is the only major artist I’ve gotten close to. It’s amazing learning from him, now being on his second tour. He’s really an inspiration to me. I haven’t really met a ton of other artists, so I’m kind of figuring it all out as I go.
DT: In an interview with Paper Magazine you said that you keep a journal with you to jot down possible concepts or ideas for future songwriting. Have you had any recent inspiration while on the road?
CH: Before the “Bloom” tour, I was touring with an artist named Jeremy Zucker. Every day we would be on the road for almost seven hours, just driving constantly so I would always be jotting down ideas. Unfortunately, some people broke into our tour van and stole a lot of gear and my bag, which had my journals in it. Obviously, all of the thoughts and ideas are still with me but having it written down helps. I haven’t really been thinking about formally writing and recording songs as much now that I’m touring.
DT: Who are your current favorite artists, and which artists are you currently listening to?
CH: Justin Bieber is the biggest inspiration for me and I grew up with him, One Direction and 5 Seconds of Summer. I was definitely that girl who loved all of them, but my mom is really into Nirvana and some hardcore metal bands like Five Finger Death Punch. I think that was the first band I ever saw live.
DT: An interesting first concert to say the least.
CH: Yeah so, I have that Rock inspiration/taste. However, I like the 1975 and a bunch of rap too. Lil Skies is this new rapper who I like a lot.
DT:  Do you take inspiration from other genres even though the songs you write are labeled as pop?
CH: I’m going to be putting out an EP soon and while it’s still pop, it will have a lot more guitar instrumentals, which has come from my current obsessions with indie rock and alternative bands. But also I love rap and there are some songs that go harder with urban, trap beats that all flows together really well. It’s gonna be interesting!
DT: A little under two weeks ago you released a new single called “Toxins”, in which you talk about an unhealthy relationship that came along shortly after moving to a new place. A few lines that resonated heavily with me were the lyrics “my iPhone might be bad for my health, but when its dying, feel like dying myself”. Do you think that technology, like smartphones, plays a huge role in relationships today?
CH: For sure! It’s what our life is now. Especially within the music industry there’s this strive to connect with anyone and everyone all the time, which I don’t love because I’d rather be present and talk with people in real life. It really is an addiction, but I also have a love-hate relationship with it. I love memes, YouTube, and talking to people I can’t immediately be with but I feel like eventually I’m going to need to take a break from it all for myself. It’s something everyone should do.
DT: As an 18-year-old, you have your whole career ahead of you. Do you have any specific goals or places you’ve always wanted to play?
CH:  I love Justin Bieber. One day I want to meet him, but the obvious dream is wanting to play Madison Square Garden. But, c’mon, when am I gonna meet Justin Bieber? He’s the reason why I’m so into music and here today.
DT: You recently had a song in the soundtrack for “Sierra Burgess Is a Loser.” Did you write that song for the movie?
CH: No, I wrote “Goodbye” about a year and a half ago. I had the song done for a while and my manager somehow got connected with them and it was put into the soundtrack! They said it really fit the themes addressed in the movie. Unfortunately it’s not actually in the film, and when I finally watched “Sierra” there were so many spots where it would’ve fit.
DT: “Goodbye” seems like one of your most honest songs yet, not only because of its slower tempo, but also your vocals. Was that influenced by the lyrics and tone of the song?
CH: Pain. It was gloomy outside and I think we wrote it in someone’s garage. I didn’t have a song like it that showed off my voice in that way. I don’t really know how it came about, I wasn’t in a relationship or anything but my heart was broken for some reason.
DT: As someone who is the same age as you, I relate and understand the motifs of our generation, rebellion and strive to just “do our own thing”. Do you think that the demographic of your songs is primarily people of our own age?
CH: I definitely think that the songs I write are primarily for audiences of our generation. I find myself talking about my friends a lot in my music, and taking stories from their lives. I think it’s because I’m young and this is just exactly what I’m going through. Plus, I just continue to strive to make music that I would like to listen to.
DT: Where does Carlie Hanson go from here?
CH: I just want to keep being on tour! I’ll be putting that EP out soon, and I’m going on tour with Gnash after this tour with [Sivan] ends. After that, I’ll be going to Thanksgiving dinner and headed to Christmas. Might chop my hair off, dye it a different color, so keep an eye out!

Adriana Sanchez | Daily Trojan
It’s 3 a.m. and dozens of people are talking loudly in a gas station parking lot. 
It’s a colorful array of people: a group of girls in nice dresses and heels, a pack of grisly middle-aged bikers, a couple of college kids sniffling in their sweatshirts. People chatter, and each raised voice is a desperate attempt to float above the others in a neat line ahead of them, all staring at a glorious spit of roasting pork. 
Under the glare of floodlights, half of a fraternity shovels in 55 tacos on a portable black table. A mother and daughter stare at the boys while filling a plastic produce bag full of onions, salsa and limes. 
In all my life, at every cheap and casual restaurant I’ve ever been to, I’ve never seen a crowd of diners as diverse as that at Leo’s Tacos. 
I step up to the cashier and order three tacos al pastor. Anything on the menu is probably good, but I wouldn’t know — nor would many of its patrons, because Leo’s has the absolute best, readily available al pastor in Los Angeles. The cashier nods and I hand over a $5 bill. The average price per taco at Leo’s Tacos is $1.25. 
Leo’s Tacos (or Tacos Leo depending on who you ask) has only been around for a few years, but it has cemented itself not only as a late-night destination, but also as one of the best taco trucks in the city. 
No truck or stand quite matches the enthusiasm and legacy of Leo’s Tacos (sorry Tacozone — the affectionately named taco stand operating out of Vermont Avenue’s Autozone near USC). Every night, after the bars and clubs close, people flock to the orange-and-yellow painted trucks across the city. Leo’s Tacos has six trucks at regular locations, but it wouldn’t be surprising to see several more join the fleet in the coming years. 
Cars rip in and out of the gas station parking lot as time goes on. People are driving to Leo’s Tacos in its closing minutes, desperate for a late-night snack, lured by the irresistible whisper of sizzling pork. Some come from 20, 30, 40 minutes away. The trip is worth it to them.
Leo’s Tacos is iconic. It feels authentic to Mexico, or at least authentic to Mexican immigrants living in Los Angeles. It feels like a light cast on the dark, empty part of Los Angeles — it buffers the brutality of a 2 a.m. bar close. It feels honest.
Al pastor, a Mexican food truck staple, began as a borrowed food from another country. 
In the late 19th century, Lebanese immigrants flooded Mexico, to escape the control of the Ottoman Empire. As they settled in Mexico, the Lebanese brought their traditions, including the döner kebab. Traditional Lebanese döner kebab consists of seasoned meat, typically mutton, stacked in an upside-down cone and grilled on a rotating spit next to an open flame. 
When the Lebanese recreated this dish in Mexico, they used mutton, a meat from sheep. As it 
became popular with Mexicans, it got the name “al pastor,” which means “shepard style.” As time progressed, pork, the much more popular protein in Mexico substituted lamb. Mexican spices were added, and a pineapple was placed on top of the spit. 
A man cuts razor-thin slices of al pastor from the spit next to the truck and lays them out on three corn tortillas. He does the same with the pineapple on top, crowning each taco with a slice of yellow fruit. I take a first, unadorned bite and stifle a grin as I’m greeted with impossibly tender pork cradled in a warm tortilla. Pineapple juice seeps into some of the al pastor, adding a refreshing sweetness that cuts through the fat and spice. 
Leo’s Tacos feels true to Los Angeles. Al pastor feels true to Mexico. 
The Lebanese döner kebab has spread across the globe, and is replicated in countries across Europe and the Middle East. But Mexican al pastor still feels special.
Across the Atlantic Ocean, I’m sure there’s a gyro place that feels true to the heart of Greece as Leo’s Tacos is to Los Angeles. In Germany, it’s probably a döner kebab place. Across the Middle East, it might be a shawarma and kebab spot. 
In a way, the variety and prevalence of döner kebab feels like a universal mirror held against the diverse crowd waiting in line at Leo’s Tacos. Every person and group has had a different night, with different tones and feelings. But all gather for the same purpose.
Meat on a spit has an international power. It has a power to unite people, despite all differences, through the mutual goal of consuming tender, roasted meat next to a flame. Perhaps this commonality could bring people closer together, not only across the city of Los Angeles but across the entire planet. Or, perhaps, I’m just really enjoying these al pastor tacos.

Photo from USC Department of Public Safety.
The Department of Public Safety and Los Angeles Police Department located a child who went missing Wednesday at the Health Sciences Campus.
Saul Perez, a 13-year-old Hispanic boy, was found at the Greyhound Bus Station at 7th Street and Central Avenue, according to DPS Captain Edgar Palmer. Perez was reunited with his family and was found unharmed.
He had last been seen on the fourth-floor lobby of the Keck Hospital of USC — four miles away from the station where he was located.
Perez’s father, who is disabled, told authorities he allowed his son with autism to use the restroom, assuming he would come out later, Palmer said. 
Palmer said that because the situation entailed a child with a disability, the situation was considered a critical missing person case.
At 1:25 p.m. the story was updated to include information regarding the child’s whereabouts.

Sweet surprise · Located on South Vermont Avenue, Celaya Bakery is owned by Joe Moreno and known for its Mexican bread and made-to-order cakes. (Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan)
Like Celaya Bakery itself, Joe Moreno — owner, manager and chef of this South Vermont Avenue panadería — is a Los Angeles tradition. Baking runs in his blood. 
“I’m a fourth-generation baker,” Moreno said. “It stretches back to my great-grandfathers on both sides. So my whole life has been about baking.” 
His expertise is evident in his pastry creations. Celaya is best known for its pan dulce, a sweet Mexican bread, and its custom cakes — especially its tres leches cake, sold whole and by the slice.
Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan
It is served drenched in a thick custard milk — the lifeblood of the cake — with a hint of spices that are hard to pinpoint, but feel familiar nonetheless. 
The cake comes chilled, and the fluffiness of the sponge provides a welcome contrast to the dense topping. Each slice is topped with a sprinkle of crispy chocolate pearls and a swirl of whipped cream.
Celaya Bakery is named after a city in the Mexican state of Guanajuato, where Moreno’s grandfather, who founded the South L.A. establishment, was born. Moreno said that at one time, his family owned over a dozen bakeries in the greater Los Angeles area; and though only two remain today, its family-run legacy continues. 
“Since I was a kid, I was not at a house where we watched Saturday morning cartoons,” Moreno said. “I was working, but I didn’t really call it work back then. I had to be [in the bakery], but at the same time I know it was where I was supposed to be.”
Much of the panadería’s offerings are served grab-and-go style with glass shelves lining the walls and center of the shop. These shelves are filled with rows and rows of classic American treats like chocolate chip cookies alongside traditional Mexican pastries like conchas.
Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan
Moreno is obviously no stranger to hard work, and he has kept this work ethic up even decades later, in the ways he serves the South L.A. community. 
“We provide jobs for a lot of people, as well as a good place to eat and to get custom cakes,” Moreno said. “I like to do things with the schools around here, like field trips with the elementary schools.”
The reputation the bakery has created for itself likely has to do with Moreno’s own passions. When asked about his favorite dish to cook or dessert to bake, Moreno replies without hesitation: “cake.” 
The experimental and ever-changing nature of cake creation is what draws Moreno to the craft. 
“I try to go for something different every time,” Moreno said. “I’m inspired by just wanting to learn how to do things, even things I’ve never seen done before.”

Freshman starting quarterback JT Daniels cleared concussion protocol and is expected to play on Saturday at Oregon State, head coach Clay Helton announced. Daniels suffered a concussion against Utah on Oct. 20. 
“We’ll be preparing him and [redshirt freshman quarterback Jack Sears],” Helton said. “But things are looking good [for Daniels]. We’ll keep him out of contact and monitor him but have all anticipation of him being ready for the game.”
The offense has 12 total touchdowns and an average of 243.25 yards per game in eight games, attesting to their subpar performance and Helton’s decision to take over play-calling and fire offensive line coach Neil Callaway.
Daniels praised Sears for filling in against Arizona State on Saturday. He went 20 of 28 with two touchdown passes. 
“[Sears] was phenomenal,” Daniels said. “You go from not taking reps in practice, to being the starter in a week. He threw some great ones. I think [Sears] did more than his part to help the team win.” 
Daniels has had an up-and-down season, with an 8:7 touchdown-to-interception ratio in seven games. Regardless, Helton is eager to have him back, as the Trojans seemingly are looking ahead to next season and beyond.
“I’m confident in [Daniels] and what he’s done for our football team,” Helton said.
Daniels did take a majority of the first string reps in practice as he gets accustomed to Helton’s play-calling style. Playing a 2-6 Oregon State team that has given up at least 25 points in every game this year should be the perfect opportunity for the two to build chemistry.
“He only does what he thinks is right for the team,” Daniels said. “To be honest, the play-calling doesn’t really affect my job too much. I can’t blame the play-caller unless every player is executing, and we aren’t scoring, which isn’t the problem. Players [have to] execute. That’s the first thing.” 
Injury update
Freshman safety Talanoa Hufanga, who leads the team in tackles, is out for the season with a broken clavicle suffered against ASU. Senior right tackle Chuma Edoga is day-to-day with a hyperextended knee. Sophomore linebacker Levi Jones suffered a hip injury and is still recovering.

Sophomore driver Jacob Mercep is tied for the highest scorer on the team this season with 50. (Jo Danielle Esteban | Daily Trojan)
The top-ranked USC Trojans (25-1) picked up their 25th win of the season on Saturday at Uytengsu Aquatics Center in a 10-5 victory over the No. 5 Pacific Tigers (7-11).
Six Trojans scored to aid in the takedown. Freshman driver Hannes Daube and sophomore driver Jacob Mercep both contributed hat tricks.
Daube and Mercep were the ones to start the scoring momentum, putting USC at a 2-0 lead in the first period. After 14 drives without either side netting a goal, freshman two-meter Jake Ehrhart put up a goal in the second period to give the Trojans a three-point lead. Pacific managed to get onto the scoreboard one minute and 48 seconds before halftime.
The third period saw big momentum and consistent scoring from both sides. Sophomore driver Marko Vavic scored off an assist from Mercep for his 50th goal of the season. Pacific answered back, but sophomore driver Sawyer Rhodes scored a skip shot goal to give the Trojans a three-goal lead – once again – at 5-2. Mercep followed by putting up his second score of the day. Pacific responded almost immediately before Daube scored his second goal of the game to let the Trojans lead 7-4 at the end of the third period.
USC did not let up in the final frame, scoring a burst of three unanswered goals from Mercep, Daube, and junior driver Marin Dasic. Pacific netted one final goal for a 10-5 finish.
“[Freshman goalie Nic Porter] shut it down early and killed their hopes,” redshirt junior Daniel Leong said. 
The Trojans played solid defense, giving up only one goal in the first half. The defense was anchored by Porter, who had seven saves throughout the game. 
“We didn’t really get flowing offensively until later in the game, but I think our defense kept us ahead,” Mercep said. “We certainly played a good defense, kept them on five goals even, though some goals we could’ve avoided.”
Pacific sophomore goalie John Hedges anchored their defense with 9 saves. This was his tenth straight game recording five or more saves. Junior Luis Araya lead the Tigers in scoring with three goals, his third hat trick of the season. Freshman Jonathan Cooper and freshman Aidan Jang had scores of their own.
In the week leading up to this match, the team did a good job of analyzing the Tigers’ game and preparing for what was coming. 
“Every week we go through their rotations and some of the plays that we know they’re running,” Leong said. “So we just try to prepare ourselves for that, study their plays and study how they play us a little differently. They have two lefties that were really good so we made it a point to shut them down. The center is also really strong so those were the main points.”
Next week, USC hosts Cal on Nov. 3 at 1 p.m. at Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The game will be broadcasted on television on the Pac-12 network. The Trojans will travel to UC Irvine on Sunday for another 1 p.m.  matchup.
Both Mercep and Leong say that intensity will be a key focus in the games next weekend. 
“The most important thing is to come out with a lot of energy,” Leong said. “When we’re playing teams like that, momentum can be huge in those games. So we kind of just have to start off firing from the beginning and hopefully get an early lead.”

The thing I love most about sports is that everyone can have an opinion about something pertaining to it. 
Oftentimes, there is no universal correct answer that solves each individual situation. Sports debates are great because they are open-ended.
Sports bring people together. Two people who are completely different can be united by their bond over a team. Sports can spark conversations that otherwise would not have happened. It is the ultimate unifier.
Of course, there are experts that have more knowledge about a particular sport than others, but even the experts don’t have all the solutions. 
No matter their gender, race, or intelligence, every person is entitled to have their own sports opinion and should not be criticized when they express them.
President Donald Trump is subjected to a lot of scrutiny for his tweets. Ever since he ran for office, Trump’s use of Twitter constantly made headlines for the controversy it sparked. Just this Saturday, Trump sparked outrage again for a tweet about the World Series.
“Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings. It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose & dominating through almost 7 innings, Rich Hill of Dodgers, and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked. 4 run lead gone. Managers do it all the time, big mistake!” Trump tweeted.
In recent years, Twitter has been the best social media outlet for people to express their sports viewpoints. My Twitter, for instance, is typically filled with opinions about my favorite soccer team, Liverpool F.C., and its performances. It is understood that any sports-related tweet is subject to other fans commenting their opinion. The sports Twitter world is harsh and often contains rude or nasty responses when someone tweets about a particular topic. 
While I do not advocate for cruelty toward others over their respective opinions, I understand that it is part of the world of sports in which debates can often-times get heated. The line, however, is crossed when a person tells another they should not have an opinion in the first place. Everyone should be able to speak their mind freely when it comes to sports.
Trump’s tweet on Saturday night was met with a backlash from people who argued that he shouldn’t be tweeting about the game. Many people were adamant that they could care less about his opinion and that he shouldn’t even have one in the first place.
The tweet followed a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue earlier in the day where 11 people died. Many said that his focus should be on the victims of the attack and not on the baseball game.
“There was a mass shooting yesterday,” Dodgers pitcher Rich Hill explained to reporters when asked about Trump’s tweet. “The focus, in my opinion, of the president is to be on the country and not on moves that are made in a World Series game.”
As a Jewish person, I agree that Trump needed to focus his attention on the shooting space. However, after a long day of work, everyone should be entitled to sit back and unwind. For many people, sports is the best outlet of doing so. At 11:46 p.m., anyone is entitled to take a break from his or her stressful work life, and enjoy watching a game of baseball if they choose to do so.
This also begs the question of whether or not politics and sports should be separate from one another. Should the president be allowed to talk about sports?
I think yes — but it’s more complicated. Many athletes have spoken out against Trump, so it is a double standard for them to speak out against politics. 
However, it is also expected that athletes take a more socially conscious stance and speak their minds about politics. LeBron James has been widely applauded for his outspoken rhetoric against Trump. This praise is justified.
There should not be a double standard between politicians and athletes and whether they should be able to speak about one another. 
If the general expectation is that athletes speak up about political injustices, it would be unfair to say that presidents cannot speak about sports. 
As a kid, I loved watching former president Barack Obama make his March Madness bracket during the NCAA season. I would always use his bracket as a reference and try to compete against him. I like it when politicians are humanized through their love for sports.
While I may not agree with Trump on many aspects, I know that he and I have a bond over our love for sports. While I may not agree with all of his sports opinions, I won’t neglect his right to have one.

Sophomore Daniel Cukierman claimed the Southern California Intercollegiate Singles title on Monday at home. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Top seeded men’s tennis sophomore Daniel Cukierman captured the Southern California Intercollegiate Singles title after a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory in the finals over Stanford’s senior Sameer Kumar on Monday at David Marks Stadium. 
On the singles side, freshman Bradley Frye had to qualify for the tournament, which was hosted by USC, while his three teammates were direct entries into the event. In the singles main draw, Frye was the only Trojan who lost. Cukierman advanced with a tight 6-0, 4-6, 6-4 win. Junior Riley Smith and senior Jack Jaede both had an easier time with a 6-2, 6-4 win and a 6-2, 6-1, respectively. 
The Round of 16 saw all three remaining Trojans advance: Cukierman with a 6-4, 6-2 victory, Jaede with a 6-3, 6-2 win and Smith with a 6-4, 6-4 upset of the eight seed. The quarterfinals Saturday proved to be less fortuitous, as both Smith and Jaede fell to the two and four seeds in three sets. However, Cukierman advanced with a 6-2, 6-3 win over freshman Eric Hahn from UCLA.
“[Head coach Peter Smith] told me that he wanted me to use my legs a lot, move forward with the ball, take it early and come to the net,” Cukierman said.
Cukierman pulled out a hard fought 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 win to reach the finals in Sunday’s semifinals. He played in his first college singles championship on Monday and joined his teammates, seniors Laurens Verboven and Logan Smith, as a preseason individual collegiate tournament winner.
“We had a tough, very long match,” Cukierman said. “Both of us had [a] tough match yesterday with three sets … [Kumar is] a great player and a great guy. He played very well first set, and then I came back second set [for a] tough third set.”
The doubles side saw success from both teams as Frye and Jaede paired up and Smith joined Cukierman. The fourth-seeded team of Frye and Jaede reached the semifinals with wins over UC Irvine and UCLA. They eventually fell in the semifinals to the second seeded team of Kumar and sophomore Timothy Sah from Stanford. Smith and Cukierman were the top seed for the tournament and reached the semifinals with wins over Texas Tech and UC Irvine. The pair then lost in the semifinals to Azusa Pacific University. 
“These are my first matches here at ’SC on these courts,” Frye said. “I’ve practiced here for the last two months, but this is my first match outside of that. I was nervous at first but it was awesome being out there with the team … it was fun, it didn’t end the way we needed it to, but we had fun.”
The Trojans had a good showing in the consolation draw. After losing to junior Josh Ortlip of Cal Poly during the first round of singles in the main draw, Frye advanced to the semifinals where he beat junior Antoine Noel 6-2, 6-1. Due to the absence of his finals opponent, freshman Matheus Leite from Texas Tech, Frye won by default in the singles championship in the consolation draw. 
“I’m feeling great with a bunch of great guys,” Frye said. “[It’s my] first year here … it’s super exciting.”
The Trojans will participate in the Jack Kramer Invitational in Palos Verdes Nov. 1 -4.

Redshirt freshman Jack Sears looks for receivers against Arizona State on Saturday at the Coliseum. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
The life of any backup quarterback is generally filled with uncertainty. The competitions during summer and fall camp practices, the struggles to develop chemistry with receivers and backs due to limited practice time, the time spent relaying calls and encouraging teammates from the sideline, waiting for an opportunity to make their own mark.
For redshirt freshman Jack Sears, the one thing he could feel certain about was his own playing ability. 
When he finally got his chance to take the field on Saturday against Arizona State, he made sure audiences knew that he had what it takes to play at the collegiate level.
“It’s been a while since I’ve been in a game setting,” Sears said. “We did our best in fall camp and my entire time here.”
Despite playing in a losing effort, Sears showed flashes of brilliance and the capacity to lead a football team.
“I felt comfortable in the second half and guys never stopped believing in me,” Sears said. “It was fun to rally with them and keep competing. We fought to the very end.”
On the day, Sears went 20-of-28 passing for 235 yards with two touchdowns. Additionally, Sears was a factor on the ground, participating in a number of designed roll-outs, options and runs, including a 22-yard burst to set up a touchdown drive at the end of the first half. Sears was not the most statistically impressive passer on the roster on Saturday — that title went to redshirt sophomore wideout Tyler Vaughns, who threw a 36-yard touchdown to junior receiver Michael Pittman in the third quarter. However, Sears was capable of producing when called upon for the USC offense.
In fact, out of qualifying passers, Sears finished fourth among Pac-12 quarterbacks in terms of passer grade, according to PFF College. Finishing ahead of talented signal callers such as Stanford’s K.J. Costello, Utah’s Tyler Huntley and Arizona State’s Manny Wilkins, Sears clearly stood out compared to the expectations most would have of a backup quarterback.
The most impressive factor of Sears’ performance, however, was his ability to lead the Trojans back from a daunting deficit. With just under two minutes left in the first half, USC trailed the Sun Devils by 17 points and had yet to show any life on the offensive side of the ball. Aside from a brilliant Vaughns punt return for a touchdown following Arizona State’s first drive, USC had been shut out. 
Yet, Sears was able to drive his team 90 yards down the field to cut the deficit to 10 by halftime. Coming out of the break, Sears again carved through the Sun Devils’ secondary to bring USC within 3 points, and 25 seconds later, USC took the lead.
While the defense and special teams would falter and the Trojans would go on to fall for the first time at home since 2015, Sears made sure to leave a lasting good impression with a 48-yard heave for a touchdown to Vaughns in Sears’ last play from scrimmage.
From the perspective of head coach Clay Helton, this type of performance was anything but out of the ordinary for the San Clemente native. 
“[Sears] practices like a starter, and today he played like a starter,” Helton said after the game.
Helton continued to shower the redshirt freshman in praise for his performance.
“I thought [Sears] did a tremendous job,” Helton said. 
However, Sears does not have a particularly clear path to playing time. With presumptive starter JT Daniels cleared to resume practicing following a concussion suffered on Oct. 20 at Utah, Sears will likely serve in a backup role once again this weekend when the team travels to Oregon State.
This should not spell the end of Sears’ chances to contribute moving forward. Sears and Daniels both have freshman eligibility and considering how tumultuous the season has been, it is unlikely that a week-to-week starter is guaranteed, let alone one from year-to-year. Additionally, should Daniels show further health concerns, it is possible that Sears could once again get the nod over Fink.
It wasn’t long ago that a San Clemente quarterback took a loss in his first start as a Trojan.
While Jack Sears may not have performed as well as former USC quarterback Sam Darnold, he certainly showed enough on Saturday to make it clear that he is capable of being an effective starter when called upon for USC.
“I love these guys; I’ve been with them for over two years,” Sears said of his teammates. “I believe in what [Helton is] doing here. Every down, every play, no matter what’s going on. I love this university.”

Angela Carter’s collection of short stories, “The Bloody Chamber,” subverts classic fairytales and their heroines. (Photo courtesy of Vintage Classics)
The fact that my column is running on Halloween is, I feel, wasted on me, as I am far from a horror connoisseur. 
Even watching “Buzzfeed Unsolved” sends a shiver down my spine. Nevertheless, I do love getting into the holiday spirit, and there’s one collection of creepy short stories that I thoroughly enjoy — Angela Carter’s “The Bloody Chamber.”
“The Bloody Chamber” comprises 10 short stories, each based on a fairy or folk tale. The titular short story is based on the legend of Bluebeard; “The Courtship of Mr. Lyon” and “The Tiger’s Bride” on “Beauty and the Beast;” “Puss-in-Boots” on, well, puss-in-boots; “The Erl-King” on the myth of a forest sprite; “The Snow Child” on Snow White; “The Lady of the House of Love” on Sleeping Beauty; and “The Werewolf,” “The Company of Wolves,” and “Wolf-Alice” all on elements of “Little Red Riding Hood.”
The stories were first published in 1979, so the prose is a little antiquated. Carter writes in an elevated, florid style; imagine a musty, leather-bound volume with gilded edges, a ribbon bookmark and a foil-stamped, embossed cover. That’s the kind of grandeur you’d expect this book to be bound in, and Carter’s writing is what you’d expect to find inside.
But there’s a reason why the stories in “The Bloody Chamber” have been anthologized in contemporary textbooks and course readers over and over. Every story is from the perspective of a female protagonist, and they are all shrewd and cunning, dangerous and vicious, all possessing a significant streak of savagery. These are no meek damsels in distress. 
After she realizes her lover intends to trap her forever by transforming her into a bird, the protagonist in “The Erl-King” strangles him with his own hair in a bid to preserve her freedom. 
In “The Werewolf,” Little Red Riding Hood murders her grandmother so she can come into her inheritance early. 
In “The Bloody Chamber,” the sadistic Marquis is about to kill his innocent young bride by lopping off her head — until her mother, with whom she’d coordinated, bursts into the room and rescues her from the guillotine with the assistance of a gun. They live happily ever after — indulging liberally, I might add — in the Marquis’ riches. 
Revamped fairy tales, or fairy tales “with a twist,” are a genre unto itself (see: Disney movies, “Once Upon a Time” or literally any young adult fantasy novel). The stories of the Brothers Grimm are in the public domain, which means they’re fair game, and have consequently been shoved down our throats since birth. At this point, they’ve been dissected, deconstructed and done to death. It’s hard to imagine that anything fresh can be brought to Cinderella, even if they make her a cyborg.
But even after 40 years, Carter’s short stories feel revolutionary. With her sumptuous prose and ornate trappings, Carter evokes the conventions of Gothic fiction, yet she also subverts them by writing powerful, ruthless heroines rather than the weak-willed, mealy-mouthed women typical of the genre. 
Carter imbues “The Bloody Chamber” with a distinctly feminist air, exploring themes of female identity, sexuality, liberation, corruption and perversion. The scariest aspect of “The Bloody Chamber” isn’t the carnage, bloodlust or blatant psychopathy — it’s the recognition that women, too, are capable of them.

Ankita Mukherji’s exhibition “Memorabilia” is on display at the Helen Lindhurst Gallery until Nov. 8. The project is an exploration of memory and the concept of home. (Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan)
A visit to Roski School of Art and Design student Ankita Mukherji’s new exhibit in the Helen Lindhurst Gallery feels like a trip home. 
Most homes aren’t composed solely of sculptures; nor are they hazy in their outlines and sparse in organization. And it’s unlikely that one would see a giant piece of sculpted pie on an oblique black table, or a window painted with fake scenery, when looking at a picture of home.
But that’s to say nothing of the homes that exist in our minds. Try imagining home. Suddenly, once-clear memories may seem fuzzy. Is that chair in the living room more blue or more teal? And how tall is the coffee table exactly? 
Often, what we remember about home is not the real thing, but the diminished memory of it.  
Mukherji’s exhibit, dubbed “Memorabilia,” instinctively reflects this. A fine arts student in Roski, Mukherji described her latest work as “an exploration of the concept of home, and how it is constructed through the images and objects we see around us on a daily basis.” 
“My constructed domestic spaces are drawn from my own memories of places I have lived in, or from images of home that I have consumed growing up, and I hope for viewers to be able to project their own memories and experiences on them,” she wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Mukherji, who was born in India, raised in Singapore and now in Los Angeles for college, said that her upbringing contextualizes why she became interested with the idea of home. 
“This show is a manifestation of my struggle and subsequent coming to terms with the constructed nature of home, and the false sense of permanence it implies,” Mukherji wrote.
The resulting sculptures from Mukherji’s musings are simultaneously detailed, yet vague as memory itself. 
At first glance, some of the sculptures appear rudimentary — not in their implementation, but in their basic outlines. 
With closer examination, more refined images of home emerge.  These images encourage the audience to wonder where this home Mukherji has constructed might be and whom it might belong to. 
A quote at the entrance to the gallery reads: “Together we generate meaning into the world even as it unfolds before us. Thought is a stream of signs and symbols, strung together, perpetuating and defining our existence. Interpretation depends on the interpreting subject as the sign depends on the object.” 
It is the details within the outlines of Mukherji’s sculptures that can remind even the most casual viewer that this memory of home may have once belonged to someone else.   
“Memorabilia” runs Monday through Friday from Oct. 29 to Nov. 8, with a reception on Nov. 1 at 5 p.m. 
Visitors may be tempted to sign something familiar to many home gatherings — the guestbook at the front.

In December 2016, the California Supreme Court ruled that it is illegal for companies to force employees to work during their designated breaks.  Proposition 11 was drafted in anticipation of this standard being applied to privately-employed paramedics and emergency medical technicians, who make up about 75 percent of emergency medical workers in the state. 
Prop 11 would address three different components: being on-call during breaks, which is its most vital portion; additional training for respondents; and mental health services for these workers. All three aspects create a bill with positive benefits to both the working emergency respondents and the society they serve. 
To maintain the safety and efficacy of the state’s emergency services, it is imperative that Californians vote yes on Prop 11. 
The standard operating procedure for emergency response workers is to remain on call during paid work breaks. The outcome of a medical emergency is heavily dependent on the response time of emergency services. According to the Journal of Emergency Medical Services, “emergency calls where response times were less than five minutes were associated with improved survival when compared with calls where response times exceeded five minutes.” 
Carol Meyer, a former director of the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency, worries that response rates will increase: “The ambulance may be three minutes away, five minutes away, 10 minutes away … the bottom line is that it’s further than the one that’s around the corner.” Each minute is precious.
Ambulances typically have no permanent location, which helps improve response times. Instead, they follow a practice known as “posting.” First, respondents are strategically positioned in order to anticipate 911 calls. 
When the call comes, the closest ambulance is expected to respond, and the remaining ambulances reposition themselves to effectively cover parameters for the next call. This minimizes both response rates and ambulance crews. 
If Prop 11 fails to pass, companies would collectively have to spend up to $100 million a year on the extra staff and ambulances needed to cover the gaps when EMTs and paramedics take breaks, and the cost would be passed on to taxpayers, according to the fiscal impact statement released by the state’s legislative analyst and director of finance. However, if the measure passes, the money saved would benefit local governments. This is not at the financial expense of the workers. Though their paid breaks may be interrupted, EMTs and paramedics often have a significant amount of downtime between calls.
One of Prop 11’s added benefits is additional training for the paramedics and EMTs. These trainings aim to prepare for natural disasters, active shooters and violence prevention. With 5,527 California fires across 620,858 acres in 2018, and mass shootings occurring alarmingly frequently across America, it is imperative that respondents be  properly trained to react appropriately and quickly to these circumstances. Because there are special precautions that must be taken into account in every emergency, any additional experience would help respondents save more lives.
The service that paramedics and EMTs provide their community is widely recognized, and Prop  11 is designed to help these workers better aid those who are in need of it. One particular example is the measure’s proposal to require coverage of mental health services for paramedics and EMTs, who are often in high-stress situations. 
Prop 11 would require annual mental health education and coverage in insurance plans. It also requires private ambulance operators to maintain high enough staff levels to generally provide coverage for breaks. 
Unfortunately, emergencies are frequent occurrences of daily life. It is critical that we are provided with well-trained and responsive staff, as they could be the difference between life and death. For the sake of our public safety throughout the state of California, please vote yes on Prop 11 on Nov. 6.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
From a slew of bomb threats directed at Democratic leaders to a devastating, anti-Semitic mass shooting in Pittsburgh, last week’s events indicate how these are dangerous times we’re living in.
Violence sparked by bigotry and paranoia have claimed the lives of vulnerable Americans, as cultural and political leaders who dissent and criticize the president and Republican Party are targeted. In the face of these harrowing realities, equivocation from politicians and media about those responsible for in these events places the American people in abject danger.
It’s a dangerous time for unchecked false equivalencies.
Whenever a man is accused of sexual assault, it seems that the real issue of sexual violence is given the same weight as the conservative outcry about “due process.” This reflects a deeper issue. We simply can’t allow rape apologists and — as we saw in the confirmation of alleged sexual abuser Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court — Republican politicians who prioritize their political agenda over survivors’ lives. Their power allows them to have equal influence with women and survivors in controlling narratives around sexual violence in the media.
In a similar vein, we can’t allow politicians who ignore scientific facts and attempt to strip transgender people of equal access to platforms, credibility and moral authority.
Donald Trump has incited, condoned and glorified violence. In the aftermath of a journalist’s violent murder in Saudi Arabia, Trump praised a GOP congressman convicted of body-slamming a journalist on camera. He has repeatedly offered to pay legal fees for supporters who physically attack anti-Trump protesters, and, at a 2016 campaign rally, bemoaned the good old days when there was more violence.
Presently, the president has relied on anti-Semitic dog whistling, referencing “globalist” plots and promoting conspiracy theories that prominent Jewish Democratic donors like George Soros (one recipient of a suspicious package last week) are funding a caravan of Central American migrants that, he claims, is coming to hurt and threaten white Americans.
The perpetrator of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting referenced this conspiracy theory on social media as his motivation for the attack.
The majority party’s stubborn, financially motivated refusal to pass popular common sense gun control is inseparable from the constant violence in America. When Trump and other right-wing leaders claim churches and schools should either arm themselves or expect to be attacked, they’re simply saying that they would rather convert schools and places of worship into security-packed zones than decline NRA donations.
Direct incitements or praise for violence from the most powerful person in the country are by no means as “evil” as calling on Americans to question and confront elected officials they see in public about their voting records, as Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters did over the summer.
Many of the elected officials who have been publicly protested haven’t held town halls in months or years, failing to create civil spaces for listening to constituents; coincidentally, many of these officials have actively contributed to humanitarian crises, or dehumanized and erased survivors en masse. They deserve to be questioned about this.
In many ways, our country is indeed at a crossroads, as politicians of all party affiliations have suggested. We face a crisis of national identity, but that is not a crisis of manners: It is a crisis of mass violence targeting marginalized people; of leaders using their power to enable and equivocate in the face of violence to uphold political hegemony.
Within the Democratic Party, there are certainly shortcomings in serving marginalized people; but Democratic leaders lack the numbers and ability to fully counteract bigoted Republican policies. Nor have Democratic leaders in recent history shrugged off violence, as the Republican president so frequently does. It is true that there are always two or more sides to a story, but not all are deserving of equal weight.

USC community members gather and pray in the University Religious Center courtyard Tuesday to honor the victims of the Pittsburgh shooting. (Naiya Ross | Daily Trojan)
In light of the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, Penn. on Saturday, nearly 100 USC community members gathered at the University Religious Center to hold a prayer vigil in honor of the 11 victims Tuesday evening.
“It was devastating. Heartbreaking,” Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni said. “It is very difficult to make sense of such a senseless act, such a heinous hate crime. When it happens in a house of worship while people are praying, it impacts religious communities in, I think, even a deeper way.”
Soni said that because the shooting happened during prayer, it was bound to affect both the religious and nonreligious communities at USC. Soni wrote in an email to the USC community on Monday that anti-Semitism has been on the rise in recent years and that has lead to an increasingly difficult time for the Jewish community on USC’s campus. 
“Our extraordinary religious diversity gives us the privilege and the responsibility to learn and grow with and through each other, while cultivating interfaith relationships and inter-religious experiences that empower us to tell new stories about ourselves and our world,” Soni wrote. 
Interim President Wanda Austin sent an email to the USC community on Tuesday offering condolences to the victims’ families and gratitude for the first responders to the event.
“Events such as these are deeply painful, and at USC, we are so fortunate to have a close-knit and strong interfaith community, one that helps us come together, imagine a kinder world, and ultimately heal,” Austin wrote.
Director of Religious Life Rabbi Dov Wagner emphasized the need for the USC community needs to unite and support others during difficult times like this. 
“What happens on one side of the country or the world affects all of us,” Wagner said. “This was the largest attack on Jews on American soil and we need for students to come together to focus on togetherness and strength.”
During the vigil, University and student leaders gave brief remarks and asked the community to pray for the lives lost in the tragedy. 
After the candle lighting ceremony, attendees were invited to publicly share their feelings donate to charity boxes and fill out mitzvah pledge cards.
“It’s just so heart-wrenching that these people were just doing something that I do in my daily life and were killed because of that,” said co-President of Chabad Avia Cohen. “There is this idea in Judaism based on all of our unfortunate tragic events that a crisis can either break you or it can make you stronger … It is a time for us to … respond to this hate and this darkness with light.”
Student representatives from various organizations, including the Shoah Foundation and Undergraduate Student Government, spoke at the vigil. Representatives from student organizations, including USC Helenes, Interfaith Council and Sigma Alpha Mu, each lit candles in memoriam of each of the victims of the shooting.
Undergraduate Student Government canceled its weekly meeting Tuesday to allow senators to attend the vigil. 
Eddie Mack, a sophomore majoring in international relations and a member of Interfaith Council, attended the vigil to show support for the Jewish community. 
“In order to fight bigotry and ignorance, it has to be a communal effort that extends across all sorts of religious and ethnic lines,” Mack said.
Last week, Chabad @ USC hosted Shabbat 1,000, an event that gathered over 1,100 students to celebrate the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest. This week, the organization is encouraging students to attend Show Up to Shabbat — a series of services on Friday and Saturday to honor the lost lives in Pittsburgh.
“It is important to be a part of a community on campus. I would suggest that they come to either Hillel or Chabad,” Soni said. “For all students, what I’ve found in times of national tragedy like this is that … in the immediate aftermath of such a tragedy, the best resource are other students. Our best resources are each other.”
Soni also encouraged students who are having trouble processing the events of this past weekend to come to the Office of Religious Life, where students can be connected to pastoral care and spiritual counseling, among other resources. 
“It’s horrifying to think that in today’s day and age, we still face such kinds of acts, such hatred that attacks people for no other reason than because of who they are,” Wagner said. “But we can’t fight darkness with a broom or with a stick, you fight it by lighting a candle. And when tragic events like this take place, we need to add more light, more love.”

How a deteriorating housing complex is being repurposed to provide housing for homeless veterans and their families
Just down the street from USC Village and steps away from a recently constructed student housing complex — at the intersection of Hoover Street and Adams Boulevard — several deteriorating buildings are relatively inconspicuous. 
Wooden boards block empty windows and a metal fence prevents anyone from entering the facility, where broken furniture pieces lie scattered across an untrimmed lawn. But underneath years of neglect, the buildings’ unassuming facade hides over a century of history, even as they catch the attention of developers looking to build housing in the rapidly changing neighborhood.
The story of development around USC is a familiar one — new construction, rising rents and an exodus of longtime residents who are either evicted or priced out.
But at the Casa de Rosas Campus, a site that has been abandoned for nearly a decade, the picture looks different. In the coming months, it will be converted into housing for homeless veterans and their families as part of a growing effort to serve the city’s homeless population even as University Park becomes increasingly unaffordable. 
“I see absolutely no conceivable downside to this,” said Jean Frost, vice president for preservation at the West Adams Heritage Association, a nonprofit organization that advocates for the preservation of historic sites north of USC. “What is not positive in housing people who have served this country, have children and at one point in their lives have been homeless?”  
The redevelopment project, which aims to begin construction early next year, will provide affordable housing and restore a piece of Los Angeles history that had been left to decay. 
Ward Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization focused on improving Los Angeles through affordable housing and community service, is leading the project. Preservation organizations and affordable housing advocates both support the redevelopment — a rare collaboration between two typically opposing interests.
“It’s a really excellent step,” Frost said. “You’re restoring a very significant historic building in this neighborhood.”
A storied past
The Casa de Rosas Campus was built in 1893 as one of L.A.’s first private kindergartens, at a time when education for younger children was a relatively new concept. 
As public kindergartens were introduced in the city, the need for private institutions diminished, and the campus became a college preparatory school for women, one of two in Los Angeles at the time. 
As West Adams transformed in the 1920s, the Girl’s Collegiate School lost its appeal. Wealthier individuals moved westward and homes began to be redeveloped into apartments. 
In 1925, the school moved to San Gabriel Valley, and the campus stood vacant until the end of World War II.
In 1950, Essie Binkley West, known as the “Angel of Skid Row,” purchased the Casa de Rosas Campus and converted it into a shelter for homeless women, renamed the “Sunshine Mission.”  
During this time, a historic preservation firm restored individual sections of the Casa de Rosas Campus, but the buildings fell into disrepair when the nonprofit organization running the campus dissolved due to lack of funding in the late 2000s. 
The facility was transferred among city departments before the Housing Community Investment Department of Los Angeles finally began plans for redevelopment in 2015.
Teresa Grimes knows the site’s history better than almost anyone else; she entered the Casa de Rosas Campus onto the National Register of Historic Places, a federal database of sites with intrinsic historical value including the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty.
“I’m really excited the project is finally going to get off the ground,” Grimes said. “It really is one of the more historically and architecturally significant buildings not just in the USC area, but in Los Angeles. The fact that it survived this long is pretty remarkable.”
As the principle architectural historian for GPA Consulting, Grimes is currently working to maintain the campus’ original architectural style throughout the development process.
“Our role in the project is to make sure that the project is designed and implemented in the most sensitive way possible,” Grimes said. “The standards are intended to manage change, not to prevent change.”
Physical alterations from the original state will be kept minimal to preserve the Casa de Rosas Campus’ historic value. 
Thomas C. Michali, an architect who has restored the Casa de Rosas Campus since it was the Sunshine Mission, was chosen to lead the designs for the current redevelopment of the campus. The current plans include rearranging some hallways and rooms and repurposing larger rooms as assembly spaces. 
“The changes will all be very positive. The conditions are pretty poor now,” Grimes said.
Developing the community
When it began plans to redevelop Casa de Rosas in 2015, HCID chose Ward EDC — an independent affiliate of the Ward African Methodist Episcopal Church — as one of the main developers, along with green engineering firm The Integral Group. With a social mission grounded in its religious connections, Ward EDC works to improve the greater Los Angeles area by following the church’s foundational values.
“We are a community development organization, not a housing development organization,” said Ward EDC President Jacqueline Dupont-Walker. “We don’t have to keep develop[ment] teams ready just to find any deal to keep them busy … If we can help support some of the economic infrastructure in this community, then that’s a win-win for everybody.” 
Ward EDC performed a “ground blessing” on the Casa de Rosas Campus before starting development plans, with pastors from the AME Church as well as Los Angeles City Councilman Curren Price and U.S. Rep. Karen Bass. 
Price, a member of the City Housing Committee, has pushed for the city to fund 10 affordable housing projects, including the Casa de Rosas Campus.
USC is aware of the project, and Ward EDC has been in “informal conversation” with Theda Douglas, a senior vice president at USC, about what the University can offer the redevelopment. 
The Los Angeles Veterans Collaborative, a veteran-service centered network of government agencies and organizations administered by the USC Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, has also worked with Ward EDC to plan how the facility will be used.
Dupont-Walker said the Casa de Rosas Campus did not face resistance from local residents, but that other Ward EDC projects have encountered opposition. The Ward Villas for seniors, an apartment complex for the elderly located just 500 feet from the Casa de Rosas Campus, received pushback in favor of faculty housing during its construction, Dupont-Walker said.
“Most people don’t want affordable housing in their neighborhood,” Dupont-Walker said. “‘Not in my backyard’ — that was a marketing phrase that was real.” 
Ed Cabrera, a public affairs officer with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, said that residents often object to permanent affordable housing entering their neighborhoods due to misinformation. 
“You have people think with affordable housing comes crime or that folks aren’t deserving to live in the neighborhood,” Cabrera said.  “But all the research we’ve seen and funded on the topic shows that’s not the case. New affordable housing often becomes a way a neighborhood transforms for the better.”
The decision to develop the Casa de Rosas Campus received support from affordable housing advocates, according to Brent Gaisford, the director of Abundant Housing L.A., a group that aims to lower rents and develop housing sustainability across Los Angeles.
“We’ve got a lot more people who want to live here than there is room,” Gaisford said. “In general, we need a lot more housing in the city, particularly affordable housing. The places we can get that and help get people into housing is a good thing.”
A home for veterans
Once completed, the Casa de Rosas Campus’ 37 units will host single-parent homeless veterans who make less than 60 percent of the Area Median Income, which was less than $41,580 in 2018, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The focus on veterans was intentional, Dupont-Walker said, as almost 4,000 homeless veterans currently live in Los Angeles County, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.
“There is no community for that population in the city of Los Angeles,” Dupont-Walker said. “They have a very big challenge … They’re trying to stabilize their lives in a way that they can get back on track or get on track for the first time.” 
The renovation of the Casa de Rosas Campus will feature multiple veteran-specific components for its occupants.
“They need a quiet room, no explanations needed, where they can go and de-escalate and defuse, and still know their kids are okay,” Dupont-Walker said. “They need to have a place where they gather at a time that the other voices are telling them strange things, whether it’s a flashback from combat days or a mental illness.” 
The new home will also have teams available to counsel veterans and guide them into new careers. While providing care for any children, services within the campus prioritize assisting homeless veterans in reintegrating into “mainstream society.”
The affordable housing project intends to provide a temporary home for homeless veterans as they transition into a more stable lifestyle. 
“Unlike the current trend in permanent supportive housing, we’re coming at it when it’s needed at a window in time,” Dupont-Walker said. “We want to help plan for what happens as they prepare to move.” 
Despite these goals, the redevelopment project has faced ongoing delays. HCID listings show the estimated start date as July 8 of this year, but Dupont-Walker said it has lagged due to the multiple approvals required for every advancement by the City Council or the mayor.
As the Casa de Rosas Campus remains vacant, awaiting its revival as housing for homeless veterans, organizers like Frost are stuck in limbo — frustrated, but hopeful. Frost anticipates that once the campus houses underserved people for the second time in its history, it will come to life again, with its unhinged roof tiles straightened and boarded windows replaced to allow in the California sunlight.
“It’s a building that really deserves to be restored,” Frost said. “It finally has a plan that will see it to last another hundred years.”
