A common tradition in Latin America is the celebration of Dia de Los Muertos, a time to remember loved ones who have passed. It is believed that during this time, “La Muerte’’ roams the streets and visits the homes of the souls it has lifted in recent times.
With the World Cup less than a month away from starting, I wanted to take a moment to remember those who, due to injury, lost their chance of playing in a World Cup. 
The most recent and perhaps most notable injury is that of Portuguese forward Diogo Jota, who suffered a calf injury late into stoppage time last weekend. Jota started the match for Liverpool in their weekend matchup against current Premier League Champions, Manchester City. The 25-year-old was taken off the pitch and is believed to miss the World Cup due to a tear in his calf. It is hard to speculate a return from these injuries as the recovery rate is pretty quick, but the re-injury rate is high — complicating a prompt return to the pitch. 
Argentina is also seeing their chances of a World Cup title shrink as Paulo Dybala will miss Qatar and Angel Di Maria is considered questionable. The two attackers who play in the Italian Serie A for Juventus and Roma have experienced serious injuries that threaten their return to the field of play. While Di Maria’s prognosis after a low-grade injury to the hamstring is a return after 20 days, Dybala runs with less luck, as an injury to his left quadricep will leave him off the field for, at most, six weeks. At 28 years old, this is also Dybala’s last chance at a World Cup during his prime. 
Another prominent absence will be that of French midfielder N’Golo Kante as he is facing a hamstring injury, leaving him out for four months. In his time at Chelsea, Kante has scored 12 goals in the Premier League and contributed with 16 assists between Premier League and Champions League activity. His instrumental role in the French national team will be missed in Qatar. 
Mexican fans still worry about who their striker will be ahead of the first match against Poland. El Tri is full of uncertainties after Jesus Manuel “El Tecatito” Corona’s fracture to his ankle and ligament injury during a training session with Sevilla back in August. Gerardo Martino’s team has also struggled to gain their striker’s full potential as Raul Jimenez continues to fight the horrors of the injury list. After his cranial injury with David Luis, the Wolverhampton striker has not been his usual killer self. Now, another injury is keeping him on the brink of missing the World Cup; a groin injury. However, Jimenez continues in rehabilitation with the Mexican National Team medical staff in hopes of returning for Qatar.  
The last few weeks prior to the World Cup tend to be a danger for soccer players, as any minor injury can keep them off of the team plane with only days remaining before departing. Take Mexican defender Nestor Araujo for example, who missed the 2018 World Cup due to an injury which occurred in a friendly against Croatia only a few weeks prior to the start of the tournament, or Mexican midfielder Luis Montes, who in 2014, lost his chance for a World Cup run after an ankle fracture kept him off the roster only two weeks before the start of the Brazil World Cup. 
We can only wait and see what these nations will be able to do despite the important absences they have suffered. It will be our job to remember these fallen players and imagine what it would have been like with them on the pitch. For the players listed above, there is not much more to do than join us in watching from home.

What does it take to build an iOS app with some 1,500 daily users from the ground up? Three very tired undergrads — and maybe some software know-how.
Meet Mist, one of the latest apps founded by a team of USC students. It’s a social media platform where users leave geo-tagged posts that are usually compliments for strangers on campus, and other users can then comment or direct message the author of that post.
Posters advertising the app appear regularly on campus, and many have probably walked by Adam Novak — a senior majoring in computer science and one of the app’s co-founders — holding a cardboard affirmation sign on the corner of Childs Way and Watt Way.
Originally, the founders intended for Mist to be a dating app, but that quickly changed after its launch.
“An overwhelming response that we received was that that’s actually not what USC students want — they don’t want another dating app,” said Kevin Sun, app co-founder and a senior majoring in computer science. “[They said] ‘We want a place where we can anonymously say kind things about other people and just make peoples’ days.’”
Since launching in late September, Mist has accumulated upwards of 650 total posts and 2,100 direct messages. The app is reminiscent of @usc.missedconnections, a popular campus Instagram account that posts screenshots of compliments similar to those on Mist, usually erring more on the romantic side.
Novak said the Instagram account was one of a few sources of inspiration for the app, and that the team at Mist wanted to build off of the “missed connections” concept with the geo-tagging, direct messaging and search features. When asked over Instagram, the missed connections account moderator said they hadn’t heard of the app before.
Posts on Mist — dubbed “Mists” — range from: “In case no one has told you today, you are an amazing person with a beautiful smile” to “i was minding my business walking up the stairs and saw the fattest roach” to “is 5.5in too small, too big, or just right?” to “swimmer girls hmu, i am a very good breaststroker.”
To moderate inappropriate content, Sun said that the team uses an AI algorithm that’s trained to spot hate speech and a Mist’s flag-to-like ratio; there’s also a degree of manual moderation done on the backend by the team members. 
Sun said the vast majority of Mists are “positive,” and that a “really small” number of them have been flagged for hate speech.
“Our strict line is something that’s disrespectful,” Sun said. “[Hate speech] does not have any place on our platform.”
As seen in the aforementioned “breaststroker” comment, though, Mists clearly aren’t always positive compliments for campus strangers.
“It’s tough,” Novak said of content moderation. “It’s not like the post has to necessarily uplift someone to be on the platform, and we do our best with the prompts to push people in the right direction.”
One of the app’s tabs offers new daily prompts for users to write Mists about things like “someone you passed on your way to class” or “someone who makes the world a better place.”
Sun, Novak and junior Sophie Shack — another of the app’s co-founders — each spend some 40 to 50 hours a week running and improving the app; immediately after an interview with the Daily Trojan, all three said they were headed back home for a nap.
“We don’t have any [target] numbers,” Sun said. “If one person posts a nice compliment to somebody else and that other person’s day is made, it was worth it … If it means making people believe that there are actually college students who are kind and not competitive, mission accomplished.”
The three said that they’re happy supporting the existing community of users — with no financial gain and no plans to scale the product — so long as there continues to be a “concentrated set of kind compliments” on the platform.
“We definitely are having discussions about [the future],” Shack said. “But in the end, I think we created something really amazing … We’ve been through a lot together these past couple of weeks and months, but I’m really happy with what we made.”

Simone Jackson first found the soccer field at age four playing for the Orange Butterfly team in the American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO) team. Her athletic potential was apparent in one of her first games, as a relentless scoring spree led to her coach making a rule that she could not pass the halfline for the remainder of the game. This was a mistake no other coach would make, and it was ultimately the catalyst in her joining club soccer at age six. Jackson was born with a fighting spirit and her unstoppable ambition was reinforced by the faith of her family. 
“My family is my why,” Jackson, a sophomore majoring in business administration and cinematic arts, said. She wears the number 80, a jersey number that has been passed down through generations like a family heirloom. The Jackson family name is scattered throughout USC athletics history. Jackson’s grandfather, John Jackson Senior, was the USC offensive coordinator from 1976-81, winning a national championship in 1978.  Jackson’s father, John Jackson Junior, was a part of the Trojan football family as a player and then broadcaster, and her older brother, John Jackson III, is currently a wide receiver in his senior season. 
As student-athletes, the Jackson siblings’ lives are intertwined at USC in more ways than one. 
“I see him in the training room. When he’s recovering, I’m recovering. When he’s working hard, I’m working hard. We push ourselves, and when I have extra food, I’m like ‘Okay, come over,’” Jackson said. 
While a brother-sister dynamic may be a nuisance for some, Jackson sees going to college alongside her brother as “truly a blessing.” 
The newest generation of the Jackson family wearing cardinal and gold is ready to surpass the members who came before them. But despite the stellar athletic accomplishments of her relatives, Jackson is not trapped in the shadows of their success — she is building a legacy of her own.  
Since 2016, Jackson has found success playing on the coveted United States Youth National team. While Jackson earned her spot at a young age, her journey did not come without any challenges. A turning point in her athletic career came after being cut from the national team at age 15, as she was ranked in the bottom two during technical testing.
“I still remember that rejection and feeling and the drive that it pushes you. I know it sounds so funny because I was so young, but that sticks with you and it makes you want to work even harder,” Jackson said. “And now, I can look back and say that I was grateful for it because it reminds you [that] your spot is never your spot. It’s always a privilege to represent your country and to keep working and to never become complacent and always look to get better, one percent every day.”
After this experience, Jackson quickly earned her spot back and is now a member of the U-20 team, and joined the American team in Costa Rica for the World Cup this past summer. 
“It was such a big deal because when you grind for something for so long and you put it on your calendar for so long, and you finally reach that destination. It’s just such a special experience because hard work is really paying off,” Jackson said.
Not only did she make the roster and step onto an international stage, Jackson brought pride to the name she wore on her back by scoring against Japan in the 70th minute.  
“When you score in the World Cup, it just means something different because you can score at home and that’s great, but when you score on a world stage, it means you’re one of the best to ever do it,” Jackson said. 
Embarking on her freshman year at USC, Jackson wasted no time making a name for herself. She started eight games, played in all 20 and contributed with five goals and eight assists. Her sophomore season has consisted of 10 games thus far, in which Jackson has scored five goals, adding two assists. She has proven to be a key player on the team. It’s clear when the Redondo Beach native steps on the field, tides turn in favor of the Trojans. 
“I think three minutes into her coming back from the World Cup, she ripped a shot against TCU, which totally changed the momentum of the game,” said Head Coach Jane Alukonis. “I’ve had teams anywhere from young club teams to college teams. There’s something different about Simone that has just a deep desire to score, to change games.”
But being an admirable athlete is just a fraction of what sets Jackson apart, as her potential is not limited to just her athletic abilities. Jackson knows how to lead others not just with a soccer ball at her feet, but also in student organizations off the pitch. She was the co-founder and co-president of the Black Student Union at her high school, and at USC, she serves as president of the SC Missions Team and member of the United Black Student Athlete Association.
Alukonis said that Jackson is “literally always doing something to better herself.” 
“She’s just one that you never know what she’s going to be up to, but always just trying to contribute, whether it’s volunteer work or something professional, but super interesting person and very driven and professional,” Alukonis said. 
At only 19 years of age, Jackson can now call herself a Nike athlete — a title that is not just a reflection of who she is today, but a testament to the dedication of her younger self. Being a Nike athlete reminds Simone of “that little girl who always put Nike shoes on her Christmas wish-list.” 
 Being a part of the Nike family puts Jackson’s name next to some of the greatest athletes of all time: Serena Williams and Michael Jordan are two of her favorites. 
“I’m blessed and I’m honored,” said Jackson. “Nike reaches so far beyond sports. I genuinely feel like they’re one of the most progressive brands there is to be attached to. I think that this partnership is going to be long lasting, and filled with love.” 
Jackson is not limiting herself to one path. As an athlete, Jackson hopes to play for Angel FC in her professional career. 
“If the game was tied or if we needed kind of like the last dig to come pull us out. She was always the one doing it,” said Alukonis. 
As an entertainer, Jackson’s “dream outside of soccer would be to maybe write, direct and if I can’t be the talent, then I’ll help the talent and get into entertainment law.” 
There are no boundaries in the future accomplishments of Jackson. 
Jackson does not just have dreams, but she has the innate instinct to accomplish them. Next time you read her name it may be in front of the words “lawyer,” “actor,” “director” or “international champion.” Regardless of which path Simone Jackson chooses to pursue, a Trojan legacy will follow.

McCarthy Quad was adorned with Pride flags and tents Thursday as USC’s Pride-Fest returned following a two-year hiatus prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The event featured tents run by students and LGBTQIA+ organizations from around Los Angeles, two areas for taking photos with Pride flags and a rainbow-painted closet door as props and performances from professional and student drag performers.
Shane Dimapanat, a sophomore majoring in journalism and the organizer of Pride Fest, opened the event alongside drag group United Queendom and President Carol Folt. 
Folt emphasized the importance of events like Pride Fest and the hard work that went into it. She acknowledged the progress already made for LGBTQIA+ equality but said that while “we certainly are not where we were 50 years ago, that does not mean we want to be where we are now even five years ahead. This is a moment to continue that push.”
The event featured a gender-affirming clothing swap that gave students the opportunity to donate unneeded clothes and pick up something new. 
Celia Bartel, a senior majoring in political science and public policy and co-director for USC’s Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, said they intended for the clothing swap to help support trans and nonbinary students at USC. Bartel said they hope people came away from the display understanding the diverse ways people can express and explore their gender identity. 
“There is no one way to present one’s gender and you should never assume one’s gender identity based on how they present,” Bartel said. “People have the right to present any way that makes them feel comfortable, we just want to make sure we support them.”
Drag queens took center stage at Pride Fest, with USC students dancing and lip-synching alongside United Queendom.
Ra Oblivion, a sophomore majoring in design, performed in drag at the event and said that she hoped to bring to light a more alternative side of drag on campus.
“I wanted to bring a little bit of both a more avant-garde take to drag and a more alternative take to drag than the mainstream version,” Oblivion said. “I also wanted to present a bit of transness, too.”
Daisy Darling, a sophomore majoring in English literature and East Asian languages and culture, also took to the stage in drag. They said that USC had an incredibly rich drag scene, which they felt lucky to be able to celebrate at Pride Fest.
“A lot of people don’t know that we [USC]  actually have the largest national drag program for any college,” Darling said. “There is a really rich, strong community at USC, and events like this help uplift and showcase our talent. So I’m so grateful as well I got to be a part of it.”
They said community members have another opportunity to see USC drag performers soon: the USC Drag Show will be Jan. 28, and 12 performers will be featured. 
Darling was joined on stage by Willconique, a freshman majoring in theater, who performed live in drag for the first time on Thursday.
“I was invited by Miss Daisy Darling to perform, and I’m very grateful to get to showcase myself and my talent here on my college campus,” Wilconique said. “This was my first time performing live in drag, and that was a milestone for me. I’m grateful to be able to have this opportunity, and it’s thanks to Miss Daisy Darling and it’s thanks to being here at USC in a culture that supports LGBTQ+ students and people.”
The Graduate Student Government, the USC Department of Gender and Sexuality studies and several other organizations all had booths at the event. 
Reach LA, an organization dedicated to uplifting LGBTQIA+ people of color, also had a table. Shyanne Lindsay and Sandy Nguyen, community health specialists for Reach LA, spoke about the various events the organization is planning, such as ‘Prep 4 A Pageant,’ a pageant highlighting trans women of color that will take place on Dec. 11. 
Dimapanat said that the main goal of Pride Fest was to give LGBTQIA+ students a sense of community and belonging.
“The vision for it was creating a safe space where people, especially queer people, [can] come just to enjoy themselves as queer people,” Dimapanat said. “We need to build community here. Oftentimes, it can feel that as a queer person, you’re alone; very desperate. But the thing is, there’s a lot of people like us, so we want to make an event to make that much more clear.”
Dimapanat also noted that showing unity with transgender people was a priority when they planned the event.
“[The event] was mainly about solidarity. That’s why I invited the drag queens over, especially because lately there’s been more attacks on trans people,” he said.  
He emphasized that he wanted to showcase that drag queens were not the dangerous people some Republicans portray them as. “They’re just humans, they’re just people,” he said.

Content warning: This article contains references to struggles with mental health.
Some days, life feels like you’re holding your breath through an endless tunnel, hoping that you can make a fun wish once it ends. You know the tunnel ends at some point, but it just seems to drag on. Before you know it, the sky appears outside your window and you forgot to make a wish. You held your breath for nothing. 
Often, we form rituals to control situations that feel ungovernable. Life is short, but we continue to prepare for things that might not even happen. But, all the times I focused on my breath in the tunnel, I missed out on conversations with my dad in the car. My dad died when I was 14, and now I go through tunnels wishing I had spent more time talking to him rather than making wishes. 
My debilitating ritual involves never asking for help without it sounding like an apology and never fully expressing my thoughts in fear of making things worse by opening my mouth. This is also a fun result of learned helplessness — after going through the same situation repeatedly, you learn to stop trying to fight it and give in, even though logically there is a possibility for change. This was especially true in growing up with my mom.
My mom emigrated from Vietnam when she was in her late 20s, and after living through the Vietnam War and its aftermath, I don’t think she ever turned off her survival mode; she bottles up her emotions and expects others to do the same, more than anyone I know. 
She wanted a perfect, A-student, religious Catholic daughter that would never talk back, and one that would get a high-paying job to take care of the family and her when she got older. A daughter that would never dye her hair or get tattoos because somehow that was equivalent to promiscuity. I was that for a time being because the fear of possibly losing my mother somehow or upsetting her overwhelmed me, and that sentiment continuously repeated as I grew older and the yelling became hitting when I made a mistake. 
I know my mom never wanted to hurt me. It was just the only way she knew how to love. It wasn’t all bad; she also paired this with love by making homecooked meals nearly every single day of my life and bringing me cold plates of my favorite fruit. 
Her love was shown in her strictness, and while her lack of empathy hurt me, how could I blame or hate her when no one offered her any empathy growing up? How can I resent her when she gave up her dreams of having a successful restaurant and leaving her family to move to a new country with nothing so I wouldn’t have to go through what she did? How can I possibly bite the hand that fed me, provided me shelter, gave me life? How do I cope with the fact that it was that hand that hurt me the most? 
That painful paradox results in silence — glass-shattering, suffocating silence. So while I was miserable, I continued to abide by her wishes to avoid hurting her and to avoid any more bruises appearing on my body — until my senior year of high school when the bomb I created by bottling everything up exploded.
While my mom has seen me cry, I always sucked those tears back in before I got the “Why are you crying? Would you like a real reason to cry?” This time, I couldn’t control the tears or my emotions. I can’t remember what exactly happened, but it was something about her finding out I had a boyfriend and not understanding my depression that was the breaking point for me.
I explained that I knew she needed help when I was younger as both her and my dad worked endless hours to pay the handful of bills we had. I knew she needed a strong daughter to carry the weight my dad left after he died. But I needed a mom who would just let me cry and hold me and tell me things would be okay. I needed a mom who could understand that emotional vulnerability isn’t a weakness, and that closing yourself off from your emotions doesn’t make you strong. 
I told her how much I was hurting, how some days I wish I didn’t exist, how I spent years just trying to survive living in that house and never learned how just to live life. I told her how I never wanted to keep secrets from her but I had to because I could never be the perfect daughter she wanted, and while there’s always room for self-improvement, constantly expecting more from yourself leads to self-hatred. 
For once, the words simply could not stop leaving my mouth. After what felt like an eternity, I finally took a breath of air, and my eyes cleared up a bit to find tears flowing down my mother’s eyes as she told me that everything she does is out of love, and if I felt this way, she failed as a mother, and I should just kill her to ease both our pain.
The world stopped, or maybe part of me died at that moment. I already lost my dad, and now I was losing her too.
It was not until I left home for a college about 300 miles away that I realized I lost my mom a long time ago — just as she lost her idea of a perfect daughter the moment I was born. I can never be what she wants me to be, nor can she be the warm, comforting, understanding mom I want her to be. So, in the process of learning how to grieve my dad, I’m learning how to grieve for my mom, too — the mom that never existed. 
Tears flood my eyes as I imagine what would happen if my mom were to possibly read this. The likelihood of it is slim to none, but just the thought of it paralyzes me because while I desperately want her to understand, I know that she won’t and these words will only hurt her. 
I wish things would magically change in my life without me ripping myself apart to make them happen. But I can’t keep making wishes by holding my breath through highway tunnels or sacrificing parts of myself for others to change. Life is too short, and I want to live it for once. So, as much as it hurts and I don’t want to, I’m going to leave the things left unsaid alone. I mean, wrecking myself trying to say them wasn’t doing me any good anyway.

What’s “in” these days seems to be constantly in flux thanks to the lovely development of micro-trends. They are certain pieces that are fashion kryptonite because they sell incredibly well, so much so that everyone buys one, posts in one (can never post in it again, more on that later) — then it is exhausted. The problem with these pieces is that from a marketing perspective, they do great — huge sales, great social media coverage, good brand traffic. However, from a creative perspective, these pieces poison the industry and the environment.
Micro-trends function to accommodate the huge market. If an authentic design brand creates a piece that goes viral, then plenty of other brands like Shein and Amazon work quickly to recreate the dress. The result: everyone buys it, just for it to become basic.
Strangely, this process does in fact give me some hope. The fact that we do not want to wear clothing after it becomes “too basic” or “overworn” reminds me that we do indeed want originality and unique pieces. However, we realize this too late. Influencers especially don’t have time to wait before they post the most up-to-date must-have items.
Let’s take a step back. Why are we even buying these clothes? Why do certain pieces or styles become “trendy”? And why do we even care about trends that die within months anyways?
We’ve all heard of the 20-year cycle — the notion that every 20 years, fashion trends resurface in a new, “vintage” celebration and echo. But lately, with the popularity of Y2k already faded and tired, I’m led to question whether and why trend cycles are shortening to occur every 10 years. Colorful Y2k is “over” because it got “overdone.” Now, we’re entering a new phase the internet is deeming “indie sleaze,” an echo of early 2010s grunge and Tumblr aesthetics.
What to do then with these new trends? How do we know what is micro and what will last through this trend cycle?
Here’s the thing. The trend cycle itself is not sustainable. Even if you properly avoid micro-trends and focus on pieces that perfectly and correctly fulfill the current trend cycle, you cannot keep up with how long those pieces stay in general style. Few have the money to keep up. And even worse, the planet cannot.
How can we keep up with trends? We can’t. We must unsubscribe.
This shortening trend cycle is dangerous for our environment. According to a study done this year by Frontiers in Environmental Science, “the textile industry generates roughly 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent or nearly 10% of world GHG emissions.” The study also includes this warning: “Due to the growing demand for clothing exacerbated by the proliferation of the fast fashion business model… it is projected that the fashion industry will account for approximately 25% of the world’s carbon budget by 2050 (Ellen Mac Arthur Foundation, 2017).”
We know we need to stop shopping at places like SHEIN, but despite all the research and evidence pointing to how horrible the business of micro-trends is, we are trapped in the consumerist haze.
The rampant consumption this model produces is a dangerous expression of how the Internet has squashed creativity and individuality. Surely we can muster more personal expression than what we’re fed from influencers and the “best sellers” list. Don’t feel like you have to abandon dressing trendy; but the most important, continually valued aspect of fashion is unique pieces.
We all have so much access now, from the internet and even from covid. Now that almost everything is online (even some Fashion Week shows are live-streamed!), we have no excuse but to get out into the world and discover what we truly like. The internet is huge, don’t get lost in the trending page. Eventually, if the trend cycle shortens even more, we’ll find ourselves missing summer trends in the winter of the same year.
The path in pop culture to look towards is Emma Chamberlain. The YouTuber from San Bruno, has become a Vogue Met Gala Host and almost transcended the label of “influencer,” to reach celebrity status. The way she managed this, is her eye and business plan. She started out by simply following trends, embracing color-blocking, ‘80s style and 2000s scrunchies. But now, through her development and, I argue, proper use of her position, Chamberlain has infiltrated companies like Louis Vuitton and Vogue to elevate her style and access to the fashion industry. She no longer follows trends, she is close enough to designers to set them.
We can’t all be that close to designers, but we can all choose to rise above the low-hanging-irresponsibly-made-fruit of micro-trends.

For Yerchanig Sara Chakmakian, her Bachelor of Fine Arts exhibition is a direct reflection of her identity, passion for coil building and connection to an ethereal feminine energy. The “Divine Portals” exhibit, showcased in the Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery from Oct. 5 to 19, featured six vessels inspired by the female form in various ocean-inspired hues. 
The show gave Chakmakian, a senior majoring in design, a chance to meditate on internal musings of culture and spirituality. The daughter of a Mexican mother and Armenian father, Chakmakian uses her artistry to keep the vibrant history of her heritage alive through her craft.
“I come from a mixed background, and we’re already so removed from our cultures because of genocide and displacement,” Chakmakian said. “Even though a lot of the history has been erased, art is a way for me to preserve my culture.”
Before crafting her BFA exhibition, Chakmakian constructed her senior thesis around coil pottery and how the medium serves as a “portal” between ancient techniques and contemporary life. 
“Coil building is such a primal thing,” Chakmakian said. “Ceramics was the first synthetic material humans ever created, and they did it to survive. At first, it was in the home to store water and cook, but now ceramics is a huge industry. Even as a contemporary artist, I’m still working with the coil method.” 
Roski Chair of 3D Design Alexis Zoto worked with Chakmakian to strengthen her thesis.
“We talked a lot about this idea that, when you’re making, you’re aware that what you’re doing has been done for millennia in every part of the globe,” Zoto said. 
Chakmakian’s research led her to stories of indigenous societies that paid respects to water goddesses, and the strength of these celestial, feminine deities reminded her of her own upbringing and the importance of the women in her family.
“The indigenous societies believed that we came from these primordial waters, and that all life sources came from water,” Chakmakian said. “I think it just came intuitively to make the female form. It’s a direct result of my aunts and my mom and my grandma instilling that culture in me, and so I was really inspired by the divine energy.” 
After having her gallery approved in late April 2022, Chakmakian worked tirelessly to craft an immersive, thoughtful exhibit. Thomas Mueller, who chairs 3D Art at Roski, noted that the opportunity for Chakmakian to have the entire gallery to herself is rare for undergraduate students.
“Not every student gets to do a show like this, and typically students will only get half of that gallery,” Mueller said. “It’s a lot of work. She was willing to embrace the risk, and I watched her really navigate it and rise to the challenge and put on this incredible show.” 
During the 27-week-long process of crafting her pieces, Chakmakian’s missteps became blessings in disguise. At first, she wanted to customize wooden pedestals for her pieces, but steep lumber prices led her to look elsewhere. She settled on cinder blocks stacked on top of one another, adding contrast to her polished, curved ceramics.
“I wanted to make them look like they were floating in space, so I like how the cinder blocks are see-through in those little peek-a-boo windows. I also like that the squares are reminiscent of the really sharp color blocks in the back,” Chakmakian said. “It’s this interesting balance between feminine and masculine energy with the shapes.” 
Chakmakian believes that due to her design background, her ability to think on her feet made the exhibit more personal and cohesive.
“[The cinder blocks’ symbolism] wasn’t intentional, but I think a lot of times you have this idea in your head and you put it in the gallery and all these conceptual things start kind of coming to life, whether you anticipated for that or not,” Chakmakian said. 
“Every class she’s had or every project she’s had, she always takes a risk,” Mueller said. “I’ve really seen her grow, not just in her skills, but in the way she thinks about art and really embracing ideas outside of our comfort zone and using those ideas to push her unique voice forward.”
Despite the ancient origins of her coil building technique, Chakmakian made sure to keep her exhibit grounded in the 21st century. Adding bright orange and blue color blocks to frame her ceramics (another Plan B that ended up elevating her work) was one of Chakmakian’s finishing touches to “Divine Portals.”
“With our generation, I was thinking about what the exhibit would look like on a phone camera,” Chakmakian said. “People were tagging me in all these photos during my open ceremony, and I loved how each picture was so unique because of the blocks. They looked different in so many pictures because everyone was looking from different angles.” 
“Sara is really a fascinating practitioner because she brings fine art and craft together. There was a really interesting conversation about color theory and activating a space, and how she engaged the space with the color blocking on the walls,” Zoto said. “It’s exemplary. It’s a fine example of the very best that Roski has in terms of combining art and design.”

Primarily seen in print magazines, architectural photography is not the first medium that comes to mind when viewers think about museum galleries, but a new exhibition at USC PAM and its guest curator are seeking to change that narrative. 
The USC Pacific Asia Museum opened “After Modernism: Through the Lens of Wayne Thom” Oct. 14. The exhibition is curated by Emily Bills, a leading scholar of Wayne Thom’s work and author of “Wayne Thom: Photographing the Late Modern.”
In 2015, the university acquired Thom’s collection of over 250,000 works as a part of USC Libraries Special Collections. In his over 50-year career, Thom became a prominent architectural photographer, capturing over 2,600 structures across the Western United States, Hawaii and Southeast Asia. 
His practice largely revolved around Los Angeles and surrounding areas in Southern California and focused on Late Modernist buildings, exemplified by accentuated minimalism, novel materials and dynamic forms.
Early in his career, Thom was commissioned to photograph buildings on USC’s campus, including the William L. Pereira & Associates’ Vivian Hall and Edward Durell Stone’s Center for International and Public Affairs. Included in this PAM showing, these two pieces demonstrate Thom’s emphasis on linear structures and visible contrasts, qualities integral to many Late Modernist architectural designs.
Thom himself did not adhere to a specific style; instead he approached each project with a unique perspective and appreciation for the space around the design and the architectural firm’s initial vision. He often went to great lengths in pursuit of the perfect angle from which to capture these various buildings. 
“I use a helicopter to illustrate these portraits. I call it a portrait of the building, and also indicate the location, the neighborhood, the context, and relationships to other buildings,” Thom said. 
One specific project the exhibition spotlights is Thom’s work regarding the CNA Park Place Tower in Los Angeles. This building was the first in L.A. to utilize mirror glass skin, an innovative technique originally developed in the 1960s. 
“It’s a non-existent building. It’s supposed to merge into the sky and only reflect what’s in front of it.  The building is merely a frame of the reflection, which is the subject and that was very, very exciting to me,” Thom said. 
For this 1971 photograph, Thom won his first award, the PPG Architectural Photographer Invitational. 
The show also included a digital interactive component, titled “Wayne Thom 50/50.” This section of the exhibit includes what Thom personally views as the most important projects of his career. Located in the last room of the show on a touchscreen, “Wayne Thom 50/50” offers viewers the chance to interact directly with his archive and explore for themselves.
The exhibition is a triumph for architectural photography as an art form, a medium whose aesthetic value is often overlooked. 
“At this point, we, of course, think of photography as an art, but we don’t necessarily think of architectural photography as an art. We think of it more as sort of a professional branch of architecture itself,” Bills said. “But architectural photographers are artists. They have a subjective perspective on the building and how it should be presented. And so, to be able to see his photographs blown up and beautifully printed and exhibited, I think, can bring attention to the discipline itself.”
Similarly, the exhibit was constructed out of a desire to expose viewers to the timely issue of preservation facing the buildings Thom photographed in the late 20th century. 
“We’re also aware that many of these buildings that he photographed — of which a lot of them are canonical, spectacular buildings — but particularly those from the ‘70s and ‘80s, at this stage are really either in need of conservation, or they’re threatened with demolition,” Bills said. “So we were hoping that the exhibition could also bring awareness and support to help save this architectural heritage and bring attention to buildings from that time period.”
“After Modernism: Through the Lens of Wayne Thom” is on view until January 22, 2023.

Every student is familiar with the midterm season cycle: Find a spot at Leavey Library, open your laptop, shuffle your favorite lo-fi playlist, grind and repeat the next day. 
But what happens when you finally burn out on chill lo-fi beats? Well, I have the perfect recommendations for you! From one nerd to another — let me help you maximize your study session with these quintessential video game soundtracks.
“Celeste”
“Celeste” is not a game for the weak, challenging the player with unforgiving difficulty. With its high demand for precision to succeed, “Celeste” is certainly no joke — and neither is its soundtrack.
Originally released in 2018, Celeste is a 2-D side-scrolling game that tells the tale of Madeline and her expedition to scale Celeste Mountain. Throughout the game, she learns to overcome debilitating through her determination to reach the summit. The music of “Celeste” ties straight into both Madeline’s internal and external journeys, resulting in a pulsating, electronic tracklist.
Lena Raine, the soundtrack’s creator, hypnotizes the player through the use of Native Instruments’ Massive synth. Each song’s smooth ambiance washes over the listener, moving forward in perpetual motion, almost as if Raine breathed a heartbeat into the synths. “Resurrections” mesmerizes with its chromatic scales, while “Quiet and Falling” and “Exhale” take a step back, unifying piano and strings with the initial electronic sound. Furthermore, “Checking In” resembles a lo-fi track thanks to its oscillating synth and chill bassline. Though not every song on the “Celeste” tracklist is fit for studying (i.e. “Anxiety”), many of the songs will leave you relaxed and primed to churn out an impressive paper.
“Genshin Impact”
Whatever your opinion on “Genshin Impact” may be, one thing is undeniable: the beauty of its music. 
“Genshin Impact” is an open-world gacha role-playing game launched by the Chinese company Hoyoverse in September 2020, and follows the journey of a traveler in search of his lost sister. Along the way, the Traveler explores numerous unfamiliar lands based on real-world locations such as Germany, China, Japan and the Middle East, with each area exponentially growing in both complexity and difficulty.
As you traverse the game’s meticulously designed open world of Teyvat, there is almost always a lovely orchestral melody serenading you in your endeavors. From region to region, the tunes differ, fitting the vibe of each area. For example, Inazuma, the area inspired by Japan, is paired with gorgeous, traditional music utilizing instruments such as the shamisen, shakuhachi and taiko to capture a folk-inspired sound. Songs like “Streets of Elegance” and “Flickering Sakura” are both regionally fitting as well as excellent study songs thanks to their calming vibes. “A New Day with Hope” and “Pure Sky” employ a piano and full-string orchestra to bring the listener a sense of serenity, also making them a fitting addition to your study playlist.  
“OneShot”
Certainly one of the more obscure titles on this list, “OneShot” is a 2-D indie adventure game that follows the story of a young cat-child called Niko who is tasked with reilluminating a world plunged into darkness by delivering the sun, an Edison bulb, to its rightful position. The game has stellar art, incredible world design, thought-provoking writing and, of course, breathtaking music.
Casey Gu, more commonly known as Nightmargin, composed the atmospheric score of “OneShot,” which boasts just over 80,000 monthly listeners on Spotify. Employing the use of FL Studio, a digital audio workstation, Nightmargin favored electronic-based sounds to encapsulate feelings of melancholy and distance. Tracks like “My Burden Is Light” and “Children of the Ruins” exude a mysterious yet comforting vibe, while “On Little Cat Feet” flaunts a groove that’s sure to get your head bopping. The soundtrack of “OneShot” is definitely a hidden gem that I promise you’ll enjoy while completing your research papers and 200 page readings.
“Stardew Valley”
Everyone’s favorite farming simulator! If you’ve played the game, you may be surprised to see “Stardew Valley” on this list. Something about the sharp, western twang of the banjo that supports many of the games’ tracks doesn’t exactly scream “chill study sesh.” However, if you think that’s all the game’s music has to offer, you would be sorely mistaken.
In addition to developing the game almost entirely independently, Eric Barone also took it upon himself to compose the game’s music. Though its music is known for its country and western inspiration, there are also numerous tracks in the game that provide a gentle melody for studying. The game’s winter tracks such as “Winter (Nocturne of Ice),” “Winter (The Wind Can Be Still)” and “Winter (Ancient)” are characterized by lazy synths, while “Fall (Raven’s Descent)” and “Fall (The Smell of Mushroom)” utilize the sound of woodwinds to capture the laid-back aura of autumn, making each song an ideal alternative to lo-fi.
“Minecraft”
I know you were waiting for this one. What game music article would this be without including the nostalgic behemoth that is the “Minecraft” soundtrack? I personally remember laying on the floor of my living room at age eight, PlayStation controller in hand, binging “Minecraft” for hours on end as its ambient music echoed through my home. Almost everyone that grew up playing games in the 2000s has played “Minecraft,” truly making its melodies the soundtrack of our childhoods — heck, even my mom still listens to “Minecraft” music!
Composed by Daniel Rosenfeld, mononymously known as C418, the original music of “Minecraft” was released in the albums “Minecraft – Volume Alpha” and “Minecraft – Volume Beta,” which contain some of the most recognizable game tracks ever. “Sweden,” a melancholy tune composed of a piano and full-string orchestra, strikes a bittersweet sense into the heart of every listener. In contrast, “Haggstrom” is an enchanting, playful melody thanks to its unique instrumentation. No matter which “Minecraft” song you’re listening to, the soothing nature of the soundtrack’s composition makes it the perfect background noise for a productive study period (or a cathartic cry sesh).
