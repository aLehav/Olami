The Trojans’ deadly passing attack has been lauded all season, thanks to the versatility of junior wide receiver Jordan Addison and the dynamic play of sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams, whose poise and accuracy has led the Trojans to a 3-0 record with an offense averaging over 50 points per game. 
However, a truly great offense has a reliable run game that forces the defense to pack the box, opening up more downfield space for the likes of Addison, sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams and other Trojan wideouts to get open and advance the ball downfield. 
In graduate student Travis Dye and senior Austin Jones, USC has found their rushing identity and thrived under these explosive running backs. 
In Saturday’s win over Fresno State, the duo each rushed for over 100 yards and got involved in the Trojan passing attack. Riley employed his tenured running backs evenly, with Jones carrying the ball 12 times to Dye’s 11 rushes. The backs posted eerily similar averages: 9.3 yards per carry for Jones and 9.2 for Dye. To further their mirrored performances, both Jones and Dye scored touchdowns on Saturday. 
Head coach Lincoln Riley, who is known for his influence on the quarterback position, praised his offense for their effectiveness on the ground and stressed the importance of having a solid rushing attack. 
“I thought our run game was really pretty good most of the night,” Riley said. “I thought the [offensive] line was really good in the run game. [Jones and Dye] started seeing it pretty well… You have to run the ball to win and win consistently and win in different ways.” 
One might think that having two backs as talented as Jones and Dye could lead to tension between the two athletes as they compete for reps. However, Jones described his relationship with Dye as close and complementary. 
“[Dye and I] have a great chemistry. That’s one of my guys, I love Travis,” Jones said. “We feed off each other… you can just see within the game.” 
Dye gave a similar answer, saying that when Jones performs well it motivates him to do the same. 
“He’s a great back… it doesn’t mean that we have to be competitors,” Dye said. “If he does good, it just makes me want to… do better too. I see it as a great relationship.”
Jones, who transferred from Stanford University last spring, is averaging 3.2 more yards per carry than his freshman season in Palo Alto. With 3 touchdowns in the first 3 games of the season, Jones is on track to break his personal best of 9 touchdowns, which he accomplished in his sophomore year. Jones attributes his strong start with the Trojans to his versatile playing style. 
“I think I fit in the offense pretty well,” Jones said. “Coach Lincoln… he puts the best person in the best position to make plays, and I feel like I’ve shown that I can catch the ball, run between the tackles and, when I need to, pass protect as well, so I just feel like every single game I get to develop my skills and just keep working.”
Jones’ commitment to the USC offense was perhaps most evident when, on a 9-yard run to the end zone, a Fresno State defender ripped his helmet off. While the play was immediately ruled over, Jones kept moving forward through the Bulldog defense into the end zone. 
“I knew it was going to be a flag, and I know they’re going to stop me there, I was sick, but I was like, ‘I’m going to score just in case,’” Jones said. “I saw the zone man, I’m gonna get in the zone regardless, helmet or no helmet.” 
In perhaps an effort to reward Jones for his ferocity, Riley called a draw play on the following play and, once again, Jones found his way into the end zone. 
Jones wasn’t the only Trojan running back to show his toughness on Saturday. On the drive following Jones’ score, Dye scored on a 25-yard run, breaking not one, not two, but five tackles on his way to the end zone. The Oregon transfer completed his highlight play with a spin move as he powered his way for six points. 
“I had some blockers in front of me and I just kept my legs moving… and I ended up in the end zone,” Dye said. 
Dye, who led the Pac-12 in all-purpose yards last season, also praised his offensive line, citing them as a big reason behind his and Jones’ success. 
“They are wonderful. All glory to them. All those yards, those were them,” the Oregon transfer said. “They took that running game, and they put it on their back and they allowed us to run through those holes.”

Welcome back to “Heat Check.” As the playoffs creep closer and closer, many division titles have been seized and stress is mounting for squads on the postseason bubble. Let’s check in with those clubs, as well as some other major news.
There it is. Year in and year out, the Los Angeles Dodgers dominate not only the National League West, but the rest of the league, with the same ringing true in 2022. L.A. clinched their ninth division title in the past 10 seasons with a win over Arizona on Sept. 13. The Mets, meanwhile, rode starting pitcher Max Scherzer to a 7-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday night, grabbing an October seat for the first time since 2016. While the NL East title remains in reach for Atlanta, New York has at least guaranteed a spot in the Wild Card.
Houston became the first American League ballclub to clinch their division, securing the AL West title for the fifth time in the past six years following a win over Tampa Bay on Monday night. Despite the Yankees relying heavily on the juggernaut Aaron Judge, for the majority of the second half, their magic number for a playoff spot stands at two games, with the AL East title likely going down to the wire. The AL Central stands as the murkiest division, with Cleveland holding a slight lead over Chicago. With the White Sox mounting a 12-6 record in September as of the 21st, they very well could cement themselves as the division winner heading into the postseason.
At 81-66 as of Sept. 21, Seattle tightly holds an AL Wild Card spot, owning a five-game lead over Baltimore with 15 games left to play. If they reach the postseason, it would end the longest playoff drought in the four major American leagues, since their last appearance in 2001. For reference, Mariners star rookie Julio Rodriguez was less than a year old the last time Seattle even sniffed the postseason. According to Fangraphs, they stand a 99.13% chance at making the playoffs. Knowing Seattle, I’m sure they’ll make it as stressful as possible.
On the other side of the coin, 11 teams have been eliminated from playoff contention, with Washington the first to fall way back on Aug. 25. Most of these clubs are not strangers to early October elimination, at least in recent times. Kansas City, Detroit and Pittsburgh have all failed to reach the postseason in the past five years. In their defense, the tank seems to be working so far, with all three primed to contend a couple years from now.
The Angels became the most recent squad to be cut from contention, setting their playoff ineptitude in stone with a loss to the Mariners on Monday night. Despite boasting quite possibly the two best players in the world, Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani, L.A. can’t quite get their game together. I get it, L.A. It must be hard putting together a .500 team when you only have billions to spend, hold two generational talents and live in a premier market. Maybe you could take a note from your brother across the freeway, who has — shocker — been a force in the league for the past decade. Maybe a sale of the team is just what this club needs to become at least mildly competent for the sake of Trout and Ohtani. A man can dream.
In other major news, the Joint Competition Committee and MLB have agreed to a new set of rules to be implemented starting in 2023. A pitch clock, limit on defensive shifts and larger bases will become the standard in 2023 and beyond. The rules were aimed at improving pace of play across the league, and considering their success in the Minor Leagues, it should be a solution to MLB’s rather lengthy average gametime.
I personally am in favor of these rules, as I am confident that it will make the game more action packed and fast-paced, which is something MLB has been missing for the last decade or so. However, the biggest miss for me in the agreement between the two parties is the failure to install a robotic strike zone. Umpires have and will always be subject to human error and mental tendencies such as anchoring bias. Despite MLB knowing this for years, they have once again failed to improve the sport it claims to uphold faithfully. I, for one, will cry tears of joy when I no longer have to hear Angel Hernandez’s name. I pray it will only be a matter of time.
Thanks for checking in on my coverage of MLB as we near the end of the regular season. In my next column, the postseason will have started, and the fun will have finally begun.

For a film titled “Don’t Worry Darling,” there seems to be a lot of worries for those involved (and plenty of “worry” jokes to go with it, like this one). Directed by Olivia Wilde, “Don’t Worry Darling” has been the subject of intense controversy, mostly regarding the alleged tensions between cast and crew. Perhaps this notion of behind-the-scenes drama alludes to the plot of the film where what’s going on behind the scenes may be darker than one realizes. 
The story of a young suburban housewife Alice (Florence Pugh), “Don’t Worry Darling” follows her as she realizes her idyllic bliss is the product of ominous secrets. At the beginning of the film, viewers are introduced to Alice and her husband Jack (Harry Styles). They live in Victory, an exclusive community modeled after the 1950s. When Jack goes off to work, Alice stays home and does house chores, and occasionally hangs out with her friend, Bunny (Olivia Wilde), by the poolside. Everything seems peaceful here: a perfect vacation, except this is life. 
The women are given almost everything they want – but are cautioned not to venture outside the boundaries of the community and into the desert. These rules are set by Frank, the architect (Chris Pine), who essentially rules over the community along with his beautiful wife, Shelley (Gemma Chan). 
Alice always lived by the rules. That was until her former friend, Margaret (Kiki Layne), broke the most important one: she ventured into the desert. As Alice witnesses the community’s attempts to suppress Margaret, Alice begins noticing that something is amiss in the neighborhood. Jack refuses to tell her what exactly his job is, and Alice begins experiencing frightening visions and occurrences. These all contribute to Alice’s pressing need to figure out exactly what’s going on that the women don’t know about. 
Even if it feels like a riff on “The Stepford Wives” (1975), which it has been compared to, the concept of “Don’t Worry Darling” is wholly immersive. “Don’t Worry Darling” is a master of atmospheric creation. The pastel colors, the 1950s vibes, the Palm Springs setting and the literally forbidding desert — all of it is a cinematographic work of art. 
Many scenes in the film are designed to elicit a visceral sense of suffocation, such as the moment when Alice literally wraps her head in saran wrap and later when the wall closes in on her, smushing her face against the glass. The scene is not only evocative but well-incorporated. 
However, by the end of the film, the origins of these incidents aren’t clearly answered. Nonetheless, these scenes have left their impact on the viewer, especially in rendering Alice’s growing sense of paranoia about her surroundings. 
The story is a case where more exposition earlier on would have paid off immensely. While the viewer is introduced to the loving relationship between Jack and Alice early on, there is seemingly no mention of why staying in Victory and working for the Victory Project is so important to Jack. Put simply, the stakes of leaving are unclear. Given that he appears to love and care for Alice so deeply, Jack’s insistence on staying in Victory feels confusing and almost uncharacteristic.
Throughout the beginning half of “Don’t Worry Darling,” viewers only get the perspective of Alice and Jack as they exist in their current lives for the Victory Project. Their past lives are unknown until much later. While this does lend some degree of mystery to the story, it also presents many questions that conflict with the plot’s unraveling. How did Jack and Alice find themselves in the Victory Project? Why is the Victory Project so significant? 
There’s also perhaps the most pressing question of the entire film, the one that Alice is attempting to find out: what exactly are the men doing in Victory headquarters?
Even by the end of “Don’t Worry Darling,” the answer to the third question remains unclear. 
In fact, it’s relatively unanswered. The film focuses all its attention on promoting the disintegration of Victory. With the filmmakers expanding so much upon the logistics of the residents’ arrival, the central mystery of Victory headquarters seems to slip from their minds. The background of Victory is intriguing — there’s no doubt about that. However, many character motivations end up either dismissed or lumped together.
Along those lines, many of the husbands and wives living in Victory are characters that offer room for exploration, but lack nuance until the very end. This aligns with the film’s main issue: the first half of the story has Alice gradually discovering what’s wrong with the community, while the second half is Alice trying to overturn it. Sure, each plot point is well-structured and engaging in a dramatic manner. Character dimensionality, though, particularly that of Bunny and Shelley, comes too late and is rather inconsistent with what viewers have already seen. 
Florence Pugh is absolutely radiant in her role as the loving wife Alice and, needless to say, she’s the heart of the film. Although Harry Styles offers his own skills to the role of conflicted husband Jack, Pugh shows audiences why Alice is the main character. Her transition from content housewife to a woman desperately looking for answers is (unsurprisingly) well-done. Pugh’s performance raises the film’s rating by at least half a point, if not more. 
In addition to the questions raised by the plot, there are also questions about the story’s themes. What sacrifices will we make to achieve this illusion of happiness? Is progress really just a vision of the past? Most importantly, what is love? 
“Don’t Worry Darling” sets up many conflicts and spends a lot of time building them in the story, leaving little time to fully flesh anything out. A lesser amount would have made all the difference.

With debuts from brands like Mirror Palais and accessories like Coach’s leather sling messenger bags, this year’s New York Fashion Week has been nothing short of exciting. I can only dream of owning runway pieces from Dion Lee, Luar and Brandon Maxwell. But the week’s true standout show that gave me everything I could ever want and more was LaQuan Smith’s Spring 2023 collection.
The collection was nothing short of spectacular. Staying true to his brand, his clothes ranged from sheer oranges to sequined purples to Barbie pinks. The cuts of his garments — still featuring an ultra-cropped cut — toed the fine line between active nudity and ultimate Mia Goth-red lipstick stain-boyshort lacy underwear sexiness. The shorter the skirts and the closer to a nip-slip the better, and there were absolutely no cover-ups under the sheer blouses and dresses. 
But what truly caught my attention was Smith’s play with metal and hardware pieces. While he did incorporate metal breastplates into the sleek black dresses in a fashion similar to Gabriela Hearst and Schiaparelli, his penultimate look was absolutely breathtaking: Frida Aasen, a face very familiar from Smith’s shows, wore mini metal angel wings as her bra-top and a simple black midi skirt with silver hardware draping at the waist. 
Immediately, my inner Miranda Priestly began to wonder which pieces from his collection would trickle down into the world of fast fashion – we’ve already seen the cropped fur-lined jackets and daring bodysuit cuts. But, considering that a lot of runway pieces are simply that – runway and not necessarily ready-to-wear – would I even feel comfortable or, rather, confident enough to wear the angel wing bra and hardware-draped midi skirt that blew me away?
Probably not, especially due to the fear that I would be called a slut or a whore or accused of seeking attention. This topic is extremely sensitive and frustrating among women, especially since we don’t get dressed with the intent to be a “slut” – we just want to look good, and what we look good in is whatever we’re feeling at that moment. 
Simultaneously, different body types result in differing reactions; a larger-breasted woman might be called an attention whore for wearing the same top as a woman who is an A-cup. And, of course, there is the constant frustration that our wardrobe is pinpointed as disturbing and distracting while our male counterparts are often never reprimanded. 
All of this can be traced to the traditional role of women. A woman is historically treated as an accessory to men – like a surprise pair of extra shoes in your Polly Pocket set. Often being identified in association with her male counterpart by taking on nicknames like Mrs. [his name], it is then her role to be dutiful to her husband. With that, she is only to be the object of desire of one sole man, not the public, and people’s romantic or sexual attraction must therefore be decided by her and her actions. So, when she dresses provocatively or suggestively, apparently, she’s doing exactly that – suggesting her status, availability, etc. – and straying away from her role as a good wife and/or a good, respectable woman. 
So, when we wear things like see-through dresses and breastplates in public, we are deemed sluts in the most negative, evil definition of the term. The public has an opinion that is set forth by a majority and standards set by human history – the history of countries, of cultures and of the human evolution from animal to ‘man.’ We have progressed enough to build such fortunes of cities and governments and with this comes an expectation of everything that we invented or evolved with, such as the active presence of full-coverage clothing. This is why we don’t expect animals to dress daily unless for the pleasure and/or sport of humans’ entertainment.
But in fashion, we emphasize personality, art and history. There is a desire to look at things from a different perspective – consistently new, fresh and original – whether this means the complete opposite of human’s adoption of garments with total nudity or scratching the surface and playing with things like fabrics, hemlines and structures or commenting on human suffering and indulgence through performance art. 
Does this mean, then, that there can never be a peaceful amalgamation of the both sides? Will one have to give in more than the other? It is, indeed, confusing because of how much influence and intersection exists between the regular world and fashion. If there is a strong desire to come together more in a judgment-free and progressive relationship with expression and clothing, who must ensure there is fairness in a seamless blending? It’s difficult to even fathom a win-win situation since the ability to grow comes with the ability to have opinions – something I love to have. People will continue to think what they want and whether or not it changes is not up to their environment or habits, but simply and solely up to them. We must continue to remind ourselves that growing up is about being able to determine your own decisions AND feel confident in them. 
I’m still figuring that out, but for right now, I find a lot of comfort knowing that at least LaQuan Smith doesn’t think I’m a slut.

USC Sol Price School of Public Policy alumnus Tomio Daumit began his nonprofit Rapid Reforest in January with an ambitious goal: planting one billion trees by 2030. The technological idea behind this objective? Creating drones capable of planting trees — and lots of them.
Six months into the pandemic, Daumit reassessed what he wanted to put his time and effort into. He decided he wouldn’t get back into corporate America, and instead wanted to “do something for the planet.” Inspired by soil’s carbon capture potential, which he learned about from the Woody Harrelson documentary, “Kiss the Ground” (2020),  Daumit began toying with the idea of using the efficient technology of drones to reforest land.
“I thought [the documentary] was really cool, and there were some things in there about composting and all these other things and my brain started twirling,” said Daumit, who, after pursuing an undergraduate degree in graphic design, worked toward a masters in urban planning at USC, but hasn’t yet finished his degree. “I wanted to get into climate change and get something going.”
When Daumit figured out that he could plant trees using drones, his idea for Rapid Reforest was set. 
Rapid Reforest drones are equipped with 3D printed attachments that spit seeds into the ground, which vary based on the ecosystem and climate of the targeted replanting site. The team reviews drone-conducted terrain mapping of the land to be reforested and plans for the kinds of trees, shrubs and bushes that fit the region. 
The organization targets areas deforested from limber clearings and other commercial uses, and those impacted by wildfires.
“The thing about wildfires is that those areas are accustomed to having trees in the ecosystems or have been torched from them,” Daumit said. “It’s easier for us to go back in and replant where there’s already been forests, rather than go and try to replant in places that did have forests, but a long time ago, but are now used for different things.”
About 900 trees have been planted so far in the Los Angeles area using Daumit’s small drone and paintball guns — as, sometimes, the seeds being planted are similar in size to paintballs. The team planted fenced areas by hand, Daumit said, by throwing handfuls of seeds into yards and along highways. 
The nonprofit is currently focusing on replanting areas in western California, Oregon and Washington, as all three regions share commonalities in climate and wildfire impacts. Daumit also reached out to some former professors of his in Brazil, where he did part of his postgraduate studies, to begin planning reforestation efforts there — specifically in the Atlantic Forest.
Matthew Marshall, Daumit’s partner, remembered the somewhat chaotic state their place was in during the drones’ development stage, when Daumit and Marshall tested various planting methods and mechanisms.
“We had all of the tests for the pods that would be coming from the drone — they were just everywhere. There [were] little dirt balls throughout the entire place, and the balcony was full of different testing pods to try planting these,” Marshall said with a laugh. “It really took over the house.”
Marshall and Daumit used to ski and snowboard together often and noticed that the slopes in their area started to shut down due to a lack of snow, which sparked their interest in sustainability and the ways nonprofit work can serve an environmental cause. 
“I think that’s really when this started taking hold and — no pun intended — snowball,” Marshall said.
Daumit said Rapid Reforest’s goal to mitigate the impacts of climbing carbon emissions through increasing forest cover is one side to the “Swiss army knife” of combating climate change.
“Reforestation is not the only solution,” Daumit said. “There are so many different things or people coming up with different technologies and this and that, but what we can do — the cheapest right now — is planting trees because it’s not hard.”
Anna Micci, a friend and supporter of Daumit’s, said over the many years she’s known him, Daumit was always an advocate for addressing climate change and incorporating sustainability into day-to-day life: Micci recalled that he had advised her on a home solar project some time ago.
“[For Daumit], it was always about not how to make money, but how can we help?” Micci said. “How can we make it better? What are you guys doing on your behalf and what are you doing in your own house to make it better to live green and be sustainable?”
Rapid Reforest is raising funds through a GoFundMe page to upgrade to larger, more productive drones. The goal currently stands at $15,000, with $3,950 already raised. The team has also applied for several grants to support their work, a process that Daumit was new to.
The nonprofit also houses an educational aspect: Daumit has been developing ideas for sustainability education with his sister-in-law, a teacher working in Atlanta. One of the grants the organization applied for would fund the creation of boxes stuffed with information and materials to make the seed pods in an aim to teach children about climate change and tree replanting.
Daumit, who had worked at startups before starting Rapid Reforest — including an organization that tracked medical equipment in hospitals using Bluetooth technology — said getting help with nonprofit work has been comparably easier. 
“One thing I learned [is at] a nonprofit, people are much more willing to talk to you and help you and give you money, rather than a normal startup,” Daumit said.
Sabine Keiser, who met Daumit when they were neighbors a few years ago, said his defining characteristics are his selflessness and kindheartedness. 
“It’s all about giving and not demanding to have something in return,” Keiser said. “[Daumit] is someone who inspires people.”

Following the disaffiliation of eight fraternities to form the University Park Interfraternity Council, two more fraternities, Phi Sigma Kappa and Phi Delta Theta, have joined the UPIFC while maintaining their membership in the USC Interfraternity Council.
The fraternities are listed as members on both the UPIFC and IFC websites. It is unclear how the two fraternities are able to maintain membership in the USC IFC while also being members of the new UPIFC, as the UPIFC touts itself as a “coalition of fraternities previously affiliated with the University of Southern California.” 
The UPIFC declined the Daily Trojan’s request for comment on the fraternities’ simultaneous membership in both councils and instead referred the question to the USC IFC. The USC IFC did not respond to inquiries on the matter. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan Tuesday, Phi Delta Theta leadership confirmed that as of August, “the California Delta Chapter of Phi Delta Theta elected to join the UPIFC while maintaining its membership in the USC IFC.” 
“This decision was made to facilitate an ongoing dialogue with USC that we hope shapes and fosters an environment promoting collaboration and reasonable accountability,” Phi Delta Theta wrote in its statement.
Phi Sigma Kappa did not respond to the Daily Trojan’s request for comment.
As members of both the UPIFC and USC IFC, Phi Sigma Kappa and Phi Delta Theta will be expected to abide by the policies of both interfraternity councils, which includes the ban on first semester freshmen rush. This was reflected in the UPIFC’s rush sign-up form, which mentioned both Phi Sigma Kappa and Phi Delta Theta’s “partial affiliation” with the University, indicating that “freshmen were not allowed to participate in recruitment nor become a new member” of these chapters for the Fall 2022 semester. 
“By making this decision, we will both experience the benefits of a recognized student organization and continue to be subject to standard University rules while following regulations set by the new UPIFC,” Phi Delta Theta wrote in its statement.
Though not officially listed as members of the UPIFC, Delta Tau Delta and Kappa Sigma were also on the UPIFC’s rush sign-up sheet. The UPIFC rush sign-up form listed them as partially affiliated with the University. Both fraternities did not respond for comment when asked about their affiliation status. 
Phi Delta Theta wrote that through its decision to join the UPIFC while maintaining membership in the USC IFC, its goal is to “maintain a sense of unity and to allow continued communication amongst organizations on ‘The Row.’”

A national survey of 1,790 college students was conducted over the summer on behalf of the American College Health Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, finding that while 85% of surveyed students were vaccinated with at least one dose — an even higher proportion than the general American population — attitudes on the coronavirus and other vaccinations remain deeply divided. Vaccine mandates and awareness of college student health centers strongly correlated with higher vaccine uptake, but Republican and conservative students were less likely to be vaccinated than their liberal and progressive peers.
Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman, a co-chair of ACHA’s Campus COVID-19 Vaccination and Mitigation (CoVAC) Initiative Advisory Committee, said in a briefing on Wednesday with the Daily Trojan that the politicization of vaccines remains “challenging” for public health.
“Some of the strategies that we know can work are really individual, one-on-one conversations that are in a non-confrontational way,” Van Orman said on encouraging unvaccinated students to get vaccinated. “We know that finding people who might be aligned with that person — [who] might be from the same community, from the same political orientation, who are close to them … hearing the message from what we think of as a trusted messenger is really the only way to move those individuals.”
The survey’s results are, by nature, not comprehensively representative of the USC population. For example, the survey was unable to provide sufficient analysis for respondents of ethnic or racial backgrounds — for example, of Asian descent — which were not statistically significant; meanwhile, the USC Office of Institutional Research says 19% of the student population is Asian. Van Orman said that the Trojan Pandemic Research Initiative, which focused on the USC population, revealed “extremely high vaccination rates” of 98% for  students, staff, and faculty, as well as a generally greater willingness to adhere to relevant policies. 
“We saw people that [said], ‘Well, maybe the policies are annoying me, and I don’t like the things we have to do, but I believe I’m protected,’” Van Orman said. “With our students, faculty and staff, [there was] this sense of, ‘We’re in it together. We’re doing this for our community.’”
Van Orman expressed concern that the politicization of vaccines may “spill over into other life-saving vaccines.” A working paper published in July by the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that university vaccine mandates in fall 2021 — measures which were politically controversial — “saved approximately 7,300 lives, reducing deaths from COVID-19 by about 5%.” 
“As public health [workers], as individuals — we have to depoliticize vaccination,” Van Orman said. “We have to depoliticize public health.”
A total of 139 coronavirus cases, including self-reported positive tests and tests taken at Student Health, were reported for the week of Sept. 11 — a 37% decrease from the 219 cases reported the week before. Van Orman said trends at the University remain consistent with those of Los Angeles County.
Updated influenza vaccines and bivalent coronavirus boosters were both made available beginning Sept. 12, administered via walk-ups at the Engemann Center or by appointment. Student Health will also hold flu vaccination events at the weekly Trojan Farmers Market, beginning next Wednesday and ending Nov. 9.
Van Orman said she encourages students to receive both vaccines at once, noting that doing so would save time and that side effects after vaccination, while variable, are generally not additive.
“We call it the ‘twin jab,’ and I think it’s a convenient way for people to just get them all done,” Van Orman said. “People do sometimes feel mild flu-like symptoms after vaccination; that’s normal, that’s your normal immune response … If you get in both at once, the response is still good, and then you can minimize the number of days you might be feeling some of those vaccine side effects.”
Van Orman said that while data collected so far on reception of either vaccine is limited, an estimated 500 influenza vaccines were administered last week, and   Student Health aims to administer 1,000 this week. Exact reports will begin in early October. 
Student Health will also host an inaugural Sex Week Oct. 17-23, an initiative sponsored by the Graduate and Undergraduate Student Governments, as well as Women and Youth Supporting Each Other, aiming to promote sexual and reproductive health on campus. Van Orman said that while many events have yet to be added to the calendar, they will center on providing medical information including sexually transmitted infection testing and contraception — or sex-positive topics including positive, healthy sexuality and communication in relationships.

The Queen of England died, I got an A on my pop quiz and the third highlight of my last week was — I’m just joking. Am I though? Let’s talk about it. 
If you happen to have eyes or ears, you probably witnessed the commotion that was Queen Elizabeth’s death. Black Twitter pulled through per usual and was full of comedic content devoid of any sympathy or pity. Among the best were videos of people hearing “the Queen died” and going through a slew of options wondering which of the queens died. “Beyoncé? Tracie Ellis Ross? Michelle Obama? Whitney Houston been dead. Oprah? Queen Latifah? No? What queen died then!” Upon hearing it was the Queen of England who had passed, I think renowned orator Stephen A. Smith captured the Black community’s sentiments best, “I’m here to tell you right now…we don’t care. *insert laugh* We don’t care.”
It’s an interesting thing being a Black person in the midst of white mourning. When we think of the Queen, and especially the Royal Family, there is no sense of endearment attached to the thought. In fact, it’s why many people took to Twitter and other platforms to point out the racist history that paints the monarchy. The history and influence attached with the Royal Family is actually painful to many minority groups and countries, not the wonderful picture white culture wants to make it out to be. The British monarchy was built on colonialism and the oppression of a great number of countries. Queen Elizabeth’s wealth and influence “persisted entirely because of colonialism.” 
So what exactly were we supposed to mourn? This distant lady from the U.K. that has done nothing but be an active member of an atrocious organization, which only grew to become increasingly irrelevant as time went on and imperialism became less popular? 
Even forgetting history for a moment, Meghan Markle anyone? The racism doesn’t even go that far back. Meghan Markle left the Royal Family because of the racist treatment she underwent. Remember during her interview with Oprah when they said the Royal Family worried about how dark the baby would be? Which, OK, I had to laugh, because my girl Meghan is as light as a Black person can get and mixed with the leprechaun? Yeah, that is definitely not something you all need to be worried about, but thanks for expressing your concern because now we know you all are still racist!
If we are being real, nothing of significance changed once the Queen passed because her entire brand is an expired way of life — sorry, not sorry. Our day-to-day lives were not going to change when she passed like it did with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death and Roe v. Wade being overturned. Apart from day-to-day lives, it’s also just a matter of respect. To put it in the nicest way possible, Black people and other minority groups laugh and feel no sympathy because she didn’t represent anything positive to us. 
In fact, I wondered why people all the way in the United States were posting about her death, as if it had anything to do with them. Was there some sense of obligation to pay your respects to this woman because of her title? As Black people, we are even more detached from her passing. 
When we lost icons like Aretha Franklin, Kobe Bryant, Chadwick Boseman, Cicely Tyson, Nipsey Hussle, Virgil Abloh and recently, Bill Russell, we didn’t laugh. We grieved. These were members of society that truly did make a difference and positively changed lives, whether it be through their legacy, their work or another form of greatness. Like Dr. Shola Mos-Shogbamimu stated in a tweet, “Nobody owes the Queen a right to mourn her. Grief has to be earned.” 
While white culture may appraise her as an iconic, reverent, royal entity — a symbol, her symbolic meaning is not universal. Take Thomas Jefferson on the $2 bill for example. He symbolizes various meanings to different people. The Black community often sees a slave owner and rapist, while white people often see one of the founding fathers of their great land and the third President of the United States (and teaches and enforces as such in our primary education). In the same way, Black people do not see the symbol that is Queen Elizabeth the way white people do.
So as far as I’m concerned, I didn’t lose a queen. We as Black people, Brown people and special guest appearance, the Irish, didn’t lose a queen. If anything, we gained a bonding experience and a good laugh. We don’t wish her death, but we certainly don’t mourn it. And, it revealed how everyone can be so split on a single person’s meaning not just to them, but as to how they should be known in the history books. 
On that note, my “Queen Elizabeth has died” buy one, get one half off keychains sale is still running on my store website and you can head on over to — joking again!

Elections in the United States are a big deal, especially presidential elections. Americans take pride in their right to vote, wearing their “I Voted” stickers like badges of honor as they exit the polls. This high level of patriotism is long standing in the U.S., but recently, American citizens have been less than proud of their country as voter turnout among American youth is on a downward trend. It seems the pride associated with voting has not been passed on to Gen-Z. 
As shown in Hamilton College’s  “Political Attitudes of Young Americans”  survey, “most young Americans believe that they and their peers would participate more in politics if candidates spoke to the issues that concerned them and if more attention was paid to politics in the schools.” 
Young voters have the power to make a difference, and research shows that despite the ideas that 18-24 year olds do not follow or are uninterested in the political world, many are politically interested but feel alienated by older politicians and their campaigns. It is clear that politicians need to address this in order to engage the younger generation, but it is wishful thinking to expect young people’s attention when we are failing to address their concerns. 
Gen-Z and the rising Gen-Alpha are the future of society and will be most affected in the long term by the decisions our political leaders make in the present. It is evident that we as a society need to reinforce the importance of voting and stress just how essential the voices of the youth are.
In the last presidential election in 2020, voter turnout as a whole increased 7% from the previous election in 2016. However, as stated by the U.S. Census Bureau, voter turnout was highest among individuals aged 65 to 74 at 76%, while the lowest percentage was among those ages 18 to 24 at 51.4% in 2020. According to New York Times writer Alexandria Symonds, there are three general patterns observed by political scientists that may be the reason for this large voting gap: habit formation, opportunity cost and alternative participation.
The first — habit formation — describes the fact that young people vote less because they haven’t had the chance to reinforce this habit. Eric Plutzer, a political scientist at Penn State University says  that with time the tide will turn. We just have to let nature and peer pressure run its course. 
Opportunity costs — obstacles such as strict work schedules, financial restrictions and a lack of time to truly research political candidates —  is a systemic issue that must be changed, both on the university level and through the general education system. The process of voting is not thoroughly taught in school, and without the guidance of a parent or guardian, much of America’s youth falls victim to the difficult learning curve. 
Finally, alternative participation has shown that it is not a lack of interest or ignorance that is causing low voter turnout in Gen-Z. As we look closer at Gen-Z’s political involvement, research has shown that 76% of the younger generation express an interest in elections, 74% care who is president, 85% have interest in public affairs and 83% intend to vote. Furthermore, according to the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, young potential voters are using “other forms of citizen activism, such as mass protests, occupy movements and increased use of social media as a new platform of political engagement.”
It’s not that we don’t care about politics and voting, it’s just that most of the time that information isn’t accessible. 
To keep students aware of upcoming elections and encourage them to vote, USC and universities across the country need to do more to promote and ease the process of voting for their students. Currently, most of the information on politics at USC is from clubs and campus organizations such as the Trojan Democrats and the USC GOP that primarily reach students who are already members of the club, thus not reaching the majority of students.  
To engage more students, the University could offer resources to educate students on the process of voting, send updates about upcoming elections over email, provide transportation to the nearest polls on election day and automatically register eligible students to vote. All of these examples would ease the process of voting and make diving into the political world as a young adult less intimidating and more attainable. 
It’s not just presidential elections though. Universities need to emphasize the impact of voting in smaller and more local elections, not just the presidential election. These less wide-scale elections regarding Congress, the Supreme Court, electing state governors, city mayors, district representatives, etc., all hold an important value and contribute to American politics as a whole. 
Voting does not have to be such a burdensome task, and as citizens of the U.S., we need to demand an easier and more accessible process from our individual communities as well as the government. Speaking of which, the last day to register to vote for the Nov. 8 California General Election is Oct. 24. So go sign up and vote!
