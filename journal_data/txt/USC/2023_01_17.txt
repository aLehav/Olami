Everything was stacked against USC going into their Sunday game against their fierce rival in the No. 2-ranked Stanford Cardinal. The Trojans were nearly 16-point underdogs, they had lost 14 straight games to Stanford and, to top it all off, they were missing their leading scorer in graduate forward Kadi Sissoko for the fourth straight game. But none of that mattered to graduate guard Destiny Littleton and the rest of the Trojans as they handled business by shutting Stanford down on offense and winning by a score of 55-46.
“Especially in the fourth quarter I had a flashback to [the UCLA game], and I didn’t want that to be the outcome. And throughout the game I knew this was going to be a possession game. I knew, just because we jumped out on them in the first quarter, the game wasn’t over,” said Littleton in a postgame interview.”We had to come with not an ordinary effort, and I think we did that.”
The Trojans took the lead 14 seconds into the game and never looked back. They dominated the first quarter, holding Stanford to a measly four points, and forced six turnovers to go along with eight missed shots in what would set the tone for the rest of the game. Junior guard Kayla Williams helped set that tone, marking Stanford from full-court and never allowing them to settle in at any point during the game.
But as halftime approached, Stanford was closing in on the USC lead. With just over a minute left in the first half, the Trojans were seemingly limping to the break as they missed 12 of their 14 field goal attempts in the second quarter, and Stanford was able to tie the game at 19. But a clutch 3-pointer by redshirt freshman guard Taylor Bigby and then a buzzer-beating layup by Littleton pushed the Trojans’ lead back up to 5 going into the break. Stanford would never get the game closer than two points after that.
“We never wavered in who we wanted to be, we weren’t perfect the whole time, but we stayed with our mentality, and I think that was incredible,” said Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb after the win. “You need a special effort to beat the number two team in the country, we couldn’t just show up ordinary. We made a great version of ourselves and that’s what we were.”
One of the keys to the Trojans maintaining their lead was their ability to light it up from three-point range. They shot 42% from behind the arc, well above their season average of 33%. USC started the second half by making three of the first four shots from downtown, but no three was bigger than the final shot of the third quarter. With time dwindling down, Williams hit a deep buzzer-beating three that brought Galen to their feet to push the Trojans’ lead to 10 to end the third.
USC continued to make Stanford uncomfortable, forcing 14 turnovers and keeping a team that was 12th in the nation in terms of field goal percentage to only 31% from the field. The Trojans would close the last eight minutes and 47 seconds without scoring a field goal, but it didn’t matter as USC held Stanford to only five made baskets in the fourth quarter. 
Littleton’s confident playstyle led the way for USC, as she had the most points in the game with 18. It seemed as if whenever the Trojans needed a clutch basket, she was there to deliver it for them, helping USC pull off their first win against a top-two team since 2008.
“I understand the game a little bit more, and [Gottlieb] trusted me to do a lot and just having that connection, like okay, we’re on a run or they’re on a run, let’s get a good possession here,” Littleton said. “I think we all believed in what we could be and now we’re finally seeing the benefits of it.”
The loss ended the Cardinal’s 39-game winning streak against the Pac-12, with their last loss happening in 2021. Stanford’s 46 points were the least amount of points they’ve scored in a game in seven years, when they scored 36 against UCLA in 2017. Going into the game, Stanford was the 10th-highest scoring team in the nation, averaging 82.5 points per game. The Cardinal scored just over half of that against USC’s defense.
At the end of the game, Gottlieb addressed the crowd of fans whose team has not made the NCAA tournament since 2014. She told them how proud she was of the team and then said what everyone in the crowd was thinking, “we are building something special.” 
The Trojans now have four straight away games and next see action when they take on Washington State at 7 p.m. on Friday.

“THE PARADE WILL GO ON RAIN OR SHINE,” the website declared. “Come and be a part of history.” 
And so it did: The 38th Annual Kingdom Day Parade, hosted by the Congress of Racial Equality of California, was held Monday morning at West Martin Luther King Jr. and Crenshaw Boulevards. 
The event, hailed by the CORE-CA website as “America’s biggest birthday celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King,” honors the pastor and civil rights activist who, in his life, frequently visited USC and its surrounding area — including in 1964, when he spoke to an audience of 15,000 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
This year’s parade was the first since 2020 to be held on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, after having been canceled or delayed in previous years because of the coronavirus pandemic. It was also the first time in 10 years that USC participated in the festivities.
Despite forecasts of rain clouding the morning of the parade, festivities carried on as planned. Adrian Dove, executive producer of the parade’s broadcast on ABC7 and CEO of the Kingdom Day Parade, said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that he wasn’t going to let the weather ruin this opportunity to honor the late King. 
“Dr. King said that water is a blessing from heaven — we have a shortage of water right now,” Dove said. “He said that even if fire hoses are turned against us, we figure out a way to keep on keeping on.” 
This year’s theme was “Making America The Last Best Hope of The World” in reference to a quote from former President Abraham Lincoln. In an interview with the Daily Trojan Monday, Dove said he witnessed King being asked about this quote in 1965 while King was in South Carolina for a voter registration drive.
“[Lincoln] said, ‘America is the last best hope of the world’ … and 100 years later, somebody asked Martin, ‘Was that statement true?’” Dove said. “He said, ‘It can be. We’re going to fight to make America the last best hope of the world.’”
George C. Fatheree III served as the parade’s grand marshal this year. Fatheree led a team of attorneys to return Bruce’s Beach to the descendants of its original owners, Willa and Charles Bruce, almost 100 years after it was seized by the town of Manhattan Beach under racial animus.
The parade featured performances by local equestrian teams, the Los Angeles Unified School District All District High School Honor Band, the Kim Eung Hwa & Korean Dance Company, the Crenshaw Christian Center Drill Team and Drumline and Tommy the Clown, who is credited as the creator of the “krumping” dance style.
Many local dignitaries also participated in the parade, including United States House Representatives Maxine Waters and Sydney Kamlager-Dove, Los Angeles Police Department Chief of Police Michel Moore and Karen Bass, the newly elected Mayor of Los Angeles.
Dignitaries and groups from USC participated in the parade for the first time in 10 years. University President Carol Folt gave a speech at a pre-parade special breakfast. The Trojan Marching Band and the Cardinal Divas — the recently formed USC majorette team that had never previously performed at the parade — both performed for viewers during the parade. Both performances were met with applause and “Fight On” victory signs. 
Alex Delgado, a sophomore studying business administration who plays the tenor saxophone in the Trojan Marching Band, said her participation in this year’s parade felt like a “full-circle” moment. Delgado grew up in South Central and had performed in the same parade when she was in middle school.
“[The parade] means a lot,” Delgado said. “There’s a lot of bands or arts, dance groups from the community performing here, and it’s just really nice to see that celebration.” 
Princess Isis Lang, founder of the Cardinal Divas, said the group’s participation was a “big achievement,” especially having started less than a year ago.
“I’m just so blessed and honored that we get to continue to be in Black spaces and uplift Black spaces, whether we go to a [predominantly white institution] or not,” Lang said.
For all the University’s talk of  diversity, equity and inclusion, Lang said, this was a rare opportunity to finally see it in action.
“Not to toot our own horns or anything, but the Cardinal Divas pushed USC into actually being about the action that they continue to talk about,” Lang said.
Yodi Philipos, acting management for the Divas, said the team currently faces a challenge in the lack of recognition and funding from the University. Philipos, a junior studying environmental studies, said the Divas are entirely self-funded, but a GoFundMe created to help raise money received more than $15,000 in donations at the time of publication.
“The community is just pouring back into us,” Philipos said. 
Lang said it felt “wonderful to really be a part of something fully and have people welcome you with open arms” at the Kingdom Day Parade, alongside other groups that otherwise would not have the opportunity to come together.
“It just felt amazing to have that,” Lang said. “And, hopefully, one day, we can be able to actually be with the [Trojan Marching Band] . . . and be able to do these things together and not separately.”
