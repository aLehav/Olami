Here’s the story: Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) is a princess who lives in Scotland and doesn’t like being a princess. Her mom, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson), wants her to wear tight dresses and enunciate and play her lyre like a good princess, but Merida would rather ride on her horse through the woods and climb mountains and other activities not fit for a princess.
Merida and Elinor talk about fate and change quite a lot, which gets old.  Elinor tells her daughter to accept her fate, but Merida wants to change it. Merida asks a witch (Julie Walters) to change her mother, but when she transforms Elinor into a bear, Merida has to rescue her mother. It seems like the scriptwriters are trying too hard to highlight a motif.
But it’s easy to see why. This is Pixar’s first princess movie, and the studio has gleefully upended the domestic fate always handed to Disney princesses. Brave is designed to confound your expectations: Merida doesn’t do housework or befriend a flock of woodland creatures or sing songs about feeling lonely. She is resilient and mischievous, and for fun she shoots a bow and arrow.
Notably, Merida doesn’t even have a prince. All of the princes contending for her affection are losers: awkward, clumsy and spoiled. Merida has no interest in these guys, and as it turns out, she gets along just fine without them.
As a survey of Scottishness, the movie works only somewhat. The voice cast includes a bevy of recognizable Scottish actors, including Billy Connolly, Craig Ferguson and Robbie Coltrane. And the film flirts with Scottish folklore by featuring will-o’-the-wisps to serve the story’s fate-changing purposes.
In its depiction of the Scottish people, Brave leans on a few stereotypes. Almost all the characters are loud and crass, love drinking and love beating each other up. It’s unclear whether moviegoers in Scotland will be offended or, in the same way that French audiences embraced Ratatouille, they’ll just be in on the joke.
Perhaps the film’s biggest success is its astounding visuals. The Scottish highlands are beautifully portrayed here, with twisting, lichen-covered trees and hills blanketed in fluttering grass. Rivers and lakes in the movie move and shimmer like real water. The world of Brave seems like a real place.
And the people who occupy this world are deftly realized. Clothing rustles on bodies like actual fabric, hair sways and bounces in the air and, more than any other Pixar film, the characters have subtle facial expressions and move through the world with a realistic weight.
Brave is a decent movie that never achieves Pixar-caliber greatness. The problem may be because of its late-game change of management: Brenda Chapman created the story in 2004 and helmed Brave’s production for years but was fired in 2010 and replaced with Mark Andrews.
Chapman’s story poses a question that Andrews’ movie never properly answers. The central problem in Brave is that a mother and a daughter don’t see eye-to-eye, a problem that will have emotional resonance for audiences. But by choosing to resolve that problem with chase scenes and swordfights, Andrews renders the movie’s whole message unintelligible. Brave tells audience members that for a mother and daughter to get along, the mother should metamorphose and they should fight monsters together. And to mothers and daughters in the real world that means nothing.
One side-note: La Luna, the short film preceding Brave, is great. It’s directed by Enrico Casarosa and, if not worth the price of a whole movie ticket, it certainly sweetens the deal.

With The Avengers’ recent milestone as the third-highest grossing film of all time, this summer certainly marks a new era of the history of the comic-book movie. Though DC and Marvel adaptations have always been bred for summer blockbuster success, The Avengers really brings to the forefront that these days, superhero movies can be just as critically successful as they are profitable. With The Amazing Spider-Man, The Dark Knight Rises and several other superhero films coming out, audiences have a lot to look forward to.
No discussion on successful superhero movies can go without mention of Christopher Nolan’s reboot (or rather, resuscitation) of Batman. Batman Begins premiered in 2005 amid a wave of gritty reboots. After Nolan successfully erased a Joel Schumacher-nippled batsuit from the public consciousness, the notion of Peter Parker singing in a nightclub wearing tight jeans in Spider-Man 3 was even more awful in 2007 than it would have been a few years prior.
Then The Dark Knight (2008) proved to be not just an amazing superhero film but also an amazing film, period. Heath Ledger’s posthumous Oscar for his role as the Joker would have been unthinkable in an era where Mr. Freeze was considered a worthwhile adversary. With The Dark Knight, standards changed.
Huge box office receipts and an Oscar victory were bound to get the attention of other studios. Witness the movies that followed: Watchmen, Kick-Ass, Iron Man and of course, The Avengers. More importantly, Jonah Hex, Green Lantern and even the X-Men films — the latter so successful in the earlier 2000s — received poor reviews and lower profits compared to its critically successful counterparts.
If a poorly developed superhero movie won’t bring in as much profit anymore, studios are going to try their best to create something greater than standard popcorn fare, knowing that ultimately it will yield the greatest reward. The Avengers was years in the making out of fear of a huge flop and was dependent on five previous Marvel films to familiarize audiences with its superheroes.
But it appears that the DC and Marvel paths are headed in different trajectories. This is perhaps best illustrated by the differences between the brooding, dramatic method actor Christian Bale and everybody’s favorite quick-tongued playboy with wads of cash playing the same, Robert Downey Jr.
DC’s Batman franchise illustrates that a larger-than-life character like Bruce Wayne needs a tight script and an actor to disappear into the role. Batman movies can really delve into the “grittiness” of the gritty reboot like how Casino Royale could for the James Bond franchise, because its main characters are already so well known to the public.
On the other hand, a non-superhero-versed audience is not as familiar with Iron Man, Captain America or Thor by comparison. So Marvel focused on backstory and also garnering audience empathy. The films revolve more around the superhero’s personalities and are decidedly lighter in tone than Nolan’s franchise. The choice of directors from Joss Whedon to Jon Favreau cements this difference.
Expect the July 3 release of DC’s The Amazing Spider-Man to be quite different than those of the pre-Dark Knight era. Though keeping with the wisecracking nature of Spider-Man from the comics, the film will be much darker in tone than the Sam Raimi films and with a stronger love story at its core. With already positive reviews, there isn’t much holding back Spider-Man from becoming a smash hit.
Not much needs to be said about the next DC movie. The Dark Knight Rises has had so much hype since the end credits of The Dark Knight that the Internet almost broke when advance ticket sales opened.
Probably because of The Avengers’ success, the long-contemplated production of a Justice League movie has come to fruition. The DC film needs to keep each hero’s individuality and larger-than-life presence in mind, take tonal cues from Watchmen and steer clear of the sure-to-fail ideas of the stalled 2007 production, which would have starred Adam Brody as The Flash and Armie Hammer as Batman. However, if Bale and Henry Cavill were to lead the cast, their acting chops could even balance out Ryan Reynolds’ Green Lantern.
A lot is riding on 2013’s The Man of Steel with Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman. Directed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen) and produced by Nolan, there is no doubt that this film will restart the franchise with aplomb. Replacing Kate Bosworth with Amy Adams for the role of Lois Lane already increases the film’s potential, and the inclusion of Russell Crowe, Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane can’t hurt.
The Marvel corner will be rounded out with 2013’s Iron Man 3 and Wolverine, 2014’s Deadpool and X-Men: First Class 2 and 2015’s Captain America 2 and Thor 2, all part of the “second sequence” of films to eventually be capped off by another Avengers flick. Despite the plethora of sequels, Marvel seems to have examined each film’s contribution to the universe and will shift to a bleaker tone in response to the current cinematic climate. For instance, Marvel producer Kevin Feige has taken a cue from their rivals, stating that Iron Man 3 will be “a full-on Tony Stark-centric movie” with a much bleaker tone. Adding Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall to the ensemble cast will certainly boost the dramatic potential of the film.
Now, as for a The Avengers vs. The Justice League film: Just give it time.
Spider-Man is a Marvel property not DC. Thor 2 is slated for November 2013. Captain America 2 is slated for April 2014.

Tilting: the act of attacking imaginary enemies. As Cervantes’ infamous storybook goon once made a whole lot out of nothing in Spain, Johnny Hickman feels it necessary to pick up the Don’s cross and have a go at it. But one cannot inject substance into a lifeless work through a title alone.
So what’s in a name? Tilting by Johnny Hickman by any other name would smell as odious. The name might be trying to say one thing, but Hickman’s album as a whole certainly does not say anything at all.
Where Don Quixote’s insanity turned readers sympathetic and reinforced the character’s likeability, Tilting, with its musical schizophrenia and vapid soul, secures no admiration for Johnny Hickman. It’s mainly because of the obvious low production value of the album, Johnny’s lack of direction and charisma and the many, many musical influences, which cause this record to sound like an amateur collection of other notable artists.
Tilting opens with “Measure of a Man,” which promptly lures you into a false sense of security. The song starts in an intriguing way — lyrically introspective, instrumentally simple. Then the country guitars and slightly twanged vocals come in, cannibalizing any merits the song has. The subsequent addition of honky-tonk violins cement the song as poor karaoke fodder.
It’s with the first track that we also encounter Hickman’s lack of personal artistry. The first track oozes Bob Dylan lyricisms and musical stylings without ever recreating the storytelling magic that Dylan could so easily conjure. Later in the album, Hickman indubitably draws from The Who’s classic rock sound, but not in a tasteful way.
The stylings don’t hint of the singer’s admiration of the esteemed band; instead, Hickman’s use of The Who’s signature vocal and guitar mixes on tracks such as “Dream Along with Me” and the album’s closer “Another Road” demonstrates a lack of originality and talent.
With all the different artistic influences, the album has no clear-cut message or sound to convey, making Tilting a shaky, inconsistent listen.
From country to classic rock to pop-rock, it seems as if Tilting covers all the bases, even if the hodgepodge of genres feels off putting most of the time. If one were to decide in which genre Hickman sounds most comfortable, it would be country.
Now, that’s not saying he excels in this area — almost none of the album is above par, for that matter — but Hickman’s wannabe radio-friendly odes, reminescent of Fountains of Wayne and Oasis, sound dated and even more unimpressive. The trouble is that Hickman simply lacks the special flair that makes his music interesting.
On “Destiny Misspent,” Hickman croons lines like “in these bug-zapping hours before morning” as if he drafted a Shakespearean sonnet. But with overtly simple lyrical storytelling and guitar work, the track sounds more like a mediocre open mic night from a college campus. Seeing how Hickman’s connected to a group that has gone gold (Cracker), it’s difficult to understand his unexciting effort here.
One might think that the moderate success of Cracker would have given Hickman the leverage to finance a quality solo release. That said, Tilting simply sounds low quality.
The poor recording, production and engineering is blatant in songs like “Not Enough.” Here the art really suffers. Hickman’s anti-ode to the U.S. would have been an interesting subversion of country music’s often-stereotypical pro-America themes. Yet, because of the lack of high-quality production, “Not Enough” — and the rest of the album — falls flat.
After everything, can an album really be 100 percent bad? Tilting gets close, but “Whittled Down” deserves a pause for consideration — it’s the only track on the album that has something to boast about. “Whittled” shows off meaning in its strong use of metaphor and the lyrics and instrumentation, though simple, work because of clear, focused musical storytelling. Everything comes together on this track, and it’s probably the only time something feels complete and successful on this album.
After this high note, the album continues its downward spiral. “Papa Johnny’s Arms” is a weird musical number, egotistical and slightly creepy-sounding — if Hickman is trying to be Tom Waits, it isn’t working out for him. One needs some major star power to successfully sing a song about how great they are without sounding arrogant, which isn’t what happens here.
Tilting fails because it tries to tilt in too many directions. It doesn’t help that Hickman doesn’t have the will to balance 12 tracks without the whole album falling into oblivion.
 
wow, you missed this one! …. what a great record ….. thank you Johnny Hickman!

Like Ben Affleck when he tackles the south streets of Boston or Martin Scorcese when he sets his ultra-violent flicks in the gangster areas of New York, the roots of writer-director Sarah Polley are tattooed throughout the indie film Take This Waltz.
Polley’s second feature — after the incredibly successful and moving Alzheimer drama Away From Her — takes place in the Little Portugal section of Toronto, an area filled with such Bohemian people and things that the houses look like they came out of an idolized Woodstock catalogue.
It takes two · Toronto neighbors Daniel (Luke Kirby) and a married Margot (Michelle Williams) battle with their innappropriate feelings for each other, and attempt to not act on them in respect of Margot’s husband. - Photo courtesy of EPK.TV
Polley paints her Toronto as a city of lost souls. Empty streets, empty restaurants, empty pools fill the colorful screen. Even though people gather to celebrate and bask in the other’s company, a feeling of lonlieness still permeates the air.
No wonder poor Margot — played by the illustrious Michelle Williams — can’t seem to crack a sincere smile. Stuck in a Bohemian love triangle with her kind husband, Lou (Seth Rogen), and  handsome neighbor Daniel (Luke Kirby), Margot seemingly zombie walks her way through life, as if waiting for some sort of clue as to what to do next.
When she’s not prancing around Canada rewriting pamphlets for Colonial Times-like villages, Margot sits in front of her computer, while her loveable schlub of a husband researches chicken recipes for his new cookbook in their kitchen.
And even though the two banter and play with each other like best friends, you can’t help but see the disappointment in Margot’s eyes. She wants to feel complete with Lou, yet there’s the obvious look of feeling unfulfilled.
On a plane ride back from the aforementioned Colonial Village trip, Margot sits next to a handsome stranger. Tall, dark, mysterious and handsome, Daniel seems to be everything that Margot’s missing in her own relationship. The sparks are mutual, but the idea of hurting her husband keeps Margot from cheating.
The theme of tension is basically what drives the film: Tension between husband and wife, wife and sexy neighbor, husband and neighbor, wife and herself. And though some audiences might react negatively to this stagnant tension, it turns out that the quiet nature of the film doesn’t hinder its interest factor — it instead increases it.
Too often are films filled with flawed characters who are either punished or celebrated. Take This Waltz, however, is a film that is incredibly content with its discontented characters. What drives them are seemingly universal human experiences, creating a film so real it feels like a documentary.
At the root of the film’s success lies Michelle Williams, an actress so perennially lauded recently that it seems as if she can do no wrong. Her Margot is a quiet force with a face void of make-up and a haircut that seems limp, as if it’s simply given up. Williams’ face somehow manages to convey a dozen emotions at once, and she effortlessly shows off her conflicted feelings with the raising of an eyebrow or a glint in the eye.
The real surprise, however, are the tragic performances by comedic actors Seth Rogen and Sarah Silverman. Silverman plays Margot’s spunky sister-in-law, and her fight with staying sober can claw at your heart.
And though some might want Margot to just hook up with sexy Daniel already, it’s hard not to feel for Lou, played by Rogen with such sweet authenticity that everyone might wish they had a husband like him.
At first glance, it seems unlikely that the hot Daniel would go for the plain Margot. Yet the chemistry between Williams and Kirby is so intense that you can see the steam rising from the screen. Even when the two don’t speak, the tortured and binded looks on their faces explain it all.
Take This Waltz is a lot of things: erotic, tragic, hilarious, puzzling. In fact, it’s a lot like life itself. By revealing the inner turmoil of Margot, Polley has created a feminine icon for the 21st century. No longer are women subjected to simple roles as the sexpot or good girl — Margot is as three-dimensional as you can get.
Hopefully more female directors like Polley manage to create stories for the screen. It’s refreshing to see — and hear — a young voice like hers showcasing the true nature of not only women, but people as a whole.

Mohamed Morsi, former member of the Egyptian parliament and former head of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party, was elected president of Egypt on Sunday, beating out Hosni Mubarak-era prime minister Ahmed Shafik by a slim margin of 4 percent.
It’s a move that brought celebration from Muslim Brotherhood supporters — the organization was barred from political participation for many years during Mubarak’s regime — but also concern. This wariness is partly linked to the Brotherhood’s broad, potently pro-Islam stance, which advocates the religion as the base for social and political policy.
But while Morsi’s critics have much to say about the new president, the only thing the U.S. can and should do is be fully supportive of Egypt’s — and Morsi’s — new sovereignty, concerns or otherwise. After all, America’s support of Mubarak’s overthrow also made support of an Egyptian democracy crystal clear. Undermining the Egyptian people’s election of Morsi, even in light of potentially unsavory political stances that go against the United States’ strategic desires, can only do harm to America’s relationship with Egypt, a critical player in the Middle Eastern conflict.
To be fair, there’s enough history to raise questions of Morsi’s plans for the country. The new president was a long-time supporter and foot soldier for the Brotherhood, from becoming a member of an “anti-Zionist” committee in the late ’80s to promising to install Shariah law — policies based on fundamentalist Islam, criticized by many for being repressive — early in his presidential campaign.
In fact, these promises constitute the biggest red flag for Egyptians and the country’s international partners alike. As Miami Herald world affairs columnist Frida Ghitis points out, the Brotherhood once promised to run for only a minority of seats in the parliament. It also vowed to draft a constitution with the inclusion of a diverse group of more than just Islamists. And ironically, Morsi himself insisted that the Brotherhood would not offer a presidential candidate.
All these promises were broken. Morsi, looking for the moderate vote, flip-flopped and ditched his fundamentalist campaign, appearing on posters next to Christian priests and women while promising diverse support for all Egyptian groups.
In the meantime, the Brotherhood won 40 percent of the parliament (recently disbanded by the Egyptian courts), combining with the more radical Salafi party to have a two-thirds Islamist majority. And the constitution “task force” contained a hefty Islamist majority, inciting certain groups to file lawsuits and leading to the court-ordered disbandment of the panel.
In light of this and other concerns, including the future of Egypt’s relationship with Israel, it will be tempting for the U.S. to have a finger on the panic button, ready to unleash sanctions, passive-aggressive conferences, stern words and the like. There’s also intense curiosity about how Morsi will deal with the military council, which as of late has taken much of the power away from the presidential post.
Regardless of how things pan out, the U.S. has to resist the urge to intervene or influence action. As a nation, we chose to support the Egyptian citizenry’s quest for democracy. To intervene would only serve as a slap in the face, a patronizing reminder of America’s strategic jockeying for position in Middle Eastern matters, and would only inflame sentiment in the country’s increasing Islamist base.

This is an opinion only newspaper, obviously, not based on facts.  Send this editor back to school without the use of wiki blogs and anti-American upbringing.  Sad
This editorial is naive. Morsi continues to be aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood-an Islamic and anti-christian/anti-west organization that condones violence. Why does the West continue to rush to side with fundamentalists just because they have louder voices? Do we want Egypt to wind up looking like Iraq or Libya or even Saudi Arabia where Christians, women and minorities are oppressed? Mubarak was strong when we needed him to be-he stopped fundamentalism in Egypt and treated Christians well. Women were afforded rights. And peace was forged with Israel. Instead of offering him our gratitude and even a safe-have, we let him be lynched. No wonder America’s friendship means little in the world. We sell out our friends.
Sorry to be blunt, actually I’m not. But you are an idiot if you think Mubarak deserved to remain in power after three decades of his dictatorship. You sound like you care about the interests of average Egyptians but you don’t live there, you don’t know what they face, you don’t know what it was like to live under Mubarak’s rule. You criticize Morsi for “condoning violence”? Wasn’t it Mubarak who issued the orders to KILL protestors? Yeah… he sounds like a friggin pacifist.
This is the problem with Americans, and as an American, I am disgusted by our ignorance and belief that we know what’s best for the world. CLEARLY WE DON’T… if we did, Iran and Egypt wouldn’t have gone through radical revolutions which resulted in them hating us afterwards.
Also… “peace was forged with Israel”? Please. I think the better word would be “forced”.

The Westboro Baptist Church made headlines again Friday when members protested near the military funeral service of Pfc. Nathan Tyler Davis in Yucaipa, Calif., claiming that God is killing members of the military in retaliation against America’s tolerance and acceptance of homosexuality.
Christina Ellis | Summer Trojan
WBC has had more than 48,000 similar demonstrations since June 1991 and the church seems in no hurry to call it quits. WBC’s protests include “daily peaceful sidewalk demonstrations opposing the homosexual lifestyle of soul-damning, nation-destroying filth,” according to the church’s website.  Church members also carry signs that read “God Hates F-gs,” “Thank God for Dead Soldiers” and “America is Doomed” — just to name a few.
Many have argued that WBC protests should be banned or at the very least controlled, claiming the protests invade the privacy of the funerals and disrespect the memory of the fallen soldiers.
Yet as homophobic and disrespectful as the WBC protests might seem, the protesters — like everyone else — are entitled to their First Amendment right of free speech, and it’s unconstitutional for anyone to try to take that right away simply because they don’t agree with what the church has to say. In fact, the Supreme Court upheld the protection of the protesters’ right to the First Amendment in the Snyders vs. Phelps case earlier this spring.
Supreme Court rulings aside, this matter is not a mere concern of constitutionality.  It also sheds light on issues of hatred, prompting many questions: Where do we draw the line between free speech and hate speech?  When does hate speech become a hate crime?
According to popular discourse, hate speech targets a person or group because of gender, religion, race or sexual orientation, whereas hate crimes go a step further, using violence rather than words to attack.
There is no doubt that the WBC protestors are perpetrators of hate speech; they are directly attacking the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and military communities with their offensive slurs. The question now is whether this hate speech will escalate into violence.
Many in opposition to the WBC would argue that though the battle is currently non-violent, hate speech essentially serves as the gateway to hate crimes. And yet, as tempting as it might be to silence the WBC to avoid further conflict, opponents simply cannot adopt a precautionary logic and sacrifice the right of freedom of speech to do so.
There is no better middle ground than the center of the issue: speech. What better way to combat hate speech than to fire back with words and drown out the voices of the opposition? The only way this issue will avoid violence and further conflict is if people accept that WBC is entitled to say what they want — and that the opposition can make the best of their rights too.
In light of this, various veteran’s groups and others opposed to the WBC have attended funerals to create a wall around the WBC members, essentially toning down the discourse through peaceful means.
WBC spreads a hateful message, but its hate speech does not need to escalate into hate crimes — the process is not a given.  WBC is entitled to free speech, but so is everyone else.  Perhaps it’s time for the WBC’s opposition to fight fire with fire: words with words. At its core, this issue comes down to speech rights.  As it happens, speech can be the problem, but also the most effective solution.

Hate speech is an incredibly useful social control and should not be made illegal. Rather it shows us where the socially negligent and out right crazy people are, so that they can be safely avoided. At the same time, they get to vent as opposed to being herded underground, where they can hide and fester until their cause goes from “shout really loud” to “blow up the things we don’t like”.
If it does escalate to violence, we know which doors to knock on.
Westboro Baptist Church spreads its hate through picketing in our streets, provoking attacks, with abusive language and flag desecration, attempting to create a confrontation. This is not a church, this is a hate group. This is not about protesting, freedom, or God. They are in it for the money and the press; this is a family law firm. They are not a “church.” It is a scam. They go after anything that can get them in the news. This is a family of lawyers!
Drowning out someones speech is not right either.  By doing so you are not only  denying the WBC their right to speak but you are denying those how may be interested in hearing what they have to say.  why dont you people stop being so thin skinned . its pathetic.
correction : those who may be intersted…
I understand where you’re coming from but try and imagine yourself as a family member of a slain service member. No one wants to hear the garbage that comes out of these hatemongerers’ mouths so by drowning out their voices, don’t see it as covering their speech, but protecting others from it.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Friday, June 22, and Monday, June 25.
 
Crimes against a person
At 7:23 p.m., on June 25, DPS officers responded to a student who sustained a black eye when he bumped heads with another player while playing basketball. The officers examined the student and offered to request an LAFD RA unit to provide medical treatment, but he declined and was released to seek it on his own.
At 7:33 a.m., on June 25, a student reported that her boyfriend shoved her and punched her in the face when she tried to stop him from leaving her apartment due to his being intoxicated. The boyfriend was subsequently arrested by LAPD officers for a traffic related incident and LAPD detectives were advised of the connection to the student’s report.
Crimes against property
At 10:09 a.m., on June 25, a suspect used an access card to gain entry to the Clinical Science Center and an emergency key to gain entry to an office. The suspect opened a secured safe and removed currency and two laptop computers.
At 10:16 p.m., on June 22, a non-USC male flagged down DPS officers and requested assistance in locating his iPad, which he had left inside a shopping cart at Superior Grocers. The male activated a tracking device and the officers subsequently found the iPad in possession of a store employee at a nearby bus stop. The employee claimed he intended to return the iPad the following day and the male did not desire criminal prosecution of the matter. The iPad was returned to the male without further incident.
At 10:31 a.m., on June 22, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect driving a vehicle near 29th Street and Normandie Avenue that was identified as stolen by the license plate recognition system. LAPD officers were requested for assistance and the suspect and a passenger were detained for investigation when they parked the vehicle. The officers confirmed that the vehicle had been reported stolen. The suspect and the passenger were arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 3:01 p.m., on June 23, a staff member backed a university vehicle into a concrete column inside the parking structure at the LAPD’s 77th Station, causing minor damage to the vehicle.
At 6:34 p.m. on June 22, DPS officers detained a suspect who was observed drinking from an open container of alcohol in public and a subsequent check of his name revealed an outstanding warrant. The suspect was then arrested and transported for booking.

A recent study researching the financial futures of minority students pursuing majors in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields showed that these students earn at least 25 percent more than minority students majoring in the humanities or education.
The study, published in the June issue of Research in Higher Education, followed 1,000 Asian and Pacific Islander, Latino and black students over a nine-year period.
STEM futures · A study found that minorities with STEM degrees earn at least 25 percent more than those in the humanities or education. - Adrian Hoffman | Summer Trojan
Not only did research show financial differences among those with STEM majors, results showed a 50 percent difference in incomes among minorities who obtained jobs in the STEM field versus their peers who pursue professions in the humanities or education.
Tatiana Melguizo, the study’s lead researcher and associate professor at the Rossier School of Education, said that pursuing a STEM major can have a large payoff.
“We need to educate students that if they get a job in a STEM-related occupation, they have an even higher earning premium,” Melguizo said in a statement. “Otherwise, students aren’t reaping the economic benefit of all the hard work they went through as undergrads.”
Anthony Maddox, a professor of clinical education, said the income gap might be the result of the high demand for STEM skills and the need to grow the economy through applications of technology.
Though the research points to the increasing number of lucrative possibilities in the STEM fields compared to those in the humanities, Maddox said a humanities degree still has value.
“Increasingly, work in the STEM fields is highly interdisciplinary,” Maddox said. “By integrating art, design and the humanities with STEM, opportunities could emerge for more students to be involved in STEM-related disciplines.”
Gregory Wolniak, a senior research scientist at independent research organization National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and co-author of the study, said he sees the findings as hopeful evidence of a solution to the nation’s growing competitiveness problem in the science and engineering fields.
Francis Bonahon, chair of the USC mathematics department, said the true problem is the reliance on scientists and engineers who have been trained abroad, which, in the long run, will have a crippling effect on the country.
But Bonahon said middle schools and high schools can be a major roadblock in helping minority students reach their full financial potential.
“Success in the STEM fields often requires the early development of math and quantitative skills, and it is very hard to catch up in college,” Bonahon said. “Students attending good high schools have better STEM opportunities than they used to, while other schools have not seen the same progress.”

Anthony Bailey has been named to the position of interim vice provost for global initiatives and will begin his work in the post     Aug. 1.
Bailey, who currently serves as the associate provost for global initiatives, replaces Kenneth McGillivray in this new position.
In a memo to USC faculty and staff, Provost Elizabeth Garrett praised many of Bailey’s successes in USC’s international offices.
“Dr. Bailey has overseen USC’s seven international offices and he has guided our South American strategy, including the planning of an international office in Brazil, which will open in the coming year,” Garrett said. “He has also played a leading role in organizing the 2013 USC Global Conference in Seoul, South Korea.”
Bailey said his primary goal as interim vice provost for global initiatives is to continue strengthening USC’s worldwide image.
“We’d all love for USC, in a few years, to be one of the most respected and sought-after institutions in Latin America, Europe and the Middle East,” Bailey said. “The plan for my office is to continue working with key groups on campus to execute on high-profile and engaging events overseas, such as the upcoming Global Conversation this October in London.”
In addition, Bailey said another priority is collaboration with universities, governments and industry.
Bailey said he is prepared for his new post because of his experiences in international development at Kaplan Inc., an exam preparation company, and his more recent work as the associate provost in the office of global initiatives.
“At Kaplan Inc., I built up a chain of 44 international colleges spanning three continents, which was instrumental in establishing the Kaplan brand across the globe,” Bailey said. “During the past couple years as associate provost in the Office of Global Initiatives, I’ve built a base of knowledge about many of the things that make USC a unique and special place.”
Matthew Erskine, who currently serves as director of international programs at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, will fill Bailey’s current position as associate vice provost for global affairs.

More than 2,500 miles east of Los Angeles, Mohamed Morsi is preparing to begin his term as the first Egyptian president since the 2011 revolution. But 30 years ago, Morsi was studying in Los Angeles, preparing to receive a Ph.D. from USC.
Before becoming a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a member of parliament in the People’s Assembly of Egypt and the president-elect, Morsi attended Cairo University, receiving his bachelor’s and master’s degree in engineering. He completed his Ph.D. program in materials science at USC in 1982 and went on to become an assistant professor at California State University, Northridge, before heading the engineering department at Egypt’s Zagazig University in 1985.
[Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Mohamed Morsi received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering. It was materials science.]
Dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering Yannis Yortsos said Morsi’s election is a “notable achievement.”
Yortsos did not know Morsi and said his adviser died several years ago. To his knowledge, there are currently no Viterbi faculty members who knew Morsi personally.
Morsi was announced the winner of the election Sunday with 51.7 percent, beating military-supported runner-up Ahmed Shafik. He will be the first president since Hosni Mubarak formally resigned in February 2011 following the protests, which began January 25. Morsi was one of the initial candidates running for the Freedom and Justice Party, a group founded by the Muslim Brotherhood.
“That part of the world is very full of history and full of tension and turmoil,” Yortsos said. “So one hopes that [because] he was educated here in the United States … the American values and ideals will help him promote stability and peace and prosperity for his country.”
Though it is unclear what powers Morsi will have in Egypt’s reforming government, he is calling for unity in Egypt and has been publicly congratulated by the American, Turkish and Palestinian governments, according to Al Jazeera.
“Of the two possible outcomes, I’m glad that it was [Morsi] and not [Shafik],” said Laurie Brand, a professor of international relations specializing in the politics and culture of the Middle East. “But I know there are a lot of Egyptians of good faith who are very worried with the outcome.”
Samer Rashad, a junior majoring in neuroscience, traveled to Egypt in May and June to study the political process and to compare the election to those of America and other countries in the Middle East.
“In Egypt, not many people like Morsi,” he said. “They don’t want Egypt to turn into an Islamic state. They want it to be more like America, in a way, with separation of church and state.”
Rashad stayed with his uncle, Hamdeen Sabahi, a former parliament member and third-place candidate in the election. Rashad said Sabahi was the most moderate of the top three contenders in both religious and political views.
“I was not a fan of either Morsi or Shafik,” Rashad said. “I guess me and my family are not too happy Morsi won.”
Cat Shieh, a junior majoring in political science, spent two weeks in Egypt through Problems without Passports in May and June of 2011, a few months after the Egyptian government fell. Shieh said her experiences and continued interest in Egypt have helped her understand the culture.
“You have to realize the complexities of the Muslim Brotherhood,” Shieh said. “They’re not all extremists.”
Shieh said she cannot predict how the government might evolve but sees potential for democracy and Sharia law to coexist if the complex factors are understood.
“I’m not optimistic, but I’m not pessimistic either,” Shieh said. “I don’t think we’ll be able to see a lot of change now, but he was better educated so who knows. I’m waiting for the next generation.”

USC is seeking to dismiss a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the parents of two Chinese graduate students who were shot off-campus around 1 a.m. in April. The parents of Ming Qu and Ying Wu, both 23-year-old electrical engineering students, filed the suit May 16 in Los Angeles Superior Court.
USC’s defense is being led by Debra Wong Yang, a former United States attorney who is now a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.  USC court papers filed June 18 assert that the university is not responsible for the shootings, according to City News Service.
“Boiled down to its core elements, [the] complaint is nothing more than an attempt to try to hold USC financially responsible for damages inflicted on its students by the criminal behavior of third parties unrelated to USC,” the papers state.
Judge Michael Johnson is scheduled to hear the dismissal motion Aug. 24, according to City News Service.
Bryan Barnes, 20, and Javier Bolden, 19, are facing murder charges for the double homicide of Qu and Wu. If convicted due to special circumstances allegations, Barnes and Bolden face the death penalty. Their arraignment, which was planned for June 25, was postponed until July 18.

Buckner will be an attacker for Team USA in his first Olympic Games. His previous international appearances include the 2011 FINA world championships and the 2011 and 2012 FINA World League Super Finals.
Buckner served up 110 goals during his three seasons at USC.
He was a member of USC’s 2008 and 2009 NCAA championship teams, the former of which went undefeated and started USC’s current historic run of four straight titles.
He stands as USC’s No. 23 all-time leading scorer and a three-time All-American, including as a first-teamer in his junior and senior seasons.
Buckner’s selection marks the second USC representative in this year’s Olympic men’s water polo field.
Goalie Joel Dennerley, Buckner’s teammate on the 2008 and 2009 NCAA championship teams, will be competing as a member of Australia’s Olympic squad.
Buckner and Dennerley will be competing in the Olympics for the first time, and their selections mark the fourth straight time that Trojans have participated in Olympic water polo.

After leading the USC squad to the national championship game this spring, six members of USC’s women’s water polo team have been named All-Americans by the Association of Collegiate Water Polo Coaches.
Freshman driver Monica Vavic, the only USC (23-6) player to earn first-team honors, became the first true freshman to be named a first-team All-American and first-team All-MPSF player since 1999.

Sophomore goalkeeper Flora Bolonyai and senior Nadia Dan were named All-Americans for the second time, as Bolonyai was selected to the second team and Dan earned honorable mention.
Sophomore two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist (second team), sophomore two-meter Colleen O’Donnell (honorable mention) and junior driver Dominique Sardo (honorable mention) rounded out USC’s sextet on the All-American honor roll by earning their first career national honors.
Vavic led the Women of Troy in assists this season and was the squad’s second leading scorer with 39 goals. She was named to the NCAA All-Tournament first team, scoring five goals in USC’s run to the finals.
Bolonyai, who will participate in this summer’s Olympic Games in London as part of the Hungarian national team, averaged 8.6 saves and 5.2 goals-against per game for the Women of Troy this season. She boosted her numbers in the postseason, averaging 10.1 saves and allowing 4.5 goals per game during the MPSF and NCAA tournaments, earning second-team status for both tournaments.
Gilchrist joined Bolonyai on the second team after leading the Women of Troy in 2012 with 47 goals. She also earned All-MPSF Second Team honors.
Dan, a senior who becomes a two-time All-American in her final season at Troy, was fourth on the team in scoring with 25 goals, putting her career scoring mark at 107 career goals to go along with her championship from the 2010 season.
Sardo, who was also on that 2010 championship team, picked up her first All-American honors this season after netting 23 goals for USC and being selected to the All-MPSF Honorable Mention squad.
O’Donnell also earned honorable mention after racking up 24 goals for the Women of Troy in her second year at USC.
Stanford was the only school to have more players named All-Americans than USC, with eight members of Stanford’s NCAA championship squad receiving national recognition.
All in all, 57 players from around the country earned All-American honors. Seven players each were named to the first, second and third teams while 36 players earned honorable mention.

USC senior Bryshon Nellum and sophomore Josh Mance qualified for the U.S. Olympic team after their efforts at the U.S. track & field Olympic trials in Eugene, Ore., on Sunday.
Nellum, who suffered gunshot wounds to each of his thighs and his left hamstring in 2008, placed third in the 400-meter dash with a personal record of 44.8 seconds.

With about 70 meters left in the race, Nellum rallied from sixth place and edged Mance and Manteo Mitchell to capture the final spot on the 400-meter team.
“I kept faith in God, kept going day by day, kept working hard and stayed dedicated,” he said in a statement.
Nellum’s time is good for fourth on USC’s all-time 400-meter dash list. He will join LaShawn Merritt and Florida’s Tony McQuay to make up the 400-meter team.
With a time of 44.88 seconds, Mance finished fourth and missed a spot on the 400-meter team but qualified for the 4×400-meter relay pool.
“We have worked on finishes and they both did that very well today,” USC director of track and field Ron Allice said in a statement. “All the credit goes to them.”
USC alumni Jesse Williams and Duane Solomon also made the U.S. Olympic team in the men’s high jump and men’s 800-meter dash, respectively.
Though Williams placed fourth in the high jump finals on Monday, he has jumped the Olympic A standard qualifying height of 7-foot-7 this year while third-place finisher Nick Ross did not, giving Williams the nod to represent the United States.
Solomon ran a 1:44.65 in the 800-meter dash, which surpassed the Olympic A standard qualifying time that he had yet to fulfill. His finish was just .01 seconds behind second-place finisher Khadevis Robinson.
The U.S. Track & Field Olympic Trials will resume Thursday, where senior Dalilah Muhammad will run the women’s 400-meter individual hurdles, senior Aareon Payne will run the women’s 200-meter dash and junior Reggie Wyatt will run the men’s 400-meter individual hurdles.
USC alumni Brendan Ames, Logan Taylor and Ryan Wilson will all participate in the first round of men’s 110-meter high hurdles round on Friday.
