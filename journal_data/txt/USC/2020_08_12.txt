In a typical fall semester, USC welcomes 10,000 new and continuing students to its on- and near-campus housing facilities. First-year students move in a week before courses begin and kick off their college experience with a week of community-building activities and social events. 
The following Monday, campus is filled with students ready for a new semester of classes and extracurricular activities. Students sign up for clubs at the Involvement Fair on Parkway, make friends in the dining hall and throw up “Fight On” signs at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
This fall, the campus life experience will look different. Welcome Week, the quintessential period of freshmen’s acclimation to USC, will take place online. Campus and residential housing will stand nearly empty with limited residents. Many international students will be spared the jetlag of flying to Los Angeles, but their sleep schedules might be disrupted by the timing of their class meetings. To get to class, students won’t navigate campus, but rather Blackboard and Zoom.
The first-year experience
For incoming students like Maya Neuenschwander, an industrial systems engineering major from Wisconsin, this semester will take on a whole new look. Neuenschwander plans to attend classes from her bedroom, continuing to work as a barista and structuring her day with built-in study time and morning yoga. Her at-home schedule for the fall reminds her of the end of her senior year, she said. 
It’s the lack of the usual college experience that will make this semester so different for students like Neuenschwander, who would have spent the first month mingling with dorm-room neighbors and new friends at Welcome Week events. 
But for Neuenschwander, the welcome experience will happen at home alongside her mom, dad and younger sister — and her twin brother, who is also attending USC. She said her family is excited to stream the events on TV and watch them together. 
Instead of jumping along to music in swimsuits at Splash Bash or engaging in spontaneous 2 a.m. conversations with new dorm friends, much of the Fall 2020 incoming student experience will occur from students’ respective homes around the world. It goes without saying that this year’s incoming student experience will be like no other — with new possibilities for socialization that have never before been considered. 
Despite the change in circumstance, Student Affairs and campus partners are working to create a virtual Welcome Experience for incoming students. Many of these students — whether they plan to live near campus or at home — are hoping to connect with their peers.
Neuenschwander said she decided to stay home when USC announced July 1 that housing would be limited. Adapting to the new normal of increased virtual interactions, she met friends at ExploreUSC last spring who she still talks to online and posted on the USC2024 Instagram page to make connections. 
“I’m just curious to see how we’re going to meet more people and how they’re necessarily going to network us together,” Neuenschwander said. “I do think it’ll be unique, but I really don’t know any differently about college.”
While annual events like Splash Bash, a Residential College Cup opening at Galen Center, and day trips around L.A. won’t be recreated online, much of the usual Welcome Experience will be. Convocation, the SPARK! Visions & Voices kick-off event and the Welcome Back concert will be livestreamed. 
SPARK!, usually limited to USC students, will be open to anyone and will feature live performances and a virtual dance party. Attendees can choose to join a “backstage” Zoom where they will be allowed to turn on their video and the host will rotate spotlighting different participants. 
The Residential College Cup, a competition between freshman dorms that involves a 5k, a talent show and a spirit rally, will host an online event called Spirit and Tradition. Interim Residential Education Director Grant Burlew said that the event will still involve large-scale programming but may be open to more students and no longer include college points. 
Certain large events will be available to all incoming students; however, other smaller events, like virtual floor meetings and faculty meet and greets, are intended to help foster connections between incoming students living in USC Housing. These events are still being finalized as USC waits for Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to approve campus plans.
Beyond ResEd, there will be other opportunities for students to connect. Campus Activities will continue Late Night ‘SC events, such as virtual paint day and trivia nights. Asian Pacific American Student Services, the Center for Black Cultural Student Affairs, the Latinx/Chicanx Center for Advocacy and Student Affairs and the LGBT Resource Center all have online open houses and welcome events planned.
Experience USC, a virtual quad that Interim Associate Vice Provost for Student Affairs, Student Engagement Emily Sandoval described as a “one stop hub for all student activity” launched Aug. 10. Once students are in the quad they will be able to select keywords to search for events related to their interests and potentially chat with other students as if actually passing each other in McCarthy Quad, Sandoval said. 
For students tired of Zoom, Student Affairs is looking at other platforms such as Remo, a virtual immersive space that allows for engagement. She recently demoed a virtual Trojan TCC ballroom on Remo, which allowed users to see a ballroom floor plan and click on tables with conversation topics to engage with other users.
“You’re not going to meet people on large Zoom events,” Sandoval said. “So we’re really trying to focus on how can we make these smaller events more impactful and find the correct platforms that allow students to meet each other in this virtual world.” 
Some students have already started forming connections through social media. Incoming freshman Ashley Espinosa, who plans to major in urban planning, said she started using social media to connect with other students even before she knew her return to campus could be delayed. She said she had joined a Hispanic group chat on Snapchat and has been able to make new friends there.
“I’ve been reaching out, I’ve been communicating with other students, I’ve been trying to get involved,” Espinosa said. “A lot of us have been finding our own groups of people … so even though I might not be on campus, I’m still trying to form connections.”
However, some students are not putting as much stock in making online social connections this semester. Tyler Olsen, a sophomore transfer student majoring in business, said he opted out of USC Village housing and signed a lease for an off-campus apartment before the Marshall School of Business announced all of its classes would be online. 
“I’m not a fan of meeting people online — I don’t think it’s authentic,” Olsen said. “I’m hoping to surf a lot in the fall. I was originally not going to have a car, but now I’m bringing my truck down because we’re online. So I’m going to hopefully go to the beach and get into surfing a little bit.”

Studies from abroad
With ongoing public health updates and changes from USC adjusting to the rising number of coronavirus cases, the situation remains uncertain for international students as they decide whether to return or take classes from their home country. Rachel Cai, a senior majoring in psychology and business administration, returned to campus July 30 to avoid attending her classes from the hours of 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. in Hong Kong.
Upon arrival at Los Angeles International Airport, Cai was taken to a separate room where an immigration officer told her she was not allowed to return to the United States and said immigration had sent back other returning students and canceled their visas. He ultimately allowed her to enter but noted in her file that if she did not have in-person classes, her visa would be canceled and she would have to return home. 
“I think it’s pretty ridiculous because I have to go through all this trouble of contacting an immigration lawyer, paying them … I have done nothing wrong,” Cai said. “I followed the rules, and I’ve done what I’m allowed to do. I didn’t go outside of those guidelines.”
Now, with the fall semester being held mostly online and issues of ongoing flight limitations, health risks of traveling and the rising number of cases in California and L.A. County, many international students are opting to remain at home. However, these students are facing various obstacles such as taking classes from drastically different time zones and awaiting updates from Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding their visa status for those hoping to return to the United States in the near future. 
On July 6, ICE announced a since-rescinded international student policy that would only allow international students from institutions with in-person or hybrid classes to remain in the United States while canceling the visas of students taking online classes from their home countries. 
While the policy was reversed to allow international students the flexibility to stay at home or return to the United States for online classes, incoming first-year students will not be issued visas and must take classes from home.  
Alfonso Aguilar Vasquez, a freshman majoring in business administration, initially planned to travel to L.A. but following the ICE announcement preventing incoming freshmen from getting student visas, he decided to stay in Mexico. Vasquez said he believes remaining at his home residence is the best decision he could make with the many restrictions placed on campus life.
“I was kind of thinking ‘Well is this even worth it at this point to go to campus and just be locked up in a room the whole time,” Vasquez said, “when I could be in Mexico with my family when it’s not such a large time difference?’” 
Kabir Malhotra, a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering, will be unable to attend classes in L.A. following three postponements of his visa appointments due to embassy closures in Dubai because of the coronavirus and ICE guidelines that have stopped student visas from being issued. 
Although Malhotra initially planned to defer his enrollment to spring since he wished to experience his first semester as a freshman in person, he ultimately decided to begin in the fall and take advantage of online classes after talking to students in his department who experienced remote learning in the spring. 
“I’ve spoken to quite a few seniors and the feedback that I have gotten is that online classes — although it’s not as fun or you don’t learn as much compared to in-person class, especially because it’s engineering — they said that it’s a lot easier to score [well],” Malhotra said. “I’m taking 20 credits the first semester. ”
Nicole Pavlopoulou, a sophomore majoring in human biology, hoped to return to L.A. from her home in Greece to continue varsity swim team practices on campus. But with coronavirus cases surging in L.A. compared to Greece, where restrictions have eased, she’s wondering if she should return. In Greece, cases remain just above 5,000 compared to L.A. County’s 207,000 at the time of publication.  
“I’m really sad because we have such a great team and we are all so close together,” Pavlopoulou said. “I was really hoping I would go back to train because the facilities … and training are far better than here … [However,] I don’t want to go somewhere that there’s like a very high possibility that I may get infected.”
With limited and expensive flights available, Pavlopoulou said she would wait until September or October to return to campus, following the recommendation of her team’s coach to international students. 
For Krtin Jain, a junior majoring in electrical engineering, the more than 12-hour time difference between India and L.A. concerns him after his experience the previous spring semester staying up all night to attend his classes and sleeping during the day. 
On Aug. 7 Provost Charles Zukoski issued new guidelines for faculty to better accomodate international students. Under the new guidance, faculty are not permitted to require attendance in synchronous course components for students for whom the class meets outside of the 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. window in their time zone. Classes will also be recorded, automatically transcribed and posted to Blackboard for all students to view. Faculty are also encouraged to be mindful of time differences by incorporating multiple office hour sessions and examination dates.  
Jain also decided not to return to campus for the fall semester after his parents expressed concern at the rising cases in the United States and the lack of family support he would have if he contracted the virus. While he has accepted staying at home and attending his classes throughout the night, Jain worries that one of his classes, which requires external material, will not be able to send him the package in time for the start of class. 
Diya Mehta, a senior majoring in business administration, also considered taking a leave of absence. But her online production internship requires her to apply for curricular practical training, a temporary employment authorization needed by those on F-1 student visas to work off campus. Mehta said she hopes her visa status is not affected since that would impact future internship and job opportunities.
Programs like Opitional Practical Training and Curricular Practical Training that help international students get work experience in the United States are part of the reason Mehta and her family pay for an international education. If her eligibility were affected by changed rules due to the pandemic, she said she would be devastated.
While upset about not returning to campus for the fall semester of her senior year, Mehta is thankful to be safe at home. 
“There’s a lot of good experiences that I’m going to be missing out on, like the last game day,” Mehta said. “It’s definitely upsetting, but I think I’m kind of looking at it glass half full and just being grateful that I’m safe and with my family.”

Residential living
The University touts its residential experience, comprising monthly Residential Education programming and communal living, as an instrumental component of students’ first years of college. Ordinarily, most rooms in USC Housing facilities are double-occupancy. Residents share common spaces, including lounges, study areas and in-hall fitness centers.
The coronavirus pandemic has overhauled residential life, as USC-owned housing, originally set to begin move-in Aug. 10, is postponing new student residents’ move-in to an undetermined date.
An Aug. 5 email from Provost Charles Zukoski and Senior Vice President of Administration David Wright stated that the University did not have permission from L.A. County to house residents and asked students to delay their return to campus indefinitely.  
The change in policy means some students — like Genesis Guerra, a sophomore majoring in international relations and American studies — do not have reliable housing for the upcoming semester. Guerra had planned to stay at Cardinal Gardens but has spent the summer couch surfing while waiting for move-in to begin. With the latest announcement, she isn’t sure if she and her friends in similar circumstances will have a permanent home from which to take remote classes.
“Even with all of the restrictions that USC was imposing — like no guests, all of that — we were all OK if it meant that we would have a roof over our heads,” Guerra said. “My only source of living for the upcoming school year was going to be at USC housing.”
Zeina Badawl, a sophomore majoring in computer science, came to L.A. from Cairo ahead of the start of classes as part of a two week quarantine the L.A. County Department of Public Health required for international students. Now, she doesn’t know if or when she can move into her Cardinal Gardens apartment.
“It just feels like [USC Housing] told us that they were going to live up to their contracts, and they made it seem like that was a certainty,” Badawi said. “It just seems very inconvenient that everybody who’s here at the time they’re supposed to be here is now scrambling to find different housing.”
The announcement came nearly two months after Student Health confirmed that all rooms would be reduced to single-occupancy to better facilitate social distancing and reduce inter-resident contact. Fitness facilities also remain closed until further notice, and lounges — which typically serve as places to congregate for leisure and class projects — will now be reserved for use by individual students with telehealth appointments. 
Under the new contract, which all students choosing to live in USC Housing this semester have agreed to, residents will be asked to maintain proper social distancing and wear face coverings in public areas of the residence hall. The agreement also prohibits all guests, including family members and fellow residents, although a petition created by Paige Raskin, a senior majoring in psychology, asking the University to reinstate guest privileges has amassed more than 200 signatures to date. 
According to the revised housing agreement, students who violate the new housing contract will be asked to vacate their rooms with no reimbursement.
Faced with the choice between a dramatically different on-campus experience with an unconfirmed move-in date or another semester of Zoom classes at home, some students selected a third option: off-campus housing. 
Maya Caselnova, a freshman majoring in international relations, knew she wanted to leave her Indianapolis home to start college and originally hoped to live in McCarthy Honors Hall or Birnkrant Residential College. However, growing increasingly frustrated with the frequently changing USC Housing communication, she decided to withdraw her housing application to live at the Colonel’s Mansion.
“I decided to come to L.A. in the end because I wanted to get situated and get to know the area in L.A. a lot more, and I wanted to participate a bit more in any activities that will be on campus — if there are any activities on campus,” Caselnova said. “I’m kind of hoping that the spring semester will have more on-campus and in-person activities.” 
Upperclassmen who had already signed on-campus housing contracts reselected spaces in mid-July, while incoming freshmen — who would normally confirm their housing assignments in May — were told in a July 2 email from USC Housing that they would be assigned to an available room without input on building or room type. A July email from USC Housing projected that only one-fourth of freshmen would receive fall housing. Both freshmen and upperclassmen were given the opportunity to withdraw their applications. Freshmen had not confirmed their housing assignments or paid their deposits at the time of the email, while upperclassmen who had put down deposits were fully refunded the cost if they chose not to continue with housing selection.
Resident assistants have been given the option to abdicate their roles and remain at their permanent residences for the duration of the semester, an offer that 36 of the original 201 RAs had accepted as of the end of July. For this year only, RAs who decide to remain at home during the fall may opt to return to campus and their RA positions in the spring semester. RAs who do not choose to defer or step down are subject to the same indefinite move-in delays as other residents.
RAs usually move into their housing assignments in early August to partake in two weeks of training preceding move-in and the start of Welcome Week. Before the announcement that students would not be able to move into housing at the start of the fall semester, RA move-in was postponed until Aug. 10 after first being pushed from Aug. 1 to Aug. 7. RAs were notified of the postponement nine days prior to the would-be RA move-in date, and several RAs expressed anxiety and frustration over their changing living situations. 
Rachel Holzer, a junior majoring in international relations, is part of a group of RAs who wrote and signed a letter to ResEd and the Office of Student Affairs following the July 29 announcement that RA move-in would be delayed five days. 
“I think a lot of RAs are really, really anxious and kind of panicking right now because we’re not sure if we’re going to have a place to live in the upcoming semester,” Holzer said. “We’ve all planned all of our finances and all of our travel plans and flights around guaranteed RA housing, and now with about nine days’ notice, all of those plans are kind of up in the air now.”
The RAs’ letter made several requests, including interim housing for RAs who had not made other arrangements for a later move-in date, compensation for preterm training, more transparent communication from ResEd and permission for RAs who withdrew from the position to receive priority as RAs in the spring. 
“We, the Resident Assistants of the University of Southern California, are frustrated by the lack of transparency on behalf of the university administration and Residential Education regarding our living accommodations for the academic year,” the letter read. “If this continues, how will we be able to take care of the health and wellbeing of our residents when the ResEd office has struggled to do so for us?”
Interim Residential Education Director Grant Burlew emailed all RAs July 31 to outline accommodations ResEd is making for RAs, including the option to defer to the spring semester and information about University-provided housing for RAs unable to live at home in the case that move-in and housing do not proceed as planned.
Other freshmen decided to stay at home for the fall semester following the memorandum recommending students not come to campus in August and reversing the University’s earlier announcement that most classes would be offered in a hybrid format. Senna Kolagotla, a rising freshman majoring in computer science and business administration, said she had been contemplating living in an apartment off campus until her single hybrid class switched to fully remote in late July. Kolagotla will now remain at her Gilroy, Calif. residence through the fall.
Kolagotla said she looks forward to beginning college but predicted that the social dynamic will be different without meeting her peers face to face in a residence hall.
“For a lot of freshmen, this is like the next chapter of our lives — we were going to live on campus, meet new people, make new friends,” Kolagotla said. “While the University is trying to do a lot for us to be able to meet new students, I feel like it won’t be the same because it won’t be that same connection you would have when you met your roommates or when you make new friends.”

Rethinking instruction
Callie McAdams, a sophomore majoring in political science, worries about the continued virtual format of online classes that has transferred onto the fall semester. While she believes her professors did their best after the shift to remote instruction in spring, she is worried about how remote learning will affect her college experience.
McAdams is not alone in her uncertainty regarding online classes. When the University announced in early August that all classes except a few clinical education practica will be taught remotely, many faculty and students’ academic plans for the fall semester changed course.
While online classes have been deemed the most viable substitute for in-person instruction, they do not come without complications. 
In addition to working around the time difference, students and faculty have to find ways to remain engaged in class without in-person conversations. Communication professor Jillian Pierson said she worries in-class involvement will be a daunting task this semester. She hopes that by grading participation instead of attendance, students will be more motivated to contribute to class conversations.  
“I think it’s hard as a faculty member to read the room when we’re online — unlike face-to-face, where I can see if people are engaged or not,” Pierson said. “I’m going to personally be working on soliciting engagement probably even more than I do ordinarily. I think it is hard to sit alone in a room and look at a screen and stay engaged.” 
Another complication students face is the lack of “hands-on” labs this semester. Serena Yi, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, said she usually takes classes with in-person labs and demonstrations, but all her courses have moved online in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
“I’m interested to see how USC will adapt and kind of still keep the curriculum the same and the education quality the same,” Yi said. “With physics … we can do a lot of online simulations, but with biology I feel like it should be a lot more hands-on.”
Jessie Landes, a sophomore majoring in theatre, found that for some of her required theatre courses, it is difficult to adapt to the online platform. Many students in her classes, she said, have never acted on camera before, and have to learn a new format on top of the course content.
“There really is just no way to make an acting performance movement style class as effective when it’s through a screen,” Landes said. “Theatre is meant to be live, and to do it through a screen is definitely challenging.”
While many students do not find remote classes ideal, administrators and faculty members said they have been working to ensure this semester’s classes will continue to offer a range of new experiences, innovative learning opportunities and teaching strategies adapted to the distance-learning model. 
The USC Center for Excellence in Teaching has been holding virtual workshops and training for faculty members to improve their fluency with online instructional platforms. The center provides resources to assist faculty with obstacles like online troubleshooting, reconfiguring course content and implementing active learning techniques into virtual classes. 
Theatre professor Rodney To said he believes the shift to online learning will provide a valuable template for future remote education. To said that in his own classes this semester, he will emphasize the importance of taking breaks during instruction so that students can remain engaged while looking at a computer screen. 
“I think this has forced us into rethinking education,” To said. “It’s challenging, to say the least — but it’s also exciting, you know, when you can teach an old dog new tricks.”

Amid national unrest over police brutality and racism across the country, the USC community has been experiencing an internal confrontation of campus anti-Blackness over the past few months. In the wake of the resurgence of Black Lives Matter protests in late May following the killing of George Floyd, USC students, faculty, alumni and staff began mobilizing and creating lists of demands related to racism, sexism, affordability, diversity and inclusion, and more for the University and its programs to address. 
These demands, which have been compiled from student organizations, academic departments, faculty and student activists, began after hundreds of Black students, faculty, staff and alumni anonymously shared their experiences of racism and microaggressions through the Instagram account @black_at_usc. The account has inspired action from student organizations and faculty that demand concrete and systemic change from the University moving forward.
After Sol, a senior who uses a pseudonym for fear of retaliation, created the digital space and platform for Black Trojans to share their experiences, the University’s Instagram page issued a post acknowledging the shared testimony. One day later, President Carol Folt’s anti-racism initiatives were released, outlining programs USC would implement in response to hundreds of allegations of injustice, including focus group interviews with Black students, faculty, staff and alumni, public forums to discuss grievances, campus climate surveys and professional learning workshops for University employees.
Though the University pledged itself to action, many Black Trojans and community members at-large felt the plans fell dramatically short of what was needed. Some students took to social media to express their frustration and felt that forums and focus groups were further traumatizing and unnecessary.
In line with this frustration over the University’s allegedly lackluster response, more than 380 faculty members and three faculty councils from Concerned Faculty of USC sent a letter to Folt and other administrators July 8, which criticized USC’s plans for addressing systemic racism and anti-Blackness.
While the letter compared USC’s response to peer institutions, alleging that UCLA and Stanford University’s action items were more comprehensive and appropriate, the letter also acknowledged the ongoing work of students.
“We have read hundreds of moving testimonies from our students and staff members on the Black_at_USC Instagram account about their experience of racism on campus,” the letter read, critiquing Folt’s initiative to survey students about such experiences. “Our students do not need to further educate us on their experience; they need our active support through material change to USC’s campus structures and culture.”
Concerned Faculty’s letter comprises a comprehensive list of demands, including addressing racial profiling, Department of Public Safety funding and practices; focusing on diversity and trauma support for Black students with increased mental health resources; improving curriculum diversity and requirements; hiring, retaining and tenuring more Black academics and women of color and considering how USC’s previous fall reopening plans adversely impact Black and Indigenous people and people of color, all of whom are at the highest risk of infection.
The list of demands from faculty was released at the same time Sol decided to compile a list of communal grievances after believing University administrators were not committed enough to real change. In a post on @black_at_usc, Sol invited Black students to submit demand ideas to present to USC; she received more than 300 responses.
The demands were posted to the account July 9 and called for Folt to reevaluate her earlier initiatives. The demands include divesting from DPS, refunneling funds to community efforts that support Black and Indigenous students and students of color, reevaluating the necessity for officers to carry lethal weapons and the requirement of de-escalation training for all officers.
Similar to calls from Concerned Faculty, these demands also asked USC to hire and retain more Black faculty and launch investigations into professors named in testimony of racism experienced by students. Sol also received demands for USC to publish salary reviews and increase the Black student and faculty population to better reflect the demographics of the United States. According to USC’s 2019-20 Facts and Figures, approximately 3% of all faculty and 5% of students are Black — 13% of the U.S. population is Black, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 
In addition to increasing USC’s Black student population, the demands further elaborate on the requisite steps the University needs to take in order to do so, including funding Black cultural spaces; reviving plans for a space for Black students in the USC Village; reestablishing the Awujo House resolution, a 24/7 cultural space for Black students; improving admission outreach and merit scholarship granting; reviving the Historically Black Colleges and Universities exchange program and dismantling Greek life. 
Efforts to increase spaces for Black students have been ongoing. In October 2014, students drafted a resolution in the wake of campus racial tensions to build the Awujo House. These efforts also sparked the “I, Too, Am USC” digital project that created a safe space for marginalized students on campus to share their experiences.
In her most recent address to USC on these concerns, Folt said that while the University has already started addressing ongoing issues, such as the removal of former USC president and eugenics leader Rufus von KleinSmid’s name from the Center for International and Public Affairs and the hosting of numerous webinars and forums, other initiatives are proceeding. 
Some ongoing actions include the reporting of incidents to the new Office of Equity, Equal Opportunity and Title IX, the completed formation of a DPS Community Advisory Board, the continued creation of the Task Force on Racial Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and the search underway for USC’s first chief inclusion and diversity officer. Folt also announced the launch of the First Generation Plus Success Center and expanded programming for marginalized students.
Student organizations and assemblies have also joined the fight for change, releasing their own petitions and lists of demands to the University. Undergraduate Student Government, in particular, has been at the center of discussions of exclusivity and racism on campus.
On July 7, USG President Truman Fritz resigned after multiple students came forward via submissions on the @black_at_usc page to accuse him of engaging in microaggressive and anti-Black behavior. USG Sen. Isabel Washington also resigned after crude text messages and conversations with former USG assistant director Nathaniel Manor about racial and religious groups surfaced on social media. Manor, who ran in the 2020-21 USG Senate elections, placed 13th in the race for 12 positions and would have succeeded Washington. However, in a letter to the undergraduate student body July 1, USG stated that the open position will not be open for Manor and will be filled at the beginning of the academic year. USG Vice President Rose Ritch stepped down after students alleged her complicity and silence in supporting Fritz.
USG said it is currently working on initiatives in response to student demands, including reevaluating USC’s relationship with the Los Angeles Police Department and DPS. USG also said Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development has been discussing the revival of a Black House on Greek Row. Sen. Lennon Wesley III is in the initial stages of working on a project to foster office-student interaction through forums centered on the Black and Indigenous student and student of color experiences. 
“We know that as Student Government, we have a powerful platform to address things such as racial injustice, national issues, and discrimination,” USG wrote.
Work without compensation
The Black Student Assembly, one of the student programming organizations under USG, has been at the forefront of student-led activism for the Black community. According to co-executive director Calvin Carmichael, he and the rest of BSA’s executive board have been working 20 to 30 hours each week to improve the student experience for Black students. 
“I feel like, especially at a large predominantly white institution, a lot of time, a lot of the work to improve the BIPOC student experience comes from BIPOC students doing that work, and I think USC needs to pay a lot of attention to that because at the end of the day, it’s something that we aren’t being compensated for,” Carmichael said. 
BSA is currently working with the administration to create bias training for DPS, as well as tackling a presented list of demands to DPS. The assembly is also collaborating with Concerts Committee to use the Welcome Back Concert as a platform to talk about current events, creating a fundraiser to raise money for the AmASSI Center for Black Wellness & Culture, a local organization focused on providing resources and information to improve the mental and community health of Black individuals, and working on a solidarity protest for the 2020 March on Washington. However, Carmichael said the University’s actions in response to BSA’s demands are not satisfactory for the organization and “are more performative than anything.” 
“This is the time where [the administration] should be listening to us with open arms, so that’s kind of what we’re expecting, but sometimes, they haven’t been like that,” Carmichael said. “We’re trying to figure out the balance of what we can and can’t get done. They need to be doing more. It’s like … ‘If you really want to put us as a priority, actually listen to us, really think about and understand what’s going on, and what students’ concerns are.’” 
Other programming organizations affiliated with USG have also begun to make internal organizational changes, while also holding the University community to a higher standard. According to Environmental Student Assembly co-director Jackson Fitzgerald, ESA is planning more events focused on cultural diversity, including a speaker panel on environmental justice and racism, and emphasizing working on events with other cultural organizations to share sustainability efforts with as many students as possible. ESA has also reopened its executive board applications to increase the diversity of the organization’s leadership. Originally, there were no Black students on ESA’s executive board, although all applicants were hired. 
Similarly, the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment has only one Black student on its executive board, while the Latinx Student Assembly has none. 
“Now, more than ever, is the time for organizations to band together and to actually speak on the historic whiteness of the University as a whole, and their organizations,” said SAGE Executive Director Alexia Sambrano. “Us, as a part of USG, have kind of been complicit in the biases or the dismissal of student voices, which is wrong, and that’s something that, as organizations, we need to own up to.”
Evolving education
However, organizations outside of USG have also called for change within long-standing practices at the University. Delta Phi Epsilon, USC’s foreign service society and international relations professional fraternity, created a petition and letter to USC’s Political Science and International Relations department. The petition currently has more than 300 signatures and outlined demands related to anti-racism initiatives, including increased diversity within the department’s faculty and curriculum. 
“Our curriculum doesn’t focus nearly on developing countries, and if they do, it’s talking about them in conjunction with countries from the West,” DPE Diversity Chair Nana-ama Andoh said. “[We focus on] Europe, the United States and China, and that’s basically it. We rarely focus on Southeast Asian countries, African countries or Latin American countries.” 
According to Andoh, after the presentation of the petition and letter to the department, chairwoman Saori Katada and other members of POIR leadership reached out to DPE and will be having a meeting to discuss the demands presented. 
“I don’t want to leave USC in the same way that I came into it,” Andoh said. “It’s really important that everyone — it doesn’t matter if you’re Black, white, Asian, whatever — everyone needs to take the steps to make sure they’re also doing the same thing. You want to see [USC] improve and do better for all students, not just people like you.”
Digital discussions of diversity, equity and inclusion and student-based mobilization have also been taking place within the Schools of Cinematic Arts, Dramatic Arts, Architecture and other programs. Students have also taken to social media to create lists of demands and a platform for students to call attention to closely-tied issues of campus gender-based violence, sexual assault and campus affordability. 
Black students in the Roski School of Art and Design and the School of Architecture posted a list of demands on BSA’s Instagram account, which include mandatory race and bias training for faculty, admiting more Black students, hiring more Black faculty, incorporating community-based initiatives for Black and brown students, integrating topics of class, race, sex, gender and culture into the curriculum and expanding financial aid for students, among other demands.
Students behind the Instagram account @affordable.sc also created a list of demands advocating for increased financial aid, emergency grants for low-income students, expanded aid for undocumented students and a decrease in tuition by 35% for the duration of the pandemic. USC’s student-led Affordable Student Housing Initiative has also mobilized digital support through its Instagram account @uscashi to demand housing security for vulnerable students.
“The global pandemic created unstable living and learning environments for first-generation, low-income (FGLI) students,” AffordableSC’s letter of demands to administrators read. “Through cutting financial aid, USC is placing disproportionate burden on students of color, undocumented students, and low-income students. The University therefore neglects its most vulnerable groups of students and continues to uphold systemic barriers.”
As the fall semester begins with students taking online classes from all across the world, students are continuing to mobilize with demands for change at the University through social media. Though some departments have met with student leaders and activists to begin addressing demands, a collective University response to these demands has yet to be seen.

USC Concerts Committee is responsible for orchestrating some of the biggest and most exciting events of the school year. From the Welcome Back Concert to Conquest! and Springfest, members of the committee create and coordinate unforgettable live music experiences for USC students. 
Having previously featured artists such as Saweetie, Migos, Gunna, Playboi Carti, Trippie Redd and Still Woozy, Concerts Committee works with agents to book performers for its events, which are free to USC students. 
Springfest 2020 was supposed to be held in late March in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum but was canceled due to concerns over the coronavirus. With a nearly empty campus in August and restrictions imposed on large gatherings, sporting events and live shows in L.A. County, Springfest won’t be the last concert cancellation. 
Concerts Committee co-executive director Samantha Gibbs, along with her team, is now dealing with a colossal dilemma: How can the organization do its job when concerts and big crowds are prohibited for the time being?
While traditional large, in-person events like the Welcome Back Concert and Conquest! are out of the question, Concerts Committee is quickly pivoting toward providing entertainment for students at a socially acceptable distance — virtually.
Stepping into its mid-Spring semester role, Concerts Committee’s new executive board is entering uncharted territory this coming school year. Alongside co-director Faiz Haque, Gibbs and the rest of the team have been challenged to drastically alter the traditional Welcome Back Concert held every August. 
“We’re trying to pull something together that’s really interesting and unique from what we’ve seen previously with livestreams and stuff like that,” said Gibbs, a senior majoring in communication. “We’re just trying to make it so that whatever we do is something enjoyable and something maybe different than what we’ve seen over the past few months.”
Tentatively planning to livestream its music events, the committee is working to create engaging and inimitable experiences for students logging on from around the globe. 
Unlike Instagram Live concerts that have become commonplace during the lockdown, Gibbs said that Concerts Committee is brainstorming ways to make the virtual concert experience as interactive and creative as possible for attendees. 
Because events will be online, Concerts Committee is in an unprecedented position to publicize them to a much wider audience than usual, perhaps opening it to not only the USC community but each artist’s fans as well. 
“If the artist wants to post about it, I wouldn’t be mad because then all of their fans can come too,” Gibbs said. “At the end of the day, I just want as many people to enjoy our events as possible.” 
While Concerts Committee hasn’t yet officially confirmed any events, opening up virtual events would be an opportunity to publicize both the Committee and some of USC’s own artists, Gibbs said.
In typical years, Concerts Committee employs a variety of methods to reach students and promote their events, using a mixture of digital and terrestrial marketing strategies, such as social media platforms, email blasts, on-campus promotion and tabling on Trousdale Parkway. However, with campus life disrupted by a virtual semester, the Committee is forced to get creative in its outreach methods.
Ben Kronenberg, the assistant director of marketing for Concerts Committee, acknowledged that his responsibilities this semester will be a far cry from the average school year. He said that the now-typical Instagram Live concert content is overdone, often unengaging and as a result, “disheartening.” He will work closely with his creative teams to find new ways to reach out to and engage students and get people excited about a digital event.
While the future of live shows may currently be uncertain, Gibbs, Kronenberg and the Committee are actively working to provide entertainment and events for USC students. 
“We’re definitely going to try and have some sort of virtual programming, whether that be panels or special smaller events with either student artists or non-student artists,” Gibbs said.
The organization recently teased the opening acts for its Welcome Back event. Partnering with the Black Student Assembly, Concerts Committee announced via Instagram Aug. 10 that its event will feature Kyle Lux and Jordyn Simone, two up-and-coming artists and USC students. 
While the exact format and headliner of the event are yet to be announced, Concerts Committee is working to make sure it’s a virtual music experience like no other. 
Jared Khan, a junior majoring in quantitative biology and an avid concertgoer, recently attended a 100 gecs music festival on the Minecraft platform. He said he enjoyed the novelty of the experiential event, noting that it was “more of an emulation of a real concert versus a passive viewing party.” Khan was also quick to point out that it was not identical to a typical concert experience.
While Instagram Lives are low-budget and more manageable to set up, such interactive events can amass huge crowds and provide ample opportunity for music promotion and merchandise sales. Travis Scott held a similar event on Fortnite, with almost 12 million viewers from around the world in attendance. 
The transition to a digital interface will force the Committee to think outside the box, experiment with new methods of viewer engagement, promote smaller online events and partner with more student artists. However, Concerts Committee views the many challenges of the current virtual-only landscape as an opportunity. 
“Everyone in any role anywhere now has to really learn what resilience is and how to … make the best out of the situation,” Kronenberg said.

Before the coronavirus pandemic, a typical day for Casey Gardner, a senior majoring in theatre, would begin at 7 a.m. As a School of Dramatic Arts student, she used this early morning time to prep costumes, print scripts and warm up before her 8 a.m. acting classes. The rest of her days were occupied with classwork, meeting with scene partners, memorizing lines, a four-hour rehearsal block from 6 to 10 p.m. and often another rehearsal after that. She usually doesn’t make it back home before midnight. 
“It’s a pretty intense day of work,” Gardner said. “Obviously, you’d have to love it.”
However, along with all other students in USC’s many arts- and performance-based majors, Gardner’s day is going to look different this semester due to the current challenges that remote learning presents. The to and fro that filled her days will now mostly take place within her apartment in Los Angeles and although she said that may be disappointing, she’s found ways to adjust. 
While the initial announcement of Project Restart presented a hopeful advance, plans have since changed. Coronavirus cases continue to spike in L.A. County and the University is now recommending that all undergraduate students take their courses from home. 
Dance students are now unable to touch their dance partners, theatre students no longer have elaborate set designs to enhance their narratives, music students must continue to work together in bands — no longer playing their instruments in the same practice rooms — and film students have traded in niche camera equipment for their iPhones. 
Before these changes, Gardner spent Spring 2020 studying abroad at the British American Drama Academy. For eight weeks, she worked one-on-one with her professors and directors to fully immerse herself into her craft. 
“Theatre is such a necessary art to be with and connect with other people,” Gardner said. “[We] bounce ideas off of each other and just try things out.” 
After being abruptly sent home in March, she finished the rest of her semester online. The time difference between London and her home in Kansas was difficult to navigate, but she also noticed the isolation impacting her work. 
“It was pretty disheartening,” Gardner said. “I didn’t necessarily feel as confident in it as I would have if I was able to be in the room and working with other people.” 
The initial uneasiness of shifting a very physical art form to an online platform didn’t stop the creative process entirely, though. Gardner’s class was working on an adaptation of Shakespeare’s play “Cymbeline” and rather than canceling the production, students pulled scenes from the play and performed them over Zoom at the end of the semester. While it was a different experience than how she imagined spending her semester abroad, it pushed the envelope for her creative thinking process, she said. 
“It forced us to be creative in a whole new sense and work toward this kind of modern film or TV realm of acting rather than just theatrical, so that was cool,” Gardner said.
Students in the Thornton School of Music also had to find ways to recreate a collaborative hands-on art form remotely. Maria McMillian, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance, emphasized the importance of collaboration within her cohort.
“The hard thing about music is that it depends so heavily on us being in the same space and playing together in real time,” McMillian said. “You just can’t recreate that online or on Zoom.”
In the week following spring break, McMillian’s professors chose the Acapella app to perform music in groups remotely. Although the app spurred many trivial internet videos back in its 2015 peak, applied to a musical education, it proved relatively effective. 
“It wasn’t terrible,” McMillian said. “It was just different because we had to change our workflow. We had meetings with each other to decide the order of who would record instead of just rehearsing with each other in person.”  
Additionally, Thornton will be launching online programs to support its students for the semester. 
“The School is readying a new online platform for music lessons and a new virtual stage to showcase performances of students, alumni, faculty and Thornton ensembles,” Thorton Director of Communications Evan Calbi said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Thornton is creating digital audio workstation workshops that will be offered to performance students who don’t already have knowledge of the technology.”
However, for some art students, innovative thinking and virtual programs won’t be enough to overcome the accessibility issues that online classes present. 
Alex Policaro, a senior majoring in dance, explained that one of the hardest parts of remote classes was the lack of studio space. While on campus, she had access to the facilities in the Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center, including specialized studios with sprung wood flooring. At home, she used her garage and placed shower pan liners on the floors to mimic the marley flooring, but the changes still took a toll on her body.
“[Last semester] I was dancing out of a garage because it was the largest space that I had,” Policaro said. “I did it, but my body was not having it. My back hurt, and my knees [were hurting].” 
While many artists rely on the physical spaces available on campus, some also count on their respective schools to provide specialized hardware. Daniel Proa, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, noted the financial burden that online courses have presented for film students. 
Last semester he took the “Cinematic Communication” class that is designed to teach principles of cinematography, directing, editing, producing and sound. At the beginning of the semester Proa paid a $300 insurance cost to cover the equipment he would use through the School of Cinematic Arts. After being sent home in March, he no longer had such access to the equipment he paid for. 
“[SCA is] kind of trusting you to already have equipment,” Proa said. “They’re not saying we’re going to give you at least this much [of the $300] for equipment [as a reimbursement] and they’re not letting us borrow or take home anything.”
While Proa had to spend some of his own money, he had to unconventionally repurpose what he had at home. 
“For example, I didn’t have a tripod,” Proa said. “I had to just stack like every single thing that I had in my house to hold my phone up.”
In previous semesters, Proa used to spend considerable time on campus, taking advantage of SCA’s resources. After class, he would go to the school’s labs and use the computers and editing software available to him. Here, he would also have someone to ask questions if he needed help.
“There’s not people helping you step by step in the editing [at home] … I had to figure things out on my own and while that’s kind of our job [to figure things out], we still should get some help,” Proa said.
But for some students, remote instruction and the increased independence that it brings have encouraged the creation of more original work. 
According to Associate Dean of Admissions and Student Services for SDA Sergio Ramirez, SDA has been supportive in its students’ endeavors, supplying a range of remote initiatives to supplement its independent creativity through involvement fairs and panel discussions this semester. 
“[Our] students are very ambitious and entrepreneurial,” Ramirez said. “But the faculty are definitely there to support them in how they reimagine their creative energy … I’m really excited to see what students make out of this experience. Just because we’re not in class or not on campus doesn’t mean we can’t provide and that the students can’t create.” 
For example, after Gardner’s experience performing a play on Zoom, she said she recommends students produce their own shows through Zoom with their peers. 
“Part of the School of Dramatic Arts and a reason why so many students love it is the ability to be creative outside of the classroom,” Gardner said.
For Policaro, adapting to remote learning entails taking advantage of newfound time. When she returned to  Texas in March, she used the two hour time difference between L.A. and Austin by taking extra classes in the morning, allowing her to keep a routine and expand her technique beyond the styles covered in her Kaufman School of Dance courses. 
McMillian has been using the extra time, afforded to her by the lack of extracurriculars, to create music in a more relaxed fashion. Before the pandemic, McMillian only had time to practice for class projects or scheduled live shows. 
“In terms of just having time to sit down at the piano or with my guitar and just mess around without a clear goal, I definitely didn’t have time for that before and now it’s been really nice,” McMillian said.
Although more open-ended, this independent form may take some getting used to, especially with how fundamental sharing one’s art is to the creative process. Proa explained that presenting his films in “Cinematic Communication” over Zoom affected how his work was received.
“I would have liked to be there in person because I could take in everybody’s reactions,” Proa said. “I think that that really helps me as a creator.” 
Ultimately while in-person theatre productions, film screenings, shows and art exhibitions can feel like the focal point of art majors, they’re not always the main motivator for the creation of their work. 
Gardner emphasized the innate passion for storytelling that comes with her acting and explained that she will continue to adapt her craft for a virtual medium. 
“The fact that you can connect with people that you’ve never met and now even more than ever being on Zoom connecting with people across the world just through telling a story I think is really powerful,” Gardner said.

Harboring an ear for music and discipline for personal development, EDM artist and producer Jack Dugan practices a trifecta of mindfulness, music production and Brazillian jiu jitsu to propel his professional career and tackle adversity. 
Conquering the piano and guitar at age seven, the 2020 Thornton School of Music graduate has always been musically inclined. While collaborating with his middle school rock band in his hometown of Bethesda, Md., he identified music as his method of communication and channel for self expression. 
“[Through music], people were able to understand a part of me that I didn’t know how to express through words,” Dugan said, explaining his once shy, reserved personality. 
Because he gravitated the most toward instrumental production, Dugan became hooked on creating EDM in high school.
He showcased his talent as a DJ at tailgates and frat parties at the University of Miami, where he attended before transferring to USC. At the time, Dugan also released a variety of electronic remixes and reboots. His most notable release came in 2016 when he won the Wavo remix competition for Steve James’ “Renaissance.” The remix was soon signed to Ultra Music, according to Dugan’s Spotify.  
For Dugan, music has consistently served as a source of consolation, especially as he grew to question his place in the world and come to terms with his adoption. While he always held a sincere and loving relationship with his adoptive family, constantly contemplating the story behind his adoption led him to an anxious state. 
“I felt lonely and frustrated about not knowing anything at all about my past,” Dugan said. “So I felt, more than anything, that I couldn’t fit in anywhere.”
Yet, his mindset drastically shifted when he discovered the practice of mindfulness at the age of 19. Dugan was inspired by successful music business entrepreneurs who recommended practicing introspection and cultivating mindfulness as mechanisms to make better business decisions. So he downloaded HeadSpace, an app designed to facilitate mindfulness through meditation. 
Dugan also read “The Artist’s Way” by Julia Cameron, which motivated him to keep a daily journal — another tactic used to develop mindfulness and an activity Dugan encourages everyone to try. 
“As I get better at understanding my emotions through journaling and meditation, I am better able to objectify my thoughts,” Dugan said. He argues that learning to perceive thoughts as objects has allowed him to separate himself from the emotions that once controlled him and prevented him from obtaining peace of mind. 
He further argues that practicing mindfulness to achieve peace of mind is key to disassociating from negative thoughts that prohibit people from achieving their true potential, or their most authentic “selves.”  
Dugan said that “people create their sense of self through filtering their past experiences and telling themselves stories about what they’ve been through.” He compares this tendency to “view life through a lens” to a “filter” that is used in music production to warp sound.    
Just as a voice or instrument’s sound may be warped by a musical filter, he said the way we view the world may be contorted by the emotional filters created by our personal experiences. And just as the removal of a musical filter reveals raw sound, eliminating our emotional filters unveils our most authentic selves, allowing us to live up to our greatest individual potential. 
For Dugan, the experience of adoption once shaped his perception of life through a single filter of angst and uncertainty. However, cultivating mindfulness through meditation and journaling has led him to interpret his adoption through new filters of motivation and appreciation. 
He has grown to effectively articulate “an immense amount of gratitude” toward his adoptive family, as they have given him various opportunities he otherwise would not have had. He admits that this shift in perspective has motivated him to make the most of small things.
Dugan’s mindfulness practice was drastically amplified by adjunct professor of music industry Richard Wolf’s “Music and Mindfulness” course at USC. He confesses that Wolf’s class showed him how improving his meditation practice could make him a “better musician, more creative and happier.”
Since musicians naturally gravitate toward sound, anchoring their awareness in the noises of their surroundings allows them to better connect with the world and achieve a deeper meditative state. 
“[Meditation] has given me a much greater sense of appreciation and allowed me to connect deeper with the world through my already developed sonic skills,” Dugan said. 
Highlighting Dugan’s commitment to introspection in his meditative practice, Dugan’s longtime best friend Kyle Sonlin said that being mindful has allowed Dugan to “access a lot of the emotional drive it takes to be so creative.”
Following his yearning for peace of mind, Dugan channels physical energy into activities that promote mindfulness. As an avid practitioner of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, he describes the martial art as “a great way to develop humility and detachment.”
As an artist, he said he believes that mindfulness practice may serve particularly beneficial while on tour.
“It’s pretty difficult to find time to recharge when you’re on a bus. And it’s really important to recharge because you give so much to the crowd every single night,” Dugan said. 
In addition to holding private music production lessons via Zoom, Dugan is currently constructing a new artist project called Quinn Alexander — the name originally given to him by his birth mother. 
Through Quinn Alexander, Dugan strives to capture an authentic story of his adoption. He emphasized that while Quinn Alexander would have been a completely different person — with different experiences, fears and aspirations from Jack Dugan — the two would have shared the same mind and consciousness. 
The project intends to show that “there is something much more to the self than simply the experiences and stories we tell ourselves about our past,” Dugan said. 
He plans to experiment with new orchestral sounds that contrast his previous work. The switch in music style highlights how Quinn Alexander would have held a completely different identity from Jack Dugan. 
“The Quinn Alexander project reminds me of Porter Robinson not because the music sounds similar, but because it feels equally as emotionally driven [rather than] sales driven,” close friend and fellow artist Leah Silberman said. 
The final product of the Quinn Alexander project, which he expects to release in 2021, will represent the most authentic, raw form of Jack Dugan. Producing Quinn Alexander will allow him to get in touch with a higher, purer form of his consciousness by expressing that the “self” is greater than the experiences that people so often assume shape it, he said.

Typically at this time of  year, most discussions about USC’s football team revolve around familiar subjects: Who will be the starting quarterback? How much depth do the Trojans have at running back? How is the team going to fare in conference play?
This year, however, only one question really matters, and fans still have no answer to it: Will there be a college football season at all? 
“It is true that, at this time, we do not have state, county, or university clearance for traditional practices and competitions,” Athletic Director Mike Bohn wrote July 31 in a letter to donors obtained by the Daily Trojan. “Additionally, we have not received any indication about if fans will be permitted to attend home games at the Coliseum this year should the season go forward, and we do not have any timeline for when this decision would be made by public health officials.”
Despite having months to prepare and organize a season, the fate of 2020 college football remains completely up in the air, subject to the unpredictable spread of the coronavirus and the whims of government, NCAA and university officials. This means that gameday experiences unlike any in the history of USC football are approaching — potentially without fans, marching bands or tailgating. 
In light of the circumstances, Roy Nwaisser, a USC alumnus who has famously not missed a USC football game in 27 years — earning him the moniker ‘USC Psycho’ — believes his typical gameday routine of tailgating might no longer be possible. 
“As long as [the coronavirus] is a threat, I don’t know that I will be tailgating at all,” Nwaisser said. “Traditionally when we have tailgates, everyone is in close quarters, we’re eating food, we’re sharing food off of the same table, people are sticking their hands in the same chip dish [and] cooler and pulling out drinks. You really can’t do any of that if you’re social distancing … I’m certainly not going to be turning my tailgate into a COVID party.”
When asked about the prospect of his 27-year attendance streak ending, Nwaisser was less pessimistic, albeit for a different reason. 
“If I miss a game that I choose to miss, then that would be the end of the streak,” Nwaisser said. “But if it’s there is a situation where there is no way to get in because fans aren’t allowed in or there’s just not an availability of tickets or it’s totally out of [my] control, then I don’t think that kills the streak.”
Though his famous run might survive another season, Nwaisser acknowledged that a season restricted to TV screens will be irredeemably lacking the qualities that make the college gameday experience so special. 
“For me, there is still nothing like college football,” Nwaisser said. “I love the atmosphere. I love the band. I love the action. It’s just not the same on TV.” 
Devin Dhaliwal, a junior at USC and lifelong Trojan football fan, shared Nwaisser’s sentiment. 
“From an entertainment and passion perspective, there is nothing that beats college football because you have [students], alumni who have attended the school and graduated and you have the bands, the different fight songs and traditions [and] tailgating throughout campus,” Dhaliwal said. “I think college football just has such a unique energy to it.”
Dhaliwal, who grew up attending USC games with his father, a Trojan alumnus, has recently enjoyed a gameday experience far different from the ones that most fans do. Since joining USC’s marching band, Dhaliwal has gained an appreciation for how much the band contributes to the energy and tradition of gamedays at the Coliseum. 
“We’re there every game from start to finish,” said Dhaliwal, who is majoring in computer science and business administration. “We’re really trying to be positive and support the team as much as we can, and I think by doing that, it sort of sets an example for the rest of the student body and the rest of the stadium to say, ‘Hey, we’re here and we’re going to support our team no matter what happens.’”
Apparently, Dhaliwal is not the only Trojan fan who holds this opinion. 
“I love the band,” Nwaisser said. “I’ve always said, even when the team’s doing horribly, the band still rocks.”
Considering the risks presented by the pandemic and the likelihood that both University Park and the Coliseum will be largely vacant, Dhaliwal has opted to stay home for the fall semester. 
The sense of loss that a missed season will bring is apparent to him. 
“It’s going to be a huge void because that’s something I’ve grown up with my whole life, something I really look forward to sharing with my friends and my family, and it’s not going to be the same, which sucks,” Dhaliwal said. 
Nwaisser, for his part, maintained that he would try to travel to games if possible, but he is still wary of the public health crisis. 
“If things don’t change for the better, I would not feel comfortable [traveling],” Nwaisser said. “But I would do it. The question is will I fly or will I drive. I don’t like the idea of driving to Washington, but I think I don’t like the idea of flying to Washington — with crowded airports and crowded airplanes — even more.”
On the other hand, Charles Myers, a USC alumnus and former season-ticket holder of more than 20 years, is more steadfast in his unwillingness to attend games in person. 
“No,” Myers said. “You’re asking me if I’m going to risk the health of my family for the sake of attending a football game — sorry, no.”
Though Dhaliwal will miss gamedays at the coliseum alongside his fellow band members, the band — led for the 51st straight year by Dr. Arthur C. Bartner — is forging ahead and preparing for the season, no matter what it will look like. 
“If it’s all virtual, it’s all virtual,” Bartner said. “If we can get some kids on campus, that would be great too. But, as you know, some kids are not coming back to campus, so we’re trying to come up with a curriculum where we can go both in-person and virtual.”
Since the coronavirus outbreak, Bartner’s band has been forced to become flexible in its recruitment and preparation. 
Typically, the band recruits approximately 100 new members during summer orientation sessions. This summer, the band has successfully recruited about 70 new members during online sessions. In addition, much of the band’s equipment, such as instruments and uniforms, remains inaccessible. 
Still, despite the challenges, Bartner believes that his band members are unwavering in their commitment.
“What I hear from my recruitment team is that these kids love this band,” Bartner said. “I’m hearing ‘I’m coming back’ or ‘I’m going to join this band … whatever they throw at us, whatever the scenario is, I want to be a part of this band.’”
Because of the length of his tenure at the helm of The Greatest Marching Band In the History of the Universe, Bartner has witnessed first-hand nearly every big-game and time-honored tradition USC football has had to offer. 
But there is one tradition that Bartner will miss most of all if the band is not allowed to perform at games. 
“When we win and the team comes over to the band and we got the rooting section behind us and we play Conquest and we get the player of the game on the ladder and he holds the sword up … that is my favorite moment,” Bartner said. “You got the team, you got the band, you got the rooting section, the Song Girls, the spirit squad and then you got any fan who wants to come over … For a minute and 45 seconds of Conquest you have the Trojan Family all together.”
That sense of unity at Coliseum gamedays isn’t just felt by the marching band’s iconic leader.
“College is different,” Myers said. “There’s a sense of tradition … but also fellowship that just isn’t the same in professional sports or any venue in college sports.”
Myers was pessimistic about how fanless games might affect the environment at the Coliseum. 
“It severs the emotional experience of the nostalgia, the walking the streets, the running into people that you haven’t seen in years or you haven’t seen since last year,” Myers said. “[I had] season tickets for 20 years [and] I’d look behind me, in front of me, on both sides and saw people and watched them get older with me and talk about our kids growing up. You’d lose the heart and soul of [the experience] and it becomes just a game.”
Bartner is still waiting on word from USC’s leadership as to whether or not his band can perform in the Coliseum and at what capacity. According to Bartner, the number of band members allowed to perform at games might be cut by 90%, from 300 performers to 30. Dhaliwal said this reality, combined with no pregame or halftime show, might make football games feel more like basketball games for the band.
Given the uncertainty, Bartner insists on preparing the band not only for the upcoming season but for when a new band director is selected to replace him after his upcoming retirement. 
“I want [the band] to continue to be great [so] that when the new director takes over he’ll have this great band to work with,” Bartner said. “So I’m doing what I can to keep everybody involved and keep [everyone] progressing and improving, and I keep telling everybody that someday we’re going to march pregame … We don’t know when it’s going to happen, but we have to be prepared.”
Bartner reflected that sense of perseverance when he discussed his outlook on the Trojans’ future.
“This is a great university,” Bartner said. “[We’ve] got a great student body, and we’ve got a terrific band … and we’re going to Fight On. I’m a believer in Fighting On, and we’re going to get through this pandemic and come out stronger on the other end and we’re going to win a ton of football games.”
After all, Bartner may be right. But for now, he and USC football fans can only hope for the best — and they may need to adjust to a gameday experience quite unlike anything they’ve ever seen.

Missing campus? While going virtual will remain the norm for students this fall, we’re bringing campus back to you in this month’s streaming guide. All of this month’s recommendations for films and TV shows feature USC’s campus. The majority of these claim to be filmed in other locations, like Harvard, Princeton and the fictitious Middleton University, so you’ll get to see all the places USC can be.

“The Social Network”
Mark Zuckerberg is receiving more media attention in recent days from his sunscreen faux pas and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioning him in Congress, but this film is here to provide a look into his life as a college student while he created Facebook. Although Facebook is not the most popular social media network today, the drama that went into it is well worth viewing. Remember to take the plotline with a grain of salt as Zuckerberg was not involved in the project, even though those close to him helped create the book the film is based on. Other campuses are mixed in throughout the film to replicate Harvard University, but you should be able to recognize one of the lecture rooms in Taper Hall during the note passing scene. 
“How to Get Away with Murder”
Calling law students and thriller fans! Acclaimed lawyer Annalise Keating (Viola Davis) and five of her brightest students become involved in a murder plot filled with twists and turns. The show wrapped up in May of this year, so you are all set to binge the entire 90-episode series. The Student Union and Bovard Auditorium, along with Mudd Hall and the Physical Education Building, can be spotted within the first few episodes and appear in later seasons as well.

Appropriately titled, this film follows the life of 21-year-old college graduate Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) as he tries to figure out what he wants to do with his life post-graduation. His plans, or lack thereof, are interrupted by a seductress about twice his age. Regardless of what year you’re in, the worries and uncertainty that come with the future are relatable for all students. Out of the list, this movie is probably the easiest to spot campus in. Hint: Look for Doheny Library! 
Amazon Prime Video
“Beautiful Boy”
This film follows the haunting story of a father and son’s tumultuous relationship, portrayed by Steve Carrell and Timothée Chalamet. Nic Sheff (Chalamet) is an accomplished student but his battle with addiction takes over his life and alters the course of his future. As you can tell, this movie is one you should emotionally brace yourself for. If Chalamet isn’t your cup of tea, Carrell’s performance will make you reconsider. His acting capabilities go beyond what most of us are used to seeing with his portrayal of Michael Scott on “The Office.” If you enjoy the movie, be sure to check out the pair of memoirs that inspired the film written by Nic and David Sheff, respectively. 
“Legally Blonde”
This is one of two films on this list that you’ll need to pay to view, but with a rental price of $3.99, I couldn’t resist including this classic. The movie follows the journey of Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) on her untraditional path to Harvard Law School. In the movie, Elle serves as president of Delta Nu at California University, inspired by USC’s chapter of the Alpha Nu sorority named Delta Gamma. Watch this movie if you’re in need of a pick me up or simply a fun breakup redemption story. Be on the lookout for Bovard Auditorium!
“Love & Basketball”
Monica (Sanaa Lathan) and Quincy (Omar Epps) are life-long friends turned lovers with the same dream of playing basketball professionally. They both end up playing at USC prior to making it big. As their professional careers take them on different paths, their bond is tested. You’ll become invested and wonder throughout the film if both love and basketball can win. This film also has a $3.99 rental price, but it is well worth the cost.

“Princess Diaries 2: The Royal Engagement”
If you’re looking for a reason to go down memory lane, this is it. This film reminds me of my childhood, as do most of the things found on Disney+. Anne Hathaway is Princess Mia Thermopolis from the make-believe kingdom of Genovia. She is faced with the challenge of finding her prince charming within 30 days to secure her position as queen. She learns of this news immediately after her graduation from Princeton University, which just so happens to actually be Bovard Auditorium.

Sports journalists may be gearing up to report on the 2020 college football season from the best seat in the house: their couch. After inching closer to the television screen and wrapping up play-by-play coverage, they might head to their home office to catch a postgame press conference hosted over Zoom.
Or maybe they are among the lucky few who have been granted press credentials and given the opportunity to squeeze into their own socially distant corner of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum press box with no more than 20 other people, squinting down at the field and catching the red glare of the empty stands that beam back at them. 
Or football might not even happen. 
These are some of the many scenarios that reporters such as Dan Weber of USCFootball.com, a website offshoot of 247Sports that provides news and content directly related to the Trojan football team, are anticipating as they wait for an announcement from the USC Athletic Department that will come … eventually. 
As a veteran football beat writer and former college sports administrator at Northern Kentucky and Xavier universities, Weber is worried not so much about the ability of journalists to report on the games themselves but rather about recreating the game day energy that makes USC football especially stimulating.
“You could cover the game from home, and you’d almost have the same access,” Weber said. “I think the one thing you would miss … is, what is it like in terms of the fans and the access, and what does it sound like and what does it feel like, and you can’t quite get that on television.”
Fifty-seven days before teams were hoping to invite competing schools onto their campus or pack up for a road game, the Pac-12 CEO group approved a conference-only format for football. The Trojans are slated to participate in a 10-game schedule, kicking off the strange season with a familiar and rousing matchup against UCLA.
Following the announcement, USC Athletic Director Mike Bohn released a joint statement with UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond on Twitter expressing their tentative satisfaction with the Pac-12’s confirmation. One point in particularly good graces was the flexibility of the new schedule, allowing the crosstown matchup to be moved from Sept. 26 to Oct. 31 or Dec. 12 should earlier conditions not bode well for the health and safety of athletes and staff.
So are football beat writers racing to register press credentials and already driving to the Rose Bowl to find a good parking spot? No, and they shouldn’t, said Ryan Kartje, the USC beat writer for the Los Angeles Times. 
“It’s tough because I’m not sure that [USC] really knows,” Kartje said. “It’s such a fluid situation, but I have spoken with [Sports Information Director] Tim Tessalone a little bit just kind of hypothetically on what the media situation might look like. I’m still pretty hesitant that it will even matter, because I don’t think there will be a football season.”
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Tessalone wrote that schools’ sports information directors and the media, including the Football Writers Association of America, will accommodate local and state public health guidelines and apply these plans to all fall sports.
“Basically, the goal of SIDs everywhere is to provide the highest quality work environment and proper access to the media, as well as a similar experience whether the media is able to attend games in person, or because of personal health issues, space/access limitations, budget concerns or other reasons, they must do so from elsewhere,” Tessalone wrote.
There is already much speculation as to what this kind of work environment might look like if it is in person. Kartje and Weber both acknowledged that the press box sitting mightily above the gridiron already doesn’t provide much elbow room as it is, and to imagine the capacity being limited to no more than a quarter — ultimately limiting who and what outlets get to report — brings up other discouraging but ultimately critical questions: Are the stadium managers going to let them into the elevator up to the press box one at a time? Does each reporter stand in their own socially equidistant circle? Are photographers and videographers going to be let on the field to document the action? All remains to be seen.
Even with gamedays shaping up to be a distinct divorce from the typical USC football experience, sports journalists have already lamented the lack of coverage that everyone from the casual to the uber-fan enjoys heading into a game.
In another dimension, Weber said he would put his high school football coaching knowledge to work on providing readers with ghost notes from practices, along with a five-to-seven minute analysis of impressions, implications and updates that cover the already limited 20 practice minutes reporters were allowed to observe. So far, the press has only had access to one practice back in March before campus shut down. 
“You’ll still be able to talk to selected players and selected coaches after practice, but it won’t be the same as actually seeing it or being there or being able to change hands there and get your direct impressions from what you’re actually seeing,” Weber said. “I don’t know how that’ll play out but it won’t be the same as what it’s been.”
Despite the in-person uncertainty, Ryan Abraham, founder of USCFootball.com, said he appreciates the University’s increased access and communication as decisions are made.
Additionally, Abraham was able to adjust some of the site’s content output because coaches, staff and players were more available to interview during the most restrictive of the quarantine period.
“You’re still trying to create content, and they’ve made coaches and players available for more long-form stuff,” Abraham said. “I’ve done some live YouTube videos with coaches for, say, 45 minutes apiece… It’s been nice to maybe get the players and coaches in a different environment where instead of, like, three minutes after practice you get them for 45 minutes. You get a real better feel for what’s going on in their lives.”
With a smaller outlet like USCFootball.com, one additional respite from the pandemic-induced sports paucity has been breaking news. From the announcement of different L.A.-based recruits that has USC sitting at No. 7 in the nation for overall 2021 team rankings to the six new assistant coach hires that will round out the Trojans’ arsenal, fans seem to be chomping at the bit for news that looks favorably for USC after the past couple of years, even if it isn’t an announcement about head coach Clay Helton’s status.
But for Kartje, beyond news of the University ending its disassociation with former USC football legend Reggie Bush and the creation of the United Black Student-Athletes Association to combat racial inequity in the Athletic Department, he is careful in predicting whether the news cycle will flourish or hit the wall completely without the guarantee of a live sports schedule.
“We’re kind of at the mercy of whatever USC decides they want to let us do in some regard — not in every regard, but it makes it a lot tougher to actually tell these stories and, you know, to really serve in sort of a watchdog role,” Kartje said. “That element is pretty much impossible.”
For journalists like Kartje and others at large publications, staffers could soon see major ramifications for their daily functions as outlets move on in the possible absence of college football. Kartje could see the Times moving him to report on the NBA or even to join the news desk as the paper tries to keep up with the slew of coronavirus-related developments.
“I have to imagine, you know, especially in the situation that journalism in the economy is — it’s a time that it’s important to show that you’re important, especially when you’re a sports writer and the sport isn’t actually playing, so that is definitely a concern,” Kartje said. “I’d imagine other people in my situation have similar concerns.”
Finding new leads is the hinge of a reporter’s work, which Abraham describes as a “content tree,” where one interview might give rise to four or five different stories. Given the limited review of practices contrasting with the increased time to talk with coaches and players, a story that might’ve been a predictive analysis of offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s Air Raid offense might turn into a deconstruction of remarks that junior safety Talanoa Hufanga made about the cohesion of the Trojan defense.
The other side to creating content is reader engagement, which Weber has gleaned has stayed constant if not improved because of USC’s uncanny ability to attract media attention. Kartje is more cautious to make this claim but recognizes a lasting effect in how national news surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement and the NCAA’s adapting policies on athlete name, image and likeness will change sports journalism.
“You can just see it with conversations about other things about NIL, about, you know, in terms of systematic racism and college athletes kind of taking a role in that,” Kartje said. “So I do think some doors may open in terms of society, how we look at athletes and their role in the full system as far as journalism goes.”
Kartje, along with Abraham and Weber, anticipate that if fans can’t attend games, if the classic Notre Dame-USC rivalry isn’t renewed at the Coliseum this fall and if the stadium goes completely quiet, sports journalism will probably never be the same in the coronavirus’ wake.
“At this point I’m just hoping journalism makes it through the pandemic still intact,” Kartje said. “But I think out of this will, you know, maybe we emerged as a more skeptical media, who is sort of on the lookout a little bit more and maybe, maybe that’s a good thing — I hope. I’m trying to be optimistic when it comes to that stuff in terms of journalism.”

When the USC Athletic Department announced June 23 that it would begin a three-phase plan for student-athletes across six sports to return to campus starting the following day, the United States was months deep in a pandemic with no clear end in sight.
This remains true as ever to this day — and Southern California has emerged as a hotspot in the country’s coronavirus surge. Though the Pac-12 released its full conference-only schedule July 31 with available make-up dates galore, there is hardly any certainty that the season will kick off as planned Sept. 26 — let alone finish.
But with questions endless and answers few and far between, the Trojan football team has been continuing to prepare for a season that might not be. 
“For me personally and as a team, we just have to kind of have the idea that we’re going to play when they say we can,” sophomore quarterback Kedon Slovis said. “And whenever we get called to play, we gotta be ready.”
But what does preparation look like in this aberration that is 2020? 
According to junior safety Talanoa Hufanga, it looks like scheduling workout times, completing daily online wellness check-ins to make sure he’s cleared for that day’s workout and to access facilities and wearing a wristband to gain entry onto campus. Redshirt junior offensive tackle Jalen McKenzie said it’s following what he called a “social distance path” to grab workout gear before heading to the outdoor field. Slovis said it’s increasing the typical number of lifting groups from two to four or five, moving lifting equipment outside, running with social distancing in place, receivers and centers wearing gloves and quarterbacks wiping down balls after each rep.
Oh, and masks. Masks throughout.
“You take your mask off just for water,” Hufanga said July 21. “And then you put your water back down — it’s like, they have officials over there watching and making sure we’re on top of everything … So when they’re taking these types of precautions, I don’t feel nervous or scared being there.” 
Hufanga added that the USC campus, typically buzzing at this time of year with student-athletes attending in-person summer classes, feels like a “ghost town.”
McKenzie, Slovis and Hufanga said the Athletic Department has been effectively enforcing the myriad protocols put in place to prevent a coronavirus outbreak as student-athletes return to campus. But the nature of college sports and campuses makes it essentially impossible to create a completely centralized and isolated bubble similar to those of the NBA in Orlando or the NHL in Edmonton and Toronto as they resume their seasons.
McKenzie said that fear surrounding the coronavirus, though perhaps alleviated due to the protocols and regulations, has not been fully eliminated.
“Essentially, in this frame of time, we’re essential workers. That’s how we’re being treated right now,” McKenzie said July 22. “So, we’re as comfortable as all the other essential workers who have to go back to work [at] this time. So, it’s definitely not like we’re just out there carefree, like nobody’s thinking about it.”
The initial announcement of the phased return plan came four days after the Trojans’ rival just down the I-405 experienced its own difficulties in returning to campus amid the pandemic. According to the Los Angeles Times, 30 UCLA football players met virtually June 18 to create a document requesting third-party oversight outside of UCLA’s athletic department to ensure that coronavirus-related protocol is followed during all football activities. 
According to the Times, the request stemmed from a lack of trust from the players toward the UCLA Athletic Department and stated the school had “perpetually failed” its student-athletes from a health standpoint in the past.
While Slovis didn’t mention UCLA, he said he was pleased with how the Trojans’ return has gone so far.
“I think they’ve done a great job, especially at USC,” Slovis said. “And I can’t speak for other schools — I’ve heard rumors of things that probably haven’t been done as efficiently. But here, I think we’ve done a great job … Things have kind of come together seamlessly. You know, I think I’ve been here for four weeks now, and it’s been a pretty easy adjustment after the first few days.”
Hufanga mirrored that sentiment, praising not only the department’s providing of masks and hand sanitizer but also its awareness of the mental toll the crisis can have on the student-athletes.
“When the pandemic first started, our — the higher-ups, the coaches and the staff — they did a great job of giving us resources and access when it comes to psychologists and making sure our mental health is stable,” Hufanga said. “You know, this is a tough time for everyone. And so for us just to have those kinds of resources and access and then moving forward and then working on to the field and trying to make sure our health is there, I think that was an important part.”
From players to coaches to staff and team personnel, college football teams travel and operate in large quantities, adding to the complexity of carrying out a 2020 season while mitigating the likelihood of a coronavirus outbreak.
However, McKenzie said he believes USC is equipped to deal with the situation, perhaps because of the sheer number of people that can work to ensure the team’s safety.
“Whenever we go anywhere, we do a lot of business trips and a lot of structured work,” McKenzie said. “We have a lot of people, big support teams and all that. So I think we’re geared very well to deal with something like this because we can put people in the right positions to just make things go smoothly.”
But USC is just one of many pieces of the puzzle that must fit together for college football to be carried out successfully this year, and that puzzle has recently become even more complex — especially in the Pac-12. 
On Aug. 2, a group comprising hundreds of Pac-12 football players, self-titled #WeAreUnited, published a letter in The Players’ Tribune requesting that the conference meet a number of demands — including increasing medical coverage, fighting against racial injustice and distributing half of each sport’s revenue among that sport’s respective student-athletes — lest they boycott the 2020 season. 
Three days later, the NCAA Board of Directors announced that every athlete who chooses to opt out of the upcoming season will keep their scholarship, that athletes will not be required to sign coronavirus liability waivers and that schools will be required to cover athletes’ coronavirus-related medical expenses.
But the players had specific demands of their own conference, including “player-approved health and safety standards enforced by a third party selected by players to address COVID-19, as well as serious injury, abuse and death,” as stated in The Players’ Tribune letter. In a press release shortly after the NCAA’s ensuing announcement, the group accused the Pac-12 of “slow-[walking] health & safety.” In the release, members cited their request to meet with the conference immediately regarding their concerns and the conference’s delay in holding those meetings as the Aug. 17 training camp start date approaches. 
According to Sports Illustrated, Commissioner Larry Scott wrote a response to the players Aug. 3 stating that he and the conference would discuss their letter “over the next couple of days” before following up.
“Each day that the Pac-12 delays [its response] puts the players of this movement, it continues to put our health at serious risk,” redshirt sophomore cornerback Chase Williams said in the release.
The players and Scott ultimately had a meeting Thursday, which the players left “discouraged and deeply concerned,” according to a letter from the group written Friday and publicized Saturday. In it, they cited numerous concerns with Scott’s response, including insufficient coronavirus testing, a lack of legal representation for players in meetings, no Pac-12 prohibition of liability waivers and the dismissal of two Washington State football players allegedly over their support of the #WeAreUnited group.
“This needs to be handled with a sense of urgency, compassion, and fidelity to scientific best practices as fall camp begins in 10 days,” the letter, signed by 18 players including Williams, read. “Without a discernible plan and mandates to ensure the health and safety of student-athletes, it is absurd, offensive, and deadly to expect a season to proceed.”
It remains to be seen whether the players and the conference will reach an agreement. By the time this article was sent to press Sunday, there had been no further developments.
The Players’ Tribune letter came 46 days after USC student-athletes formed the United Black Student-Athletes Association in an effort to push the Athletic Department to better support its Black student-athletes as well as fight against racial injustice both within USC Athletics and beyond. Among the UBSAA’s 12 demands in its initial statement was that the Athletic Department weigh the voices of student-athletes regarding their return to campus amid the pandemic and hold consistent dialogue to directly hear their concerns.
“We were hoping for transparency … We just were hoping that it wasn’t like we’re just getting all these decrees and rules and not learning anything about it or not having any input on it, not knowing what’s going on really,” said McKenzie, who holds a position as one of four official liaisons of the UBSAA. “So I think they’ve done a good job of that — keeping us in the loop.”
While the negotiations between the #WeAreUnited group and the conference play out, Hufanga, McKenzie, Slovis and many other Trojans are on campus, getting ready for a season that — if it even takes place — will be unlike any other in the history of college football. 
Despite all the social distancing measures put in place, Slovis said that being away from the team since spring ball was shut down March 12 — the day after the team’s first and only practice — may have helped improve the team’s chemistry and camaraderie.
“I think that made everyone have a renewed appreciation for the game and for each other,” Slovis said. “It’s a grind when you’re in spring ball and during the season, but when you kind of get it taken away from you, you really miss it. And I think a lot of guys came back missing just being with each other and having that opportunity.”
McKenzie said the team was looking forward to getting back together but that the feeling around campus is still quite different than in past offseasons.
“Everybody’s excited to see everybody and get back to seeing your teammates and all that,” McKenzie said. “But it’s still — it’s pretty serious around USC, to be honest. It’s kind of eerie.”
Eerie — that may be the most accurate term to describe campus these days, along with “ghost town.” The upcoming season could be described with many others: irregular, unpredictable, fragile, hypothetical.
There are far too many moving parts to foresee what will happen in college football or in the Pac-12 this fall. So as the Trojans continue to gear up for what will be at least an anomaly and at most nothing, they do so knowing that it could all slip away at a moment’s notice.
“We all have our concerns … At any point, I feel like our season could be in jeopardy,” Slovis said. “I trust our administration and our medical staff to kind of take care of that. But there’s just so much we don’t know about this virus … Who knows? Maybe there’s a vaccine soon. We’ll see.”

In just about every way, this won’t be a normal semester for anyone in the USC community. Athletics are no exception, and that’s not just because the football schedule will exclude Notre Dame for the first time since World War II.
Tailgating? Wouldn’t bet on it. Fans in the stadiums? Unlikely. Games taking place at all? Far too early to tell, but there’s no guarantee — no matter what the schedule says. 
There is a multitude of questions regarding whether fall sports will be played this year. Administrators are forced to consider not just the economic necessity and logistical feasibility of safely carrying out a 2020 season but also the ethics of taking such a risk in the first place. 
We’re in the middle of a monthslong pandemic that is now hitting Southern California hard. If not done strategically and with health at the absolute forefront of decision making, playing any sport this fall will put not just the health of student-athletes, coaches and team personnel at risk but also that of the surrounding South Central community. Universities across the country are not incubated from the neighborhoods that surround them, meaning every NCAA-affiliated event carried out carelessly could endanger residents whether they are fans or not.  
Most people across the sporting landscape have concerns about the feasibility of safely carrying out a fall sports season. Almost all are hoping there’s a way to make it happen. Both statements apply to us. 
So, until we’re all told there won’t be college sports this semester, the Daily Trojan sports team will continue to bring you as close to your typical fan experience as we can with the resources available to us, even if much of that work will be done remotely.
We know that USC Athletics is a major aspect of campus life for students, identity for alumni and pride for fans. USC Athletics is a brand, one that plays a central role to so many members of the University community. The term “Trojan Family” is perhaps best on display amid the backdrop of USC sports, and that’s a reality we don’t take lightly.
At the same time, it is evident that this brand is part of a flawed system reflecting the plague of systemic racism so deeply ingrained in our society. The student-athletes that make college sports function are using their platforms to say as much — and we should listen.
The NCAA has long been known as an organization that exploits its student-athletes by reeling in hundreds of millions of dollars for predominantly white administrators, commissioners, athletic directors and coaches without directing a dime of that money toward the student-athletes generating its revenue. This dynamic is especially prevalent in college football and basketball — sports that make the most money and comprise the highest percentage of Black student-athletes.
Now, to add on, student-athletes are having to fight for uniform coronavirus prevention protocols and medical coverage from the NCAA during a pandemic that disproportionately affects the Black community.
College athletes have said as much. A group of Pac-12 football players wrote a letter in the Players’ Tribune Aug. 2 stating they will opt out of the 2020 season if the NCAA does not remedy these shortcomings. Student-athletes at USC formed the United Black Student-Athletes Association in June to demand that the Athletic Department better support its Black student-athletes and actively fight racial injustice. 
It’s our responsibility to tell these stories. It’s our responsibility to highlight and celebrate the achievements of Black student-athletes, both on and off the field, that are too often taken for granted. It’s our responsibility as journalists at USC to shed light on how college sports are not a vacuum outside of society but rather part of an inherently unequal hierarchical system.
The Black Lives Matter movement has firmly ingrained itself in athletics, and that cannot and should not be undone. The work begun by Colin Kaepernick and carried on by Eric Reid, LeBron James and countless others has made a profound impact on sports, and athletes on both the professional and collegiate stage are continuing that today.  
We want to look at the big picture when reporting on our student-athletes. All of us love sports, but that doesn’t mean the system providing us with such rich and entertaining moments is or has ever been anything close to perfect. The student-athletes who make you proud to call yourself a Trojan are reckoning with a sporting landscape that doesn’t prioritize their equity. 
This is our promise to reflect these complex truths in our reporting. This is our promise to improve upon our regrettable lack of diversity among our staff and our columnists to uplift the voices that we have historically undercovered.
The Daily Trojan is a completely independent, student-run platform, and it is our job to provide a voice to our local community and student body. This means increasing profiles that highlight the achievements and contributions on and off the field of the Black student-athletes in our community, dedicating ourselves to covering social justice issues within USC Athletics and the wider world of sports and holding the Athletic Department accountable to follow through with its initiatives to fight for racial justice both within Trojan athletics and beyond.
Tradition is everything to USC, but change is demanded for a reason. These are just some of the many ways we can and must listen to the voices — especially those of color — in our community and help do our part in effecting lasting, tangible change. 
This is a moment when we must collectively understand that acknowledging systemic injustice without actively working to dismantle it is simply not enough.

It took 108 years for the Daily Trojan to create a position dedicated to diversity and inclusion. 
Moreover, it took 108 years for us to acknowledge the undoubted truth that Black lives matter. This is not a number I am proud of, but nonetheless, there is crucial work that needs to be done now. 
Despite thinly veiled performative progress, the shape of our society hasn’t changed much since the Daily Trojan published its first issue in 1912. The same evils of white supremacy, racism and bigotry permeate this nation; they are arguably as prevalent as ever, with or without mobs draped in the white-clad uniforms and pointy hoods. 
Many journalists go into the field thinking they will somehow lead the charge to eradicate these issues while causing just the same degree of harm in the same breath. This is part of an outdated notion that we, as journalists and allies, serve as the “voice to the voiceless.”
I’m here to tell you that giving a “voice to the voiceless” is not part of the job and never should have been in the first place. It implies that marginalized communities need white saviors to speak on their behalf and that without these saviors to shine a light on them, these communities are powerless and relegated to the margins of invisibility. These communities do not need those with privilege to overstep and insert themselves in conversations. Rather, they need support; they need people to step out of their ivory towers to realize that the system that has been built to benefit them oppresses others and then work to actively mitigate that disparity. 
Amplification, accountability and action make up the bare minimum that allies can do. Even then, newspapers, including the Daily Trojan, have failed to reach those standards. The Los Angeles Times editorial page once published a piece in favor of Japanese internment; The New York Times, on June 3, published an op-ed written by Sen. Tom Cotton that called for military force against protesters. 
At the Daily Trojan, our Spring 2017 sexual assault supplement’s cover featured an illustration of black hands grabbing white legs. We have circulated stories with photos that blindly exploited the pain of Black women, excluded marginalized groups in our coverage and took our staffers of color for granted. Even as it stands right now, our newsroom and its leadership are predominantly white. 
This semester, our diversity and inclusion team will lead several initiatives to remedy the Daily Trojan’s past failures and palpably work toward a more inclusive present and future. Although these initiatives will not make up for the harm the newspaper has inflicted on marginalized communities, they will assure that the Daily Trojan moves forward with a commitment to upholding harm-reductive, equitable and anti-racist practices. 
In September, our team will be releasing the paper’s first diversity staff report. This report, which will be published for everyone to see, will present our staff demographic breakdown with regard to race, ethnicity, sexuality, socioeconomic status, record of disability, gender identity and more. This report aims to indicate which groups make up the majority of our newsroom, which communities we are leaving out and how we can improve our outreach efforts to include and amplify more voices in our content and in our staff. 
Diversity, however, does not and should not stop at a general membership level. At the Daily Trojan, we have only two Black editors and a majority-white management team on our Fall 2020 masthead. Moving forward, we plan to fast-track Black staffers to assistant positions that will lead to senior editor roles. 
Amplification, accountability and action make up the bare minimum that allies can do. Even then, newspapers, including the Daily Trojan, have failed to reach those standards.
In terms of content, the Daily Trojan will be conducting coverage reports of our daily stories to ensure that we are representing all members of the student body, especially communities we have historically neglected. We will be prioritizing stories from Black students, Indigenous students and students of color this semester and every semester to follow. 
We commit to holding ourselves accountable; therefore, we will be conducting editor evaluations throughout the semester in case they are failing to lead their staffers adequately due to the creation of a hostile work environment. Additionally, to ensure our writers’ voices are maintained and preserved, we will be conducting a more inclusive editing process. This entails having feedback to writers resemble more of a dialogue and less stripping away parts of a piece that are important to our writers at a given editor’s whim. 
We will also conduct diversity and inclusion workshops to cover topics such as empathetic and non-extractive reporting, the importance of minimizing harm, avoiding trauma pornography and fault lines in our coverage and newsroom accountability. These workshops will be mandatory for all editors and staffers to attend. 
These initiatives are only the beginning, and they are intended to set the foundation for what the position of diversity and inclusion director will entail in the future.
Confronting racism is not an issue that belongs solely to Black and brown communities. If we want to wholly eradicate this evil, we need to hold ourselves accountable for what we have been failing to do. For journalists, this means having reckonings within our newsrooms. It means realizing that our position in society is not to overstep and be a “voice to the voiceless” but rather to amplify the voices that have already been speaking out. It is our responsibility to tell the truth, to speak out when it is necessary — not just when it is trending in the news cycle — and to always conduct equitable, honest reporting. 
Most of all, we need to look inward and realize that we are no one’s saviors, but merely allies in a long fight against all forms of bigotry.

The pandemic has affected all aspects of higher education: From the transition to remote learning to the Spring 2020 options surrounding pass/no pass grading and credit policies, discussions about what the next academic year will hold have demonstrated the importance of prioritizing students’ needs.
These conversations highlight the need to ensure flexibility and further understanding for all students at USC, and incoming transfer students are no exception. USC must prioritize actions geared toward easing the newly matriculated transfer student body’s adjustment to the University, especially considering many will not be on campus. 
Coming into USC, transfer students are already at a disadvantage with regard to adapting to a new environment. In addition to shouldering the complications of remote learning and the pandemic, transfer students must also learn the inner workings of a new institution while navigating what has been labeled a “second freshman year.” 
According to a 2019 study cited in Teaching in Higher Education, transfer students who take all classes online have a much lower retention rate than non-transfers. 
This research suggests that transfer students who take classes online may feel even more isolated from the campus community. As a result, these students do not feel as comfortable reaching out for help.
In addition to online learning, the multiple challenges transfers experience are only exacerbated by the coronavirus. Now, transfer students face the added struggle of “losing” another semester — of which there are already very few — that otherwise would have been spent forming in-person connections and reaping the fruits of the on-campus experience. 
It is true that without the benefit of in-person interaction, incoming transfer students must be proactive in seeking out their own opportunities. However, it is up to the University to ensure that those opportunities are made available and accessible. 
USC should implement initiatives to ensure that newly matriculated transfer students have the resources necessary to academically and socially succeed at the University. These initiatives should ease the transition for the transfer student body in all aspects of university life without lumping transfer students together with incoming first-years. 
One useful initiative might be peer advising, an opportunity that could be clearly marketed and distributed to incoming transfer students. Such an initiative could take the form of student admission ambassadors having virtual check-ins with new transfers on a voluntary basis.
These individualized weekly check-ins could be centered around transitioning to USC during the pandemic, as questions about USC should not just be limited to orientation.
Additionally, campus organizations should work more intensively to recruit transfer students throughout Fall 2020. Incoming transfer students may have uncertainties about what getting involved in clubs and extracurriculars during the school year will look like, especially since these programs will be held mostly online, or they may not be aware of the vast opportunities for extracurricular involvement at the University at all. Student organizations should work to actively combat this confusion by focusing recruitment efforts at least partly on transfer students.
For instance, campus organizations could work with the Office of Admissions to engage new transfer students with the option of signing up for email newsletters. These newsletters would contain information on application processes and introductory information so that transfer students are made aware of these opportunities.
Yet implementation of these initiatives cannot just focus on easing the social transition. Instead, a primary focus of concern should be how the administration can support transfer students in their studies. 
For instance, allowing transfer students to have classes taken at other institutions count for all eight General Education requirements could be of great benefit in the long run. Many transfer students may have already taken courses that meet all the GE requirements at their former schools due to institutional requirements. However, due to USC’s policy mandating transfer students to take two GE courses at USC, these students are forced to decide which courses they want to count for GE requirements and which GE categories they would like to take again. 
With this policy amended, transfer students have the opportunity to take more major classes or electives that they are interested in. This is much more valuable given that transfers would be able to spend their time and resources at USC in ways more productive for their academic goals. 
For academic advisers, ensuring the academic success of transfer students might mean adapting to a more informal means of guidance beyond required checklists. This could mean reaching out to transfer students about how the academic transition is going online and directing them toward specific virtual resources as needed.
To be sure, the burden of ensuring transfer students’ success is not completely up to USC. Rather, part of this responsibility lies with transfer students themselves, who must take initiative to communicate with their advisers, peers and professors while learning remotely.  
Regardless, transfer students must not be left out of the conversation when it comes to how USC can ensure the success of its students during this pandemic. Transfer students are an integral part of the USC community and it is imperative that USC treat them as such.

“It is better for all the world if, instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind… Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”
The quote above does not come from a fringe eugenics text or radical manifesto; rather, it comes from the Supreme Court of the United States. The case in question, Buck v. Bell from 1927, legalized the sterilization of people deemed “unfit” for society — people with disabilities or people presumed to have disabilities. The ruling has never been overturned at the federal level. The Nazis even cited Buck v. Bell in their defense during the Nuremberg trials when they were tried for atrocities inspired, in part, by the ideals of former USC president Rufus B. von KleinSmid.
Until June 11, 2020, USC continued to tacitly endorse rhetoric that deemed Black and Indigenous people and people of color as well as people with disabilities unfit for higher education. Two years after Undergraduate Student Government’s public call for USC to rename the Von KleinSmid Center, I was encouraged to see USC finally taking action. I scanned the announcement email one, two, three times. I was sure that I had missed their acknowledgement of von KleinSmid’s legacy within disability eugenics. 
It wasn’t there. In fact, disabled students were conspicuously missing from a long list rattled off in the email of groups of underserved students who have long-merited cultural spaces on campus to call their own, despite the many conversations I had with administrators in which they assured me that establishing a cultural space for disabled students was a priority for the president and senior leadership. The email amounted to the erasure of disabled students, both from history and the present.
By contrast, von KleinSmid’s legacy lives on. With USC’s intimate ties to eugenics policy, our University was undeniably designed to serve those favored by organizations such as von KleinSmid’s Human Betterment Foundation. These definitively white and distinctly non-disabled students set the standard for courses, degrees, exams, architecture, admissions procedures, health care, housing, transportation and virtually every other aspect of higher education.
Today, one in five university students nationwide who live with disabilities quickly learn that universities are literally not built for them. To succeed as a student with disabilities, you must seek “accommodations,” a word that implies an undue burden on the institution’s part to allow you to grace their hallowed grounds. 
“Accommodations,” though well-intentioned and legally compliant, are a symptom of systemic issues plaguing institutions like USC. I spent my last year at USC in meetings with administrators to address the countless inaccessible structures, courses and policies as USG’s Director of Accessibility Affairs. As I have invisible disabilities, administrators were caught off-guard by my advocacy. I most frequently got asked one of two questions: “What does ‘that’ [accessibility] mean?” and “How did you get ‘into’ accessibility?”
While it’s true that “accessibility” is a term with many uses, the word has been inextricably linked to disability rights for decades. It is unacceptable that any administrator making decisions on behalf of the student body should wield such power over the student experience without a strong foundation in accessible policies. It is even more inexcusable for any administrator to not be “into” accessibility. Accessibility is not a special interest or a benevolent gift to students with disabilities — it is a human right.
One offense, in particular, encapsulates what I understood to be USC’s stance toward accessibility: The Title IX office (now the Office of Equity, Equal Opportunity, and Title IX), previously housed under the Office of Equity and Diversity, which protects the interests of protected classes of students (including disability), is inaccessible. In other words, you must seek accommodations to access the office built to protect you from discrimination. 
Despite meeting with campus administrators and passing a public resolution in USG calling for its relocation, the University has made no public effort to rectify the situation. Even more damning, USC settled a lawsuit in March regarding inaccessibility at USC Hotel. Perhaps they are waiting for a lawsuit that will cost them more than $4,000 and nine hotel rooms to promote widespread accessibility; maybe they never will.
Out of naive disbelief, I replied to the June 11 email asking for the administration to make a public acknowledgement of disabled students with regard to von KleinSmid’s legacy. I received an email from a senior official thanking me for my advocacy and assuring me that disability would be a part of conversations moving forward. Once again, I replied, reiterating that the administration could take immediate, meaningful and cost-effective action by merely acknowledging their omission of disabled students. I received no response. 
USC’s stated commitment to equity means very little in the face of its silence on disability rights. We cannot begin to dismantle white supremacy without acknowledging the intimate link between ableism and anti-Blackness. In examining the Department of Public Safety and the Los Angeles Police Department’s roles on our campus, we also cannot neglect the fact that half of all police brutality victims have disabilities. Though their disabilities are often forgotten, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray, Elijah McClain, Tanisha Anderson and Deborah Danner are just some of the Black disabled folks who have been killed by police in recent years. 
While renaming VKC is a victory for the generations of Black students, Indigenous students and students of color as well as disabled students who were forced to sit in that building knowing its namesake and advocated for their elimination, it is long overdue and incomplete. The administration’s inaction on the issue of disability rights shows that their equity is driven more by social compliance than genuine intent. 
USC has an obligation to prove it is genuinely committed to proactive equity by celebrating disability as part of the diversity it proudly touts on brochures. To start, USC would do well to acknowledge our existence.

While disappointing news for many, allowing undergraduate students from around the world to congregate on a compact, metropolitan campus is understandably illogical. Los Angeles remains a global coronavirus hotspot. In early July, the University reversed its earlier decision to hold a hybrid semester and announced that the majority of undergraduate classes will be held primarily online. 
USC has been forced to work fast and come up with a social distancing-approved alternative semester for nearly 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, the University’s new contingency plan for the fall semester recommends that students participate in classes remotely and reconsider living on or near campus to reduce population density. 
Provost Charles Zukoski mentioned in his July 1 email that efforts have been made to improve the virtual learning experience, citing the creation of a new portal that will act as a “virtual quad” to keep students engaged and socially active. However, USC has yet to prove that it will provide adequate financial support to its students, many of whom will be learning and working from home again. 
The Financial Aid Office is currently recalculating and redistributing aid packages based on changes in students’ housing plans following the announcement of an online semester. There are many factors to consider — many upperclassmen have already signed year-long leases with local housing management companies, and some student-athletes, housing-insecure and international students will have no choice but to live in on-campus housing. Dorms and dining halls are operating at an extremely limited capacity and even students who can attend classes from home may still encounter unprecedented expenses.
USC said that it will offer an up to $4,000 per semester “Living-at-Home” scholarship to undergraduates who would have otherwise received financial assistance for room and board. Additionally, students who would have lived in on-campus housing have the ability to completely cancel their housing contracts and be refunded full amounts of what they’ve already paid.
Although housing will be extremely limited, the University plans to honor current housing contracts once it receives approval from the L.A. County Department of Public Health. Due to public health restrictions, only one student is permitted in each bedroom and the county is requiring the University to maintain a quota of vacant rooms in the case that they are needed for quarantining. 
Campus itself will essentially be a ghost town and many student study spaces, such as libraries, will be completely closed or available by appointment only. Of the students who are permitted to stay in on-campus housing, financial aid packages will be increased to the maximum amount based on need.
Students who secured off-campus leases are also in a difficult predicament. USC Housing groups on Facebook are currently flooded with posts by tenants trying to sublease or re-let their apartments and bed spaces. However, the supply far outweighs the demand, and many students will inevitably be stuck paying for a spot that they may not even be living in. For this reason, the Office of Financial Aid has asked students to submit documentation of their rental and lease agreements in order for them to disburse the maximum amount of aid based on financial need — essentially the equivalent of the “Living-at-Home” scholarship for students who still are paying for non-USC housing and won’t be living with parents or relatives.
While the Financial Aid Office has done their best to soothe the influx of concerned students and parents by releasing statements detailing the additional aid that will be applied to accounts, it is imperative that aid statements are also tailored to each student’s unique circumstances. For example, many students rely on on-campus jobs and work-study positions to pay for tuition and rent, but job opportunities will obviously be limited or nonexistent this semester. Students and their families may also be more financially vulnerable due to job loss during the pandemic and such consequential factors ought to be taken into account. 
It is nearly impossible for the University to account for all of the learning discrepancies that exist between in-person and online classes. In the event that students’ academic progress is hindered by their inability to connect remotely, USC is offering a scholarship opportunity that would cover the cost of two free online classes during the summer 2021 instruction period so they can catch up. 
However, this solution does not necessarily address the students who may earn a passing grade in an online class but suffer from a severely diminished quality of learning. While the University also aims to expand technical support for students dealing with connectivity issues, the details of the plan have yet to be announced. 
The number of potential problems with the upcoming semester are staggering to say the least, but there is only so much that USC can do. While there are many things to criticize about the University’s fall plans, it is certainly safe to say that they, like the rest of us, are trying their best during difficult, unpredictable, and certainly unprecedented times. Now, if only they would try harder to reduce tuition rates.

Students returning for the fall semester will face a slew of challenges when classes resume. For those returning to campus, the looming threat of the coronavirus will hang over virtually every decision they make. Those who opt to attend online classes while staying home will face the threat of the virus along with a unique set of challenges that come with attending class remotely. 
In addition to these hardships, students will be tasked with shouldering the burden of a national crisis unprecedented in scale. Unfortunately, USC has shamelessly decided to pile onto it rather than alleviate its students’ burden, maintaining a previously announced 3.5% tuition hike for the upcoming academic year. 
USC is no stranger to shameless behavior — any student or Trojan alumnus knows this much. The seemingly never-ending headlines regarding rampant criminality and willful ignorance within the University’s top ranks speak for themselves. Still, the University’s decision to raise tuition stands out in its overt indifference to the well-being of its students. The hike is indefensible and runs counter to the University’s virtuous rhetoric amid the pandemic.
In April, the University justified its tuition hike in a statement emphasizing the “reality” that USC found itself in, a reality in which the costs of running the University increased while the ramifications of the pandemic meant increased spending on health expenditures and financial assistance. That is all well and good, but USC’s statement failed to acknowledge a coexisting reality, that of its top executives’ exorbitant salaries. 
President Carol Folt’s annual base salary is $1 million. If the base salary of previously disgraced USC deans are representative, then USC’s academic deans and top executives are making upwards of $600,000. In response to the pandemic, the University announced a 20% pay cut for Folt and a 10% pay cut for USC’s senior leadership. Though the University might hope that the cuts speak to the selfless nature of USC’s leadership, they instead speak to its greed and dissociation from reality. 
Folt will still make at least $800,000 after her pay cut while USC foots the bill of her new $8.6 million Santa Monica residence (although this purchase represents a downsizing from the previous, more expensive president’s property). Assuming the aforementioned salary of USC’s senior leadership is accurate, not a single member of the university’s top brass will fall out of the top 1% of earners in Los Angeles after their pay cuts. 
The wealth of USC’s alumni must not be forgotten, either, and nowhere is this wealth greater than in the pockets of Rick Caruso, chairman of USC’s Board of Trustees. As his title suggests, Caruso is one of the most influential figures in USC’s senior leadership, and his fortune could make up for USC’s pandemic-induced operational shortfall at least 11 times over. 
Simply put, USC’s leadership cannot cry wolf and point to its own financial hardships in light of the obscene levels of wealth it has at its disposal. This justification is more than just weak; it is laughable. The aforementioned figures, coupled with nearly $20 million in federal relief and a $5.7 billion endowment, make the school’s tuition hike inexcusable. 
USC tends to cast itself as a force for social good in the United States and the local L.A. area. According to its mission statement, USC provides public leadership in areas such as economic development and social welfare while playing a major role in the development of southern California and the United States. 
In Folt’s April State of the University address, this self-aggrandizing rhetoric was echoed, and the president made sure to emphasize that USC’s students were in her thoughts.
“Above all, we want to make sure that all our students continue to dream big and act boldly,” Folt said. “You are needed more than ever […] and we’re going to work with you to make your USC experience rewarding and successful in the face of so much uncertainty.”
The idea that President Folt can reconcile this sentiment with the University’s tuition hike is inconceivable. She is lying through her teeth — telling students that USC cares about their suffering while simultaneously bleeding them of as much tuition money as possible.
The racial disparities that will be exacerbated by the tuition increase cannot go unmentioned. According to the NAACP’s Young Adult Committee, such increases could have disproportionate effects for Black students, who default on student loans at five times the rate of their white peers. 
Following the killing of George Floyd, Folt issued a statement in which she affirmed USC’s “call to action” to deal with racism. She also acknowledged the disproportionate lack of access to care the Black community has faced during the pandemic. Considering the circumstances, Folt is either oblivious to the disproportionate harm USC’s tuition hike will likely inflict on its Black students or she simply does not care.
Nevermind the fact that more than half of all U.S. college students can no longer afford to pay their tuition. Nevermind the fact that the quality of USC students’ education will decline just as the dollars paid for it increase or the fact that other universities comparable to USC, such as Georgetown University, have frozen and even reduced their tuition because of the suffering brought on by the pandemic.
It is apparent that in the minds of USC’s leadership, flowery statements akin to inspiration porn are the answers to students’ woes over effective, tangible action. 
Correction: A previous version of this article contained a misleading fact regarding President Carol Folt’s residence purchased by USC. Folt’s $8.6 million Santa Monica home was a downsizing from the previous president’s residence. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Though it may seem that the world could greatly benefit from some good news these days, USC’s optimism about resuming in-person operations in the fall, albeit recently abandoned, was always dicey. Now, the time has come for the University to pay the piper for this unbridled positivity. By waiting until July 1 to officially announce that the fall semester would be held almost entirely online, USC has played a major role in locking students into now-obsolete leases with various off-campus housing agencies for the entirety of Fall 2020, perhaps the entirety of the academic year for some.
In the spirit of bright-eyed and bushy-tailed enthusiasm, USC decided to remain optimistic about in-person instruction continuing throughout the fall despite the growing threat of the pandemic. Although they made no direct promises, on June 2 President Carol Folt sent an email to the USC community stating, “We are planning for an in-person fall semester for students beginning on August 17, 2020.” 
Almost exactly one month after this announcement was made, on July 1, as the number of coronavirus cases in California intensified, Provost Charles Zukoski sent out a very different email that read, “While not what we hoped, we are now recommending all undergraduates take their courses online, and reconsider living on or close to campus this semester.” He prefaced this statement by mentioning the problems that this late news poses to those living in off-campus housing: “We know some of you have July 1 deadlines for leases off campus — so we wanted to get this information to you to help with your decision-making.” 
Now, many of the 70% of students who live off campus are faced with the challenge of deciding whether or not to terminate their leases due to this switch. The issue with holding onto the positive mindset for so long is that many of those who now wish to cancel their leases are already stuck in them. 
The positive approach touted in Folt’s June 2 announcement may have momentarily quelled the anxieties of many students and families about coming back to campus, but this was at the expense of creating delayed financial concerns. Though she urged all those concerned to “remain nimble,” the confidence she showed in the school’s reopening via this announcement, heightened by its juxtaposition with the utter uncertainty and chaos of this pandemic, may have prompted even the most reasonable students to cling on to their off-campus housing leases.  
After all, it is plausible that when an established and even well-reputed institution offers people any degree of certainty and light in a time when both of those things are especially scarce, some people become more inclined to accept them as valid. If the school was willing to effectively bet on the best possible academic outcome of the coronavirus with student and faculty Fall 2020 rent money, then they should also be ready to settle that bet if they lost — and they did lose. 
In response to the new issue posed by off-campus housing, the school has very generously offered an FAQ webpage for non-university housing with one paragraph of legal advice for those students who are now stuck in their leases. As though this were not already more than enough help for the students wondering how they are going to make ends meet in the fall, the bottom of the drop-down bar with the single paragraph of comprehensive legal advice comically reads, “We strongly recommend contacting an attorney before taking steps to terminate any lease.” 
USC really is the gift that keeps on giving. If the school really wanted to help these students in any tangible way, they would offer them some individualized legal help or at least help to cover some of those costs. It is likely that the students most financially harmed by the school’s delayed decision to close in-person operations are also the ones who cannot so easily afford the legal fees involved in getting out of a tough lease agreement. 
Ultimately, the University bet on itself in the fight against the coronavirus, which is a commendable move. However, as is the case with any wager, they ought to be ready to assume the costs of their loss. As far as off-campus housing is concerned, this looks like personalized legal advice, compensation and, of course, a very thorough FAQ page — the latter of which is thankfully the only one of the posited solutions covered to date. As far as moral action is concerned, it is more important to remain realistic than optimistic and most important to remain just. Hopefully, the school moves to make things right.

Following posts on the @black_at_usc Instagram account detailing racial misconduct by then-President of the Undergraduate Student Government Truman Fritz, a petition with more than 1,500 signatures called for his impeachment. Former Senator Isabel Washington also resigned following the dissemination of crude text messages she sent. Additionally, after allegations of complicity in incidents of racial misconduct and calls for impeachment, Vice President Rose Ritch recently resigned. 
This sudden turnover in USG reinvigorated a long-running dialogue questioning if USG adequately represents the entire student body. 
Although these resignations may have been the first step in coming to terms with the failures of USG, they are by no means a long-term solution. In order to sustain meaningful change past resignation, USG must enact change within its organization, at its very core, and come to terms with its history of exclusion and lack of representation. However, it is also up to the student body to vote and continue to hold its leaders accountable. 
In many ways, the problems of USG are simply a microcosm of the United States government. In the 2018 midterm elections, only 36% of voters ages 18 to 29 cast a vote. With even more dismal numbers, the 2020 USG presidential election voter turnout was just under 24%. Young voters often attribute their disinterest in voting to their feelings that voting is an ineffective way to bring about change or their lack of knowledge about the voting system. 
Analysts find that young people feel less invested in local elections, despite the fact that local leaders are essential to making the day-to-day decisions that directly impact the community. 
At USC this is no different, as the USG president acts as the bridge between the student body and administration, spearheads student initiatives and leads the executive branch of USG.  Students should certainly want to choose who holds a position with so much power. 
Abstaining from voting, even at the university level, sets forth a continual cycle of dissatisfaction and lack of engagement. Although increased voting can lead to a more representative candidate, it can only do so much if there is no diversity on the ballot to begin with.
From 2006 to 2014, no women ran for the position of USG president — a fact so astonishing that the Los Angeles Times wrote a piece in 2014 pondering why USC had such few female leaders compared to other student governments. To put it in perspective, six women served as student body presidents at UCLA during this same timeframe. It was not until the 2015 election that USG President Rini Sampath and Vice President Jordan Fowler became the first all-women ticket to win the election in the school’s history. 
USG did not just lack gender diversity in elections; from 2006 to 2014, few people of color were elected and almost all of the elected presidents were members of  Greek life.  In 2014, out of all the men that ran for president, only one was not involved with Greek life. 
In 2017, Sen. Daniel Million resigned from his position, stating that as one of only two Black men in USG, he did not feel welcome and witnessed unfair hiring practices and judicial processes throughout his tenure. 
It is easy to point out that all of these things happened years ago and ask what relevance it holds today. These issues did happen with different people at the helm of USG. That being said, with the events surrounding the calls for Fritz’s subsequent resignation, it is evident these systemic problems do not simply disappear as new people are elected into office. Lack of diversity and inclusion issues are ingrained in the organization in a way that cannot be easily remedied. 
The problem with USG’s priorities are even evident in its budget, which was more than $2 million in the last academic year, with $1.4 million devoted to programming. 
Concerts Committee, which puts on events like Springfest, received $600,000 out of this $1.4 million budget. Concerts Committee’s budget is greater than that of the Latinx Student Assembly, International Student Assembly, Queer and Ally Student Assembly, Environmental Student Assembly, Black Student Assembly, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly and Academic Culture Assembly combined.
The discrepancy of budget allocation between entertainment and cultural organizations raises the question of if the statements put out by USG are simply performative. If the organization truly cares about supporting diversity on campus and within the organization, budget reallocation is a concrete first call to action. 
The critical way in which USC students interacted with USG in the past few weeks undoubtedly led to changes in leadership. However, if there is decreased pressure on USG and a return to complacency following Fritz’s resignation, students have simply slapped a Band-Aid over a bullethole.
More than just replacing leadership, we must recognize the historical problems USG had, and will continue to have, if left unchecked. The student body must mobilize and increase voter turnout to put who they want into office. On the flip side, USG must create a more welcoming and inclusive space and expand its outreach to make people from a variety of backgrounds, races and cultures feel comfortable enough to run for office in the first place.

The University’s curriculum fails underrepresented communities on campus — specifically, the Black, Latinx and Native American students who cumulatively compose just 19% of the undergraduate population. The failure begins with USC leadership and works its way down through the faculty and to the student body. As low as the population of underrepresented students is, the population of underrepresented faculty is even lower. A shameful 9% of faculty identify as Black, Latinx or Native American. 
USC’s faculty diversity problem extends to gender as well. Just 39% of faculty identify as women. Interestingly enough, the only racial groups of faculty that are at or near gender parity are Black, Latinx and Native American. (There are just 2 Native American women on the faculty, but that’s near gender parity because there is a grand total of 3 Native American men.) 
On a level of basic decency, the University should seek to hire professors that are representative of this country’s diversity. Black and brown students ought to be able to take classes taught by people who look like them. Black and brown professors ought to be able to be hired equitably. Students ought to be able to read texts from diverse perspectives, and from scholars who had those particular students in mind when writing them. There does not need to be any argument beyond that, but there is because the education delivered by USC — and schools across the country for that matter — has consequences. 
USC’s failure to hire a diverse faculty leads to a failure to create diverse and inclusive syllabi. The University continues to elevate white male scholars and texts over those from underrepresented scholars, leading to a destructively restricted education for students. For instance, in a Sub-Saharan African politics course, there were 53 required readings of which only four were written by African men (no African woman made the cut). 
It is insidiously ironic and telling that in a class designed to educate students on diverse African societies and political structures, all study is limited by the white gaze. USC describes itself as a global research institution, but that cannot be true when it is stifling the work and perspectives of a majority of the world’s population.
Students cannot obtain a world-class education while the scholars they study belong to the same class of white men with access to elite institutions. This phenomenon becomes more salient in majors such as international relations — graduates cannot credibly claim to be an authority on international relations with an education that is focused primarily, if not exclusively, on the United States and Europe. 
In a recent letter spearheaded by professional fraternity Delta Phi Epsilon to the Department of Political Science and International Relations demanding changes in curriculum, hiring and student equity, students noted that they feel unprepared to be “the leading scholars who are competitive in both the academic and non-academic job markets.” The lack of diversity in the curriculum is harmful to the student body as a whole in that it often leaves graduates unequipped to take a truly educated and critical eye to many relevant issues, reinforcing higher-education biases while perpetuating the circulation of a body of knowledge that is decisively not all-encompassing.
The aggregate lack of diverse professors and diverse texts has negative consequences in all study areas and beyond academia. Race as a factor cuts horizontally across all areas of life, holding weight in everything we do, and to think otherwise is to be misinformed. It is therefore essential that students learn perspectives that challenge common knowledge. It is then, and then only, that they will be able to enter the workforce better equipped to excel in their work — whether that be diagnosing patients, running for office, criticizing art or any of the multitude of things that graduates from “elite” universities often go on to do. 
Black students know all of these things and have been expressing the need for change. This past month, Black students across USC schools sent detailed “Call to Action” letters to their respective deans outlining necessary changes to achieve equity and inclusion goals for Black Trojans. At the top of the list of demands were calls for additional Black professors and Black texts. It is a shameful reality that many Black students who graduated from USC have never been taught by a single Black professor.
That being said, the burden of advocacy for issues of diversity cannot constantly be relegated to Black students who have, quite frankly, had enough: Black students, and Black people in general, within predominantly white institutions have historically had to perform unpaid labor to advance their own collective condition and fight against anti-Blackness. 
All students ought to have a vested interest in having Black and brown professors and reading more texts authored by Black and brown scholars. All faculty members should see the consequential nature of the short and long-term value that having more Black and brown colleagues and teaching more Black and brown students brings. 
It truly cannot be understated how important it is that the University diversifies its faculty and curriculum. To bring about the systemic changes needed there must be a broad coalition of students and faculty demanding change today, not tomorrow.
