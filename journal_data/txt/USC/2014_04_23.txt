His name is Eric Calhoun, and if you’ve ever been to a USC baseball game, you know who he is. He is always the loudest, most boisterous fan at Dedeaux Field — the first to start a “Let’s go Trojans!” chant when the team needs a rally, or to urge the opponent to “quit stalling, already!” during a mound visit.

To be honest, Eric probably has no idea who I am. I interact with him briefly at almost every game, but we’ve never formally met, never spoken beyond a quick interchange, and I know for a fact he has never read my coverage of the team.
I can say that with such certainty because Eric is completely blind.
I contemplated approaching Eric several times for this piece; it would only be logical, after all, to talk to the subject. I wanted to ask him why he takes the bus from Crenshaw to be at just about every USC home game — and quite a few road games as well. I wanted to know how he does it: navigating from bus to ballpark, up and down bleachers and stairs, always by himself.
I realized, however, that answer is obvious: Eric loves the game, simple as that. But what I really wanted to ask was this: How does he know?
When Eric is at a USC game, he sometimes doesn’t even face the field — not that it would matter, I suppose. His eyes are open, but rolled to the back. Usually they are obscured by his hood, pulled low over his forehead. And yet Eric is somehow keenly aware of what is happening on the field. He knows if a ball is hit on the ground or in the air (he’ll urge a fly ball to “get going” when a Trojan hits it). He always knows the situation (“Make ’em hit it on the ground,” if the Trojans have the opportunity to turn a double play on defense). He can seemingly even tell if a pitch is a ball or a strike (“Throw strikes,” he’ll remind the young Trojan bullpen. “You gotta throw strikes”).
Is it the sound of the ball off the bat? The reaction of the crowd? Some sort of sixth sense? I’ve seen Eric stand next to the press box and listen to the announcers in there, but I’ve also seen him sitting many sections away. No matter what, he always seems to know exactly what is happening in the game. It is nothing short of amazing, and I came very, very close to asking him about it.
But I didn’t. Because it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter if it’s the sound of the bat or the crowd or if Eric is just the best guesser ever. Honestly, it doesn’t matter if his cheering even makes sense in the context of the game (although it almost always does). What matters is that he is cheering at all — not to mention there in the first place.
Eric is in many ways simply a fan — and a damn good one at that. But he is more than just that. He is an eminently recognizable presence, both visibly and audibly. Though he rarely asks for it, he is always thankful for any help he receives, be it a reminder when the next game is or simply letting him know he has walked past the ramp up to the stands at Dedeaux.
He is greeted with smiles he cannot see, yet returns them anyways with his devotion and commitment. That’s not to say he is perfect — many of us have had our fair share of difficulties with Eric. I recall him simply walking right past the ticket turnstile at Blair Field in Long Beach for a game there back in 2011. Chances are he had no idea he even did so, but the usher collecting tickets was understandably flummoxed.
USC has eight home games left in this 2014 season, and you can bet that Eric Calhoun will be at all of them. If you find yourself there with him, go say hi. I know I will. Eric might not be perfect, but he’s just about the perfect fan.

The USC baseball team kept its six-game winning streak alive Tuesday night against the University of Hawai’i, just two days before an all-important series with crosstown rival UCLA. The Trojans handily put away the Rainbow Warriors 10-4 at Dedeaux Field in one of their last weekday home games of the season. Sophomore Brooks Kriske commanded the game on the mound from the beginning, going 4.2 innings and allowing only one earned run on six hits. The Trojans were led at the plate by junior Jake Hernandez, freshman Jeremy Martinez and sophomore Timmy Robinson.

The Trojans can attribute their winning streak to vast improvement at the plate. On Tuesday, seven different Trojans had a hit, with four having multi-hit outings in the batter’s box.
Senior infielder Kevin Swick believes that the team’s newfound confidence at the plate has made a definite impact in helping to score runs and win games.
“We know now that we can get it done at the plate in the big spot,” Swick said. “That’s something we haven’t really been able to do in the past. It’s definitely exciting that we’ve finally gotten our hitting rolling. I know everyone on the team is feeling really confident right now.”
This weekend, the Trojans will take their crosstown rivals at Jackie Robinson stadium in Westwood. Thursday and Friday night’s games will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks at 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., respectively.
In 2013, the last time these two teams met, the Bruins swept the Trojans in an embarrassing weekend series at Dedeaux Field, during which USC struggled to turn hits into runs.
The Trojans believe that their recent hitting and winning streak will help to make this year’s series far more competitive.
“Tuesday’s game kept us on a roll and when you have momentum like that, you start to feel really confident, like you can face anybody, so that’s really huge for us going into this weekend,” Swick said. “We’re going to be facing a lot of good pitchers this weekend so we have to be as confident at the plate as we have been in recent games.”
This season, UCLA holds a 22-16 overall record, a 10-11 home record and a 9-6 record in the Pac-12. The team’s leading hitter is catcher Shane Zeile, who is hitting .353 so far. Brian Carroll is second on the team with a .282 average. UCLA’s total team batting average is .260 and total team ERA is 2.83 in comparison to USC’s marks of  .273 and 3.52.
The numbers indicate that USC could have the advantage this weekend in terms of hitting, given that the Trojans currently have four players batting over .300 while the Bruins only have one, but UCLA could hold the upper hand at the mound.
Last year, an offensively challenged Bruins team rode their pitching and defense to a national championship. The anchor of that pitching staff, closer David Berg, has been dominant this year with a 1.63 ERA in 25 appearances. Another key member of UCLA’s pitching staff has been RHP James Kaprielian, who is 5-3 with a 2.12 ERA in 10 starts this season.
Statistics aside, Swick feels the Trojans must, first and foremost, keep calm and focused to pull wins this weekend.
“We’re going to approach this weekend like any other weekend, but at the same time, it is UCLA and playing your rival is always challenging, especially on the road,” Swick said. “Our biggest challenge is going to be keeping our emotions in check and staying steady. If we do that, I think we’ll be good this weekend.”

After a successful five-year run as the head coach at Washington, former USC assistant Steve Sarkisian has made a triumphant return to Troy this spring. As his team readies itself for summer workouts and fall camp, Daily Trojan staff writer Cassandra Collins sat down with Sarkisian to get to know the man behind the headset.
Man for the job · Steve Sarkisian spent seven seasons as an assistant at USC under Pete Carroll before leaving to coach at Washington in 2008. Many speculated that Sarkisian was Carroll’s personal choice as a successor. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
 
DT: I saw the dance competition video from spring practice, the players were having a blast — can you tell me about that?
Sarkisian: [Chuckling] As a coach, you try different motivational techniques when you feel the timing is right and you can ascertain that the players need the change. So you switch things up and incorporate different techniques. They are always in the grind of it all; you’re going through it day-in and day-out. We have been doing some really difficult and competitive periods at practice. It could be a tackling drill, it could be the linebackers versus the running backs, and as a coaching staff we just felt like this would be a fun and constructive competition for our players. Ultimately here at ’SC we want to recruit great competitors, and no matter what the competition is, they should go for it. We take notice of the players who give it their best effort and have the ability to adapt to change.
 
DT: Talent aside, when you look to recruit a player, what attributes do you seek?
Sarkisian: I believe, hands down, in the following three: competitiveness, effort and energy. None of those three characteristics take talent. It takes a lion heart, it takes a want-to and willingness to extend themselves. I’m willing to invest in that player with those qualities.
In my opinion, there are innately competitive people and those who aren’t. Those are the unique people that I want on my team and that’s who we are in search of. A good coach will appreciate and work with a player’s desire to help make his team successful. You can witness it in someone on the field or sideline. That’s the key to a team’s success.
 
DT: You did not recruit any of the players you are coaching right now to come to USC. What steps have you taken to get to know the players? Do you feel it’s actually important to know them outside of football?
Sarkisian: Yes I do — very much so. I believe in, and have always had, an open-door policy, and now an always phone-on policy. The way our kids are being raised, this generation’s verbal communication skills are less effective. So I have to do my very best and try and make it a mission to acknowledge and verbally engage each and every one of my players as often as I can. I truly mean whenever, wherever I see them. So no matter where they are or whom they may be with at said encounter, I try to talk with them and ask several questions. I know at times I may have bordered on embarrassing them. However, my goal is next time I see them to reiterate and employ one of the answers they have given me to further understand who they are. Just to get to know them better. My intention is that they believe that I am truly listening to all of them and I am not just saying it just for the sake of saying it.
 
DT: Are there any moments you can recall that kept you personally motivated and helped you realize you were on the correct career path?
Sarkisian: Yes, there are several key moments and mentors. While you might not have them in your daily life any longer, you still recall their words and actions that have lifted you forward. If you are fortunate you still have the ability to speak with them as well.
As you know, I worked with Pete Carroll for seven instrumental years here at USC. He was unbelievable to me and every single day was a teaching moment which I tried to absorb. We had a tough loss at Oregon State one year and we had been number one in the country for essentially three years. Instead of taking it out on any of the coaching staff or brooding, he pulls me aside in the locker room and begins explaining to me what he is going say to the team, and how he is going to say it. He was coaching me at one of the most difficult times. That’s a leader.
 
DT: Since Pete Carroll was your mentor, do you try to incorporate some of his coaching strategies?
Sarkisian: When you are with someone so successful and for a long period of time, it is inevitable that you try and use their winning practices and plays. I have practice plans and things that are very similar, but we have our differences as well. First and foremost you have to work with what you have. You need to adapt to your players. So naturally different techniques become implemented. One of the last pieces of advice Pete gave me when I took the job at Washington was, “Go be you.” Because inevitably the real you  will come out when adversity strikes. So be you all the time under any given circumstance. You shouldn’t switch your personalities on your team or divide them.
 
DT: What unique coaching strategies do you bring to USC?
Sarkisian: I think schematically the way we play is very unique. We are a no-huddle offense now. The natural thought when people hear “no huddle,” they think that means spread. Spread are schools like Arizona, Oregon, Arizona State. Then they think pro-style, which is Stanford and very traditional like USC has been for a very long time. Now we are a no-huddle pro-style team. Essentially, we have blended the two and that style makes us extremely unique.
 
DT:  Do you use  catchphrases to get the players motivated before a practice or game?
Sarkisian: We actually do. One thing we have been getting going on that I really believe in is, “Who’s got it better than us?” They respond with a rousing “NOBODY!” It’s 90 degrees today and we are going to spring practice. You are walking across this magnificent campus, of academic superiority with a beyond-rich athletic history and football tradition. I mean, who does have it better than us?
 
DT: If you could change one rule in football, what would it be?
Sarkisian: Wow, there is a lot I would change. It’s a hot topic, but for me, the most essential rule change would be kickoffs. I don’t believe they are the best thing for our game. When you compare the number of kickoffs to the percentage of injuries that occur during that play, you will find it’s where the majority of injuries occur. So it’s time to review these statistics, and ask yourself: Is it worth it?
 
Sarkisian: We actually do. One thing we have been getting going on that I really believe in is, “Who’s got it better than us?” They respond with a rousing “NOBODY!” It’s 90 degrees today and we are going to spring practice. You are walking across this magnificent campus, of academic superiority with a beyond-rich athletic history and football tradition. I mean, who does have it better than us?
Huhhhh Jim Mora and UCLA have it better than you, Stevie.
UCLA surrounded by: Beverly Hills, Brentwood, Bel Air, Century City, Santa Monica.
USC surrounded by: the Crips, the Bloods, 18th St. gang.
UCLA 109 National Titles #1 in the nation
USC 3rd, behind UCLA and Stanford
UCLA ranked #11 in the world academically to
USC #76
Should I go on?
Apparently those who suckle at the taxpayers’ teat long enough come to believe that they are somehow EARNING their way. Too, in comparing the quantum of National Titles, it would seem relevant to also compare the number of teams fielded. And if one were to deem football the signature collegiate sport, well, Da Broons come up just a wee bit short there, yes? Has anyone candled Westwood’s Olympics history against that of Troy? Perhaps it is the afterglow of the 15April annual fleecing, of those who actually earn and produce, that  inspires parasitic pride in bRuination, to the accompaniment of that incessant giant sucking sound.
Yes, UCLA is a fine school.  Of course, the fact that you are a graduate presents a compelling counter-example.  
Run along, now, and go play on the freeway.
@ anno nimus … Will YOU always be a jerk? Probably
yup, probably.
Will he also cheat, like PC?
Good interview. When Lane got the big chair, I was skeptical. I mused out loud that SC might’ve given the job to the wrong Pete Carrollite. As far as I’m concerned, the jury is still out for me. I am a big Coach O guy and it upset me how he was treated. I know coaching is a what have you done for me lately and they lost to  that school to the northwest and Norte Dame, but I think the university should’ve given Coach O and his team another year to prove themselves. 12-2 is better than 10-4. As a foster child of the Trojan family (I didn’t go there, my uncle graduated from there and my sister taught there) I wish Sark all the best
Of course the jury is out.  He hasn’t coached one game at USC.  
I disagree about Coach O.  He knew that the job was his if USC beat UCLA, and probably his if USC played well.  Then, he got out-coached, and his team didn’t play well.  He did a good job in 2013, but he’s not the man to match wits against the cream of CF coaches.  Quite simply, USC needs THAT man.  We’ll see if it has one now.  As you say, the jury is out.     
Couple of comments:
1.  Sark, no-huddle, pro-style is NOT unique–it’s quite prominent in the NFL.  Dude, it’s in the name!
2.  Sark pointed out that today’s young people have not been brought up with effective verbal communications skills.  That candor surprised me–good for Sark.  I concur with him, and it’s hard to see how that is a constructive sign for our species.  I’m glad that Sark is forcing some verbal interaction on his players, but maybe he shouldn’t publicize his strategy in the school paper.  Everything, and I mean everything, that hits the media comes to the attention of today’s young people.  Privacy is so last generation.  
3.  I have never heard that most injuries occur on kickoffs.  That was not part of the dialogue during the failed effort to enact rules to slow the pace of games down.  Kickoffs cannot be hurry-up, so I guess the injury problems go well beyond plays per minute.   Thanks for pointing that out, Coach.

From time to time, one might hear about the startups that began their humble beginnings with napkin scribbles. But for Shareful, a recently launched app, the idea started on a pizza box.

“Kevin [Shen] came back from a conference and said, ‘Amy, I have this really cool idea’ … It was this picture on the back of a pizza box,” said junior Amy Kao, a founding member of Kindred Labs Inc.
Shareful, the first app to come out of Kindred Labs Inc., is an iPhone App (available on Android in the near future) that lets people fund their pick of a handful of causes just by eating at participating restaurants in the area.
“The goal of Shareful is to let people give more frequently and personally to causes they genuinely care about,” said founder Kevin Shen, a senior majoring in computer science and business administration.
After conceiving the original idea, Kao and Shen started playing around with the concept more and decided to bring Johnny Rusnak, a senior majoring in business administration, and Modupe (Mo) Alabi, a junior majoring in communication, onto the Shareful team.
“We believed that skill sets come later, and we believed that as long as the passion was there, then that was the most important thing,” Kao said.
As much as the team wanted to hit the ground running with the idea and help as many people as possible, they needed to focus in on a couple of restaurants and organizations.
“We couldn’t just jump into all of the causes in the world … So we started out small and picked a couple of causes that we have connections to,” Shen said. “For example, none of us are in Troy Camp, but we have friends in it, and their core values and their work is something that we believe in.”
Other organizations that benefit from the Shareful app include Elevate Africa, a nonprofit that funds local businesses in developing countries, the Downtown Women’s Center and Water Is Basic, a nonprofit dedicated to providing clean water in the Republic of South Sudan.
Here’s how Shareful works: When a customer orders from a participating restaurant, such as La Taquiza or Cup O’ Joy, he or she can tap the bright orange “Shareful” pad at the cashier to register the transaction. Once a buzz is heard, the app lets the customer choose which cause or nonprofit to give to.
“If they visit any of the restaurants on our app, they’ll pay as normal. No money gets transferred through the app, and they don’t have to do anything extra,” Kao said.
Though Bluetooth might sound like a more unconventional method of registering this type of information, Shen believes that it is the most efficient.
“With a QR code, it’s pretty insecure because anyone can take a picture of the QR code and then just scan it a ton of times,” Shen said. “With Bluetooth, it’s a lot safer because it’s much harder to replicate … and we thought that it would be fun to be able to tap.”
Another issue that the team ran into earlier was choosing the perfect name for the app.
“I guess we wanted the name to embody a lot of our spirit, so something that’s warm, happy, inclusive,” Kao said. “You want something catchy, not too long, just a lot of consideration went into it.”
But the team also had their share of success as well. For example, the design for their logo — a bright orange circle with “Shareful” written in white letters — came naturally.
“We were trying to figure out a warm color that’s kind of happy and not too intense … and orange just kind of stood out as a natural one that attract people.” Alabi said.
It’s obvious too, through the way they talk about the app and how each of the team members smile at each other, that there’s a special chemistry within the team.
“I think we mesh really well together, and we’re able to utilize all of our strengths … It’s stressful to balance with school and other obligations, but totally worth it,” Kao said.
At the moment, they’re working on the Android app, but before they make major expansions, the team wants to perfect their system.
“Everyone has a little bit of them wanting to exert effort into what they care about, so how can we put all of that together to become that force for good?” Shen said. “We make sure that we are nimble enough … that we can make changes as fast as we can without having to make sure all of the different places are on the same page.”
And with two of the four team members graduating this May there’s still a lot to be done, but they’ve conquered the hardest, yet most gratifying, part of the journey — getting Shareful published. But for Shen, there’s more to Shareful than just the app.
“It’s not about the app at the end of the day, it’s about the people,” Shen said. “So it really helps having that purpose there, it’s something that keeps us grounded … Even as the startup gets thrown around, it’s nice having that purpose there that’s beyond ourselves.”
This would be great if they could take political donations

When it was first announced that director Bryan Singer would be returning to the X-Men franchise to helm an adaptation of Chris Claremont’s classic “Days of Future Past” storyline, fans began salivating over the prospect of a film with the adamantium-bonded gonads to bridge the decades-spanning continuity divide between Singer’s first two films — let’s just ignore Brett Ratner’s much-maligned trilogy capper, The Last Stand — and Matthew Vaughn’s stylish, James Bond-inspired prequel, X-Men: First Class. With less than a month to go before its May 23 release date, X-Men: Days of Future Past is reportedly testing through the roof with preview audiences and seems on track to become one of the biggest blockbusters of the summer.
Claws and effect · Wolverine, once again played by Academy Award-nominee Hugh Jackman, is sent back in time to prevent a cataclysmic event that will spell doom for mutants and humans alike in Bryan Singer’s X-Men: Days of Future Past. The film will be in theaters May 23. – Photo courtesy of 20th Century Fox
Last week, however, the largely positive buzz surrounding the film took a backseat to a suspiciously timed lawsuit accusing Singer of sexual misconduct with a teenage boy in the late ’90s. Thirty-one-year-old Michael Egan III, an aspiring actor and model who was 15 years old when the alleged mistreatment began, has accused Singer, who is openly gay, and three other high-ranking industry executives of plying him with drugs and taking advantage of him repeatedly during a series of sordid pool parties in Encino, Calif. and Hawaii, some of them allegedly hosted by infamous dot-com burnout and convicted child molester Marc Collins-Rector.
Singer’s attorney Marty Singer (no relation), meanwhile, has categorically denied all of Egan’s claims, calling them “absurd” and “defamatory,” and the filmmaker, who insists he was shooting the first X-Men in Toronto during the time the abuse was alleged to have taken place, purportedly plans to countersue his accuser for “malicious prosecution.”
Even though the truth of Egan’s accusations will likely never be fully known, the scandal has nonetheless reignited a very old debate, one that flared up again earlier this year with the ugly, pointless exhumation of the Woody Allen-Dylan Farrow molestation case.
The ability to separate art from the artist is a challenge all of us struggle with to some degree. Often, it depends on the severity and recency of an artist’s supposed offense. The spectrum runs from gifted but well-documented jerks, such as Frank Sinatra, to lunatic geniuses such as the 16th century Italian painter Caravaggio, who is rumored to have castrated and murdered a romantic rival during a duel over the outcome of a tennis match.
Roman Polanski, a great filmmaker who has all but admitted to the rape of a 13-year-old girl, seems to be the go-to example whenever this argument is brought up. Can you watch masterpieces such as Chinatown and Rosemary’s Baby without being reminded of his crime? Can you chuckle at the slapstick antics of O.J. Simpson as Leslie Nielsen’s blundering partner Nordberg in the Naked Gun series without feeling guilty afterward? Can you admire the acting skills and underrated directorial prowess of Mel Gibson — seriously, go queue up Apocalypto on Netflix right now — without remembering all those vicious drunken tirades?
The answers to these questions are intensely personal, and to be perfectly honest, they should probably stay that way. After all, none of us have all the facts in these cases, and it would be a mistake to pretend otherwise. Social media, meanwhile, has proven itself a poor platform for discussing contentious, multifaceted issues, the kind that can’t be expressed in sound bites or 140 characters or less. The court of public opinion — at least the Internet and cable news version — has been reduced to the level of a gibbering, bloodthirsty peanut gallery, where opinions and rumors masquerade as hard evidence, willful ignorance insists upon itself and “guilty until proven innocent” seems to be the prevailing edict.
Despite all the attention the Singer scandal is currently receiving, it remains unlikely that this controversy will have any measurable effect on Days of Future Past’s box office haul. If the same allegations had surfaced regarding one of the film’s stars, 20th Century Fox would have had cause for concern. Luckily for them, however, the average moviegoer isn’t familiar with directors who aren’t named Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino or Steven Spielberg. Just to be safe, though, the embattled filmmaker skipped last weekend’s WonderCon, sending producer and franchise scribe Simon Kinberg in his place to tease fans with more of the Sentinel-heavy opening sequence that debuted during the MTV Movie Awards.
Days of Future Past was envisioned as a years-in-the-making cinematic event on par with The Avengers, and that’s exactly what it’s shaping up to be. The film, which involves Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) sending Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to unite the younger Professor X and Magneto against a common enemy, boasts an exhaustively impressive cast of new stars and old favorites, including Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy as Professor X, Ian McKellen and Michael Fassbender as Magneto, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, Peter Dinklage as the mutant-loathing industrialist Bolivar Trask, Anna Paquin as Rogue, Nicholas Hoult as Beast and American Horror Story’s Evan Peters as Quicksilver, the same character Aaron Taylor-Johnson is portraying in next year’s The Avengers: Age of Ultron.
So in closing, here’s a word of advice to all concerned X-fans: Rather than dwelling on the darkness that might or might not lurk in one man’s past, you should be looking toward the future of the X-Men franchise, because it’s never been brighter. Look closely enough, in fact, and you can already see 2016’s X-Men: Apocalypse cresting the horizon.

The recent warm weather, sunshine and thoughts of summer signal the end of the school year and the beginning of festival season. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival has already come and gone and Outside Lands isn’t until August; anyone looking to experience great music on a beautiful spring day should check out the Desert Daze music festival on April 26. Sponsored by Moon Block Party, the festival boasts bands such as Blonde Redhead, The Raveonettes, Autolux and Mystic Braves.
Design by Ethan Rechtschaffen
The event will take place at Sunset Ranch Oasis in Mecca, Calif., where  two main stages will alternate hosting acts, so concertgoers do not miss out on any music. The music won’t be the only draw, however. A variety of bars and food trucks will be available to attendees, and visual artists will also display work at the festival. Overnight camping will be available so concertgoers can remain in the festival mindset and not have to worry about getting home safely.
Phil Pirrone, the event’s curator and a member of Moon Block Party said, the festival’s majestic setting sets it far apart from the typical festival.
“The land completely dictates what the festival will be like. Sunset Ranch is a paradise between a couple different mountain ranges so there’s history there,” Pirrone said. “When you go there, it’s different than being in L.A. The air feels different, there’s less racket in the air. If you get there around 6:45 p.m. or 7 p.m., you’ll really appreciate the scenery; it’s called Sunset Ranch for a reason.”
With over 100 returning staff members, Desert Daze is set to be one of Moon Block Party’s biggest events. Pirrone said that since half of the festival’s staff are musicians, they have a unique perspective that goes into planning and running the festival.
Pirrone said the Desert Daze lineup boasts an interesting mix of established and up-and-coming bands, which was the organizers’ goal.
When curating the lineup, Pirrone and other members of Moon Block Party collaborate to build a cohesive group of acts. After each person makes a list of bands he or she wants to feature, the group meets to create the lineup. Though the main goal is to choose bands that complement each other and create an invigorating musical environment, the festival’s curators also want to provide a platform for lesser-known bands to receive recognition.
“More than half of this lineup [consists of] new and up-and-coming bands, so we put them on where people can see and hear them,” Pirrone said. “These are bands that we really believe in, giving those bands a little push.”
Enter Mystic Braves, one of these rising bands. Relatively new to the L.A. music scene, Mystic Braves is composed of Julian Ducatenzeiler (guitar and vocals), Tony Malacara (bass and vocals), Shane Stotsenberg (guitar and vocals), Cameron Gartung (drums) and Ignacio Gonzalez (keyboard). Inspired by 1960s psychedelic grunge music, the group draws inspiration from some of the members’ favorite bands such as Temples and The Beatles.
Though Mystic Braves is a relatively new band, they have experience playing Moon Block Party events. The first band to perform at the inaugural Desert Daze, Mystic Braves also graced the stage last year. After touring with Moon Block Party in Seattle, Washington and Austin, Texas, it seemed natural for the band to participate in this year’s festival.
“It’s going to be a magical time. I’m excited to see a bunch of my friends playing in front of larger crowds, and the headliners will be awesome to see,” Ducatenzeiler said. “Camping is always fun, so to be able to have that with the music will be fun. Later, we have our record release show, and we’re leaving for our national tour.”
In addition to playing Desert Daze, Mystic Braves will release its upcoming album, Desert Island on April 29 and then go on the road to promote it. The band previously released an eponymous LP. Just like Pirrone carefully considers the overall theme of Desert Daze, Mystic Braves strove to make “Desert Island” cohesive.
“On the first album we just had a lot of songs that we demoed on Garage Band, so we basically just had to pick 12 songs out of 20,” Ducatenzeiler said. “I think about everything like the themes, key, flow, tempo or whatnot, and then we record it, mix it, master it and send it off to the vinyl company.”
Moon Block Party is a group of artists and musicians based in Los Angeles. The group also puts on Moon Block Party Pomona, Beyond the Witching Hour and Moon Block Party San Francisco festivals. The group started as a group of friends who were in nine or 10 different musical groups until the members came together to build this festival. This year will be the third annual Desert Daze.
General admission tickets to Desert Daze are $45 and overnight camping passes are $65 for General Admission and camping. Guests can purchase tickets at http://moonblockparty.org/tickets.

It’s not every day that students get the opportunity to pitch their ideas for a nationwide media campaign on energy poverty to a five-time GRAMMY Award nominee. But on Wednesday, students in Professor Steven Lamy’s IR 210: “Introductory Theory and Analysis in International Relations” got to do just that.
Leading generations · Recording artist Akon spoke to students about the #PowerProject Campaign Lab, which had its first launch at USC. – Paul Jung | Daily Trojan
“I’m here because we are the voice of the future,” philanthropist and recording artist Aliaune Damala Bouga Time Bongo Puru Nacka Lu Lu Lu Badara Akon Thiam, popularly known by his stage name Akon, told IR 210 students Wednesday morning in Taper Hall of the Humanities.
“You guys are the next leaders, the next decision-makers, the next entrepreneurs,” he said.
More than 100 students joined Akon and representatives from the global advocacy and campaign organization, the ONE Campaign, for the first ever #PowerProject Campaign Lab. Making its debut at USC, the #PowerProject Campaign Lab is an opportunity for students to brainstorm ideas for ONE’s new social media campaign to combat energy poverty.
“Congress needs our convincing, which is why we launched the campaign lab to get your ideas,” ONE Campaign representative and IR 210 alumnus Michael Drachkovitch told students. “We believe that your generation is poised to make this difference and this change.”
ONE at USC President, Annette Aharonian, and director of recruitment Audrey Weber opened the program with a question and answer session with Akon in which both his own personal connection to the project and the power of celebrity diplomacy were discussed. Akon told the students about his reasons for supporting the project, sharing his own experiences in his native country of Senegal.
“I experienced lack of energy firsthand,” Akon said. “I grew up in a rural village where we used kerosene lights, and kerosene can be hazardous in so many ways.”
The remainder of the event was allotted for student groups to present their proposals for the ONE Campaign’s Power Project, an online letter-writing tool aimed at enabling people to send letters to their congressional representatives in support of bipartisan legislation to bring modern energy access to more than 50 million people in sub-Saharan Africa.
“It is a major IR issue — global poverty,” Professor Lamy said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We talk a great deal about human security, freedom from fear and freedom from want, and the issue fits perfectly with our class.”
Students assembled presentations of their own vision for the Power Project, integrating different social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. All proposals were geared towards the campaign’s ultimate goal of generating at least 50,000 letters sent to Congress between June 16 and July 31.
Of the 31 entries submitted, eight groups were given the opportunity to pitch their campaign proposal and receive feedback directly from Akon and ONE Campaign representatives. All proposals will contend to be the digital centerpiece of the Power Project.
“It was great that the ONE campaign came by and valued the voices of the millennial generation,” said Matthew Cheung, a sophomore majoring in international relations and the global economy. “One of the panelists said that we are really the core constituency of individuals that people on Capitol Hill and Congress are trying to reach out to, and trying to understand, because we have such an influential voice. Hopefully some of our ideas go through, and we’ll be able to influence some actual change in Africa.”
Students also were confident in the campaign’s potential.
“The ideas presented here were amazing,” said Alya Omar, a freshman majoring in international relations (global business), who also pitched her proposal to Akon and the ONE campaign. “Whatever they choose, it’s definitely going to make an impact. It’s definitely not going to be one of those campaigns that just falls through the cracks.”

Students and panelists gathered on Wednesday in The Forum at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center for the semester’s final installment of “Students Talk Back: A Politics and Public Policy Forum,” a semi-monthly forum presented in partnership with the Dornsife College of Letters, Art and Science’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, College Democrats, College Republicans and the Daily Trojan.
The theme for the discussion was, “Battle for the Ballot: Democratic and Republican Responses to California’s New Top Two Primary.”
The discussion was moderated by Kerstyn Olson, interim director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, and Jordyn Holman, an opinion columnist at the Daily Trojan.
They were joined by a panel made up of political consultants Garry South and Allan Hoffenblum, Sam Dorn, a member of the USC College Democrats, and Jordan Tygh, a member of the USC College Republicans.
The Talk Back addressed an issue facing voters this election season: candidates running for statewide and congressional office in a top-two primary.
The measure that established the change to primary elections, Proposition 14, took effect in April 2011 after being passed by voters in the 2010 election. It ended the traditional closed primary, in which voters of each party nominate a candidate for the general election, and replaces it with an open primary, in which the top two candidates —  regardless of party affiliation, advance to the general election.
Proponents of the measure say the law will reduce polarization, especially in California’s state legislature, and that candidates will be forced to expand their views to appeal to a wider swath of voters, not just their traditional party base.
Opponents of the measure say the two-party system weakens the potential field of candidates and fails to combat gridlock. Critics often cite that since the measure passed, no independents have been elected to statewide or federal office and very few have made it out of the primary as a reason the law has failed to reduce polarization.
Hoffenblum, a Republican political consultant, said the old system of closed primaries drew the extremes of both Democrats and Republicans and that the top two system would open the door to more diversity. South, who originally suggested the top two primary in 2004 as Proposition 62, agreed.
“I’m a longtime believer in open primaries and the top two primary,” he said. “In 1998, I ran Gov. Grey Davis’s campaign for governor — I’m the first and only person in California history to run a successful campaign that came out of an open primary.”
Dorn disagreed, citing the Los Angeles mayoral election as proof that third party candidates are still excluded by voters.
“[The top two primary] denies people of the opposite party the chance to run in a particularly Democratic or particularly Republican election,” Dorn said.
Tygh, Dorn’s equivalent from the College Republicans, disagreed and cited former Republican-turned non-partisan Bill Bloomfield’s challenge to longtime Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman as proof that there is space for independent candidates.
For Laura Walsh, a senior majoring in political science and environmental studies, who was undecided on the benefits of the two-party system, the panel clarified what she perceived to be the media misrepresenting the disadvantages of the top two primary.
“In terms of election results and the way our elected officials will vote, I think it will work in our favor,” Walsh said. “I think that contrasts what a lot of pundits are wanting us to believe because we hear a lot about this jungle primary, and they make it sound like it’s going to be unfair.”

On Wednesday afternoon, 60 students representing numerous campus organizations coordinated four sit-ins throughout campus, as well as a rally at Tommy Trojan, in opposition to the university’s continued business relations with the apparel brand JanSport.
The Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, the leading group of the sit-in and protest, claims that JanSport’s parent company, the VF Corporation, is directly linked to the deaths and ill treatment of numerous factory workers in sweatshops in Bangladesh.
At approximately 2:00 p.m., a group of 60 students staged the sit-ins at four locations: Vice President of Admissions and Planning Katharine Harrington’s office at Town & Gown, Vice Provost of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry’s office in the Student Union, the office of the Director of Trademark Licensing and Social Responsibility Matt Curran in University Village and the office of the USC Bookstore Director Dan Archer.
Sarah Newell, a member of SCALE and lead campaign coordinator of Wednesday’s sit-ins, said that the protestors’ presence was meant to demonstrate to  administrators that they can no longer ignore their students’ voices.
“[On Wednesday] 60 students from more than 45 groups across campus decided to occupy four different USC offices to let USC know that treating students this way isn’t going to silence us, and they can’t keep us down by treating us like criminals,” Newell said.
Newell was referencing campus administration’s response to an 18-student SCALE sit-in that occurred at Bovard Auditorium on Tuesday, April 15, during which participants were threatened with phone calls to parents, revocation of financial aid and suspension. The sit-in lasted for four hours and ended with no official resolution.
Following Wednesday’s four coordinated sit-ins, which lasted approximately two hours, protestors congregated at Tommy Trojan to rally for their cause and garner the attention of President C.L. Max Nikias, who members claim at the time was having tea with another student organization in the nearby Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The rally hosted three guest speakers, including Maria Elena Durazo, the general secretary of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
“I am proud you are doing this in the name of people in another part of the world,” Durazo said. “You are doing it because you care about anybody, everybody, anywhere — an injustice to someone anywhere is an injustice to everybody everywhere.”
Assistant Professor of Sociology Veronica Terriquez also spoke at the event, acknowledging the protestors’ ability to make a difference through their continued efforts.
“Students have a power to make history,” Terriquez said. “What you’re doing today can really have an impact when you’re working in solidarity with people across the world … Keep up the movement, keep up the fight.”
During the protest, some students also spoke about their experiences from the day’s sit-in. SCALE member Liz Fernandez claimed Harrington made light of the student’s efforts.
“She snapped a couple of pictures [of us] to send to everyone … She told us over and over that our little protest wasn’t going to get us anywhere,” Fernandez said. “To hear an administrator say to me that my voice doesn’t need to be heard is absolutely ridiculous.”
Harrington could not be reached for comment.
SCALE members spoke with the Daily Trojan after the event and mentioned that following the Bovard Auditorium sit-in last week, students outside of the organization have expressed concerns with the university’s actions.
“The results of [last Wednesday’s] sit-in are really what produced this effort here today, because all these students here today — many of whom are not affiliated with SCALE — were so disgusted when they heard about what happened in the office and how we were treated,” said Francesca Bessey, a junior majoring in international relations.
SCALE member Andy Su noted that outside support highlights how far the organization has come.
“Following the sit-in from last week, people have been coming up to me and saying, ‘It’s really messed up what administration did.’ My response is, ‘Yes, they’ve been doing this for the last eight months,’” Su said. “To see the public responding positively and supporting us — we’re really on the brink of change here.”
This is SCALE’s second rally since the Bovard sit-in last week, and campaign coordinator Hannah Nguyen stressed that the organization will continue to act until they are addressed by campus administration.
“Workers’ lives are still on the line every single day, so we’re going to continue fighting on these last weeks of school and onto next year if necessary,” Nguyen said. “But we hope that by the end of the school year, USC will decide to start respecting student voices and the lives of workers.”

The Supreme Court has the double-edged task of preventing the tyranny of both the majority and the minority from infringing on the Constitutional principles enshrined in law for more than 200 years. When the Court places too much faith in either of these bodies, democracy runs afoul of its true purpose at best and has the potential to destroy human liberty at worst.
In the latest affirmative action decision handed down Tuesday, the Supreme Court bordered dangerously close to the latter. The lesson society will learn the hard way due to that decision is that sometimes it’s not enough to trust the majority to protect the rights of the minority. In some cases, the Court has to protect those rights actively, and not passively, and affirmative action is one of those situations.
In a decision handed down on Tuesday in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, the Supreme Court upheld the state of Michigan’s ban on affirmative action.
To understand why this decision veers in a dangerous direction, it’s important to know what happened to place the Court at this juncture. In the 1977 landmark affirmative action case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a divided Supreme Court held that it was constitutionally permissible to use race as a factor in admissions decisions.
The Court limited this decision in later cases, notably in the 2002 decision of Grutter v. Bollinger, which held that the University of Michigan’s affirmative action policy that awarded 20 points to the application of an underrepresented person violated the Constitution’s equal protection clause. A year later, the Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School’s affirmative action policies on the grounds that it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest in maintaining diversity.
In 2006, Michigan voters banned affirmative action altogether via Proposal 2, an initiative on the November ballot that amended the state constitution to end sex- and race-based preferences in public education, employment, and contracting. The ballot measure was challenged in federal court the day after it passed and, not surprisingly, an exit poll that year revealed that two-thirds of white voters supported ending affirmative action. Only one in seven black voters agreed.
The case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court. Though previous affirmative action cases asked the court to decide on the constitutionality of a particular affirmative action policy, Schuette presented the opposite problem; whether or not a law that bans the practice all together should remain on the books.
For a clear example of the preposterous nature of laws that ban consideration of race entirely, consider that most schools are allowed to ask if a student is a legacy (has family ties to the university) and consider that information in their decisions. If a black student (whose race carries more weight than a legacy connection ever could) wants to have that considered, they have to amend the state constitution first.
As long as the majority is implicitly (and usually explicitly) biased toward traditionally racist structures, the Court has a duty to intervene. In many cases, it is the last resort for the minority. Brown v. Board of Education was not decided on the basis that southern states could be trusted to integrate their schools. We should hold the same line with affirmative action.

Individuals have inalienable rights. Groups only have a subset of rights delegated by
the individuals that make up the group. While one may be born to a racial group, it does not prevent one from adopting alternative cultural values.
Affirmative action should be a school’s decision, not a third party’s decision. Admission standards change over time – and rightfully so.
There once was a place for AA,  but it has been abused over the decades.  Back in the 90’s men were passed over for promotions or new jobs in fsvor of less experienced women,  who’ve eventually performed atca substandard level.  
In the case of women,  they want equal pay for equal work,  but in some jobs that can’t be,  and that holds true with physical jobs. 
The entire equally position is not going to be perfect. You only hope that it is reasonable. 
At USC gor example,  you can have a 4.0+ GPA and not be accepted as a freshman.  This is because the University is marketing the school to Asian countries and fullly paid students. SCions arent even being accepted as freshman and are told to come back as Sophomores or juniors. 
Hyde other day or was announced on LA radio that for the first time,  the UC system is anything more Latinos than any other student profile. Why?  Affirmative Action. 
That’s wrong. AA needs  to be abolished. 
It makes sense to ban the use of racial preferences in university admissions, because such discrimination is uniquely ugly.  The dubious “diversity” justification (that students will be enlightened by random interracial conversations) is overwhelmed by the many, heavy, and undeniable costs of using race in admissions:   It is personally unfair, passes over better qualified students, and sets a disturbing legal, political, and moral precedent in allowing racial discrimination; it creates resentment; it stigmatizes the so-called beneficiaries in the eyes of their classmates, teachers, and themselves, as well as future employers, clients, and patients; it mismatches African Americans and Latinos with institutions, setting them up for failure; it fosters a victim mindset, removes the incentive for academic excellence, and encourages separatism; it compromises the academic mission of the university and lowers the overall academic quality of the student body; it creates pressure to discriminate in grading and graduation; it breeds hypocrisy within the school and encourages a scofflaw attitude among college officials; it papers over the real social problem of why so many African Americans and Latinos are academically uncompetitive; and it gets states and schools involved in unsavory activities like deciding which racial and ethnic minorities will be favored and which ones not, and how much blood is needed to establish group membership – an untenable legal regime as America becomes an increasingly multiracial, multiethnic society and as individual Americans are themselves more and more likely to be multiracial and multiethnic (starting with our president).
The real question is are they selecting students based upon race or based upon ability. Yes, I understand that in some circumstances some people are given the ability to have a better education than others, and this can be seen in racial divides.  However, there is another group that gets put out in the cold with affirmative action and that is the student who scored better on tests and worked very hard to get into college but can not get the better college to look at them because there are too many of their race…and a minority is allowed in who worked less hard. We have become a nation that not only discriminates against race but now discriminates against ability as well. How about this, give everyone a number…dont allow anyone to place sex or race on a college entrance exam and then judge only on scores…no legacy…no minority…no gender…just plain ability. Take all the money used to keep affirmative action in place or fight it in courts and send it to free public colleges where everyone else who WANTS the education gets one as long as they keep grades up. Too socialist I am sure for most people…free education…what horrible thing will someone think up next?
Yes, whites should be ejected from this country.  They can go elsewhere.

South Korean President Park Geun-hye arrives at the Jindo gymnasium, where parents and loved ones of those caught in the wreckage are camping and awaiting any news of a potential rescue. She is escorted to the stage by a group of officials, her eyes glazed and half-shut with fatigue, her lips pressed into a somber grimace. She begins to address the crowd with reassurances of rescue efforts and asks for their understanding, when she is cut short by an uproar from the audience — parents yelling and screaming.
“What do you want me to understand?” a man screams. “If you had a daughter who was freezing to death in the ocean water, would you understand?”
Such are the scenes portrayed on Korean television network Seoul Broadcasting System in its news documentary Sewol Sinking, which aired on the SBS television network earlier this week.
The news documentary covered the response to one of South Korea’s largest national tragedies, the recent sinking of the ferry Sewol off the coast of Jindo, South Korea. As of press time, USA Today reports that 159 people are confirmed dead and 143 more are still missing. Out of 476 individuals on board, 174 have been rescued.
Among the first individuals rescued was Sewol Captain Lee Jun-seok, who abandoned ship along with members of his crew while the vast majority of his passengers were left behind.
Lee instructed his crew not to let passengers evacuate immediately while the ship was listing. Lee’s primary concern was that the turbulent ocean conditions might disperse evacuees and make them difficult to track down and rescue. He issued an evacuation order 35 minutes after sending out a distress signal, telling passengers to stay in their cabins until otherwise instructed, according to BBC News.
Lee’s actions did not come from an understanding of standardized evacuation procedures. The lack of experience and emergency preparedness of the vessel’s crew members only expose inadequate governmental enforcement of even rudimentary evacuation training in a country that is considered to be one of the most technologically advanced and highly developed in the Pacific Rim.
South Korea is a thriving westernized democracy that, to the world at large, is renowned for its cutting edge semiconductor and consumer technologies in addition to a rapidly growing automobile export industry.
This national tragedy, however, has brought many of the country’s lesser-known issues to the forefront. It seems as if everyone has a reason to point a finger in the tragedy to push an agenda. In addition to the countless moral indictments against Lee, a Korea Times editorial published last Friday pointed to the fact that the ship had loaded three times the recommended weight of cargo, ostensibly making it more difficult to handle.
The most unsettling instance of finger pointing, however, actually came from South Korea’s president.
“The actions of the captain and some of the crew are absolutely unacceptable, unforgivable actions that are akin to murder,” Park said Monday in a statement released from her office.
Park’s statement encapsulates the sentiment of many Koreans who feel sadness and outrage at the events which transpired last week. But the statement serves a dual purpose: It deflects attention from the administration’s shortcomings and points to the actions of an individual as the gravamen for the tragedy.
South Korea is still in the wake of a national disaster, and there are missing people to be recovered. Yet for its president to so swiftly point the finger at Lee and call his actions “akin to murder” smacks of political maneuvering at a time where a head of state should be stabilizing its people and understanding the actual issues that contributed to the tragedy.
This is not the first South Korean ferry accident that occurred partially as a result of a vessel being over capacity: In 1993, the MV Seohae sank and killed 292 people. In addition to heavy cargo and inclement conditions, the ship was carrying 362 people, despite a legal maximum capacity of 221 passengers.
The greatest disservice to the passengers of the Sewol has been the fact that history has been permitted to repeat itself. Adding insult to injury is the Park administration, which is exploiting Lee as a scapegoat to cover up the failure to properly enforce laws that protect the nation’s citizens.
In the aftermath of a national tragedy, it is incumbent upon the head of state to respect the gravity of the situation and find ways to implement enforcement of safety regulations so that history does not repeat itself yet again. Park’s desperate politicization of the mourning process is a disservice both to the families who lost loved ones in last week’s tragedy and to South Korean democracy. Despite their recent arrests, Lee and his crew are not the ones solely at fault for the ferry’s sinking, and they shouldn’t be made easy scapegoats for government under-enforcement and a shipping company’s greed.
What happened in South Korea was a national tragedy — but the onus is on the South Korean government to effect meaningful changes and resist the political inclination to be the playwright.

Professor Robert Springborg, a recent retiree from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate school in Monterey and an expert on Egypt and its military, spoke to students in Ronald Tutor Campus Center Tuesday afternoon about the structure and role of the Egyptian military during and after the revolution in 2011 that deposed former president Hosni Mubarak. The event was sponsored by the Middle East Studies Department.
Springborg, who is a visiting professor on war studies at Kings College, London and the director of the American Research Center in Cairo from 2000-2002, discussed the structural characteristics of the Egyptian military, internal politics of the country, and what policy the US should pursue in the region.

“This is a significant military by any measure and certainly in the Middle East,” Springborg said. “If you want to look at control of the military in the Arab world, you can’t use the standards you would for a democratic state.”
The Egyptian military, which is 500,000 strong with both significant armored and air capability, is the largest military force in Africa and one of the larger military forces in the world. Springborg compared different aspects of the military to the militaries of many countries in South America, where literature on the role of the military is widely available.
“Brazil, for example, has a GDP that’s ten times higher than Egypt, yet military is 40 percent smaller,” he said. “In terms of the share of the economy, the Egyptian army is much larger.”
He said that one metric to measure the size of the military is to look at the number of soldiers and officers per 10,000 civilians. In Egypt, the number is 190, and if you include barracked police forces, it is as high as 415. He said the average in Latin America, by comparison, is closer to 30.
He also noted that the military operates its own court system where civilians can be tried. Under a previous constitution, civilians could be tried for “crimes that harmed the armed forces” in military courts. That definition was narrowed under the 2014 constitution, but still gives the military sweeping judicial authority.
“The military has basically empowered itself to try whoever it wants under its own court system,” Springborg said.
The military conscripts 325,000 per year, but Springborg said that a large portion of them are used for labor in the military factories and other companies. He said it is typical to serve the last six months of a three-year conscription in military company, while still earning conscript wages.
“You have a large army for show so that you can justify having a large officer corps that you enrich and are loyal to you, and that helps protect the presidency,” he said. “It’s highly stratified [and] inward-looking — it’s not focused on fighting, but on enriching itself.”
The talk then shifted to the internal politics of the military, and the restructuring that took place during the revolution. The professor referenced incidents of corruption and cronyism within the military. He spoke in particular about Field Marshal Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, a presidential candidate in Egypt who previously controlled the Ministry of Defense. Springborg said al-Sisi has consolidated power by placing supporters in key government positions.
“It is the first time in the history of the republic of Egypt that a single figure is going to control the presidency, the ministry of defense, and the ministry of the interior,” he said.
Springborg said the United States lost face when dealing with the Egyptian military following the ousting of President Mubarak. He referenced an incident when the military, headed by Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, was angered by the US sending $63 million in aid to civil society and humanitarian efforts in the country. Then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton chose to suspend the payment, which Springborg said was symbolic of the US handling of the situation.
“[The United States] didn’t back the revolutionaries either in word or in deed,” he said, “We realized this was a two-horse game, when the [Muslim Brotherhood] failed, we switched horses and now back the officers.”
Students who attended the event found it informative and engaging.
“I didn’t realize how big the military in Egypt was and I didn’t know how different it was from other countries particularly in terms of its size relative to the economy,” said Erica Behrens, a sophomore majoring in international relations.
Biz Peabody, a junior majoring in psychology and international relations, enjoyed hearing Stromberg’s point of view.
“It’s interesting to hear these kind of inside analyses,” Peabody said. “he has a counterintuitive perspective on some issues that were really fascinating to hear about.”

An open letter of gratitude to all ’SC students, alumni and faculty, who stood up or reached out to help Boston, and one of our own who was badly injured, become stronger after the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing: Thank you!
Though it has been many years since I attended my last class on campus and returned to Boston, when I found out one of our own ’SC alum was injured at the finish line and was in need of financial and emotional support I reached out to current and former SC students, alumni and faculty for help and the response was overwhelming
The last update on the ’SC alum was good news! She underwent multiple surgeries but was walking again and in the process of putting the pieces of her life back together.
Now we face another challenge: getting through the one-year anniversary. The Boston airwaves have been saturatedwith video and images of the tragedy and someone even decided to sabotage the memorial/tribute event by showing up barefoot, dressed in black, wearing a veil and dropping of a backpack on the ground forcing an emergency response and evacuation.
I am writing this letter today to ask my Trojan Family to keep Boston and all those impacted by the events of last year in your thoughts, especially as we move through the next few days.
April 15 marked the one-year anniversary since the bombing, but April 21 was the next Marathon date as it always falls on the third Monday of April.
We are Trojan Strong and together we make Boston Strong!

The USC Sports Business Association hosted a panel Tuesday in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center with industry leaders Jeff Borris, a sports agent at Beverly Hills Sports Council; Steve Harden, Vice President of Sales at Oakley; Brendan Meyer, Senior Director of Digital Marketing at Wasserman Media Group; and Ryan Lawrence, Vice President of Business Development and Strategy at Relativity Sports.
The event began with an introduction to the panel by senior Annenberg lecturer and Sports Business Association faculty advisor Jeff Fellenzer. Fellenzer dove right into a spirited conversation with the group, asking how they got to their current positions and what they look for in job candidates at their respective companies.

Borris discussed his career path through law school along with how networking and persistence helped get him started.
“A friend of mine from elementary school who was working full-time at BHSC invited me down to spring training while I was interning and I was able to recruit Jose Canseco as a client. It just took off from there,” Borris said. “It worked out so well I had to rearrange my law classes since I was so busy at work.”
He has since negotiated over $1 billion worth of sports contracts for BHSC.
Lawrence began his career on Wall Street and followed up by getting his MBA at USC Marshall School of Business four years ago.
“Everyday when I go to work I’m excited about what I want to do [and] I was able to find my true passion and parlay a lot of what I learned on Wall Street into my current position,” Lawrence said. “USC was where I was able to hone in on my skills and really get a better understanding of what I wanted to do.”
When questioned about a typical day in the life of each panelist, they all laughed and agreed that no two days were alike.
“It depends on what time of the year it is,” Borris said. “Baseball’s offseason is my busy season, especially during salary arbitration when we have to prepare cases for each of our clients who are going through a process similar to a trial, which is where my law degree kicks in.”
Harden splits his time between Northern California, where his family lives, and Oakley’s headquarters in Orange County.
“I usually like to start my day around 6 a.m. and jump right into my work which then switches into meetings with my team,” he said. “Oakley has a young team in our office, which helps keep things moving and motivates me to always be on my toes.”
USC alumnus Brennan Meyer started out in athlete marketing and has been with Wasserman Media for seven years. Meyer focused his words for the students on the importance of relationship building to growing a career in the sports business.
“Its all about your ability to interact and carry on relationships with people,” Meyer said. “You never know when one person you were working with who is in a junior role on a deal will get a new job and become a decision maker at another company, that’s where the relationships come into play.”
A theme echoed throughout the night by both Fellenzer and the panelists was how vital networking was to their own success and the future success of students in the audience. Harden asked the audience how many students had a LinkedIn account.
“If you want to connect with me, send me a note and not just a general LinkedIn invitation, give me a reason to want to call you back,” he said.
Sports Business Association President Brennan Wise, a sophomore majoring in business administration, was extremely pleased with the groups first event.
“We were so excited to have such a great turnout at our first panel event,” he said. “Our goal is to engage as many students as possible across USC that are interested in Sports and Business by providing them with access to talented professionals in the Los Angeles area.”
Fellenzer closed out the evening by discussing how important it is that all students, especially those in the Sports Business Association take advantage of the resources USC has to offer.
“One of the great things about being at USC is the opportunity to connect with top people in their respective industries, in this case its sports and business,” Fellenzer said. “It shows how strong the USC brand is when industry leaders are willing to take time to connect with students and give them insight as to what its really like on the front line of their business.”
